The game doesn‚Äôt work on windows 3.1x
---
---
---
it happened to me once. also cleared all my displays. took an hour to fix everything D:
---
Not yet but just wait there will be group content like raids eventually.
---

---
They will kick people for not having bloodied.
---
I did herd cows, but the sheep was glowing blue plasma and refused to be herded üò¢
---
Happens to me CONSTANTLY (also on PS4).  I have now given up doing it on public servers.  Have tried on private servers, but generally end up with my friends just freezing in position and it all going wrong.
---
I now just run them myself.  Did one on Sunday.  It booted me 3 times!!! Once at the start and twice in the reactor.  FINALLY launched it and i got the blue screen of death.  Luckily as on private I could log back in and farm the nuke, but it is always a massive hassle.
---
But the thing that really gets me is the fact that when i get booted and re-enter - all the stuff i took has not re-spawned and there are still dead robots everywhere but everything re-sets.
---
I have it at 2 and rarely get crippled def worth at least the 2 point investment.
---
You posted and I Quote: 
---
&gt;lol. Show me the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù then.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;hint it‚Äôs exactly what I posted.
---
Therefore you must work for the company?
---
Hey, were you nuked down since you installed your camp there? I thought about installing my camp somewhere in that area but I never did because I was too afraid people would just aim for it ...
---
I like having my camp in a dangerous area but risking a nuke is a bit too much lol.
---
True but compared to other builds, everyone should just run bloodied or junkies.
---
Just happened for the first time for me
---
I would need a emote that makes my guy bust out laughing and point and bending over laughing
---
Not really my point, level is irrelevant with these OP players melting everything.
---
your probably on 32bit windows?
---
I love my easy access to food if I need it :)
---
I wear all my Armor regularly.  I have one of each modded out with different paints.  Like my t60 BOS paint the best right now.  All of them get me through SBQ and Nuke zone runs without issue. T65 just doesn‚Äôt have paint options what so over so it‚Äôs limiting in that regard.
---
Now we've all heard the stories about Saitama, the one punch man, and how he claims to have gotten his strength by doing 100 pull ups  , sit ups , and squats as well as a 10k run every day .....
---
However I think most vault dwellers are smart enough to recognize the truth,Saitama didnt just get stronger by a workout,  he got  stronger by beating the shit out of stuff,  realizing that ultimate strength means discarding the frail armaments of man , and  honing the primitive meatclubs of old called fists on the most durable of opponents !!!!
---
So next time you see these daring pugilistic individuals,  think of Saitama,  and  consider reverting to the oldest of man's weapons, his fists .
---
As all we are.
---
Ooh, mods should add some new flair!
---
Raids require specialization in 90 percent of the games they exsit in
---
As long as they fix the radio in that place.
---
I wasn‚Äôt giving a complete list of magical effects, just some examples. 33% VATS chance is another magical effect.
---
For my unarmed junkie i usually try to go one vanguard and the others one each of the -15% from each damage type (scorched..ghouls..super mutants etc etc) and the minor perk of weight reduction to chems/food/stuff
---
I have a combat rifle I tote around for tagging enemies without killing them. Just has a couple QOL effects on it, so it doesn‚Äôt do much damage but makes for something handy in a group.
---
Over my dead body
---
Mentioned this below - it's gimmicky at best. It's bad because even the best PA build gets outclassed by someone wearing a clown suit and full set of uny / assassins + sentinels. But now they're getting our gimmicks... secret service armor has a jetpack now. All those other things you mention can be gotten with perks. Minus the looking cool part. Unless you consider a clown costume and wiffle bat skin cool.
---

---
Good deal man!
---
There‚Äôs a double score weekend? How did I not know of this, is it this weekend?
---
Wow. Very interesting. I'm glad the devs set companions up with these animations.
---
I'm not sure what level I am off the top of my head, and I don't care all that much. I wanted the Sheepsquatch Plushie and I got it, everything else is gravy.
---
I would like to know how many people actually like the various Ghillie suits and Power Armor skins. I have no use for either and they really feel like wasted levels. It wouldn't bother me but it feels like at least 20% of the "rewards" are things I have absolutely no use for.
---
Only in game when you are.
---
oh and look around for Lead nodes if you use standard firearms, Acid nodes are also nice , I have a lead acid cliff Camp that was aaf to set up but It‚Äôs basicaly free ammo that lets me dump anything I‚Äôm not useing into the converter or vendors.
---
Or bottle necking the hallways, making it unnecessarily crowded
---
thanks!
---
Not really, like all the perks it is build dependant.  
---
For my main build it is gonna be god tier for my survival (and assist my teams survival) since rads are by far the greatest threat to him. Ghouls and radworms will fuck up that character, so it will probably be the first maxed perk i get
---
But for him PA perks are usless since i use the stealth suit.  And melee perks would be useless since he is a rifleman
---
Thank you!
---
Yeet. 4 days worth. Only applies to dailies. So you can finish the weekly when it drops.
---
In order to balance player weapons you gotta balance enemies and player armor pieces too. Like all the specific legendary prefixes should definitely be better than any bloodied weapon and unyielding pieces in defense but only to that specific enemy.
---
Right now as is, bloodied/unyielding is universally better than anything else. If you scale back bloodied some to 50% more damage  aligned to junkies and put the other legendary prefixes at 70% more damage to specific enemies it'll balance things out. 
---
You simply can't have universal builds in this type of game. It causes a monopoly that makes everyone only 1 or 2 types of build sets.
---
What they can do to unyielding is make new sets that stack unyielding with extra defense and damage one specific mob type at the cost -1 special Stat so it'll be +2 to all stats instead of +3 but you'll do more damage and take less damage from that mob type.
---
true but just two specialization for fallout 76, bloodied and junkies.  
---
Nice and they won't nerf them since they will get so much negative feedback.
---
Not easier than managers desk at the generals steakhouse - you won‚Äôt have to swap cards
---
There are far more than just 2. Just because that all you ever see dosent mean other dont exsit
---
Played 3 matches today....all three ended with someguy using frog legs and that bleeping shotgun......o well.
---
This is assuming you have all the dmg res perks for non pa.. Then vanguard has diminishing returns above 300 or so dmg res.. that's why the -15%per type come in handy
---
Hold on and Wait seem very useful for nuclear winter
---
Same here I made a themed bar and bed for people. Tell me what you think.[Cryptid Inn](http://imgur.com/gallery/AQf0SNq)
---
I currently use Windows 10, not a variant of Windows 3.1
---
No... I just follow the game and know my way around an internet archive...
---
oh aye. definitely. i'd be all for a nerf to both. i don't need that much damage. And people certainly don't need the damage bloodied gives.
---
I'm using 64 bit windows
---
It doesn't affect me,  its about doing exploits and trying to claim "I didn't know its is against the ToS that I signed to make my account."
---
\---
---
Since it has been fixed, i will walk you through the steps I was told.
---
First enter 'god mode' (which involves dying via radiation.
---
Then when you are unable to die, effects stack, then take 1.4k-1.5k xp boosting bobbleheads.
---
Exit god mode via the same method of getting into it.
---
Then use the 2 hours of super xp to go up hundreds of levels.
---
...
---
So, if you did that, you might as well have sent a signed invite to todd himself saying: 'I use exploits and buy duped items.'
---
My base is across from the Rusty Pick and sees visitors often. I have been selling lots of stuff in my vendors and make more caps that way than any other.
---
I'm on PS4, all my friends have my real name set and nothing :/ thank you though
---
This is similar to what my junky friends use as well.
---
Yess!! finally someone suggesting something.
---
Well they are balancing enemies with One Wasteland so they should address this.
---
The bloodied synergy is crazy and i like the idea but put some timers on these things, i believe that there true intention was not for people to be at 20% forever.
---
20 second for each low health bonus except bloodied.
---
Unyielding should be a temporary buff when you are about to die, not a permanent buff. They could probably remove the charisma to, that offers nothing for combat.
---
got a lot saved to imgur. Also screenshots of some of my pics are saved on [gamerdvr.com](https://gamerdvr.com).
---
Tbh I didn't even know the enclave were in the game
---
Yikes! This sounds seriously bugged!
---
I‚Äôm running dodgy right now due to adrenaline being broken. It‚Äôs just ok. I would rather quickly kill things, than stand around and tank damage.
---
Looked like windows 3.1x
---
I just use the stealth suit or PA on my junky personally. When I'm wearing armor I still usually just wear SS unyielding. Damage resist seems generally pretty useless compared to damage reduction anyway.
---
Both are agility right? What perks do you recommend in agility?
---
If a server has bad lag to it,... there is a brief moment when it spawns in you can do damage that is applied before it becomes invulnerable.
---
Some players I‚Äôve seen one shot it at the right moment. Always spawn in the same spot.
---
Oh sweet Jesus!
---
I flagged you all over here for the legendary while it whooped on me......now it's dead and I can't loot the damn thing because ten of you are standing on top of it.
---
I understand why people one shot the thing and screw everyone else over.
---
hmm i wonder if its something new. Its quite obnoxious
---
THICC boi
---
Damn this is a great shot, I want this as my phone background
---
People often complain that some, especially bloodied, builds are way too op for the game. In Enryptid, if there are only bloodied builds, you're not gonne have an easy time, since they will most likely not survive for long. 
---
Another event that fits that category is radiation rumble. Sure they can kill the mobs, but can they survive the rads? No.
---
They do exist i use one currently and it is pretty good but it wont stop people demanding bloodied since it is the strongest.
---
If they ever do a real pvp group mode then we will see even more elitism.
---
So sad there were just 3. I launched it today and I believe others 10 players joined.
---
I must have misunderstood you? Thought you was saying you wrote the post for the Fallout 1st Advertisement Page.
---
Rule one of fight club is you don't talk about fight club.
---
Ugh i feel that, I thank fully dont have displays so it only took me like 15 minutes. But adding all the plans back is such a pain
---
No such luck with this one. It spawned invisible and stayed invisible the whole event
---
Yeah that Serendipity tho. 40% chance to completely avoid damage (if you're not wearing PA) sure would be worth every pretty little point. I'd trade emergency protocols for it any day. And now this other new legendary perk giving non-pa users 40% damage reduction, pretty much makes the argument moot too. Again, useless.
---
[](/ktwistarswirl)Greetings my fellow wizard. I do the fashionable raider outfit, and Mr. Clause beard with the witch hat to really knock it home, bonus points if you have the burning sheepsquach staff.  
---
  
---
It's oddly hilarious helping new players while pretending it's a fantasy game.
---
Aw man i‚Äôm ps4- best of luck on your search!
---
I don‚Äôt believe people get banned for reputation exploits they just try to patch them when they see them. 
---
A dupe glitch is a lot worse as it can destroy the in game economy whereas reputation really doesn‚Äôt do much
---
Nothing happens. Once you're done, you're done. Additional points do not give you anything else.
---
As for nw, it's useless as in no more unlocks, but you still continue getting perk packs.
---
Again... depends on server lag.
---
Just a little bit so we don't have queens or the new Nuke boss going down in under 2 minutes.
---
This whole thing spawned since someone complained about the sheepsquatch being one shot. (probably by melee)
---
I‚Äôm set up on a cliff near Morgantown just behind Fraternity Row. There‚Äôs a house with a lot of cat bowls for you plastic hunters, stop on by if you‚Äôre on XB.
---
4250 bullion for the set plans. 1500 additional for buttressed mod. 
---
Now you get to play the lottery trying to get the right effects. So add countless mats and buckets of legendary modules.
---
There was only 3 of us there, I dont think any bloodied. I havent started my bloodied build yet. 
---
And I dont think its bloodied builds that made people not want to join. I havent seen a ton of people join for the last 3 times I tried to do the event.. Maybe people just arent interested in it anymore
---
would need to be double damage when you're above 1/2 health, or else it would do insane damage with adrenal , that's the main problem is people using it at stealth with adrenal
---
58 or 59 and pretty burnt out and mostly tired
---
No....
---
Really love taking photos. But tbh I fill up my space and delete the worst of them. This way I always have fresh loading screens. 
---
But I guess it would be possible to use a usb for storage. 
---
Otherwise I sometimes post my best images on Imgur. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 myself so it‚Äôs kinda hideous but hear me out. 
---
-First you download ps messenger app on you phone
---
-Then you go to you PS and send your photos to a mate
---
-Now they will appear on your mobile as well and you can save them wherever. 
---
I know of no better way on PS4 really. But I might be dumd as hell lol. We‚Äôll find out
---
Ah ok thanks man. So its automatically legendary when you craft it?
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah it should cap at 100%
---
Same...only moved mine twice since I crawled out of the vault almost a year ago.
---
As an unyielding bloodied build my carry weight goes from 455 without PA to 345 in excavator.
---
I carry a garbage truck worth of tools and weapons, battle like a delicate little flower that melts everything and only use PA for radiation rumble and colossus
---
I play on xbox 1, so that could be the reason. Feels like the appeal of Encryptid isnt really there for the last few times I've seen it up. Every once in a while I'll see 5 or 6 people, but not often
---
&gt;	And additional question; after NW level 100+, Nuclear Winter is also useless, right?
---
For rewards, yes
---
How do you all edit so well!! Amazing shot
---
Since you use unyielding but aren‚Äôt bloodied, where about do you keep your health?
---
Yeah, people just aren't that interested in encryptid anymore, I've noticed it too
---
The issue isnt bloodied or any of that for PvP itbis how fast can you stack nuka quantums with cola nut. It also dosent matter what players want if a role is necessary people will play it
---
Just play them both all the way up until you HAVE to choose one. Then choose one. Really doesn‚Äôt matter which. Keep all of the gold for yourself, and do your dailies for both factions until you max out your rep.
---
And while you're all gang banging the legendary corpse we just lost two extractors.
---
Run both absolutely as far as you can before making your decision for the most rewards
---
Oh. Didn‚Äôt know that threshold
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hui4kn/bug_atoms_received_by_challenges_arent/
---
This may be the culprit.
---
The rebels
---
Yes. That is why you need to buy legendary modules at 50 scrip per. But it can be anything from a 1 to a 3 star with any combination of effects. You have have plenty of bad rolls to turn back into scrip.
---
That's INSANE, what an amazing shot mate!
---
Fire and poison resistance cards are coming in the legendary perk set
---
There is a powered garage door included.  It just shows shut when it's open.
---
The one I started before this one was just a duo, me and a friend. That's why I couldnt tank pylons this time, I had to tank them during the duo since my friend is bloodied
---
&gt;  Respawn:¬†The respawn option no longer appears on the screen when auto-respawning during A Colossal Problem.
---
What about every single other time I die? Whether I'm in an event or out in the world, if I die I get auto-respawned and the respawn UI appears, I can't move my character, and have to "respawn" by bringing up the map and fast traveling away, complete with fast travel timer and the inability to fast travel while over-encumbered.
---
"Is it worth the grind?"
---
That depends on your grind. I play almost daily. It's the best rated power armor,  stats-wise. Do you want the best? I have it, but I got the SS armour/mods first, as well as all the guns/mods I wanted. Basically I'm still grinding gold and have to spend it on something. I use my Excavator for nuke zone farming and only really use the T-65 for SBQ and Encripted. Btw, I just finished my T-65 yesterday, and I've been grinding since launch. It's tanky for sure.
---
It really doesn't matter. As long as you get to the quest "siding with settlers/raiders" for both factions, you'll have all the "exclusive" items for each faction. 
---
Whoever you side with just gives you a reputation boost, plus an outfit.
---
Thanks for the answer mate! Too bad they removed old system completely! Probably for selling more atom points for real money. Let's try to suggest them to add repeatable system; in Bethesda Forums.
---
I just added everyone that sent me a request I will be on tonight I'll invite you all and leave my world open to all friends
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
Just curious. Is this why no one collects ore in the event? I find myself failing it over and over. Or at least not get much rewarded
---
&gt;I just want to be able to break ammo down back to its components on a workbench (with a small amount of loss which would be understandable).
---
[What an absurd idea, we all know nothing like that would ever be in a Fallout game.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reloading_bench)
---
[removed]
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen them lay in your bed, play your instruments, use your stations and even ride your Mr. fuzzies right
---
That's gone now
---
There was no lag. And even if there had been, so we could get a bit of health down, it would have ended back at full health anyway since the "legendary enemy has mutated" spikes its health back to full.
---
The trick still works, it's just you can't do it before the loading screen anymore.
---
It's fun to play. Even after S.C.O.R.E. integrated to NW, it's more fun! Old daily system only gave Perk Cards for NW.
---
Duplicated Gatling plasmas are for beta boys who can‚Äôt play a game on difficult settings. Prove me wrong.
---
That would be awesome. I‚Äôve just started nuclear winter for the challenges lately and it‚Äôs been lots of fun.
---
I buy atoms in steam myself and I'm usually never below 1000 or so. I never noticed what atoms were missing until I read someone's reddit post who found the issue with the atoms. I checked and had 120 myself. The atoms system is sketch and bugged to hell but at least they aren't lost! Just mismanaged. Glad it worked out.
---
only one can be used for the quest, the game glitches with them and they auto-duplicate. the duplicates are worthless, but can be sold to robot vendors for 1 cap.
---
Oh yeh that‚Äôs another one. Those games have their moments but Fallout is great for chilling out
---
Seems that people just want to farm the exp from the mobs that attack the scavengers instead of collecting the ore. I dont participate in that event much since I dont see many people doing that one either
---
Ooh awesome. On last thing if I may, im trying to decide wether to get this (250g more expensive) or the Chinese stealth armor it looks epic. Def leaning towards the ss armor but do u know uf the Chinese armor has any defense?? Or is it cosmetic
---
It‚Äôs a 1:1 turn in, so unfortunately you can‚Äôt stack a bunch up and turn in back to back
---
Yeah that is an issue, they need to make the health regen much slower for any food items.
---
Most games do this, the fastest healing should be stimpacks or salves.
---
Nuka Cola should be used for ap regeneration not healing forever. (this is what i use it for)
---
I‚Äôve heard people do it at workshops to keep from messing with their camp budget
---
You can also just have fun make a random build and fix your build when you‚Äôre in your 50s lol
---
I‚Äôm a mess and didn‚Äôt get a build going until lvl 70 or so
---
Yah I had gotten 80 of them before I ended the boa quest line so I just sold them all
---
Follow both faction quest paths all the way up till you get the quests titled "Side with Crater/Foundation" before you ultimately choose. This ensures you get the most out of faction rewards. It also helps to get a feel for who you may like or dislike.The general consensus seems to be the Raiders have the more fun questline and depending on choices made during their quest you can gain access to a plasma weapon during the raid. I chose Settlers because of reasons i wont spoil. Aside from some outfits and the plasma weapon all other content will be available after the end regardless of who you choose. My advice would be go with what you feel
---
Happy cake day!
---
I never talked to my ally again after completing their long ass quest lines. Probably should?
---
Weird, it's a really fun event. I'm seeing it like 5 times/week and I always try to attend. My full set of Troubleshooter's BoS is always ready for it lol
---
Oh really? I find it full with people often. But problem is we keep failing. Really wanna get that hazmat suit for my collection. But yeah it seems that everyone is just ‚Äúdefending‚Äù the scavengers lol
---
This is brought up repeatedly.
---
the problem is basicaly server related. The fallout  first scrap box is actualy handled separately From your personal and storage box. Increasing the number of items somehow causes server issues. We have also asked that vendors be separated from your primary storage but supposedly that would actualy make things worse 
---
given that Real MMOs solved the handling inventory management on a truly colossal scale as far back as EvE online only underscores how mind boggling incompetent the devs were when setting it up in this game.
---
What level are you?
---
I think this is a great idea. The more QOL fixes that Bethesda makes, the less tedious the game seems to new players which makes them more likely to stick around
---
you people are tedious with your gimmie gimmie gimmie.
---
Did you do the settler quests til the end before raiding vault79? Specifically the part where you go under the golf course (being vague for others). If so you already know how to craft the stealth armor. The plans are only sold for gold so that people who didn‚Äôt follow the quest line completely can still learn to craft it. 
---
I think SS armor is a better long term goal. I have a set of Chinese stealth armor and I only use it as a hazmat substitute since it was the same rad resistance but actually has some dr. It is not legendary.
---
1. They didn't remove them then because bethesda's ability to actually go through characters or remove/modify items didn't really exist and still barely exists now.  Poor decisions from the beginning of the game shouldn't persist if they reach a point where they can correct them.
---
2. Legacy weapons were removed for a reason.  Bethesda saw the combinations of fire rate, damage, whatever the fuck that could be achieved from energy weapons with the explosive effect and decided they did not like it.
---
3. It doesn't matter if it's something else.  Fuck it's BETTER if it's something else because ANYTHING else wouldn't be a finite commodity.  B2525's may be rare but you can still get them as drops.
---
4. The Bloodied effect isn't unbalanced.  It's a glass cannon build.  The thing that is broken is the amount of damage mitigation people can stack on top of it.
---
5. It doesn't matter if I don't like explosive energy weapons or if someone else likes them.  All that matters is what Bethesda thinks, and they made that fairly clear when they made it so that no more of them could ever enter the game.
---
Just a normal day playing Fallout 76
---
That's the note I had in my original post that got it deleted by mods
---
You can use photo mode to get through the door
---
Super easy, and theres probably a ton of youtube videos on it
---
Yeah I love encryptid, I'm always looking for legendaries to sell/scrip so I can start working on my own build but I feel like I'm just wasting the money making the recall cards since I never see it up/see people doing it when its started
---
Thats what is cause imbalance arm not the prefixes
---
I bought one off a player vendor recently
---
Don't think so. There are few characters in Fallout's history that I've wanted to kill more. I believe this was their intention.
---
I see people go to it on occasion but never to collect the ore, just to farm the mobs. I play console, so I dont really see anyone doing ANY event honestly. It depends on the server though, sometimes you get lucky with event runners and sometimes you dont
---
Yea I sided with the raiders so im having to pay 4k for it. Tbh ill prolly just get the ss. Thanks!
---
New players are going to get legendary perks?
---
Power armor glitch, too.
---
Exactly...thr XP from mobs isn't worth my ammo
---
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, just passing along a tip dude that is all. The imposter can be one shot with the right setup. Seen it done, and seen it done spawning in before pylons can be active. 
---
Guess what I‚Äôm trying to say the other lv300 dude could been clueless or could be trying new tactic u never know
---
I kind of hope we get to see the compound Eugenie's from at some point.
---
One thing I've considered doing is swapping out traveling pharmacy or strong back for ranks in Blocker, but I'm not sure of the utility there.
---
No problem. Btw if you do another toon, level both settlers and raiders to the point where you raid vault79. Then and only then choose a side. This will maximize your rewards and rep.
---
I see. Too bad game has sucky servers cus this would be a great addition.
---
Only lay in bed, since I put one right by their spawns.
---
Heres a picture for better reference. 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/jRdB92J
---
I'm glad it worked out too. Don't get me wrong, this game is by far my favorite fallout game. I really do genuinely love it. It is just so frustrating how buggy it can be. I really wish Bethesda was better at bug fixing and quality control. Thank you for the help
---
You‚Äôll most likely have all the cards by the time you reach 100 though so those perk packs are useless
---
Put a post on the LFG (Looking for Group), you'll have no shortage of players after posting as long as the world isn't full. I post as well as look for other postings.
---
I mean what else would we want the noobs around for lol?
---
Yeah you‚Äôll prolly see them do it eventually... you probably don‚Äôt hang out in ur camp the entire time your logged in either ü§£ü§£
---
That's one hell of a picture!
---
Same I'm having a blast and have been since beta. I don't really pay attention to the noise I just find my own happiness in it. But we have tolerated a lot of bugs. You have to truly love this game to deal with the mountain of issues.
---
Yup I only noticed when another player started making question mark signs in front of my vendor, then I checked map and my vendor logo was gone. Happened less than 24 hours ago
---
Just go to camp venture and sometimes it pops back up
---
I guess I dont see it as a tip considering it's a lag based thing, and not something that can be forced to happen.
---
And if he was clueless, that's no big deal. Not blaming him for not knowing, there was a time where I didnt know either. I did let him know over chat that it wasnt taking damage while invisible and he seemed to stop attacking it after that, so maybe he just didnt know.
---
If they rank up enough they can just like anyone else
---
I wish there was an option to hug them.
---
No, they're worth saving for when additional challenge cosmetics are added, any duplicate perks = experience which will fill out the challenges quickly and take less matches to complete them.

I think you're suggesting it's useful in some RP-corner meta. I'm talking actual numbers, like player vs player. What kills the quickest / keeps you alive the longest. This is why we see so many people running around in halloween costumes, or whatever the latest kiddie crazed garbage in the atom shop or event reward mask is... you just have more / better damage mitigation options not wearing power armor. Granted, heavy guns in PvE is amazeballs and effective, but that's because pve is easy. I can put together any cheese build and so long as your weapons decent you won't break a sweat. But if I were to actually fight that kid in PvP he'd stomp my lights out. Unless I get out of the power armor and don legendary heavy / sturdy whatever armor. It's a sad state of affairs in a world where lore wise power armor was of the highest prestige. It was the holy grail in black isles Fallout 1, 2, Tactics etc.. it was on all the box art, the face of the Enclave and used in all the marketing material. Bethesda still uses it to market. But it's garbage in this game unless you like to RP.
---
I got the ss one and I'm not really a fan it's to big a bulky and the leaves on the left shoulder come into your screen in 1st person so now I'm having to play NW against my will to get the outfit
---
Well if they are hitting, with crackly weapons or not, they are hurting/killing them so I think they are in fact contributing? Crackly weapons has inherit stagger effect so they actually slow the mobs down. So I don‚Äôt understand why OP said everyone else was ‚Äòreally trying to fight things‚Äô but not those players who were using crackly weapons and sent ghouls flying.
---
Meh new season starts soon after. Not everyone is close to 100.
---
If Im on a server where decent numbers of people are participating in events ive been running Encryptid (PS4). i needed to burn some caps and its a nice xp earner as well as a chance at the good rewards. I dont ever run it though unless Im prepared to take pylons. Sometimes I get stuck with all 3 which is a pain in the arse but what can ya do. The one thing I am loving with the public teams is if one of your team mates lands a shot and you dont you can still loot after so i dont mind taking pylons so much
---
So nothing out of the ordinary really.
---
I dont usually LFG it because I dont use my recall cards often. Just trying to get the weekly score mission done this time around, but I'll just join the events that spawn regularly. Hopefully the event appeal will go back up, I'd hate to see the game just become the same old legendary route and scrap routes. I like the grind, but with the limited stash space itll just become a hassle
---
Make sure you don‚Äôt have any of them in your inventory, head to Whitesprings bunker. Start making your way towards the Armory, That last area that you‚Äôre in before you head up the last flight of stairs look to your left. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúcommand center‚Äù Looking area with a bunch of desks, not sure what the area is called but anyway those desks, start walking by then and checking them. They usually have technical data. Check all the desks, there‚Äôs sometimes three or four in there. But only pick up one and the quest should activate as long as you don‚Äôt have any in your inventory. But take note if there are any more in any other desks, go turn in the first one you picked up. Head back to Whitesprings bunker and repeat
---
It‚Äôs a repeatable quest, so you could technically do it 24 hours straight I guess
---
I mean if its just a wondering around doin' stuff build it looks fine. I see you go for sneak 3, worth pointing out you won't notice the damage loss if you drop a pt of adrenaline for escape artist.
---
Do you also really need packrat 3? When was the last time you filled your inventory with junk? I'd run packrat 1 or even 0 and then you can have your blocker and whatever else!
---
The only good use for NW is to get the glitched rewards and then dump it. Finally got that jacket last night and said never more.
---
"Swooping is...bad..." But seriously, this is an awesome shot, I love the lazers behind her.
---
not really leaked since they are on the Public test server. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
but from what i have seen there are a Colossus taxidermy, a stuffed Colossus toy, a Colossus 
---
rug, the 3 cursed weapons and some other stuff i cannot remember
---
Literally nothing is different in the world or story, it affects nothing so follow your heart
---
I'm on PC btw. I see a lot of new players here and there but also high levels that like to do Encryptid, Project Paradise and Rad Rumble. Rarely I find myself on an empty server. Although it seems like everybody is expecting for others to go first and then they hop in. I've started Rad Rumble with just seconds left
---
Seems interesting im a ps4 player so we dont get to see the pts
---
U can turn them in back to back, as long as you do it one at a time
---
Seems like you were hoping this game would play like a single player fo5. You‚Äôre always going to have trouble with carry weight and stash limit with this build because there‚Äôs a lot of guns. Also you won‚Äôt be able carry your weight during end game battles. I‚Äôd recommend making 5 characters for different builds.
---
Why would they wait for you tho? they get nothing out of that.
---
you can be sure I will kill him fast if I meet you
---
For this cause I would have preferred no repairing kits in this game.
---
Yeah they give you ally missions every day and a lot of the time you retrieve a weapon case and get a legendary weapon. Also get some script for it I believe.
---
I know, yet Bethesda knew there would be loyal players which'll end sooner. So it's good to have something to grind; 50K S.C.O.R.E. = 50 Atom Points seems fine, yet if there would be any glitch (there was..) it would be game breaker for Atom Shop economy. At least they could gave us back daily atom grind, after finishing season. I'm thinking if it was for more milking money or stability issues, yet even they just fixed completition bug.
---
Yeah before they implemented global matchmaking it wasn't an issue for me. I would get the "Waiting for other players" on the load screen. After they changed matchmaking my load times are a good 10-20secs longer and I don't get that message anymore. So I assume I'm one the last to load in. If a teammate has team chat on, I can hear them playing for 10-15 seconds and I'm just sitting there staring at a loading screen.
---
I'll load in sometimes and 4-5 people have already been killed and obviously if I load in near people, all the boxes will have been looted and I'm screwed and have to run off into the bushes. Puts me at a huge disadvantage for the whole match.
---
Dam can you say screen saver ant quick. Props human nice shot
---
Is this game really the only time you have issues? You can spend a lot of time looking for problems or you can wipe and install fresh.
---
At least they did increase it was the original 400
---
the one you like best, ideally after doing all quests leading up to the actual raid.
---
shit is it only that much? I better check when I get on later how far away I am from that. I have no idea what I want to spend it on next. The armor I guess even though Im kinda happy with what im using
---
What are the cursed weapons
---
Full when I am using stealth suit. Nerd rage level when I'm wearing unyielding as usually that means I'm farming so I want the int/xp. But generally I just wear the stealth suit or PA and run full health. It's fun to fill fairly unkillable.
---
Can't like this comment enough. Hopefully this is a sign the'll give us PA users a little push forward now.
---
Yes it's the only game. If it starts to happen elsewhere maybe I will take your advice.
---
How often will this bring stuff back to my camp?
---
As much as this sucks from a higher level player I enjoy helping the new guys out. Some of these folks are huge fallout fans that didn‚Äôt wanna buy the game
---
It's weird. It follows a bunch of different story lines, you can never be sure which one is the main one.
---
I would like to know also
---
For some reason my game wont save pictures I've taken in photo mode. Anyone know why?
---
My whole problem with The Brotherhood even being in this game is that at this point in the lore they were hardly more than a small tribe surviving at Lost Hills. Bethesda twisted the lore in order to shoehorn the Brotherhood into this game. The new dlc should absolutely not have members of the brotherhood traveling from Lost Hills to Appalachia. Unfortunately this cat is long out of the bag and now we get to deal with a huge retcon of Brotherhood history.
---
some people really need to read the "how to do the event" things on loading screens when fast travelling.
---
How can I get the insult bot to appear?
---
I know I remember that in beta and right after beta.
---
Listen here you toe eyed punk. We need more players.
---
Does it register you tagging it while it‚Äôs invincible? I‚Äôm always having to be a conduit for the event. If I‚Äôm gonna blow through 20 stimpacks and all my nuka quantum I better get that prized one star  tire iron. If I can register a tag then grab a pylon and hide somewhere that would make my life easier.

Countless times I took all three pylons and run around spamming stims. When I see the Imposter has aggro on another player I go from behind and throw half napalm tank on it to secure the loot. Rinse and repeat.
---
yes, i apply the same technique lol
---
I remember leveling with a bloodied build at lvl 23. It was 1hit K.O. for me or the ghouls ü§™
---
Picking up more than one technical data is pointless though, only the first one picked up can be used.  All you can do with extras is sell them to a vendor bot for 1 cap.
---
I'm sorry, but where exactly are you getting all your info on the percentage of people who play this game who are deaf or hard of hearing? Do you have some behind the scenes numbers from some poll as to how many are? No? Then just stop. The positive energy coming to this post shows just how many people there actually could be who need these subtitles. Just because you don't know any doesn't mean there aren't a lot out there playing this game.
---
When being a bloodied build you should always prepare yourself you‚Äôll be dying a lot
---
I had a level 300+ doing this too. But he was bloodied and seemed to die every time that I had all 3 pylons on myself. It was just him and I and we ended up losing because he would spray into the assaultron while it was invisible and I got very frustrated
---
It's pretty often, if you don't go to your camp the 10 pound limit will fill up with booze bottles before you know it and it will stop bringing in new stuff. You need to go back and empty it out every so often.
---
I  prefer uranium fever solo. Or a least my actual friends who well let me get a shot in on the legendaries
---
Fortunately, my character's lore fits a poorly made camp. She's living in an abandoned train car, using a garage to fix her stuff. She's kind of a drifter, anyway. She was a soldier who struggled after her discharge, and became a thief until the bombs fell and her family died. Now she is using her skills with a rifle and stealth to try and set things as right as she can, but she never felt comfortable at home, and enjoys living in an ersatz house.
---
the side you dont do the actual raid with will love you again after a few dailies. hell, you can screw over the side you DO do the raid with and keep all the gold to yourself, and they'll love you after a few dailies.
---
do both questlines all the way, pick the one whos characters you like best for the raid, and then just work them both till they're at Ally rank.
---
I save them and leave them as gifts in camps I visit to shop.
---
I‚Äôve tried that, doesn‚Äôt work. You need to get the quest from picking it up.
---
I'd love to try a bloodied build. Looks fun and dangerous baby.. I like it.
---
Not really tho but I'm also in power armor the only time I have trouble is extreme rads and poison damage
---
It doesn't work for me :( the option isn't there
---
I put in a ticket and never even heard back. I'm ''temporarily suspended' whatever TF that actually means is beyond me. They haven't responded in any way at all. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant, I explained the entire process in a reply to the OP. When I read what you said I was thinking that you were under the assumption that you can only do one a day or something
---
Thanks for the quick response, I think I might buy it
---
That's how I was feeling, but if they dont know I cant be angry with them. I got the exp from the other enemies there so in the end I guess it was fine, but there went the 2000+ caps I spent to get the mats for that card.
---
Make sure to include the train station and the road in front of the train station. There are lots of pods and sap in that area
---
&gt;I'm talking actual numbers, like player vs player. What kills the quickest / keeps you alive the longest.
---
Yeah, it will give me near god mode, dont see how that doesnt "keep you alive longest"
---
As far as pvp goes, who cares?  Pvp players are extremly few and far between and requires no skill at all if you follow the meta.  It is even easier than pve lmao.  Game balance should __never__ be balanced around a tiny niche
---
As far as defence, there is no other armor in game that can have a gaurenteed 90% redux from all sources
---
Most people run around without PA, because most people dont run heavy guns.  Virtually every HG user i see runs around in PA
---
Yes!!!!  Watch the angry turtle video on full health pa.   It took me to school.  He explans it all.  Pretty much kills 50 plus supermutants and 10 plus scorch beasts and his health went down maybe 40 percent.
---
Hot radiation bath
---
I was totally against it until I got that sledge hammer then I figured I'd try it and I'm lvl 128 and this is the most fun I've had in this game
---
could you post that link please
---
You sound like you play the mode more than I do, so I'll defer to you on it. I didn't know there was any predictable nature to the crates. I kept choosing this one spot where an epic crate seemed like it would spawn every time.. and then once it wasn't and I was pretty screwed because apparently one did spawn at the other nearby spot because I got gauss shotgunned about a minute later.
---
I love how you have so much information on the number of deaf or hard of hearing people that play this game... oh wait, you are just assuming because you don't know anyone who does that it must not be very many? I'm betting there are actually a lot! The POSITIVE feedback to this post is proof of that.
---
Link me build? And what weapons / armor?
---
Literally my exact situation. Haven't heard anything since the temp suspension email. Hopefully it means we're not being banned, but there's no way of actually knowing anything until they respond. It's quite frustrating.
---
You have been banned
---
There is no possum backpack. Possum badges exchange for backpack mods.  Go visit the possum machine to see the options
---
Unfortunately for all other builds, once you get the correct setup and perks, it's not difficult at all to be bloodied. It's ridiculously easy. I perhaps die like 3 times a week, usually to acid/poision damage, but sometimes assaultrons, or me not reequipping cards after crafting :D
---
Getting the setup, armour, cards and mutations etc can take a while, but otherwise...
---
I shall however once again turn this into a "bloodied doesn't need nerfing, the rest of the classes need balancing/adding to to compete with it" post. The synergy of the build is amazing when it's finished. Other builds and loadouts should offer similar gratification.
---
Sniffing the pipe heals you for 4 HP &gt;1 min!
---
It‚Äôs slated to come later this year.
---
Best bet is to pay attention to the name and try to send a DM. Sometimes it works. But yea frustrating
---
That's not the way it used to be, and it would be fucking nice if Bethesda said if it's a bug or a feature.
---
Most events are so much better solo, definitely uranium fever, one violent night, awol armaments, line in the sand, even riding shotgun and hordes etc.  you can control the pace and really milk the XP and legendaries.
---
Let me look up the new list give me a min
---
Finding the weapon of your dreams on the wrong toon that‚Äôs down on caps and not being able to refind the vendor with a loaded toon
---
I wish we could make them all in game
---
It‚Äôs been that way for a long time.
---
I don‚Äôt much care for -anything- that spawns in The Mire.
---
A lot of trash in vendors but I did manage to pick up a forest camo jumpsuit for 50 caps from one of them
---
Agreed!  I originally put my camp just south of V76 so players could fast travel to it to shop with ease, but more recently it‚Äôs seeing traffic from new players. 
---
I‚Äôve unlocked my Collectron station and added two more purifiers. Also Try to keep a supply of inert flux and diluted stims for cheap. Sucks when high level players buy me out to take advantage, but too easy to just replace.
---
I'd recommend it for sure. The chems weigh very little and sell for good money to vendors. Some of them like berry mentats are also real useful for the INT boost for extra XP and bufftats for when you need a quick carry weight boost if over encumbered. The booze will also cover what Biv asks for 9 times out of 10 for his daily.
---
I was just in a match and a team mate, with mic on, was broadcasting ZAX‚Äôs opening round spiel whilst I was still in a loading screen. Makes you wonder.
---
Assassins sentinels gear are some of the [rarest and most expensive rolls](https://imgur.com/a/D2AE9He) in the game along with cavaliers. You can get pa for free starting at level 25. Secret service also requires a significant grind via wastelanders whereas power armor jetpacks require some flux and queen fights that you can do at 50. 
---
Sure you can outpower the pa, but its not as easy as you make it sound and those issues are because of the combat/damage system both of which require serious overhauls and even then, its not that bad.
---
Also what about heavy guns?
---
r/thathappened
---
Edit: Apparently it did. I stand humbled.
---
Yeah
---
I haven't even been able to open the game, I would have had no way to be banned.
---
Oh that‚Äôs worth bothering. Is it full legendary table, like including fixers et al or just normal?
---
You‚Äôve become the very thing you swore to destroy.
---
https://aridenkane.com/fallout-76-legendary-perk-cards-complete-list-and-details/
---
Yeah i know. It was another random change with no explanation or patch notes. We're left wondering if it was intentional or not.
---
50k s.c.o.r.e for .50 cents worth of atoms. What a waste  of time that would be.
---
[Solo Encryptid ](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs)
---
Yes, it did.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. I regularly go thru the game photos and screen shot them. Then using the Xbox app I save them to my phone photo album which is cloud storage. I also have a digital picture frame in my game room and it‚Äôs got close to 1000 screen grabs at this point. Some of the launch-era photos and strange graphic glitches feel like a lifetime ago.
---
Is your friend talking about the small backpack vs the standard backpack?
---
Nah. It‚Äôs worse when someone buys that weapon and I get no caps.
---
I completely agree bloodied doesn't need nerfing it's high risk high reward I was just amazed how fun it can be like I have to keep a eye on my health and rads in the middle of almost every fight but ig I like the added challenge of it
---
When i first started NW for the survivor stuff there had been some earlier bug that had resulted in rewarding perk packs when it wasnt meant to and I had some stupid number ( a couple of hundred I think) perk packs to open. I think i ended up unlocking some of the content just on opening packs lol
---
Do you still have any I would be interested in buying some need a bunch for me and my wife we just started doing the challenges
---
Those little guys are tanky and hard to shoot for a reason.
---
It‚Äôs intentional, otherwise you could hoard them and turning them in would be a joke to farm all the rare plans.
---
Aaaaand I had my pants pulled down.
---
Touch√©.
---
I had 130 perk packs on the character I created for wastelanders that I used to unlock the survivor stuff quickly.
---
Could i get one that says im sorry i fogot to opt. out of teams.  Im gonna shoot 3 bloatflies then run into the fire?
---
So, the "possum backpack" is just a skin that costs 3 badges. üòØ The tadpole backpack should give you a carry weight bonus of 60lbs, at max level. There are possum backpack mods that you can alter the tadpole pack with, High capacity +120 carry weight, -60DR and 60ER, lead lined +90RR but only +30 carry weight, insulated +90ER again only +30 carry weight, Refridgerated, and a few others. Now with settlers and raiders, they add 2 new mods, chemist pack and grocer's pack. Chemist reduces all chem weight by 90%, effectively freeing up the traveling pharmacist perk rank 3. Grocer's pack reduces all food and drink by 90% freeing up the Thru Hiker perk rank 3. Hope this helps!
---
It's almost like they're new to the game and have no idea what sells or what to price things as. 
---
HMMMMMMMMM! I wonder why that is. 
---
Also. I have seen so many high level player vendors that are completely out of touch with reality.
---
She has. I‚Äôve grown to like her anyway. I had no idea her quest line would go on for so long.
---
nice one
---
You're actually right, something around 10K would be near to season's 150 rewards and make more sense.
---
That aged well...
---
That would be worse than the rate you earn now via scrapping perks so no thanks.  im fine with removal of scrapping perks in favor of just granting coins as you level,  but at the least it needs to be 1.8 per lvl (the current rate) if not vastly more. 
---
4 or 5 coins per level would be reasonable and still require many hundreds of lvls to max all 6 slots.
---
I love the story, nice fit it's quite rare for me to come across traverse people. It's quite nice as well. I love it
---
Yup, part of the fun for me initially was that it was such a high risk/reward. 
---
One could argue that now with the huge synergy of cards armour mutations etc, that aspect is gone and it's just all power with no drawbacks, but it takes a while to get to that point for sure, especially if you're not an experienced player just on an alt. 
---
I  feel rather than the build being overpowered (which I guess technically it is) the other builds need things to make them as viable/interesting. Right now the only payoff in end game is that feeling of power and invulnerability. 
---
That can be combatted with more and harder enemies, as well as changing other builds and with more content (which is coming granted). 
---
Have fun with it though I say, it's hilariously fun at times, even the rando deaths that catch you out- like face tanking the SBQ melee attacks 5 times in a row, but dying to a cave cricket instantly :D
---
I have 18k saved from 1st and lack of actual content in stom shop but they would get crucified even more than normal if thaybwas the ratio.
---
Build for what? 90% redux? Pa 40% standard + 50% EP
---
Pvp meta build? Google/nukes and dragons it,  no point in them since they are dead builds anyway since nobody pvps
---
My build/gear? Its in my comments probably a few months back by now
---
Also why would i bother linking to someone who didnt even know rad resist # is a useless stat for them to "judge/math" a build? (As seen in OP)
---
Yes.  It's amazing.  Slap a Core Assembly on the torso and 2 or 3 in Action Boy/Girl and you'll have pretty consistent 30% damage reduction.  I also highly recommend 3 in Ricochet (luck).
---
Get some toxic goo from Wes Tek ü§†üôÉüôÇ ahh lost my hat.üòë
---
Then maybe 2 points per level to make up for the 5 extra cards every 5 levels.  I‚Äôll make the change
---
there are 3 cursed weapons, harpoon gun, pickaxe and a shovel, they have an un-removable mod that makes them cursed, increased damage with lower durability.
---
Wait I thought you couldn't do dailies anymore of that group if you didn't choose them for the raid.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna bring up the meme prices again. I swear.
---
Is your uncle a dev?
---
I'd say max ammo factory is a 1st for every player, then rank 1 of master of master infiltration do not max out till u max other cards, followed by follow thru for sneak builds, if not sneak anti venom, then power armor reboot 4 heavy builds, and then maybe what's rads if your the type of person that has issues with rads. But these are just my opions
---
Ok....put him on the list boyz.
---
Happened to me last week, thought somebody had destroyed my base but everything was fine!
---
It pissed me off as I literally just moved and set everything up the previous day, only to have to re-list everything AGAIN! -\_-
---
But if you get it in the mission you have the plan.
---
This üôå I can't believe the whinning, complaining, and bitching of all these players because they don't get a godroll and they have to actually work to get something decent on the game. I'm like you, I started with a bloodied explosive handmade, and traded and traded and traded to get good stuff. I got a few rare outfits and traded everything for 2 legacys. Then I traded one of those for more good stuff I don't get why players don't understand thats how you get good stuff in this game. It's not about caps, or presents or anything else, you trade to move up the pyramid.
---
Marine tactical helmet is a good sell, 3 rubber 1 plastic(i think) and 1 glass. Sells for 31 with hard bargin and grape mentants. It has a lot of spawn locations so should be easy to get (if you dont pick up plans and switch servers it could be a different plan)
---
Dedicated servers... If you have a fallout 1st membership you should always load in 1st haha
---
How much does 44k steel weigh? Asking for a friend.
---
Well the script definitely exists in English but the English subtitles don't work.
---
*the... the... the...*
---
#THE GRINCH!
---
Idk your exact build but you can build in more defense using barbarian and evasive and maxing both stats, blocker for melee dmg, and serendipity which triggers a lot for me. Supresser is a good idea if your fighting a tanky opponent such as the SBQ, but you probably cant fit that in if your running 9 points of slugger but switching to a punching weapon would free up some STR perk spots while still enabling you to Instakill 99% of the radiated rascals out there.
---
Ensure you pick up some of those juicy mutations if you ever plan on dedicating to it and grab radicool.  Naturally with all these things you would have to ditch the PA and go for a set up unyielding.
---
I can tank damage pretty well with this.
---
Really? It‚Äôs just a paint scheme right, like the father winter (which I think is still bugged)
---
Why would you get a rule 10 infraction for that?
---
I have grown to love NW. I love dying very fast after completing my objective.
---
Awww look to them they think they're people jk ;P
---
Maxson seceded from the union 3 days before the bombs fell. He didn‚Äôt form the Brotherhood until after the unit moved from Mariposa to Lost Hills. He formed the Brotherhood as a way to give the surviving members of his unit a purpose going forward after the war. In Fallout 2, you come across a lone member of the Brotherhood who gives you a mission to steal vertibird plans from the Enclave at the Navarro base.
---
Rule 10 is for trading posts, or retired posts added to the Bethesda Plz page  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz)
---
Real MMOs were generally designed from the ground up to be MMOs. Fallout 76 is an engine tooled for single player retrofitted into a client/server setup, with more of an eye to getting it functional than building it well. All of the dupe and weapon hack exploits in Fallout 76 would be impossible in a real MMO, because sensibly designed network applications don't trust the client for much more than rendering and sending commands.
---
Yeah i cant remember the exact number I had waiting for me but I know it was more than 100. It was such a great help. Im wishing I had that boost again now since I'm currently on the final long stretch to get the Winter Coat. Its the last thing i have left to unlock but as a bush wookie i think it will take me all of the remaining time to get it before its patched out
---
No the post (from another user bringing up camp ideas for mannequins) I commented on was taken down on rule 10
---
And A Real Blast. Until the end, where you have to clear the stragglers, you can pure stealth your way through.
---
I mostly like the way the CSA looks, I just wish there was a skin that got rid of the red glowy bits and the orange facemask (the marine tactical helmet looks okay, but there's a bare spot at the neck that I can't unsee)
---
Adding black paint for the Pip Boy and the clandestine backpack skin makes for a pretty good outfit, IMO.
---
The DR/ER is pretty low (140/140) but with five ranks of Ironclad and Scaly Skin, that jumps up to a respectable 240/240/1kRR.
---
It also reduces fall damage by probably 90%, which is good for if you gotta make a fast getaway. 
---
I've died multiple times because I forgot to put it back on and took a leap.
---
Ok that was always allowed.
---
If you think nerfing bloodied and junkies is going to stop people from one shotting legendaries, I got some nice swamp land for sale and a cool looking bridge.
---
I love Surface to Air, but there is one that now has spawned insane bots with it. I can‚Äôt fight off a Scorchbeast, mind the artillery, AND fight these bots.
---
Have you talked to the Overseer at her home in Sutton?
---
Stunning. Revelatory. This idea has not only never been suggested, it's never been thought of by anyone, ever. OP, a god among redditors.

And the original post I had commented on with adding ideas for new camp ideas was taken down for rule 10

My camp may not be the prettiest but I feel the same way about having someone explore around it. As a reward for people who don't just shop and leave right away I have an unpowered vendor hidden upstairs that has stuff for 1 cap in it. So far no one has even cleared it out, either.
---
Apparently they are applying to the non steam version of your account. Not sure how you check as I‚Äôm on console.
---
I bet they're losing sleep.
---
With the right setup you can run bloodied and rarely die.
---
Honestly I never use PA and I never made it so I could be totally wrong.
---
Being disconnected right after killing the Legendary Scorchbeast but before getting any loot.
---
Aries is the best
---
I'm a melee power armor and heavy gun build and you have some very good ideas I will try
---
Yep all legendary weapons, can be 1-3 stars. I got a two shot / 50 vats lever action the other day.
---
I wish this would mean the devs go into overdrive to provide content but I can keep dreaming
---
Well I‚Äôm so glad someone finally did, and so happy that no sarcastic ass hats are wasting time commenting on here a heads up, not everyone lives on Reddit
---
Even better is finding the legendary weapon, about to buy...then look at the level and see it's not max level and the normal max lvl version would do more damage than the low-level legendary
---
if any of those ideas where on that page, that would explain it.
---
Then why let you pick up multiples? It's broken. Make them individual and not stack, or stop people from picking up more. It wasn't easy to unlock the plans before, my level 160 character only ever got 1 paint plan.
---
Thanks, me too.
---
What trick? Is it pc only?
---
Noice. The lever is my favorite. The only gun I have with a skin I paid for.
---
Maybe he thought you were picking on a low level player and decided to teach you a lesson?
---
Did you talk to the level 15 first and explain to him how it worked and how he would be better off storing his stuff than dying or did you just shoot him?
---
I have had this happen a few times to myself. I always go to my camp before logging. If aomeone is there I just chill till they are done shopping.
---
Did you get flagged, cause that sounds like what happened? You killed the lvl 15 and he killed you. Pvp is part of the game. Chances are he a normal kid just like you and not being toxic. So put your big boy pants on and move on, it's just a game.
---
Yea it was as another mannequin request
---
You mean I should be able to change the character I named cap(expletive)er? That‚Äôs blasphemy!
---
I would love the option to rename my character. I created him during the beta and literally named him "Beta" because I was eager to test the performance on my old rig and figured I'd just start from scratch with a new character. Almost two years later, I'm still using "Beta" as my main.
---
No I haven‚Äôt. I go try that. Thanks!
---
Lifegiver is nice and Lone Wanderer if you're a solo player.  The Adrenal Reaction mutation synergizes perfectly with bloodied builds, so I'd also say Starched Genes and maybe Class Freak.
---
Care to link this setup? I‚Äôm still working out a loadout, just an experiment character.
---
Thanks. I will not be emptying mine.

No green stuff here. (Because it's all in the hot tub)
---
One of my teammates loads in a full 10 to 15 secs before the rest of us. He is , One of the Chosen.
---
Is this a pc problem or is it on consoles as well
---
Need rage, dodgey, serendipity (doesn‚Äôt work in power armor), refractor (bullet reflecting perk, forgot the exact name), life giver (paired with speed demon, you regen health in combat when sprinting), and radicool (if you‚Äôre melee, otherwise extra carry weight when paired with rads). Other than that, the rest should just be focused on whatever build you like or whatever bloody weapon you have.
---
I wish I could get this but I doubt you‚Äôre on PS4 or that 76 has cross play
---
That‚Äôs your choice just don‚Äôt complain about not getting the points from them, to be honest it‚Äôs not hard to earn the 30k XP in adventure mode to make up for the loss anyway.
---
I don‚Äôt really like NW either I just play it to slowly get some of the unlocks.
---
Nope. Who you side with has no effect on gameplay only on the final mission
---
While we are throwing out Fallout Robo-Pals, why not FISTO?

I want one for "don't touch my tuba, that's only for decoration, this is the worst wind instrument, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"
---
But he's got it so he might as well use it
---
BEEFY BOYES!
---
I use to AFK on my roof playing a tuba....just to make someone smile.
---
I went to someone‚Äôs camp the other day and they were selling 8 for 100c and that was a steal. Honestly 100c would be way to cheap.
---
Sorry about the situation, but the level 300 parts pretty funny not sure how theres so many high levels that dont know how to do things
---
Anti venom and fur lining have been renamed and apply to power armor aswell now. Its on beths forum.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/419660/what-s-new-in-the-pts-july-16-2020?language%5B%5D=en
---
Yeah you can still damage it while invincible just doesn't do much damage at all.
---
There's a fire pit and chair at my camp that spawns a random settler 90% of the time I load in. I put a couple instruments around the fire and would often get home and see Beckett and the random settler jamming out together. A child weeks ago I put down a third instrument and came home to see a traveling merchant playing with them as well.
---
I didnt even know this was going to be a thing. Thanks mate.
---
It‚Äôs legit on the roadmap
---
As for SCORE: Yeah, totally useless. It still pops and all that, the bar just doesn‚Äôt move and you get nothing. 
---
On NW: Final reward is at 100, but there are some lore unlocks in Vault 51 beyond that, if they interest you. Those aside, you do still complete challenges and get perk cards, so still not entirely useless. Just mostly.
---
Sadly no, Xbox only üòï
---
For you maybe. Not hard, just time consuming doing it one at a time and annoying for melee builds.
---
Fur lining not to appealing to me seeing theres not to many fire related enemies, but the anti venom or whatever it's called seems nice
---
Yeah I loot everything then drop the stuff I don't want so other players can grab it.
---
How is that your fault?
---
All of the Cryptid Holotapes don't have subtitles. I'm not hard of hearing but I have ADHD which makes it difficult to focus on dialogue when other sounds are going off.
---
I'm submitting a ticket as well.
---
Currently 3 hours in just trying to get a single kill. The worst part is that ‚Äúparticipating‚Äù in one doesn‚Äôt even count - you have to land the killing shot on a downed player. Ridiculous for those who cannot PvP.
---
I‚Äôve been bloodied for about two-three weeks now it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt high risk at all and there‚Äôs so little punishment in this game for dying.
---
What chair is that and I've seen the merchant at someone else's camp before. Wasn't sure where he came from.
---
Oh yes, largely because of still unfixed errors that can write off your whole camp if you get too ambitious. I built a few since the beta, but my last was months ago, and barring an overhaul of the camp system I‚Äôm keeping that one indefinitely.
---
I love it too, I have a little dinner setup to the red rocket megastop, swing by if you're on the xbox. Just up the road from Freddie's. Feel free to hang out and use my garage. Gt is Docpineapple114
---
Interesting. Lots of QoL stuff. I wonder how I‚Äôll be sitting at lvl 150 as far as perk coins
---
I never even got that mask....
---
Sopose to be coming in patch 21 but from what I heard they have been pushing it back for awhile, if a long time player can comment on how long these have been a thing of discussion it would be nice info
---
Yea calling it funky duds now I guess. Poison is PA's biggeat downfall, so it will help PA users a ton. Mirelurk kings and queens begone.
---
They are just way overpowered and imo the low health means little unless you get hit by a truck which is very rare in this.
---
Bloodied, zealots, AA etc. all have the same amount of freeze effect on the queen, while the done damage varies. 
---
As mentioned by others the cryolator will not take down the queen but is meant to make it easier to slow her down once she is on the ground- ideally for the melee players to get some quality whacks in.
---
Truth but deff going for the ammo factory first then anti venom
---
I don‚Äôt spend much time on the fo76 feed so I don‚Äôt really care, but yea I can see how people who read it everyday could be annoyed, like chat roulette gotta flip through all the mannequins first

Would get abused by hackers and glitches to farm mass amounts of atoms never going to happen until they fix that.
---
Hmmmm ok

Well, I heard from one of my friends that his associate was perma-banned shortly after sending an appeal. As for myself, I have evidence to prove that some of my friends, along with myself, weren't duping but instead were trading. It started roughly a month ago, after I report a weapon losing glitch that destroyed my bloodied-explosive lever action to support. I was told that they would send someone to give me "something similar" as a replacement. Sadly, the glitch affected me again and took away my anti armor-explosive plasma gatling. I reported it to support that the glitch affected me a second time and they said "due to limiting tools, we are unable to replace in-game items but feel free to keep reporting glitches to help improve the game" and never helped me. So I told my friends about it and shared the screenshots I took, they got pissed about it and said they'd have my back, thus we formed a trading group and over the course of time, acquired really good stuff through various trades and rare encounters with people who were either quieting the game or hadn't played for a long time and didn't realize that certain weapons had become legacies (like this one 15 year old who sold his quad explosive harpoon to me or this other guy who sold his quad-explosive lever action for dirt cheap (I felt bad for him so I gave him my anti-explosive lever for free)). 
---
Unfortunately, due to Bethesda's slow response to the duping exploit, a lot of duped items flooded player vendors and non-duped player trades were virtually impossible. Long story short, most of us got suspended and only I got a reply from Bethesda that merely stated that their system thinks that I duped and that my appeal was denied after a "thorough investigation" and to wait until the rest of the investigation is complete. Which is even more messed up because I think I still have some of the vids I recorded of myself doing some of these trades (due to paranoia of someone running off with my shit) yet it seems their automated messaging system isn't letting me submit the vids so I went on twitter earlier today and asked customer support what I should do and they replied " Just reply to your email, you don't need to make a new ticket"
---
Heavies and melee/unarmed right now.
---
Likewise, for the kill a player today I intentionally spawned in a popular location and killed the first person i saw (which is very easy to do if you don't care about surviving afterwards) -  i then did a robot dance for about half a second as their teammates destroyed me xD
---
Must really piss off the people who enjoy NW having all these idiots showing up just for the score challenges.
---
I feel like I just found the Joker to my Batman.
---
did you shoot the level 260?  because from my experience with it the patch notes hold true.  best i can advise is to just watch your fire especially with an exploding weapon

Kinda figured that would be how you would answer. 
---
Thanks for just restating what you already did in the main body. Choosing to ignore the main point of what I said and reiterating what you already said does not make your argument stronger. Legacies do not ruin your game anymore than a B2525 Fixer/HM or any weapon to someone who builds for that weapon. You can 1 shot most mobs with a slew of different weapons so what's the difference?
---
Legacies have never been responsible for minute queen kills
---
Some people have always and will always love/hate them
---
Bethesda did not make anything clear. They removed them from the drop pool because they refused to do a game wide balance update, something that continues to this day, and it was easier to remove them from the drop pool versus balancing everything. 
---
Bethesda can and does have the power to remove things from players inventories. Free Radical Masks used to be legendary, Firecracker Whiskey used to be obtainable, Bottlecap Mines were craftable, etc. 
---
Take care.

I have another suggestion for you, I waited till the post got a little traction before tagging you since you said you like suggestions. It‚Äôs close to 300 upvotes, Probably my most upvoted post.
---
I‚Äôm nearly level 40 in NW and I only seen two hackers. Am I really that lucky? I see people complain about them all the time.
---
I had an unyielding one.
---
Just a few minor things if I remember correctly it's a bit closer then that of the old list tho
---
Not currently, but I‚Äôve got most of the gear and perks to if that‚Äôs better.
---
Fair enough and I can absolutely respect that opinion. For everyone‚Äôs sake I hope a solution for it is in our future.
---
Any time!  FWIW I think you should team up with /u/valhalladisco who said in her comment that she's on PS4.  Good luck to you!

Same thing just happened to me.  Did you get resolution?

Before I rebuilt, I had a rough camp with tent and outhouse.  Beckett spent so much time in it I think he had a bad case of the runs, lol

They started testing them in the patch 19 test server I beleive. Confirmed the will not be here parch 21. Hopefully will see them patch 22. Its nice to see they are taking feed back and making changes. You can give direct feedback kn your thoughts over in PTS sub forum on beths site.

The only thing more difficult to spot than Bush wookie is a wet wookie.

What‚Äôs your weapon? Are you full Chameleon?Maybe it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs not silenced or it‚Äôs explosive.
---
No offense but you obviously have never tried this build
---
Yeah, it was. But based on commentary from Bethesda devs in interviews, they seem to have ripped that out when they forked Gamebryo to make the Creation engine, along with a bunch of other design changes that made pivoting back to multiplayer something of a nightmare.
---
Oh, so shooting at her without a silencer is revealing my position?

You will find a lot of low lvl players without fear.
---
Having to lvl up on a new low lvl is easier than you higher lvl main account.
---
Alot of banned players starting new accounts. Some of them with catchy new names like onthebannedwagon.
---
Chamelon probably doesn't help. I'd recommend unyielding gear to get over 30 agility. You will always be in caution though. Never hidden. But you shouldn't be in danger.
---
Good for you. For the people who do play it, it's nice to have at least some reward. Even if it's only 10% of what adventure mode gives
---
Freaking this. And the fact that the outline being green doesn't mean the game is actually going to let you put it down.
---
Yup
---
It's misleading, because you actually get damage numbers popping up when shooting at it while it's invulnerable. Additionally, the "damage" that you do during this time *does* allow you to loot it after it's dead, even if you do zero damage to it after its shields are down. (Meaning you technically did zero damage overall, but you still get the loot).
---
I think the above confusion, coupled with the very wordy and long-winded loading screen text, means that a lot of players think it's just another SBQ fight where the boss creature just simply has a ton of health to damage through, and there are no other objectives.
---
Oh god...another collection for me to buy lol. I currently have Ace collecting half ammo and half Fasnacht treats. Fasnacht collectron gets annoying but I will probably Bring him out for October fest.
---
So bloodied is really the only way to always be in caution?
---
That would be removing 2 of the few actually viable builds out there. What if, instead, they just reworked the system and kept with the player scaling aspect, meaning tougher fights even at a high level.
---
Alrighty. Gonna have to give it a try
---
Oh yeah. Unless you are trying to get rid of or gain mutations never take off Starched Genes.
---
It's it's own entity, I didn't have the base collectron so I couldn't place that one, the raider is it's own unit. The issue was I was trying to place it on my friend's base. I'm new to this game all over again so I'm learning as I go.
---
YESSSS. I'm building a new camp rn and the options r just making me wanna kms
---
There's a random female settler ally that requires a guitar/chair as her spawn item (like Beckett's bar), but I'm taking about a world spawn spot. There's a junk node south of the golf course with a couple burned out vehicles next to it, and near one of the burned out jeeps there's a chair, box table, and fire pit that acts as a spawn point for random settlers. 
---
At long as your camp circle covers that fire pit your ally will occasionally wander over and sit with the random settler.
---
Also, I don't know if the traveling merchant has a route they follow life Grahm or if they just spawn in. My camp is also on Grahm's route, so they might just be following his loop.
---
Edit: also, the random settler often gives me free magazines and recipes, and assorted drugs and booze spawn on the table next to them, so that's nice.
---
Being in caution isn't really a bad thing unless you use healing factor as your main source of healing
---
New players do not hold the same value on items as 800 hour veterans, who would have guessed? In other news, we are currently running an investigation as to whether fire is hot. Tune in for more at 9
---
Also, at least this might bring in something fresh to the table. Most vendors before game pass were either selling duped trash or random overpriced scrip fodder/junk plans at default value, maybe the new guys can bring in something better. If not, it's not like it can get any worse
---
I've never seen a froglegs dude actually kill anything haha 
---
Is it a good perk? The jump animations are so slow and easy to track compared to like fortnites bunny hoppers
---
My main character was originally intended to be a PA Heavy gun tank, but was waay too squishy. Just running bloodied PA with protocols makes me ten times tankier, and I do way more damage. Never looked back. Just used double XP to level an alt around a B2525 fixer I bought from a vendor for 20k. It's brutal. Nothing ever knows where I am and my stealth headshots do up to 250 per hit on the queen.
---
As a side, it took my first character about a month to hit lvl 50. It took my alt about 8 hours to hit level 100 in full Unyielding armor. That intelligence buff (stacked with double XP, scorchbeast brains, cranberry relish, and canned meat stew) gave me 1000 xp per kill
---
Considering legendary perks were in the 2019 roadmap, ill believe it when I see it.  At least they took a second pass, but they could use some work.
---
If you at all care about these perks be loud and frequent about complaining about them.  If history is any indicator, this stuff gets one pass and it‚Äôs done.
---
Enjoy your duped jumpsuit üòäüëå
---
We had no body to loot after the event ended, I assumed because he just shot at it while it was invisible. But I looted what I could off of what we did kill and just went on my way. Theres always more cards to use at a later time
---
I shoot it when it's invisible to draw it off the people with the pylons till they get all three of them, because as you know it goes to you like a magnet once you grab one. Maybe they were doing that and only realized you weren't *going* to take the rest of the pylons when you told them they were pointlessly shooting it.
---
If I showed up at an encryptid and only the people who started it were there I'd sort of assume they were prepared to tank the pylons before they burnt the card on it.
---
Yeah that's not what I am saying. I only last in caution a few seconds, then go into danger.
---
Long story short, they made it so it's crazy not to run bloodied, if you have the kit.
---
Nerd rage and serendipity ... the rest are depending what build your are
---
Power armor is great if you're running heavies
---
No.
---
I had a player sleep on my bed and thanked me one time. My camp is simple: A small vendor building, and a Red Rocket garage on either side. One is for chilling, and the other is for tinkering and what not. 
---
Its always too, nice to see people walk in and take a peak. I visited many of camps just to see how creative players can get.
---
Alas I lost all my main menu pictures when Bethesda's told me to reinstall the game...
---
78.  But I am weary of the grind.  Got the chicken coop today though!
---
Wow gamma gun still gives rads? Thought they patched that 
---
Finally I can defend my pet deathclaws
---
&gt;You're going to get downvoted like hell. 
---
Ironic
---
No? Can you elaborate?
---
I think that's there plan i just think it would be easier to balance builds with lower damage multipliers rather than just enemies with more health.
---
I mean some legendarys really go unused like banes and armor perks.
---
Just want them to unfuck my strangler armor that I grinded for, for a month
---
yes lol
---
I had hoped more people would show up. I had no intentions of tanking the pylon based on the sole fact that I couldnt. I didn't have enough stims to keep me alive long enough for the three of us to kill it, and the only other person made no move to go for the pylons either, which sucks but it isnt like I can force anyone to do something they dont want to
---
Then you get no dessert. No dessert unless you finish all of your Nuclear Winter challenges.
---
Nice.
---
Honestly I'm all for a rework. I'd love to see enemy specific weapons like zealots and ghoul slayers become powerful against those enemies. Other effects like stalkers could be reworked to become useful as well.
---
I am unsure since I haven't tried without unyielding gear. You don't have to be bloodied. You can be a low hp junkies with unyielding too. I mean low hp builds don't have to use a bloodied weapon. You have the mutation unyielding gear and nerd rage. It's viable to play a junkies stealth build too. If you are on the ground you may get danger from other ground mobs too by the way.
---
38 caps for purified water made me chuckle.
---
true that's why said damage across the board and offered other suggestions for nerfs to.
---
I fast traveled to a vendor camp that had a lot of ammo. Turns out it was all one kind and not the kind I was looking for. A waste of time and caps so I hit the vending machine out of frustration. Unbeknownst to me the owner of the camp was watching me and did not take kindly to me punching his machine. He must‚Äôve took offense so he put up his dukes and started to swing at me. I just fast traveled away.
---
I have its very op with ranged weapons, outside of Poison and such you are a death machine, i personally prefer junkies as it is almost as op but a lot harder to do but far more survivable.
---
It provides some bonuses, I think fire protection or something, and seems to have stats that are a bit better. Nothing game changing though, especially since it doesn't look too good with any other PA skin
---
This game is my only outlet and I grind it.
---
I won't lie, I may have flown off the handle, and u are right, I shouldnt say that from seeing one comment. I'm sorry for being a crappy ass person, between life rn (as I'm sure we all know), to just...  Things "just working" in one of my favorite game series, and seeing what I loved about it be basically torn to shreds(the dark humor and thought provoking narratives) after ive defended it many times to my own firends that is worth it. I mean how many times do they expect a fan to defend there shitty choices. Ik its only my fault and all but I pre-ordered this thing, as I'm sure most of u have. But why do we play it if it's not worth it, by playing it we show them that this treatment of this series is okay and even welcome. It's fucked man. The fans make a co-op experience in Skyrim to almost exactly what most have wanted since Oblivion, and they shit this out and and serve it to use, all while charging us extra for basic ass features. I just don't know how I can or anyone that grew up playing Bethesda games can support this game. It's literally a 180 what players wanted. I mean shit u can't even "raid" players proper. Ik when I say this that I'm in a very small percentage but some us role-play-ish their characters just to have a good time. This game allows non of it unless ur just lucky. U think I'm making all of this up, I get it I for one honestly don't get why or how I've been so unlucky with legendary drops, but most have been the exterminator effects. Why and how is that fair??? I'm trying to play a medic/flamer character and the game just throws random non-related armor at me. Give out stimpacks(granted diluted stimpacks) like candy, but the game can't throw me a bone? Not one? I tried looking the community several times to trade... Ripped off. Mind u I had to go out of the game to try and trade and find the shit I wanted at the time. Thats what pisses me off, I can understand me not getting or understanding shit bc I only play so often, but how do they expect to make this game popular if it's not even (yes I'll say it) easy enough for the casual players play proper? Fine then it's only for the dedicated players... Then say that Todd, don't sell this and say anyone can play. When in reality unless u have a friend to play with and you have hours to dump into it(oh and a solid connection bc it's online only..) ur not getting anywhere unless u Google/YouTube it... Why the fuck would I want to play this, it's laughable at best and boreder line false advertising at worse. Im sorry but I'ma finally coming to terms with why this game didn't do good. It wasn't the glitches or anything like that... No it's been the piss poor treatment of long time fans. I may not dive deep into game mechanics but damn it l not my fault they made a jank ass game. There's no way around it, it's just simply bad. Take away ur love for fallout and Bethesdas golden days out of ur mind and u start to realize they're just purely out for money( I get its a business, but there used to be a little extra and its gone... Right out the window). I will change my tone when I see TES6... If it has a single microtransaction or hides stuff that was or should be free in the game behind a pay wall(looking at portable camping/cooking IN A SURVIVAL GAME)... I'm done. They know exactly how they have been treating there player base, and we keep giving them another chance. Sometime u gotta let it die man. Enjoy it if u can, idk why anyone can or would considering there's just better version of this game type out there with dev teams that would not only love the traffic but also hear us out. Ps once again I'm sorry, there's enough hate in the world rn as it is... It's just I can't type this to anyone that would actually listen to a fans complaints, u can all get mad and down vote(it would represent the slow decent Bethesda has taken), but at the end of the day I'm just trying to make my voice heard in an echo chamber of what basically equates to a circle jerk. If I try and post my complaints it's taken down(even if only like 10 people skim past without ever reading), as a fan I feel un heard and frankly like my favorite developer is shiting on me, all while the player base of other fans tear each other apart bc we can't agree on what makes fallout, fallout... Bc with this game in existence, it's just the name anymore(oh and that crappy ass engine they've been updating since, what? Morrowind). Call me a fuck face if u want honestly Its nothing that Todd/Bethesdas hasn't already make me feel.
---
(edit) Ps I do love things in this title, but they are far from making this game worth the time and headaches... Nor the extra money. I mean we can't even be guaranteed our stuff or our base will be there the next time we log in... Also quite apparent they didn't let any of the casual players know there's two form authentication this is the first I'm hearing of it. So my bad on that, and anything else I got wrong, but not everyone has time to follow everything. This shit should have been there since day one after beta.   And as someone that is a actually red headed step child... This game is and always will be that to me. Extra side note: are we really ok with Bethesdas becoming money hungry when this flagship series of theirs literally parodies companies that are like that...??? Stop and think about that, and then tell me u still like what their doing.
---
Welcome to the game my friend I think most of us (myself included) have that experience.
---
Yea k hear ya. But honestly i rather them be really good. Especially considering the amount of time it will take to level them. I think patch 21 is coming aug 4th.
---
Keep savin that flux!
---
Number 8 is my favorite.
---
It bypasses the fade-in that follows the loading screen while grass and such is generated.
---
I don't do the NW challenges and I'm still 56/100 on the score. I dont get the auto complete bug though so that helps!
---
I think they want a Fallout 76 Stimulus and unemployment check ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I will typically only do encrypted right after a successful SBQ. That gives me a chance to gauge the players on the server. Plus players are all perked up from the fight and rush to encrypted typically.
---
Stalkers is fine, my wife loves it.  
---
i think the bane legendary effects would be stronger if you there where not better legendary effects like junkies or bloodied.
---
It doesn't make sense to me that the plans you buy even show up again after. You can't trade them so theres no point in getting multiple anyway. Just seems weird.
---
I've killed myself more than anything after switching to bloodied. My best stuff are explosive so I've blown myself up more than anything. Radiation is a very close second I've learned to keep at least 10 radaway on me at all times just in case. Other than that I love my bloodied build. Can't wait to get a bloodied gauss shotgun. Currently rocking a junkies one with a bloodied handmade as a side weapon. Would take a lot to make me switch to a different playstyle
---
No, bloodied is not the only build that can stay in caution around the Queen.
---
 I am a stealth full health rifleman and I can shoot her dead blank in the face and she still never sees me.
---
Could you provide me with your build?
---
They would probably be 2k if sold.
---
That's pretty good advice. I didnt even think about dropping a nuke after Encryptid since so little people showed up I figured SBQ would've failed too, and I dont want to burn through my keycards. I save them for double exp weekends usually
---
Just got it yesterday.  Yay double xp!
---
Oh hey, I just found one of those people that just wants to make the game and/or PvP sound bad. 
---
Guess what bud? Even if they were on the same team, that 260 could **not** have damaged you at all unless you attacked him first.
---
I think there can be a happy medium. Make it so bloodied and junkies are still viable, but not OP compared to most other effects. If they did that I'd be all for it. This way people could run things other than bloodied/junkies.
---
As somebody who avidly plays NW, it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. People running an SSD may be eliminated just the same, albeit an annoyance to spawn next to.
---
You can hide in a bush like everybody else, but to be honest that can get extremely boring. Truth is, you're gonna die. Alot.
---
I haven't been playing for a long time, so this is all personal experience. When I first started, I was able to down someone MAYBE before I'd get killed. Usually bit off more than I could chew after watching somebody from a bush for 20-30 seconds. I was playing strictly 1st person since that is how I have played every FO game. 
---
Thing I did that made NW easier;
---
-Changed my X &amp; Y sensitivity until it was comfortable
---
-Learned how to use 3rd person
---
-Learned when to hide &amp; when to attack
---
-Collected a few decent perk cards w/ many deaths
---
-Use Chems. You'll find more
---
-Sometimes you gotta duck into the fire
---
In the end however it'll only really get easier as you get more comfortable &amp; experienced with it. Always assume somebody will be looking at you the moment you fire a weapon, Frog Legs will change everything, Crossbow is extremely strong, and if you're on PC Hackers will ruin a match real fast. I've been having a blast since starting but I did not have a blast sneaking around bush to bush.
---
And also please if you join a team try and atleast use a little teamwork. So many people will leave you for dead or run off to do their own thing, then you're just flying solo against folks who will work together to take you out.
---
I'd love to do that if I didnt load in 30 seconds after everyone else and everything's already gone so I have to run like a Ricky bobby
---
Why are people downvoting this, it's true lol. I went for a junkie's build even before the TSE nerf, the downsides are completely negligible unless you're a melee build, and even then it just takes a bit of maneuvering to get the addictions that don't lower strength. Bloodied is stupid powerful by making you a full stealth tank DPS build all in one, junkie's is just a free damage boost that is universal and superior to everything except bloodied. There are many ways they can go about fixing it, but the balance here is absolute garbage and it needs to be drastically changed if they want to introduce any real content. They should have learned that already based on how badly the raids flopped
---
To make sure you grind more.
---
4 including yourself of course.
---
yesss perfect that's all i'm saying.
---
Yea I don't do either of them unless I know the server is stacked safely. I also tank the pylons often (minimum of two) and usually end up not getting shots on the enemy. I usually don't care I just want the xp.
---
Not on the chest piece. You can do jet pack on the chest and deep pocketed on the 4 limbs.
---
I did this by accident as well (with an ss mod), no refund possible. Sucks, but live and learn to go slower.
---
Had a level twenty at a queen fight just trying SO hard with a little bolt action pistol. I had him come to my camp after and gave him a level 20 TSE and some ammo. He was pot shotting his little heart out.
---
Man, I have no idea how many times I‚Äôve explained this before, but I guess I‚Äôll just be blunt about it now. 
---
Because of PC, this will never, ever happen. I‚Äôm on PC, and while I *love* the custom loading screens that I have *because I can put whatever I want in the picture/camera roll/photo mode/whatever folder*, does not mean everyone wants to see deathclaws the same way I do. So no, this will never be a feature
---
I've spawned in the same spot and got the same magazine, so at least the spawn points and magazines that spawn there are fixed or have few options.
---
Yah I should have...
---
I've seen it happen only once and once only but people were able to kill it without the pylons. Seen the healthbar go down a lil then shoot back up until many people were shooting it causing it to die. At the same time these players were the same ones that were able to kill the queen and colussus in a matter of seconds. So it's very suspicious
---
Then we are in agreement! Hopefully a rework will be coming soon, I'd love to see stuff like assassins and suppressors (maybe even nocturnal) become useful and widely used.
---
Reading your post just now, I have this image in my head of Alexandria from The Walking Dead show.
---
We are human beings, we can not be shut down by some command code. A synth is just a machine. Sure it can mimic humans but it will never be one. A robot is a robot no matter how shiny the paint job is.
---
I don't have any ranged bloodied guns so idk but ik melee Is very strong but it's also very easy to die too
---
The camp system is so damn buggy that I have to glitch things to make them work properly.
---
Bethesda should just remove all restrictions, who cares? Let us be creative with our own camps..
---
I dunno man. I‚Äôm a bloodied junkie, and I just forget about the chem withdrawals like...all the time because I‚Äôm managing my rads more. Junkies is considered the poor man‚Äôs bloodied for a reason: it‚Äôs easy and literally anyone can do it.
---
Why would they rename Anti-Venom, a name that's clear and concise and tells you exactly what the effect does, to Funky Duds, a name that makes no god damn sense to me?
---
It's not supposed to take damage while invisible, I think it even says that on the terminal thats used to start the event so that's odd to me, but kudos for being able to do that. Obviously have to have more than 3 people for it lol
---
I had mine setup like this. I ran emergency protocols, only carried super stims, and used colas to help AP. Pretty much immortal in PVE.

The Bush Wookie is an antisocial creature, reacting violently when even another Bush Wookie encroaches on their nesting ground.  Sadly such encounters between two Bush Wookies almost always ends in the death of both due to the attraction of other predators.
---
I also only play pve so idk about pvp
---
I saw someone have a similar complaint with the wood ghillie armor earlier today I believe. I imagine there will be issues like to this to some degree with most of the ghillie armors if not all.
---
I've done hundreds. Most of the time its junk except for the flux, one time I got ultracite reactive plates. But that was once ever and I sold it for 40k.
---
All good until you realize youre one damn pixel away from actually reaching max rank
---
It‚Äôs as big as any Pok√©mon town, lmao.
---
I saw some guy jumping up in the air (had to be marsupial) swinging a fiery blade at the SBQ when she did low passes today. Was hilarious.
---
Took me 400 levels of tinkering to make my setup.
---
 Try making a full set of thorn armor with muffled legs and see if that helps.
---
I almost exclusively do melee only and die all the time but mostly because I‚Äôm careless. I sneak around and can usually kill 4 or more enemies before getting caught but when I get caught üíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
The last camp on my melee character was there, built as extension of the house.   I really liked it, but didn‚Äôt need the plastic and eventually moved to a cliff overlooking the forest near the wood mill.   Beautiful view!
---
Good way to level up one hit everything lol run and not using any bullets üòÇüëç
---
Yea just if hes in a group message the higher levels and let them know that way you dont run into the same situation I had. Couple 35s joined me and i guess they were attacking other players, I didnt know and they got yeeted they messaged me for help so I showed up and scared off the 2 they were fighting. Got some nasty messages from them and I ignored them for the most part thinking they were messing with the low levels. Well the next day my friend gets on and the 2 low levels rejoin on me and attack him. I felt bad about the 2 higher levels now cause I'm sure the 2 low levels initiated it now and used me as a scare tactic
---
FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK THIS SUCKS.

by completing re-working it for Fallout 4? you're not making any sense.
---
You cursed me.  May all your legendaries be 1-star rolling pins!
---
Whoa really? What‚Äôs the name of it?
---
i think it is totally ok if u dont do damage. but u can tag him at least to be able to loot his ass afterwards. if u r not interested it is totally fine.
---
Added you. Can you confirm if you got it?
---
Damn, meant can‚Äôt...
---
Beautiful
---
Heh, I thought you were talking about a Texas Instruments graphing calculator
---
Can‚Äôt buy deep pocketed mods for any of the secret service limbs
---
Exactly
---
Never mind someone linked it below I‚Äôm a noob
---
Not always.  Sometimes if you can work out which specific piece is being problematic, you can build another "accessable" snap, then work from the piece it didn't want gone back to nothing.  But yeah, sometimes it gets stupid and you end up potentially ponying up to set down in the same place.
---
Same here. I love building the camp and seeing people check it out and relax in my camp.
---
How so?
---
Yeah that is true I've done that a few times
---
Ok, but I will, so...
---
Just skip it.
---
For explosive definitely run fireproof
---
This one, I swear I've been closer to chucking my controller because "you showed green, wtf is your problem build mode"  than death due to lag ever gets me.
---
So my question is what makes it so important your pc, I‚Äôm on Xbox and I can do the same, personally I want my photos on the wall for me, I can bet I have photos that no one will ever get do to fluke chances of how a ghoul landed cross legged on a couch on arm on the rest and the other on the back lounging like a lizard, and to be blunt not everyone thinks the same as you you speak out for yourself, I‚Äôm sure lots would agree but there‚Äôs also people that would disagree
---
Sweet my psn is Alan_Hawk9 when it comes up
---
He gives me the note. As I‚Äôm reading it, he starts walking away and says, ‚Äúnothing personal‚Äù lmfao
---
Once the screen goes black, open the social menu (on PC, this is ctrl-tab or shift-tab, I forget which), then once the social menu opens, hit ESC and you can move around and bypass the "frozen in place" at round start.  This trick has existed since NW came out, although the means by which you accomplish it has changed a couple times (when the game came out, it was hit escape twice....then they changed it so you would open up social menu during loading screen and hit ESC when screen turned black.  Now they made it so you can't open loading screen during loading screen, so you do it once the screen turns black and hit ESC now)
---
Thanks
---
Mine are mostly set up to do bloody or full health with minimal swaps. Tanking envrytipd solo is something I can do at full health, but I cant quite bloodied yet.
---
Man, I just have a little utility platform with basic crafters I can throw down wherever. I should really get fancy with it.
---
I agree with you. Personally, I would like to see more clarity when it comes to suspensions. For example: Regarding Enforcement, give an immediate estimation for the duration - for first time offenders -  If he makes a small amount of whatever, suspend him for 3 days and give a stern warning while letting him back into the game with the character unaffected. If he makes 100,000 of the same items, ban his butt and make him do a unique challenge to get unbanned, post it where it can be seen, and let him back into the game after removing all extras of the same item.
---
How did you lose it? That's the file that you download. It replaces the stock file.
---
You done Davenports photos and given them to ward?
---
Edit- sorry was channelling my own grind, I already did Raiders. So have you done Davenports photos and given them to Meg :D
---
They changed it so any responder bot can sell mod plans, check the Responder bot in the Whitesprings, I for sure saw some in there the other day
---
Me too I'm also junkie I have a junkie super sledge with 50% limb dam and a bloodied sledge hammer with 40 swing speed but I forget about the super sledge lol
---
Man I've seen some high level players selling plans for ashtrays for 100 caps lol
---
No
---
Grats! It‚Äôs a damn grind that‚Äôs for sure!
---
All the situational need a boost to 50%
---
It exists because of blueprinting, specifically the games ability to automatically generate blueprints.
---
The game blueprints structures sequentially, moving from piece to piece based on their connections.  If you were for example to place a staircase and connected upper floors and you could remove the staircase the game would then be unable to identify those floating floors as still being a part of the structure.
---
Automatically generated blueprints were a lot more important when the game initially released due to overlapping camps meaning your camp would be removed and would need to be rebuilt.
---
Nice! Is your channel same as your reddit name? I'll give it a looksee and sub if it's stuff I vibe with haha
---
Good. I'm glad you're not a flake.
---
One star missile launchers on both of my latest attempts, one zealot's one mutant's, both useless to me
---
I mean, when i replace it other original file is gone and this mods file is not working it seems so... I cant cant in the game even i extract the mod in the Data folder...
---
Can supply a private server on PS4 also. I‚Äôm a little short on friends but I‚Äôd be happy to allow a sub based team to help you out, OP.
---
Annoying either way.  I'm not exactly for no restrictions, but we need the option to toggle snap off at least.
---
I _usually_ dislike building "impossible" structures, but when those restrictions actually make it harder to make things seemingly obey physics... arg.  And then on the rare times I want to do something crazy, it still gets in my way.
---
I hateeeee that you can't do that pose with your camera while in photo mode
---
I wanna take a picture of my dude taking pictures so bad man lmao
---
I just got FO76 free on PC Gamepass, so in order to enjoy it with friends, I paid the $13 or whatever to get a month of Fallout 1st for the private servers. I‚Äôve had to clear and set up Lakeside cabins like 5 times even tho I‚Äôm leaving the game while at the workshop. The private worlds, as far as I can tell, don‚Äôt remember our workshops, which is a shame.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about turning in mirelurk meat (I can‚Äôt remember who or where, I‚Äôve never done it) but apparently it gives rep too
---
Fuk u nub. Git gud.
---
(Sorry. Just trying to balance things out. üòÇ)
---
Yeah.  I‚Äôm server-hoping NAR repair yard. It‚Äôs a good place for getting the Raiders to spawn and also the occasional legendary.
---
My mom and I ran into it in one of those pink forests. Someone had nuked the place and we were farming for fluids when I saw it in the forest.
---
We were so excited and it was hilarious everytime it sent us fleeing but man did it take forever to kill.
---
Are you still doing this?
---
I've personally like snapping, cus I'm OCD so I don't like things out of place, but we definitely need less restrictions. It's definitely becoming a major issue.
---
Hopefully it works for ya my dude. I get the raiders a lot at sundew grove also for what it's worth. 
---
Good luck!
---
Done that already today.
---
Aw man. Good luck!

One Wasteland in two months, Fractured Steel in five months.
---
I made a heavy gunner and vats crit sniper, not bloodied or anything. Then made a bloodied unarmed melee. Can barely play my other characters now because they just feel stupid weak.
---
It's just very suspicious to have it happen. I was there for a queen fight. And went straight to encrypted and had the thing die as I was running to a conduit. Like before while not knowing what to do I shot the assaultron and saw it was healing rapidly but these guys some how out did it's healing. It's cool but very suspicious.
---
Think it's just the Playstation community. Plans still dirt cheap on PC and Xbox from what I have looked at. I usually drop all my known plans in train stations or at the end of events.
---
I got a nocturnal missile launcher as well lol
---
Idk if anyone said this but ore can be Smelted at chemistry stations. If you have a bunch of ore, it could be liter.
---
I put a bunch of stairs on a foundation to get the daily challenge and can't do a thing with any of it now, so I had to incorporate it into my camp as an execution tower.
---
Doesn't matter for me. The stuff I use will one shot me at full health with fireproof on only once have I survived with 1 health point.
---
:)
---
Like 85 ? I think.
---
I'm on xbone and haven't noticed anything different tbh
---
I mean i still see the odd camp with ludicrous prices
---
If they did something like that I‚Äôd be so happy
---
I had this happen when I went to turn in my settler daily. Had to do a couple random encounters to get that damn pixel.
---
yeah, i'm not sure that they can do maybe have real withdrawal symptoms and not just negative SPECIAL. Lower movement speed or vats regeneration.
---
Something you really need to think about when become a junkie. mutations work great in this respect.
---
Apparently I was wrong there is a brief window when it first appears you can tag it must of been what I've been doing. So be quick
---
Lmao. Gotta make the best with what ya got right?
---
This has already been shared with the team :)
---
Yep. Newbies or people trying to rip off newbies on Xbox. I am on Xbox so I can't speak to PS4 but I have seen some egregious pricing lately.
---
Dam do you use power armor?
---
Lol I think I'd rather get a rolling pin next, it can go on display in the camp kitchen
---

---
 &gt; This has already been shared with the team :)
---
That‚Äôs what I did
---
nocturnal is okay since it synergies with sand man but it should not a negative damage during the day and should work inside.
---
Guess I found my new side piece. Didn't know it did this.
---
Lower movement speed, health, vats regen, ap, would actually make addiction a trade-off. Also if your character would just occasionally use drugs from your inv that they were addicted to, that's something I tried to do in my fnv/f4 runs in the past. You'd have to either cure the addiction, stock up on larger amounts of chems and have that burn through your pocket, or accept more severe withdrawal from not having any on you
---
Oh, by the way, it is Ohio River Adventures.
---
The Mire really makes me think of Far Harbor, if you‚Äôre jonesing for a look alike.
---
I agree. I‚Äôve gotten so mad at camp building, it makes me want to scream sometimes. After several I give ups and wanting to throw the controller, I get my camp done. Nice and neat. After deleting a building 10 times because one section doesn‚Äôt want to delete. I‚Äôve even had to replace down my camp cause of it. Haha.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs rough
---
I'm use power armor and melee so it's weaker than the unyielding combo but I like it because I love my almost complete t65  armor and it's not like one shot everything but I can also take a few more hits and I don't have to worry about rads as much
---
No power armor needs a massive overhaul before I use it. Like I like the idea of it and what not but it needs some buffs and stuff.
---
It's like Bethesda doesn't play test their stuff before they implement it lol
---
So... in order for them to get a useful perk that would be good for beginners they must first rank up and unlock legendary perks?
---
Very agreed.  I mostly dislike snapping when I'm trying to trick a course of foundations into hiding anywhere the corners appear floating.
---
Dieing for some damn Aries backstory. If the clues are there, somebody help. He mentions blood in his throat prewar, and his hands aren't all fecked up, so he's probably human with a wrecked throat?? or maybe he's just making up excuses for his voice and wears gloves made from human flesh to cover up he's a ghoul for reasons unknown?
---
Why? It‚Äôs free when you shoot down the bot.
---
Yeah that would be perfect. basically you are very vulnerable when not on drugs, but become a god when on them.  
---
Great for melee builds who don't use ammo since now you have something to farm rather than lead.
---
We can hold out hope what when they change the food system, chems might be included.
---
I still don't have the "place your camp" achievement.  I put it down in BETA and haven't had to move it.
---
My lawn looks great though!
---
Why? They‚Äôre free it just takes a couple minutes.
---
How fucking clueless can someone be?
---
Power armor already gets innate damage mitigation against ALL damage types for each piece equipped, it doesn't fucking need any more damage mitigation.  Just being able to put Emergency Protocols on it with a bloodied build makes you near unkillable even without other perks.  
---
That's ignoring the fact that your info is so far behind that those legendary perks don't even exist any more.
---
And that godly rad resist perk you think is going to obsolete power armor in nuke zones?  It doesn't because again, PA has innate bonuses to rad resist and that's what makes it do good in nuke zones in the first place.  People already tested the fucking thing in nuke zones and even with rad resist armor and the best chems it's not sustainable.
---
If you have the right perks you don‚Äôt die much. I‚Äôm a sneak commando on all characters. 4 full health, 1 bloodied. The bloodied has around 350 damage resistance and with serendipity and dodgy, plus dense chest mod. I rarely die.
---
I alternate unarmed and power armour/2h for tankiness if I'm at SBQ or doing a silo. But 9/10 times no PA/unarmed
---
I love seeing things like 600 caps for Mounted Radstag, or 3000 caps for raider jetpack. Nothing can top the camp I found, selling missiles and mini nukes for 50c and 100c each, respectively. This was clearly someone who had been playing a while, as they had tons of rare camp plans, and some atom shop stuff that hasn't been out in a long time.
---
Yes. Just another tick on the list of game design flaws lol
---
If only they could see the reactions of people trying to build. They could make a reality show of that. üòÇ
---
Still too pricey for me
---
I used an AI to up the resolution so it'd fit my monitor better. I thought I'd share!

I honestly cleared about 200 weight from my stash by using the ammo converter on my mini nukes and missiles. I had no idea i had so many since any ammo I dont use i just add to my vendor and forget about. I had 1 nuke left and some guy bought it today clearing another 6 units.
---
I had a lvl 107 ask me why I explode when things hit me.
---
I thought mutations was a really common knowledge thing.
---
What's the error code?
---
This is some GOOD investigation! I appreciate you‚Äôre dedication to the cause! I wonder if we set up nearby if we can trigger it again. Do you mind linking the location of the event on the map???
---
I‚Äôm an admin for a TF2 community server. Trust me, people like to show off their taste in porn, a lot. 
---
‚ÄúOh! But u/Nathan_TK! I wouldn‚Äôt do that! I just want to show off the two ghouls on the golf course that look like they‚Äôre cuddling on the green!‚Äù
---
Yeah. I wanna show off my cool pictures too. But there‚Äôs a reason why we can‚Äôt. The same reason we can‚Äôt have custom player icons. Could Bethesda just have someone hired to review and approve/deny pictures before the rest of 76 can see them? Yeah, they can. But, they‚Äôre not going to, because that would be more money going to paychecks and less to the bank.
---
They are easy to shot down shot the wings so it stop moving also it 1 card a person I have friends that don‚Äôt drop nukes so they come along and I get there card too
---
See I was a full heavy guns build so I live in pa and it's very fun especially against poison dealers I have to be careful but I like the challenge
---
They should have used the service rifle skin for the handmade as a new weapon calling it the secret service rifle which is black. The automatic version should fire shots in bursts of three.
---
Or an easy cop out is just give a legendary crafted version of the guess rifle and let it be modded to be automatic. Easy solution
---
I agree. I love Aries!
---
I just did the event. Lvl 226 on my build team starts the event and we wait around for people to show up. There‚Äôs three of us then a lvl 17 shows up running to the cabin. I start opening fire on him when he moves to the computer but it was too late. He did the recall and got a bunch of thumbs down.
---
But straight up? And visible at distance? I‚Äôm not doubting your testing because it is similar!!!
---
Those perks were removed.
---
I knew what you meant.  I‚Äôve done all that. Just going to grind NAR Repair for the Raiders and the occasional squatch (which just showed up).

I think it's amusing that people put things up for that much when I'm here selling chems valued at 80 for 5 a piece
---
I sell all plans for 5 caps a piece no matter what.
---
When you get appreciated by bethesda themselves
---
It does but I also don't want it to be op. emergency protocols makes up for a lil bit
---
(CE-34878-0) been 30 min of resetting wifi, taking game out, starting console over. fun after a long day
---
Just keep doing main questlines.... I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything
---
whoever told you that is misinformed.
---
BEAUTIFUL &lt;3
---
Wtf great idea...
---
Bethesda: Can we get a waving the montenegran and albanian flags emote please? If america gets one they should too
---
Im about to redownload fo76 just because of this pic lol
---
Ok. Waste of easy score.
---
I use my mic almost all the time. Most people can hear me and some will send a message, others emote or do whatever to make it known I can be heard. Got close to winning with a low level in NW this way talking the guy through what i was doing and having him set up for ambushes.
---
I usually sell all mine for 15-20 caps a piece, even the ones valued at like 1,000 or 500
---
I want those and a Paraguayan one too
---
That's an error code that deals with the console itself. So somethings up with your console.
---
It really needs to award like Fasnacht. Everyone gets a 3* direct.
---
yup on ps4
---
Won't lie, I kinda like it.
---
I just wish I could place more than 10 bone chimes as decor.
---
Some one did same to me used my card and they then decided to start my event for me lol
---
uwu
---
Check out the PTS part of the official bethesda forum, good way to see whats going on in the PTS
---
I know how to get them. I drop multiple nukes every day. Not sure what your point is. Do you agree or disagree with me? I think it‚Äôs annoying having to server hop and get them one by one.
---
I'd be happy if when I have more than some number of level ups waiting to NOT ask me if I want to use them / open a pack. 
---
10 maybe. Definitely if u have more than 100.
---
üòÜ a new meaning to g.i.l.f.
---
That‚Äôs a reasonable, sad to say it would have a high potential to be ruined in That manner by a large majority
---
Isn't it only open for some kind of quest? I'm probably thinking of something else but I feel like there's a gimmick to opening the door at least
---
It's the nose that really gets em
---
Welcome Miss Waffle need to do another photo shoot.
---
Pretty damn fucking clueless if you think 40% damage reduction is somehow better than 40% damage avoidance. Really fucking clueless since I even gave you a clue when I mentioned a damage reduction curve at a certain levels. You straight up didn't even read any of that shit lol. You picked out the radiation comment which was already talked about hours ago. 
---
Bro. Read.
---
I love bases like yours. I hate the ugly ass floating boxes people build to try and keep people out(not us moon jumping muties though)keep up the good work! I have my purifiers and crops kinda hidden but no locks on it so if someone does make it in they can help themselves. Hidden only for aesthetic reasons, on the edge of the whitesprings resort.
---
I noticed this after Wastelanders. It's odd.
---
Worst of all, you can‚Äôt be a cannibal while using PA! Literally useless.
---
I just know I used to go through it after getting the bombs for the bomb protectron ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I want those and an Irish one.
---
Load a different online game and after it connects close it and retry fo76
---
Idk I got a 3* quad automatic Tesla today for 800 caps off a level 20. It was level 50. No idea how he got it but it's baller.
---
Blessing in disguise. Well, not rlly.
---
I've got 4 alts, mostly for camp building 
---
Secondarily for playing with different builds.
---
Yes its the nose. It just grows on you.
---
Short Answer: No. Longer answer: Only if you like the look. I have it on my main character, and it makes me feel like a BAMF when I run around in my T-65 wielding my Gauss Minigun.
---
I think you have to do it from main menu, or at least your friends do, but it could be both. When I had a friend invite a group to his world, we had to go to main menu first but I don‚Äôt remember what he had to do.
---
Bruh. Turn our pain into entertainment.
---
literally only online game i have. everything else is off. boutta just give up
---
Nuke boobies
---
Because that's just what I think Bethesda would charge lol. Haven't you seen the cost of plans. They charge over 1k for a holotape which does nothing!
---
Anti-Armor would be fine, since they deal ballistic damage.
---
n00b
---
Last time i ran this event i was surprised to see how effective my Furious Faster fire rate flamer was on the Imposter and even while invisible i was able to out do its healing factor. I had taken a quarter of its health before it lasered me into oblivion and only then did its health reset, i suspect if four people with this setup did this the Imposter could be downed while still invisible.
---
Nukatiddy
---
the damage multiplier are to high to balance, its better if we lower damage across the board instead. otherwise no mater how much we buff enemies it wont mater.
---
Someone convinced me I needed to sell plans for 1 cap less than the Bethesda assigned value. That didn't work so I am now doing half and now they're moving. but if it's a pretty common plan much less, or I just drop it at a train station.
---
Most of us higher level players enjoy helping new players cause it breaks the grind up we have become so use to. Plus the hoarders like me have so much stuff we will never realistically use that donating it to the up and comers seems like a better idea.
---
Doubt this one was duped, sold by a guy who had little progress achievement wise and was level 23 (everything he had was suggested price) besides dupers wouldn't be letting something like that go for 50 caps
---
Which is the exact reason why I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôll never happen. 
---
Now, Bethesda *could* do what Tower Unite does, I‚Äôm asking if you want to trust/allow user-uploaded images to show on your screen, and if you select no have it just default to....I dunno, a picture of the Vault Boy or something. But again, that would mean Bethesda has to do something that allows custom files to be uploaded to their servers, which they probably don‚Äôt want.
---
Just go to bed, gn
---
well what other build avoids 45% damage of damage while under 30% health.
---
Its really always been that way. Common plans for hundreds or thousands of caps. Its all duped mounts or the most basic plan like the ashtray or sunshine oil for 500+ caps now. The problem was everyone found so many discarded dupes that camps are loaded with plans so you are probably just noticing it more but its always been bullshit pricing on plans.
---
2 point per level, make it retro active.
---
5 point per card scrapped animated or not. Keep it simple.
---
Or just 1 point per level. 1 point per scrapped card and significantly reduce total cost to upgrade them. Thats simpler yet.
---
Just got first place and final kill, 3 kills total I think. Lets gooooo! I Had to run through the fire and radiation to get up a cliff in morgantown. I popped a radaway before I went through used all but 1 of my stimpacks to do it and had a sliver when i stepped out, thankfully i was still healing, thankfully I had on PA and was using a Handmade otherwise i would have been done for. Was a really satisfying way to end my time playing nuclear winter for today. If it wasnt for my team and especially the last remaining member besides myself SnowWolf11 (or was it TheSnowWolf11) I couldnt have pulled it off as well as I did.
---
Someone said something about not wanting events to fail, and I get that but certainly there‚Äôs a time and a place. 
---
As a bloodied melee, I‚Äôll run around and give everything a stab with my weakest weapon and that usually brings it to half... allowing others to finish it off and reap the benefits.
---
I do not understand this could someone explain it to me lol
---
Yes thank you so much.   You are the best
---
I built a house with a Slocum Joe's on the first floor and put his bar next to a SJ vender bot with the SJ bar across the front.
---
I put barstools in front of that and put Beckett in an Amusement Park outfit with a chef's hat.
---
of course I did, I asked him if he wanted me to kill him to get rid of the wanted status and I didn't take any of his stuff
---
Meanwhile there's always some dude has his work benches on the roof and the stash box camouflaged as a cooler hidden behind a counter
---
If someone plays Nuclear Winter then joins adventure any nuke zone (on the adventure map) has a chance to appear much larger.  
---
It‚Äôs just a visual glitch.  The nuked zones are really just the normal size.   This visual glitch has been around for a while now.
---
Game bugged nukes looked bigger on the map
---
As a student of business, one can maximize their profits in so many creative ways. Lmao. üòÇ
---
Ok. Thanks! Is AA good on a Gauss Minigun? I‚Äôm a non-bloodied PA heavy build.
---
I carry a prosnap camera with me all the time, I take pictures of peoples camps that look super cool. It makes for a nice surprise when the pics cone up as load screens.
---
I tried everything but the gauss pistol so heres my input
---
Gauss shotgun was great with VATS due to the bugged "magic" before update 20. Maybe still ok (haven't touched the thing since then) also great alternative the ammo heavy gauss minigun.
---
Gauss Minigun was top tier during the honeymoon phase but then you realize that's it's no better than a LMG but a bit better then every heavy gun that isn't bugged. Also ammo to feed the monster is fucked in terms of weight even with Batteries Included. 
---
Plasma Caster basically an energy version of a gatling gun but a bit more powerful and with way less clip size. Pretty decent heavy gun but really only for mobs and certain bosses. For example a Bloodied Plasma Caster can one shot a level 68 Super Muntant provided you have adrenaline stacks. 
---
Also I'd love a gauss rifle with different receivers but who knows if BGS are adding new weapons to buy with buillion.
---
I wish there was an on screen ping to notify you of players within your camps building area. I‚Äôll admit I sometimes forget to check before I log.
---
Ah awesome! :) 
---
I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs been passed on, thanks for replying. I hope we can eventually make the fixer black and stealthy with the Dark Matter skin.
---
I notice it alot when I go back to adventure mode after playing NW. Just some odd visual bug I believe.
---
Warmed it up for ya
---
I don't think they where a group the level 15 was in my camp long before the level 260 came
---
Same. The only things I'd like to have are the raider mask and settler backpack...
---
Im on Xbox and I sell all my plans for whatever it first says except the ultracite jet pack I think I'm selling that for 1500or 2000
---
Oh, sweet jesus, I was wondering how people have weapons when I  join in... There's no timer? They don't have a cold hold screen then flip? Come on...
---
I always hit it while I'm running to grab the pylons, vampire weapons will still heal you if shes invisable, and you hit her. Partlf what allows me to keep my stim usage down.
---
Picture frames should be on that list, too.
---
Read?  This from the person crying about perks THAT NO LONGER EVEN EXIST and haven't for almost two weeks now?
---
And I "picked out" your radiation comments?  For fuck sake you brought it up as your grand conclusion even with an additional link to try supporting your idea that it was going to obsolete PA.
---
Have you been letting all of this PA angst stew ever since they first released the perks for testing?
---
Cut my life into pieces. This is my last resort. Suffocation. No Breathing. Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding.
---
Damn your logic, but thanks for bringing a solid fact based argument to this
---
withdrawal effects are a joke though, I'm barely losing anything for having 5 addictions
---
Lol ik what you mean today I found some one selling a lvl 45 aa meat hook w 40% swing speed for 750 caps I bought it right away and I'm now looking to trade lol
---
I run a PA Vampire gatling laser build and it is by far the most fun build for pve ive done. I can tank any enemy in the game easily.
---
Is the head a limb?  If a weapon has 50% limb damage, does all this disscussion apply to the head?  That would make that star a great weapon perk.
---
If you use rifles or pistols there's a decent plasma rifle in the raider path. Otherwise just take both until you must choose and from there whatever floats your boat. 
---
It's arguable raiders have the better bullion weapon.
---
Ah okay I've never seen it before that's the only reason I ask
---
The whole game is a waste of time. I'm not farming notes, I like doing the events. Powerlevelling is boring. Its really not hard to start getting an excess of them if you do more than a few events during a play session.
---
It's not even on a rotation there. The Responders vendor in the Whitespring has a fixed list of most of the Excavator mod plans, just like the BOS vendor has for T-series power armor and the Raiders vendor has for Raider power armor.
---
Needs to be removed.  Camps need a pass overall.
---
But just because u avoid half damage doesn't mean you won't die easy if it's poison damage you will die really quick
---
I think they should be sold at enclave but on a cool down timer. It would just be too easy to buy them. I myself never run silos so I usually sell em in my vendor. I enjoy shooting the cargo bot down though so it‚Äôs not really a nuisance to me with a furious explosive minigun. Shreds in seconds. The other guy had a point though, BGS would definitely make you pay a pretty hefty price if they were sold by a non player vendor. That‚Äôs just what they do. No rhyme or reason.
---
I just got another one yesterday and I already know it. Xb1
---
How in the FUCK have they not fixed the issue where placing or moving an item somehow teleports it to the floor above? I just wanted to move my stove a foot to the right damnit, now I can't even put back where it was originally either!
---
Same, usually 5-10 caps is a fair price whenever I get extra plans that I have no use for
---
It's pretty strong, i die at full health from poison like everyone else if i don't pay attention.
---
It's a straight up dice roll whether i can kill bloodied players who run serendipity.
---
I never tried NW until this score thing. I am getting better at it now. Not saying try it, but honestly whats the worst that could happen if you did give it a go? You end up enjoying it? You dont like it and avoid it still?
---
Today i had to kill one player, ended the match having killed 4 and watching a nuke kill off the rest of my team. I survived that killed two more then died in a blaze of glory, mostly because i didnt care about surviving. Ended up in third place.
---
Whitesprings station. Had a player do an animated hi to get my attention so I would stop vending and pay attention to them so they could get the vender. Slick move. Only worked once. Wait your darn turn. I promise i am quick
---
They had one, camp emote.
---
While I agree it‚Äôs silly that cola doesn‚Äôt heal limbs the way I‚Äôve got it worked out is I use favorite slots to use cola for heals and just hit H (heal key bind for PC users) to use stims when I have limb damage. This can actually be fairly useful if fighting a tough monster like imposter SS you can pop a cherry cola and stim pack to have 2 strong HoT. Def want to run the chem backpack mod with this setup tho lol
---
I just bought the communist collectron for 250 which was pretty good
---
I've got a Quad/Bash Damage/50 DR While Aiming one you can have if you want to just try one out. It's basically 20% more damage and a fair bit faster fire rate Combat Rifle with a bonus to sneak. My full health main uses an AAE and my Bloobied character uses a B2525. It's definitely the most sought after for a reason
---
But I don't think bloodied is op because of all the ways you can die easily
---
I did that one time and ended up with extra pieces sticking off my roof that I couldn't get rid of for a few months.
---
What the building mode really needs is an undo feature.
---
Yes but it‚Äôs not the same, in the quest you actually wave it around. The other one you are just planting it and standing there.
---
Its definitely a preference thing id say. I move my base and redesign it from the ground up pretty much every week. Sounds crazy to a lot of people but to me its fun.
---
Actually
---
My friend gets one almost everyday... it‚Äôs dumb, I‚Äôve still never had one drop for me... I‚Äôm the one that buys the recall cards to lmao damn RNG
---
This.
---
I carry four shotguns.
---
A quad faster fire rate pump shotgun for
---
Normal use
---
A bloody pump for big enemies
---
An explosive combat shotgun to cripple ghouls and other mobs.
---
An instigating shotgun that has a magic effect by itself for nuke zones
---
Noobies
---
WAIT...
---
Nubes
---
What does account level being reset mean? Your player level? If so, do you still have all your cards, or did they wipe your perk cards?
---
If they wiped my perk cards and recipes I wouldn't play again. Might as well buy a new account if you're going to grind again.
---
That last tiny little chunk still takes 4 weeks... lol üòÖ
---
Purified water! Build a camp with as many purifiers as possible and you can easily hit the daily vendor cap limit.
---
Ricochet is the bullet one.  Gives you a chance to take no damage from ranged attacks like serendipity does for all damage.
---
I sell all my plans for 50 caps and limit the quantities. Who wants to see quantities over 10 in a vendor when you just fast travelled across the map?
---
Check out vendor bot Chad at Camden Park. I bought 3 excavator plans from him last week. Not positive but it looked like he had all of them.
---
If you already have a good handmade you are probably set. Fixer is only slightly better.
---
Hmm...that sucks. 
---
Honestly, though, the mr fuzzy rewards suck. Once you get the outfit there is no point to using them anymore. Magazines are found all over. 
---
I wish FO76 had weekly/monthly rotating rewards for unique items from Camden Park.
---
ways you die = poison.
---
Radiation maybe, power armor pretty much negates that.
---
Fire maybe,  only one enemy does fire damage
---
Ballistic and Energy,  serendipity + all the other damage reductions
---
Melee, blocker pretty much negates that to.
---
i guess you have to run all these perks but you do get 100%+ increase in damage much more than other builds
---
Apparently alot of things are not I think if your going to do a big event like queen or encrypted its pry best to post on here for players at this point so u dont lose out
---
NICE!!
---
I saw a bunch of low levels 77, 90s double digits do the SBQ encryptid then the paradise. I jumped in to help. Not sure why but not so many high levels around anymore. I'm 225 or 228 leveled so much from xp weekend. Anywho. I used my vampires ffr gatling laser for encryptid. As long as people help turn on pylons. Hard to kill without two more pylons on. I have my shishkebab for paradise. Friendly fire for the win. And I almost forgot cryolator to freeze SBQ. My first time doing all three and not failing. Pretty proud moment for me. I'm usually the little guy trying to help with no success. But, I guess luck was on my side.
---
I wanted to ask about that. Im.noy near a river. And so I acquired the purifier on cement but it needs to be placed on "Dirt" ?
---
Tlwhat does this even mean ? So not just "on the ground" ? 
---
Can i make this "Dirt" that it has to go on ?
---
And thats why I keep all rise on me at all times

From earlier today.
---
Yea solo with a gatling laser its pretty easy, plus it gets stuck a lot in the trees.
---
Man.. I just unlocked it and was excited to just change the skin. Of course it isn't that easy. I been planning to move anyway so I assigned it as default skin through the shop. Built up a whole new camp and it didn't show up on map. 
---
lss-- I found this post a little late! Hopefully it will be fixed, now to make a whole new camp --again.
---
 The difference between the best and worst power armor is much smaller compared to normal armor, it does not make as significant difference as the numbers look like.
---
The 42% natural damage reduction does the lion's share of the work, the dr is pretty meaningless in comparison
---
Using the single hardest hitting attack in the game, a glowing super mutant behemoth's 250 damage melee hit.
---
A level 15 raider pa with it's 160 resistance will reduce the damage to \~70
---
A level 45 raider with 341 resistance will get you to \~50
---
A maxed out T-65 with it's meaty 565 will reduce it to \~45
---
That is against the attack where having the most armor makes the biggest difference, against all smaller attacks the effects are reduced significantly.
---
For a 100 damage hit (max level scorchbeasts do 95) the difference for the 3 armors breaks down to 20, 15, 13.
---
And any shared perks, buffs, or damage resistances reduce the effects even more.
---
So yes the armor has better stats, and does make an improvement over other things, but the difference is not so significant because the biggest factors in making you tanky in power armor are shared by all armor types, and make the differences that exist only a secondary factor.
---
If you take the blocker perk, which is one of the best for defense, you make it almost irrelevant what power armor you wear because there is almost 75% of the melee damage removed before the armor even factors, and when calculated out the diminishing returns hit more than twice as severe for the higher tier armors. 
---
It's better than the others, but the difference between any other good set like ultracite or t-51 is not so big as to make a huge difference.
---
üò°
---
Pretty keen to see what the "Expeditions" are going to be.
---
Actually no. More frustrated with people putting up max cap for that legendary item n expecting us to carry max caps to his cap... get real pls...
---
That's crazy high. I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life, but I price plans (except ultra rare like fixer/rad barrel/serums/bear arm) at 10% of the original value.
---
My base was north as close as I could at that bunker where SBQ people camp with max laser turrets and stuff
---
Then had people purposely drag the queen and scorched there and it kept blowing up
---
I no longer have fiber optics
---
Some pc players are mean
---
I always sell the commons i find for a cap heck some of the less rare as well now bobbles an mags materials i sell for more 
---
Just dumped a good twenty plans for recipies an pipe weapons at the overseers first camp before i jumped off this morning
---
Exactly if it won‚Äôt help me why not help out someone who doesn‚Äôt have it
---
I price everything that isn't ultra rare at 10% of listed value just to move inventory. I sell A LOT of plans.
---
gonna say  bloodied  is to easy and badly needs a nerf to either the bloodied damage or a nerf to unyielding when you can pretty much one shot a mini boss legendary have an extra 15 to every stat while honestly not being that squishy do to the number of perks that straight up let you tank like serendipity dodgy and the like  or just be pure stealth and never even have the enemy see you there has to be either a nerf to bloodied or they need to change the way xp and drops work
---
I laughed at this like I'm 12. *sigh* lol

It‚Äôs a cheat and it screws up your camp.  Don‚Äôt do it.

Thanks! I appreciate this so much.

Got pics of your CAMP?
---
Why the hell are you waving these flags?
---
Only flags you should be waving are Raider and 'please dont rip me to shreds Deathclaw' white flags
---
Aww damn :/ Thanks.
---
That one just needs flat dirt ground to place it. You want to try and get the plans for the large purifier as soon as possible because it produces much faster.
---
Ah, figured. +10STR with double radicool would be a bit overkill.
---
A two star junkies lead pipe the last time
---
Good on you. I like to go to trade menu with low level characters (to make sure it's not a mule) then dump tons of plans. My alt is desperately hurting for plans, but I got to lvl 100 on her in a single weekend, so nobody drops anything for her. This MIGHT be a dick move, but if I find camps with extraordinarily high prices, I dump as many plans as I can for free, right in front of the machine. I actually had an experience where 3 high levels, including me, saw a lowbie shopping at an overpriced camp, and we all dumped plans, stims/chems, and scrip fodder on him. He got on the mic and effusively thanked us, saying he had been searching for those plans forever, but never had the caps to buy them. Ended up just giving him 2k caps to walk around with.
---
Are you captain noob YouTube captain noob?
---
As a new player (thanks to Xbox games pass), I‚Äôm glad to hear it‚Äôs ok to use other player‚Äôs camps. When I was on my way to the Morgantown airport for the responders questline I came across a camp that spread across the entire bridge so I ‚Äúhad‚Äù to go through it, and it was set up with vendors at both ends and crafting stations along the middle. It was super impressive, at least to a new person. I‚Äôve now moved my crafting stations outside my little house so anyone walking by can use them too.
---
Yes
---
Headlamp mods for anything other than x01 are a bitch to get a hold of. 
---
Ultracite mods in general seem hard to find except the basic ones. So trying to find an Ultracite headlamp mod.. shit I might believe it if you told me they didn't exist.
---
Can I come dump some caps on you (assuming you are PS4)? My alt needs plans, BAD.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox sorry
---
Darn I'm on xb1 but would have been fun, maybe next go round when I see a nuke go off. Saw one earlier but didnt have the adhesive to craft the mini nukes. Lol
---
Saw someone lobbing a 2 shot at the SBQ the other day and was wondering if it was doing any damage, not sure if that individual was really doing any damage, but then again unless you have a god weapon and build it is a little hard to tell. I see life bar movement with my minigun which does consistent 20s on her head at 200+ fire rate, so I'm curious if it'll be noticeable with my bloodied fatman since it supposedly does 3000+ damage per shot without demo expert, at 20% or less health that is. Not sure what the damage conversion with all her dr and base damage cut will be, if it does hit it might only be for 100 to 200 or so considering my gat does about 30 to 35 per hit and does damage of around 400 or so before her resistances. I have been curious if it was possible to make a fatman feasible for that fight though.
---
You have to place it together on ground and then move it. A lot of the camp items are able to be placed better doing this actually.
---
Ok thanks.
---
Thanks anyway
---
Wow! I'm so honored to see you on here! So cool! I'm going to tell my friends! Hello! Hah!
---
XD just about to type this one, and also they put their camp in the middle of nowhere so you have just about not enough to buy it due to fast travel costs
---
This is so true. I built an open space bar (thanks to Beckett) with red rocket seats and an area where musical instruments can be played so players can chill if they want to. I always give a thumbs up when players buy stuff from my vendor machine although I don't have enough stuff to sell yet.
---
I wish it was crossplay for consoles that would make life so much simpler
---
We have no plans on trying anything now. We aren't going to cheat/exploit. Normally we stick to our private world except when the score says we need to buy/sell from a player or join a team with another player
---
Hunt them down when you are on a server with a friend. Grab the card, and then sign your alts on and grab at least two more per cargobot. 3 for the price of 1.
---
Ah shit. My whole base is kind of on a slope.
---
Any clue on the title of that video?

It is fun! I'm bloodied and nothing special. I dont sneak, I dont use power armor, and I'm not big on vats. I just like to shoot things and loot buildings while learning the lore. The best part is it adds challenge to the game. Sure I kill most things in a hit or two but I also die in one or two hits giving the enemies a chance. I appreciate the extra challenge. My set up is also for semi auto rifles but anything with a bloodied prefix I can use. Currently I'm on the hunt for a bloodied laser rifle but I've really been enjoying my bloodied shotgun and gatling gun. Bloodied is great and I hope you enjoy it, it's really a great way to try out so many weapons and keep the fear of levels 1-20 alive.
---
Haha yea thats gona cause some issues
---
It's a blueprinting glitch. Be careful who you team up with. supposedly they can drop this trash into your camp and you can't get rid of it.
---
This actually happened to me earlier today, but with a Fixer Plan that wasn't unreasonably high priced.
---
I thought it was a no Brainer because when you put down flooring, the legs are as long as they need to be to level the floor.
---
With a Vampire weapon, you can still heal yourself by shooting the robot when cloaked. Greatly helps me grab multiple pylons as I can strafe from one to another.
---
Luckily the minigun usually melts queens quick, if I can avoid the kings that is. Not going to lie I'd take 10 queens in a tiny room over a single legendary king or legendary assaultron.
---
Honestly I might be better off out of power armor sometimes when fighting either just because I move better. The pa blunts the damage, but agi at least let's me get around the attacks a little better, though emergency protocols do help a lot in the pa.
---
Not a fan of griefers here either. Once the wanted sign is up, all bets are off tho! Server hop if you cop one by accident and it's too intense to be hunted.
---
the game literally takes place in the USA
---
Holy f**k another reason to stick with a private world
---
It is lol, tried my hand at a bunch of different style videos. Now it‚Äôs more laid back gameplays while I work on some bigger projects
---
Although I am also noticing EVERY TIME I log in my character has 1 or 2 broken legs. Or I fall through the map.
---
Use Ricochet perk. Works great on PA
---
I wish more people understood this.
---
A lot of beginners are a bit shy an rightfully so i tried to do the trade thing an cant get them too but its ok i try to help best i can found one couple days ago really lost getting in over their head on deathclaw island ran in stimpacked um an whacked the deathclaw led them to the racetrack (i was building things for score) fitted them out with a couple one two star weapons i was gonna script i got from the wolf hunt made them the best armor i could with gobs of water an plans to read
---
There‚Äôs videos on how to do it, but I highly recommend not doing it at your own camp as it will screw up your camp budget permanently. Best to run them on a private server at the airport workshop because of all the flat build area. It can fit 60-65 of them comfortably probably more with some careful planning as they can‚Äôt be scrapped or moved once placed. Of course this is all speculation... not like I would personally know as I‚Äôve never done it... *yep* ...
---
Unfortunately a lot of camp items need flat ground and cant be on flooring. All the prefabs for example.
---
You can use this funky map to find where the minerals are and then scout out a new location
---

---
And what do you plan on doing about the atoms that are now sitting on a client that we don't use?
---
It's bad enough that lots of us have been losing season points periodically throughout this event, now we've been *losing* the very little atoms we can still earn too. Sure we could spend them through the client but there's a reason why people zeroed out one client and focused solely on another.
---
Still have the giant mr fuzzy doll in my inventory. Thought maybe with the introduction of the giant sheepsquatch plush they would fix the mr fuzzy to be usuable too. Nope still unusable. My fault for thinking they would actually fix something I guess. I'll just keep holding on to it for no reason.
---
I'm on Xbox. All of my plans go for 5 caps a pop and under. Camp plans,armor,weaps, most days 1 each
---
And turns out not only people from USA play it, i don't want to be "american". I want to be a raider that likes golf
---
Base helped during the 1hour bugged fight with her
---
She was supposed to fly off but got stuck and all our weps only did 1 dam due to distance
---
Ended up getting 1 star spear
---
Used personally over 10 repair kits
---
3 improved kits
---
About 100k - 200k rounds no joke.
---
Went from 1155 ~ weight
---
&lt;yes i move fast still but no sprint or FT, yes it's Wierd..... &gt;
---
Ended up with 500~ weight
---
And I had all ammo weight rrduct perks and my armor does too
---
I had mine besides the deathclaw island at the Far North East of the map, it had water and a junk extractor. And if you go down that river you‚Äôll find more resources
---
Thanks a lot mate!
---
Bethesda is aware. Nothing is going to happen to the players. Bethesda will probably fix it so you can‚Äôt blueprint those things from a workshop.
---
Always Savage Divide, has the best scenic spots with an overlook on how big and beautiful (BBW) the world of Appalachia is when you look at it from a distance.
---
We refuse to cheat or exploit the game because we feel that will just ruin it for us and others. We play alone and can make Ammo a ton after a few goes through Lucky Hole Mine and Grafton Steel. I have 7,000ish Steel Scrap and 2,000ish led from scrapping EVERYTHING metal and LHM.
---
Glad you got this sorted.  I was attempting to get traction in this matter through numerous avenues.  Hope I can get my missing atoms without having to use them in launcher.  Scared I‚Äôll do another challenge (eg create 76 molotovs - why!?) and not get credited lol
---
These are wizard
---
I think life giver only adds up max hp, but with the healing factor mutation or serum you can heal as long as you‚Äôre not starving and/or in combat
---
Depend what you are shooting at....
---
Private worlds get stale. I think that only folks in private teams can do it, so as long as you know your team mates you should be fine.
---
I think your right cause most of my support messages have been automated replies so it wouldn't surprise me if a huge chunk of people end up in suspended limbo due to a bot suspending accounts and another bot walling off appeals.
---
While I rarely have issues with camp building as I build in odd spots which involve alot of finicky placements....
---
There's nothing worse than pretty much being near finished, adding something you don't like and you go to remove it and bam. Time to start again from scratch.
---
im just saying, dont expect Albanian flags to be available given the game's setting. where you live irl doesnt matter.
---
besides, i dont throw a fit when i play a game set in japan and they don't let me dress as Uncle Sam and eat cheeseburgers.
---
Yes!  I've gotten mad and scrapped so many build concepts because I finally had something the way I wanted, then somehow scrapped the central thing.
---
I don't really know cuz raider collectron has its own setting for weapons and ammo, It really depends on what you need
---
Don‚Äôt think I have found the White spring one yet
---
The mod seems abandoned, most likely a patch between 2018 and now switched something and it's not compatible anymore.
---
Damn I scrapped a 2* Gamma Gun today.
---
Does master shotgunner increase its damage?
---
I made my camp on my main more for passerbys than for myself. Just updated it a bit today actually, first time I've done any major changes in probably 3 months.
---
It's an inn on one side, complete with small kitchen, 2 beds, and a piano for all our buffs and food requirements. Then on the other side is my shop built into a red rocket garage, not the prefab. And they are conjoined with a small central section, kind of a breezeway.
---
Just renamed and updated the sign on the shop side.
---
It reads "RAYDR MART"
---
Then below it reads "1-STOP SHOP &amp; INN" and above shop it has "WORK" written, so it could also be read as "1-STOP WORK SHOP AND INN".
---
Camp building can be very fun, and the reactions rewarding for sure. Now of we could just train the visitors to close the doors behind them, and the ally npcs. Lol
---
Was his name KronkyBoy?
---
Both backpack mods allow my build more flexibility.
---
That‚Äôs why I take it
---
I say Junkies so reliable flat damage.
---
Unless you're gonna pop 3 Formula P for the tight wet spread, then go for Junkies.
---
I have both...Junkies Ultracite and Furious GatLaser
---
I keep both.
---
Furious doesnt require a "build" per se
---
Junkies does
---
Thanks for the phone background
---
My fiance and I have found a sense of peace in the Wasteland. The other day I managed to take EVERY Workshop in the game - that was a lot of defending and retaking. I'm a gatherer of scrap, I hoard everything.
---
I think maybe they were hoping to take the workshop quickly, ORR didn't even know the shop was controlled by someone in the 1st place! I've been to workshops when spawning into the server and trying to take them almost immediately, and the other player's icon hadn't appeared yet.
---
Anything is possibly in this wacky time and world we live in!
---
Well I‚Äôm addicted to every chem so I would assume junkies but i don‚Äôt know how good furious is
---
I'm working my way through the settlers rep grind on my character that I did the raid with first, and missed out on the stealth suit... I'm probably 85% through friendly üòì I cant wait to never see ward again!
---
And put their camp on edge of mountains and you died for spawning in the air... or inside a rock texture to experience an infinity fall to the edge of universe
---
I sometimes steal fusion cores from PA that have not been collected, haha its always fun :3
---
But yeah, always check if it has the fusion cores.
---
I have a spare I'm planning on selling for plain caps.
---
I sell most for 5, want people to take them off my hands they're clogging my stash box weight. Some more high ticket ones I'll sell for 50 maybe if they seem rare or worth more money. Might have power armor station plans at maybe 200 just cause it's so expensive to buy and I want to get some returns on that. Still saving whoever gets it a good 800 caps potentially.
---
Judging by the lack of other similar posts, I think it‚Äôs just you.  /s
---
Search the sub and you'll find plenty of posts. Sorry not trying to be an ass but there are many posts with valuable information I'd only get wrong trying to quote
---
Since you seem to know what you're talking about, I'm a bit on the fence about running class freak. Is it necessary? I'm not entirely sure what mutations I'm going for and I'm wondering if the 3 extra levels would be better somewhere else.
---
the first 70 hours of playing and leveling slow was a lot of sight-seeing and picture-taking, for sure. then i maxed out my slots and have too many good pics to want to take more and delete
---
My best ever drop, that I still have is my Two Shot Dragon with 10% ADS Damage and 15% reload speed.
---
Oh that's for sure, if they do that then everyone would be expecting a flag of their country. My approach was more for the rpg element of it. Even if you play a game set in USA i would expect people roleplaying as someone from anywhere in the world, i don't need to American just for that reason. But yeah, your point was clearer than what i was "trying to say" :P
---
I currently have 14...I‚Äôve sold a few dozen others.
---
Welcome to the ever growing club. We got t-shirts and cake.
---
Lol, same. Apparently the friend of one of my year 1 friends (i don't play with him that often cause he has his own group) is a big time duper and was shocked that he didn't get banned considering he had 10,000 Christmas presents, 200 croc plans, and legacies of roughly every kind 7x. Meanwhile, I do legit trades and still get suspended XD
---
Sounds like he had a few loose screws
---
when they reply to **this** but not the thousands of bug reports.
---
Maybe 32 or 33. I don‚Äôt recall how many days I skipped, and I don‚Äôt do nuclear winter so that affects it as well. Not really too into the rewards and usually rather play something else when I have the time, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind the marine ghillie since I usually am wearing that. 
---
It‚Äôs not so bad as I made it that far without really even trying at all, but I was bothered by the continuous nuclear winter requirements. I wish it were one of the ‚Äúdo this *or* this‚Äù type of challenges as I really can‚Äôt stand NW, but oh well.
---
question- given every player character came from Vault 76, which housed "America's best and brightest" for 25 years, how would one roleplay as someone from any other country?
---
Yeeesssssss.... I have felt this pain.
---
The Lifegiver perk can give health regeneration if you have adrenal reaction and speed demon. If you have these mutations, when your HP drops below your highest health bonus, it will jump up to that bonus upon running.
---
On my stealth character with no weight reduction perks I like the faschnaut one for food, on my heavy char with a few weight reductions I like the ammo from the raider
---
I use chems and booze. Berry mentats are good for an XP/INT boost, bufftats are nice for a quick carry weight boost in a pinch and the rest sell for good caps to vendors. Nearly every type of basic booze Biv asks for for his daily is gathered by the collectron as well.
---
See idk what ultra cite mods would be for price if I still have it I'll drop it down
---
I do for sure! When i started and until like level 50 i didn't really care for the looks of it. Now that i'm done with the questlines, i run around Appalachia and damn it sure is pretty
---
LMAO the reason this game takes good hardware to run is **definitely not** because it has good graphics. It's because it's optimised like shit.
---
I've had over a dozen fixer plans drop for me now. Its becoming less rare, I haven't been able to sell my last 2 plans.
---
Oh, you moron. You absolute fool of a man.
---
Read, then write.
---
Saw a dude selling lvl 25 excavator pieces for 5000 a pop like wtf lol. Same guy was selling Fusion Cores 10 cap a 100 charge I was like just confused
---
Lmao even with a high end PC this game runs like ass. Standing in Foundation drops to 45fps
---
So shoot down another bot when you get the chance.
---
As far as I'm concerned, they can ditch automated blueprints.  Unless it's some floating monstrosity with a one foundation block base, I can never place anything that's been blueprinted anyway.
---
&gt; I can't wait until the borders of Appalachia are increased soon. 
---
I'm going to need context on what you mean here.  Where have you heard that they're expanding the game map?
---
I usually just leave it on scrap for my main character.
---
I have a low level that I'm slowly progressing 1 level a day for the score challenge, they have it set to chems/alcohol for the easy stimpaks and radaway (borderline p2w but meh, it's single player)
---
I‚Äôd love that legacy weapon!
---
Immigrants, and descendants would be my answer
---
Climb to the top of Seneca Rocks sometime. It may very well be the highest point in the game and the view is breathtaking.
---
i‚Äôm no fallout expert but you might be able to farm the power plants with and i‚Äôm honestly not sure on the heavy ammo. maybe the ammo plant up north somewhere
---
I joined my friend's world late, the SBQ just mutated when I entered the event. I was able to get a bunch of loot and legendary drop. So I don't think a player would need to be at the event in the beginning. However I always arrive early!
---
I'm constantly awed by the scenery. They did a wonderful job on that.
---
I just have rank 3 bloody mess and rank 3 one gun army one my heavy for end game battles. I don‚Äôt have starched genes on any of my builds because I learned the serum recipes I use. I don‚Äôt think class freak is worth it unless you‚Äôre farming low level areas and want to put it on temporarily.
---
Invest in a suit of excavator power armor and the scrapper perk.  Lucky hole mine has tons of lead veins that you can get 4x the yield with power armor.  Pick up every gun you can find and scrap them with scrapper equipped and you'll get a lot more steel. The perks ammosmith and super duper will also let you craft way more ammo in one go. To get fusion cores claim poseidon energy plant and power up the fusion core generator, it will be full with 3 cores after roughly 20 minutes so check back often
---
Furious' damage cap is equal to Junkies regular buff, if you already have the addictions Junkies is entirely better
---
There are no legitimate legendary power armors.
---
I'd you're in a pinch for caps go to point pleasant, take the mothman eggs, make omelets, and sell them to robo vendors. Not amazing, but it should help.
---
No power armor pieces can legitimately roll as a legendary piece.
---
No. I hunt and attack every player I come across
---
Ok I'll give this a shot. Thanks.
---
Ahh ty.
---
If you insist on using heavy guns on what sounds like your first character, i would suggest going with gatling gun and 5mm ammo. 
---
It's probably the only sustainable gun you'll have until later in the game when you start getting more fusion and plasma cores than you'll know what to do with..
---
Always use ammosmith, super duper, when crafting ammo. Some ultracite ammo is more resource efficient than regular ammo.
---
If you're on xbox i can probably spare some resources
---
&gt;Bethesda is not known for very good graphics but 76 suprised me with the reasonably high def textures and models.
---
The game looks like shit and runs like shit even on high end hardware.
---
Most underappreciated comment
---
Idk about the unyielding part I run pa and it can be challenging so maybe just nerf unyielding to like +1special for each piece would be a good idea?
---
you do realize "American" isn't a race, right? someone can have immigrated to the US and they'd still be an american despite not having been born there.
---
"American" just means you live in the US, which everyone in Fallout does (or, did. apocalypse)
---
Junkies.
---
Unfortunate.  Thats kinda dumb should be just like SS but I'm no dev.
---
If you are needing to keep up your ammo, getting a hold of the Grafton Steel Yard is a good start. It has plenty of steel resource deposits and a lead deposit. I would also recommend taking Super Duper as a perk to increase your yield if you make your own ammo. I don't use Fusion Cores so I don't have a good method for mining and holding them. As far as caps, looting enemies and selling off their weapons are a good start to keep a consistent cap stream.
---
These are what work pretty well for me but others here may have some better suggestions. Hope this helps some though.
---
This is not possible on a public team, you can only build in another players camp in a private team. There's no risk unless you join a private group.
---
Much like the fearsome yet elusive drop bears in real life. Not ever to be underestimated.
---
I'll try this. Its mostly to get some fast travel money together.
---
I want more BRC content
---
I'd recommend getting the hard bargain perk (in charisma) ranked up asap and get some decent charisma points. I have my charisma at 6 I think which is good enough for me, and with hard bargain at 3 I gain 6 caps per purified water I sell. I have 3 big water purifiers and 2 medium and can very quickly generate 100+ purified water a day. I only carry 20 on me generally cause it's pretty easy to find it about the world too, so I'm selling 500-600 caps worth of water a day generally. I also sell all my diluted chems and keep my other chems (I only use stimpaks, radx, and radaway) at 20 of each and sell the rest of those and any other chems so it's pretty easy to earn good caps that way too. Being in a team is also useful because you'll earn caps whenever they complete an event (not loads often 10-20) but can be convenient. Also you can gain around 20 caps for clearing out a workshop (the mission before claiming it) but you don't have to then claim the workshop.
---
And that's exactly what i said... what?
---
I'm still waiting to meet the elusive Responder Vendorbot in Charleston. Still believe that it's just a meme.
---
I play on PS4 and I sell every plan for dirt cheap.  I usually get bought out pretty quickly though....
---
Fallout 1st would be step in the right direction. Private server, take over Grafton Steel, Hemlock Holes, Poseidon Power Plant, Charleston Landfill, and put on Excavator PA and farm Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Don't  switch servers after farming the mine. 
---
Try using a melee weapon on low level enemies to conserve ammo. Keep to the left side of the map until you feel you have the resources to continue the more difficult areas.
---
I was sold on this game within 10 minutes of leaving vault 76 because of the scenery
---
As long as you have the max amount of addictions for DMG boost: use junkies
---
I was also told for some reason junkies ultracite and regular gatling lasers are 'magic'. Apparently junkie weapons that have a ROF over a certain amount deal more DMG then they should 
---
No idea if it's true as I havent tested it. But with the stalkers glitch/magic I dont entirely rule it out
---
"i dont want to roleplay as an american"
---
"with the game's setting and story, how would your character not be one?"
---
"immigrants"
---
"that's still american"
---
I know what I'll be doing from now on.
---
Dang! Props!!! That‚Äôs a lot of grinding!
---
Happened to me with vendors and all displays after getting killed by a ghoul while using a cooking station and then friend reviving but I was stuck with menu options and had to restart the game
---
Still better love story than Twilight.
---
No because I play on low graphics and it looks like shit
---
That's not a legacy, explosive energy weapons and double ammo weapons are legacy.
---
Most of my perk packs aimed me towards heavy weapons. I was doing fine and had a pretty stable situation, but I did some high level events and it all went so fast. The level ups were great, I'll look out for those perks.
---
I do? The whole point is that it‚Äôs annoying having to server hop for them if you launch a lot of nukes like I do.
---
Yeah, it's not amazing but if you have some decent charisma they sell okay. If not drink alcohol etc for charisma.
---
Just look up ecstacy of gold from the good, the bad, and the ugly while looking at the view, trust me.
---
Don't have the bar set, but you could try snapping them together on top of a small rug and using that to place it inside. Might work idk.
---
That sounds like a you problem to me.
---
Also  don't forget to use the scrapper, super duper, and ammo smith perk cards. As for fusion cores, if you are using them for you PA, use the power user perk card to conserve usage. There is also a perk card in intelligence that will let you sprint without using fusion cores. Stay away from using VATS when possible, its been known to drain cores also.
---
Which is why I said to make round trips.  Take one, leave the others.  Go turn it in.  Come back, get another, go turn it in...  Easy peasy
---
r/nobodyasked
---
Scorched earth is the only time I use my PA really, otherwise since I‚Äôm bloodied I die like 15 times lmao - queens melee attack is a killer
---
If you could get the assaultron cards for free do you really think they‚Äôd charge 2k for them? I don‚Äôt think so.
---
"i don't want to roleplay as an american"
---
"has Asian parents, was born in USA, therefore an "american"" 
---
"wants to roleplay as "insert asian country parents were born in" because dislikes being american"
---
Is that point really that hard? I'm done.
---
Sorry didn't mean to sound critical, was just pointing out you chose a very ammo intensive build to learn from and I'm surprised you got through the tough early grind without a problem! 
---
Quite impressive actually haha.
---
I am on Xbox. I really wanted a good farm to sustain my resources but I would appreciate some free stuff. GT: Cpl Bamboo. Thank you.
---
your right i have not needed to submit a ticket. reason being i dont dupe or knowingly except duped items...
---
CAMP on a lead deposit. Farm for acid: yao gui, crickets, snallys, deposits and junk. You use the acid for making gunpowder if you ever have to, otherwise sell bulked acid in your vendor. I get pretty stingey with my prices but i can assure itl sell for 100 caps a pop. And then as you roam around and kill things just pick up steel wherever you go weather its guns, armor, or junk. For the fusion cores you can farm the powerplants, there's resource collector that makes them. Or you can do events in the cranberry bog, they pretty reliably give you full cores.
---
I thought I was good and now I am seeing after reading this I have a new problem. 
---
I bought FO76 on steam last week. I tried logging into my Bthesda.net account to view the atoms bank and it says I need to buy the game. The steam account is linked however. Do I need to re-buy this game then on Bethesda?
---
They charge over 1k for the holotape in the bunker you get for free.
---
I‚Äôve done encryptid at least a hundred times (half the times supplied the recall card myself) trying to get Fixer plans and it‚Äôs yet to happen
---
They also charge 4k gold for the stealth armor you get for free.
---
Only 1 scavenger needs to survive.  
---
I have got max rewards tons of times with only 1 other player.  1 person defends the scavenger in the back room and the other runs ore in all 4 rooms.  Once you collect it all switch spots and don't deposit.  
---
2nd player collects all the ore from the 4 rooms and dumps it , then deposit your ore.  You never get quite enough to crack 100 between 2 people the first dash down the tunnels.
---
Then you just need to have 1 more quick run down the tunnel to grab that last few pesky ore.  We usually have the first runner go since the ore will respawn enough to get you finished. Once you hit 100 ore the event ends.
---
The real trick is to find a buddy that is on the same page with you.  
---
Good luck!!
---
Have a friend or make a friend in game and say lets kill each other in NW. Both log out to the main screen. Get on your favorite chat program or just pick a time and say log in now. If you both try and join NW at the same time 9 out of 10 times you will join the same server. Have an out of the way spot on the map picked out before hand both of you spawn in that spot, beat the shit out of each other, rinse repeat. An easy kill for both of you.
---
I didn't take it that way at all. I made it so far by making .50 ammo only. When I ran out of that I switched to an eridium G laser I got and ended up getting a little carried away.
---
Yeah this is true I just do this with the fixer and the formula p plan but I hold on to them for trades most of the time.
---
Don't forget a Free States flag.
---
I am utterly confused now and I am new to PCplay and accounts, etc...
---
Forgive me but, do i need to rebuy this game from Bethesda now? I bought this game from Steam last week. Atoms are apparently going to my bethesda account. I downloaded the launcher. Tried logging into see if my atoms were there and now it is stating from the launcher that I need to buy the game. Steam account is linked however. 
---
Am I dumb?
---
Wow dude nice shot!

Take over Poseidon energy and power up the fusion core generators. Do it on a private server if you can it's like 3 100% cores every 20ish minutes I think
---
honestly yes that point is that hard, because as i said it has nothing to do with your race or your feelings. you would literally be a united states citizen pre-apocalypse, because i cannot fathom a way they would have resided in vault 76 given Vault-Tec's huge pro-american attitude.
---
if your character hated being american that much, then they can take pleasure in the country (as well as the world) being destroyed. but that doesn't change the fact that they literally lived in and were almost certainly a citizen of the united states.
---
Or I could just spend a few hundred caps and skip that annoying process!
---
I'll see what extra I have and come find you
---
I still don't understand the the quantum grenade. It's like a troll in my opinion.
---
&gt; i don't want to be "american"
---
Might want to uninstall then since every single person who ever plays the game is a resident of Vault 76 which housed exclusively Americans.
---
I really want that sprinting card.
---
Agreed! I can‚Äôt remember a time outside of beta blueprinting a camp. Now we mold our camps to the location. I‚Äôve moved a handful of times since Beta.
---
Oh saw that. Love it but with atoms harder to come by I‚Äôm hoping for a collectron bundle or the new one for raiders at %50 when they add it back later. But now that I‚Äôm writing I‚Äôm really feel inclined to buy the communist one for free food for when they increase the buff from well fed and remove penalties from starving.
---
Same. It took several locations and builds but really love mine. Stop by. Ps4 up on the cliff near Monongah Mine
---
I don't believe I've ever been the target of a nuke since I've been down there but I have definitely been hit once, was a pain to rebuild , every other time I either packed up shop or server hopped
---
Yeah I was about to say the same thing a lot Power Armor users complained that Antivenom and Fire Lining wouldn't apply to them so that got changed but I'm glad someone beat me to it as it helps keeping the community informed
---
Bravo !
---
Did it 20+ times, still no Plan .. ever
---
Im so sad (PC)

I stop being nice guy when people keep killing off the legendary in events with their powerful guns. Period.
---
That's a great idea
---
Had kinda the same thing happen was helping a lvl 6 and 7 with armor and stims when some lvl 75 starts punching me. Me not thinking hey I run bloodied I smacked him with my gun failing to realise I'm a bloodied automatic and explosive with 90% rads so he gets a freebe then kills to two low lvls. 
---
They came back and we tore him up 10 times before he finally gave up . Never had that issue before ,but those low lvls fought their hearts out so I rewarded them big time with a bag full of pw stims food ammo and all the 1 star and 2 stars they could carry.
---
I‚Äôm sure if you put up a post on the trading reddit you will find people selling them.
---
ya ive had that happen its really a shitty thing to do.
---
i did it yesterday and there was like 5 other ppl there and everyone made sure the entire group got shots on the sheepsquatch. 
---
also a dude gave me a two shot gatling gun from it. i was so happy literally completed my heavy gun build. :)
---
No for the love of god do not get the ss pa
---
Thank you.. I just want to open a BBQ shack at my camp next to my slocom Joe's dinner and bar!
---
Yeah but if I could buy as many as I wanted for 100c each I would have thousands in stock.
---
Lol I saw that backpack too and wanted it for that single reason but can‚Äôt justify in buying the bundle for it. It‚Äôs really nice looking but camp budget maxed already plus game pass gives 10% off for all content including atoms so I can get it later if Bethesda increases camp budget. Surprised Bethesda doesn‚Äôt sell additional camp budget as folks like me who would jump back on Fallout 1st to get it.
---
I have a vampire gat laser so when I do pylons it‚Äôs beneficial to shoot him
---
Before Wastelanders, when Spruce Knob was a Workshop you could cheese a small floor/stairs combo on top of the green tower.
---
That *was* the highest point in the game.
---
My camp is on the cliffs overseeing the bog
---
Gorgeous view
---
That lawn life üëå
---
It was so hard to move off the golf course for a double resource node camp :(
---
Most ultracite PA plans are nearly worthless because of how common and easily obtained they are from the queen. The calibrated shocks mod and targeting hud are the only ones I've ever seen priced high that are actually rare. Even the jet pack isn't hard to get if you do a few Scorched Earth.
---
Ah ok very helpful thanks
---
they should reintroduce SURVIVAL mode, but this time do it RIGHT. no legendaries outside of the quest legendaries and you have to make a brand new character that cant ever go back to regular adventure mode. lower the drop rates on all the plans and mods for armor and weapons, make pvp actually worthwhile like dropping aid weapons and armor...
---
but bethesda will never do that. hackers would immediately hack in 5 star legendaries and the carebears would drop survival mode again. 
---
i hate fallout 76 without pvp in adventure mode. what the literal fuck is the point of playing the game if not to pvp?
---
These are permanent items. One is for sale in case you drop the one you have, and the other is for sale if you skipped the quest that gives it to you, and 4K is cheap for what is does. Kind of apples and oranges comparison imo. I can‚Äôt summon a cargobot every few minutes to drop me free stealth suits and silo tapes.
---
Chaps,  if you follow the overseer quest,  you'll eventually find each faction. "Joining" isn't really a thing like in fallout 4, but i won't say any more because it gets spoilery.
---
I just now got 3 star hard bargain. So im on my way  :)
---
I havw a hard time finding a vendor close to me to continually sell stuff
---
The answer will always be yes
---
idk. a lot of people say it will create an afk/ leech problem but i disagree. for the most part the community is really helpful and i think mostly everyone will still try to work together and carry their own weight. the only players that might leech are low levels which honestly i dont think would really bother anyone. and after they leeched wed still drop them the legendary loot lol.
---
It‚Äôs at the tadpole vending machine
---
I saw them spewed all over the highway one day. Stole as much as I could and ran. I was co fused because I thought the ammo factory looked different.
---
Did it?  I thought they housed the brightest and most skilled IN America.
---
I'd come dump some caps if you have stuff to sell. Pm me ur PSN?
---
At the pioneer scout camp?
---
That is correct
---
I have a fully modded out set, and have been using it for a few weeks now. So:
---
Short answer: No
---
Long answer: DR and ER have diminishing returns. So it's high DR/ER doesn't really make a difference. I would still recommend T51, or Strangler heart. They are better all around PA sets
---
Good to know I got a buddy that can have them then
---
*76
---
No you wouldn‚Äôt they weigh a pound each.
---
The clean one is a plan that you can buy with 2 tadpole badges from a tadpole vending machine. The faded one with holes in it is a vendor plan, according to the wiki these vendors sell it:   
---
* [Vendor bot Chad](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vendor_bot_Chad)
---
* [Vendor bot Responder](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vendor_bot_Responder)
---
   * [Grafton station](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grafton_station)

   * [Charleston station](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Charleston_station)
---
   * [Welch station](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Welch_station)
---
Ahhh. So in your head Elon Musk is american. Gotcha. And Albert Einstein.
---
I'm selling the Calibrated shocks to someone who offered 10k, but I usually save those for weapon trades. I'll put together a package with that, rad barrel, fixer, and some other rare mods.
---
Ahhh thank you!! I always forget the name when I have mirelurk meat and then just cook or sell it anyway.
---
I am having this issue as well. I bought this on steam last week. Got a ton of atoms. Noticed they're disappearing. Looked at posts that state they are in the Beth account. Downloaded the launcher.signed in. Linked steam account. 
---
Launched game by changing ini to 0. Beth launcher launches game and then when I sign it tells me to purchase the game. That I have bought on both Cbox and now steam.
---
I am definitely missing something.
---
Easy? Five matches in and not one kill. Waste of time, not score. Fuck NW.
---
How do I get tadpole badges?
---
I‚Äôd buy a print of that. üòÅ
---
It's maddening. No transparency on any of these issues. I've played early access shitty betas with far more communication and honesty than what we get from a AAA production company. It used to be a meme, but now it's just utterly annoying and kind of offensive. When you have things like the SBQ lock bug that was found out not to be a bug at all by data miners, but rather just a literal binary toggle for that ability, it's proof that they are both not paying attention and don't care. The people that make this game do not play it. Every update, bug and poorly conceived / executed system they implement is more than enough proof of that.
---
Then they send two or three poor correspondence people into a community like this where the feedback is tremendously valuable and they have their hands tied because they're only in place to save face rather than have any actual value to the betterment of the product. At every turn they are spitting in our face and telling us it's raining.
---
Barelt pay it any attention when I'm in the event now done it 48 time to get the plans and never once dropped. Me and my bro blew so many caps to get the event with our team and well just never happened so now we just help others and provide cover from those pesty suicide eye bots and stim ppl up.
---
sorry this happened to you! I can understand where you are coming from, I have had this happen to me during launch prep and its infuriating! The first time we tried the silo the quest broke at the reactor part and wouldn't move on so we had to give up. Like you I am also high risk from the virus and fallout is a huge part of my life now. I play online with my husband, and also a group of people I have met through fallout. I have learnt some tips and tricks over the past few months and would be happy to help you complete the silo and could show you a quick way of doing the silos if you like.
---
Does this mean I have to buy the game again or just uninstall from steam and reinstall?
---
I like that. I recently had two separate experiences that were polar opposites.
---
 One: outfitted a lowbie in full vanguard armor with an AA Hunting rifle, all fully modded. He came back later at a much higher level, and gave the stuff back, so I could give to another player. 
---
Two: made a bunch of armor and weapons for some lowbies in my house. A lvl 250 was at my machine, saw my gift emote, swooped in and insta-grabbed everything, went to the work bench, then gets on mic and says "I don't know why you dropped that crap. I scrapped it. Thanks for the materials, loser." And fast travelled away. The lowbies left before I could make a new set of gear for them.
---
I fucking wish
---
Launched game by changing ini to 0. Beth launcher launches game and then when I sign it tells me to purchase the game. That I have bought on both Xbox and now steam.
---
Einstein became a US citizen in 1940. so he is both German and American.
---
Musk became a citizen in 2002. so he is south african and american. he also lived in canada for a while, and still has citizenship there, so one could say he is canadian as well.
---
so. yes. in my head, they are american. among other things.
---
Really? Cool! I'm gonna do that when I ge... uuuh I mean cheating is bad dont do that.
---
I've mentioned this recently; I want one so bad! I was wondering if they considered it 'OP', but after this newest Raider bot, I definitely don't think that's the case. To balance out the Nukas it could also pick up junk like the paper cups, empty bottles, toy trucks and souvenir Nuka-World items. :)
---
I have all the damage mitigating perks on, including dodgy and a dense chest. I'm infact actually very difficult to kill..... But sometimes RNG is completely against me and I die in 1 hit still.
---
This X10000
---
Lol nothing like the arrogance of the Americans üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
---
Thanks, I fixed it. Funny thing though is 79 was also nothing but Americans. :P
---
It's a work in progress. Probably gonna remodel soon! Wish you could stop by and see it!
---
https://youtu.be/pZc75KwfOe0 yes it is possible, just do it!
---
how is it arrogance? they filed for citizenship, and became citizens. i also said Musk is technically still a canadian citizen as well despite being born in south africa- does that mean canadians are arrogant?
---
It really sucks since you can literally box off entire sections because not using door doesnt count as making camps inaccessible so why cant you get rid of a single floor without building a whole ring around your camp? Its super annoying and every time i try to redo a floor on my camp i have to take every piece of furniture down and rebuild it all again. They should just make it so that it notifies you that a part is inaccessible every time you exit build mode and give you an option to leave it or not.
---
So they come out of the exclusive american vaults and want to wave the american flag. And you ask how thats not arrogance?  Unbelievable
---
I wish they would do this, I am sick of taking workshops on private to be kicked off after setting them up and then everything is gone when I log back on.
---
The scrapper perk card will give you more wood and steel from scrapped weapons.
---
If you have excavator power armour visit Lucky hole mine, it's very resource rich, especially lead. (Look at every inch, you can leave there with 400 plus lead ore.
---
Bulk and sell junk your not using, and then by bulk junk you need.
---
Get a junk bot for your camp, and keep him locked.
---
Tag items you need when crafting.  They will highlight when you find them in the wild so you can learn what junk items have them.
---
Doing the tadpole missions have you joined the scouts yet
---
I've shown up to the event maybe a dozen times and got the plan twice... guess i got lucky?
---
Hey! You most definitely won‚Äôt need to rebuy this game so no worries there.
---
What will need to happen in your case is you either need to use that ini fix specified above to see your Bethesda account balance or wait until they push through another fix to migrate those atoms over to your steam client. 
---
They just stopped the underlying cause today so hopefully in the next few days they can resolve any of the leftover bits of mess caused by the issue. If this is still an issue for you in a weeks time I would suggest sending in a support ticket to help it get resolved.
---
I have had a random half wall on the 2nd floor ceiling of my camp for 2 months cause of this. I‚Äôve tried everything aside from dismantling the entire thing to get the piece removed but now it‚Äôs just gonna stay there I guess.
---
Not at all, ever since I unlocked my first set I have always wanted more. The instruments in one violent night would be perfect as it seems they already exist for players to use. And I agree they should pull a sea of thieves and have [everyones songs sync up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pKvJ2OOckE).
---
With proper planning they won't effect a build too much, but they do have impact. For example most junkies have really low charisma because of addictions which impacts vendor sales and team based skills in the game. For a 50% boost in damage it's fairly well balanced, though having addictions permanent unless otherwise kind of makes it less about the drugs. If you had to re-up your addictions periodically it might be a little more balanced for example.
---
same.

---
Ah yes, auto-stim, my favourite.
---
I love my Bog monorail CAMP as well. Workshop with multiple super mutants to the North, forest with plenty of fresh Cranberries and a fissure site to the South (very handy during the holiday Scorched event). Additionally, there's a Prime Beast bait spot right next to the Eastern wall (when the Meat Week comes along, sometimes I don't even have to leave home, except for the barbeque itself). And finally, there's a nice supply of glowing mushrooms growing under the road slightly to the West, which is also right next to the random encounter spawn point, so I meet the rare Scavenger Trader very often üòä
---
What do you play on? I have a spare laying about
---
I run that event every time it pops and I have yet to get a plan. Pseudorandom numbers FTW!
---
If you have started the Pioneer Scout quest line, they are under the World Challenges list. Finish the list of stuff under each badge to get one.
---
??? you were talking about ELON MUSK AND ALBERT EINSTEIN.
---
This is why i love games where you have the freedom to craft and build. Some people are just so creative with them and here i am with a generic box house....
---
Let‚Äôs face facts. IF it ever happened. God forbid. The first person into a vault. The very first would be America‚Äôs most tremendous. Donald trump. Closely followed by high profile trump supporters like Tomi Lahren. Geez I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen soon
---
I got the fixer plan at the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th attempt. Now I just finished mine 12th (no plan). Imposter sheepy likes me. Mama moleman does not.
---
Worked for me yesterday but I had Importance of Communication today, so dunno.
---
In a way that tells you what you need to know.
---
I feel so called out
---
Me too ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I never really got around to a retirement plan yet. This economy is pretty rough.
---
And exclusive Americans only wanting wave american flags. I gave two examples who would 100% be in and 100% not want to wave an American flag. There‚Äôs countless others.
---
Then they can just have a warning saying ‚Äúthis structure will no long be able to be blueprinted, continue?‚Äù
---
Yes!! I've thought the same thing.
---
Sounds like an up and coming entrepreneur.
---
I use proletarian. Free soups, so my hunger and thirst is not a problem, free water that I can sell, free radaway, stimpaks that I cal sell too.
---
The 250 is the wiki picture of entitled twerp
---
I was hoping that the "super comic book" would be a unique magazine. I've almost collected all of them, and I thought it'd be a cool thing to display.
---
It seems like that may have been the intention, but the item is either not set up right or wasn't added. (shrug)
---
How do you defend ORA 15 times per day?
---
1. It's an issue because it prevents you from either removing a piece you put down or preventing you from expanding more. 2. It's just a plain quality of life issue. Not to be rude but this comment sounds like this came from someone who has never experienced this issue or hasn't built anything in a C.A.M.P before.
---
I'm definitly farming this lucky hold mine after I get a fat stack of power cores from the posidion energy plant.
---
I have but they‚Äôre too heavy to buy in bulk and it‚Äôs annoying having to buy 20 or so and then do it again 2 or 3 days later.
---
I have a random encounter map that I follow
---
and they don't have to! as i said in the other comments, one can hate america and being an american all they want, but if they had US citizenship then by definition they are american, and there is no way vault tec would give spots in vault 76 to non citizens.
---
i never once said they HAD to wave an american flag, just that other flags would be readily available in the game's setting isn't likely. nobody is forcing you to wave a flag at gunpoint.
---
you aren't wrong, that's already a thing in the lore. the Enclave is just the US government, housed either offshore on an oil rig or in the Whitespring bunker. and they are always depicted as villains, so.
---
It's really upsetting that you can't display that thing. I mean... what's the point of going through all the effort to obtain a rare item if it doesn't work in the display cases?
---
Funny note: you can't display burnt magazines and comics either, even though you actually find them on display racks. :/
---
If I hit that metal plating just right she won't be walking straight for days.
---
*in
---
They only tested if bloodied builds can easily take down a mirelurk queen with a pistol.
---
You should probably leave...
---
Pffffffff hahaha
---
Nice
---
Wherever you place it it's permanent in your camp.
---
I sold my t51 set after I moved to ultracite... oops
---
Oof. I meant why would it be an issue to take the error out of the game. I had many problems woth camp building and i hate it when i cant place down an item that should be able to be placed. I am pro the meaning of this post.
---
Or when I finally found a decent, cheap 3-star last piece of Marine armour to make a matching-ish set, oops no they're gone. Damn.
---
Yooo you‚Äôre so badass
---
Ultracite is still good, just rarer mods, and more expensive repair costs
---
I thought there are no more legendary Dragons dropped anymore?
---
I got one and it didn't do anything more than a regular extractor machine. It's just a permanent fixture now so I planned where to put it knowing this.
---
quick and concise
---
I bought my way to what I wanted [like 6 levels] and since then have just been doing w/e and I'm 56 or something like that. Whatever the purple space wallpaper is. 
---
Whenever double dailies hit you'll progress a lot faster.
---
How does a random encounter map help you farm rep from Ohio River Adventures 15 times a day?
---
Ohh thank you so much
---
Yw!
---
What about x01?
---
Ohhhhhh ok. I understand what you mean now. But half the time when I get the error it's when I have a foundation block on the edge of my camp and it won't let me take it off. But I am now enlightened of the meaning of your words
---
It's a good set. High ER, respectable DR and RR
---
Mods are expensive to buy the plan for, and it has a high resource cost to craft and repair
---
It‚Äôs another button pressing simulator. They love those.
---
I didn't mean that, with ora there is a certain speach check I forgot, after your done with it you server hop than go back to him and say I want to ask you a question don't ask him one and, click I want to ask you something else and it should pop up again
---
I get how you messed up. I reread it and it totally seemed like how you interpreted it. Im gonna try to edit it to make it sound better haha
---
This is beautiful! üòç well done!
---
All good brother
---
Ok. Quick clarification, after doing the following it still states I need to buy the game. 
---
Go to fallout76.ini. Change bsteamenabled to 0. Launch and sign in with bethesda. The message appears telling me to buy full game.
---
I was under the impression I could launch the game and sign in to at least check the account. Steam still works and it looks like my atoms I have earned today are good. I think I'm just stuck on how to play through the bethesda launcher at this point.
---
Thanks for the info! Looking forward to use that tool you're developing then -))
---
I dump any mounted plans I come across at the Overseers camp or put them in a little box on my camp property that's a fixed container. I put some balloons by it so people notice it.
---
Everything else I try to sell for about 1/4 of suggested price. I guess that's too much? I dunno, people sell them for way more than i do at any rate.
---
I got it first time
---
Yeah thats what I thought, so you use the random encounter map to find raider random encounters i take it. How long does it take you to find 15 of them?
---
The junkies has 15%faster fire rate and the furious has faster reload speed
---
This is an incredible shot! This must have taken FOREVER.
---
I go through the whole map 3 times and get lucky
---
Just did it, no oroblems at all. If anything, when i got there to finish the quest i got Importance of Communication started for some reason
---
If Demolition Expert works I don't see why the Grenadier perk wouldn't
---
Figured no 1 else did so I would let some people know u think a review of the raider items would be beneficial to some been thinking about doing one
---
lmao I once sat in one of the seats and wait... and the guy was deff AFK. Waited for like 5 minutes. I finally started to take pictures with him and tried to do the photomode to immortalize the time I waited forever for a dude and of course he started to move when I took it LOL It was like when people get a pic with living statues and all of a sudden the person moves and scares them hahah
---
As long as it sells. I'm not here to fix prices. I just dislike seeing things like workbenches for hundreds of caps. Stuff that obviously exploits new players.
---
recall cards can be made? trying to do this event for my newb stealth guy but i never see it up sadly.
---
oh boy 1 is just a retooling of the existing games leveling and ones real content that may as well cause drama cause there will prob be some form of gating . So many games that provide way more my dude. Rn till then is a world boss in essence when games throw 5 at a time.
---
Fast travel or run everywhere? I'm just curious, ive spent some time farming random encounters and I found it boring, but a 10 day rep grind is better than 30+
---
Really?
---
 I just tried it at bog town and I killed the lvl 95 behemoth in seconds thank you
---
You have to craft them and then go activate the event yourself. You need stable fluxes and an assaultron recall circuit board, and I think steel too. I'd have to check to see exactly what all is needed
---
Ok im straight up rewriting my comment since it totally sounds like im defending bethesda and their crappy game flaws. Thanks for pointing my wrongness out. Im pretty tired
---
Christmas and raider are the best imo.
---
Fast traveling
---
dont do it. It will take up your camp budget and you can't get it back even when the ammo machines are gone. Some ass just glitched them in my camp yesterday
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a chance thing but it‚Äôs there most the time next to the workshop
---
And I‚Äôm still trying to find those screws
---
76 times, no pun intended. Insane!
---
Has anybody ever been to West Virginia IRL?  I'm from WV and it's breathtaking in real life.  [Here's some pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/1BH4NgJ) from my camping trip to the New River a month ago.  The location in the pictures is not too far away from White Sulphur Springs.  I've camped at Cranberry.  It's cool to see so many places I know in the game.
---
Responder bot random encounter is the only place I'm aware of.
---
Also think they introduced a vendor with wastelanders that can sell the same rare outfits as the responder bot along with the plans, I know he has the outfits, not sure about the plans.
---
have you done the sheepsquatch questline on that character
---
For me it‚Äôs been about 1:15. 48 times seems like a lot. Did you do the Lying Lowe questline before doing the event or are you just running it with friends? I‚Äôve suspected that you need to have completed the quest to get it but can‚Äôt confirm either way.
---
No DM's in PC because Bethesda think's chatting is not needed in game.
---
Used to do it, before Wastelanders, when there was nothing else to do. Walked the roads and did as much of the rivers as reasonably could.
---
Probably my most fun was running Mayor for a Day at level 4...
---
Nice!
---
Do the powering up Poseidon event. It powers up a fusion core manufacturer that creates one every 7.5 minutes.
---
The ‚Äúsuper comic‚Äù confused a lot of players when the game released. Everyone thought it was some unique comic. Nope..,just a regular mag with the same RNG as other locations. 
---
In fact it‚Äôs better to farm other locations as they are not tied to collecting those damn tokens!
---
Shouldnt need to rebuy, I know there was some intial trouble with the steam migration.
---
Could be your accounts havent quite linked up yet or your login info isnt correct. Id try to get into contact with support.
---
Sorry I couldnt help more.
---
Hey man it's all good. No hard feelings. Totally understandable and entirely relatable

Went to someones camp today who had the new Raider collectron and that thing is the closest we will get to owning an Insult Bot without actually having one. The thing was hilarious.
---
Exactly. Make your run through and exit there. It's definitely not a big deal. I'm just curious why they did it.
---
Maybe that vending machine had sentimental value or maybe he decided to fight you in order to preserve the honor of the vending machine.
---
You forgot Daily Ops (Dungeons) and Steel Dawn (questline involving the BOS‚Äôs return) for One Wasteland. Also for Fractured Steel it‚Äôs strongly hinted in one of the dev interviews that we‚Äôre &gt;leaving Appalachia in the form of repeatable expeditions in Fractured Steel&lt;. There‚Äôs also the new main questline, new companions, introduction of pets possibly, etc. We‚Äôre getting loads of content this year - with the new Wendigo Colossus public event in a couple of weeks.
---
Hahaha ok thx lol
---
What a tease. :(
---
Well either way thanks.
---
I have about every plan in the game at lvl 100, if you want it cheap search camps
---
Never heard of it affecting legendary guns with explosive effect, nor with the gauss weaponaeys inherent explosive effect
---
I'd just say try it out and see, but my guess would be no. As they aren't considered explosive weapons, but weapons in their own class that have the explosive effect
---
What console do you play on?
---
There was an issue where game pass version would not run properly if it was installed on a secondary drive. They supposedly patched it tho
---
.
---
That's what my bloodied plasma flamer was for: melting annoying people's faces. Literally kills faster than you can Nuka Cola spam.
---
To be honest, it looks like a scorched medic trying to help a fallen soldier. I am sure that he just needs a couple of stim-packs and he will be back on his feet complaining about the non-infected in no time.

Furious caps at 45% and needs to ramp up (at 9 hits), junkies is always 50% if you gave 5 addiction.

I have my camp on the road leading to Dolly Sods campgrounds and I tend to make sure my door is always open :) my friend makes fun of me for always use the shack walls and stuff even tho I have the barn build set, I feel like living in the mire it makes sense to live in a shack build home lol

Right!?

So, this settler... You're saying he's hackin' and whackin' and smackin'?

how do you start that questline?

Why would you recommend the Strangler heart and T51 over the SS? good thing as I‚Äôve been grinding for the SA
---
I almost always visit high level player camps, because often times they have done things I never though possible with their camps!
---
Well if you have a vampire explosive combat shotgun you can stay in front of the thing while shooting at it and no one will ever die. Lol
---
You don't tell... My main rig is i7 6700 + 32gb ddr4 + gtx980ti + nvme ssd and the game runs like ass, but yeah, my monitor's native resolution is 2560*1600 so it's understandable on a 5yo videocard. I bought an rtx2080super once (it turned out to be faulty after I played with it for a while and I requested a refund and returned to my older one), but it didn't do the trick, the game still lagged constantly and never have stable 60fps. I'm not really regretting it didn't work out with the newer videocard since the performance was still kinda dissappointing.
---
I‚Äôm on that spot, man what a nightmare to build.
---
Sexy
---
If I'm at a vendor or legendary machine and getting hit I go make a sandwich or have a tinkle.
---
But you can still buy all bullion stuff regardless of which side you choose.
---
I'm having issues with the Game Pass version also, but not the same one. The game crashes to desktop constantly and randomly for me. Sometimes after a few minutes of playing, some times after an hour or two. It's starting to get super annoying.   
---
Anyway, sorry I can't help you out with it. I just wanted to vent.
---
Not only do we need more, but we need portable ones, rather than being bound to a camp and a chair, let us carry instruments around in our weapon slots and rip them out for some impromptu jamming sessions. Imagine fighting the scorchbeast queen with a full orchestra playing in the background.
---
I stupidly missed the Fasnacht one. üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Start by looking up if there is already a video, If not, make one
---
Yes. I‚Äôve been in 3 or 4 matches with him this weekend and this is accurate. He knows where you are.
---
All these tips are terrible, with the exception of the guy suggesting Excavator armor and Lucky Hole Mine. That is good advice. Further advice:
---
* Get the Scrapper perk, clear out West-Tek, collect EVERY gun from the Supermutants and scrap them for ~600 steel scrap.  
---
* Farm Snallygasters at Toxic Larry's and the Sunken Trainyard for acid, which you'll need to smelt iron and lead ore. Tanagra Town also has a Cave Cricket nest for acid.  
---
* Hornwright Test Site 3 and the surrounding area has a TON of iron deposits. Chuck on your Excavator armor and go mining. Those deposits alone can give you over 1,000 steel scrap when smelted.   
---
* Do not waste your time with resource extractors. People always say "dude camp near a lead node" or "dude take Hemlock Holes" and they're always wrong. Ditto power plants; fusion cores are abundant, just farm Sentry Bots and do Line in the Sand and other Brotherhood events/dailies.   
---
* If you're running low on screws, you can easily craft screws by making Assaultron helmets with Super Duper equipped.  
---
Hope this helps!
---
Last time I checked there was not any videos. Only ones I found were videos showcasing the outfit.
---
Yes as in all seasons will be free?
---
On the topic of the bag, did you not get the replacement?
---
Congrats. Over time you'll find ways to make it easier and will be running 3 silos a play session!
---
Vats is bugged and this bs needs to be fixed along adrenalin and the other 20,000 bugs in this game smh how did bethesda make this game?
---
This giving me some monster hunter vibes. Nice shot bro
---
Oh haha thanks, I did not know that :D
---
Yes I would. The T65 SS power armor is awesome looking. It's an aesthetically pleasing power armor set. But it's high DR and ER, it's one advantage, is really a minimal advantage. T51 is the best overall (besides T65) in DR, ER, and RR. Its mods are easy to obtain, and its cheaper to craft and repair. 
---
Strangler heart has the best RR of any PA, and respectable DR and ER. But its expensive to craft, needing vault steel as well, and repair as its Ultracite power armor. Its main advantage is its 'legendary' set effect. Which is acid damage, and an acid aura. Its mods are also extremely rare/expensive
---
Take the position of Vault 76 and mirror it, so somewhere in the Mire or the Bog slightly southeast of the center of the map. Saves on fast travel costs because you can travel to your camp and Vault 76 for free.
---
Even if bethesda said it will always be free I don't believe anything until it's upon us. There was supposed to never be pay to win... We have repair kits and collectrons now... The raider one gives some amazing chems. Payed for chems.
---
They already confirmed it will all be free yes. They said fallout first members may have extra benefits but everyone will have access to the same thing.
---
I like having a camp in the south/east-ish part of the map. It gives you a good anchor for free fast travel, as 76 is kind of centered/west.
---
Why there isn't a mouth harp in my camp is insane. Only instrument I like.
---
Especially with all the new players flooding in, I‚Äôm sure it would benefit someone.
---
Go to a Nuke zone, gather unstable flux from mutated flora and kill enemies to get Hardened Mass, High-Radiation Fluids, and Glowing Mass to turn the unstable flux into stable flux. Easy peasy.
---
Master infiltrator is essential QOL. Even rank 1 means no more swapping perks around. Anyone want to see a hunter/gatherer one that combines green thumb and butchers bounty for the same deal?
---
Yeah just figured this out today when I moved my camp because I couldn't change the skin. Only to find out after I built a whole new camp that I couldn't even see it / fast travel. What a waste!
---
Behind closed bedroom doors with an established safe word, water to stay hydrated and flavored lube.
---
I used to use gatling for ammo conservation but I switched to UGL. Power user makes it too easy and I get nuclear waste for plasma cores.
---
So.. Buying Atoms works, and seems to fix the problem because after I brought the atoms I completed kill 76 Aquatic creatures and I got my 40 Atoms! However I DID NOT get the other 325 Atoms I had Earned over the last week. 
---
Still no word from Bethesda.
---
Not exactly cause it's hard to find the mass things thus is why i had asked for some pure flux already.
---
There is a secret passage hidden in a wall behind vines! It's hard to describe the exact location but I'm sure there's a YouTube video for it as well.  
---
My method is to kill all of the cultist first, and then use the excavator power armour to get double resources.
---
If you clear it dry, you'll easily have 5000 plus rounds of ammo after converting and crafting.
---
Dont forget to maximize ammo gains with ammo crafter perk and super duper which has a chance to duplicate crafted item.
---
Super duper is a must have perk for ammo, food, and chem crafting.
---
Bloodied is the highest DPS, but its heavily specialized in how its played and equipped
---
Junkies is better all around as you gain a good damage boost, with minimal downsides and not needing to specialize as much in equipment or play style
---
Anything else really doesnt touch the two
---
I think the ss pa looks kinda gross because it makes your character looks so chunky but I like the helmet
---
Disable pacifist on both of your characters, then engage in pvp. 
---
She tags you, then you tag her back, then you can kill her sloth. 
---
Remember to turn pacifist back on, after you are done.
---
Lead is smelted through the chemistry bench, not scrapped. Look under misc, you should have ore that you can smelt. Requires acid to do so.
---
I run Melee 80-90% of the time to conserve ammo.  The 15 strength I have allows me to carry all the junk I find and boosts my Melee damage.  I only really use guns on flying enemy especially scorched beast.
---
I actually enjoy how tanky/chunky it is
---
Even though I'm not a fan of the current power armor system fallout 4 introduced, I always was a fan of power armor looking tanky and large
---
This is good to do if you're a fallout 1st member and want to leave the game running in the background while in a private server and doing something else like homework or cleaning.
---
Let hope it stays that way, thanks!
---
Unfortunately i only found out about the bag replacement about 2 weeks after the cut off date they gave to claim replacements :(
---
If you can‚Äôt be bothered with messing around like I can‚Äôt with junkies and bloodied  then a furious rapid fire.
---
I use a furious explosive 50cal. 
---
Can do the SBQ, solo silos and have no issues with anything I meet.
---
Down side is I sometimes kill myself with the explosive effect
---
Edit;
---

---
Every post I see of this I will reiterate my method that has been flawless and have been compiled from others who suggested the same. I have yet to have a single autocomplete situation (and used to have them a lot with atoms). Do these thing:
---
When ending a game session end it in adventure. Do not end it in NW.
---
End your session no later than 1130am est
---
Do not start your next gaming session until 1230pm est.
---
Do not go into any other section of the menu except adventure mode. Do not check the atom store. Do not check the game board. Do not check your social menu. First log after reset (which is 12pm est) go straight to adventure.
---
Complete the dailies but do not do NW until the very end.
---
This all could be a lucky rabbits foot but has worked
---
I would be interested in more info about this grind
---
Go to the main door and enter, run downstairs, hang a right,  and look for the Responder bot metchant. He has most of them.
---
Fantastic
---
And throw a mine in front of the pa... Can run from it as you load into it without the core!
---
Mr fuzzy Tokens and the rewards are a joke. The mr fuzzy outfit can be easily obtain, especially if you run all 5 characters.
---
And it‚Äôs not worth the time.
---
Solid advice, thanks. I didn't realize Better Crit worked that way and I think I'm gonna do exactly what you're recommending. As far as CHR goes yep I have perks I swap in when doing public teams. Didn't know Empath did that though so that's great to know!
---
I most likely have backups of all of these. If you have discord message me: Eckserah#0001
---
Would be nice tho.
---
Check player vendors, people are always selling stable flux.
---
Im one of the lucky hole mine guys.
---
I would only suggest holding a resource site IF OP has fallout 1st and claims 5 or 6 sites to leave running for a few hours while they periodically check in, do other stuff like rebuilding their base, or possibly even let the game run while doing other stuff.
---
The backpack you get from completing tadpole challenges gives you a standard backpack. There is a smaller one you can get the plans from the airport in Morgantown and its half the size of the standard backpack. There are also possum badges you can earn after you've gotten your tadpole ones completed to obtain a high capacity backpack mod which doubles the storage. Storage amount also changes based on what level you craft it at so if you make one below level 50 make sure to craft a new one with your level for best gains
---
Same. Very annoying
---
Ok i can try to find some like that the one downfall is how much they can sell it for.
---
&gt;Im one of the lucky hole mine guys.
---
Good man.
---
This is the only way.
---
&gt;Glitch bones
---
I can't help but think if you're going to do that, you may as well just go the whole hog and do the full Rocksy glitch and finish the entire grind in an hour. 
---
They're both exploits, just one is an exploit that still costs you a lot of time and effort it seems. 
---
Shrug.
---
I think they are definitely pushing the boundaries with what they themselves have said, in saying that if it stays the way it is now and they don't push any cash grabs further ill be happy enough. I was pretty salty at first with FO 1st and the unlimited scrap but im kinda over it.
---
With the collectrons, I certainly see where your coming from, since they went against their word by adding cash items that arent just cosmetic anymore, but it gives me something to save my atoms for I suppose, I'm not ecstatic about it, but I can live with it as long as they don't push those type of items any harder lol.
---
That worked, thank you. Not only that but since we were at it I went ahead and finished her off and got a handful of atoms and the platinum trophy. Thanks.
---
I'd rather earn it sure I'm still exploiting but I did something instead of clicking dialogue over and over
---
For my main I have it set to scrap. 
---
My second character is a junkie‚Äôs build, so I have it set to chems and booze.
---
I'd suggest claiming a workshop for those challenges in the future. You'll save resources and if shit like this happens, you don't have to worry about trying to fix it.
---
Ok I'll look for it when I'm on
---
YES a million times
---
That's a pretty fine semantics line you're walking there. But you do you I guess.
---
Save a blueprint of it and then place the blueprint. It's annoying, but it works.
---
find the fallout76 executable and create a shortcut to your desktop, this is presuming it runs from opening the file in that location, i‚Äôd say the shortcut is broken
---
In between weekly lucky hole runs, OP can top off lead by grabbing hanging can chimes (Camden park is about 40 cans while you grind fuzzy tokens) and do breach &amp; clear, and the event where the mine collapses when it is available.
---
Congrats mate, it was a helluva grind
---
Speculation is that they are going to release a DLC that will add a new area to the map. It was alluded to during an interview with one of the lead developers I believe. Now, whether that could mean in the form of a changed and expanded map or you travel to a different area remains to be seen.
---
Maybe players he is being aggressive and abusive towards need to report him then and he might get a ban.
---
The SBQ slowly regenerates health while in the blast zone. Once when we fought her north of the blastzone on thet buker she just flew away into the zone for 2 ore 3 minutes And regeneratet from around 95% after being mutatet bach to 100%.
---
I just finished this event, it popped as soon as I went to the plant to claim it.
---
Does anyone know what this outfit is? Its on one of the raiders at crater and is exactly what I'm talking about - a wastelandy dress. https://i.imgur.com/iEkqRDZ.png
---
There is a new vault raid that seems to be on the horizon
---
But who knows, maybe the 94 raid will come back into circulation eventually
---
Im between 30-40 runs never gotten it as a drop. That event is fedoras and every 8-10th time was an outfit piece.
---
Same. GTX 950 for the fail üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I recently relocated my camp to a bit below Morgantown. 
---
I like to sell plans around 10% of suggested price and I make some high level type weapons (like handmade and powerfist) at the lowest level and sell those fairly cheap. 
---
So I wanted to be near where lower levels might happen by.
---
Really? I much preferred you having to climb into the pa. For me it solidified the feeling of being a walking tank. It isnt really the chunkyness apart from the knees which look bloated but I liked the curves on the power armour and the flat bits really annoy me.
---
Long old slog 
---
The worst part is, I'm about a tenth of the final rep bar away from ally with the Settlers, and yet I know it's still going to take about a week or more. 
---
The horror.
---
I also only use pa but it's like 3000 gold so idk if it's worth all the grinding
---
What are you going to do now?
---
Why do this when there is an ammo generator camp item you can buy from raiders after completing wastelanders?
---
Let me know when you‚Äôre done and I‚Äôll raise a toast to your dedication!
---
Have done it about 20 times no luck.
---
I however did buy it a player vendor for 1,500 caps last week.
---
I assume it was dupped at that stupid low price but I don't care, it was one plan I used quickly that didn't get me in trouble/banned.
---
I've seen them between 10K and 30K in player vendors outside of that steal I found last week.
---
What got me was the sounds. I remember my very first cabin I built under some trees. The sound of the wind blowing through the trees, the cicadas screaming in the distance, my wind chimes lightly tingling along, and my radio playing in the background. I was so comfortable that I sat my character down in a rocking chair and used my game as low key background noise. Been in love with the environment ever since.
---
If you don‚Äôt have anyone to help, you could just tame a passive animal like a cat or rabbit and it‚Äôll replace the sloth.  
---
Option 3 would move to a high traffic area where enemies spawn.  
---
Haven‚Äôt really tested this too much as I don‚Äôt want to lose my pet Pinchy (Mirelurk Hunter), after losing Poochy (dog) to mysterious causes.
---
I then copied the game from steam to the beth launcher and tried and no avail.
---
Pretty damn frustrating and really all I wanna do is spend those atoms real quick.
---
I am guessing I'll have to wait.
---
I can build every piece for both, what pieces do you need?
---
That I will. Those bottoms will be up in the most non sexual way I can manage. 
---
Failing that, the bottoms will just be up, to hell with the innuendo.
---
This kind of want to makes me rebuild my camp. I mean I like my camp but it was my first attempt at making a nice one...I think I could do better. Having atoms helps too...also those expensive whitesprings decorations, kind of wanted to go for a victorian/modern type thing. I know, I know, it's the wasteland, doesn't mean someone can't build something nice!
---
I just wish you got more building budget, would legit pay for that, come on Todd I know you want my USD!
---
I kind of thought that was the purpose of the personal terminal, but you know I'm not sure what the purpose was it keeps taking me to a quest NPC whose quest line I've already finished too.
---
Good luck on your bigger projects man, I hope I can logistically get started on one of my bigger projects one day so you have my envy haha
---
The gauss minigun. He came. He saw. He bought.
---
Bloodied is king of damage, naturally, and emergency protocols+power armor makes you quite tanky.
---
Junkies is best damage while maintaining full health.
---
Two-shot is not good.
---
Furious is a decent choice since many heavy weapons have high ROF and magazine capacity, you reach your full damage stack reasonably fast.... but I've never been a fan of furious since the stack is on the TARGET, not on YOU, so anytime you hit something else it resets the stack.
---
Anti-armor is a solid all-arounder if you don't want to deal with junkies. 
---
Go with ballistics; energy weapons are just... ehhhh. I use a few every now and then to burn off cores I've found but there's multiple reasons I don't like them.
---
Gatling Gun is king of ammo efficiency, and is very accurate to boot.
---
50cal is a very solid high DPS boss/swarm weapon. Accuracy isn't great, ammo usage is average, dps is high. Also a \*very\* durable weapon- needs repairs rarely.
---
minigun has great accuracy but buuuuurns through ammo. DPS is debateably better than 50cal but it's very circumstantial, and you'll be using up more than twice as much ammo and repairing that much more often. Spin-up mechanic is a weakness on anything but bosses/hordes.
---
LMG has the highest DPS but the EXPENSIVE ammo and small capacity keep it fairly balanced. Also kicks like a mule- best used in short bursts or up close, or you'll be missing most of your shots by round 10.
---
The rest of the guns are much more situational or just flavor... harpoon gun is primarily used as a shotgun but it's 1shot nature and slow reload make it more for fun than anything. Broadsider is trash, just don't. So many reasons just don't. Cryolater is just used for freezing. Flamer does good DPS but fuel is still rare/expensive, range is short. AND WHY THE HELL ISN'T IT AOE? Flamer is so sad.
---
Well, the wife gave me Resident Evil 2, Vampyr, and The Division 2 so I‚Äôve got that to explore.
---
Read the Sheepsquatch Ate My Brother poster at any train station.
---
Yeah it's not like Rust where people blow up your base just because they can, or you moved in too close to them. If it was people wouldn't put much effort into their shit, but it would add a huge sense of danger to it.
---
I guess it used to be more of a thing since I see a perk to do more damage to workshop structures though?
---
Not sure of the effects, as I've done it twice and picked the same both times. It's pretty evident if you have the stats to examine the brains closely as you go. 
---
I picked &gt;!the depressed chick, as once she's in her new metal housing, you can then adjust her dopamine etc levels and make her no longer sad. She's implied to be the smartest!&lt;
---
I'm not sure if there are ramifications of your choice overall though from picking something else.
---
If I remember correctly, the sad brain is the better one since she discovered a flaw with the turrets and can shut them down, but it ultimately doesn't matter.
---
What‚Äôs your thought on Gauss Minigun?
---
Vampire's and Suppressor's effects still work while it's invisible
---
Glad to see no one screeching about how you shouldn't be paying for a buggy game. I just got FO1 since you get atoms with it and I haven't really bought much of anything, waiting for something to really catch my eye.
---
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm headed right now.
---
I feel your pain. I think some people are just super lucky. I had to buy fixer plan so I knew it. I'm relatively new but have over 20 runs and dont even have the imposter outfit yet either!
---
To add damage to that, I accidentally scraped my regular sheepsquatch outfit and helmet I got my first run on it and paid 3000 caps at a player vendor to replace both haha. (They are now favorited items to avoid my stupid speed scrapping)
---
The gauss minigun has splash damage I think it‚Äôs classed as explosive
---
Yes, a well performing, synergetic build should be nerfed and join the ranks of two shot and explosive in the "remember when they were good?" category. Infact the game should aspire to awesome prefixes like ghoul slayers, assassins and bashing - cause why the fuck not.
---
well... yeah. There's a reason the decon shower is considered an endgame item (hell it used to only drop from the queen). If you want to be the generous god giving them to lowbies... you gotta pay the requirements for it.
---
Wish we could send messages to people on PC, or is there a way?
---
Just complete the stuff and we will ignore all the innuendo.
---
Get over it...
---
Same boat as you, I bought it at a player vendor just to mark it off the list.
---
I'm sure I'll eventually get one legit, but I wanted it in the RNG pool for me sooner than later so I have the chance at a legit good legendary fixer drop at some point in the future.
---
(Tubas aren‚Äôt even wind instruments, they‚Äôre brass, the plans-naming team did not google this)
---
What's bugging me most is how Bethesda is handling it. No communication at all. Like, tell us ffs! You're suspended 2 weeks. Or until patch 21. Or you're banned. Tell us something! It's like they have no respect for any of us whether we broke their rules or not. It's gross tbh. I started a new account to see if I could stomach starting from scratch if they character wipe me. The answer is a resounding no. I put way too much time, effort, money, and of myself into that account. I can't do that again. So if I get a total wipe or banned it's essentially the same thing to me. I can bounce back from an inventory wipe as long as they don't make me forget the plans I learned, but I'm not grinding out all those Secret Service armor plans again. Bump that noise. I had just finished buying and learning the last piece.
---
It's too late. 
---
I'm in too deep.
---
 &amp;nbsp;
---
^^^Ok ^^^now ^^^I'm ^^^done
---
I particularly like the view from the top of the monorail elevator.
---
I've claimed Hemlock 3 separate times in the past week and I've gathered about 600 acid from it, and I don't even check it that frequently. I agree with your other tips, but I'm not sure why you would try to dissuade anyone from such an easy and plentiful source of acid.
---
Edit: to expand a bit more on this, I don't have Fallout 1st so I always play on public servers, and I can't remember the last time someone stole a workshop from me. I also place signs encouraging others to take from the extractors, since they cap at 10 items and won't continue extracting until emptied. Locking your extractors, on the other hand, will definitely incentivize people to claim it. I choose to interpret it as a balance of respect: I respect other players by sharing my resources, and they respect me by not claiming the workshop.
---
As for caps, OP, I recommend clearing out Fort Defiance. You can find straight jackets all over the place, and with rank 3 Hard Bargain and Grape Mentats each one will sell for 50 caps. You can get most of your daily 1400 caps from that alone. There's also a hell of a lot of resources. Every time I do a full Defiance clear I walk away with about ~300 steel and plastic, ~70 screws, ~50 springs and acid, and a bunch of other components.
---
I liked the frame idea, what I had a gripe with was:
---
-A power armor set should be just that, a set. No mix or matching. Every set of power armor is much different than the other in the way its powered and operated. Every set was a uniquely developed set, and just ripping off an arm to attach it to another set wouldnt work unless your character was smarter than the entire, Wes Tek R&amp;D division, United States engineering corps, and the Enclave R&amp;D team 
---
-The lack of training. In previous fallout games not just anyone could use power armor. Operating power armor put immense strain on the body due to its weight. It's also advanced technology and I doubt Piper or any random Vault 76 inhabitant can just jump into it and use it like a veteren Power Armor division could
---
-The fusion core system. They basically threw the lore of the power armor sets having unique and different powering methods. T45 was powered by fusion packs. The T51 by microfusion packs, the Enclave X01 was powered by a *nuclear fission reactor*.  It was just a slap in the face
---
Those are my biggest gripes with the implementation. There's some smaller ones too, but they are mostly really opinionated
---
Rinse, repeat, you'll get there.
---
There's no downside to it and it's a free fast travel location. Plus at a low level there isn't much that can't be repaired with super common materials if you do run into a griefer which is already very rare. Also worth noting, if you don't have a vendor attached to a power source your camp won't show up on the world map so unless a griefer stumbles upon it through exploration they'll have no idea it's there
---
That‚Äôs the spirit
---
Don't worry about it, starting in October you're not going to have the time nor the energy to play video games any more :)
---
They said they made a fix so that the atoms award correctly, but haven't said anything about the ones that are now on the other client.
---
Add bSteamEnabled=0 (1 enables steam again or just remove it) In your Fallout76custom.ini to check and see if your missing atoms are on the bethesda client.
---
I have both and Bloodied is way better and not really close.
---
Low HP with nerd rage, emergency protocols, ricochet, dodgy along with AP boost make taking damage at 20% a non issue.
---
Then add on a Bloody one hand or two hand melee not specd it still does enough to one shot most.
---
Junkies melee turns out about equal to instigating on most things since we one or two shot everything
---
Junkies misses adrenaline where bloodied doesn't need it.
---
I do enjoy playing my Junkies character more though  for whatever reasons.
---
I don‚Äôt have enough bourbon for this.
---
Yea all my words are on the back of having paid for first since day one and buy 96% of what the atom store offers. But their words fall on deaf ears. I hope for it to stay free and maybe add another layer of things to win for 1sters but I only believe what I see with them now
---
Its classed as an energy heavy weapon, but since it has explosive splash damage like its counterparts it is affected by demo expert
---
But it's a stretch to say it be affected by grenadier. Just due to it not being classed as an actual explosive weapon. Like the two grenade launchers, missile launcher, fatman, etc
---
Ahh yeah I forgot about the two Bullion weapons.
---
Gauss minigun does fantastic DPS but the better mods reduce the range considerably (120 range! 50cal is 204!). Ammo is crafted in much smaller quantities than for other guns, but doesn't require gunpowder, so that's a plus? innate explosive effect is kind of nice. Spin-up can be annoying, but has great ammo capacity. Those very cool blue streaks of fire while you're firing it... can make it kind of hard to see your targets.
---
Plasma caster has a small mag capacity, but outside of that is like a much upgraded gatling gun.... except the ammo is rare/expensive. But it's very accurate and VERY high damage with a decent fire rate. But shares one of energy weapon's problems- enemies turned into plasma goo. Plasma goo and laser ash both are super buggy and problematic and can cause issues with looting.

Will valentines day skins be added to this?
---
The Wastelanders update placed a tent and fire pit with chairs out my back door just outside my build area. I love how completely natural it looks.
---
sure but you will get to max rep faster with the side you choose as you get bonus rep from doing so.
---
Also like i said there's a gun you get from raider quest line toy miss out in if you go settler
---
NICE SHOT!!
---
People can build a 5 story tower that hovers over a mountainside,  that's supported by a single staircase attached to a wooden floor and that's A-ok, but if I try and place a support pillar on a foundation... that's where the game draws the line.
---
I helped a buddy run his first nuke (we were both about level 70ish on our first runs) and was so sad to see the quest complete for me because we were teamed up. 
---
We didn't know only one person could launch, so he input his and I was left there to take his picture for him at the launch haha.
---
I died a little inside though, it was a bummer having my cherry nuke complete without running it.
---
Tbh  that's my only complaint about public teams now.. alot of new players are going to have it complete when a team member launches one.
---
I have 8 nukes launched because of this bad first misunderstanding, and teammate's launching them.
---
None of them are mine though, haven't had the motivation to since my first time was ruined as well like you lol.
---
You're not gonna be as powerful as regular bloodied auto, rifle, or heavy builds
---
But it's still a doable build. You're just gonna be sacrificing some survivability for a DMG increase. Even though your max DMG, while high per shot with the gauss pistol, is not comparable in DPS
---
Pistols have always been underpowered, just like 1 handed melee and pure explosive weapons.
---
It's all luck. I was vanguard build and rolled a lot of unyielding. After mumbles gave me a blooded handmade I decided to make the switch and all those unyielding pieces I put in the scrip bin I regret as it's been weeks and not a single unyielding
---
Depends on what you want in a build. But I think you covered the main points
---
You only get 1 raider daily each day... thus daily... the exception is the very first time you unlock them.
---
Cowl bell and a harmonica please
---
Sorry to hear that. But the best course of action is to just move on. Nothing you can really do now, but to get back into the fray
---
I saw "flux". Thought of Trove
---
Noticed too it's steam rank is "mostly positive" which is a world away from where we were.
---
this is a bug, but it's been around since game launch, so who knows if they ever fix it
---
I have to say, with all the slack the game gets for all its bugs ect, one thing that Bethesda really got right in 76 was the map design.
---
Alright thanks
---
While I wholeheartedly agree, I'm not sure the simulation will allow for that. Once someone manages to break free, however, we'll be able to travel wherever we'd like to.
---
We got it, thank you.
---
Those legs. Ewww...
---
Well it's not that I'm not willing to pay it's just my caps they are going to hurt ya know?
---
Too bad your not on PC
---
Playstation problem.
---
I'm on xb1.  Any veteran with 100s of plans knows the deal, they wont sell unless their cheap.
---
Only lower levels or stingy idiots who are going to have ZERO stash place try to sell plans full price.
---
Only exception is really rare plans.
---
What exactly is your problem with SS armor? I don't get what you mean by " there is no way I will give up AP regen for extra armour protection. "
---
"rifles" were really the bows. But rifles got the fixer a long time ago. There hadn't been new pistols/shotguns/heavy weapons since game launch, so....
---
I don't know if getting a vpn would work, but that would be more expensive. I did the 12 month, simply because it was a better value, and I don't like recurring bills. Legally and ethically questionable, you could go halvsies with a friend; just don't ever log on at the same time
---
Yes, you will not be as powerful but at some point you want to hane fun too. My second character is a bloodied slinger and I haven't played my "main" since.  I love it. Give me a few min and I can share my build.
---
You didn't back up a GAME FILE before you deleleted it? loooooool. 
---
Yeah you're going to have to reinstall.
---
The spawn points at camps could be better. Every time during an instance I travel to my camp the first time, it loads me inside a wall. For others too. You have to fast travel to it a second time and then it will  load you up at the other end of the camp.
---
I'd like a "land here" marker we could place that would only show up in build mode. It would help a lot with camps on cliffs too. I've spawned inside the map on those more often than not. And recently, my  spawn point was inside someone's locked building. I'm sure they were just as surprised as I was.
---
you could do a glitch in the game and get max raiders rep in 10 minutes
---
Cool story bro.
---
Endgame is definitely building! I too enjoy watching players explore my CAMP and using my Workshop. It only becomes annoying when I have to wait to use my own bench! ü§£
---
I love to build and hate to tear stuff down unless it doesn‚Äôt work. To that end I have 5 different characters, with 5 different builds and 5 totally different CAMP styles. I‚Äôm on PC, IGN Jazdia, so please drop by!
---
I‚Äôm a true ‚Äúglutton for punishment‚Äù.
---
I agree, but also i think that appalachia is such a huge map that they can easily just fill it with tons of new content and characters with stories. Morgantown airport needs a massive round 2 battle, responders fight back to take back the airport from the scorched.
---
Np.  Just wanted to let others know too as I think pet taming is an under appreciated and not well known aspect in the game.  
---
I just wish you could interact with them somehow.  Even just a basic heart emoji to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home‚Äù
---
Edit:  on the subject of frogs - I wish we had a proper terrarium to display them.  Having them squished inside a mason jar inside very...humane lol
---
And they always leave the doors open. I feel like I'm their mother, following them around closing doors. How hard would it have been to have them close the door behind them if no one else is right next to them?
---
.... I mean, even if she can't see you, the sound (and muzzle flash) of your gun will definitely give away your location... so yeah.
---
I'm not rushing those... or activily doing them daily..They're painfully boring (how many times must I grab 3 fuses and kill the same ex raider, its lame as shit) and what will I have to look forward to after them? Some new stupid grind from the BoS release at the end of it that takes 100 hours like these? Good on you but I'm not that dedicated.
---
True, but there is a common misconception with players, where they think when you side with one you're locked out of progressing with rep of the other. 
---
The only REAL benefit of siding with the raiders over the settlers, to my knowledge, is getting the slugbuster gun from the one mission. If I'm missing anything, about siding with one over the other, please let me know, since I haven't completed the main wastelanders questline.
---
I picked them all, they all work. Gina is pretty cool.. Mostly just different commentary from your companion
---
Yeah this happened to me and I messaged him and waited a few hours and fell asleep and woke up and he said he sold it smh
---
If you accidentally buy a duplicate its useless so you have to grind for another week to replace it. That's how. The end game content is horrible.
---
I couldnt find this encounter online, do you happen to have a link for more info?
---
I‚Äôm stuck on this too!
---
Yeah the price it gives you means absolutely nothing in game. Sometimes it's way too high others too low. For plans, there are only a.handful that are actually worth a lot and they usually take active event or random encounter grinding. I price most of my plans and 25-50, weapon plans will tend to go for 1-200 since they are more uncommon. And rare plans I'll sell anywhere from 100-2000 depending on the plan. 
---
Stuff to look for: healing salves, disease cures, chems, power armor, rare outfits and event rewards like sheepsquatch stuff.
---
nothin but pain
---
i‚Äôm Level 87 started a couple months ago
---
I have a bloodied stealth guerrilla‚Äîauto pistols. It‚Äôs a bit of a compromise build, especially now that I tweaked it to max INT and be a SCORE grinder, but it‚Äôs a lot of fun. 
---
Not as much damage as a stealth commando for sure, but I can still mop up most things with a headshot, a mag or two for Scorchbeasts and bigger creatures. I‚Äôm not going to solo a SBQ with it, but I don‚Äôt need to either. 
---
The damage on my bloodied stealth commando is great, but it‚Äôs getting boring, especially with more active group events. It‚Äôs becoming an easy button for the game and I feel rude if I show up and start killing everything in one shot at most events. I‚Äôll still use it for solo stuff, but the guerrilla is a lot more fun with the way the game is shaping up.
---
Bog maps can give you t60 pa plans which are pretty rare, and only drop off those and bog events.  They are a decent source of caps but it‚Äôs not hard to make caps at high level so I guess it‚Äôs about the plans.
---
Here is my [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=36918fe&amp;d=p02ej4a32l71lk2lv2pb2ad2ak2al2e52ce0l12ar2ir2la2sg2eu0ic4&amp;m=51c2feb3&amp;n=girl)
---
I use a western revolver as my main. I one shot most things. I use a 10mm or laser pistol as backup.
---
PA does need buffs, primarily in carry weight and a few other aspects which they can do via new perks(not legendary) just normal perks.
---
Great run down of heavies, appreciate the info.
---
Oh bethesda is aware, it's a reoccurring suggestion/bux/fix request on here.  It's not a high priority for them though. They've been riding their lore fanbase to death with glitchy games and robbing  us with all the extra money they want via 1st and atom store. It was ok in earlier games you could mod..  or would put away after a while.
---
Good, you're not a flake. I'm impressed.
---
So the Fixer is kind of a funny duck.
---
The base version is an upgrade Combat Rifle, making it the best "basic" weapon in the game. 
---
If you learn the plans for it, certain things will now potentially reward you with legendary versions of it- namely ranged guns from Mama Murgh, and Camp Ally "weapon retrieval" quests. These are the ONLY ways to get Legendary fixers, which makes them super rare and valuable. THey are tradeable though, which is why duped fixers are such a huge thing. 
---
Is it "that good"? No, it's just marginally better than, say, the handmade.  But it's still better. And everyone wants the best, even if it's only 5% better. And it's much, much rarer.
---
Oh, sorry for missing the other post. Thanks for the quick response. I changed bSteamEnabled to 0 and, yep, there are the 560 Atoms that I'm missing.
---
So I guess I'm just stuck with Atoms I need on the other client... I'm glad they implemented the fix and all, but I feel like I'm not getting those back, am I? :l
---
I already have 16 lvl 50+ accounts and 5 of them are between 120-380 4 of them made the complete story with launching a nuke and wastelanders üòÖ i guess thats enough
---
This is why. Plans for specific items that don't drop elsewhere.
---
https://mp1st.com/news/player-identifies-fallout-76-treasure-map-rewards-300-maps
---
lol i missed the first 10 days of patch 20 so im at rank 26. Im not too bothered about getting 100 though, i set my target to rank 82(secretservice ghillie).
---
Same haha, the nukashine quest spawned me in Ash Heap with a lvl 50 scorchbeast circling above and that was the biggest nopenopenope moment I've had so far. I'm only lvl 18 and just barely started exploring Toxic Valley
---
I play pacifist mode but will return the favor, especially if I've only been at the purveyor for 15 seconds.
---
You want to hit me?
---
Sure I'll back out but I'm going to keep hitting you with my loud thinking shovel while you out roll yuh our legendaries so you know how it feels.
---
Than I watch them waste 1000 rounds shooting blanks at me, laugh, and then block them.
---
Muh hahah that‚Äôs why I buy plans. People charge to much for weapons
---
Nice one! üëç
---
They‚Äôre strong but that kind of adds to the fun. I‚Äôm level 117 and I‚Äôm still slightly scared of hunters lol
---
Yeah I don't bother with Bolstering/Vanguard. It's easy to reach the DR softcap.
---
My junkie's unarmed full-health build runs Solar armor and still has over 400 ER/DR and 95 RR. I use a very random mix of armor, mostly because Solar armor is SO FREAKING RIDICULOUS TO CRAFT. seriously, it's 2x as expensive as SS armor and you have to server hop once for EACH PIECE (takes 10 vault steel; vendor only have 5 at a time).
---
I like to have a couple pieces of life-saving, it really leans in to my full-health tank build (hah, Imposter took 3 minutes to get me low enough to down me, and then I just self rez? Psych!), and the others are generally Robot/Ghoul/Animal/Super Mutant resistant. I don't sneak on that character so no chameleon for me. Auto-stim is vastly inferior to the 1star perk card, which I run, so no auto-stim.
---
The landing point is dependent on where you put your camp device. It took me like 5 tries but I have it so that everyone spawns in right at the entrance to my workshop. So, after I built my camp I picked up the device and situated it until I got the desired effect.
---
I don't think too many people know about this. I have spawned into water, off cliffs, in a tree etc more than a handful of times.
---
Hope that helps!
---
My friend once took her sweet time buying legendaries at Mumbles and another player came. This player stood behind her. Then a second player came and they formed a line. Lol it was so funny to see. This was at the old location.
---
only things I can think of is slugbuster with raiders and stealth armor with settlers tho the latter can be gained without actually siding with them
---
That said the rep grind is a slog so imo it's best to complete with the faction with the weapon that fits your build if applicable.
---
High level players usually welcomes the newbies into the game by gifting them the needed supplies. The first 50 levels really is the hardest to get past. 
---
But please.... just please.... dont start shooting a level 300+ player with your level 5 pipe pistol.
---
Shine on you crazy diamond
---
OP, did it look like any of these?
---
https://imgur.com/a/WawPbwS
---
Game drops, my friend and I are after a week at the last mission. No clue of decoding codes to launch the nuke. We went in, all of our hard farmed aids, ammo, armor and weapons where gone and broken during this run, which takes about 1 hour with discovering everything in the silo. We put in the nuke card.... Entered the code which we thought was right. 'noise of failure'
---
Card gone. No Nuke. Disappointed af in this moment lol.
---
Damn you Bethesda for specifically targeting random players to screws with!  Take me off your personally attack list!
---
there is well preforming and then there is killing the final boss of the game in less then a minute solo or the sheepsquatch in a single hit so no one else gets any credit the bloodied build is more powerful then twoshot ever was they either need to nerf it or they need to change the way xp and drop sharing works
---
no, thats not to top if you use the exec PA. but its way faster, about 100 lead in less than 1 minute.
---
I found a legendary The Dragon earlier today for 600 caparoonies. 
---
I expect I shall be sent to the shadowrealm presently, or I will start thinking a lot of people did more than that to get banned.
---
Let it play in the front yard with no leash.  A neighbors car will take care of it
---
aah, okay. thanks :)
---
most common is going to be for bloodied builds, so unyielding. Vanguard/Bolstering are popular, but really shouldn't be (it's pretty easy to reach the DR softcap, especially with SS armor). Chameleon and Weightless have some very niche fans, but... it's very niche. High health builds should really be picking up Life-Saving, or enemy-specific resistances (or Chameleon/weightless if they're a high-health stealth build).
---
Secondaries would be Powered (ap refresh), poison resist, and maybe rad resist (if it's something that doesn't already have it, like Scout or Combat armor).
---
Third effects depends. I like to have two Acrobats pieces on my bloody builds (I have jetpacks!) so I don't have to worry about fall damage. Lots of people like weight reduction, usually weapon weight reduction.
---
That's what I thought. But you can get the stealth armor before siding with the settlers. So it just looks like the slugbuster is the only faction exclusive item. Its weird that its one sided. Usually there would be an exclusive for each faction.
---
Lol. That's amazing. I'd sit and watch that play out too.
---
Haha, well done. Even at higher levels, without the right build and equipment a 3\* Sheepsquatch can be a bit of bullet sponge, mad respect for 2 20 somethings taking one out and not giving up.
---
Or look at the level after the purchase.
---
Need to equip your chest piece with Dense Mod, 50% reduction to explosive damage. Or use Fireproof 3, 45% reduction. This helps with her sonic blasts. Next is use Blocker 3. 45% reduction to melee attacks.
---
I run Dense and blocker and hardly die to her even when at 10% health. Acid attack is a whole different problem. Spam the stimpaks is all I have for that.
---
For bloodied solo encrypted I usually go up to 50% health and then spam about 20 stimsnto deal with the health loss and by the time I‚Äôm down to bloodied it‚Äôs dead
---
Level 33 just started on the game this last week. Charred Ghouls are pretty bad for me. Especially since it seems the minimum is level 62.
---
I had to. It was a good time. I'm sorry for sharing this on your post. your post just brought back such a good memory.
---
Thanks man! Im more impressed that we managed to do it with neither of us dying. I did go through like 30 stimpacks tho. I was a full barbarian two handed build, built to take damage and deal damage. Even then, I still had a hard time with all the stuns and AOE. If my buddy wasnt there to pull aggro when I needed it, I woulda been clapped for sure
---
Yeah it's not the acid attack, it's the melee. Does blocker work even when you aren't blocking? Because if it doesn't it's not gonna help me much.
---
In defense of them leaving.. I've been close to the 30K cap limit, around 28 thousand and had a player set me over the limit with a legendary purchase!!!
---
These days if someone takes me to about 25k there's a 50/50 chance I'm switching to a private server so I can safely buy a serum recipe to bring my cap stash down.
---
I know it sucks... but it sucks WAY more being at 28K caps and having a single player buy 2 really good legendaries at  about 10K each and getting almost nothing.. while your fighting a scorched beast. They bought a three star 2 shot fatman and a 2 star bloodied combat shotgun... that really hurt.
---
I leave my water unlocked hell even if they sell the water at a store it's more caps for them to buy stuff at my vemdors
---
From my experience it does. I use the perk because I love explosions. I don't use much legacy weapons but it works for sure on weapons with regular legendary explosive effect. So I see no problem for working on legacys.
---
Not sure about the gauss Minigun tho.
---
It happened to me today. Census Violence showed up on my camp (by New Gad). I was confused so clicked it. It sent me over to the flooded train yards
---
So bots are replying for Bethesda? Ok.
---
Blocks all melee damage to a percentage. No need to block.
---
Honk Honk
---
I'm glad you did. I love this stuff.
---
Oh that's nice. I definitely need that. Ill start throwing points into it. Thank you.
---
Depends on your mutations. If you pick up Adrenal Reaction for that reactive Bloodied damage boost (remember, Adrenal starts kicking in at like 90% health for a small Damage boost, you don't have to sit at 20%), it eats a decent chunk of HP. I wouldn't bother getting Scaly Skin or Grounded since PA resistances are so high that both of those will have very little positive effect.
---
Then just look at the other mutations positive/negatives and see what you want/can live with/might want Class Freak for.
---
[Nukesdragons.com](https://Nukesdragons.com) if you havn't checked it out yet.
---
Stranger danger.
---
In all seriousness though, that does suck. I never lock my CAMP. I'd rather people come in and help themselves but not everybody is of that mindset so what can you do.
---
Reminds me of when I met up with a dude when we were both in our low 20s, I was being assaulted by a scorchbeast and he came to my rescue, we spent the next 15 or so minutes killing it, then got a photo in front of its corpse to commemorate the moment. One of the first images I took in the game back at release before taking a near 18 months break lol.
---
If all the earlier angry posts about Bethesda‚Äôs delay on purchasing ranks are any indication, a lot of people are more than happy to throw money at ranks. Beth may not have to charge for season passes as long as FOMO keeps atoms flowing during the seasons. We‚Äôre only a few weeks in, and people are already buying their way to the end. I think that is exactly Beth‚Äôs design for these seasons.
---
&gt;The damage on my bloodied stealth commando is great, but it‚Äôs getting boring, especially with more active group events. It‚Äôs becoming an easy button for the game and I feel rude if I show up and start killing everything in one shot at most events.
---
I feel this. For sure. My main is a heavy gunner, with shotguns as backup. That's fun. Sneaking around, single headshot killing everything is not as exciting in groups. More PvE exploration, but still boring. I miss just sprinting in, guns blazing. My current build could support a guerilla style, so maybe I'll check it out. 
---
As for 1 shotting things at events, if I had a nickel for every time gun-fu switched targets, and I shoot for the head before seeing the 3 stars, I'd be rich. I've accidentally one-shotted so many legendaries, I'm glad I'm at range, and suppressed, because my own teammates are like "SOME DICKHEAD KILLED THE LEGENDARY" and I get suuuper quiet.
---
People really don't seem to understand that the intended goal of legendary perks is to take an insanely long amount of time to max. 
---
It's not them doing bad math, it's having unrealistic expectations for how long someone is willing to grind. 
---
Legendary perk math was determined by the same person that thought that 20 atoms for 7600 hrs of play sounded reasonable.
---
They said, nobody would use it.
---
Yea, its always awesome to defy the odds and bring one of those things down, despite not having any real ability to do so. I took a photo too and i look foreward to seeing it on my loadscreens :D
---
I move my camp every 3 weeks... That way it makes it easy for me to learn new builds. however I have to dedicate a full day of gaming to build a new place. But the place I have now I love so much I think I'm keeping it for a long time. I've had many camps that I've loved and a few just as much as this one... But it's time to call it home and stick around for a while. The nomadic life is coming to a standstill.
---
I show Gift icon, and when player turn around from vendor for my 'gift", I get a vendor instead of him.
---
Me too. Thank you.
---
I miss nuke mines when someone was afk at vendors
---
I have no idea what they plan on doing about it, they'll probably release a statement along the lines of "you can spend those atoms and any items will be available through steam" which is true, but not the point. But yeah. 
---
I have 540 atoms sitting on the bethesda client, that I'd rather have on steam so I can buy something else.
---
4 gaming accounts. That's..... yep your a fan!
---
Holy shit wait are you that guy from Instagram because I seen this on a account on Instagram
---
Well then do what I do. Nuke random camps. Cause, why not?
---
Solid build. Not too far from mine, and honestly, I feel like I need to be running gunsmith as more than a crafting perk. My main has 100 improved repair kits, minimum. I feel like my heavies break slower than my fixer. On my fixer build, my gun constantly breaks in the middle of a fight. Since my fixer build is new, I have very few repair kits, and HATE repairing guns at the workbenches.
---
Plans are dupeable too... :)
---
And they're fucking bonkers for saying so.
---
It's a gorram travesty that console players actually have a way to contact people in game and actually send them messages while PC players with actual keyboards don't.
---
Thanks but no it's not a stein, it really is a Chalice and I saw two kinds in the display case.
---
Yeah, they are... a text chat is a must have games like this.
---
The LMG's will have the highest DPS but will RIP through ammo, and .308 is not cheap to craft.
---
The 50cal is decent DPS and ammo is much more maintanable than 308, and the vampire effect will keep you alive.
---
The Gatling gun will actually do solid damage (scorched is perfect for the queen, and that 25% fire rate boost helps too!) and is VERY ammo efficient, and accurate. Get a speedy receiver on it for another 25% fire rate, a comfort grip, and go to town (don't get the bayonet, large capacity mag, or scope for it, they're unnecessary and add weight/reduce durability). 
---
It still won't do as much DPS as the LMG's (it might do as much or even more than the 50cal thanks to it's effects) but it'll be WAY easier to keep it fueled with ammo. And absolutely use it when the queen is flying- it's accuracy and range will be king, here, you'll miss most your shots with the LMG's and even the 50cal, just wasting that expensive ammo.
---
I knew it was you again before i even checked the name- you are one and the same who posted the awesome album not so long ago. 
---
This is now my new favourite, what a great shot. Thanks for continuing to share these things.
---
Worth it just for the blood packs it can supply, those combined with Chemist and Super Duper perks you can produced enough stimpacks for yourself and to sell every day.
---
Is this on PC? On PS4 it appears normal, no franken queen killer weapons etc. But the loot has been nerfed back to pre patch, all one star garbage melee now, if you‚Äôre after legendary drop from the queen, it‚Äôs really not worth the effort.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I'd recommend building a 1x1 square. 
---
Walls on back and sides, maybe windows on the side if you want to decorate behind his bar too, doorway on front. Either leave the door way odorless, or see if someone can put the circus trailer doors on it cuz they look cool and dont stick out far. 
---
Then you can decorate the walls with posters, weapon displays with instrument weapons, and even put beer steins and the punchbowl on the bar front. If you decorate behind the bar you could put more posters, a food display case, or a food o tron on the wall. Theres a lot of options really.
---
The stein and punchbowl will require that easy camp glitch where you shift things downwards using a slanted section of land.
---
If anything I said was confusing I'll be happy to clarify.
---
I do the same, one of the best atom shop purchases I‚Äôve made! ü§ô
---
That's not so bad. I just nuked Prime and only had 4 other people show up. There was a level 30, 2 people around level 50, and 1 level 300. Keep in mind this server had other people around level 200 and 100. Needless to say when the health only reached the 3rd star after 8 minutes I was done.
---
Where do you find this?
---

---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been using this build for about 200 levels now. Switched from bloodied to junkies and don't miss it at all
---
Interesting, I've never seen anything like that and couldn't find anything about that random encounter.
---
Some players thought the camp decor they bought in Atom shop is rare and don‚Äôt want others to see it.
---
Lmao
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
They did not design this so an average player would ever have 6 perk cards maxed. It's intentionally supposed to be a monumental achievement. 
---
I think they're definitely overestimating a players willingness to grind for this level of completion when they couldn't even convince most people to grind for strangler heart or possums backpack, so I guess we'll see.
---
Do you maybe have an image? I‚Äôm intrigued. I might send you an image of the space in working with. I‚Äôm just worried that with walls, it will make the space claustrophobic. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying to make it more open. I currently have it so the bar is facing away from the wall (my house) with 2 of those low defense walls (the wooden ones. Not the ones with chicken wire) on either side. I want a roof above it, but it‚Äôs hard to make it not floaty. Not sure what to do
---
My characters are CAMP mules. I don't want to loose my old CAMP so I start a new character and build a new CAMP for them and I've long since run out of characters. Now I mostly just polish and rebuild small things in my five CAMPs.
---
And we need more displays.
---
I mean, they have the accordian in game and have yet to add it as playable. 
---
At least they finally made steel drum work for raider tents but not being a CAMP item definitely is less desirable.
---
Wait till you run into a Fog Crawler in the Mire.
---
No, it only affects native explosive weapons - the two grenade launchers, missile launcher and fat man. Also all grenades. It does not increase the explosive radius of the explosive legendary effect (this was tested by shooting at a wall and checking the distance at which another player is hit - no change for weapons with the explosive 2nd star).
---
I try RP as a pioneer scout/outdoors instructor. Wear the possum hat and back back, not the scout uniform though.
---
I also run a camping shop at new river gorge resort, selling aid, canned food, pemican, magazines, binoculars, gas masks as well as the occasional weapon and Ammo.
---
No shit, I‚Äôm  gonna have to check that spot out
---
Yeah I hated those for the longest time
---
Blocker, serendipity, fireproof, nerd rage, when u are not in a team lone wanderer and because you are a bloodied build I would recommend the rad resi perk at endurance. One of my favorites is also ghoulish because u are always under effect from rads which causes a all the time health regeneration. That's my standard way to go when it comes to a queen fight solo.
---
They were up for the month, not a week but there hasn't been any word of them bringing them back. I really hope they do at some point.
---
There are free browser VPNs
---
Yeah. Its def one of my qol perks but it seems worth it, especially with agility and luck already maxed.  
---
Vaccinated is my other qol. I have the worst luck with diseases.  
---
Other than that,  its pretty much all raising damage output and lowering damage input. 
---
I use only the mutations that are worth it so I can get out of class freak.  
---
It works.  I love it.
---
Yeah this happened to a friend that got banned cuz he get a legacy gun just before they remove it and he still hasn't have a response bout the unlocking of the account
---
Wait for the first Mirelurk King. They got health af and are pretty strong. I'm lvl 260 and I still hate them to fight
---
I do want them to look in place in the world. It's a pity you know it's a CAMP as soon as you see the brick walls. Now we do have the contemporary wall set and that gives a little bit of variation. I haven't seen many other walls that could pass for in world buildings.
---
But I do love coming home to my bar and see the door to the old Nuka Cola machine open. Someone thought there might be a cola in there.
---
Keep in mind that you can use the perk card 'contractor' under intelligence to really lower the cost of the decontaminator.
---
You can use one handed in power armor but not unarmed weapons like the death tambo or deathclaw gauntlet, power armor isn't really important late game
---
I just started playing yesterday and have been having a blast with the game world feeling like a fallout game, but still feeling like it's online.
---
I just started building my first camp and it's been fun so far. Ran out of materials pretty fast so I'll have to go out and salvage some more soon. I already had a guy come up to my base, check it out briefly (not much to see yet) and give me some meds and water. Really enjoyable experience so far.
---
Assaultrons eff me up personally. I'm level 42 going all in on non automatic rifles has its advantages and disadvantages.
---
This. All the other varieties of Mirelurk I can just mow down, but Kings I'm backpedaling the entire time hoping he dies before I have to reload.
---
Got a link to this YouTube video?
---
Already was going to use that but thank you for reminding me about it.
---
The ranger armours from the NV dlc are easily my favourite in the entire game. I was bummed when they weren't in fallout 4 (ps4 for me) and was stoked to see them in this. The elite is my favourite by far cause all the little addons to it, but all the sets look great. Easily raises my enjoyability of the game by a lot. I prefer it to power armour. 
---
Fallout 76 feels really good so far and the only major complaint I have is the way they handle cosmetics. So many things are added and then disappear in to the void never to be seen again; it's a pretty bad way to handle it.
---
Yup. I've loaded in to see players already fully kitted out a few times. "Waiting for players" my arse. How hard can it be to set up some kind of server ping so the game only loads people in when everyone is ready?
---
The lighting and bloom is quite good but the texture quality is average to say the least. When the game came out it already looked dated.
---
Only sometimes tho...
---
as a bolt action rifle build Ghouls are my worst enemy they attack in packs :(
---
Most camps that do this have windows and woekbenches close by that i can use from the outside. And when im done I will need to fast travel out.
---
Yea I mean I'm a bloodied melee. This means I almost one tap everything. But I need at least 3-4 hits ( each slapped for like 2000 dmg) until they die lol
---
Reminds me of the level 5 during meat week fighting a legendary alpha deathclaw and Legendary Yao Guai with a bolt action pipe pistol.
---
Also have you run into a pack of Floaters yet?
---
Would the gladiator perk as well as the iron fist perk work with the unarmed weapons?
---
Pretty much the only reason that I still play.
---
In 9 months I haven't seen them bring anything back F1st related, nor have I heard any rumors they plan to. Only Atom Shop items have returned.
---
I doubt they will bring anything back. Whole idea is to get people to subscribe every single month so they don't miss out on anything.
---
That sucks. I always check if anybody's at my CAMP before logging off and wait for them to leave before I do
---
[Here's my current build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aea45a3&amp;d=s92sf2pn2pt2pu2pv2ej4c72ar2an2ao0ir2i11e82ah0ep1l71lu0pf0a41sv3&amp;w=sa1s72sb1e12c31c52i44ic4i61a72i30ii0ij2ia0iq2i50ik0cr0p10pa0p80p90ag2lm2if2i91c10c60cf1l60l90l00at1e40ea0el2e50p00pd0pe1s61ss2s01&amp;m=9f8&amp;nw=e0e1c0c1a5l3l0&amp;am=132539-14263a-10-182336-11&amp;wp=waw0&amp;wm=1h2737-1j2038&amp;n=Ophelia) :) I'm still working on getting all the legendary armour that I actually want...
---
As I mentioned, I swap cards in and out so I have quite a lot in my deck that is only equipped for crafting/scrapping/selling etc
---
I chose to max out each one of the archer perks in turn but it's also a totally valid choice to do one level in each. Up to you!
---
I keep seeing demolition perks being used in hypothetical builds so I was wondering the same thing.
---
An image would definitely help me explain better. Birdseye view with picture mode I think would be best. I'm not able to get on the game at the moment to really make a mockup. Ill try to find some grid builder online and do something. What platform are you on btw?
---
I don't like when tree branches clip through into the house. Here you've used that in the theme. Mothman cultists use a lot of stangely chaped wood in their CAMPs and here it just adds flavor. Very clever. I like it!
---
Here:
---
https://www.trueachievements.com/n42518/xbox-gameplay-chart
---
Since we know that Sea of Thieves gained around 5-million players this year, we can see that Fallout 76 has done alright for itself. It is above SOT in the charts!
---
If you're able to launch a nuke but not able to do enough damage the the SBQ in 60-90 seconds to get loot you should honestly look over your build. I'm not trying to be rude I'm just saying that you may want to rearrange some perks so you can be more effective. No matter what build you are you should easily be able to get enough damage in that time to get loot.
---
I'll join and put down camps or use stimpaks or something.  I won't actually participate, so some challenges like 'kill players' will remain unfulfilled.
---
Thing is, these challenges are so obviously about promoting NW, but if I'm not interested by now, then a few SCORE points aren't going to make any difference.
---
Honestly the way they've handled add on items and returning armours etc makes me worry about the next elder scrolls. I'm really worried they're gonna lock known items and armours behind FOMO microtransactions, and the way they've handled fallout 76 only makes me worry more.
---
&gt; One day in the future, when I complete the set, want to be able to have a creepy room in my camp of all the nurse's outfits. 
---
Sounds like a good time :)
---
Melee build are very powerful.
---
Oh, yeah high level player went through an area and I faced a level 62 legendary assaultron. Almost killed me but killed it eventually
---
No, unarmed weapons only get iron fist and one handed only get gladiator. Best unarmed weapons are the bear arm, deathclaw gauntlet and power fist and the best one handed weapon is primarily the assaultron blade to my knowledge but the shishkebob is decent when its modded
---
I killed three of them in Windigo caves? Or are there other Mirelurk Kings I don't know about lol. They were a walk in the park compared to the Hunter
---
Only door I lock is to my generator shed so people can't come in and flip my vendor/garage door switch. I do have a locked door on my workshop (which is in the train carriage prebuilt) but I leave it open and only close it when I need to go afk.
---
I would also like to know
---
nukashine, or nuka quantum?
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
I‚Äôll get a few pictures. Birds-eye, and some other perspectives of the patio and the bar itself, as well as surrounding areas to get an idea of the general themes.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a month ago, might come back in October maybe
---
Unarmed is much more powerful than two handed and one handed, if you want you can plan your build at https://nukesdragons.com/
---
God... What a bunch of dumb fucks over at Bethesda these days.
---
Coming from other grindy online games like Warframe and RDR Online, I can without a doubt say that Bethesda's XP sharing system (aka there is none) is beyond doubt the most mind bogglingly worst implementation I ever had the displeasure of seeing in a cooperative online game. I have no clue who the hell sat down at a meeting and thought group infighting over kills and XP is a great idea...in this type of game.. Yes, you might get some dead weight leechers if the XP was just shared to everyone in range, but it sure beats the current implementation.
---
Just finished mine, it's my 4th character.  Really like it, feels a lot like bloodied.  https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=bf413e8&amp;d=sd2su1so2sp2p00pc1pg2ph2pp2pi2eo0eh2ce0ib2ar2an2ao0a02a30as2l71lt2lu2
---
I use the broken chinese suit when in nuke zones but just wear unmodded underarmour when not, don't like chamaeleon.  I have to be very careful with explosive weapons though.  Ber Explo shotty and handmade/combat/assault rifle.  I'll use a fixer instead of the combat when I get one.
---
Nukashine
---
Yes it is absolutely worth it.
---
Honestly, if you only use PA, then you should just get it and see for yourself if it's any good or not, rather than asking Reddit.  And so what if it involves grinding? What else is there to do in this game right now?
---
Yes it is better power armor than Ultracite.  And noticeably better, I don't care what anyone says.
---
Strangler heart  mods are ridiculously rare and near impossible to find, and it requires Vault 94 steel to craft.   If you still think Strangler heart is better because it has a very small acid damage bonus, I honestly don't know what to tell you.
---
People here are talking about T65 and diminishing returns. If diminishing returns apply to any armor, then it's clearly the Strangler heart because of the impossible to find mods and expensive crafting requirements.
---
Yes, Preston Garvey has scarred many of us...
---
I still have nightmares... just WHY?
---
Yeah, it's that Jesus beam of might that gets me if I don't have somewhere to dip behind lol. But they are pretty relentless about getting in your face.
---
All I can think of is buying monthly and covering two periods when they bring something new out for F1st.
---
What's placed into the scrap box can be accessed, just can't place anything new into it. Also will loose access to the tent, but if caps aren't an issue for you then that's not really a loss.
---
All you will really loose is time, so it's up to you. How valuable is your time in the game.
---
For me it worked out to cost 25c per hour as I play a couple of hours a day on average and buying the year was a cheaper for me.
---
Mind you, $180 was a kick in the teeth considering I pre-ordered the Tricentennial Pack and paid $140 for that. Plus have bought the Elder Battle Coat DLC which was another $15.
---
So Bethesda has definitely got their moneys worth out of me.
---
Here's a slightly outdated gallery of my camp. Becketts bar is in the 2nd pic. I plan on putting a Thanksgiving display behind him with food and drink when I can buy it.
---
What I'd propose is either doing a 1x1 or 1x2 space for him. If 1x2 make it 1 wide 2 deep. Front is the doorway with his bar right up against it. On the side facing away from your camp put a window, on the side facing your camp put a door he can come in and out of. If 1x1 you should be able to fit a stove to one side, and a display behind. If 1x2 then you can put more appliances, maybe fridge, sink, whatever else you want.
---

---
I always place my camp near foundation so that people can join my public group and get that free fast travel for handing in quests. I also have my decontamination shower in the "public area" for anyone whos been doing the queen event.
---
Vats only works with energy weapons in PvP, stupid if you ask me.
---
Yes. HP buffs affect the threshold. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
yo sorry for invading your post but please let me know if you're on PC and want to sell the mask.
---
Sounds good. I'm on xbox otherwise I'd be happy to get on and help you build. Check my other comment for a fleshed out concept and pics of my camp for slight reference
---
(double score malfunctions, makes negative score, ship slides backwards on Leg Run board, won items reLock)
---
"Nooooo....."
---
(Todd giggles)
---
He might have been geared and had his favorites wheel set up for pvp. Quntaums get spamed a lot
---
Ya I removed it and it works now, I don‚Äôt know why
---
He could use serendipity, nerd rage, lone wanderer to compensate the dmg you deal. And if he used  Railway he can use Vats in pvp. Also the most legacy weapons will melt your face instantly
---
no it's not. It's the best protection you can get baring VERY situational full 3star legendary armor sets.
---
Its double dailies isn't it, not double SCORE?
---
This KILLS me!
---
Yea I think there are a few in that cave.
---
Not sure if this is dependent on enemie lvl or something but the Scorched/glowing max lvl one is a monster haha. Not the sonic attack Is what deals dmg to me but the punches. Jesus....
---
Yup, had to cheese it into melee attacks and hide behind cover during the beam of obliteration
---
To me lately, Son's of Dane "**One Violent Night**" has become far worse than "**Free Range".** I don't understand the rush, every time I have participated recently people with high level characters who know the mechanics of the event have been playing all instruments, jukebox etc and rushing it to kill the wendigo. Earlier today not even 1 legendary ghoul spawned it was so rushed. I remember when I used to farm it solo sometimes and get 4-5 3\* to spawn and go up a couple of levels myself.
---
Beth12: "Todd, people are complaining"
---
Todd: "how?"
---
Beth12: "with typed out messages"
---
Todd: "Impossible!"
---
(Todd has beth12 killed)
---
What plans you have
---
oh, in-game... ok
---
I love a good base build. I follow aquanova play on YouTube and combine her builds with mine. Learning all the little detail into moving blocks together like a puzzle building a unique base. Rn I‚Äôm currently using a modern mobile base in case I need to move to another deposit and get a ton of people passing but doing the heart emotes and they to stick around to watch me build which is pretty cool.
---
I'm going to the mire right now for the missing link quest. We'll see how it pans out
---
Thank you.
---
That I can see. They're kinda push overs at low level right now
---
Sometimes you got a bad glitch that can't wait ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You‚Äôre welcome. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It's a common mistake y'know
---
I have done the same village setup in that same location. It‚Äôs a great spot! I‚Äôm on PS4 if you want a tour
---
Double score is only for dailies
---
since we have to "relog" between NW and normal, does it falsely increase DAU?
---
Man I've literally done hundreds of cranberry bog maps and I've only gotten t-60 plans for a left leg and right arm. I think grinding for t-65 will be less of a hassle.
---
Nice work!
---
(Todd watches you re-log into game, DAU increases further, Todd laughs)
---
That Anti-Armor Pump looks like a a "magic damage" weapon with the variety of damage from the pellets. Not hacked, just a bug with the game (there's a bunch of "magic damage" variants, some shotgun specific, some high RoF weapon specific). 
---
The perf mag issue looks sad though :(  The only thing I would caution is that the damage numbers are not actually "real". They are predictive, and very poorly done at that. Buuuuut... looking at the health bar move, it appears that they do do the same damage output. I may test this between my 2 accounts sometime soon to see actual HP loss values.
---
Then if you keep dying because of the explosive perk you should invest for the fireproof perk
---
I came back to camp one time and the two guys that had been shopping were sitting on my couch with my plushie when i got there (maybe taking photo, idk) then touring around the entire place and giving me thumbs up a few times. Such a good feeling when others appreciate the time you spent on your camp. I try to do the same at other folks‚Äô camps. 
---
also something i noticed when i was afk but still in the room one day, when people come and shop, they almost always sprint out the front door (vendors are inside) just to fast travel right on the porch. Idk why but their brains tell them to leave and then they leave after they leave lmao
---
I would love a church organ (to go with the church camp I have with one character and a 'spooky castle' I plan to do for another).
---
Bethesda should listen to you and make it a chance to drop in meat week
---
Same here.
---
it depends... but often there's a bit of spread outside the nuke zone itself. But I've certainly seen nuke borders where it was a hard cut right at the edge.
---
I accidentally made it close to Arkhos Pharma as I was following the river 'cause I wanted a place with access to water and I just figured it's at the center of like 5 events so anyone who's out of those events and wants to regroup and recuperate my door is always open to you folks.
---
God mode my friend
---
I managed to balance out my mutations, so I only use class freak as a force of habit. I should dump it, but I can't bring myself to do it. As for diseases, I've spent the whole ~500 hours I've played this game with a disease, and it's never bothered me. Unyielding armor makes up for A LOT.
---
(todd logs in, his character flies over your camp, spraying shit everywhere (literally scorch-beast-poop piles) that spell out "Todd Wins")
---
Was fixed by latest patch.
---
I want a 'facepalm' emote.
---
This should definitely feature an image of the Captain Picard meme
---
Calibrated shocks, targeting HUD, and emergency protocols are valuable. Everything else is meh.
---
Nice! It took me something like 50 crafts but I got myself a B25 gauss mini as well. Just a 2star, but I'll keep it, I run Bear Arms anyway so it's not too heavy.
---
Got a B10 plasma caster on my very first craft.... yeah boi.
---
(Random npc with briefcase shows up at camp)
---
(briefcase is nuke)...
---
I ran into a three star level 50 sheepsquatch when I fast travelled to do a mole rat horde event.
---
Cue a bunch of super mutants being there with two three star legendaries as well...and a bunch of robots at that location in the ash heap.
---
I got 6 legendary drops but couldn‚Äôt put down...or even make a dent really, the sheepsquatch...I ended up escaping through some robobrain cloud and ran while they sorted each other out.
---
...I really wanted that three star medics vats enhanced rolling pin though :(
---
Not that I've noticed, no. Although... which one is targetting again? I keep mixing up the "tracking" one and the "highlights" one. The Tracking one (and all the tracking scopes) got broken over a year ago and are effectively useless now.
---
Just a bunch of mounted heads, decorations, armor mods and plans for some armors themselves, a couple of weapons and a bunch of prime receivers and capacitors
---
As a side note, we should be able to move repair kits btw characters. Lol
---
Hmm I‚Äôm not sure then sorry. There seems to be some cases where that ini setting doesn‚Äôt work for people by the looks of it. Possibly something to do with 2FA or the way accounts get linked. 
---
We really shouldn‚Äôt need to do all this going forward so I suggest your best course of action is to create a support ticket and see if they can get the atoms transferred across for you.
---
I once called Bethesda offices, asking to speak to Todd, later my power went out. 
---
damn synths
---
Do you have buttressed marine armor limb plans or mods
---
It's a woman, but her name is petra. Lol
---
I like to call that the Swoop'n'poop. Nice photo.
---
My rifle/commando has TERRIBLE luck crafting SS Unyielding. Like... abysmal. She has a Uny/+1 charisma chest just so she can rock the jetpack, and has rolled a 1star right arm that she won't wear because her previous arm is a good 3star. I think her left arm is decent enough to wear though. Nothing worth getting on legs, but... I'm chasing Poison Resist/Powered/Acrobat (which is what I have), so it's gotta be very specific to be worth it.
---
My melee has INSANE luck crafting SS unyielding. Like... very first piece was a Unyield +1str chest. Legs were both unyield within 10 crafts, 1 arm was very first craft... whole set was done in less than 30 crafts. Have had multiples of most pieces by now trying to get better rolls (several of my pieces are 3stars, but not "good" effects like Powered. I think I've got some Cavalier though, which works well with my melee)
---
That‚Äôs exactly what a synth would say!
---
Recall code: Y 7 J 6 X 4 A
---
Working together with a friend is one of the best things about this game. Mad respect for not just running away, at lower levels the resources used can be a massive hit. I find many higher levels don't even coordinate that well with taking agro to protect their team so some of the ol timer's can even learn from you
---
https://youtu.be/9tjl25ZSdYI
---
I think it‚Äôs cute.
---
It's so dumb for a multitude of reasons:
---
1. It limits creativity even though people can make physics-defying structures anyway. Just let us build how we want.
---
2. It can also happen in such a way as to prevent you from deleting an object *at all.* This means you're able to place, say, a foundation somewhere and then be unable to get rid of it no matter what you delete before it.
---
It can't be both ways, if you're not gonna let us build anywhere then anytime we encounter a "inaccessibility" issue, just delete all of the items it's connected to. This isn't an issue for wall decor &amp; walls or for floor decor &amp; floors. Delete/stash one &amp; the decor goes in the stash.
---
But it's a double whammy. Can't build anywhere, also sometimes you can build but then not delete lol, pay for Fallout 1st today!
---
Apart from revive a player very easy score to get though. Now double exp is gone and lunchbox stashes are dwindling probably takes longer to get that 30k exp than a few mins in nw. Unless you have a private world more often than not you find the locations like west tek etc picked clean
---
Fix your DR
---
I think they should leave them.... because I think they should finally fulfill their promise way back when they made them legacy and "fix" explosive on them.
---
SO you keep the weapon.... but it no longer behaves Explosively. Now it has a new effect that does something different that's balanced with the game.
---
Nobody is in god mode, you‚Äôre all just soft üòÜ
---
Nothing wrong with being a bush baby! I only really go into NW for the dailies/weeklies. They should give much more XP for kills to force people to get involved
---
It's the best feeling ever!
---
Yea the biggest trouble is the combination of its attacks. They rush though your direction, start to scream the sonic attack, which is causing you to struggle and then while struggling they will hit you like a truck lol
---
She counts as both.
---
Absolutely! This is why I'm sticking with my camp for well over half a year without major redesigns. Hate to deal with that buggy af postapoc-sims mess...
---
It‚Äôs the highlights one. imo I used it and in day time it‚Äôs barely noticeable at night they shine a bit.
---
No not at the moment but I'll let you know if I come across any
---
Sweet, thanks for the info.
---
Works with railways too, and gamma guns. An automatic railway will wreck a lot of people if you can vats lock on them. I pvp a lot, and railways still get me.
---
NO! Not my factory reset!
---
"I am Bender, Please insert girder"
---
It doesn't.
---
THIS!
---
Ah yeah that one has no issues. It‚Äôs fairly noticeable to me, maybe your graphic settings affect it? It‚Äôs the only one I run, much more useful than any other for my build (heavy weapons)
---
Okay thanks
---
Its the coolest visual looking zone in the game enjoy.
---
as a new player... thank you :)
---
And this is why I don't get involved unless it involves someone I know.
---
45.  Played an alt all weekend and got it's level from 43 to 81 so not sure how I didn't progress further considering I play for multiple hours everyday and always have all available xp bonus' running.
---
Honestly, damage from the vast majority of players is easy to mitigate. Unless you‚Äôre setup for it, pvp isn‚Äôt going to work in your favor against anyone who‚Äôs even moderately perked out for battle. Pvp in this game sucks.
---
Cause Bethesda is dumb
---
wow you're blowing my mind rn as a new player
---
Do-able? Hell yes.
---
As good as other builds at one shotting the Queen?  Nah.
---
Just like every other weapon a bloody build makes it easily viable.
---
My previous character was a pistol build UNTIL I lucked out got a bloody FFR combat rifle...so I made that switch and everything died in seconds.
---
My current build is a shotgun build and it plays more like the pistol build did.  (Non stealth pistol and shotgun for me....the commando became a stealth character).
---
Bloody pistol (or junkies) can take a scorch beast down in a few shots...you just might need to carry a few pistols for different occasions (like I do with my shotgun character).
---
Is there any projects when multiple players trying to build one big base?
---
I don't get it either, I don't even lock my extractors.
---
I do heavy weapons as well (non bloodied) I‚Äôm on PS4 but to me I see a faint red outline that becomes useless like 50ft away. At night they stand out like a Christmas tree.
---
To be honest, I am fine with idea as long as it is not a mandatory thing. I enjoy building camps and usually put few or no turrets on my camp in order to max out building budget. If these attacks become mandatory (like workshop attacks), then I will have to scrap a large portion of my base to build turrets.
---
The first one
---
It's crazy how inconsistent and unbalanced everything in this game is.  I mean, yes, pistols SHOULD be less powerful than rifles and heavy weapons.  But if you give a fraction of a shit about what SHOULD happen, then a .50 MG should tear absolutely everything to shreds with ease.  So why not balance them, make it so each weapon type is viable?  Nope, not doing that either.
---
PICK A FUCKING LANE.
---
It is nice to get rewards for playing the entire game rather than just one mode.
---
Please, no... Because if they will ever implement that, it'll most likely ask you that every freaking time when you place anything and it's gonna be in a form of a message box with two options ("Ok" and "Of course"), none of each will be tied to any keybinds and you'll get a freakin' hard time to click on the right option (of course only one of them will work correctly) because of the game's lags and in 50% cases the messagebox will reappear persistently despite successful confirmations leading to the need to relog...
---
Because, ya know... It just works.
---
No idea, but I‚Äôm downloading the PTR right now to start checking out perks. I want to find out if the poison perk with matching armor set works with power armor.
---
I'll try these out. There is 0 chance I'm ever moving my camp. Its the first spot I decided to pick and I've never had issues with other camps in the same spot.
---
I don't have any spare points....!  I tend to switch to the Final Word 50cal from Beckett instead when its ghouls or farming glowing ones in nuke zones
---
At some point, you realise the event gives you better returns in terms of XP and Legendaries, if you just defend and fail the event. Than try to collect ores, and prematurely ending the event with full ores.
---
If you're going for the Event rewards, don't deposit the ores until the last few seconds. Increasing the levels just spawns tougher mobs with less returns. Keep it at level 0 and dump all the ores only in the last seconds.
---
Can you explain why because i dont have much experience with gauss weapons
---
this
---
I got ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù during the ban wave, started a new account/character on Thursday. I power leveled during double xp, got to level 78, and I‚Äôm having more fun with this half assed build than I ever did on my main account.
---
Bloodied build checking in. It's soloable. I solo it often. Full uny gear, event team for strange in numbers, 4 basic melee foods, sneak 3 and escape artist, first aid 2, I can crouch and activate all 3 pylons and just pop stims, the ISS never sees me till my vampire mole miner gauntlet hits her, 75% of the time its 5 hits and lights out, no regen. Most fails occur when stupid people draw the explody bots around. I can crouch the entire event without being seen.
---
They‚Äôre not going to be as good as some others, but they are a lot of fun.
---
I was in a party with someone yesterday, and it was late at night when I can't really use a mic, but he was using one.  It's like a god damn game of charades sometimes.  I wanted to be able to communicate:
---
* Thanks
---
* Sorry
---
* You're welcome
---
* Laughing
---
* Well done
---
* Goodbye
---
Obviously, you make it work with the thumbs up/down, wave, and heart.  But if you're not going to give the text system we really need, the emotes are not really a good substitute.
---
Thanks to Bethesda‚Äôs buggy coding, Empath apparently already cancels itself out. It gives the damage reduction to the group... well, you‚Äôre in the group. Add in Class Freak  if you‚Äôre the only Empath in a group it‚Äôll reduce your damage intake. Apparently a second Empath stacks with this for a ton of reduction. Angryturtle had a video on it recently.
---
I loaded into the throng of people while everyone was still voting on location.   No thanks.  The chaos isn't worth the SCORE.
---
Blocker and Dodgy just about negate her damage for me. I can tank her for ages without needing to pop health items, even in a stealth suit.
---
It isn't based on logins as such. It is based on who loaded up the game:
---
https://www.trueachievements.com/n35488/introducing-the-xbox-gameplay-chart
---
All Microsoft profiles list when you last played a game, so you look at that data and work out how many weekly players the game has.
---
And how many xp and dupe explaoits have been fixed? All Bethesda does is bandaid *one* way to do something, not *every* way.
---
We have word a another settlement ne- üò≥
---
Oh, well i won't abuse that but good to know.
---
Im about 550 with DR. Does it need to be higher??
---
Admirable.  :)
---
Xbox? I think I've been there
---
Is this XP farming and as you say rushing the event to get to the next one, legendary drops are pretty much worthless anyway and mostly scrip fodder.
---
The revive challenge is pretty simple aswell. Grab a teammate (friend or stranger from lfg) and load into NW together. Spawn in a spot with a decent amount of crates. Find a stim each and take turns to jump off a cliff or building.
---
Ill try both of them then
---
Oof, there's really a limit on that?? That's so dumb. How come it either doesn't have a limit OR stops letting people buy stuff if you've reached the limit? Or, and this is even crazier, only show items that will fall within the limit &amp; not over.
---
Welp this was helpful tbh . Learned a lot now to continue to improve my commando/tank build
---
at some point, you realise it's faster to server jump and jump player vendors to find the item you want. than to try to farm it from enemies or bosses.
---
I fight SBQ only for the fluxes and improved repair kits. everything else meh.
---
Just in general bash damage isnt really useful
---
They were trapped after the reactor accident during routine maintenance don't why you got downvoted you're right
---
Possibly, if he he not using racial or sexist slurs jjust rudeness may not realy be a problem.
---
He/her's probably RPGing as a rAiDeRRRR!!!
---
Imo definitely go for it if you plan on using PA in general. It‚Äôs statistically the best overall set in the game so why not? I upgraded from ultracite after getting the plasma caster plans first
---
Ahhh thank you so much. :)
---
My bloodied character will always collect his 40 ore while staying at a comfortable 20% health. Between the Chinese stealth armor and about half a dozen diluted RadAways, those tunnels are really not a problem to a bloodied build at all. My problem with the event is that everyone else is often only there to farm XP, and my 40 ore will be the only ore getting collected, so there's another chance at getting the rad barrel camp item gone and wasted. :-(
---
I do avoid taking a pylon with that character, though, because there is no way I'm useful in that role unless I heal all my rads first, and getting those rads back on is such a chore. Now if only I had that rad barrel.. :-P
---
Where in the video do you see nerd rage at full health? I don‚Äôt want to watch a 20min video of this goof just to try and find what you‚Äôre talking about
---
LOL! Thanks
---
well thats your own  fault then isnt it. shouldnt have KNOWINGLY aided a duper if you had that much to lose.
---
sucks to be you i guess.
---
It does try the patience to be true, I could be a jerk and do the same but I just don't want to be *that guy*.
---
Whenever i played with my friend he would have looted 3 boxes before i even loaded in and im like CMONNNN XD
---
I did that too.  Turned out, after snapping more foundations to the existing ones, it let me remove the stairs.  Which makes absolutely no sense, but hey, I got rid of those stairs.
---
This
---
Sunny in foundation
---
Feels good
---
Nah he‚Äôs crazy. You‚Äôve got plenty of DR; if you really want protection from her specifically get some Zealots‚Äô, but you shouldn‚Äôt need it with proper perks (blocker/serendipity/dodgy; and having an Empath on the team doesn‚Äôt hurt!)
---
you do more damage as a conduit though
---
Thank you so much! I love the challenge of real time photography in Fallout 76 where you can't pause the action like in earlier single player games.
---
I do see *the other side of the coin* now with the replies in this thread, especially Free Range with the event more likely to fail if everyone holds back so all have got the sheep tagged.
---
I'm glad to have ranted as I've learnt something, and shan't worry about this issue as much.
---
I dont have blocker and dodgy so ill definitely need those. That might be the issue.
---
Praise be TODD
---
Max cap is a way to tell you to DM. Nobody carries max cap and if someone did and pay the owner of the Vendor would lose money hitting max cap himself
---
I can't stand either and deleted them at the first opportunity.
---
My first encounter with the sheepsquach was at WS when it spawned next to my tent. I Was level 30 ish and sniper. Couldn‚Äôt put a dent in it. Died several times and ran away in the end. Now at lvl 247 with bloodied commando build it lasts about 2 seconds lol.
---
Farming the ghouls would be significantly more XP than event only XP, but yeah you can only lead a horse to water. I guess that's the point of private servers. I did see a few lvl \~ 50 players earlier that I'm sure would love the 4 or 5 legendaries that spawn if you give it a bit of time.
---
Are the magazines even worth it? I don‚Äôt think I ever used them. The bobbleheads I can at least sell for a few caps.
---
It only has 4 perks in the perception tree I believe. Three are damage buffs and one is armor penetration.
---
So then what is the point of having the Punk, repetitive music girl or grandpa?
---
I have 4 characters.
---
Unfortunately Wastelanders punishes you for having alts, with the Gold and Reputation grinds. Pre-wastelanders it didn‚Äôt matter which character I played, I could transfer virtually anything nice I found to any character (except for possum badges, but the plans are tradeable, so it didn‚Äôt matter!).
---
Now everything new and good is character locked. They really need to make Bullion plans account-unlocked :P
---
Bloodied easily survives the rads with the Chinese Stealth Suit, a good FFR silenced weapon, 2 RadShield and 2 - 3 diluted rad-x, along with Ghoulish.
---
:D. yes it's me!
---
you have 3 different damage perk cars with 3 ranks each in perception and also a perk card that makes it ignore armor and give it a chance to stagger
---
yes stealth is the way to go, if you get overrun you are in problems so you should stay hidden all the time
---
Where‚Äôs that?
---
I‚Äôve played this game since lunch ik how perks work. Sorry if it came out assholeish my bad dude.
---
Time for a bow only run.
---
Yeah, it's pretty silly, that's why I called it that. I also just assumed we'd get some actual wind instruments in that category eventually, but, well...
---
Nice idea. Once you get all the rare plans this event loses interest
---
Just people in a hurry then, much like real life.
---
Wow gunna have to give that a go that amazing
---
Also do you get it fresh out of the vault or do I have to find it.
---
20% drop chance as a quest reward from the dude at Anchor Farm.
---
Low on food? You get an HP buff when well fed (even without rejuvenated perk) and when you drop below 75% food, the buff goes away and takes its health bonus with it. Fast travelling lowers water and food states...
---
shooting him with a vampire weapon should work even if he's invulnerable. This can compensate for the damage caused by the pylons and you can hold 1 or more of these pylons for a longer period of time
---
I‚Äôll have to look at that next time. Thanks
---
lmao. i love how you say you bought weapons you knew were duped which means you know its wrong in one comment. Then in the next comment you say you got screwed over by Bethesda. like what?
---
If you get caught in a bad spot and she lands it ends very quickly. I have a bffr hm and have missed out after launching the nuke. I am not sure why ppl can't hang back a bit when they have obviously done 1k damage, but that can be said with most events where the legendaries get melted.
---
Compound bow is best. Get it from raiders high rep
---
Can anyone give a single reason why you‚Äôd play a game for hours to unlock new decorations, spend atoms, and then lock all players out?
---
There‚Äôs a rep system now? God I‚Äôm so happy am horny.
---
Wait. There's an endgame? Where?
---
Have you checked with the taskmanager what the actual name of the process is?
---
Well locking extractors are different because it's funny to see the defences kick on when they pick it XD
---
well im glad you learned your lesson. If you know its duped or suspect it is just stay away from it.
---
No, all those loopholes have been fixed, as far as I know. You need to have finished "Defiance Has Fallen" for the TD you find to be able to trigger the quest, and you can only hand in one TD per quest, so all the accumulated TD is worthless except for selling it to a vendor for a cap each.
---
dont worry i just said it that way in order to be accurate and i didnt downvote you btw
---
The fixer is gained from doing wolf in sheep's clothing quest line. However if you want a legendary fixer you need a fixer plan. Encrypted drops the plan but it won't drop unless you finish the lowe-down quest.
---
I always leave everything unlocked. It's not like someone can come in and steal my plushie collection lol.
---
Don‚Äôt care about being down voted check my comment history I‚Äôm a little toxic lol.
---
Makes me shit myself too much there sometimes.  Never know what's hiding behind a tree.
---
Walking Along casually. Attacked by ghouls when suddenly. Ass rape by Yao guai.
---
I came back for wastelanders and had ZERO crashes since then (PC), so its more on player side. And disliking me for what? Stop portraying dupers like they are innocent, fuk em
---
Yeah it is big.  I mean look at the northern area around WV lumber.  It's empty and unmarked. Aside from the Vault 51 defunct door
---
[SPOILERS]Rep has exist since wastelanders. You go through the main story. Break into vault. Get gold. Use gold to buy cool shit like compound bow. Daily quests after you complete main story earn you rep with either faction
---
I wish they would though. But I don't think they will yet.  Games too broken, Devs too slow to fix.
---
well just wanted to be clear that it wasnt me :D
---
anyways enjoy the archerlife
---
Thats how its done üí™üí™üí™
---
Praise be
---
Same, my boy, same.
---
Do you find everyone you can't fuck to be pointless? üò¨
---
Trust me I‚Äôm doing a bow only challenge.
---
They nerfed it into the ground. It does almost nothing now, and it was minimal pre nerf as well
---
Sounded like quite a wholesome pvp situation. 
---
I guess you could just put pacifist mode on but that would mostly get rid of the pvp element.
---
You gotta do the baa baa black sheep mission.. To start it you have to read a the poster near the widespring vendor about a sheesquash eating someone‚Äôs brother and it leads you to investigate the mystery, after that you will eventually finish it with a low level fixer and the access to start the encrypted event where you have a small chance of unlocking the fixer plans. You can then craft fixers and get them from the purveyor. 
---
Hope this helps

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation
---
Ngl I was a little mad when wastelander came out just cuz the wayward story line was poopoo.
---
Ive Had similar experiences, its all fun and games at the end of the day but some peaople are just asking to get dropped
---
I‚Äôll find it to hanks for the help anyways boss.
---
I really want something that plays that creepy organ music at that one church.
---
Oh yeah. It sucks. But I love the foundation story. I MADE A BRAIN BOT
---
PC had been thrown to the wolves in many ways. Hackers dupers and lack of text chat. Many players use discord but it doesnt help on the server you're on at any given moment. Does need to happen.
---
Finally own them now with a bloodied .50.
---
And you have to move your camp to use it. So, I wont use it anyway... no way I remove my camo that I built...
---
I do exactly this...then loot their collectron water source and mining machines.
---
so basically what your saying happened is a "glitch" (that you never explained)caused you to lose two legacy weapons (which you didnt mention how you aquired in the first place) and you decided to trade and buy SOME (allegedly not all) duped weapons. seems suspect to me.
---
seems to me like you tried to dupe your original weapons and accidentally lost them. then tried to play victim to bethesda and when they coudnt help you, you went and got dupes.
---
mabye im wrong though. But at the end of the day you for sure bought weapons you knew were duped.
---
They have lowered the cost for roofs and foundations and some other items slightly. I have suddenly found my previously full budget having some space left from time to time without loosing any items.
---
Bookmark, because I'm at work.
---
No. This is a bot that links you to a comment made by an employee. Read the bot, bot.
---
Ah thank you, i would still think i would notice a difference on level 3 ghouls but thats a shame, i wish they would bring back poisoners for weapons as that would be a counter for bloodied builds and with strangler it will destroy
---
My bloodied 1 handed melee would like a word..
---
I'll have to try that.
---
But I've grown attached to my execution tower. I'll have to rebuild it the way I prefer.
---
I wanna cross the river ffs!
---
...and now you are sleeping on the couch...
---
Personally i only lock where my power generator is and that's it, since i camp near vault 76 people can just come in and take what they want, water, food, even my raider collectron's not locked. Hell, even my vendor prices are cheap for low and high level players
---
Certain Plans can only be obtained from Treasure Maps.
---
Which ones? If you are do curious you can have a look for yourself: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Went from 690 to 720. That's over 3 million XP.
---
(It felt nice, not that slow and tedious normal rate that requires 4 hours of grind to get 100k XP given how much buffs my build allows as well as location mob respawn timers.)
---
I had a lvl 160 harass me while doing an event. His bloody build didn‚Äôt last very long to my VEFR flamer. Just because I‚Äôm 40 levels lower than you doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt melt your face. Haha
---
We went three rounds same ending. He eventually left me alone only to comeback completely respected. In the end, when you‚Äôre high level you get bored and the only thing that gets fun is picking a fight. Sometimes you get the horns when you mess around with a bull though. Lol
---
Don't bother with bows, they're not good. It's a bunch of terrible little things adding up to a broken weapon. The high reload time combined with the slow projectile means you're only hitting from a medium range with strictly stationary targets. That's okay, you'll just use VATS right?  Except the bugged VATS accuracy means the only way they could have been viable is and has been broken from the beginning with no fix in sight. Terrible damage outside of stealth too, so after you've wasted your AP and broken stealth you'll be tickling enemies despite having an array of deadly sounding arrow types.
---
Seriously, I have no idea why all the chargeable weapons are made out to be end game rewards when they barely work with the game's own targeting system.
---
That is 25 minutes. Got a timestamp.
---
only problem you gonna face will be scorchedbeasts
---
maybe carry around a supressed shotgun and equip enforcer to force them on the ground üëçüèº
---
I had the train from the Slocum's Joe set. It had my vendors in it and decorations all over. It had lights and power connectors and ribbons and posters. Very tasteful. 
---
I'm putting posters on the side of it just for the daily challenge of putting up wall decorations. My camp (at the time) ran out of budget. No problem, I'll just click and delete this poster... where'd the train go?
---
After remaking the train, then I had to reload all the vendors because of course they all reset to empty.
---
I'm not too behind on doing this myself but I'm not looking forward to playing through Wastelanders again on a 2nd character just to get the other Trophies for the Faction you initially didn't side with.
---
Could you buddy up with someone who's the equivalent of a tank build?
---
Could be a match made in heaven, you can do lots of damage and then they can shield/heal you when you get stomped?
---
BOW ONLY I AIN‚ÄôT NO PUSS BOY IVE BEATEN DAYS GONE WITH ONLY A 9MM ONKY AND IM DOING IT AGAIN.
---
You can get it from either settlers or raiders at max rep.
---
Suck my sweaty pp.
---
2shot Fatman worth that much? I had 2 in different points and I vendor them for 3k caps omg the caps I missed
---
allright champ im sure youre gonna do it :D
---
Why?
---
I play with a group of people. One is bloodied PA heavy guns. The other is heavy guns vanguard/PA. And the other is a mix. Problem is I'm typically the most active since their work is demanding them right now and mine isn't so I often play without them.
---
You contradict the other guy who said he tested it and it for sure it does NOT work on the 2nd star effect.
---
Who is right? Lol might have to pull my finger out and test myself..
---
Whip it out.
---
I speak from experience about the bow. Go for it, like I did, and regret it.
---
I‚Äôll record it too Just for u cutie ;)
---
I did it‚Äôs just too small for u too see.
---
The issue is I can't always get healed because the SBQ typically just one-taps me beyond reviving.
---
No, thats the skins name, nothing more.
---
My favorite planner
---
Raiders is easier. Still a bug to farm it. I hate people who exploit glitches but in this case I'm open to it because it is ridiculous how slow and hard earning rep in this game is.
---
Why would they be showing the skin's name as a legendary effect? ü§î It doesn't for any other skin...
---
you werent targeted at random lol. you said you bought guns you knew were duped in another comment.
---
It is a Bethesda game... there are bugs here and there (and everywhere)... :)
---
No I don't, sorry.
---
True üòÇ
---
Is it show as a legendary effect or is it just in the line with the weapons name?
---
&gt;Client Stability:¬†Fixed an issue that could cause the client to crash for PC players running the Windows 7 OS.
---
How on earth can 'fixing a crash on an 11 year old OS be on any priority list? If that fix did take more than 5 minutes it's a total waste.
---
I never had anything to apply mine to, so never bothered with it, but does seem strange it would show up in the effects list? Sounds like a sort of "Shadowed" effect, but for the gun maybe?
---
I used to have a Motel just south of that boathouse bar in Morgantown. I had six rooms in two stries and you spawned in room 13. It had the broken chair and dirty version of the same bed as very other room. There was a small shop, dining area and some workbenches in the back. I had several new player stop by and sleep in the rooms and use workbenches and shop after the vending machines dropped. I really loved that CAMP.
---
In the list of legendary effects as a new effect at the end.
---
Oh yea! Could be like extra stealth like on a fixer. That would be cool!
---
ya you could be right.
---
but at least hes still allowed to play the game.
---
Can you send me a message about that?
---
I grinded out settlers and started doing raiders--it looks like it's going to take a year and I hate it, just want the stupid ammo machine.
---
I refuse to ever do Ward's daily again.
---
How would you like the Reddit community to fix this for you?
---
You need to know the plan to get a legendary one. Or you could buy it from other players. I bought a 3 star bloodied fixer and it costs me more than 3000 caps.
---
I agree and I'm very new to the game
---
Ammo costs 750 gold. I'm still working it just to earn enough
---
Would've been awesome if they would of let us apply it to a Fixer! Very annoying they didn't as it's basically the same gun type.
---
Is this not the fallout 76 subreddit
---
I like it for the most part, may make some minor changes.
---
Now, as for weapons, I currently have Final Word, an Anti Armor Gatling Plasma (same buffs as Final Word), Zealot's Gatling Laser (with prime receiver), a Suppressor Gatling and a standard MG42. Which one (s) are the better weapons and which ones should I look for?
---
Just test it for yourself. Look for a few Scorched and shoot at the ground. After my experience with the perk the radius is much bigger. But I can also be wrong tbh
---
They still haven't added any new raid bosses like sbq?
---
I tend to think Bethesda is actually Vault tech, they are making sick experiments with us to see how we react, that's the only explanation as to why they make their games like this, with so little interest in them... yet I still like it.
---
I just don't understand why they don't improve it or fix the many issues it has.
---
At least there is a mod for this with many users, but the servers are currently offline.
---
Thanks so much, appreciate it!
---
What Godzilla movie is this?!?! Good shot!!
---
I need a skin on a Fixer so I can protect it from sale / scrip... The Dark Matter skin itself isn't very "wow" - just gray everywhere. Would be cool if they actually gave a skin that changes the model or adds some particle effects...
---
I mean the exploit. I have so much bullion and nothing to spend it on. The rep grind is terrible.
---
I think it‚Äôs a bit to late to buy them now I don‚Äôt see them going out for 30k anymore
---
Certainly would! üëç
---

Discovered one of the best Bethesda bugs, where all Halloween and Christmas rewards were being rewarded and knocked out both of those.

Check yo inbox
---
ya but the problem with that for people like this is that means they have to take personal accountability for their actions and they dont like that. its always someone elses fault.
---
Instead they are quick about stopping building glitches like placing stuff within destroyed stuff. Now destroyed things still have collision boxes. Fix other important stuff and let us have fun building!

Junkie's, that's a flat 50% damage boost with 5 addictions. And it's a magical effect, so you want to use it in VATS... And you got extra VATS accuracy. It's one of the best rolls possible. Consider yourself very lucky!
---
What are angry turtles fixes? Care to share a link I can't find them?
---
Yeah. The .50 cal MG should be able to shoot through 2cm plate steel, utterly shredding anything. If you get shot in the shoulder at medium range by a .50 BMG, it will rip your arm off. Yet I can dump 200 rounds into a person and have them shrug it off. Lol.

You mean you don't?

I got bored after getting my stealth commando rifle to level 170 so I leveled up a pistol build to level 50.  I am really disappointed with the gauss pistol and prefer a silenced auto 10 mm pistol with auto plasma pistol as back up.      
---
I think my next project to fight the boredom will be to level up a melee character, and get some perks for shotgun to so I can play either style on him.
---
Duped weapon
---
PS4 ... (sadly!) Her dropping that quickly was weird... each time. Yes, the drops are pathetic now. I only go for the Flux. Serums are big sellers for me :) Most time I leave all the loot because its garbage and not worth lugging around... unless they suddenly listen to the players and change the Script limit!
---
Oh yes! Everytime I'm going to remodel something in my CAMP I wish there was a save button so I had something to get back to. I've had to rebuild the whole CAMP from scratch too many times.
---
Yea ik it is but I haven‚Äôt seen them go up for 30k caps anymore all I see them in trades again
---
Yeah, I dont usually have that many stims :)
---
Last time I got my vamp plasma, my troubleshooter armor ... but that's how I do it with full health.
---
Yup! Lots of suggestions and workarounds on how to deal with issues, but not many people in this community can actually fix the base game
---
bro dont try to play the victim here. you admitted to having an account you used to dupe.
---
you also knew the weapons you were aquiring in trades were duped. dont say you didnt. you and I both know you did. 
---
time to take some personal accountability for your actions mate.
---
Sounds like a plan... LOL

I've built a lovely simple house just outside Foundation with a garage filled with al the workbenches you could wish for, the ammo. Converter and a free medium clean water purifier. :) I love to host new players and maybe sell them something with my vendor just outside the house. &lt;3
---
As many times as it takes.

Is buying a duped item from another player actually against the rules? Either way I can almost guarantee somewhere in your inventory are duplicated items/weapons xD and the point of this post is mainly about Bethesda poorly managing their own game. And yes it sure as hell does seem like it was it random, seeing as though major cheaters that I'm not willing to rat out because I'm not a bitch, are still actively playing. Did I benefit from a glitch? Totally! Did I actually exploit the game? NO. Get over your self righteous keyboard warrior small cack lol, this is a post for conversation.
---
Yep and a massive chunk of them disappeared along with everyone who duped. The majority out there are now with players who use them. Price is going back up by the day. Same with legacy‚Äôs
---
Mine too. It's like a beatiful house at the water with a porch all around. Veggies. Free purified water 3x5. A room with vendors and crafting. Separate room with displays. Bed. And piano.
---
Bethesda does in fact check this subreddit and occasionally reply to bug posts etc. Pull your head out of your ass, please.
---
I'm going to stear clear of everyone and everything if I get to play again. NO trading nor buying from other players ever again. In-game economy be damned. No matter what they're offering. Stimpaks? Foh. Berry Mentats? Nah. 50 rounds of .45 ammo? Eff off! I'll essentially be the same paranoid shut-in in FO76 that I am in real life. üòÇüò¨üôÅ

I built a new base the other day and I started with foundations on top of a small cliff and I built downwards towards the ground and it wouldn't let me place foundations, only top floors because it was on the other end of some stairs, I had to use a lot of CAMP budget on posts because otherwise a large part of my base would float. Because I used top floors I couldn't use the concrete stairs to get on the platform so now on top of using the ugly top floors on the ground I also have to use the ugly normal stairs (when used in that way they're ugly, otherwise they are not). Just let me build Todd.
---
Can't argue withe SS being ugly af. Some people seem to really dig it though. Different strokes for different folks I guess!
---
Idk why everyone gets so salty about bows. Will they one shot the queen probably not. Do they suck hard in vats yes. But manual aiming with them is a blast. I run a stealth archer/commando/ sniper hybrid and enjoy archery allmost as much as rifleman. 
---
The base bow is decent. The mod plans to change what type of arrows you shoot are expensive though Each one is around 1300 caps I believe.  There is 3 of them. Plasma, explosive and fire. Sold by random traders as well as one of the sunny bots in foundation and Ae-Ri in the crater. They also sell mods for the crossbow. 
---
the compound bow is much better but its a long grind to get them and you‚Äôll have buy mods specifically for the compound bow as well. But if you know someone with the plans they can drop compound bows for you. 
---
A bit of advice i can‚Äôt speak for console but if your on pc and happen to see a good bow in the player vending grab it. Especially if its a compound bow. Even if you can‚Äôt use it yet. I Buy a lot from player shops and have very very rarely seen any of the bows for sale. Even legendary drops seem to be crazy scarce. Iv had the compound bows plans for a while now and only ever seen two drop And probably less then 10 being sold by others. but that could also be just my luck.
---
I would try it if I didn't have to disable all of my mods every time. I know it's as simple as taking the custom ini file out, but I really, really don't want to do that every day just for a stupid daily.
---
Dont listen to this guy.
---
He openly admits to having another account he dupes on and sells dupes.
---
the weapons he was trading for he KNEW damn well they were duped.
---
dont worry about getting banned. If a guy is trying to sell or trade to you a weapon that doesnt exist in the game anymore as in you cannot aquire it through gameplay then there is a 99% chance its a dupe so stay away from it. its common sense really.
---
Just had this happen tonight on PC.  My brother and I generally run nukes for our guys (since we speed run them) and someone completely shit on SBQ and not everyone got hits in.  So it is a bit frustrating when you run them and do it to benefit players on the server.
---
Seems like we got a Karen here. Man you're putting a lot of time and energy speculating on things you don't know, you are commenting all over this post and have nothing constructive or interesting to say. So why do you keep talking?
---
Not really crazy, if you‚Äôre lucky and get a good gun anyone can do it
---
I bought a bloody crossbow the other day. I‚Äôm about to put the poison frame mod on and try it on my bloody friends
---
Lol you are probably right, his posts are pretty nuts lol
---
At the nuke site if you stand on top of the drop site v9 look to your right u see a shed/barn building there is a armor workbench outside and a weapon workbench inside, maby u can do some weight loss there!
---
Well, no. In PA with emergency protocols you get a flat 90% damage reduction with no perks used. Its like having serendipity on all The time with 100% instead of 40
---
I've done well over 60 SBQ events and rarely had this happen. It's not my build and can definitely hold my own. But when she reaches someone that puts her down in less than a minute, before even reaching the rest of the other players' kill zone... There is no way to dish her enough damage to count. When you hit her that hard, she stops in midair. She never landed either. Just dropped like a stone. Don't get me wrong. I've got enough Stable Flux from these previous fights to last a lifetime, but I truly felt sorry for the ones who paid caps to a dead event. My teammates, who were 200+/300+, weren't happy... (Of course, I'm thinking... I want what he's got!!!! LOL)
---
Anti venom and Fire Lining are the ones I was referring to, in the second version.
---
Me neither. I built mine into the pylon near the golf course train station and I love it! Lots of up! Convenient for gold course nuke strikes and centrally placed for getting anywhere. Now, if I could just get the damn garage door to work properly on my red rocket garage...
---
Ignore the haters that was actually pretty great to watch. Good job.
---
This screenshot should be used in the Fallout wiki!
---
Venereal disease.
---
Not everyone wants to play with others i suppose. A person making his camp for himself only, locking it would reduce/deter people from staying at this camp and therefore be left alone, i dunno.
---
I'm mainly a solo player but i don't mind having people come to my camp when my vendors are on and let them use workbenches.
---
Only thing i lock are my ammo machines and the scavenger bot.
---
underrated post. Hope they fix it.
---
I've tried to load into nuclear winter just to try It out but there's never any matches. I'm in Australia which I'm sure makes a difference
---
Insert obligatory "It just works"
---
Same my vendors are behind a garage door so i can lock them out of anybody if im close to the caps cap to avoid having more sales with no earning on them. The garage door switch is in a lvl3 locked room with my generator, master switch and no windows.
---
I'll take it as a meat week spawn. I don't even care about credit. It's just such a cool ingame assist that could easily be given to us.
---
Top left and I only knew because I activated my V.A.T.S
---
Because its bethesda.
---
fix all the bugs first is my two cents but hey
---
Drop it on the ground.
---
It would benefit me, I have done the slog to get the outfit for my main toon, I want a quicker way to get it for my alt.
---
Realy? Cool. I may try it out.
---
I wish I would of waited to get this game aswell
---
That seem counter productive. If you have something rare you sure would want to show it off. Although atom shops items don't qualify in that regard.
---
Soon when THEY FREAKING REMOVE THE NEED TO EAT OR DRINK...
---
I feel your pain! What‚Äôs also annoying is that it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbulldoze‚Äù certain items after you build it. My current CAMP now has a small tree growing through the middle of it
---
I'd watch the video. Need a quicker way to get the costume for my alt üòÉ.
---
I very Highly doubt i have duped items or weapons in my inventory. And the reason for that is because i dont buy weapons or armor. my armor i crafted my self and my weapons were either drops or rolls from the purveyor. 
---
&gt; Did I benefit from a glitch? Totally! Did I actually exploit the game? NO. 
---
lmao. thats like saying you knowingly purchased and now posses stolen goods but since you didnt actually steal them  you did nothing wrong. those are some serious mental gymnastics your doing there.
---
&gt; Get over your self righteous keyboard warrior small cack lol, this is a post for conversation. 
---
is it? your the one throwing around baseless and childish insults.
---
I didn't realize that this was a more direct connection to Bethesda's reps than their forums or the Support page, I'm sorry! Also: I'm kind of flattered and nauseated that you've spent so long thinking about what's in my anus (mostly flattered~)
---
"Ok then, that was always allowed!"
---
Drop it like it‚Äôs hot
---
You get some as event rewards.
---
Also, remember that you can easiely craft healing salve. Thanks to that I rarely ever use a stimpack‚Ä¶
---
You should go into politics. The bullshit lies you tell your customers is top notch.
---
haha. exactly.  Maybe they just hired name-making-person and he has a good time.
---
Recipes and decor plans are 10 caps.
---
Then I do it by rarity/usability. Like raider jet pack is 50 whereas T60 is 200. I've already got it so I don't really care tbh. Especially Ultricite plans. I sell for 70 each. 
---
The most expensive items usually are magazines and bobbleheads I find. For some reason people buy them out and I seek them for the 100 in-game price. 
---
I wish I had a sign that said "Fast Travel Fund for my Fiance" bc that's pretty much where I goes towards.
---
Adorable
---
We can agree to disagree, how about that :D I shouldn't have said small cack you're right, but you are being a self righteous keyboard warrior nagging and complaining on my post I simply was just asking for feedback on. If you don't like someone else's post, scroll past (it only takes a swipe), anyways I have to get to bed. Have a good night!
---
That's how stephen king novels start.
---
All of those are valid points, but the hanging tree alone was worth it so far imo üëÄ
---
Totes adorable :-D Feel free to hit me up if the inside of my but stays in your mind~
---
And where should I go to get a lot of healing salve ingredients?
---
I think a Pitt map would be awesome. Settlers came from there and it's before the Cleansing by the DC brotherhood. Be interesting to see.
---
Have been for awhile I believe
---
What's bad is when low levels keep shooting her in the air and stopping her from landing. I'm screaming in my mic... "For the love of all that's good and Holy, let her land!" :)
---
Stunning!
---
Im gonna change my camp location soon. Probably this week. My plan: Store all expensive stuff,chose a place and build the house then. This time it is gonna be nice and organized.
---
lol i dont blame you but i think thats going a little too far.
---
i mean using common sense you can usually tell if something was duped or not.
---
perfect example: if a guy is selling or trading a gun that doesnt exist in the game anymore as in you cannot aquire it through gameplay than there is a 99% percent chance its duped lol.
---
:D Welcome back!
---
Why are people downvoting this? He‚Äôs giving an honest heads up to do more, if you actually want to catch up, because at your current speed you just won‚Äôt. Which is proven, looking at the spreadsheets around here
---
In the Forest, just following the river from Flatwoods to the Overseers camp gives me enough for about 50 Units.
---
Having the Green Thumb perk helps obviously.
---
There fine I've been using them since I came back I got off during the radiation rumble glitch that had the NPCs steal your stuff and came back about 3 weeks ago
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta. My character is 238. I never got the achievement for hitting 25. I feel your pain.
---
lol you too man!
---
Well, the communist collectron, set to proletarian, collects a lot of stimpaks.
---
Thank you! Yes it took a lot of tries and a lot of Stimpaks over a long period of taking pictures. xD
---
My fiance would love this. She loves more space. She's only lvl 35 sadly if I recall. Had her first experience with PA and it reminded me how I felt when they introduced the FO4 PA mechanic. So empowering
---
Feels bad man, it's a deep cut. üò≠
---
Some settlers said Pennsylvania too.
---
Because People think you still have alot of time... Its all very pretty when you can level one rank a Day... Later ranks require 2 days to rank up....
---
Thank you :)
---
Well.. I think being on 40 is like 25% completion. Definitely not 40.
---
Because of stuff like this I have a level 100 alt that I use specifically to try out CAMP builds in various places. Only once I've figured out if my build will work do I commit to moving my main's CAMP. Even then it's frequently a PITA.
---
I've had 5 CAMPs with my main character - since BETA.
---
Awesome!
---
This was a thing before Wastelanders came out, and it was really useful - the CMs have not acknowledged it yet. I really can‚Äôt play the game with new players if I can‚Äôt see what their objectives are.
---
I think you should do some of each. Once you get inoculated yourself, it asks you to go talk to the Overseer. I think you want to be a decent level before finishing the Wayward quest line because the weapon you get may be a level appropriate one. Can anyone confirm?
---
Now that we have SPECIAL cards, there needs to be 7 slots, so if someone wanted to, they could equip all 7 SPECIAL cards at the same time.
---
Awesome!!! Great idea on the "fireplace"... love it!
---
You can get a lot by claiming many workshops and completing the defend events. I used to do this when I had 1st
---
I have no idea what you are talking about:   
---
[https://imgur.com/a/hxiuraE](https://imgur.com/a/hxiuraE)
---
And how do I get the Communist Collectron?
---
Which platform and gamer tag? I‚Äôd like to visit. I‚Äôm PS4 üòä
---
Like the others have said, collect ingredients for healing salve, and events.
---
My way is I bought a recipe for Stimpaks, collect blood packs and Tic Blood, equip the perks that double what you get for crafting healing/etc. items, and make tons of them. Blood packs are much cheaper to buy than buying a Stimpak from a vendor or the machines, and with the perk you can make two Stimpaks for one blood pack. People also sell them for like 2 - 5 caps each at their vendors too.
---
Okay good to know I'm not going nuts cause I remembered doing this with my brother when it first came out. 
---
It makes Teams a lot harder to enjoy. They serve three main and possibly intertwining benefits 
---
1. Help new player who are the leader with quests
---
2. Casually play with friends of multiple levels with no focus in one person
---
3. With public teams, buffs
---
Allowing public teams to share markers I think would help the lack of playing together in them. Cause everyone joins them but who really plays together?
---
Well... it has to be in the Atom Shop for 500 Atoms.
---
Agree here. Until I learned the Stimpack recipe, I was all about the healing salve. I usually walked from 76 down the hillside to the Wayward, getting all the spot flowers I could. Then walk from there along the river to Flatwoods bridge. Pick up all the blood flowers. (May as well get the snaptails to make sugar for cranberry relish while you are there). Load up on dirty water and then you should have enough for 40-60 salves. 
---
Green Thumb is a must here.
---
It is, because the requirements always go up, the extra challanges they give help... But its a bread crumb
---
Can confirm. Since the LR came out for sure. Even had my sister test. *insert link for ELITE fallout76 org here*
---
That's what killed off black ops 4 for a lot of us zombies players. Everything was so heavily stacked towards multiplayer and the battle royale. It wasn't until late in the game's life that you could even get any progression in their battle passes in zombies, and that was only 2 tier skips a day, no progression from exp
---
I'm on ps4 with FO1st anyone wants to nuke on a private server just let me know
---
I miss how in Fallout 4 you got Legendary Power Armor pieces by being with the Brotherhood.
---
Make a route through all the locations of the blood eagles, arround Savage Divide. Blood Eagles drop many stimpacks. Also, doing events / daily missions.
---
Wow. Just fucking wow. How about cancelling your sub and just meet people in game?
---
 
---
So.. Buying Atoms works, and seems to fix the problem because after I brought the atoms I completed kill 76 Aquatic creatures and I got my 40 Atoms! However I DID NOT get the other 325 Atoms I had Earned over the last week.
---
Use the mutation healing factor to bring you back to full health after a fight and you will find that you you use less than you find. I do and have to sell them every now and then.
---
I had trouble with the Collectron when placing one at a workshop. Never got the option to change what it was to scavenge for. Just got a blank area, where the options should have been. But at camp, no problem.
---
Unfortunately he's still a good source of treasury notes. You need 20 per day to maximize gold bullion, and you get 3 each from settler, raider, and Davenport dailies.
---
i first noticed it at a workshop and went back to my camp to see if it'd work there and nope :(
---
As someone who is also from the Down Under - just get a months worth, stock up on junk etc then cut away with it for few months, rinse and repeat. 
---
Eventually you'll just get a whole years worth - like i did....can't say i regret though.
---
Ditto! I eventually just removed the door entirely. Its severely broken.
---
I got it even though I didn't finish that line. I'm always too slow to initiate the even, when I think about it.
---
I read this and can't even BEGIN to explain my rage over this
---
To get that achievement, just make a other character and move the c.a.m.p. a couple of times. That's what I did.‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I try to do that but for some reason in the last few moves, my CAMP has a noticably smaller budget limit so I can't do decorations I used to do.
---
Bow is decent, but it really shines during events with lots of enemies and players (looking at you Line in the Sand). If you mod it with fire arrows, it works like an instant long range molotov.
---
You can tag entire groups with one arrow and get all the xp if someone else kills them afterwards.
---
Also, VATS is kinda broken, but there‚Äôs a method to it:
---
- draw the bow fully
---
- enter VATS
---
- cancel VATS
---
- enter VATS again
---
- release the shot
---
4/5 times I can then just keep firing in VATS and keep hitting my mark. Also, Gun Fu and Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint are great to extend that window.
---
Just make sure you stay hidden.
---
Mods for bows and crossbows are available from settlers and raiders respectively after reaching a certain reputation with them (friendly I think).
---
Compound Bow plan can be purchased there as well when you reach max reputation with either faction.
---
They need to switch it to a blueprint, then you could craft them as a camp item.
---
I enjoyed the experience was good fun.
---
A big ol' Thank You for that... awesome
---
Small chance is right! Done the event many times and still haven't got the plan drop yet. :(
---
With junkies and the ‚Äúmagical effect‚Äù shotguns in VATS seem to do the damage listed in your pip boy for EVERY PELLET, not just in total
---
Try placing it in a large open area and changing it, I have mine on a platform and I had to build an extra section of flooring, as even though I could access the terminal, it would give me no options to change that he was collecting. As soon as I put in another piece of floor so there was plenty of space for me to stand in front of the terminal, I could change his directive. I tested it and moved it again so that it was close to the edge of the floor and while I could use the terminal on it I couldn't change anything again.
---
The community is fucked. Bunch of selfish one shot killer pieces of shit. You met a nice person but it's known that society in general is full of selfish, self pleasing, self centered assholes. Have you driven on any major freeway in any major city in America? #mefirst #getoutofmyway #mememe
---
thanks. I'll try that tmrw. I've had them all on the ground so far but maybe on a floor it'd work?
---
Yes it stacks. Just find out when someone was sharing bloody mess while i had It equiped and my damage was higher than normal
---
Yes, I notice this hopping from base to base to shop, occasionally unable to locate a player's vendors and running around frustrated trying to find them, only to catch on after a while that they're always inside the Red Rocket garage that is always "closed".
---
My heart &lt;3 I love WV. I live in Maryland and cannot wait to go camping in West Virginia this fall.
---
No. You can currently only romance the astronaut (not going to try spelling her name) and Beckett. Bethesda said we may get more allies in the future. We may be able to romance some of them.
---
For me only problem with low settings is how shadows appear in certain radius around me. Looks super weird
---
Do you still need help? I can build one for you, free of charge:)
---
Any ideas on where you're headed?
---
I'm waiting for gpu prices to drop  after release of 30XX series. I thought of buying 1660 just for F76,but I don't think it's a good long time investment
---
There is a bug that allows you to save a blueprint of the machine and then build it in your camp xD
---
For a very good flow I‚Äôd do the original quest line, repeatable quest ‚Äúsomeone to talk to‚Äù, maybe the side quest line ‚Äúinto the mystery‚Äù for extra spice. Then do the wastelanders quests. I recommend finding others that need to finish the original main quests
---
Same. I'm upgraded everything in my PC, except GPU...
---
The perks from them not so much. But a lot of people, myself included, are searching for them to do the atom challenges, to display them in CAMP, and to find a holotape game which share the same spawn as magazines and are also an atom challenge.
---
Frog legs is a must nowadays
---
Yes, I can confirm but they‚Äôre not the best weapons tbh
---
Lol, I‚Äôm at level 35 and haven‚Äôt been trying to do score stuff at all.
---
Just playing the game
---
Camp building is so fun! I just built a cool train station on a bridge the mire and i get really exited whenever somebody comes to my camp
---
‚ÄúMessage set to repeat...‚Äù
---
Yes. I had a guerrilla for months. AP focussed. Pistols consume little AP when modded right. Great fun. Only problem is damage and armor penetration. I gave it up cause i felt to weak compared to friends and played less and less with that char. If you need a bit of a doable challenge, go for it.
---
Up to you. It looks cool and has a certain prestige to it. In terms of effectiveness, it basically on par with SH which also has swag and style.
---
However, since SH got nerfed it doesn‚Äôt really have that many benefits over other PAs anymore.
---
It‚Äôs super expensive to craft (like 100 vault steel plus 6 legendary modules) and the mods (especially calibrated shocks) are VERY hard to come by. I got my SH from the 94 raids, so I took my gold to buy the T-65. 
---
In the end it‚Äôs your choice. 
---
Anyway despite all the cool armors I got, I always use Excavator in all situations for the carry bonus lol
---
Thank you! How do I go about submitting it?
---
A) Escape Artist eliminates all sound you make while moving (except when sprinting), so yeah, armor weight is not a consideration when sneaking as long as you have this perk equipped.
---
B) Scout armor and Combat armor are still good enough. My full-health rifle build character is still running around with Scout armor and is doing just fine.
---
Vanguard's is OK-ish, but while the high numbers are impressive, it does give less survivability than a mix of mob-type specific prefixes. I recommend one piece each of Troubleshooter's, Ghoul Slayer's, Mutant Slayer's and Zealot's instead (your free choice for the 5th armor piece). Get two pieces with +25 poison resist and you'll be fine. If you want to be really tanky, get armor that has the 15% damage reduction while blocking/standing/sprinting effects as the 3rd \* effect, and choose the one that best fits what you do when you get under fire.
---
I dunno, if you have plenty of space around it, its probably not the same cause, but re-placing it might help anyway.
---
Indeed its a free travel. I do look for a free travel to north sometimes :D
---
Also it is always good to have active inspirational (also works in private if you make one)
---
There is the Wendigo Colossus which is a pretty tough new one. There's a super tough one in the new event called A Colossal Problem which will be released in the new update.
---
Supressing my laught, you ought to become a comedic-writer
---
This doesn't work for me. Are you sure you weren't in a party and getting loot because you were close to a teammate that tagged?
---
You could make a hat, or a pterodactyl...
---
Pretty sure it's just clutter.
---
I think it's for npc pathing, in older games they would barely use upper sections. 
---
So could be so they can idle better
---
Lol yup same issues, remarkable how long this has been happening and they having fixed it, Bethesda really are the most lazy developer out there, I am glad I didn't pay for this game.. Stick to publishing because you are an abysmal developer
---
Perfect that's a huge help- I like the idea Hunters/Zealots/Troubleshooter etc.
---
Do you know if the Forest/Urban still has one broken arm piece? I think urban randomly had an arm weaker than the other...?
---
My plans are dirt cheap on PS4
---
Wait u can type on consoles?  Wtf why cant we?
---
Just like fallout 4 the game presents a set of rules and boundaries to build within.  It doesnt make building impossible but its certainly a challenge that requires a bit of planning.
---
I getting messages from people saying how much they like my camp I'm surprised at how much it actually happens lol
---
Nice I'll give it a try
---
I don‚Äôt see them keeping this promise any time soon
---
Thanks! Glad to know that someone enjoyed it!
---
Dolly Sods has been on my list for forever! That is a must this fall and may be the first place I go. 
---
Besides that, just some general wandering around in the Monongahela. I‚Äôm a climber too so of course Seneca Rocks and The New are on my list. I wanted to backpack at Seneca Rocks last summer but there was flooding. I won‚Äôt let anything stop me from camping in WV this year though haha.
---
Oh I get it, but why risk anything at all? I'll never feel comfortable buying or trading for a legendary again, and anything else I want or need I can craft or buy from vendors bots. This has absolutely killed player to player transactions for me no matter how this 'temporary suspension' turns out.
---
carry them with you. alongside hundreds of pocket watches and thousands of pre war money.
---
next time you see a prize bot you kill it before it can start speaking.
---
them you shove all those watches, pre war money and certificates up his butt screaming: ‚Äúdoes it feel good, eh? how you like them prizes now, eh?‚Äù
---
while maniacally laughing and stomping hjs lifeless body.
---
that‚Äôs  what you do, sir.
---
Not only Watoga... The whole game is like that. The world and locations are interesting and very well made but yet there is almost nothing going on...
---
I think Bethesda planned to do a regular single player game and when it was done for like 40% Zenimax came and said: "Nah, it's good enough. Just add some vendor bots, holotapes, make it online multiplayer and we good to go making big money out of it".
---
Events and the communist Collectron.  It fetches blood packs which in turn with chemist perk, and super duper can produce enough stims to keep you going.
---
Failing that you can server hop the lumber mill below 76 and collect tick blood to make packs that way.
---
I will post here when/if I find it
---
It can be blueprinted and placed at your camp.  It actually screws you over and can bug out your camp budget permanently.  Plus it could get your account suspended or banned potentially.  So while it's possible to do, it's just an all around bad idea.
---
It really depends on which Healing salve recipe you have. All region have it's own recipe with region specific ingredients.
---
When that happens to me, I just make them wait longer.
---
Tyeah I have not yet got it too, although I do have a friend who got it first try
---
Yes. I run 4 accounts at a time, all with Empath. The character I'm actively playing is nigh immortal (especially in power armor). I can face tank packs of ghouls, Colonel Gutsys, and Assaultrons without ever needing a stimpack.
---
It's glorious.
---
I think all of those bugs have been fixed. There may still be an issue with one of the masks blocking more headwear slots than it should, but the actual armor pieces are fixed, at least as far as their stats and mods go.
---
I really liked the idea of using the bow. I tried it in and out of vats. It is just an exotic weapon for me atm with drawbacks.
---
However crossbow is very decent. Ammo should be cheaper (for bow as well).
---
I use them for inspirational and shared perks too. Just got the herd mentality mutation because of public teams, wouldn't have bothered before because I was solo half the time. Now it's nice to constantly have these buffs.
---
Raider Punk loves to use one of the Mr Fuzzy/Cosmic/Western rides I have at my camp :)
---
üòÇ Good job mate
---
They retired that quest.
---
I'm pretty sure that's just how.50 ammo gets done. It happens to me and my friend so I'd assume if it's happening to you it's just how it is
---
That‚Äôs a current method of flagging your account for banning. Bethesda have asked people who abuse game exploits to put these in their camps so they are easier to identify when the ban wave reaches them.
---
So I'm a little out of the loop with the legendary cards. Just so I know, every 50 levels I'll pick one, then to rank them up I just scrap the extra perk cards I have now for points and use those to get the higher ranks?
---
It's still kinda rare. Many were duped though
---
When this happens with one of my upper floors, I build a new foundation somewhere I can then build stairs that will connect to the area I want to start removing pieces from. Usually, it eventually works. I've tried it the other way, building stairs down and then the foundation. That doesn't work. I don't know why one way works and the other doesn't, or why something like this needs to be done in the first place. Hopefully this helps.
---
Not shocked, I paid 25k for mine about a year ago
---
Yeah a year ago that would have been a steal. One of the rarest outfits in the game.
---
With the dupe though everything's been thrown pretty out of wack.still a great piece and you could get a great trade for it
---
Hahahahhaha nice one
---
All I hear is ‚Äúgive me stuff to make my camp better because I don‚Äôt wanna actually go kill things and play the game like it was intended‚Äù
---
Must have been his wifu vending machine. 
---
"How dare you raise hand on my girlfriend??"
---
It came out with the fasnacht collectron. One of the coolest sets of paints along with pink sprinkles.
---
Thank you! A lot of patience and practice. Plus willingness to not get xp and get killed while hanging around war zones in photo mode. xD
---
Since you are obviously on PC, do a scan &amp; repair from within the launcher.
---
Could the dupe take place on xbox? I'm on xbox so I dont know if its rarer than pc etc
---
there is a recipie to craft them. from some point u almost dont need them. try to get a vampire version of weapon u like.  if u r low lvl u could ask other high lvl players to spare few. believe me they probably will give u like 100 of them.
---
Same. First thing I do when logging in is join/make a team. Get that extra xp and such going. Never do anything with the teams, just use em for the perks
---
Yeah the dupe was on every system
---
If the rewards from the season pass end up in the atomic shop I won't be happy.
---
I'm doing all this grinding for exclusivity not to save some money.
---
Imagine grinding all 100 levels for the cosmos PA skin, or even paying 15000 atoms to get there, only for it to be available in the atomic shop for 1200 atoms after the season ends.
---
Oof that's a rip
---
Photo mode is like 70% of why I play.
---
Anyone who has one will say its rare &amp; those that don't will say its not. A lot were duped, so I'd say not rare, but I'm one of the players who doesn't have one :)
---
Don‚Äôt forget you can dilute them too. 
---
With Chemist and level 2 Super Duper, the sequence of Tick blood &gt;&gt; blood pack &gt;&gt; stimpak &gt;&gt; diluted stimpak results in an absolutely stupid quantity of stims. The tick blood sacs give you the antiseptic you need too. Main other thing you need is a couple water purifiers at your camp.
---
What a relief to finally have an awnser.
---
 everyone in the F76 subreddit was wondering if user red-derringdo was going to do his NW challenges or not.
---
Yeah. Like I said though, still a good piece. And you could probably get an explosive plasma out of it (those were also heavily duped)
---
Many people who abused the dupe were banned so there's not as many as there could have been. But there are still a fair amount. The ban hammer came down pretty hard
---
There‚Äôs a lot more to Watoga now from wastelanders if you complete all the faction quests before picking a side and if you start the quest ‚ÄúNarrow Escape‚Äù by entering the Ash Heap then follow through the quests afterwards.
---
The rate of production of .50 is woefully slow fo rme too but I just assume thats how it is. I havent tested mine fully. I ended up switching to 5.56 which produces at a much more useful rate and resorting to the converter to keep a supply of .50 going
---
Oh lord, explosive plasmas was also getting duped? That's quite funny haha. I remember farming asylum for hours and hours, the rarest colour I got was pink :P
---
You do get the Kindred Spirit effect if you sleep in your camp with him assigned, so mechanically he‚Äôs just as good as the other two. With the downside of less RP, if that‚Äôs your goal.
---
One of the challenges is to place your camp. Takes two seconds.
---
Absolutely, a casual should not care actively about maxing all Legendary perks. They will get three level 1 Legendary Perks just from reaching 50, 75 and 100. Adding another 10% damage or DR here and there should not matter to the average player. But enemies will still explode when they hit them, and they will still be able to unlock picklocks without changing their perks.
---
Na when I do vendor hopping, public teams are my best friends and cap saver for the vendors lol. I had also several times dudes in my public team that were doing the same. So don't worry haha
---
I love building, combine different things to make it unique and a challenge. What I dont like is that I always get new ideas lol
---
And decorating isnt really my thing
---
This sounds oddly accurate
---
I really liked it when people used mine, but I didn't get much foot traffic in the savage divide, moved it next to flatwoods, almost all the plans are 50c. Still not seeing much traffic though, thinking I might need more neon signs
---
Nice. 
---
Unrelated,
---
 I started playing NW about 2 weeks ago.  Just had 2 back to back games where I placed 3rd and 4th by sitting in a bush not moving.  The winners aimbot apparently only locks on to moving targets until he changes some setting or something, same guy both times getting 30 plus kills per match.  Reported him, hope others did too but doubt anything will come of it.
---
I've heard there were a lot of hackers on PC but after 2 weeks that's the first time I've encountered it.  Pretty dumb shit lol.
---
It's very annoying!! Water wheel wasn't fixed for months... Can't imagine this will.
---
They give you daily(ish) quests (noticed since patch 20 I've been getting the quests much more regularly). The one where you retrieve a weapon case gives you a random 1-3* legendary weapon. I personally like Raider Punk the best because he also gives you quests to kill the Mothman and Flatwoods Monster, plus his dialogue in camp doesn't annoy me like astronaut lady and he doesn't constantly play guitar.
---
I'm always a little disappointed when it's just a big square
---
I love the scenery in the game. The photomode and camera features makes it so much better. It‚Äôs like a vacation in a game... with angry things trying to kill you. But the mountains are lovely.
---
The projector does light up, it‚Äôs just very dim. And you can‚Äôt have any lights near it.
---
I also just started 76 this week and have already put 24hrs in the game. I stupidly just followed one of the overseer quests all the way to this giant mine with level 30 off enemies (think they were some sort of miners) bearing in mind i was still level 10 with barely any ammo. A kindly High ranked player helped me clear the base then messaged me on my Xbox to inform me I was being an idiot and should focus on the lower rank quests before trying stupid stuff like that. Every random ive ran into has either gifted me things or just passed me by, still not even been shot at or hit yet. Seems to be an overall wholesome community

Camp Building Tips
---
https://youtu.be/BUFz1I7uKjU
---
Definately. This game is a post apocalyptic walking simulator
---
They've got ranged and close attacks, I had such trouble going through wendigo cave back at level 50
---
Got to get thoose repair kits
---
Have you played the game recently? Or at all?
---
Outside the forest everyone is a potential target lulz
---
I thought the post was referring to like the proper gay ass rp that folk do, not the usual stuff that happens in the game. Jesus man
---
Godmode in building - the magic carpet (rug)
---
It is sad when I fast travel there and it is this huge building so you know it is sparse on the inside. What's the point of that?
---
My minor grief is when you try to put posters/pictures on the outside walls, said poster/picture seems to float.
---
If you‚Äôre going melee go for unarmed it‚Äôs the most OP, i just started a new character as a bloodied unarmed and it is so much fun just one shotting everything. I use a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet that does around 1500 base damage without food buffs and a vampires puncturing power fist and never die because of the health regen. There‚Äôs so much food that gives 20 and 30 percent melee damage you destroy everything in your path, it‚Äôs a blast. Just make sure to get defensive perks like blocker, dodgy, and serendipity because it‚Äôs such close quarter combat
---
On an unrelated note, I hear therapy is pretty popular these days.
---
I'm the type who picks up everything that's not bolted to the floor so I would like more carry weight but i dont really want to use the excavator pa. But now that you point out that it needs vault steel and legendary modules I am not really as keen on spending all that gold. My legendary scrip is going to be spent on 3 star ranged weapons until I get what I want so none of that stuff for me. I'll just have to stick with my expensive-as-fuck ultracite power armour.
---
You keep everything you've unlocked. You can no longer use the tent, and you cannot add items to the scrap box, but your junk can be removed and any crafting/repairing you do will take from it.
---
I usually make mine one or two rooms, then maybe like a patio for instruments and vendors
---
Ironic thats exactly what everybody is doing fucktard
---
I remember going to the top of the world and finding a three star sheepsquatch.
---
Level 20 me died trying to go up the elevator but apparently Rose didn't trust me enough...
---
I bought it 6 week ago. Playing it everyday.
---
good to know, thanks!
---
&gt;A power armor set should be just that, a set. No mix or matching.
---
Now that I think about it that was a bit weird
---
I've been looking everywhere... I was way too generous and gave the only one I've ever been able to find to another friend who was looking for it.
---
Really sets in the immersion, huh. Ahahaha
---
Only SH needs steel and modules. T-65 is only expensive in terms of bullion.
---
But yeah, excavator + calibrated shocks = 200lbs of extra carry weight. Until they bring PA backpacks, no other PA can compete with that imo.
---
21-jul-2020, this bug is still active. A friend  had to open the elevator door for me. I still had the card for the basement laser grid door, weird.
---
Everything that could be sold to a vendor bot got duped
---
I was lucky and finally got my hands on a je plasma and a je flamer after 2 years of building up trade stock and still not being able to get them haha
---
Yeah true but I get treasury notes from killing the scorched queen so maybe I'll have enough some day by I dont really like grinding forever so it iant high on the list.
---
Oh right, that sounds quite broken, for about a year and a half I've had a tse flamer, be lazer pistol, fe gatling plasma. Luckily all of these I got quite cheap back in the day, quite funny duping is still a thing though
---
Awesome thanks for clarifying!
---
Saw the same thing with 2 trash cans at ohio River adventure. Watched them for a solid 5 minutes just flying around
---
Yes. My mate used the skin today, now his camp does not show at all on the map, with or without items for sale. He can't even see his own camp now. He had to place his tent near his camp just so he could get back home. Unreal.
---
They can keep the last rewards exclusive but due to the bugs that prevent others from getting even the lower level rewards they need to do something.
---
Just asking because your opinion sounds like it‚Äôs based off beta hate videos. The difference now is night and day. You can‚Äôt go far without running into npc random encounters and quests. Even the community has surprised me now more than ever if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing!
---
I just "bought" this structure and trying to put the garage door in place was a pain in the ass.
---
Blood eagles usually have quite a few if you farm their low level outposts
---
Yeah before the dupe I had gotten a be, Fe, Tse, Ve plasma. And be, Ve flamers. It took a lot of farming and trading to get all of them haha. Now they're semi common. Which I don't really mind, I enjoy the guns and am sure many others will now be able to enjoy them as well
---
Angry Turtle is the best Fo76 youtuber.  He had a video titled "FPS Fixes" and the description has some custom .ini settings. He also shows how to set your graphics card settings to get more performance.
---
I would get yourself too down about that. I did the same. Also just a tip for future characters. You can actually get the small backpack plan at the airport to hold you over until you do the pioneer quest.
---
I'm sure you could get someone to let you revive them. Just ask in here and someone will likely help
---
Im only level 19 but i'd take it aha, GT:TheDarkFr1ght
---
If not, its still a really cool thing to do for someone
---
at level \~200 a lv30something with a deathclaw gauntlet, hopping around and slashing holes in my PA, after me any my buddy (\~100) relieved his teammate (\~20) from a bounty ... was a whole group of "lowbies" but was like blasting away at killerrabbits...
---
Yeah, I was kind of expecting this for the red dress in the future ngl, quite sad about it, but not much you can do
---
I‚Äôm also a bloodied unarmed and I can tank anything she can take any damage from her except I get a lot of rads being underneath her. Just use blocker(blocks 45% of melee attacks), dodgy(blocks 30% of all incoming damage at the cost of AP which has perfect synergy with action boy), and serendipity. Turns you into a straight tank.
---
If you were in a public team at the time, you're able to loot it if one if your teammates tagged it.
---
Thanks, I looked all through the wiki for junk items and didnt see anything like what you described aside from the steins
---
Mine looks like a cube tower monstrosity from the outside but I've tried to theme it slightly, ground floor is vendor's, Daguerre (in BOS gear) and 2 power armour stations. 2nd floor is workbenches, 3rd floor is Recreational area and 3 dorm rooms. Tried to give it a bit of a BOS feel
---
Yeah the only bummer about it, for me anyway, is now instead of people being like wow amazing that you have that. They all now think it's just something you got for cheap cuz of the dupe haha
---
Back in the day when i was low level no one did this. So i used to snipe the queen from a distance
---
It's a shame tbh
---
my main is a heavy gunner and after a long time in X-01 the upgrade to T-65 IS worth it. i last longer in nukezones with fewer rad aways, and can take MORE punishment.
---
Why can‚Äôt you revive anyone? Just follow low level players around and revive them when the inevitably get downed
---
Yeah, i'm bloodied and there's people sometimes with only 10% health. If they go in a nuke zone they gotta use radaway and lose their damage
---
Honestly, I go to public events. People need reviving left and right, depending on the event. Particularly the Encryptid Event in the Ash Heap.
---
Finally. An awesome picture that lives up to the hype!
---
If you wanna talk about frustrating camp things, the most recent changes to camps also patched out the shelf glitch.
---
I was rebuilding my camp the other day and was super disappointed to find out that I couldn't make decorated shelves, or clip a pressure plate in to the base of my radiation arches or anything like that. I spent over an hour trying to make it work, even on a character who literally has decorated shelves at their camp already. Gave up, and have touched my main's camp since. 
---
Super frustrating, I wouldn't have tried to rebuild from scratch if I'd known that was going to happen.
---
It also seems that bashing 76 in YT has also gone out of style, which is nice
---
I feel ya. I dont even have a door on my CAMP and people hang out a while.
---
I agree to an extent! But even just by grinding the 100 score for 10k xp I think I'd be touching level 30 already and I play most days for a couple hours only. So I'm by no means a super grinder.
---
I can die for you, if you are on PC.
---
Are you kidding me? I love people who take a jab at me when Im checking out vending machines. Easiest kills ever, free junk and they get super pissed and salty over their stupidity.
---
It used to be busy all the time when legendary protectrons still spawned, and before that when vendor inventories were randomized. Then they made vendor inventory static and nerfed the bots. 
---
It's been a ghost town ever since.
---
The sheepsquatch on the couch is the most clutch thing I will ever see.
---
another victim of preston garvey needs help
---
They're all the same sorta size.
---
The worse thing is I complete understand why but at the same time I feel like if someone made a group saying ‚Äúmen only group‚Äù it would be frowned upon.
---
Maybe frowned upon by some people, not me though idgaf. It‚Äôs for no reason other than I miss having a girl gang in a gaming community.
---
I see you everywhere.

Take my upvote just for being a Responder.

I tried before I‚Äôm on PS4 I did get one person but they asked me to send PSP info and I don‚Äôt understand what that means so I never got the help I‚Äôm still learning how to play online which is so different for me. I‚Äôm a massive fan of all the games and I eventually started F76 because it was clear that that was going to be the only game beth was  going to release. I‚Äôm enjoying it more now
---
That‚Äôs kind but I‚Äôm PS4 thank you though
---
Why does it say my post was removed?
---
Most Gold Extractors were destroyed for Wastelanders. Was probably the Secret Service...
---
lol
---
all g man
---
They just need your gamer tag or what ever you call it in ps4 so they can look you up and join you
---
Wait there are pets?
---
Can you craft new scrap boxes?  Rather, if you scrap your scrapbox to move your CAMP, do the resources remain?
---
They at least could've added the clean mascot suit to the reward pool...
---
Event rewards is a good way.I seem to loot most of my stims of body's of scorched ghouls
---
The entire world of fo76 is full interesting places but are basically pointless because everyone ded
---
Since when
---
The way events work, if the event is centered on your camp then you would not be able to visit your camp while it is going on, without joining the event.  And even if you avoided your camp, another player could join to defend your base, triggering movs who would proceed to damage your camp in the ensuing fracas.
---
I like that last picture. Looks like it could have been in the movie, Session 9.
---
Y‚Äôall act like there‚Äôs no men‚Äôs only clubs out there lmao. There are so many reasons why women would only want to play with women, what‚Äôs the issue with that? Just the same as there are many reasons men might only want to play with men. Stop playing the gender card and realise that not everyone gets offended about this kind of stuff
---
The patriotic vault boy mask includes a massive uncle Sam hat. It is not the same size.
---
I've seen this a lot. I guess it's coming back to new players not knowing as it doesn't tell you and old returning players that remember that you had to use the red box and the capture point being a 3 inch square around it haha
---
Captital g Gamers moved on to tlou2, and then realise will move to the next thing and the next and so on forever.
---
very nice, a reason to get 500 atoms back. &lt;3
---
Some of them may be rare but that's the reason most people want them, not because they are actually good.  I mean a plain dress is hardly cool wasteland attire.  Now the forest camo jumpsuit....
---
Upvoted as I concur totally with the social observations.
---
And to the OP- for real we do have some awesome people on F76 in time you'll also get burned by selfish people that, rather than tag a legendary and let it live long enough for everyone to get a hit on it (and thus, the legendary loot drops for everyone), they'll have you CARRY the event *cough cough Fasnacht cough* while hiding and then kill the legendary before anyone who participated can get a chance. They'll also let you run events all day while they use a rubber banded controller to spin in place and just collect rewards for all the ammo and time YOU spend. 
---
Not to mention you'll deal with a bunch of adds on a weak 'horde' event while some ass fast travels in and goes for the legendary kill just to get their 'SCORE' points--fucking you over in the process. However those people forget some of us can manually aim very quickly... Sorry son - you spent caps for nuthin tryin to jump my event. (Can't believe I actually saw this thanks to SCORE and 'Kill 3 Legendary' as I've NEVER seen anyone doing these events). 
---
So yeah.... Good and bad in everything and don't trust *everybody* in Appalachia.
---
Proof?
---
Nope I left Preston Garvey back in 4. 
---
I personally wouldn't enjoy having to keep going back to defend camp. Workshops defence are bad enough just randomly showing up.
---
I barely count these npcs as people. They have no substance. There‚Äôs only like 3 different new quest lines and while there‚Äôs a couple factions it makes absolutely no difference story wise which you side with. After the quests are over they just essentially stop existing as anything other than a stationary bot. Meg literally never moves at the end of the quest and only says the same 3 lines. The ONLY kinda interesting and well done npc was the smooth talker guy who takes you to the arena and they still ruined that somehow. Don‚Äôt dare compare these npcs with the ones from before and they had their own issues but these guys are practically a joke.
---
Rule 1 of camp building. if you get it to work. Don't mess with it. It won't work again. LOL
---
It used to be a really great PvP option against those pesky legacy and hacked weapon users; an ok, if buggy PvE gear. Now it's just sadly underpowered.   
---
With most of those guys gone though, I guess it's no longer needed..?
---
Does anyone know if we will have public teams with buffs even after the season? Might get that herd mentality if that's the case
---
I use that perk card that gives extra damage resistance for every agility point..not sure if it stacks w unyielding but I get 45 dr with that then add serendipity and need rage i seem to do o.k.also add buttress mod to your ss.armor gives e nice boost to d.r
---
I'm go play ROBLOX now üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶
---
As far as I know public teams are permanent.
---
Idk how but they managed to make the building worse than Fallout 4 lmao
---
This really isn't worth arguing about but why ask a question then act like you know the fucking answer?
---
I don't know, . . . I like it. Some of the toughest events happen there. The robobrain horde event is no joke.
---
Yes there are those selfish people in the game who have to flex their God their weapon but for the most part it is an awesome community. I enjoy helping the low lvl players. Just this weekend I helped out a lvl 9 with weapons armor chems and Stimson. Then had him tag along as I took him through the burrow, line in the sand and Westtek. By the time  I had to leave he was up to 25. He was so happy he could finally start adding pieces to his pa frame.
---
I ran an auto pistol build for ages on my main but after realising rifles do everything much better, I changed and haven't looked back.
---
I think the ranged weapon is decent for snipers until they get a fixer. I have no idea what the melee weapon is. I am working on that right now with a new character
---
Now luckily for me the Nerd Rage Proc your on about is near the beginning. PHEW!
---
Okay so it's actually a late proc. All the animations must run the animation before showing the next. When he kills himself at the beginning he had lots of animations lined up. So after he died, respawned and loaded back in it just appeared that Nerd Rage kicked in at Full Health but it was just a delayed queued animation.
---
wtf?  how does vats not work?  or why does vats not work?
---
I presume it never was intended to be reasonable in case with 7600h challenge. It's just a time counter, no more, no less.
---
Totally agreed on unrealistic expectations part though.
---
But if you look at that grindiness issue from another perspective, you'll see that's simply bethesda being bethesda:
---
It was grindy enough and already stupendously tedious in the first iteration when we were able to get 5 coins from scrapping gold cards. Majority of us testers pointed that out. And they made it several times worse in the next iteration completely ignoring the necessity to fix the most glaring issues of that system. As if it wasn't enough negative feedback in the first place...
---
Yea really needs a counter card...... something stupid like - Deeply rooted "100 dr/er when your not jumping like an ahole
---
I get the benefit (+INT, XP, stat boost), regardless of your participation.
---
It's a permanent feature, and this is only the first season.
---
There's really no down side to Herd Ment at the moment. Just start a team everytime you drop into a world.
---
Shush!
---
You think 4 has better characters? Who
---
Your negativity is a joke and you didn‚Äôt mention a spoiler alert.
---
(Suddenly your account gets banned for exploits) üòÇ
---
They said that some rewards will be in the atomic shop.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
That'll be the answer then! Thanks for the help - this is good to know for future.
---
I just placed my camp module then repeated the process over and over until it was done then I built my actual camp üëç
---
Yes I know...... But I'm hoping they change their mind.
---
Plus..... People are paying thousands of atoms to get to level 100.......Will be a travesty of the late rewards end up in the atomic shop far cheaper.
---
I thought so too about herd mentality but now i looked and it says your teammates have to be close :S
---
Edit: in the item description it says so but not when you got the mutation. Come on bethesda
---
Bashing damage and 33% Vats are both considered "magic" effects because of bugs. Instigating is another example.
---
I had an Instigating explosive minigun, but I got rid of it because it removes the challenge of the game.
---
How about text chat?
---
Did you ever think of leaving the quest line for a bit and leveling up more?
---
Since the benefits of PA are now almost indistinguishable from a decked out regular armor set, I'd love to see them make a "fully powered" extra mod slot for torsos. You could go ahead and collect a bunch of microfusion cells and create a single pack at a tinkerers bench, or create your own fission reactor and hook it up to your X-01 then never have to use another darn fusion core again. It just lasts forever. Half my beef with PA is having cores take up my inventory space. It's never worth it, and my marine armor is nearly just as good with the right perks.
---
If you leveled up beta you have to restart for the trophies it was to promote new characters for an even playing field at launch
---
I hope that chicken also produce some eggs for a nice omelette. Or it is just chicken poo we get?
---
I‚Äôm 100% with him on this. I put extremely serious work into my camps and focus putting through most important stuff in close proximity to spawn in, but have enough cool design to inspire a real exploratory visit.
---
When I visit other people‚Äôs camps I always will use a persons benches when I like they have I also always try to spend money on their vendors if I like their camps.
---
Daguerre. it‚Äòs honestly not that hard and fucking ignorant of y‚Äòall, lmao.
---
**I need to see this.**  
---
What platform are you on?  
---
I'm on PS4, and seriously.. 
---
If the ride returns to the Atom Store, I want to make this happen!
---
I tried switch off the worst and going to do other stuff but everywhere I went they appeared. They were from Rollins Prison. I left the game and reloaded and theyre gone. üò§üò§üò§
---
The real question is who plays with passive mode off
---
Go do something else for a lil bit. Wait till you're level 25. And go back. Should be way easier.
---
At least they felt alive and didn‚Äôt seem to exist solely for the one quest relevant to them.
---
Don‚Äôt give up dude, if your on Xbox I‚Äôd be happy to give you everything you need to progress and give you some backup along the way
---
I only go there to sell shit after a queen fight, looking for a particular item or doing a kill robot challenge. But yeah, that city has been abandoned otherwise.
---
Omg. This sounds amazing
---
Magic damage, watch angry turtle videos to gain more knowledge on the subject
---
Yeah they‚Äôre decent. Not the best so they‚Äôre good starter weapons. They‚Äôre not worth leveling to 50 to redeem.
---
respawn at vaut 76 and forget about the dropped junk (you always just drop your junk. weapons, aid and so on are still in the inventory.).  
---
then level up and in some time, show these fuckers whom they messed with.  
---
and dont forget to swear bloody revenge. make it your duty to kill every single blood eagle, everywhere you go.
---
Call me negative but you didn‚Äôt refute what I said so
---
It's just super bugged in pvp. Vs other enemies is should work just fine
---
No idea, but that is why you don't take anyone on that has an explosive laser.
---
Some legendary effects are broken boosting your damage way over the intended amount. Check magic legendary effects from YT -- Angryturtle explains it pretty clearly.
---
Shotguns are broken in VATS dealing massive damage due to what people speculate is the part of the same glitch affecting magic weapons (firerate calculation, in the case of shotguns, multiple pellets hitting the enemy simultaneously).
---
Lever-Action rifles deal hefty damage per shot, but when you're fighting an enemy like the SBQ or ISS they start to fall behind.
---
With the right build, mutations &amp;c Bloodied automatic rifles still reign supreme with legit DPS and the Fixer is the best of the lot. Hold on to it dearly.
---
Its  health goes down it just hels back up really quick until it's vulnerable.
---
I was over at line in the sand last night and heard some people talking, I never ended up much joining the chat myself but the banter and friendliness between everyone had me smilin
---
Enforcer rank 1+ shotgun+ target legs = poor harmless sheepsquatch laying on the ground. I think they should make him immune to cripple honestly
---
Same things happens if you‚Äôre lying in their bed, except you just slide around on the floor
---
I agree, that hanging tree is pretty sweet.
---
It makes it a slightly darker black. Ok effect on rifles, BIS for turtleknecks.
---
Yes, this is the reward you get for finishing up her quest line.
---
The VATS Unknown is a guaranteed reward at the end of her questline, yeah.
---
He isn‚Äôt arguing, I don‚Äôt think. I, however, am genuinely confused at why you brought up the size of the masks when he never brought that up. 
---
He asked if the regular vault boy mask was in the game to which you gave an answer that was... questionable.
---
lol, was singing this in my head
---
Not dure if you're joking, but obviously Beth wouldn't tell their base to do something so they know you're exploiting their game :)
---
That's rather lovely!  This is why we need a server text chat on PC  :-( 
---
.... and so i can announce 'sale events' at my vendors when I'm full again!
---
I just mean there is no proof this would get you banned. It's more likely they will just remove it from camps or force camps to "no longer be deployed" when they do fix it. My point is no use fear mongering that it will get you banned when there is no proof.
---
If anyone ever finds one that has a ground floor museum of teddy bears. That'll be mine üëç
---
The wayward quests, raiders, settlers, two ally quest lines, plus the two greater evils, blood eagles and mothman cultists, add a lot of dynamic to the game. It‚Äôs just the start too. The BOS is coming soon and I believe they‚Äôre going to react to player decisions made. Current NPCs say more than enough if you make the right decisions and they don‚Äôt say anymore because at this moment we‚Äôre in the middle of a larger story coming later this year.
---
It makes no sense I have had it sitting for a few hours &amp; have a grand total of 43 it is definitely bugged. For 5mm I'd have many hundreds by now.
---
Just because it is happening to everyone does not mean it isn't a bug
---
Trying to do that caused me to get stuck with a floating foundation connected to a staircase and the ground none of which can be removed anymore..
---
I heard they were going to fix it but that was when it first got noticed. I haven't heard a peep since
---
Not just you!
---
Imagine turning up at a Queen fight and dropping down a blueprinted bandstand.
---
12 people fighting the Queen while the other 12 play "Ride Of The Valkyries"!  Epic!
---
Well if it is indeed a bug or oversight I honestly cant figure out how the fuck they manage to screw up one but not the others
---
Npcs just teleport around my house anyway, even the super Mutants who are attacking!
---
I asked if the non patriotic mask was in the game. I already said in the post that I had the tricentennial one.
---
Yes, please! The Blue Ridge Caravan Company is one of my favourite factions in the game.
---
Really hope Bethesda adds some more content for them in future updates!
---
Which is exactly why having Foundation and Crater as free travel points are not game breaking things to have.
---
FEV is a helluva drug!
---
I do it too. I already have 3 free-travel point (Vault 76, CAMP, TENT). But more is even better.
---
Ah thanks guys i wasn't sure
---
It's just one of the perks!  There's no need to feel guilty about it.
---
My camp is in the South and my tent is in the North, purely to save caps.  Both are there for anyone to use!
---
4 makes combat for atari feel like a live exciting world.
---
Gotcha. I say go for it, but whatevs :) Free ammo is always a good deal in my book
---
I sometimes sleep in other people's beds. Not sure if they are cool with that. But what are they going to do? Shoot me?
---
I mean I'm pretty sure that's just how it's always been. If you're not happy go to bethesda about it.
---
Did this just the other day. Spent hours building up a Red Rocket farm. Wanted to place turrets on the roof as a final move. Stuck a foundation and stairs outside to jump up from. Guess what happened when I was done... Yep. ‚ÄúDo you want to move your camp?‚Äù -YES.
---
They've banned people for glitches into inaccessible places,both accidentally and intentionally. There's no proof they wouldn't ban them for glitching assets that don't belong
---
Ok ok ok ok so i was playing more fo76 and again it keeps on happening why i dont know whyyyyy is it a bug or something why cant i loot it üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
This is obviously the best answer.
---
Another happy landing
---
Ah cool, so we agree "There's no proof"
---
It's funny actually mine is just a wooden house it's not that pleasing from the outside, but when you walk in ohh boy is a wonderland
---
Ever so slightly more proof they would than wouldnt, an insignificant number though
---
I am way behind. üòÇü•∫
---
Yeah, since I use a legacy gatling plasma, the game is too easy, way too easy. When I manage to craft a gauss rifle that I want, Ill put the gatling plasma to my stash.
---
go for tyler county, the leader of the wolfpack event, low level legendary weapons and armor drop here from each of the 3 wolves you kill.
---
join events like uranium fever (mine near whitespring) and awol arments (robco) when you see them pop up and just shoot every enemy a few times and let other players kill them to gain experience points and collect legendary gear.
---
its all about the legendary weapons and  armor, once you find decent gear the game gets much easier, dont give up its worth it.
---
PS the levels 20-40 are the hardest in the game for everyone!
---
yes, you can place a new scrap box. you just can't access it to store new scrap in it. after i got just a month to try it out, amd that month ended, i would still put up a scrap box in my camps for any 1st members who wandered by and needed it.
---
It‚Äôs actually not too bad. At least you don‚Äôt have to worry about faction rep and whatnot. 
---
Plus, it‚Äôs nice to experience both versions of the raid. They‚Äôre fairly diffentc quests for the raid itself.
---
I enjoy doing that too. I have a strip center on one character (a Bbq joint/solcums/redrocket) and a small town beside Morgantown that that character ‚Äúmayors‚Äù. Having multiple buildings makes me think I‚Äôm back in fall out 4 building cities again.
---
Who felt alive in 4? Lol
---
There is a PA helmet, or even a few more (like crossed eyes). Atleast I think they are PA helmets. They are big.
---
No, it isn‚Äôt, but you can price things however you want. I‚Äôm amazed someone paid that, unless they were trolling you. It‚Äôs becoming more common to rapidly buy up expensive guns to purposely send the seller over.
---
that's not what was happening to me. It just starts to lag like crazy and will sometimes just exist.
---
Started happening around patch 19. It was so unexpected that I even reinstalled windows until I felt how hot it was just above the keyboard.
---
I think either windows updated something or maybe Bethesda did to prevent duping, glitching, or what not.
---
You can buy as many as you want
---
Ideally you would have 5 cards of each. Giving you 1 star, 2 star, and 3 star variants
---
If you can max to three by only having 2(1 star) cards then I call that a blessing of a glitch
---
is it capped at 150? thats the max 50cal i found in it so far
---
This I would also like to help
---
i would do the wayward quest simce it's the new tutorial, then go to flatwoods and follow the vanilla questline. you'll be asked to talk to the overseer when you hit level 20, ignore that until you nuke fissure site prime (you should be around level 50 minimum when you get around to that).
---
but that's what *I* would do, on a new character. some prefer doing the vanilla and wastelanders quests in tandem, which is totally fine too.
---
I made one using the caboose based off an actual one in a little village not far north of where I live. It‚Äôs called the Loose Caboose Bbq and in mine I put Ace the raider Protectron as the cook. He only rarely says thing that don‚Äôt match the feel. I‚Äôve moved about three times thus far trying to find a better place but that caboose has remained the same each time.
---
Neither can I but they did
---
I do events enough to make up for dealing with that jackass üòÑ
---
Yes it has always been like that it was bugged from the start.
---
P.S
---
 I don't need your permission to post about it here
---
Great ideas!
---
I will check out the videos from angry turtle!  
---
i did keep the fixer, because on some day, bethesda might fix these issues, so i can revert back.
---
Guys this guy is just salty that PA is worse than regular armor in PVP, because he really seems like a sweaty pvper in a pve game. Just ignore him
---
I never got even that much
---
Maybe they just had to go? Because of life? Or they could be server hoping to farm xp. I doubt many people log off specifically because someone is in their vendor.
---
The thing frustrated me so much I just build my own garage
---
If you think thats strong just wait for ballistic mr gusty, mirelurk kings, and anglers.... those are the only ones i have  trouble if im not careful...
---
Wow. I didn‚Äôt know about solar armor. And you need to wear all 5 to get the regen?
---
I think God prefers to stay away from Bethesda. Lol
---
We need more Songs and proper way to select them... look at what sea of thieves did, that's awesome use of instruments.
---
it's when they dont even bother calling her Sofia that bothers me. like, you not only refuse to look up how to spell the last name, but dont bother learning the first name.
---
Also, they could be at max caps. I've had to bail twice while somebody was draining my vendors because they maxed me out.
---
Git gud
---
Yes. From what I understand you unlock a slot at 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300. Once unlocked you can use all six slots on all of your characters, but you have you unlock the cards again by scrapping cards on that character.
---
Imagine thinking this is deliberate.
---
"Hehe, know what would be hilarious? Me, losing out on a sale. Fucking genius."
---
Go away. ü§£
---
Yep, if Beth ever gets those damage glitches fixed then those weapons will be rendered fairly useless again.
---
I say I‚Äôd gotten about 6-7 plans In total.  Roughly about 40-50 event runs.
---
The hornwrights really need to stop leaving keycards around
---
Im not wating for you to check fed76 to cost out my legos.  You know how many people sit on a vendor for 20min or afk after FT.
---
What about people that use perk points to move special points? They are at a disadvantage because they now have less cards to scrap.
---
its actually been top 40 on most played since before gamepass fyi, it was above Gears 5 and Halo 5 which was surprising
---
The vanity of a challenge? Lmfaooo. The game is super easy any way you run it. Being bloodied is nice and all for obvious reason but it‚Äôs literally god mode. It‚Äôs stupid, it makes the game cheesy and every enemy is just a joke. All the right perks make you basically invincible, add unyielding armor and you have 3-4x the special stats than a full health build. How does that even sound fun? Especially when everybody else is doing it. And how is that even balanced? The argument used to be the low health, but low health is actually better! It just seems so dumb to me. Being bloodied is only for taking down the queen at least that‚Äôs how I see it. Every other enemy in the game is already 1-2 shots without being low health build. I went bloodied for several weeks and it was a blast at first, loved it, thought I was the shit like everyone else. Then I realized I never die, everything else does, and I found myself using shitty pipe rifles at events so I don‚Äôt one shot everything, but I still basically was because of all the low health perks. Idk man people have their opinions on bloodied and none of them are really wrong but I think it‚Äôs cheap and boring, it‚Äôs lazy. Pick the right perks and you‚Äôre literally able to pick up any weapon and shred enemies because of the low health perks plus adrenal reaction. I like to rely on my own reflexes and situational awareness to win battles not vats pew pew oh look everything just fell to the ground yay I‚Äôm having fun. If that‚Äôs fun to you, fantastic. That‚Äôs not why I play fallout. Sorry to reply to your comment from weeks ago, I somehow stumbled upon the post and it intrigued me and just wanted to share another opinion and experience on why some players don‚Äôt play bloodied since apparently it baffles people that not everyone wants to be god...
---
I don‚Äôt grind either myself and I‚Äôm down to needing just the arm plans for my junkies heavy and bloodied heavy.  
---
T65 is worth it if u play with PA.
---
Imo selling plans for 5 caps each is a waste of time and stash space, so i usually do 10% or bit more of its price
---
Why? As long as your camp isn't hovering over a cliff it does you no harm.
---
Ummmm..serious, when I have to leave the game I can‚Äôt wait for someone to take 10 minutes to browse my wares.
---
New gorge resort at least 5 spawn there kill, server hop repeat
---
where is that?
---
I've waited for players at my Vendors and  yes you'll get the occasionally idiot who will log off to stiff you, but it also works the other way. I've seen players AFK at my machines, or be so slow they may as well be. No one should take more than a couple of minutes to look over just 3 vendors. I have an offline life too folks! 
---
If you take away the option to log off when someone's at your Camp you can effectively be at the mercy of being stuck in some idiots half hour AFK loop.
---
The scenery is great playing from my XBox on a 50" 4k TV.  Standing on a cliff overlook it seems quite real.
---
One thing I love in SSA is that you need almost nothing to repair it
---
Ummm...that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Why are you at Rollins Work Camp when the missing guards are at Gauley Mine?
---
Just west of Sutton station
---
That (among few other things) is one of the drawbacks of playing bloodied. Secret service armor has very high radiation resistance and helps alot to use one as bloodied, if you don't like the whole rad micromanage thing. Not to mention it's resistances are the best in the game right now (as normal armor). You will still need to manage rads with it but lot less. With unyielding armors thorn armor sneak bonus is not really needed. You don't even need sneak perk with the high agility we get.
---
Fixer plan drops again if u learned it.  No worries.
---
I probably do it this way then thank you.
---
Have u done that quest line?
---
Cool, thanks!
---
I had that happen to me a couple of days ago but being on a team I was able to go right back to the same server and get my loot.
---
I‚Äôm hoping more NPC‚Äôs will start to hang out there like the that girl who is obsessed with robots.
---
And I get it. I do think that some of it is a community and a developer both being unreasonable so it makes it hard to find legitimate middle ground.
---
As much as people were used to modding in Skyrim and the ES chapter, most the mods were visual overhauls, quality of life, new quests, bug fixes, things like that.... But they were predominantly moderate to reasonable levels of adjustment that brought diversity over instant win. This made the transition from ES to ESO a bit easier to adjust to. Especially since it was obviously defined at the time by comparison with other thematically similar rpg light MMOs like Warcraft.
---
So there's a massive divide even within the existing Fallout community kinda 4 ways;
---
 the OG legacy type that have loudly hated on everything to come out since tactics.
---
 the obsidian loyalists that have very strong nostalgia complex and have enshrined NV as pinnacle of gaming despite it's incredibly unavoidable issues (I'm sure I'll get 20 downvotes just for this).
---
Then you have Fallout 4 split - where half their mods are heavily cheat mods and overpowered more often than not, they're rarely balanced. This gave the average player more of a god like feeling and these people don't want to grind for absolutely anything and they've never had to in game. They never didn't have the most powerful weapons and armor in game, never had to struggle to find supplies, never had to consider cost of goods or maintaining personal character upkeep. To them 76 feels like everything is unfulfilled and a grind. So they're usually the ones who will rush after every exploit because they can't stand playing fallout without being able to one shot the SBQ. 
---
Lastly is those that wanted hardcore challenge from both FO3, NV and again in FO4 and would mod some or not at all, prefer more balaced gameplay went with survival mode. To them 76 is like kiddy wheels with no real legitimate survival elements and no real feeling of loss or lack of safety. They want deep pvp, where a character can be completely looted, where dying in the game feels meaningful and living in the wasteland is an impacting challenge where everything is earned through dedicated work or through vicious raiding. 
---
There's legitimately no way to make all 4 of those groups happy. So with every update they're immediately going to have unavoidable hate. So I think they just stopped listening, and that just is making them take these weird turns thinking they know better.
---
When they listen and try to work out reasonable accomodations that try for best of all worlds, no one is truly satisfied but it's definitely better. I think the choices to legendary perks are an example of this, but their implementation and achievements still seem unbalanced with likely reality. Hopefully it will adjust a bit before final release and not just need to be another thing to fix down the line like the ammo convertor.
---
that‚Äôs some robert capa photography! well done!
---
I made a train
---
Im not getting any glands. How do i get them
---
If Beths fixes it, they need to buff shotguns because they are useless without the ‚Äúperks‚Äù.  Not sure why they nerfed them into the ground in the first place.  I guess they want you to use only a few types of weapons and create even more issues obtaining decent weapons, ect...
---
I fully believe there will be a massive spike coming up with the player base.  The game as it's base is choc full of content.  Not to mention the Bethesda secret sauce that is the game loop.
---
Yes the end game can be a grind and not much to do other than wait on time released items.  But the end game is completely different to the first 60 or so levels.  
---
A lot of here know the potential.  Yes we have our frustrations too.  But this game is very unique and has a lot of soul.
---
Check out anywhere with Super Mutants, Wade Airport for example, and have a Rumble through their meat bags. I frequently see stings, glands, Radstag meat and similar items.
---
ok thx
---
it‚Äôs RNG, you just need to keep killing them
---
Just go full health for Encryptid?  Least that is what I do - I only use actual low health bloodied when I am xp grinding for the unyielding bonus.
---
I was lvl 27 when I was attempting to do belly of the beast solo with... excavator armor cause I valued high carry weight over protection....
---
Needless to say I couldn't get to the glassed caverns without a legendary SB running me down, used all my ammo to do 1/58th damage to it.
---
I mean, that's the whole point of bloodied. having said that, either sneak or PA. people complain about bloodied being OP all the time but you can't really play bloodied in regular armor. not reliably at least.
---
PA has a hidden damage reduction effect and sneak, well, sneak bypasses all damage. assuming you can stay hidden at all times. just you wait until you have to deal with poison and fire damage.
---
bolstering will be of little help by the way. all the dr in the world wouldn't save you at 20% health. focus on damage reduction instead, lone wanderer, dodgy, ricochet, etc.
---
radiation is the bane of bloodied builds. you need some basic rad resistance to survive environmental rads, trapper and robot armor, leaded limb mods, lead lined backpack, etc. top it off with rad-x as necessary. and carry lots of both radaway and toxic goo. for nukes and radiation rumble you might as well just equip a css.
---
ok
---
Why does the last part make me smile
---
Very nice ‚ù§
---
Huntersville is a good place. Didn't find one in 4 hours and then when i went there i found 7 in 2 minutes.
---
hate those people. Aggressive punks who screw with people for sport. Why aren't they in NW?
---
If you want to browse when I want to go off or hop, you need to pay me real money.
---
Prime it and you‚Äôll have an excellent SBQ killer.
---
Funny you mentioned it. It happened to me a few times and now I always check if someone is at my camp before I log out. I try to do to others what I would like them to do to me, so I try to keep my vendor machines as convenient as possible. I try to keep all crafting stations, scrapbox and stashbox, water supply in the same room for those who fast travel to my camp now.
---
ok i got now how do i demonstrate pioneer scout values i have 3/4 but i dont know how to get them. What do I do for that.
---
the loading time feels so long.
---
I wish they'd let us queue from adventure mode. 
---
One moment i'm fighting a scorch beast and the next,i waking up in a prison.
---
I play bloodied after I got my 3 star grognak axe and switched everything around. There is a lot of dying during certain events but I use unyielding secret service armor which puts damage resistance up to 340 which helps and I still need to change some perks around. Being I am 8 luck 5 agility 11 intelligence 5 charisma 5 endurance 8 perception and 15 strength.
---
The stairs is attached to it. You can‚Äôt remove foundations like that when you have something on its sides.
---
Thanks, the above method wasn't working but setting it to read only did the trick.
---
haha, absolute approval!
---
What's next? SBQ is setting up a retirement home there?
---
Not sure but I've heard roaming bands of miscreants  keep breaking it to steal coat hangers, lamps, and to just beat down the guards
---
All five of my characters are well over level 100. (Something like 130, 150, 225, 250 and 300) The reason I have played them all is that I want to build new CAMPs without loosing my old ones.
---
Finally somebody with the guts to help! (..a settlement in need)
---
The pioneer scouts quests and yes it does stack.
---
I threw it on the GROUND! I don't need their hand outs, I'm an adult!
---
it's clutter, useless. Try to sell it for 1000 caps in your vendor, profit!
---
It‚Äôs not.
---
No one is talking about it, but duped weapons are being removed from players inventories.
---
Lovely I will now try to aim for that
---
Have you done the Tadpole questline? Check this writeup:
---
[https://twinfinite.net/2019/05/fallout-76-backpack-mods-how-get-what-do/](https://twinfinite.net/2019/05/fallout-76-backpack-mods-how-get-what-do/)
---
Are you on PS4? If so I think I visited your camp once and it was totally sweet!
---
You can only have 1 mod on the backpack. The extra carry mod lowers your resistance and costs 5 possum badges.
---
Wonder if this works with the rocket ride too
---
I think 60 is the basic carry weight for the highest level backpack? unless you're talking about the small one you get at the beginning of the game.
---
if so, do the tadpole quest for the regular backpack. there's also a high capacity mod that adds another 60, totaling 120 extra carry weight.
---
That's why ppl set them up at workshops on there private server. I seen a guy with about 40 at each workshop.
---
press start and then whatever button it is for menu
---
go down to challenges then down to world
---
Look for tadpole. You have to do 3 of those. It may look daunting but it's really not. Took me less than 2 hours. I did Archery, Swimming and Athletics. 
---
If you do swimming you need to find the camera. You use your personal terminal to investigate the strange person. Hardest part of the 3 challenges is finding someone to revive in water. Just ask here.  Someone will help. 
---
IF you do archery do not make a crossbow. You can find one at the palace of winding paths.
---
If you're on Xbox dm me and I'll come help you out
---
#itjustworks
---
Yup, need all 5. 
---
It has no rad resist and you have to buy mods from MODUS and some of them can‚Äôt be attached...
---
Honestly it‚Äôs kind of fucked.
---
But I‚Äôm stubborn.
---
Lead lined backpack for me.
---
Oooh thanks!
---
I started having this problem with the ammo convertor yesterday. Some new contagious bug per chance?
---
The negative effect of the empath mutation is that you take 25% more damage, not 33%. I think you got 33% from the wiki, which is wrong. As the other post mentioned, you count as your own teammate, so the negative and positive effects cancel if you‚Äôre on a team, and with Class Freak you get damage reduction from your own mutation.
---
Precisely! I do this too. I hate to loose a nice CAMP just to build a new one.
---
It is possible to place a tent on a tent. So basically you can place it as high as you want
---
Huntersville is my go to place to do the stings, wings and things quest.
---
 Numerous times I have found all parts just sitting in the meat sacks.
---
I can‚Äôt use rad X can‚Äôt stand my mutations disappearing.
---
You can only level up to 15 points in a category but can select as many cards as you want. If you are under level 50 and already have one of your SPECIAL slots at 15, select a different category when you level up and then tab over to the card you want. For example, you want to select the super duper card but your luck is maxed out. Select something else such as agility when you level up. Then press RB (Xbox), L1 (PS4), whatever it is on pc, until you get to the special section of cards. Now you can select super duper. 
---
It‚Äôs more intuitive after level 50
---
I have the basic 30 one but I read it‚Äôs possible to get a 60 weight one and if so does it allow me to apply the chemist mod
---
Only for Wastelanders, then it dropped out of the top 50.
---
they're not. weapons disappearing is an old issue the never gets enough traction because it's hard to replicate and highly dependent lag.
---
basically the server desyncs and thinks you're doing something you're actually not. like you open your pipboy, and then close it. except the server desyncs and thinks you still have your pipboy open.
---
then you press reload, which is also the drop button. and so the server drops whatever was last highlighted in your pipboy. you'll only notice it one you fast travel or relog.
---
similar things can happen when selling, scriping, storing, repairing, etc.
---
when I'm at player's camp, firstly i look around for cool decorations like collection of stuffed bears, nuka whatever, magazines, mounted heads, rugs and get awe with it. after that vendor machine time.
---
It is gone and I'm only warning others. Its not duped. I got it from the purveyor a few mouths ago. 
---
Maybe it got flagged as duped somehow? I don't know. But I'm only warning people.
---
I‚Äôve heard to fix that one have to install the game on your main boot drive. 
---
If you downloaded it on another drive while using your boot drive separately it does that.
---
I saw someone level 1000+  and had equal thoughts of envy and pity :).
---
dilute it my man
---
Even with WL, the game is starved for depth and content. Watoga got ziltch with WL. Two instanced interiors you can enjoy one time each during specific quest stages..
---
I've been playing since Beta.
---
No i checked a few weeks ago and even before wastelanders, it was in top 40 most played in the xbox store section
---
Oh true didn‚Äôt realise that worked, cheers.
---
So I have to do the world challenges to increase ranks then increasing carry weight?
---
Rename it then üòÅ
---
usually hacker
---
I don‚Äôt think that word means what you think it does
---
I hit 500 y-day , i assume they think im a nolifer. Wife + kids + work but was on sick leave because of my knee (not an arrow)  at release for 10.months
---
I‚Äôve had several associates who had weapons mysteriously disappear...but only the ones that would have been highly duped (explosive fixers, doubles, etc).
---
It‚Äôs too much of a coincidence....
---
that's probably my favorite time spent so far, the dicking around exploring
---
As far as I know, yes. You can also do the Campfire Tales event to earn tadpole tokens.
---
Xbox sorry dude
---
The high capacity mod sounds great.  Adds 60 extra carry weight but when equipped you lose 60 energy and rad resistance.  Basically I carry an extra backpack on me with the mod and only equip it when I'm over encumbered and need to fast travel.  Using the chemists though cuts down my weight by nearly 60 pounds, so more or less the same net effect with no downsides
---
Pee war food, yum.  Salty
---
Yeah, the stairs wouldn't remove for the same reason...
---
They probably had a few bad guests and now don't want any...
---
I rarely go to other camps unless I am shopping
---
It's pretty good it just takes up a lot of space but it's worth it, it's also quite cosy
---
If you have a problem get a pipe rifle sniper and shoot their heads when sneaking. That basically solves problems for new players dying too much.
---
Oh okay so it‚Äôs a mod it‚Äôs pointless then I don‚Äôt wanna lose Dr or rr will just stick to the chemist one
---
Atom shop
---
I mean, I'm not saying that's not the case. it's possible. but unless Bethesda just started doing that, it's definitely the same old issue that's plagued the game since release.
---
I avoid SBQ fights altogether now due to the number of people reporting their guns missing after the event.
---
gear disappearing for no reason whatsoever other than the servers and the netcode being \*.
---
These are disappearing out of stashes, not on the person.
---
I think people aren‚Äôt talking about it as much, as cause they are afraid of being accused of duping.
---
Nothing more dangerous than a bush wookie in the final 10 who picks up a weapon.
---
Game crash on first nuke happens to everyone! Pretty sure it's intended at this point...
---
i have also found if you want to move the building within your camp, it has constant conflicts unless both doors are removed
---
Ah fuck that‚Äôs brilliant thank you
---
A long time ago I was at the Whitesprings station vendor and had been there about 6 seconds before somebody came in and started hitting me. They just kept going.
---
I finished up with the vendor, turned around to see two of them them sitting on the chair. So I headshot them and server hopped.
---
It's because they thought this game would be a rust clone and only be about pvp.
---
Exactly. Bethesda should give us a big Quality of Life update for these small things. But what annoys me the most are the hitbox issues with melee. Ranged attacks work just fine but most of the time playing melee characters is a pain.
---
Now if they just gave XP too, public teams would be fixed --- I wouldn't mind running for the irradiated ore if I wasn't passing up 26,000 ghoul xp to do it.
---
That already had a tracker system leftover from previous titles. Every Ghoul kill and flower picked is tracked by the game, but you can't see it. Someone disabled it and reinvented the wheel in the form of that smoothbrained challenge.
---
If blueprints were the issue then it wouldn't only be stairs, floors could be supported by walls alone. No, this is a problem because Bethesda believed people would exploit an inaccessible floor in pvp or pve (no doubt mostly in workshops) and irrationally decided it would be such a big problem that they would have to handicap the entire system to prevent it. 
---
Edit: to add to this, same reason all foundations have an obnoxious invisible ramp to ensure accessibility by npcs
---
so, what you are saying is I should stand around shooting it and then yell at everyone for not activating the pylons. instructions were unclear
---
It is a mod.  Can be applied to the standard and small backpack, the chemists backpack is also a mod though technically.  If you haven't done the scout stuff though for the full size backpack you should though since it gives you 60 extra carry weoght vs. 30.

Good to know. Thanks!
---
Level 1176 sighted during faschnat. Asian dude, pretty epic.....
---
That would be a close relative of mine then. I've completed SBQ at lvl 9 with a group of friends lol.
---
Indeed. Worst enemy to fight and no loot.
---
When did I mention anything about permission? I said if you're not happy about it go to bethesda üòÇ
---
In the words of the Almighty Todd: "It just works!"
---
#**16X DA DEEEEETAIL!!**
---
If you remove the skin, does your camp show back up?
---
It gave them for me. I just picked up 5 minutes ago. I had to serverhop once to refresh the balance, but it is good.
---
I either go full health and then drink dirty water to lower my rads again (if I am the conduit). Otherwise, if I am just shooting the imposter, I am sneaking and I am fine.
---
Yeah I got it right after wastelanders but mine was only level 25 I think. They ended up changing it to give higher level. Being I WAs level 160 I should‚Äôve gotten higher. So it‚Äôs useless. Final word is way better
---
Yes, it's a new backpack not a mod
---
There are two backpacks
---
The truth is they were never listening from the start.
---
Ringa-ding baby
---
To be honest, I rarely buy ammo from vendors. But if I saw lead scrap I‚Äôd buy it up! Not sure about other people though.
---
I had a similar experience as a higher level player battling a wendigo colossus. I burned through almost all my ammo and all stimpaks. 
---
After a while dying replaced stimpak. Scorch beasts and death claws were our allies in that fight. Was epic.
---
again, it's entirely possible. but if they moved said items recently, at all, even in the stash, then it could also be the server.
---
If you care about the people sell the ammo. If you care about yourself sell the scrap.
---
Yes you are correct
---
I have a friend that hit level 1000 a couple months ago, and he's mostly getting messages by random people in his lobbies like "Dude, teach me your ways." Or "How?".
---
I gave up and bought it
---
I have the uncle same one and leprechaun one.
---
at first they might be like "uff".  
---
but with time spend in the game, you realise its not that hard. i started like 4 months ago and got 180 today and im far away from maxing out every buff and just go xp hunting. i just enjoy the game and spend some time in it.  
---
i dont want to devalue the performance of high lvl players, its amazing and deserves huge tribute, you guys really love grinding :D
---
Because down syndrome
---
Road by abandoned bog town? I have a photo of a similar battle I came across.
---
Okay that‚Äôs what I wanted to know lol so it‚Äôs a whole new backpack not a mod
---
I think it is part of what is contributing to challenges auto completing, but hard to tell from the post.
---
Yeah, I get the same feeling lol it's usually after someone buys a gun or armour 
---
No one has yet to use my bar though I have a punch bowl and a Nukashine keg and no one has taken a drink from either
---
Gotcha. I am now debating Commando over Rifleman - I will have to move SPECIAL around.
---
I'm also debating just sticking with my Plasma for a while. I've spent a lot of time searching for Fixer and Handmade, and it seems all I get is Heavy Bloodied. Of course....
---
Its that god damn poison damage. Can not wait for legendary perks in next patch. Anti-Venom is going to be the first one I pick.
---
Well, I still have my explosive gatling plasma that I traded half year ago. It has 80% chance to be duped (in my defense, when I got it, I was not aware of dupeing issues).
---
So if you say it right, my weapon is not duped. Or it is under the radar.
---
~~erm.... you are aware of the fact, that the small backpack is not modable?? you have to get the regular one by doing the tadpole quest to be able to mod it.~~  
---
edit: TIL the small backpack can have some mods too, see post below
---
Is it easily fixed though? Like if this was a game made from scratch i could see that being true but this is a hacked together gamebryo engine that was never made for multiplayer.
---
Sneaking and standing on certain objects will make her loss agro and also not land because she can‚Äôt get to you.
---
Best way to fight her is stand on open land and shoot at her. You won‚Äôt have problems when you do that.
---
For all the things wrong with this game, the map design certainly isn't one of them.
---
It disappeared after taking it out if my stash box. I tuck it out and it disappeared. It wasn't duped. It wasn't that good a handhand to be worth duping, only a explosive, +1 agility one.
---
F
---
What system you play on
---
Honestly all the atomic shop stuff is nice But.....where am I gonna put it? I can't fit crap else in my camp. Also they need to just straight up let us build anywhere outside and let us visit the capital wasteland or new Vegas or boston... I'm getting bored running around in WV.
---
&gt; There is a new vault raid that seems to be on the horizon
---
Source?
---
Or the bbq quest in the toxic valley if you bring all the optional meats and veggies.
---
Awesome. Are you past zorbo?
---
Could be me. I always try to jump on the moth man before he drops. But we all know it doesn't work and you will fall though him... But nice shot!
---
I am an unyielding unarmed build and I switch between bloodied and vampires unarmed weapons. With enough strength points, perks, and  my armored backpack, my damage resistance is almost 520, which helps me take a beating at those events. With the bloodied gauntlet I can get about 450 per swipe at the SBQ. For Encryptid, I burn through diluted stimpaks. I do use a lot of diluted rad-x or radshield and I switch to my vampire weapon in mobs.
---
That‚Äôs what I was doing lol; she just wouldn‚Äôt land and then when I either died once or went to repair my weapon is when she flew off into the nuke zone and healed herself lmfao
---
You know I never knew about this until a month ago when I saw it in a video. Man I was mad, because I took months to get that and the high capacity mod. Lol
---
they really need visual indicators like perhaps feet icons left or right of the screen to indicate heard footsteps
---
It also helps from scrapping/selling/scripping/dropping favorited items.
---
How'd you have spare lead lol?
---
I like watching Poseidon get powered up.
---
Most duped weapons don't get removed. Most dupers find if they get there account back after duping that the weapons are still there. 
---
Same has been true with the recent ban wave
---
Are you using "Leave World" to end your session? There is anecdotal evidence that you may remain in the world for a while if you just Quit or kill the application, which would run the timer down, increase thirst/hunger, increase spoiling, etc. Might help with investigation.
---
Blueprints my friend, if you have any sort of primary connection intended with the through wall conduit what I usually do is create those first connected base pieces elsewhere easy flat ground not connected to anything, then blueprint it.
---
Then you can store and bring that whole blueprint to the area you want to install it and find where it works. If you're underground or bottom floor and know you want to go up or out with it, connect those pipes too before blueprinting as well. 
---
This has definitely taken a lot of the real struggle out of it for me getting it initially working.
---
&gt;Not sure but I've heard roaming bands of miscreants  keep breaking it to steal coat hangers, lamps, and to just beat down the guards
---
hey, there is hardly a better bathroom in all of westvirginia than in the hornwright estate.
---
I won't let the sauna be taken away after a hard day in the wasteland
---
I think it's fixed? I still have to wait a couple of seconds until the map loads in all the fast travel spots when I'm overcumbered.
---
if you're on PC, the BE+agi handmade is one of the most duped weapons in history. I know it's probably not the case, just reminiscing I guess.
---
I can almost guarantee you it's the server. was it particularly laggy? was there a nuke or a queen fight going on? did it happen during the weekend?
---
the way the game works, whenever you move something, anything, it's literally removed from your person for a split second. it stops existing. then the game is told to recreate that item at the target destination. except, Fo76 being online and the netcode being \*, sometimes the server loses the packet telling to put it back and then... poof.
---
They spent all their time the early game
---
Sell your bulk for anywhere over 100 caps
---
They have a lovely bathroom, so nice of them to leave keycards everywhere for this affected by their automation policies
---
I'm pretty OCD when it comes to perfect symmetry in my camp. And I hate visible wires. Place your conduits on the floor before you place the walls. I actually ran all the conduits on the top edge of my walls before placing the roof down. Running conduit *after* is the problem.
---
Also, due to my need for symmetry, i find it easier to run my conduit in a particular way - run it roughly to get the lengths and spacing of junctions right, then **blueprint** it and place the entire run or portion more precisely. Kind of more similar to bending and brazing copper piping, I suppose?
---
Last piece of advice I have is that the 'Replace' option for walls, roofs, and floors is your friend here. So it possibly running a wetwall/service corridor kind of structure.
---
If you're on PS4 you're free to come and check out my camp and ask any questions üëç
---
It is frustrating, but it is *problem solving* and I love how therapeutic it can be. I often spend hours upon hour getting lost in a rebuild. I just really wish that conduits took up zero budget, just like wires! Most of the fun is learning new things completely out of necessity. Just for fun, apart from the "flamethrower trick" I've made an effort to learn everything on my own or by visiting other camps and getting ideas.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Huh. Great pic
---
Thanks! I just got lucky!
---
They only two things that truly bug me are 1) the insane lag that happens sometimes and 2) the rubberbanding health. I think action girl might be bugged atm which is why I'm noticing it more then usual.
---
Before public teams I'd get random invites to teams. Very rarely I'd refuse and, despite scary stories here of being tricked into blah blah, I never had issues.
---
But yeah several times I (quite a high level) had an invite, would accept, and the low level inviter would do the "come here" emote loads. I'd head over and every time they'd be in a high level area trapped in a house / behind a building hiding from something big. Like a level 20 that was fighting a 3* level 50 sheepsquatch. Helped them out, dropped some meds and went on my way.
---
I mean the high school is solid for plastic farming.
---
Removes radiation in encryptid. For areas with radiation, Ghoulish is useful. Still, you will have to use diluted radaways from time to time.
---
Huh. Hey btw this may be relevant but someone else discovered the bugged atoms also went to your bethesda launcher. This bug only happens if you're using steam. Not clear if they'll get moved over.
---
Well there you go what a clever idea
---
That isn't accurate.
---
That is promotional purposes, not actual players. It is also not global. I believe it is tied to your specific region.
---
Xbox puts NBA 2K20 as third most played, when it is actually 3rd.
---
ESO is in the top 20, but it isn't even in the top 50 in real terms.
---
Here are the actual stats:
---
My friend and I were getting me through the main quest. I'm around level 35, he's somewhere in the 50s at this point. I'm running around rocking my 10mm SMG because that's the only thing I had ammo for, he's in X-01 with a super sledge.
---
I randomly stumbled across a 3 star sheepsquatch on the freeway somewhere. Keep in mind, I've killed exactly 1 scorchbeast at this point. He's never run into one yet either. I believe his exact words were "eh, this thing can't be all that hard". Cue a 25 minute battle in which the most constructive sentence either of us could muster was "oh God, oh fuck, what the actual fuck"
---
Favorite fight I've ever been in.
---
Marigold pavillion has a good random encounter also a few steps north of the IMAX station is also a good one just gotta server hop
---
Okay it‚Äôs fine I wasn‚Äôt aware I could craft a lvl 50 back pack all this time I was using a lvl 20 one
---
My fps dropping to 0 anytime i want to change weapons, look at a vendor, or go to a big event.
---
Damn ps4. But I really enjoy this moment right now that I'm not the only one trying this lol
---
I had a ‚Äònormal‚Äô heavy weapon char with tse and now have both a junkie heavy and a bloody heavy. Junkie is imho the best
---
Mininukes as quest rewards. Be honest, almost nobody uses them, they're just stupidly heavy trash. Low levels won't have access to a Fatman, midlevels are usually dealing with inventory and stash management and can't afford to carry them around, and most high levels have at this point realized Fatmans are disproportionately weak.
---
Is it weird that I found enough random T-60 pieces on frames here and there to build an entire level 50 set? I just need to keep it in good repair now...
---
Im gonna trust the official spot on the most played list on the store over something that doesn't even elaborate how it's calculated more than "we use a huge pool of 2 million xbox players"
---
Thats a sad thing. I wish they could remove all and every duped weapon. But before that, they have to find a full fix for dupeing.
---
Excavator Power Armour super duper and chemist and semi regular runs of a couple of the mine that have plenty of ore
---
So before I log out i have to come back to my camp and check if someone's at my vending machines? 
---
That's ridiculous ü§£
---
XP glitch when game first dropped
---
Awesome capture!
---
You should see my camp, two walls floating, unable to demolish.  Something out of Commander Daguerre's nightmare.
---
If this was Xbox yesterday it very well could have been me. I always jump off the top to try to catch Mothman mid air
---
To much to explain, go onto YouTube, plenty of videos on this build.
---
You will need to do the scout quests to get possum rank. (Not sure you can get possum badges before this) then you need to earn 5 possums badges.  Stings and things (repeatable) and camp fire tales (public event) give a 1 in 8 chance of a badge roughly.  The possum badges are guaranteed from the world scout challenges.  You need 5 badges to buy the 60 wt plans.  You can apply any model to it including chemist or armor (most popular choices)
---
So go buy the communist collecttron and set it to blood packs. You will get a bunch then max rank super duper and use chemist and you will get 2 times stims from chemist and then super duper gives double. Once I started doing that I never run out of stims
---
That‚Äôs the thing if your not ready to solo her. 
---
Dying and or leaving the area to repair will make her heal. Just make sure you can kill her while having enough durability and stims to solo.
---
It‚Äôs best to be on a public server if you can‚Äôt kill her within 10 minutes by your self.
---
In Huntersville you can find them in the meat bags of the super mutants
---
Sorry, PC about a month ago. Another redditor on PS4 thought it could have been him. Apparently a lot of people try to jump on him!
---
I saw a group of settlers with a settler leader outside of the wayward.
---
I asked him about it, and he said no, and i honestly believe him. The amount of times i've seen him server hop in and out of my lobbies to farm west tek makes me believe he's clean.
---
If you would like to join a party. I‚Äôd be happy to explain. Too much to say writing it out.
---
I never thought to put the door onüòÑ
---
Yeah I do that but it's never what you would call spare because ammo. The only thing I can think is melee builds but then why would you take the time to run Lucky Hole when you didn't need to?
---
Why would people be pissed off?
---
I love NW! Only if playing with friends and coms though. It sucks playing alone with randoms.
---
I could type 6 paragraphs or you could watch 1 of maybe 8 videos on YouTube. Between angryturtle and captain noob, there is something there
---
I prefer selling ammo. Looking for a player vendor that sells lead scrap is harder than finding the place to mine lead. üòÑ
---
I can‚Äôt stand this. I was getting annoyed with it last night doing the same thing. But I have experienced this at places like whitespring where doors are open but say closed and look closed. But being this is at my new camp it‚Äôs annoying
---
Big topic, for a start you'll want to choose a weapon type and if you want to go stealth or power armor.
---
Use the search function or just look up a video.
---
TrueAchievents is well-regarded by Microsoft. Microsoft shares information with them,and Microsoft even relied on them this year to provide the 'Year in Review' and actively promoted the site.
---
You can trust their information. Hell, TrueAchievements designed their own scanning tech, all with Microsofts support to look at games played.
---
I'm on my 3rd play through, I promised myself I'd pick the boring guy since he was the only one I hadn't but the mad doctor is just too much fun.
---
thanks. i didn't know about this.
---
Use a bloodied weapon, pick perks and mutations which compliment low health whilst having increased damage output, wear unyielding armour which increases your stats the lower your health
---
Me
---
I do it when ppl start buying out all the serum to resell.
---
But the pvp kinda bori
---
I‚Äôll give that a go next time! 
---
Was making a lot of progress and she would‚Äôve died much sooner but alas. Learning lesson for me for sure! Thanks for the tips/advice
---
I'm one Xbox and it happened 10 mins before I posted this. The gun wasn't bloodied or junkies. Literally just  explosive+agi. My main (the character I lost it on) is a all rounder build so bloodied and so on is just a plus.
---
There has been a SBQ fight though the fight happened before I joined. But there has been a little lag.
---
Anyway I've been meaning to find a better weapon so its not the biggest deal to me but  thought I should share to communities I often post in to let people know in case it happens to someone else.
---
Depends, I sell all ammo at a cap a piece and the raw ore at 50 each, for 5 mil and .50 its cheaper to just buy the ore and make it yourself, but the smaller types vary depending on how much you buy
---
Edit: with the right perks*
---
PS4
---
Any one else notice there is a enclave logo on the pig's butt? Least that's what it looks like.
---
Fair warning to add on to Compound Bows, it is entirely incompatible with any skins for the standard Bow. I have no idea why, and it's a shame too as the Bow has some really cools skins from the Atom Shop, Nuclear Winter, and Seasons.
---
I didn't think I'd ever complete the requirements but then was able to revive someone in a SBQ fight.  Now revived many.  Go to big events like that.  I also did the crossbow requirement.  After completing, you can earn a bunch of Possum badges at Stings and Things.
---
Me: ‚ÄúAah that‚Äôs a nice place for my bed‚Äù
---
Game: ‚ÄúGOOD LUCK SLEEPING ON THE ROOF YOU LITTLE SHIT‚Äù
---
Idk man i still take the most played list on Xbox over this considering they have the full data rather than a limited pool of 2 million players
---
Well I mainly play on Xbox but I do have a PlayStation and the game I can help out. I‚Äôm only level 5 I got it on here also because I want to see how PlayStation community is like
---
I mean that they clearly had lives going on before you walked up and if you don‚Äôt engage with them then continue living out their scrip or at least the game tries to convey that.
---
For me the bloodied is a back up since i play via charging in and shooting things in the face. I use perks for less action point cost for sprinting and it really helps for the way I play. You just need to find what ways works best for you.
---
He also runs the Red Rocket when I'm not around.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Really? The description when it is in the vending machine says you need to be near your teammates. If it works for a public team of one, or if your team is halfway across the map, that's awesome.  I'm trying to be very careful about my mutations.
---
Great job, those can take a beating.
---
Just an unfortunate FYI - chems don't stack at all.  So if you hit Psycho &amp; then Med-X you'd only get the Med-X effect.  In other words you only get the effect of the last drug you took.
---
Edit - the only exceptions to that are things that're diluted so you can stack rad-x, and diluted rad-x for a bit more resistance.
---
Homelander vs. The Mothman!
---
Nice!  I'm on PC, but it would be rad to see!
---
I encountered something different today, I couldn't press space to revive, I had to close the game and relog. Happened three times, hopefully my character isn't forever bugged. Wouldn't surprise me tbh lol
---
That's pretty clear that they can't satisfy 100% of the playerbase with their decisions. There are different views on gameplay and there are simply bad design decisions. I already pointed out the main issues of the perk coin system in my two [huge](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h84ekh/pts_rant_remove_the_perk_coin_system_entirely_for/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hnzwv8/pts_rant_episode_ii_remove_the_perk_coin_system/) I made here a while ago so I won't repeat myself.
---
It just baffles me how ignorant they are with lots of their quite strange decisions. Year after year. It seems like other companies know perfectly well how to fix their games and they do that as the time goes but Bethesda doesn't even have a distant clue on how to fix theirs.
---
I'm not sure; I mostly play solo in the game.
---
yeah the camera "speed walking" is really annoying. My guess is they bound the walking sound to some variable that they forgot to change on the camera. Remember when your walking speed was still bound to your fps shortly after launch?
---
Yes I am, and thanks! I've started a new build now so will hopefully be able to share that soon too!
---
Thanks!  I'm loving the prefabs; that is about all I spend my atoms on.
---
Or Missiles. Yeah, I know what you mean. :)
---
Hah yeah!
---
There has been exactly one x3 months ago when amount of players was getting low. 2x events happen every 2 or 3 months, but it varies. I would bet 5 caps that they will put in one 2x event every season from now on.
---
It should be considered duping yes ?
---
FFR. I wouldn't scrip the other unless you're hurting for scrip. You can get 4-5k caps for it pretty quick in your vendor.
---
I finished it. Spent ALL my atoms üòÇ
---
Thats a lot of hours!
---
Well, they kinda did but the implementation of the changes they made after listening to the community leaves to wish for much more complex/better solutions.
---
If anybody at that event seriously thinks there are no events...just look at the top right when at the site, read the loading screen text or even just listen to what the voice is telling you to do!
---
aw nice! id love to have a dog companion in the wasteland
---
Yeah, I also remember that you could run faster by just looking at the ground while running. Not sure if that was a fever dream or an actual thing, though, there have been so much odd things going on 'back in those days' that separating facts from fiction is a bit of a blurry task these days. :)
---
That should be easy have a friend transfer your character a good amount of caps , canned food and water and just save for a double exp weekend
---
For sure keep the FFR.
---
Without dying?! Dude that's impressive
---
I had vendors for two days then got rid of them again today, I don't have the room. They also take up too much time 
---
I'll give it away if someone wants it. I'm on PC
---
2 million players is more than enough to extrapolate from.
---
I can go with all of the bugs,but the vats one.... it drives me insane.....
---
Ive picked up a crap ton of. 308 and I've been loving the MG so much. It is a blast, itd be nice if they gave it mods
---
When I see a locked camp I just photomode inside and give them a scare when they come back
---
Great pic! I really like the raider tree, gives me something to work towards. Level 40 atm. üëçüèº
---
I think the 'looking at ground' increased your fps a bit and if you unlocked fps it made you walk faster
---
But honestly PA with heavy guns most suited for queen, due to perks and dps
---
You'd probably have more fun in a public server.
---
thx
---
You can tame it with the animal friend perk! Try to keep it indoors, but idk how bethesda spawns it it
---
Always!
---
Yeah I started doing this and was like "why does this make a difference, ah screw it at least it works".
---
Msg me on PSN XxQuarantinaxX
---
Can't seem to attach images here
---
This is how some of the best death towers were started!
---
Personnally when i saw some lvl 600ish player when first started the only thing i was thinking was:  
---
"What. IS THAT EVEN USEFULL TO GET THAT HIGH LEVEL WISE ?????"
---
It's very much not considering xbox live apparently has 65 million users as of 2020.
---
This is the way to go. 
---
The shovel makes such a lovely sound when you hit something it never gets old.
---
boink boink boink boink
---
Im on xbox sorry
---
It was 76% positive for a while and that was brilliantly poetic
---
I used to be an adventurer too, until.....
---
Selecting the same location on the map 3-6 times before you actually fast travel there, the immense lag from having a lot in your inventory and stash (not even a lot. Just a standard amount) and the unusable trade interface
---
Not true, low levels run with full health, so its not an issue. I got a SBQ loot drop as lvl 22 with auto laser shotgun (did over 1k)
---
He's just trying to provide for his familyü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh no doubt. But like I said I gotta get that routine done in a limited amount of play time. If I could ignore needing to get that daily score and gold I could spend more time doing public server stuff. Weekends I get a bit more time to play and I have jumped on public and it is a blast. The collection grind is killing me though.
---
If i had a dollar for ever time this happened.. sometimes it feels like people do that on purpose.
---
1. Get bloodied weapon.
---
2. Get unyielding armor set.
---
3. Get *Adrenal Reaction* mutation.
---
4. Use (for cookie cutter build) *Str*\-*Blocker, End-Radicool, End-Fireproof, Int-Nerd Rage! (most important/must have), Lck-Serendipity* and your weapon of choice perks.
---
5. Get yourself radiated until you trigger *Nerd Rage!* perk (just under 20% health)
---
6. Go pew pew and laugh at your enemies as they fall before you.
---
Why, when I fast travel somewhere, does the death noise for a creature play and everything drops dead?
---
Why do they never attempt to explain mole miners?
---
Why are there so many cargobots swarming outside point pleasant?
---
Why do sb corpses follow me everywhere?
---
I don‚Äôt ever initiate PVP anymore (did it once bc they were attacking my camp, killed both low levels but couldn‚Äôt kill the high level that showed up afterwards) but if someone hits me while I‚Äôm shopping at a vendor I‚Äôll start some laundry maybe get a snack, just to waste time.
---
Right? The moments where you get to use it to its full potential is such a joy. Still sucks you can only do it for like 2-3 mins other wise your ammo disappears.
---
I used to sell bulk lead as I was a junkies rifleman and just picked up lead items as I travelled around. I also have a lead resource extractor. Then I got a bloodied, ffr, rw assault rifle. I now pay rent at the lucky hole mine!!
---
Aronholt homestead. Near the corn plants or the grain silo. Sometimes they also appear inside the Dolly Sods wilderness.
---
It is if the sample is selected properly.
---
It is the same reason polls can be within a couple of % accuracy when you only poll a few thousand people but apply to millions.
---
It all comes down to sample selection. Basic statistics.
---
And it's vats cost is so damn expensive, tryin to sneak in a few small bursts here n there and itll be drained after two kills.
---
I think this is part of the confusion where many are giving them more credit and they assume it's intentionally done. 
---
I personally believe that Bethesda knows what many issues are but I genuinely don't think they know how to fix most of it, their most recent comments about fixes kinda underscores this and reframes the understanding a bit. 
---
Like, it's one thing for us to all say, okay so some portion of players are getting an auto-complete, but then they have to figure out the circumstances that cause it, what claims are accurate vs inaccurate, what can be repeatedly found error then to trace that error to a cause and then to try to fix that cause. 
---
Ive done a lot of modding on Bethesda games for the last decade and I gotta tell ya, as someone both using mods and creating them, the system is absolutely nonsensical at times and you can change two completely absolutely unconnected things that should absolutely never have any reason for having the end result it does of some random failure.... But it does. 
---
This of course brings the conversation back to the underlining issue being the actual game engine and how scripts work, but that's definitely not likely to change. I don't see them doing an ESO style complete reworking of the engine and instead they're going to just do the best they can with what they have and we're going to keep finding out these crazy bugs because now on top of endless attach scripts that could have a failure in any one and create cascading issues, we add serverside issues which only compound the problem.
---
I never thought about that.. I mean, dm‚Äôing on ps4 is unwieldy, but at least its there. In game chat would really be a game changer.
---
Awesome! Thank you. 
---
I personally wish we could do something like with the pet frog thing just a little less comedically cruel, though if that was an option I'd likely put a cat in nearly every room.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm on PS4, DoctorJaxx.
---
I shall try that. Thanks!
---
I would love to test that... Just for shits and giggles. Unfortunately I‚Äôm banned.
---
Having to swap out perk cards. Can't wait for perk load outs.
---
No, I ate the food and immediately quit. Datamined all foods, these are the only ones with a flag that dispels the effect upon leaving the world.
---
Same. I'm 1.1k or so hours in. I log in for the dailys. Then just kinda fuck around for a bit. Don't do a whole lot, maybe an event if it pops up. I mainly hang out in my camp, maybe check a few vendors. At level 350 now I don't need a whole lot haha
---
Forgot that you could even lock workbenches.
---
Always make a workshop when I build camps for all to use.
---
Only lock 1 water purifier so I am guaranteed some water.  The rest can be taken.
---
That would be good. Though I think 76 is past the point that removing all duped weapons would be fair. Its been such a big issue for so long that most people likely brought one at some point. 
---
If you brought or was given a two shot explosive, bloodied or Junkies weapon or a weapon that has a magic legendary effect, there is a fair chance it was duped. Only way to know is if it's not is to get it of a legendary kill, event reward or buying from the purveyor.
---
Looks like a dragonballesque fight scene
---
Also for archery, killing things by bashing them with a crossbow counts as a crossbow kill.  It also makes the condition of the bow degrade quickly which you want because you need to repair it 3 times.  If you don't know the crossbow plan already, the plan should spawn at the archery range at the scout camp and you'll need to go there anyways.
---
If it isn't there try changing servers, someone else picked it up.
---
Gamma guns are literally designed to give rads. But only within PvP/PvE.
---
The other side of that coin is a player like me with unyielding SS armor so I'm well above the DR and ER threshold for diminishing returns, meaning I can stand to lose the miniscule amount of both and still be fine. 
---
On top of that I have 120 total carry weight from my back pack that is useful for anything in general as opposed to just chem weight reductions. It is highly unnecessary to carry around a surplus of chems, if you have more than 25-30 stimpaks/radaway that's a lot. Most other chems are completely useless as I don't need a damage or ap buff thanks to my bloodied/unyielding build. 
---
The chemist and grocer mods are both useless in the eyes of a player with a build like mine. I rock 500 carry weight and less than 50 lbs belongs to the aid section, without any weight reduction perks.
---
What?! You don't like that super tasty and premium piece of mirelurk meat after fighting those crying deep sea fish? lol
---
Bloodied Weapons and Unyielding (and Bolstering) Armor have modifiers that increase bonuses the lower your health. 20% Health or lower is the best. 
---
With Bolstering Armor you get +35 DR for each piece of armor. With Unyielding Armor you get +2 (is it +3?) to all SPECIAL Stats but Endurance. This means at low health, Bolstering can jack up your DR (but it's not worth it since there's diminishing returns). Unyielding jacks up your SPECIAL and you get all the benefits that go with it like Strength's carry weight and melee damage; Agility's AP and Sneak abilities, etc.
---
Pick the weapon type of your choice, get a Bloodied Legendary of that type.
---
For Perks, get whatever compliments your weapon type (Commando for automatics, Rifleman for rifles, etc). You'll also want Nerd Rage and Serendipity. Those two are a MUST. You'll also likely want to run Mutations, so get Class Freak and Starched Genes. Bloody Mess will jack your Damage further. Since you're running low health you'll want to stay hidden so get Sneak and Escape Artist. Also, since you're staying hidden you'll want Covert Operative or Ninja to get a higher Sneak multiplier. Since you'll be using Radiation to keep your health at 20% or lower, Radicool will give you even more Strength SPECIAL for even more Carry Weight and Melee Damage.
---
Basically, certain weapons and armor give bonuses for low health, massive bonuses. So you run the risk of one-hit deaths for the ability of one-hit kills. You use Perks and Legendary modifiers to help mitigate the risk of dying and to help make your attacks kill anything in one shot because if it stays alive it has a chance to attack, if it attacks you have a chance of dying. Risk vs Reward.
---
Last time I saw fixer plans I was about 3000 caps short!  Reasonably priced? Id just take available
---
Me.. I always do it and I wait until scorch earth event start before travelling there.
---
I managed to trade for a B3325 one. it works, if you have a crapton of AP and get lucky with grim reaper's sprint.
---
I only did the event a couple times. Never got it the first 3 times and then I finally found someone to sell it for 5k caps I took the deal. Very next event I get the fixer drop.
---
...to the point where ZAX actually comments ‚Äúthe match has already begun‚Äù. It took me ages to realise that this was basically saying, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve loaded in slower and everyone else already has a gun‚Äù.
---
Which is why I roll with one specifically for Mothman event.  Hello frog "BONK"!
---
Diluted RadX doesn't take mutations?
---
Yeah im having a rough time believing that a sample size that's barely even a fraction of the userbase represents the most played games better than what likely represents the entire playerbase.
---
I can not step on a tiny peble, I have to jump it over...
---
Some weapons autoloads, at 30% of clip capacity. My inventory is full with plasma cores with 20-30% charge. They most likely never will be used again :)
---
I have an electrified sheepsquatch staff. The blue light orb shows up even I holster it...
---
nope.
---
The chemist and grocer mods work on the small backpack
---
Because they can‚Äôt use their special armor and legacies in NW, and imo, they are more than entitled to use their super duper explosive laser rifles and ass/sent armor. They worked for it, unless they‚Äôre dupers. In which case, they‚Äôre just assholes.
---
Very true. An understandable reason to leave in a hurry.
---
Nice shot, hope they had Goat Legs enabled or their enlightenment could be short-lived lol.
---
it seems that (nuclear) winter will soon come when the bears go to a shelter
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúpopped as soon as I went to the plant to claim it.‚Äù
---
Few weeks ago I had a look and it was around 30th on steam for most concurrent players at that moment. Sounds fine (not high or low) but a ton of players went back to the Beth launcher for the PTS servers, legendary perks, etc. So that's not even everybody.
---
'Dead game' shit talkers have no idea.
---
Fallout 4 was actually high up the list too.
---
Edit: typo
---
Only animal friend is used for Taming.
---
Unfortunately there will never be a full fix for duping on this game. This is basically a 20 year old game engine that modders and hackers have come to know inside out. With Bethesda‚Äôs track record of breaking two things for everything they fix, exploits and hacking will always be a problem.
---
Last night I ran into a level 2000 player and was like damnn... impressive
---
Addiction is the only reason people get past level 50.
---
You are hearing all wrong my good friend I'm actually willing to do that cause i already have some of the things for it it's just hard to get it thus is why I put this out. If need be I can and will go and get the thing.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f675c8&amp;d=pn2pt2pu2pv2el2c72cg2ic4ar2an2l71lt2lu2e82a51s01pj2a12ao0sg0&amp;m=51c2483&amp;n=Bosmer
---
My build went heavy on sneak. Overtime I added in for berserkers. So no armour. Not even broken. Kept cannibal. Because why not have a free meal? A real go for broke style. Its got decent damage against the queen and everything else. Mixed in a little throwing weapons for further stealth options.
---
Yeah, I know that. It is sad :(
---
these are all top of my list for sure.
---
Ouch. Thats the worst. I try to stay far from the cap limit for that exact reason. Ive only had that happen to me once or twice. Of course that also means there are plenty of times I dont have the caps to buy something I really want.
---
8 possum badges, not 5 :(
---
Get a friend to be a middleman. Only way that is 100% safe (if you trust your friend).
---
Have a friend who can help with a private server or even better with an empty char who can hold everything while you switch accounts
---
You could always ask someone to use their private server.  Is there anyone on your friends list who has 1st you can ask?  If not I bet there is a kind soul or two on here that might be willing to help you out.  I would if I was on your platform.
---
best i can think to suggest is to borrow a friend's ps4 and log into one of your accounts on it, then do a direct trade/dropoff.
---
If you want to I don't want to force it upon you.
---
FF, make sure you use the Accelerated Barrel.
---
Magic Weapon, extremely valuable
---
That's going to help a lot
---
Not the ONLY reason. Some of us enjoy the game.
---
thx :)
---
(X) Doubt
---
Yeah...
---
"Oh, thank you for did my quest. Here, 20 lbs shit into your inventory. I am free, now it is your burden."
---
i was sure they all need the regular one. thanks for clearing this up. another TIL :D
---
Yeah you definitely want to look at your addiction, it's not healthy. I hate the fact Bethesda has now caused people to play more making things worse. I think yours is next level addiction and will catch up to you.
---
I refuse to play like that, so I probably have a mild addiction compared to you, I just burn time on the game but I expect to stop playing at some point due to the way the game has gone with score, but I still enjoy jumping on for now. I don't have the need to do every quest.
---
Try switch games up and do something else ..
---
Are you using an explosive shotgun? Their AoE hurts you too, you know. Get a Dense mod on your chest armor, or the Fireproof perk.
---
Is the shotgun explosive?
---
Is your gun explosive?
---
is it an explosive legendary? or maybe a gauss shotgun?
---
Wait i think i saw you ones
---
unfortunatly the bloodied explosive 15% vats fill rate blackpowder gun was only lvl 15
---
FFS. Well, the more you know
---
That triple XP was insane.  I leveled up 5 times in just 8 minutes during one run through Westek.
---
As another poster said, it was a desperation move by Bethesda and it actually worked out.  I think it was to make up for wastelanders being delayed.
---
did you use stagger perks at that time? hit too much in the head with vats? that too make her not to land
---
I‚Äôve found highest level players to be nice and compassionate. Give em a wave, buy a plan from their vendor and all is well. 
---
Players at, or near your level (60 for me) will almost always start blasting away at you. Which I don‚Äôt mind. A good fair fight is never a bad thing.
---
Regular doors sometimes do this to me at my camp as well. 
---
I think it might be the shady shack door too.
---
We have a private server option on both accounts but it recognizes it as two different people I think.
---
Sure there are tons of bugs in that old engine and it didn't age well unfortunately. You pretty much summed it all up perfectly and I got nothing to add here.
---
By the way, it would be great to take a look at your mods since I'm a modder myself and I like to discover what others came up with -))
---
Great work around I tried it and it does work pretty damn good.
---
Cool let me know when you‚Äôre next online on PS4 thanks
---
nah you know what's real funny?  playing the game and watching sales come up.  and then more sales, and then max caps, and then more sales and not gains.  there shouldn't be a cap limit to be honest.  I've had multiple rare(r) asylum dresses sell over the last week for no caps gained for me because they put me over max with buying ammo or something before that.   both yellow and forest sold for free essentially :(
---
needless to say the wire to my vendor was scrapped this morning.
---
A level 400+ is like a space marine from 40k  im currently almost 200 and im like ok a demi god just dropped in the event.
---
I‚Äôve got everything done now except the reviving
---
Funnily enough usually short on steel lol
---
Perfect!
---
Here‚Äôs my Big Iron build. Uses exclusively.44 ammo revolvers. Recent went junkies. Decent vats and carries tons of booze. Not the most OP build but fun is the theme. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=63395ff&amp;d=ad2ap2ak2al2a32lr2le2lt2lk2lv2ic4c72c41c81e20p02s01sv3&amp;n=Big%20Iron
---
I'm my particular case, they just disappear when I take one and the event to defend It begins. When I finish the event they're visible again
---
This is not what I'm saying to do, and this is not what I did either. 
---
I calmly let him know that the robot was taking no damage. Because it SHOULDNT. And if it is still taking damage while invisible then it shouldnt say in the instructions that's it's completely invincible while invisible. 
---
I was not able to take a pylon. The level 300 couldnt take a pylon and aggro. The level 200 made no move to go for one. I wasnt angry, and I did not yell at anyone.
---
Haha, that might have been me!  The Mothman appeared but was stuck in the air in that spot so I climbed the tower and jumped off, hitting the "A" button as I touched him, collecting my XP bonus.
---
But It breaks emerson, I just wasn't sure what to tag it as so I just put bug
---
You forgot -- 7. Spend the rest of your time on Reddit explaining why Bloodied is more powerful than &lt;enter build type&gt;. :)
---
Perfect list BTW.
---
You have to finish the Van Lowe Taxidermy quest line for the plan to be able to drop, so that might be why you arent getting any luck with the plan dropping
---
Lol, you dont get that many levels under your belt pvping for no rewards and most players who really love to pvp eventually find another game that has more to offer pvpers.  Not that there aren't exceptions of course.
---
If you are bloodied mele you must love the poison
---
I always check out things like this when i visit other camps ;)  but i'm on xbone.
---
this idea of building it somewhere else, blue printing it and bringing  it into place seems like a good idea.  modular building seems to be pretty popular the more i look at building tips for this game.  wish they'd make the build engine a little less....yea...
---
i'll have to try that next time i'm on.  i don't mind the problem solving but some things just don't make sense.  IRL, you don't build the electrical system then the house around it .
---
The Brotherhood becomes closeminded over the centuries. Right now they're just x-military looking for a future. I'd say that those in Appalachia is probably disgusted by what has been done at West-tec and easily convinced to join by the Wets Coast chapter as they've seen the same thing as Maxson saw, but I wouldn't put the later Brotherhood isolationist views on this chapter.
---
There is a perk you can get which prevents all limb damage. Try that. Mandatory if using explosive shotguns.
---
I dont have a vampire's weapon. I dont keep legendaries I dont need/use unless I'm trying to sell/trade them, and vampires isnt something I keep on hand regularly. 
---
Good advice for anyone who does have vampires weapons though
---
That's true for a lot of games though, most 'new' engines are upgraded old ones. Bethesda needs to update there engine a lot more in my opinion. 
---
Though given they are open to modding most of there games. We'd most likely still see duping.
---
I rotate the setting each day once it fills up and stops collecting. I find that to be the most effective use. Especially if your camp doesn‚Äôt have a resource node to farm.
---
Yeah, fallout PVP just doesn‚Äôt really do it for me. Too clunky. Fun at times, but I‚Äôll stick to apex to get my pvp fill. 
---
C.A.M.P building on the other hand, man I could do that for days. It‚Äôs like buying a home, but FREE!
---
But wait! Act now and we'll break the entire functionality of your C.A.M.P. with a single paint job!
---
Any animal I think can be tamed if you get it in a random encounter. They'll be some that can't be tamed
---
The Fireproof perk prevents damage, but your limbs can still be crippled from your own shots. The Adamantium Skeleton perk reduces limb damage, and eliminates it at max rank.
---
Yep, just looked it up: Adamantium Skeleton. Thanks for the tip!
---
rubber banding health, not hitting in vats at point blank range with a 95% hit chance and a shot gun wtf!
---
My carry weight with the high capacity on is 520 but I'm okay with only having 460 most of the time.  Extra capacity is there if I need it though.
---
A basic Eli5 is that you want to keep your HP at or slightly below 20% to take advantage of the insanity of low life perk/legendarymod/mutation synergies.
---
1. You get the maximum offensive and defensive benefits of Nerd Rage. (and a flat 15% bonus to AP regen that doesnt scale with card level.)
---
2. You draw the benefits of Serendipity's huge dmg mitigation for being below 30% HP (45% chance to take zero dmg from **all** sources - even explosions and fall dmg.)
---
3. You get a flat 18% chance to avoid projectile damage from Ricochet (It procs a ton.)
---
4. You get a huge dmg bonus from the Adrenal Reaction mutation.
---
5. You get another huge dmg bonus from using the signature Bloodied weapon (its dmg increases as your Hp drops. Dmg caps at 20% Hp.
---
6. And best and most game breaking of all: the Unyielding legendary armor mod. The benefits of which are quite incredible. At 20% HP, every slot with the Unyielding mod grants +3 to all Specials except endurance. This is more significant than one might think. Instead think of it like this; While you are at or below 20% HP, *every piece* of unyielding armor gives you...
---
* \+15 carry weight and increased melee dmg (+3str)
---
* increased vats accuracy (+3 per)
---
* better buy/sell prices at vendors (+3 cha)
---
* a 6% increase in experience earned from all sources and improved returns from scrapping (+3int)
---
* more AP and improved stealth (+3 agi)
---
* And finally increased durability on all found items and faster crit bar fill chance (+3 luc)
---
And to top it all off, the huge stat bonuses open up every available conversation option resulting from stat bonuses. These can provide some very useful shortcuts during questing.
---
Of course, the great downside of any low life build is Rad management. But that is a fairly minor trade off for what is undeniably the strongest build for every weapon type in the game.
---
You just need Animal Friend.
---
The hard part is finding a cat at a pet spawn. I have had probably around 200 pets, and I have only ever seen one cat.
---
Keeping them alive has been easier recently. Find out what direction your enemies come from and put it on the opposite side. Of the camp. It will stay near the camp box. Don't put it near objects it can get stuck on, or it may pop onto the air, fall, and die. üôÅ
---
I have had some issues with putting the camp box inside. Sometimes they will spawn under the foundations. This will help keep them alive, but they are hard to find. And sometimes they pop outside.
---
Look for a map of pet spawns, the cat I found was on the green at the whitespring golf course. I would recommend low level areas like the forest.
---
When you tame it, don't follow it home. It's more likely to die that way. Just fast travel away, and check your camp in 20 minutes or so. If there are a lot of people at your camp maybe wait at your camp. 
---
Pasifying is not taming. That's all I can think of. Have fun. üòä
---
Sure. A bunch of the more recent stuff is likely still up at Beth  and nexus under my first name, Jacean. Currently I think just some of my stuff for Skyrim and fo4. 
---
Probably can find some of my older fo3 or NV stuff on nexus or some of the mod packs. 
---
I did a lot of environmental stuff, adding locations, NPCs, interactions, stuff like that.
---
Our biggest project ended up in a brick wall because if these types of script issues, and even with trying to collaborate with all of the biggest people in the modding scene from skk to kinggath, it became inevitable that the game couldn't do what was needed.  (Essentially we made the entire Commonwealth a functional workshop) instead it split into the mobile workshops and tons of new oversized and smaller settlements and settlement reworks but never what it was meant. 
---
Essentially workshops and NPCs are really fragile once created in game and easy to break. Even with brand new loads, many things can happen to prevent them from getting fully cooked so to speak.
---
IRL I don't have to light a cabinet on fire to mount a sink to it, either üòÖ
---
It shouldn't. It says in the instructions that it is invincible while invisible, which should mean completely invincible. 
---
But that's not the point Im trying to make, the point I. trying to make is that if you dont have enough people to take pylons or enough people to constantly shoot it (and do enough damage to get its health down while its invisible, if that does actually happen), just dont waste the ammo shooting him. Ammo is expensive to craft, and can get pricey to constantly buy. Just trying to save someone the caps and materials.
---
I downloaded this game because it was on Gamepass.   And when it leaves Gamepass I will buy it.
---
The apocalypse rejects your attempt at creativity...  Or at least that sneaky poster does.
---
&gt;the proper gay ass rp that folk do 
---
I don‚Äôt know about you man, but there‚Äôs only one type of roleplay I can even think of when it comes to RPG games
---
I‚Äôm eastern us what‚Äôs your time zone
---
Wonder it works with the gause shotgun as well? I'll give it a try when I get home!
---
I carry a spare set of pretty decent Troubleshooter armor with. You can often find it at scrip prices, even with Sentinel or AP refresh. It‚Äôs all ultralight, but with dense torso, and probably weighs 25 pounds.
---
I put it on for Encryptid, silos, AWOL, and Dyer Chemical. I also carry a Vampire gauntlet which I use for Encryptid.
---
Unfortunately after running around after the event none of us could find the body, and I do know it sometimes ends up in a different spot then where everyone thought it died at, but it was no big deal because I got a decent amount of loot from the other enemies. One legendary is nothing to stress over
---
The auto nuke is test server only, so that people can test the quest
---
The thing I hate the most is menu delay. I can fully mod all my weapons in 4 in about 30s, but in 76, it takes me a week.
---
It does. You‚Äôll either need another PS4 so you can direct transfer the items or another person with 1st to just sit idle in their private while you exchange items.
---
You can join me on a private server  and do your swaps if you want
---
I dont usually keep vampires weapons on hand. And if it isnt one that uses .45 or 5.56 then I definitely dont keep it.
---
There is a limit to how many you can pick up at once I believe. Try picking up 200 then the rest, it‚Äôs not an issue of weight.
---
If you had those dealings with the radroach in the bowler, I'm sad to say he has left us and passed on. He was found south of the Nuka Cola plant, in his house, sitting on the toilette. He left his wife.
---
"Take meeeee, lord!"
---
I avoided NW simply because I have no interest in PVP. I am glad the mode exists for those who do. 
---
I am rank 54 on the legendary run without NW so I'm not worried about it.
---
I'm the same as you.. just barley enuff time to get my stuff done and break down junk.
---
Yea.  Good point.
---
I‚Äôll have to come up with an alternative to the backpack method though. Raider backpack mod for my junkie
---
Odd.  Happened once yesterday for me too.  It got stuck so I just YOLO‚Äôd to get it to come down.
---
Stagger? I use tormenter? And I do hit her in the head a lot Bc that‚Äôs the most dmg output. But when she was flying, I was mainly hitting her torso (rarely got headshots unless she landed).
---
GMT 14:00
---
 ‚Üë u/Valseek what about this? ‚Üë
---
Just hanging around the campfire and sing our campfire song
---
It melts. Especially bloodied builds.
---
You can‚Äôt. It won‚Äôt let you split them in half. It won‚Äôt even bring up the counter to let u try to pick a number. It‚Äôs been broken for days for me. I haven‚Äôt been able to pick any up. My friend couldn‚Äôt pick them up either. It‚Äôs a bug not a carry weight issue.
---
I usually just eat the 40 caps, put my CAMP down again in almost the same spot.  Everything is temp blueprinted and stored.  When something like that happens I hate it, but I (can be) such a perfectionist with stuff like building.
---
Hella annoying, but it's something.
---
I thought that we can only get the t-65 via gold bullions.
---
Does the scorch queens also drops it ?
---
This is one of many cool things that could have been implemented had this game not been rushed out the door.
---
Shit man that sounds like a shit trip ... Maybe try to reinstall it on your computer?
---
I don't think you're lazy, it's a great strategy for a lower level but I have so many caps I'm literally dumping them on the ground.
---
To each their own, but saving the extra load screen by not camp hopping is worth the 30 or 40 caps to travel direct.
---
This is good advice, but not for me. I've said it a couple times under other comments but I dont keep vampires weapons, and I have no intention on starting to keep one either. I dont use vampires with the build I'm going to run, and stash space is precious to me.
---
Yeah, it's an item limit.
---
I don't even know how many I have at the moment, but it says I can't pick up anymore.
---
I need to drop all of them.
---
And if you want to run Power Armor: Drop Serendipity, it doesnt proc with PA. Legendary Armor effect dont proc in PA, so get the Emergany Protocols mod for your PA Torso, when your below 20% health you gain 25% movement speed and take 50% less damage. Nerd Rage is always a good choice too, when below 20% health gain 40 DR, 20% Damage, and 15%AP Regen.
---
This bug effects all weapons btw.
---
I can see it been frustrating but this is server hop 76. A lot of times, I am server hopping for something and someone shows up at my camp, this happens a lot, I don't have time to wait unfortunately. Sometimes I will wait, but who knows what they doing, crafting, fixing armor etc, I got things to do especially if I am hopping. Sometimes I will try wait a while.
---
Sometimes I will go back to my camp and see what they doing and at times found they just standing there afk. Not all the time but it happens .. but as someone says life happens. But a warning might be nice.
---
Got any spare Addictol?
---
All hail the holy mothman
---
It won‚Äôt even let you take half tho. Even when I have zero in my inventory it won‚Äôt even let me pick up one.
---
Also maybe make a new character and see if it happens on that one as well
---
Adamantium skeleton is what u need. Fireproof/Dense Torso mod doesnt prevent ur limbs get crippled.
---
So they‚Äôre glitched out. We even made new characters with nothing on them and tried to take one. Nothing worked
---
Possibly, and i hope this would work with shotguns too!
---
lol nice. I have a bunk bed at my camp but the sheepsquatch plushie gets the top bunk, my ally can sleep on the  floor.
---
And really nice town camp, looks really good.
---
I dont see a ton of people on console using that kind of build, if I ever see any at all. So theres little to no chance that would probably happen, but sounds kind of fun
---
Who the hell are you to judge?
---
Seeing it was a double XP weekend, me and a friend started new characters, did Free Range once around level 30-40, a high-level silent player joined and AFKd every wave of enemies that popped to kill the brahmin, got all the way to the end and I saw the green glow of the sheep for a second as it spawned and then a blast of a gauss shotgun as the high-level AFKer just one-shotted it.
---
Like what the hell? Not only was there 3 people in the event and he's the only one that got to hit it, he didn't even do anything to progress the event up to that point. Should have just let that pack of wolves kill the brahmin instead of wasting all the ammo and stims.
---
Ah okay so its a good work around for all weapons then. Thanks!
---
A Quad with the repeater signal is what you really really want.
---
I doubt it‚Äôs the only reason but could be a valid reason for some. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs many out there that could give a crap about cosmetics and score and such and spend more time having fun.
---
I think even with the prime barrel the fire rate should still be over 200 which is barely enough to trigger the magical effect. Still it's what I would do since I have more ultracite ammo than regular.
---
Alas they patched some of my building tricks so that building can't be replaced...
---
Reminds me of the end of Reign of Fire...
---
This has been happening to me sporadically but just for the last week.  Luckily at the SBQ fight it eventually allowed me to fast travel respawn at my camp and I was able to fast travel back before the event ended.  Most times it means I have to server hop.
---
Pffffft.. the stat about life expectancy of 5 minutes is FAR underestimated.  More like 12-15 minutes.
---
Vats already drains fusion cores but I swear the lmg is worse than other weapons.  Using it in vats with power armor drains your cores faster than the health bar of what you are shooting at.
---
Yeah for sure. :) I actually run dailies for 4 separate characters, I can't help myself, I have to try stop but so far haven't been able to.
---
‚ÄòSupport‚Äô an ironically named department üòÇ
---
Hope you get it sorted tho üëçüèº
---
Works with the gauss. I'm too lazy to do it though. I just miss and then kill them with the 2nd.
---
That just...  That's no fun!  Sympathy from me on that!
---
Sounds like a new science project... a cat jar!
---
Maybe they can fit dogs too in a jar...
---
what is the magical effect?
---
Use the floor mat + conduit trick, you can wire through any wall or distance. I generally use this to save on budget and if you are smart about it or confine it to rooftops or use closed off walls to hide it looks extremely clean.
---
Your name is familiar.  PC?  Was the player wearing Ghillie suit SS armor with a stealth suit helmet, Gauss shotgun/Blood Eagle suppressed handmade?
---
Was trying to prove via recents in social menu, but I‚Äôve been on about a dozen or so servers since then hopping.  I was shopping serums üôÉüòé
---
Man, don't give up. I never launch them and feel so grateful when people like you do. If you're on Xbox I can give you some cards for free
---
Yes PC! This was about a month ago, so probably wouldn't be on the recent list.
---
Just repeatedly murder everything at Isolated Radio Array, West Tek, Huntersville and Abandoned Bog Town and scrap all their guns with scrapper equipped. You get loads after a few runs.
---
It's pretty ugly indeed
---
The sooner y‚Äôall realize they‚Äôre garbage that just wants your money and stop playing in protest, the sooner they‚Äôll get to fixing.
---
I understand, it's still an explanation why someone shoots at him while he's invulnerable
---
Why can‚Äôt we plant all food type plants as crops (cranberries for example)?
---
It's when heavy guns with very fast rate of fire and certain legendary effects (in your case Junkie's) are doing way more damage than intended. Meaning you will be shredding enemies left and right.
---
Oh.  Not me then.  I‚Äôm asking about yesterday.  I may have run into you yesterday and I did unstuck the Mothman yesterday YOLOing it, but that was my first time.  When i saw the stringy pixels of what looks like the ghillie skin I thought it might have been me ü§£üòÇ.
---
Edit:  Derp.  That‚Äôs a hand and outline of a Pipboy.  Lol
---
That is awesome! Thanks for the info, I'll take a look at your works -)) I think I might've been using your mods in the past since I usually play fallout and es games heavily modded.
---
Behind Whitesprings Station above blackwater mine is a billboard... there re three cats spawning.
---
If it does work that's really convenient. A good way to keep the pylons active for longer
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much to be honest, outside of a lot of cloth from prewar money, they generally aren‚Äôt worth the time to install and hunt down. I do t even bother picking them up.
---
Better get that woodchucker perk and get some logs while you're there. I remember once driving through WV when it was covered in ice, but the roads were fine.
---
I found myself just staring at the scenery a lot and my ex at the time who never really saw ice/snow like that was in complete awe.
---
Been getting this for a while, made sure to check everything and I know for sure this has something to do with fallout 76. I only get these problems when I play this game.
---
I don't know if you still have it but like if you do then I wouldn't taking it :D  
---
But if not it's okayoooo
---
lmao remember when people who were banned said the game was over because they banned everyone?
---
You could nuke Morgantown
---
Thanks! Hope you enjoy. I'll apologize in advance if anything goes horribly wrong. Lol
---
Are you on ps4, if so how many you need?
---
What is your platform?
---
Short of having a second PS4 you'll need a middleman you can trust that both accounts are friends with.
---
- 1st account join friends server and hand off items to buddy, quit, sign out
---
- 2nd account signs in, joins same friend's server, picks up items, does happy dance!
---
As an aside if you do ever find yourself with two PS4's, you only need one PS+ account to play both characters at the same time (which may or may not be a good thing)
---
- Purchase second copy of game for new PS4 (should be ~$15 these days)
---
- Use the account with PS+ on the second PS4 (non-primary) as you're allowed to access PS+ features from a non-primary console if you're the PS+ account holder
---
- Use the non-PS+ account on the original PS4. Non-PS+ accounts can use the PS+ online game privileges if the console is registered as "primary" to a valid PS+ account
---
"Oh shit"
---
No trading on this sub unfortunately.
---
Nuke just a skooch south of Whitesprings Station. Throw on Green Thumb. The trees around the station have glowing sap, as well as netron pods (silt beans). Should also have some of Whitesprings in range to get a few ghouls for the crafting mats.
---
This is a great point, so i wont be able to totally get rid of my defensive perks.
---
Do you know if i can wear under-armor in the stealth-suit?
---
The rifles arent magic effect weapons, they are just naturally hard hitting. The shotguns are bugged and doing far more dmg due to their "magic" effects.
---
Spent an hour on this last night all because I wanted to rotate a floor tile so it would match the floor pattern correctly.  Thought of just hiding it with a rug, but my OCD with having it look right wouldn't let me.
---
They're destroyed, but you can still build on them if you move a camp there. I had it in my head that you could use gold scrap to trade in to the Vault, which isn't true, but I moved one of my camps to one of those destroyed extractors, and I could still put one on the node.
---
Just make a new toon. That's what I had to do, it gets pretty tuff to level quickly after level 300 lol
---
I need two and yes I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Looks like you stacked foundations.  If you did, that may be your problem.
---
I kept getting disconnected every 15 mins the other day on ps4. And one blue screen crash. After about 4 maybe 5  disconnects it finally stabilised and was able to play for 6 hours with no problems.
---
I found a potted plant on my roof!
---
Whenever you encounter a brown bear with bathrobe and his croco friend in backpack, it's probably me lol
---
Most serums have a bad description. Bird bones doesnt mention the slow fall you get, plague walkers negative effect is written incorrectly. Nukes and dragons character builder or youtubers have listed the correct positive and negative effects
---
I tried white springs but everyone cleared out the ghouls I can‚Äôt seem to get the hardened mass
---
THAT!
---
My three methods are:
---
 * Stop playing the day before when close to level up (I don't start until the new Dailies are in anyways, so now overlap)
---
 * 4 Bonded Event Team, Well Rested, XP boost Food, SBQ Event
---
 * Start a new character, run to Wayward and Overseer Camp, get to level 3 from early quests (getting to level 2 doesn't seem to count).
---
ohhh thx :)
---
My mistake :(
---
Tbh I don't have much trouble with poison because 2 of my armor pieces got the poison resi effect which is more useful for a bloodied melee then sentinel or something.
---
My main is 400+ and let me tell you I have no idea what the fuck I am doing most of the time. I am just trying to stay out of everyone's way.
---
How do i get one?
---
Ignoring my other post. They need to get rid of this challenge for Daily. Just do a set XP amount to get for the Daily, or "Level Up or Get 5000 XP" or something so it doesn't discriminate low levels OR high levels.
---
Well, there are players with much higher levels... [https://i.gyazo.com/d697b2a8184b9524f96847e57064940a.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/d697b2a8184b9524f96847e57064940a.jpg)
---
Took that screen back in april.
---
Always shows the quality of the community, whether its staggering under the weight of loot from the Queen or from Uranium fever people are generally efficient and respectful at the nearby vendors
---
R/whyweretheyfilming?
---
Or finding that perfect weapon but its lvl 15 : (
---
Yes. It looks silly
---
Okayo, be there in a sec  
---
That's okay by me, I'm curious about somethin :)
---
PERFECT answer! So 50cal ammo is cheaper than 308? Thats good to know and good advice on shooting in the air and getting the speedy receiver. I only used it exclusively on the queen once and was waiting until it landed like I normally do... i only got a single arrow when she died smh. And you're right, the ammo depletes SUPER slow in comparison to everything else I have
---
What level are you to be a scare tactic ü§î what level were the rest of the players
---
And FWIW, The Fixer awarded from this quest line has a preset level of 30 regardless of the level of the player completing the questline. I just did it this weekend on a new char who was L60 something and the rifle was still awarded as a L30 item.
---
Trolling pure and simple, probably couldn't help fight the mobs as was beating off too hard to aim a gun.
---
This is the darkest timeline.
---
From fo76? Why?
---
Bethesda rep: "passing this along to the team"
---
Translation: oh look another bug, better tickle their ears with some sweet nothings
---
I've been savagely victimized by Insult Bot 24 times!
---
I wanted a picture of the mothman in the light for my background, and it just so happened somebody jumped at that moment
---
That is of course true and apart from killing robots occasionally and visiting the vendors the only reason now I go to Watoga.
---
Is your IGN the same as on here? I just received a friend request notification went to accept but it wasn't their I'll try to add you
---
Duping. Despite having no evidence whatsoever. Matter of fact, they even banned my grandad who deliberately avoided 76 for the entire dupe wave.
---
Sent you an invite IGN DefinitelyRothen
---
I just throw it with the rest of the Mirelurk meat. I can't tell the difference.
---
Jet will make you jittery üò¨
---
This is one of the "SBQ melters" due to a prefix / fire rate glitch that the game engine apparently has trouble with and generates way more damage than it should
---
There are YT videos that review the various prefixes and major attributes that cause this to happen from Angry Turtle if you're curious
---
RadShield also doesn't affect mutations.
---
How do you install the door? I still haven‚Äôt figured it out. (PS4)
---
That would make sense I guess, and they pivoted at some point.
---
Add mestethezombie
---
It was in Fallout 4, so idk why it's not in here already
---
Being a few hundred short, travel to sell and then see them leave as you're on the way back.
---
Oof
---
I will sit down a wait my turn
---
Looks awesome.
---
But I love missing 20 shots in a row with an automatic handmade at 95% hit chance!
---
Fuck this game.
---
I was doing the event yesterday! So maybe it was me there!
---
Spare lead is really only lead waiting on another resource before becoming ammo. No such thing as too much 5.56.
---
This is why blanket banning should not only be stopped but made illegal altogether. I managed to get my grandad back on 76, but that was a difficult fight. Can‚Äôt say they‚Äôll budge on me though. Too many innocent people were caught up in it.
---
something that I found out worked. if you are ok with playing nuclear winter . The XP for that doesn't count until you log back in at least according to SCORE. so: start a new char. Play NW until you level up . log back in challenge done
---
I don't understand why they made it that we can only convert a tiny amount at a time :S
---
\*Queen and her aoe poison cloud wave in the distance\*
---
thx for that:)
---
i def do this too. i even switch teams sometimes to hit multiple camp stores or go somewhere specific. you keep your bond with teammates for awhile, so if you switch back you keep the team bonus.
---
3 teammates is up to 9 more fast travel spots (camp, survival tent, player)
---
I noticed the same all over the place, not just camps, and most notably Whitesprings.  Approach a closed door, open it, a quick flash of graphics showing the door already open and now closing.  Step back a few feet, approach the door again, and reopen.  Annoying!
---
Why do I randomly take damage walking around on an empty street?
---
Why does it take me an ever-increasing number of attempts to fast travel anywhere?
---
It's worth noting I'm (fairly) low level. I don't have chemist, super super, or the stim recipe
---
\*Unarmed Bloodied weapon laughs tries not to laugh\*
---
Used my primed two shot LMG a lot during Fasnacht. It is a fun gun, but ammo wise it‚Äôs a bit costly. Priming it helps a bit but farming flux is such a pain. Only gun I have that‚Äôs more ammo hog-ish is my Gauss minigun.
---
Man don‚Äôt build at workshops more than you have to, also the materials that are in green are using the workshop allocated stock not your own.
---
Yeah, that's what I was going for, but even within that, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  I'm kind of assuming that it has something to do with the invisible ramp, which is why I marked it as a bug.  There really should be some sort of provision to make sure you can still remove the last foundation piece if the only thing attached to it is a set of stairs.
---
Submit a ticket
---
Hilarious.
---
I think you need to buy her a digital camera next.
---
You cant make another account or is it just that you dont want to play after losing all of that work?
---
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!?!?!?
---
Sorry didn‚Äôt know what level you would be. But chemist is only 1 point in perception and super duper is in luck just be on the look out. But you can do the tick blood but it‚Äôs a real grind. I use to do that until I found my collect tron for blood packs for me. What system you play on
---
Oh then i did see you
---
And now with junk walls supposedly coming I can finally make a proper town camp!
---
I like your style üòÄ most girls like flowers, you got her fallout 76 üëçüèºüëçüèº awesome!
---
One of the best things about public teams I‚Äôve found is all the cool new people I‚Äôve met.  I only run events and play 6-10 hours a day (nothing else better to do locked away in COVID). I‚Äôll be on the lookout and say hi if we meet again.
---
This is something I‚Äôve run into quite a bit. My saving grace though is having F1st. 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôm able to rejoin into the same private server and still have my fully kitted workshop in place.
---
I just hop it to play hide n seek. Then quit to adventure mode
---
You could make a low level account and lvl it up and then switch back. I have a friend who is a little over 1000 and that‚Äôs what he does. Ik this isn‚Äôt what the post is about, but it is a work around for higher leveled.
---
I *could* make another account, but losing literally my entire inventory on all 5 characters really fucking hurts. And I put just over a thousand hours into this piece of shit game in the hopes that it‚Äôd improve. It‚Äôs like an abusive relationship you don‚Äôt want to get out of.
---
Patch 20 broke my commando character‚Äôs most important perks.
---
Other power armor is better but if you want to have a carry weight bonus excavator is the best. It gives 100 bonus then you get calibrated shocks and that gives another 100
---
There is nothing more heartbreaking than when this happens. The only thing I could suggest is to make a note of other players on your server when you take one, and that way if it happens again you may be able to rejoin them and get back to that server. Public teams also help with this, I believe. (I could be wrong, though - I'm not sure how it works with PC and total shutdown, but sometimes when you get back in it will automatically rejoin you to your team on Xbox, at least, so maybe similar?) I've had it happen before a few times, and nothing makes you want to throw something faster.
---
I jump all the time from the top during the enlightenment event with stealth armour. Never a problem
---
Oh I've found plenty of t-60 pieces, I was just trying to learn the plans to craft it.
---
Absolutely. I'm doing it right now for only my second time. Started like 2 weeks ago.
---
Nope all there. Wasteland just added a new quest line on top with factions
---
Looks like he‚Äôs gonna fight mid air
---
How do i get calibrated shocks im neww
---
And people were saying ARK building system is worst lol
---
Darn.
---
I did. But I fixed it on my own by removing the skin and moving my camp so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be looked at. I‚Äôm also trying to prevent others from having to rebuild.
---
With the Legendary Run going on the XP boost from having a ridiculously high Int (Unyielding bonus from low health) is why I came back to Bloodied. 
---
Personally I have more fun with my Berserker build, but feel compelled to squeeze out as many of the 10k XP for 100 SCORE boosts as I can get...
---
You ever see that meme with the Ostrich running from the Leopard, and it's captioned "Shitshitshitshitshitshit"?
---
I'd imagine that is what it's like.
---
I've had people bolt when I was in the 150 range and going to drop plans and aid.
---
Then again, the Ritual Bindings and Mask didn't help the situation. It's either Daredevil or Manta Man outfit for that, I guess.
---
The only guaranteed spawn point I know of is at the Philippi Battlefield Cemetery where you bury the remains of the soldier for the "Buried with Honor" quest you get from the Curator at Prickett's Fort.
---
Go get one and join the \*boink\* squad today! :D
---
Today I died precisely as I completed the objective. It would not have been possible for me to end so perfectly.
---
I couldn't have been more pleased to hit Z to quit and get back to playing Fallout.
---
I had someone kill me wearing almost invisible power armour yesterday. It definitely wasn't a stealth boy as they were still invisible while shooting and when they looted me I could see the PA texture not the stealth field effect. It was just like 95% invisible very odd... On PS4 so maybe a glitch dunno
---
Was just about to say the same thingüòÇ
---
What‚Äôs really going to grind your gears is when you drop a metric ton of atoms to finish early, you still get the notification for challenge but you don‚Äôt get any reward.  Not even a token amount of caps unless I‚Äôm missing something.
---
It is simple stats.
---
As I said; the Xbox thing is promotional. Not actual. Notice how it barely ever changes?
---
Hell yeah! I aint burying a noob that died in a war and wont respawn. He should learn how to respawn again soon.
---
This. Make an alt. For some reason level 1-2 doesn‚Äôt count. You‚Äôll be level 2 when u leave vault 76. Wander down and shoot a couple of those pesky russian robot things and stroll into town and you‚Äôll be level 3. Done. Next day either wander down and do the farm hands quest...chance of responders.  And you‚Äôll gain a level. Then reset and do it again easy
---
I have not noticed this bug with shotguns. And I use it alot
---
Also you dont need a bloodied weapon, it's nice to have for the extra damage. But i run a bloodied stealth commando i can one shot most enemies with a non legendary handmade or fixer. But when you got the right weapon then the game is just easyüòÖ
---
New River Gorge resort. It's a reliable source for me.
---
I usually farm there for Glands, and Bleeding Kate's for Stingwing Barbs, and everything else I never have a shortage of for the Stings and Things daily.
---
You can buy the plan from the responders vendor in the main building at white springs, or another player can add it for you. It takes flux to install,  I think violet
---
When someone does that to me, I usually wait until they've stepped back, exit the vendor then immediately go back in. Do that a few times until they get the message. 
---
Did it to one who wouldn't stop. I waited until he backed up a few paces left he vendor spun around to face him drawing my pistol (which always looks like a quick draw in 3rd person), then as soon as he was spooked I turned and activated the vendor again.
---
Full bloodied is great but a low health junkies build is probably more ur flavor. Its the same concept, except u dont quite need to be as low health as a bloodied, i run both and and go bloodied for grinding and junkies for getting sweaty, both work great
---
I guess Bethesda doesn't mind ruining NW for those who actually enjoy it, just to inflate the player statistics for bean counting.
---
BOLD! Do you get a ton of millage out of 3 ranks of Glow Sights when not in a nuke zone??
---
I know, it's right there at the bottom of the OP.
---
Ahh okok thank youu
---
I didn't know this came out for ps2.
---
Also, the mobs - especially ticks, mirelurk spawn, and molerats are there exclusively to piss off stealth characters.
---
Completing the BOS questline gives you a set of Ultracite PA if you want to save on mats.
---
Maybe try to also nuke Drop Site V9 and Forward station delta so people have to attack the Queen from the Sundew grooves. The queen will land frequently so there will be a lot of enemies on the ground to distract people from shooting the queen + more XP and more legendary enemies.
---
There‚Äôs always that 1/100000 Chance of rolling a pink or indigo bat.
---
What doing all the forbidden knowledge stuff and everything? :)
---
Oh steel is very easy to come by
---
Oh, I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt see it. I just woke up and am rather tired so I didn‚Äôt notice it. Sorry.
---
Me as well and please everyone else feel free to do the same in a group I am in.  There is really no reason not to always be in a group at this point, even considering Lone wanderer you are better off having heard mentality and empathy mutations and replace it with inspirational and be in a group
---
I notice it change sometimes though
---
Probably the worst that can happen is that tens of thousands of players join games just long enough to complete their challenges and then quit out of the game or get their entire team killed before quitting out of the game. This results in longer wait times between matches for all of the people who actually want to play nuclear winter I'm guessing.
---
Swap it with "Use a Level Up Point" - I'm sure most high levels have some banked, low levels can earn them easily enough leveling up.
---
I hope, one day, that BGS will increase the size of the map....
---
We found a friend but thank you so much for offering
---
Basically junk for us higher levels, huh?
---
10 weeks total. So sept 8 I believe
---
There are other reasons to play games?
---
Right up until the end.
---
So you can actually find them also but yes the plan is around 6k caps and you can get at Camden park also. But it takes 6 violet flux for each one. I mean I‚Äôm seriously rocking my level 25 power armor excavator because I can carry 575 when I eat ribeye steak. The xo1 power armor only can do 4 something. So I never really change it. Only crappy thing is there is no jet pack for it. I was going to buy t65 or strangler heart but what‚Äôs the point I can‚Äôt carry everything I carry with them.
---
Yes you can still do original main and side quests
---
Wait cursed pickaxe?
---
Seems to be a pretty crashy day today.
---
I remember being in this situation once or twice. My tactic is usually to sneak up on one of them, blow my cover then shoot the ground 4 times, then spin and shoot a bush, then die. It always works to ensure I don‚Äôt place 1st. #humblebrag.
---
I stop there every day to find out where the squatters are. Because that is my favorite daily quest.
---
Tickets aren‚Äôt just to fix your issue, they are used to raise the broader bug with the team. The more people that report the problem, the better chance the bug gets at being prioritized.
---
Not really, It's just there for the occasional glowing creature i might come across,like Mole miners and such. And there isn't much else I'd use in that slot.
---
I wish I liked the legendary run more than I do. 
---
The concept is fun and I enjoy the public teams a lot.  I just don't find the rewards to be anything great. Seems to be a  lot of the same stuff over and over. Ghillie paint, PA paint, caps, scrip, etc. Nothing that I really will use.
---
I just decided to give the game a bit of a break and wait for some new stuff like Colossal problem and Meat week .
---
That's another design choice I don't really get. I get that they won't allow you to bank any roll over score but not giving you anything at all seems overly harsh.
---
"however I have to dedicate a full day of gaming to build a new place."
---
A full day or even days, a good camp can easily have 10 to 15 hours of work in it, I know how that feels. Build the structure a few times to get exactly what you want. Then decorate and tweak, tweak, tweak until it's perfect. Then realize there is something else you want to add or remove to fit budget. It's a vicious cycle. Lol

"But the place I have now I love so much I think I'm keeping it for a long time."
---
This right here is why I have 4 low levels characters, I have such a hard time getting rid of good builds. My main I doubt I'll ever move now because of how much I like the camp he has now, one of my early alts has a camp I'll probably never tear down. Then I have 2 with camps built that I really like, and the last one is in the middle of a move, just can't find the perfect flat spot that is roadside and large enough for what I want to build. I try to make my camps look like they were placed by the devs when possible, like they are buildings that were intended to be there.
---
Most of the building restrictions are so that people cant make entirely floating camps (not even a set of stairs holding it up) or make camps entirely out of foundations (cause foundations can't be destroyed).  You're running into the latter with your stacked foundation.
---
I think initially they were concerned about pvp balance and people griefing from impenetrable/inaccessible fortresses.  With pvp pretty much dead in adventure and survival removed I wish they'd remove most of those restrictions.  It does not affect my gaming experience in the slightest of someone else's camp floats or can't be destroyed. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You get a full set of ultracite armor through the main quest.
---
Yeah, it's a known way to mitigate the bug, but it still slows you down way too much. Bethesda just needs to fix the damn bug.
---
He shovels. He shovels well.
---
Okay, thank you very much!
---
If i play a game, even a game I dont like, im going to give it a good run. I just had to kill one player, coukd have dropped as i had no teammates left when they were taken out and no one would be the wiser, but I cant do that. 
---
My dad would be pissed if he ever caught wind i wasnt trying my best at doing something i signed up to do. He may be almost 3k miles away, but that wont stop me from still following through.
---
I get that. I just kinda play the game for a few little things I enjoy such as those, bobble heads, and collectibles. I was streaming the whole thing so I got it all on video. I will just send it in to Bethesda and hope it gets through considering all the support tickets they have rn.
---
&gt;I think Bethesda planned to do a regular single player game and when it was done for like 40% Zenimax came and said: "Nah, it's good enough. Just add some vendor bots, holotapes, make it online multiplayer and we good to go making big money out of it".
---
Either that or they had no idea what making an MMO/Looter Shooter/survival/whatever-they-were-going-for actually entailed, so they just made a standalone expansion to FO4, slapped multiplayer on it, and called it a day.
---
This actually happens to me on a lot of doors around the world on console.
---
I'll see a door closed, click to open and the door suddenly appears open and closes, then I have to wait to open it again. Must be the same bug.
---
No, the model is different. or at least the helmet has a unique model, ive never seen the rest of the pieces.
---
Good luck with that. 
---
Their terms of service are on their website before you purchase.
---
Yeah it is slow.
---
And I agree. Just fix the damn game. I love playing it every day but the thousands of small bugs get to you
---
Rad management is easy. Diluted Radaway, Toxic Goo, and Inert Flux. Keep those three things on you at all times.
---
I moved my camp to a lead deposit up by Sunnytop Station and I've had like two visitors over the last week. :(
---
Damn...bloody build achilles heal is getting out..u know how long and hard us bloodied dwellers have tried to keep that a secret?
---
Yeah, some people play games because they are *fun*.
---
Weird, I know.
---
I've considered that option but I have 250+ banked, so it would be way too easy when compared to the level up. :)
---
I'm so sorry I I remember being furious at lower levels, "I'm not paying 20 caps !!" 
---
Ugh so annoying. I'd reccomend scavenging everything from where you are and selling it for train fayre
---
Ha ha ha ha! You are so funny!
---
I'm sure the BoS will have some interest in it when they arrive
---
This is fantastic
---
"95% barely misses" Me: *Misses 5 times in a row*
---
I try to check, but sometimes, life gets in the way. If I have to get up early in the morning, I can't stand around while someone hems and haws at my vendor. (I had time last night, so I waited an extra 20 minutes while this dude bought out a good chunk of my ammo, Bobble/Mags, Chems, and Weapon stock. I don't always have time.)
---
Sometimes, I crash out and I have zero control over that. (I've had that happen mid-sales, and it sucks for me.)
---
And sometimes, I pay no attention and server hop or quit out the game to go do something IRL. I do try to check, but sometimes, I forget
---
Tbh, I think that it's less a prank than you think. I have it happen once in a while. It is frustrating, but I think the person who is doing the vending is the one who gets screwed through lack of sales.
---
They could also be at or near cap limit and the quickest way out is to quit.
---
Not all, my hunting rifle doesn't seem impacted.
---
But the other day it broke on me and I swapped to a Gauss I'd picked up and immediately was missing most of my 95% VATS shots.  It was jarring.
---
"Joining a Group" is easy too.
---
Do remember you fan travel to76 for free.  Also,join a random team as you can travel to random team mates camps for free too
---
They can be a heck of a fight at any level.
---
Last night I was up near Abbies bunker when I ran into a high level legendary mutant behemoth. 
---
Wow...I think that was one of the toughest fights I've ever had. Just like yourself, took ages of jumping around using road guards to block his charges but was a lot of fun.
---
Another workaround seems to be jumping and entering VATS while in the air. I never miss a shot when I do it that way. It's a really odd bug.
---
They have plans to do that. I doubt this year. But maybe in 2021. They have talked about exploring outside of Appalachia. I hope that means across the river.
---
Yeah man it's so much fun! I think Bethesda means in this game that VATS works in the opposite way to other games where you were actually receiving a 95% chance to MISS the shot ü§†ü§†ü§†
---
I like the ghost town aspect of it. The automated high school intercom announcements are creepy when exploring alone.  Like the world just stopped and everyone vanished.  The game would lose a lot of the post-apocalyptic feel if the locations were swarming with people.  And who would want to live beside a scorchbeast queen portal and spot where nukes detonate on the regular anyway?
---
Yes, but level up gives 500 score, the rest 250.
---
I wouldn't complain if they do it but I don't see it happening. :)
---
Thanks for duping and your help in ruining this game.
---
I don't know what I expected. Lol
---
I don't even check the dailies when I log on. Just nuke the bat and you have covered: Kill a legendary enemy, Kill 20 creatures, kill 10 scorched, level up, kill 3 epic enemies, kill 10 robots, complete an event, probably more I don't check until I get back to my camp. Then you cook some stuff, take a workshop and build stuff. Then all that's really left is NW challenges.
---
Dude. If it‚Äôs that big of a deal, make a new character. Go all defaults as quickly as possible since you‚Äôre not actually going to use it. 
---
You level up once before you even get out of the vault.
---
Agreed, looks incredible
---
You mean these?

I'm not even lvl 500 yet but I'm already bored of having to do this same daily everyday. Somedays I just don't want to or can't sit down to farm xp, if it wasn't for the level up and the nw dailies I'd be enjoying the legendary run more, being forced to do so is bringing the enjoyment of the new score system down for me, sadly.
---
I'm the opposite, I finished Beckett's quest and went to the room but did not find a key...I got the other two in the underground but after searching through the room behind the claw I didn't get th doll makers key.
---
I know they have "expeditions" planned - which will probably fast travel points to off-map locations.
---
For future DLC's, I'd love to see Wright-Patterson AFB (which would be to the West, across the Ohio), part of PA (the search for Hoagies), and maybe even the Shenandoah part of Virginia to the South.
---
Freeze bugs.  They are random.  
---
Yesterday I died in Excavator armor and spawned back in.  The game brought me back in with no PA and I fell through the map...it went black and finally had me land with the PA back on with a landing. 
---
Oh, and respawns inside a nuke zone.  Which is not where I was fighting SBQ.
---
While european laws do protect the consumer way better than american laws you're just being a kid throwing a tantrum. 
---
Maybe the law protects you or maybe not but go ahead and sue. And pay hundreds of euros just for the lawyer
---
dummkopf
---
you can play them and they're fun, but they're not nearly as damaging as other builds.  I think something that would "fix" the pistol builds would be the ability to dual wield.
---
They have talked about expeditions but also expanding the map. There‚Äôs plenty of room to do that.
---
Even as a casual player in the lower hundreds I find the level up one the hardest to do. I also don't do NW as I swore a blood oath to avoid PvP at all costs... I probably won't finish the game board but I don't give a fuck about chicken coops and Michelin Man/Pilsbury Doughboy power armor. 
---
I'd prefer more 'Complete [x] Daily' or heck introduce something like 'Photograph [location/person/plant]' or perform those long forgotten Tadpole athletic tracks. I'd also love a 'Kill a target at [x] range', or 'melee a target to death'. Us snipers wanna butt stock smack some hapless bastard every once in a while.... 
---
Weekly challenge of 3x level ups is fair imo though.
---
Pretty sure theres also a TOS when you make a Bethesda.net account
---
The tears of banned cheaters nourishes my soul.
---
Lmao good luck dumbass, maybe dont dupe
---
I play exclusively on private servers, but every now and then i will visit The Wayward on a pubbie server and leave a bag of treats on the ground near the Overseers camp. Plans, recipes, fusion cores, missiles, grenades, hundreds of pounds of boiled water, stims, etc.
---
I think this needs to go, or floating camps need to go(not trying to hate on floating camps) seems dumb its ok to have a huge structure supported by stairs but game makes a big deal about removing a wall.
---
I‚Äôm with you on the rewards not even being that awesome. Some are decent. It‚Äôs the concept of having to complete it that is part of my madness.
---
Exactly. I remember them saying just as much right before the "Anyway, here's Fartnite/NW mode, enjoy your year of content drought" presentation
---
There's also one spawn sometimes at Morgantown station on top of a big bowl towards the parking lot
---
Here's a question for those of you who are at these mighty levels. 
---
Is there any difference to being level say 90? Once you have your build fixed out, your weapons and equipment the way you like them is there anything that changes?  And I'm being serious, I just didn't know if there was something that changed like you get a hitpoint per level or something like that.
---
Once you have your build and have played the story...then it's just do whatever for fun right, no point to grinding locations for XP.
---
This.  Unless you used up all 5 character slots you can literally have that level up in less than 5 minutes and you dont even have to fight anything.
---
Remember the last time germans fought against american non sense? Didnt end well.
---
I kid, i kid , both my great grandparents on my dads side were german immigrants. 
---
In all seriousness though, chances are strong that  you know you broke the rules.... why try some backdoor bullshit to avoid consequences for your actions?
---
Ill definitely try this too :)
---
I'm curious what insurance product covers "sue-ing games publisher because I cheated and they banned my account" ???
---
I've not checked, but I'm fairly confident my house, car, bike and life insurance.....would not cover such things.
---
I did that the other day too, just to see where it would stop me, but it never did. It did slow my walk down to a crawl almost like walking in a swamp or something, though. I figured I'd fall on through, but never did.
---
Awwww, bless your heart - that is so cute.
---
Yeah, that's what truly inspires creativity, rules and boundaries
---
My point exactly.
---
Well, I was still tweaking my build well into level 300...not to mention working to get the perfect weapons as well.
---
I'm currently writing a Fallout 76 Novel, so I play the game to get material - check locations for accuracy and characters as well. It gives me something to grind for, that's not just the game.
---
(Level 531 here)
---
I used to log in and hit all dailies, but then I just stopped because I don't think the game is going in the right direction. The grinds are getting worse, the payoffs aren't worth it, I have the optimal gear, and Bethesda doesn't care about fixing bugs.
---
I'd play more if they actually addressed the game's tech debt, if they lifted the idiotic daily limits and removed the ridiculously low max caps ceiling, if they added alternative ways to gear your character that aren't bullshit RNG, and if they did a complete PvP overhaul.
---
But instead, they're adding another bullet sponge boss with the same stupid RNG gear drops, another bullshit grind with legendary perks that's just going to lead to more XP exploits, and another "faction" with the same dumb reputation grind and daily fetch quest. No fucking thanks.
---
Yeah, pretty much.  
---
I love the game, but I don't love every facet of it.  Nuclear Winter doesn't interest me, and grinding SCORE doesn't interest me.  Grinding XP doesn't either.  Never has.  I like exploration, quests, and stories.  
---
Right now I'm just logging in out of habit and not really enjoying it much.  Just trying to get my set of Unyielding Thorn Armor built.  I can't even be arsed to grind all of the daily scrips for it past 150, though.  If I could get 100,000 scrips today and get that armor, I don't know what I'd do.  Nothing else is interesting me currently.
---

It seems that everyone else who have commented have found this to work. So maybe you are doing something wrong :)
---
*shakes magic 76 ball* answers lean toward yes, but may easily change when they decide to disable them for another month
---
Dupes didn't ruin this game, RMTers ruined this game. Legacies have never been "rare" because they were duped in such massive quantities. However they very rarely came up for trade and it was usually just so the poster could say "no" to every single offer to drive up that weapon's "value." Dupers/RMTers are basically like how De Beers is to the diamond trade, except with duped items. We should call them Du Peers
---
I'm on my 3rd playthrough now (because I have a problem) and it just means more main quests at the start. Everything is available, but some locations have changed.
---
We'll get over it.

I went through and made a list of all the things I needed to take a picture of so that whenever I saw one of them I could just pull out my camera and take a picture. A lot of the things will spawn during the SBQ fight.
---
I would recommend 4 in cha to swap lone wanderer w travel agent + hard bargain, as well as action boy/girl and serendipity. if in pa swap serendipity w bloody mess/one gun army and swap sneak out w dodgy. i run both stealth commando and pa heavy guns using 2-2-2 in the weap damage perks.
---
- this is some additional advice to whats already been posted about the damage portion of running bloodied
---
Do you use the Gauss Shotgun?
---
If you have the time before an enemy charges, counting to 2-Mississippi, while targeted in VATs, generally helps me to combat this bug!
---
Thanks for the 2nd option.
---
Make an alt that you use in NW, the level ups for low level adventure characters come easy
---
I can‚Äôt argue with this. I wish I had your willpower lol.
---
Oh i havent tried this one before. Will definitely try and use this too, thanks!
---
But Fallout 1st subscriptions will save the game! 
---
I honestly hate what this game has become. The relationship between fans and developers is literally just constant leniency. We‚Äôre *always* having to let them off for creating poor updates.
---
The devs did no such thing, at least not intentionally. Your camp allies use furniture. Rather than specify which they can use, they have a general ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù AI package, which basically means they will walk around and use objects within a certain radius to appear like they have a life. It‚Äôs nothing special, but if it matters to you, you can spawn near objects your see random raiders/settlers using and your ally may use it too.
---
Agreed.
---
I don't mind the NW challenges, I don't do them but it's a nice addition for those who enjoy NW.
---
We should enjoy doing those challenges, not be forced to chose between skipping them, accepting the tedious nature of them or use a toon.
---
I follow her too. She is really talented and her builds are gorgeous.
---
I tried to rework my camp just last night to give it more of a modern feel. It's definitely a work in progress for me.
---
Of all the arguments against banning I have heard, this one is...
---
...the wurst.
---
Ya, if the rewards were really great I would probably be a lot more invested.  It's that I only find about a dozen of them even half interesting.  Seems like Bethesda just threw a bunch of stuff together for rewards that they couldn't build a theme around. Idk
---
I think the only thing I would pay for would have been the clean sink and that was an easy get right off the bat.
---
Shhh, its a secret :)
---
Drives me crazy that the lockpick and hacking perks are individual instead of ranked up to 3 like everything else.  I wish they were permanent passive skills once you earn them actually.  Makes no sense to swap them in and back out just to open a frickin' chem box.  My problem is I often forget to swap perks back in and I run around with things like Fix It Good enabled instead of combat perks.
---
Fallout is a single player series and many, myself included continue to play it as such in 76. I dont want or require help from anyone, but a 25% xp bonus is a 25% xp bonus.
---
And turning off voice chat was one of the very first things i did after loading up the game and exiting the vault for the first time. I have not turned it back on now that public teams have been put in the game.
---
As a German American I do find this comment offensive. 
---
As an American, I am now really hungry for some barbecue.
---
Same for me. I'm doing all the stuff and log out. Reason: I don't want to miss out on cool designed things, when Fallout 76 suddenly becomes a really good game with endgame progression and stuff to do. Probably around 2023. Until then: I'll do it!
---
Even the one people really wanted, the ammo converter, they borked into oblivion lol.
---
That is really good to know!!
---
Maybe they have already logged and passed them on, genius.
---
Ya!
---
From my own experience, a lot of new players are very well versed in the old Joestar secret final move.
---
It's probably not nearly as fast as your method, but in my immersed head it's like my character taking an extra second to line up the shot, haha.
---
Niiiiiiice!
---
Hello fellow cat lover :)
---
There is a place north of Welch and north west of Welch train station in the ash heap where a friendly cat spawns and you can camp there.   I do not believe he can be harmed either.  His name is Murgle.
---
Or bird bones mutation
---
Haha love it. It‚Äôll all pay off!  One year. Or three.
---
That's on you for buying out the board with a bunch of weeks left.

I ended up just keeping my forager with a chef hat and bathrobe for ambiance lol

Ugh, I learned this last night. Then I ran out of wood. Lol. Try again tomorrow I guess.
---
Uh...I known it is too late now, but why not save your atoms for later when they are worth more?
---
Edit:  but, hey, why not have SCORE challenges reward atoms again?
---
In the Ash Heap there is a cat named Murgle (I think) at a pre-built cafe. It's a great spot to have a little camp set-up. It even has water access I think

Also what does that do to your premiums if you file a claim over something like this lol.

I chuckled a bit reading this and you being banned sparks me with joy. Here, have an UPVOTE sir.
---
I built a new PC recently and sadly still got the problem on the new rig, but thanks!
---
Yea and I did all that grinding to get as gilli skin and .... I hate it had to grind nw for the outfit
---
Willpower's got nothing to do with it. Once you realize the grinds are all pointless and your accomplishments in this game don't matter, you're free. The game is like Grima Wormtongue; once you stop listening, the game loses its power.
---
Most of us are slaves to the grind, those who deny are, well, probably deniers.
---
Got my main account temp banned (yes I did, spawn of Satan me). Was playing the daily Pavlovian response of "muh dailies". Not having fun at all. The irony of having a daily grind in an open world game is kind of, ironic really. You can do anything you want. But if you don't do this first then FOMO will devour you. Nah.
---
There are 2 maybe 3 tops rewards that I'd want and for HOW much work? Hundreds of hours. I have most of the gear I'd ever wanted so I needed to change the way I played or stop.
---
3,000+ hours into the game there *is* still fun to be had BUT it has to be on my terms, achieving my own goals. Not grinding for some hideous cosmetic item.
---
Levelling new characters, wandering the map, making unique CAMPs. That's the new end game for me.
---
A lot of negative reinforcement in this game: peer pressure, materialism (yes, in a virtual space), FOMO.
---
"Oh look I have an absolutely disgusting hat that cost me 30K - but it's rare!11"
---
"Why aren't you grinding rep or bullion? LOL"
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a life altering addiction. Like I‚Äôm not ignoring real life things. Just my poor other games suffer and would probably like an intervention. Please play me lol.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
I'√¨ll try it, honestly I've tried only with my four old characters, ty!
---
Loadouts are already on the table for release later this year.

They've already said this is a future feature and is on the current roadmap.

I'm not xbox. but I am pretty sure there is a dead body that spawn in the savage divide that always has Halloween costumes . You can also check the scary house? If your looking for Halloween costumes I know the clown stuff spawns there .

Can confirm that Gun Fu is a life saver for my bow. 95% is a more "accurate" representation when it comes to how many of my first shots miss, but after getting the initial kill, my bow will more often than not hit the next 3-4 &lt;20% headshots, sometimes even through obstacles.

VATS sure ain't broken or anything.

I have a cooler with a sign that says 'free soup' because I make a ton.  Sometimes when I get back the soup is gone and I'm like "I hope whoever took them needs them and didn't just sell it all for caps."

if im at a public event my usual thought is hey i bet ill be in the way a lot lol

As a parent of two under two... it is definitely good to assemble all that stuff ahead of time, but a lot can wait. Changing table is a must though.

It only seems that way cause the good venders got banned. I'm ok with the exchange

Respawning inside a nuke zone happened to me yesterday. Died at V9 for reasons unknown and respawned right next to FSP. Died pretty much immediately again and respawned back at V9. I have no idea how or why this happened.
---
Not for power armor. And you can only show off one armor at a time
---
Carry some toxic goo from WesTek, way better than dirty water. Also inert flux for more fine tuning.
---
I personally like building CAMPS. I put off the first seasons week as I had a CAMP to do man so to hell with the grind. I can't sleep if my CAMP isn't right....
---
Im not talking shitty floating crap boxes or turret-laden shanties with way too many clashing cosmetics crammed in for maximum dick-pull, but proper Fallout-style buildings that blend into the environment as if they belong there. 
---
.... Okay well my recent Donut diner isn't exactly true to lore but the previous ones were.... ;) 
---
Getting absorbed into Appalachia is how I forget how fucked my job is. I'm sure I'm not alone in that.
---
Indeed. I would also like more options.
---
We can‚Äôt even build the mouthharp at our camps..
---
Yes! And some characters like Rose and MODUS now have dialogue!
---
I'll check if i can craft any T51 pieces
---
Don't get discouraged. I'm right near a train station and a junk node and I still have days when no one pops by. Tomorrow you'll probably be flooded.
---
What‚Äôs sad is I‚Äôve really been wanting to rebuild my camp from scratch. Haven‚Äôt even used some of the damn camp items I earned. But I know the time I spend trying to rebuild is time taken away from getting the daily grind done. Pretty dumb thing I‚Äôve gotten myself into.
---
Haha yeah thats a pretty good and interesting way to view it!
---
CAMP limitations, things that haven‚Äôt worked from the start (the metal wall cabinet), placing things on the floor above you, random intersects that make no sense, can‚Äôt build floors without a stair first and also can‚Äôt attach floors to foundations consistently, can‚Äôt have internal walls with wallpaper both sides without glitches, stairs basically take up 3 lengths because you need a block to access the front, a block for the stairs and a block at the top. Lights are terrible, bulbs are insanely bright and oil lamps take loads of budget. That‚Äôs JUST camp building.
---
There is a 76 mod manager that has a nuclear winter mode that disables your mods and re enable them when you are done. I've been using if for about a year.
---
It‚Äôs a great feeling when your camp is appreciated by other players. My old spot, players would give me thumbs up. But the new location and design gets me more. I‚Äôve had people leave gifts. I‚Äôve even had people send me messages if I‚Äôm not at my camp. 
---
Camp building, while it has its frustrations, is very fun and it‚Äôs great to see people‚Äôs creativity.
---
No. They did that to the SBQ (by accident and *still haven‚Äôt fixed it*), look what that‚Äôs done? Made it near impossible to keep the bitch on the ground. Land for .1 second and instantly fly back up for five minutes.
---
True that. Been wanting to redo my camp for months and keep putting it off to get the stupid grind done. It‚Äôs maddening and self torture lol.
---
THAT'S why it didn't show up when I tried to equip it! I mean honestly a skin for my camp seems super silly and lame anyway, but having to move my camp to get it to apply is extra dumb.
---
While I disagree with your post, the idea of calling the dupers "Dupeers" after the diamond cartel is funny. 
---
Diamonds are not that rare, folks!

Edit: spelling

I agree with the idea being one that‚Äôs hamstrung by its content. It‚Äôs cynical to stretch out one power armor paint over several different squares, and the endless ghillie suit entries elicit more sighs than anticipation. In between we have nothing that higher-level players want or need - perk card packs and a smattering of bullion, scrip, and atoms. 
---
Of course, there‚Äôs a handful of desirable things, but spread so damn thin that getting one will almost inevitably feel like an anti-climax after the work you had to put in.
---
It's easy to have massive balls when there are no consequences.
---
I‚Äôd o my play NW if the points were worth it.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 pro, I don‚Äôt get crashes that many times, it‚Äôs very frustrating. 
---
I also remove my power lead from the rear of my console to clear the cache, that might help.
---
same. dead things count as well. project paradise is good as well
---
Okay. I have no doubt I'll be doing tweaks with builds for a long time as well...and certainly looking for weapons (3 level 80+ and another one at 55 and do you think I could get just ONE explosive shotgun???ARGH).
---
So far for last week, my legendary battles: 6 scorch queen, 1 behemoth, 1 wendigo colossus, 9 scorchbeast, 3 sheepsquatch, 7 super mutants, a dozen or more other assorted. All high level - most at 2 or 3 stars. I know it's not much for some of you - it was for me, I work a lot of long hours so don't get as much time to play as I'd like.
---
My rewards - *5*!!!!! shovels (one of which was 3 star, and one 1* instigating), 3 lead pipes, 1 explosive pipe bolt pistol...argh...2 pool cues, 1 scout armour leg, 5 assorted leather limbs, several assorted assassins weapons. Only good weapon I got was a Vampires MG42...on the same character who was carrying an identical Vampires MG42.
---
After a while it starts to get depressing. I can only imagine how it must be for some really high level characters who have my level of luck :-)
---
At your level, 2H melee, raider PA and a level 10 BSS sledgehammer was all I needed. Still took a while and quite a few Stimpaks but...
---
You wont do shit and you know it as well as we do.
---
I hear you, I hardly level anymore. I was at about level 300 when Wastelanders dropped and think I hit 330 this weekend. 
---
Granted I don't run a ton of events anymore and spend most of my time farming legendaries. 
---
I was really disappointed to hear about the card/coin system for the legendary perks. I was hoping it used 50 level tiers to select and upgrade cards.  Knowing you need to reach level 1600 to rank up six cards is pretty demoralizing tbh.
---
I've been having the same issue for months, and as i run full bloodied builds on all of my characters, i die a lot, and on my melee character approching the imposter or the SBQ results in a death in about 25% of the time if i don't one shot them.  
---
This is extremely frustrating and actually it's like the only bug i care about, everything else is meh but this one is a game killer.
---
Nothing beats killing a Wendigo Colossus &amp; getting a 1\* Berserkers Rolling Pin....
---
That‚Äôs cool thanks. Going in holiday for 2 weeks so mid August I‚Äôm gonna have to buy about 25 levels to keep up. 
---
That‚Äôs 3750 atoms. To go on holiday.
---
I also find waiting 2 seconds is just as effective. You'll find a lot of times that 95 will drop back to a 70 or so
---
Since it's a quest reward, it's one of the best you can get for free in game. Strangler heart and T65 are better but you need gold bullion. If it's for carry weight purposes then Excavator is better since carry weight mods are a pain to get. I'm still trying to get calibrated shocks for it.
---
in the costume shop, near 79 vault
---
Well. He wasted every bit of ammo he had trying to get me. Then I gave him more. 
---
Low level players wasting ammo is either ballsy or stupid. But touch√© to the chap for trying.
---
Those are side quests, you need to finish the Brotherhood main questline
---
It‚Äôs funny how people come here to boast about killing someone who hit them in a vendor, then come here to bitch when someone tries to start PvP with them.
---
As a parent of teenagers I feel your pain. At least you get to see your kids. Mine now live in their rooms and only come out for food.
---
He resets Saturday at 8pm eastern.  I personally have had no issues getting stuff from him within 24 hours.  After that you are rolling the dice.  It‚Äôs a known issue.
---
Yeah, dirty water is just easier to grab. If I have Toxic Goo on me I will use it. I also have Rad Barrels but dirty water does the trick in a quick pinch.
---
Agreed about the Legendary perks. But hopefully they revamp the system before it officially drops.
---
They have spoiled..
---
The C.A.M.P. UI showing something as green when you can't place an object there.
---
When stuff like tree branches or grass clips through your C.A.M.P.
---
Important areas like Crater and Foundation not being a free fast travel point.
---
Oh yeah ive seen someone suggest waiting 2 seconds too. Will definitely try this and use it,  thanks!
---
AFAIK the drop rate on that was around 1/1000000. So even if it was duped to hell and back that couldn‚Äôt make it that much less rare. This last Duping wasn‚Äôt like with the presents. It took time to dupe items and since outfits don‚Äôt stack it was one duped item at a time. Even if someone really wanted to heavily dupe this, I really doubt it was done in super high numbers to ruin its status.
---
sure its not just lag? when I log in theres usually a couple of mins before everything syncs up.
---
Yes it is a known issue.  For me, I can only buy on Sunday.  I'm not sure about other folks but for all 5 of my characters if I try to buy on any day other than Sunday I cannot but on Sunday none of my characters have any issues buying.
---
Right, and if the item doesn't fit your build it's even less desirable.  
---
It doesn't help that their isn't any new content along side of the Legendary run.  It might be more compelling to me if there was stuff to do besides the same old events.
---
What are you carrying around that you need 575. When i go out i only carry around 150 while i got all carry weight mods for X01
---
I do believe if I was playing in a team, then I might of been able to jump back into the server I launched the nuke in. 
---
Still, it‚Äôs a pain.
---
I got a 1* assassins rolling pin...no joke...
---
It's become a running joke with my friends that I'll find a new addition to my shovel collection.
---
I've decided that from now on I'm going to create a hall of fame to mount my collection of legendary shovels as I collect them - I've scripted the first 12 I collected, kept 2.
---
Honestly I thought this score daily autocomplete bug might‚Äôve broken me free. First time that happened it was deflating. If it kept happening it might‚Äôve turned me off to it. But it‚Äôs been ok since. I‚Äôm like this with all games though. I‚Äôm big on achievements. Replay games to get the dumbest little score. Pok√©mon Go is another example. Gotta catch them all as they say!
---
rip me at lvl 726
---
Great story! I‚Äôm glad there are players like you out there to help new players. I used to do this a lot and still do it sometimes but I have lost my patience for big-balled-level-6-baseball bat-wielding noobs. As soon as that nonsense begins I bail out. Keep fighting that good fight!
---
I bought her a sony alpha bridge camera last year
---
This is all true actually, people might disagree about my post but it doesn't mean it's false information. There's a group of RMTers who drive up the value of things by either posting it to trade groups and saying "no" to everything, or another method was to ask for the item they already had and offer things at like a 10:1 trade for it. People were able to pay off their student loans with this stuff
---
Interesting. What's the motivating factor? Enjoying the grind or the pain of having slipped down the ladder a little if you do your own thing? Some people seem to treat games like a job. Which for those without one is perhaps understandable and for those with one actually mystifying.
---
I'm fascinated by how people interact with machines and once AI has caught up we will be able to auto-psychoanalyse and have the results laid bare to see. For those with insight, it's already amazing to watch yourself play games and catch yourself doing things on auto-pilot. Kind of like an NPC...
---
I am on xbox and know all power armor plans in the game.  If you still need some help by the time I get hope from work I can craft them for you but I won't be on for awhile.
---
Don't laugh - I know more than a few players who collect shovels.
---
Level 2 counted for me?
---
Leveling up when coming out of the vault doesn't count. I tried that, so i play NW to get level higher much more quickly
---
Oops
---
I know there are is power armor at belching Betty but I am on PlayStation so I can‚Äôt help
---
right on. There's a dog npc on top of the cliff just to the northwest of the abandoned bunker (I think that's what it's called) that's a part of the wastelanders dlc. The abandoned bunker is to the far east of the map, north-west of Watoga.
---
The dog is staying with it's two owners who are obviously now just skeletons. But the loyalty of the dog remains.  
---
While not the best place to build a camp, if you choose to it can look like you have a dog (and a couple of corpses) at your camp. Or if you have fallout 1st, you could drop your survival tent so it looks like the dog is staying there.  
---
I have a plan to make a Daryl Dixon type character with a cross-bow build (not the best weapon, but will work for the character) and am going to build a small camp there eventually so it's like it's the dog he got in The Walking Dead Season 9.
---
I carry my troubleshooters with me all the time, that and my vampires gauss minigun I grab the three pylons and just spray the robots coming in.  I hardly get a shot on the imposter but I still get some rewards.
---
Ya, going from level 300 to 350 was an attainable goal but going insanely high to get a few perks just seems like a bummer.
---
Not sure why Bethesda thinks that would be something to drive me to play.
---
It‚Äôs coming! And yes, I was tired of it already by the end of November 2018 :)
---
The SAM site in the Cranberry Bog by Watoga train station frequently has T51 pieces and if not there, then I think you can buy the plans from the Brotherhood vendors in Watoga and Whitespring.
---
I think the plans might also be on treasure map loot tables which are leveled lists.  Now that you're level 50, you have the widest/best loot options for those maps. This info could be out of date with Wastelanders.
---
Epic
---
Wow you sound like you are having all kinds of trouble and actually even more frustrating then what I'm going through.  Sorry to hear that.  I wish I had some ideas to try but unfortunately I wouldn't know where to start other then trying to open a ticket with Beth or reinstalling.
---
I am still waiting on a reply from them about trying to get credit for the atoms and it's been almost a week now.  Wish you good luck with getting everything sorted out quickly.
---
Don't be too upset, the level 50 version does mediocre to piss poor damage even on a bloody nerd rage pistols build.  You aren't missing anything.
---
I think it's personal now...I run into him a few times a week these days.
---
Possibly the best FO76 picture I‚Äôve seen. Very very cool
---
If you follow the first quest out of the vault you will level up quicker than the time it takes to get a NW match.
---
lol I didn‚Äôt make that up, someone literally said that before and he/she didn‚Äôt want others to ‚Äòmess it up‚Äô. Some players do take their virtual property in Appalachia very seriously.
---
I'd appreciate it! I'm at work currently and won't be home till after 5 (I'm on central time). My GT is my username here, though.
---
she doesn't like flowers much, because she kills most plants she gets lol  
---
too bad there isn't a green thumb irl
---
Man. I‚Äôm still chasing those rad barrels. So instead I turned a Pulowski tube in my CAMP area into a rad shower with some hidden radiation emitters and a floor switch.
---
Well, thanks for the info! I didn't know it spawned there!
---
I totally believe it...the game has finally driven me to shovel hording.
---
Really? So just starting a new character and leaving the Vault was enough?
---

Updates daily. No idea how. Tiz magic
---
I was at a vendor yesterday and a level 11 started shooting me. Now, I don't have pacifist mode on but I don't want to kill anyone. I look at him while he is shooting me and then I take out my gun and the kneeled and threw out heart emojis. I gave him 50 stims and fast traveled away as I was vendor hopping at the time. 
---
Don't make me kill you my fellow players.
---
After you miss a day or two it breaks the hold.
---
I also know Bethesda/ZOS from years of ESO, and have unshakable faith whatever is in the Seasons track will be in the Atomic Store once it's over. Just look at any other bundle.... 5mins later it's back again (and still busted like the Backwoods Camper).
---
They'll wait for everyone to buy their way to the finish, wait a bit, then sell it again for atoms for a double dip at people's wallets. Imagine when people buy like twenty tiles or more (3k atoms?) only to see what they wanted for like 250 atoms..... Ouch.
---
A bunch of weapons. I can carry 580 without power armor. I have all unyielding secret service armor which took forever to get but none have weapon weight reduction. See I had all that on my old armor so I started collecting a bunch of weapons so I need to carry more so I don‚Äôt have to get rid of my hoarded weapons
---
Nah, takes about 20 secs to get into a lobby then 2-3 minutes to play. Plus with the double xp that kicked off Thursday i leveled up 30 times in 4 days. I gained 5 of those levels from NW due to level up challenges and personal interest
---
They should make PVP a group thing like it was. All bethesda has to do is make it so if you have passifist on you won't flag red in group PVP.
---
I have experienced and seen a few things that shows how broken VATS is tho
---
\- Killing a enemy with the gauss shotgun when vats hit chance is at 0%
---
\- VATS missing 3-5 shots in a row when the enemy has 95% hit chance
---
\- hitting and the numbers popping up when shooting an enemy, but the enemy doesnt drop any health
---
\-VATS crit hits sometimes not doing any extra damage when I have the VATS crit perk card equipped ( Not sure what the name of the card is, and of course can just be the perk card that is bugged )
---
Dir fehlt das Grundverst√§ndnis der ganzen Sache.

This is literally why I did the gold grind for my ranged character to get ss chest and jet pack. I literally only wear that armor to build my camp and then put it back in the stash. Spent forever getting my scout armor and I don‚Äôt like the way the ss looks on her.
---
Biv is kinda janky, I have to click on him repeatedly to get his quest and turn it in.  This is on PC.
---
Ah, all my toons are/were already out of the vault, but haven‚Äôt done anything yet (they‚Äôre all banks) so maybe I‚Äôm misremembering.. maybe it is level 3, sorry.
---
For me it has to be the damage glitches with shotguns. You think that charred ghoul is dead? S I K E one taps my bloodied rifleman from behind
---
VATS just refusing to acknowledge a hit 10% of the time (even a crit)
---
Having to go clear out to the main menu to server hop.
---
Trying to use building parts like the contemporary porch just to have it make putting a second floor over it impossible.
---
When I have to pay to fast travel to my own workshop because workshop icons are inconsistently broken
---
The utterly glacial pace and bugginess of quest dialogue and escort NPC pathing (Patrol Duty and the vault heist anyone?). 
---
All the workshop defense events with more than two waves of weak enemies. The enemies are too bad at pathing for this scavenger hunt to be fun and half the time you'll end up with one stuck under the terrain or inside a structure at the end. Or standing right in front of a turret that just cannot see it.
---
(Fixable) that they bound the default keyboard keys like a controller so the same button does like 3 things. Mashing tab to exit vats to suddenly end up in your pip boy isn't fun. Having to make damn sure you won't need to jump or open a door after attaching a wire also isn't fun. Why? Just why?
---
That there isn't a "open door" button in build mode
---
The backwards bolt action rifles (I'm a lefty, but this lefty rifle in the right hand nonsense makes the reload speed like half what it should be)
---
All events should be free to join/fast travel. Just get people participating.
---
Yeah I figured it is pretty much a novelty piece. Wish it was as bad ass as the final word
---
I hope never. My non-sneak bloodied build can‚Äôt survive without this effect. I think fixing it will just create more sneak builds, reducing the number of viable builds.
---
ok.  my GT is also the same as here.  Just shoot me an xbox messasge when you get on and let me know you're from reddit and We can link up at some point this evening.  If you just give me the scrap it cost to make the pieces i wont charge ya anything.
---
Good to know.
---
I only have the bassinet and carseat/stroller combo to assemble.  Gonna take care of those this weekend while it is one million degrees outside.
---
Sometimes I have to go into pipboy&gt;data and make the new quests active.
---
I can't believe Bethesda hasn't built a feature that allows you to rejoin your last server. Just have the server reserve your spot for 5 minutes after a disconnect.....
---
I know if you are teamed up you can rejoin, but solo players get screwed all the damn time by this.
---
How slow/laggy cooking is.
---
Camps saying you can't delete an item even though the structure is anchored somewhere else also.
---
Perks points need an increase by 5 or 10. It's been years. 
---
If I buy a 3* weapon from the purveyor and I'm over level 50, the weapon better be a freaking level 50.
---
Travel Agent needs a second star.
---
No quick change perk load outs. Again, it's been years and the low perk point limit is annoying.
---
Camps need a 50% increase in building area at least.
---
Camps need a budget increase, especially if you want us to keep buying shit from ye olde Atom Shoppe.
---
Some different kinds of dailies for the Raiders and Settlers... why is there only one for Settlers, but two for Raiders?
---
The 200 gold a day limit needs to be doubled.
---
Legendary scrapping needs to double. If you want people running around the wasteland all the time, picking up starred heavy weapons and armor, 150 is a shite limit especially when combined with the stash limit.
---
Legacy tesla, as in QE/JE? Those aren't particularly good. Just sayin.
---
i played all of 3 hours of fallout 4, enough to get to diamond city and be able to change my appearance much more than i was able to at the creation screen. so when i created my 76 guy i thought, hey ill minimize the thing now and select better looking stuff later. apparently it doesn't exist lol. are there any other options or just whats provided and atom shop?
---
Buying on Sunday seemed to reset him for me.
---
1600+ hrs, at this point I don‚Äôt even know anymore.
---
Todd‚Äôs holding me hostage.
---
It happened several times to me, sucks a lot. Now I make sure to visit him every Monday morning.
---
Why would they bring this game out for the new systems. The new consoles are supposed to be downward compatible. So we should be able to play with the existing disks or electronic games. 
---
I am still waiting on fallout new vagas fort the Playstation 4
---
I only buy from him right after the 8pm Saturday reset or Sunday, never later.  Once, at the beginning, I waited until later in the week and I bought 200, expecting to be able to go back later to get the last 100, but he glitched out.  Fool me once......
---
Damn how much is each rank? And so is that green ship really there for no reason or did you pass him
---
I felt like that until the legendary run and my friend roping me back in üòÜ
---
That's a lot. There's some weapon weight reduction perks tho. I can carry around 366 in power armor and 456 out of it. I assume 466 in Excavator then. Anyway yeah hoarding a lot of weapons isn't beneficial unless you really use them constantly
---
That's an option
---
Was this last night? Around 930? I saw the same thing and wished i had taken a picture.
---
Have friends that play, I have fun just mulling around, and camp building mostly. Plus a love for the series as a whole. One of the people that I play with almost every day I met playing on a TF2 community server. I told him to try out New Vegas, and now he‚Äôs gone as far as to be part of the Fallout 2 remake mod team. Gotta love that type of dedication.
---
Primarily the community. I'm big on camp building and most of the people I now regularly play with came about from them asking questions or complimenting my camp. I will say though, it's feeling kind of stale since the ban hammer last week. None of my regs got banned, but the wasteland itself feels different somehow. Might be the lack of good vendors and seems Ike a lot less queens lately.
---
I was actually expecting some of these rewards to accidentally get unlocked for free in atom shop like some items have before. Imagine hitting rank 94 or whatever and that item be made free. Sure would be a dick move to offer up those rewards later at a price. But I guess I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
---
Well in Ohio it was 930.
---
That‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs a drunk abc it takes a bit to get his boozy attention
---
I wasn't particularly in the mood to go around asking the guy about what weapon he was using.
---
Edit: Junk legacy or very good legacy. I can one shot a lvl20 with a two shot western, what does it matter.
---
It's a very simple fix yet bethesda punishes those who enjoy group PVP
---
It was about a month ago, sorry. But apparently a ton of people do this when he appears!
---
It was wild seeing how many bans rolled through, but i welcome them. How about you?
---
Something happened in my game either last night or the night before. We had people jumping for it. Was there a person named drinkingcola86 doing that?
---
The Final Word and the Gatling Plasma are the best out of what you have at the moment. A legendary big gun with Furious would be beneficial to you too. Maybe one with Vampire to have so you can regain health too.
---
I don't enjoy pvp, i only hate standing on the side line when there's something that has to be done.
---
just to clarify for myself, any type of public team or specifically event?
---
Either way it's still PVP lol
---
I know
---
Happened about a month ago, sorry
---
220 in strangler with a gauss mini, junkies explsive plasma gat, and junkies .50, and they were in the 50a I believe
---
No worries. I tried a new toon and you hit 2 just for leaving the Vault and I didn't get it. But if you join/start a Building Team you can hit level 3 really quick.
---
I like farming up water and selling it tho, it's my main source of income. The workshop I farm at is visible from my CAMP, I kinda just consider it an extension haha
---
This also kinda ignores the point. I'm allowed to use my resources as I see fit, I know how the building system works. It's the game crashing and throwing it all out the window that's frustrating
---
I am a level 350 and have only logged into NW twice and that was to cash in for all the free loot I can get before the match starts.
---
I can craft a whole set so which arm do you need
---
Honestly, the chemist mod is the best. The game throws stimpacks at you and at 1lb a piece they can easily creep up and steal all you carry capacity.
---
That‚Äôs the thing I normally do or I scrip what I don‚Äôt. So I‚Äôm a bloodied build so I have a hoard of bloodied weapons but I also have some suppressors some junkies and two shot. I mean I‚Äôm not maxed out. Usually I have around 500 but I carry a lot of chems and stims. I usually have around 130 stims on me plus everything I use. I‚Äôm a fallout first member so I don‚Äôt need to carry junk. So I use my whole stash for weapons I‚Äôm going to sell or eventually use. I‚Äôm a hoarder on these games and that‚Äôs what I built my character around when I started playing everyday again in October. Like when it first came out I played and didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing with perk builds and there was the carry weight glitch so when they finally patched that I already finished main quest and had over 3k weight so I dropped or sold almost everything and I‚Äôm certain there was legacy weapons but I didn‚Äôt know at the time they wouldn‚Äôt be around anymore. But yeah I know I got a problem but it‚Äôs what I do. I actually have just started transferring to a character that‚Äôs level 10 I started on the beta and another character my son started forever ago. But then I just start collecting more. If the scrip daily limit would be more I wouldn‚Äôt have so much.
---
Thank you! Same for me. I'm obsessed with taking pictures. :)
---
I got rid of all my conduits inside thanks to this video https://youtu.be/CRWKRv1ENnQ
---
Hope it helps.
---
Agreed it's infuriating as I like building low roofed buildings using the half walls.  Like COME ON Bethesda u/valseek
---
And keep it on you as your trying to run away. Yet we cant hardly get two shots in with a gatling laser. Reminds me of destiny 2 trace rifles.
---
I was working this quest, trying to get the pilons which just murder me even in the Chinese Stealth armor and after several attempts and dying the server just disconnects me and I've never seen it since. Is it a one-and-done and I missed it?
---
Not being able to rejoin your server if you crash or get disconnected. 
---
Why can't they introduce this feature and give you 5 minute grace period to load back in??
---
SBQ, nuke launches, events, workshops, etc. It's maddening!!
---
I've found that the 1-2 matches it takes to just get the challenge done gets me my fill. I can usually make it to the final 10-12 players before someone with power armor and a damn gauss weapon one shots me from across the circle. 
---
 Other than player kill challenges, you can pretty much treat it like adventure to get your goal completed.
---
There are two RR Garage specific doors that come with the prefab. The side door is located in the build menu under the first tier of door category. The roll-up door is located in the wall menu. The roll-up door has a terrible POV when placing. On the PC it is zoomed in so close to your POV you can't see anything else. I've found it easier to place in from inside the pre-fab. Remove both doors if making a blueprint or getting ready to relocate as they seem to create problems when trying to place them down again.
---
Agreed, Looks Incredible
---
Yeah makes sense
---
Wow.  I seriously had no idea.  Of course what I get out of this is there are a shit-ton of really stupid people who will spend real world money on dumb things..... or is it FOMO that drives them to it?  It is really just a video game.
---
I can get down with that, I legitimately try to get on just to hang with my friends and get that SCORE. Also fallout 2 remake? H Y P E
---
&gt; Why do you play?
---
Items.
---
Definitely! Stupid floater fight...
---
The shock of not having the marsupial mutation in NW was too much.  I felt like I was trying to jump with 80 lbs weights in my shoes.
---
Do it for the loot, always
---
They make good fire kindling and in a "pinch" can be used as toilet paper.
---
Just walk up to where he's supposed to land, the commune option will appear and once you click he'll get his ass down there
---
Whew, I assume that's a vampire gatling gun, but man that seems harder than most scorchbeasts or other higher level enemies. Combine that with being a freakin' assaultron...
---
If you're Allies with them it should be free for sure.
---
3 ranks of serendipity plus stealth is your friend.
---
This. I have to click on him and wait multiple times to both initiate and finish his quests.
---
Create the in camp player terminal that has all the daily's in it. You need to activate it that way once a day for biv to reset the quest.
---
Best place is fort defiance. Once you enter go to the left section. If you hear mole rats then server hop and try again. It‚Äôs usually bugs and can get radroach meat and bloodbug as well if it‚Äôs for the possum challenges.

Sorry, didnt make it on last night.  IRL stuff got in the way.
---
Yes, I have a number of plans, not parts.  I will be on about 12.15p, verify what I have, and let you know.
---
All hail Lord Mothman
---
Easiest daily. Most of the time some other player clears out the location and I randomly get a quest completion come up on my screen.
---
To complete the first season pass and then Uninstall until the next big update comes. 
---
Always hopefully bethesda will make better design choices and change their game to make it less punishing to want to play for multiple hours a session instead of making it a chore to play.
---
I thought they did explain them?
---
Ye, it‚Äôs a remake mod for Fallout 2, just like the Capitol Wasteland Project and Fallout 4: New Vegas. And just like both of those, it‚Äôs gonna be a looooong time until it‚Äôs done...the name for the mod specifically is Project Arroyo I believe.
---
I‚Äôve honestly never seen a trap camp in like 600 hours, but I reckon a lot of that has to do with the fact I see posts like this a lot, so I‚Äôm forever on guard. So thanks I guess to you guys. 
---
I never go inside vendor buildings with any junk on me whatsoever, this goes double if there‚Äôs no stash box in sight literally anywhere at their camp. 
---
I always question whether it was a design decision  to have the vendors in a certain spot, or for nefarious reasons. If they‚Äôre in their own shitty box or the position makes no sense, I‚Äôm not going in. 
---
Also I know that some people hang around their camps to interact with players (I had a great experience with a guy the other day who seemed delighted with the fact I checked out all his rather delightful camp, and dropped me a load of bobble heads for my interest). But generally if you tick any of the above boxes, or you‚Äôre following me about,  I‚Äôll err on the side of caution and check out. 
---
It‚Äôs a shame as I genuinely like interacting with camps and people, and whilst I have nothing really against people who do it, it‚Äôs unfortunate I have to think like that to avoid it. 
---
I‚Äôm not the vindictive type, but if someone was dancing cuz they caught me like that, I‚Äôd definitely explode their shit too.
---
I visualize you saying this while sitting on a throne made of the broken consoles of the banned.  Hellscape burning behind you.  Banned players moaning in a sea of fire around you....
---
Good point lol need to give them time to bounce back
---
Also in the small shed/shack next to the pumpkin patch across the way
---
Use diluted stims that is what I carry around because 90% of the time I overhear with normal stims.
---
Once I past level 300 I didn't care about levelling up anymore especially since I have a// the new wastelanders gear I want.  In the meantime I made it to level 350 after dbl xp and just go around the map doing events, dropping nukes, helping noobs and wait for the next patch for new content.
---
I just fire up a new toon and go get a level real quick.
---
Sneak, run away, level up, plot revenge, gather instruments of revenge, enact revenge.
---
Yep.  Spam that button for 30 seconds straight it seems like.  Turing in the quest is similar but not quite as bad for me.
---
It also never adds the quest to the corner of screen, need to go into the pip boy and make it active.
---
[Here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_raid) on the wiki shows two cut missions
---
In this Juicehead [video](https://youtu.be/AAvXNFSJ2_g) he talks about the possibility of a new vault opening. New things were added to the vault, as well as its power armor reward. He even shows video of inside the vault. It seems to be a cryo related vault
---
The more cool photos I see like this makes me wanna make a strictly photography character. I go around with groups just making awesome memories.
---
The fast travel cost is just a visual bug. You don‚Äôt actually spend any caps.
---
Did you have fun cheating though? That‚Äôs all that matters. Video games are about fun.
---
the handmade rifle is "magic" somehow, because it does more damage, than any other rifle i had before. one hit kills lv68 super mutants.   
---
i did read into that "magic effect" thing and to work, the weapon has to have a rate of fire around 200. with two-shot it may have such a fire rate.
---
I love the event. It doesn‚Äôt require the prep of a silo and I can run as many as 12 in a single night.
---
He‚Äôs been getting stuck in the air on PS4 as well. I was annoyed when this happened yet again two days ago, I didn‚Äôt think I would survive the jump so I didn‚Äôt try. As I moved around at the base of the lighthouse I saw on my screen press x to commune with the mothman, right where he would be if he had landed. So I moved around until it show on my screen again, hit x and got my bonus. I don‚Äôt know if this will show up on other platforms but it‚Äôs worth a shot if he gets stuck midair.
---
yesterday there were 5 targets and I show up and there were 4 targets then by the time I got to the targets there was 1 fighting a scorchbeast.
---
Reminds me of Kevin Costner's death in Reign of Fire.

Fallout 4 has been ahead of 76 since it launched to steam . It was sporting 10-14k players on at anytime at the start . Yesterday it was closer to 6,700 and 10k peak. Not sure if it was related to the mass ban wave but holy crap if it was.
---
OP, I get where you are coming from and you are right in terms of it being harder to level up the higher you go. 
---
I think, though, that Bethesda's goal is right there in front of us; Bethesda wants us to make new characters. This isn't a particularly bad agenda, but Todd made a comment months back when he first mentions "seasons" that included the idea of a player creating a new character.
---
I just wanted to throw that out there. I don't think people creating new characters and using them for the "lvl up" score is getting around the system, I think it is what Bethesda actually wants us to do.
---
You should be able to significantly lower the volume of voice, ambients, music, etc via the audio controls.
---
Menu, settings, audio.
---
Looks like an alien abduction
---
I would love this. Maybe they could add big speakers to blast music in your camp. Or add the music from new vegas that game had some good music.
---
This. 
---
Window Shopping takes most of my time in Appa.
---
What I've gathered in game is theyre either formerly human or non human with the ability to grasp/manipulate objects, evidenced by their ability to use weapons and the keys and toys we take from them, which hints at possibly being former child workers??but not ghouls or scorched, I think widgets did a video on what little we're actually told about them, my theory is that, like many of the things we aren't given a proper explanation for, is they might be eldritch in origin, like the interloper, the stuff at dunwich borers and the Dulwich building, and the krivbekneh
---
Fast travel bug is the most annoying to me especially since its been around, and complained about, since beta.      
---
No text chat isnt really a bug but its mind boggling how a game like this doesnt have it. Especially when there are events like Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble and Encryptid.      
---
Not sure if this is a bug but the ballistic gutsy can fuck right off, 0 armor or 500 armor doesnt mean shit to them. Along with the Kamehameha Assaultrons, although they are a little easier to dodge and dont travel in packs.       
---
No perk cards or mods against poison is annoying but I see they added some on PTS so ill hold out on complaining about that until it hits live.      
---
Goo/ash piles making faux mobs spawn that can still be VATS targeted, but dont die, is annoying.     
---
This isnt as big of an issue to me personally anymore but, the disappearing/falling legendary corpses can be aggravating.      
---
No fast travel CAMP mat is annoying. If they can fix the fast travel bug, ill gladly be griefed 1/300 times when visiting a CAMP if it means I can arrive at a specific spot. Im tired of being inside foundations, bottom of a cliff, under water, inside a locked room all of which force me to fight the FT bug again.      
---
Also 3rd person free aiming can be really fucked sometimes. Good luck trying to loot some corpse piles in 3rd person, aim about 10 feet from where the actual corpse is. Oh, you think youre aiming over this structure or around this tree with your explosive weapon? Guess again, and enjoy the crippled limbs. This has also been a problem since beta.      
---
VATs is just humorous to me right now more than it is a problem. The % it shows is just a place holder more than anything. I hit just as many 8% shots as I do 95%. Also, if you lock on to an enemy in LoS and they move behind cover you can still shoot through the object and kill them if the VATs is still locked on.      
---
Inventory/crafting lag is a problem but I "fixed" it by removing notes/holotapes. I shouldnt need to do this to fix UI lag but at least there is a "fix" for it.
---
AHAA better sell that plan for 5k then or more
---
‚ÄúSome men just want to watch the world burn‚Äù XD
---
Same here, I carry three shovels, a Bloodied 1\*, Mutants 3\* and a Zealots 3\*, they are kind of fun especially when you hear that thunk sound when you hit something.
---
Some people on this subreddit are kraut of control... Sorry
---
Just run West Tek, have inspirational, and cranberry relish. I level up like 4 times every day I play.
---
Each rank is 150 atoms. I really wanted that fireplace door üòÇ
---
I'm definitely ok with people who screw up the game for others being punished. Possibly a character reset or something equivalent. All out bans however will hurt this game and community in the future. I'm assuming many of the players who were permanently banned were fallout 1st subscribers. This game doesn't charge for their add ons and dlc, it's those subscriptions that help support the production of the game. Hopefully many of the game pass players subscribe to 1st and at least help make up some of that lost revenue.
---
I‚Äôm actually going to save it and give to someone along the line on Xbox. Because I know there are a million people that try and try and never get it and I got lucky to find a guy for 5k when the night before someone wanted 15k and I know that‚Äôs the going price usually.
---
Thank you. I couldn‚Äôt find the roll up door anywhere. And never bothered with the side door. But I‚Äôll give it the roll up door a shot tonight from inside, like you suggested.
---
All the time. The views in this game are so nice that I've found myself taking photos.  Not for quests, just for me.
---
yeah i have that too, been happening on and off since the survival beta, but kicked into overdrive with wastelanders, happening every death for every character. submitted tickets to bugthesda support with no response, its just a pain in the ass that shouldn't be happening.
---
Imagine being a cheater and having the audacity to complain.
---
I don't disagree!
---
Did you miss the double XP weekend?
---
This game is very good at playing the fomo(fear of missing out) card. I'm still mad I missed the Thanksgiving bundle with the display dresser.
---
Ach, geh doch AfD w√§hlen, du Schwalbenhirn.
---
That may have been me on accident. Something similar happened to me at Whitesprings Station and I thought the person at the legendary vending machine was AFK. So, I waved and then they moved so I thought they were done and began using the machine myself. I used it very quickly (just unloaded 2 weapons) but the person was ticked off because apparently they weren‚Äôt AFK. Honest mistake.
---
Yep. I often find myself saying I hate this game, but when there's actually content or things are interesting, I really do enjoy it. However I haven't moved on from it, purely because of the amount of time I've already invested into the game.
---
If I was to log in tomorrow and find my account was deleted/gone forever, I don't if I'd be sad or relieved.
---
Get used to it, the screen freeze or the server crash/boot happens quite often and usually when you are doing something you think is important.  I say that because my wife laughs at me when I curse at the screen.  If she only knew.
---
That's not true. The amount of XP needed goes up every level starting from level 2. Don't go by the wiki. Half the info on there is wrong or outdated.
---
Well Northeast of Freddys fear house on the side of a hill by a cave there are always a pair of honey beasts spitting them out. Stings and things sends you here to find the glands.

Thanks! And thanks for the silver!

Then i can give you some :)

Add me: Assass1n1191

Ohh that‚Äôs chill, on PS4 I usually find them at 10k in players vendors
---
Kill low level human raiders and cultists.  Point pleasant,  Summerville,  etc.
---
They always seem to be carrying them.
---
Pharma farma is good too.
---
Ditto - Bows are fun but fundamentally flawed in the current game design. Their rate of fire is naturally slow but their damage is relatively low when you get right down to it. Hitting a moving target at range with VATS is nearly impossible with a bow right now but not a problem for my handmade or combat rifle? Without solid VATS support they aren't viable in my opinion, I've tried several times over the last several months, going back as far as the original PTS,  and have all the related perks at level three. I really would like them to be useful but bows just aren't competitive in their current implementation.
---
I was playing because I am a fallout fan and was having fun, then I hit the "you have done all the quests so here is a bunch of daily grinding" and my enjoyment waned but I still played because I needed to get settler rep and now the new scoreboard, but then I realized that is kindda pointless if there is still nothing but dailies ahead of me, so now idk what to do. Haven't logged in in about a week, a first since I bought the game.
---
Okay, thanks everyone.  Guess I'm SOL this week ;(
---
I hate the level up one, been doing it on my level 14 alt on the days when I'm not feeling it, which has been at least 10 days so far since the run started. 
---
Could we at least drop the level up one to 250 score and make one of the other random adventure ones the 500 score one each day? That way we have one special one to do first and then work our way down the list and not feel bad if we skip the level up.
---
Good trap camps that actually kill you in a smart way? Well they deserve my junk. But the low effort punji board cunts putting them on top of you? They will be killed over and over and their camps destroyed. Good reason for sneak + Chinese Stealth armor + light footed.
---
Frog legs perk card
---
I found a trap camp only once, I fast traveled to it and lagged to the top floor where he was controlling it. I was able to troll him by constantly triggering his traps before anyone got caught in it. I really pissed him off as he was trying to kill me with the boards but I had the perk that prevents me from getting hurt by them when sneaking. I kept him busy for about an hour before he just up and left the server lol
---
You randomly take damage when you lose a health buff like well fed, or any food/chems you took that give you increased health. Its stupid the way your character reacts to it when its lost, but yea thats why your character will randomly take damage.
---
IMO blocker is not needed for ranged builds, especially if you're sneaking.  99% of the time, nothing gets within melee range.
---
Incredible, looks agreed.
---
All of this. That‚Äôs how I feel. I‚Äôve gotten this far. Why stop. As much as it limits me in other areas. But yeah my account getting trashed would ultimately free me lol. I would definitely not put the effort into restarting.
---
I've found solice on using the photomode. Ive been writing stories to put with them, but too nervous to post them üòÜ

That mothman was a paid actor
---
You're not wrong in that aspect, i can't say I've honestly thought of it in that light.
---
So i dont getthe damage buff for psycho and the damage resist for med-x?
---
Habit, yes. Addiction, no.
---
Haha I love it when it‚Äôs there. As for Ward üî´üî´üî´ü§Ø
---
Much appreciated. I won‚Äôt be on today until after 4 pm est. Won‚Äôt be on again until the weekend though. If you could hold those until I can get them, it‚Äôd be much appreciated.
---
Edit: words are hard
---
I am the same way and as such when I build camps I make sure the vendors are easily accessible and in plain view so people know im not about about that sort of bs.
---
Closer to 3000 than 2000, because of the friends I‚Äôve made and the gameplay loop is relaxing and low key so good to unwind after work.  It sure as hell isn‚Äôt because of the awesome job Bethesda does on the game or their outstanding customer service.
---
I am for sure in a winding down phase, as happens from time to time.  I was really looking forward to legendary characters... a year ago.  Now gaining more power for my characters is frankly useless, I‚Äôm not afraid of anything in the game, and I only die when not paying attention because death doesn‚Äôt matter anyway.  Likely this is a good thing as it meant I didn‚Äôt feel the need to dive into the most recent duping rounds.
---
I love camp building but I‚Äôve now got 3/5 camps that are at a ‚Äúnever move‚Äù point, and 2 I really like so that part of the game is now limited as well.
---
You gave him ammo to shoot you. I think I need to worship you a little.
---
I had on lovers embrace and popped a lunchbox, went to four fissure sites and couldn‚Äôt get there. When I went to west tek, everything was dead outside so I didn‚Äôt bother going inside.
---
&gt; Mashing tab to exit vats to suddenly end up in your pip boy isn't fun. 
---
The amount of times I yell in rage in a single night over this... I trained myself to use tab as an exit function for this game and then it punishes me like that. And then you press esc because tab didn't work or you're afraid your panicked tab-tapping will register twice bringing you back to the same pipboy screen -- and it brings up the map x.x Layers of UI hell for PC. I haven't managed to train myself to "q" back out to where I can do it in a stressful situation ... maybe in another two years the muscle memory will set in.
---
I need it but it‚Äôs gone in an hour. Will it ever come back?
---
you got bird bones mutation?
---
huh.  where to find the flamethrower trap plans...???
---
Just get an explosive variant and you wont ever worry about accuracy ever again.
---
Well done sir (or ma‚Äôam)
---
Oh for sure. If my game was deleted, I'd probably be pretty upset, but I definitely wouldn't start again. I'd delete the game off my PS4, say my goodbyes to my guild and I think even after a week I'd be happier and relieved that it happened.
---
Isn't it crazy how we can know/think this, but yet we still play the game? Truly an addiction.
---
*Assaultron has joined the chat*
---
Yep. Not able to play it on weekends.
---
I did that recently but it wasn‚Äôt a trap camp as such. He placed them after while I used his vendor. Made me sooo mad and would never normally do that. Well worth the 20 minutes looking for meat to make them.
---
Lvl 70 nw player here, at first I didnt realize it was a battle royale deal. Im glad i gave it a go during the survivor challenges, and now I play it 90% of the time. Nothing like the adrenaline of the last 10 players duking it out with a extra crispy scorchbeast breathing down your neck. Yes you have your cheaters, but honestly run into aimbotters in cod warzone as well.
---
I really think they should've left vault 94. Those raids were hard AF and I enjoyed having to have perfect coordination. Now im like you I just pretty much perfected my PA build so death went out the window. I will still love the legendary perks just to be able to shed the pick lock though
---
Yeah that's one Sauer Kraut
---
An easy solution would be making group owned workshops. The one that claimed it would still be primary owner in case ppl left the group, but those that wanted to be part of pvp could opt in to co-owning the workshop and their name would also appear on the workshop. Allowing the defender to defend with a team and the attackers to inow if theyre fighting a team.
---
Edit:typos
---
Some people just want to burn the world down. 
---
Well done.
---
Should have waited until near the end tbh
---
I got a spare disease cure you can have...lol. But that‚Äôs what you get for ‚Äúromancing‚Äù a scorched!
---
I was glad when I reached the maximum rep range, because I will never work for him again xD
---
That‚Äôs a good idea! Where does he set up shop? *edit* and when is meat week?
---
I mean you can take over the canned food workshop and make some.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Great work!
---
The only 3* I have left is a Junkies with 40% faster swing rate (awesome!) and weight reduction (really?). So on my melee character that means it weighs in at a whopping 0.24 lbs.
---
It's going to be my go to for low level areas I think...even though he's an unarmed character with a deathclaw gauntlet, with mutations etc. etc. he's still pretty good with any melee weapon and like you say, how can you not love the thunk.
---
I'll be a long time just trying to find good melee weapons, but at least the gauntlet I've got (1* instigating) is good enough for now.
---
So who stole your junk that made you so butt hurt?
---
What does catching up to zorbo even do?
---
It's incredibly sad that game monetization has boiled down to "What is the best way to psychologically exploit our entire player base?"
---
There are games out there that use one or two of these tricks, but Bethesda is actively trying to use every last one in the book, and I'm incredibly sorry for everyone who gets hooked by it.
---
Honestly this is no different than the subliminal messages that were, at one point, a hugely successful method of marketing in movie theaters. The fact that that was banned pretty much everywhere, and this psychological game exploitation is not, is an example of just what a shit show the gaming industry is right now. Keep in mind that game studios employ psycholists for this exact reason, and I can't even begin to explain how wrong that is.
---
Waiting until the end is much more efficient though, even if you feel 'behind' it makes more sense to pay for the ranks later than now.
---
Si papi
---
Is that in the main place or the bunker? I haven‚Äôt progressed far in the story yet.
---
Those are ideas, but they gotta do that too.
---
"I'm so *not*-angry that I'm going to tab out of my game to post on the internet about how *not*-angry I am. That'll show those no-good trap camp wannabes how *not*-angry I am!"
---
Agreed. Just felt a personal need to catch up to Zorbo
---
Thats badass man I hope everything goes smooth for them!
---
Use to do this when running rifle build...VATS would do that back then, too. Still gets stupid sometimes with about any gun or build...so it is a handy technique.
---
Yea I agree, I can‚Äôt believe they reverted back to pre-patch and three star bosses are again dropping one star walking canes. And the ultracite PA plans are still in the Queen‚Äôs loot pool lmao, why stop there, include plans for workbenches too. 
---
Out of hundreds of SBQ battles I‚Äôve only encountered once when someone immediately killed the queen as soon as she spawned, it was quite a while ago so it was probably melee+stacked bobbleheads etc. The ‚Äòmagic‚Äô weapons can do her fast but not ‚Äòthat‚Äô fast because the damage has to be continuously built up, if she keeps moving around or won‚Äôt land, it‚Äôs very difficult to do.
---
I run 2 pieces of -50% fall damage . jumping f the big bridge or any montain is something i  enjoy
---
&gt; I can get atoms through other challenges
---
Good luck with that. Since SCORE has been added there are reports across the board that the atoms are not paid out.
---
I really love the camp building as well.  Seems like there isn‚Äôt much effort from some tho...I go vender hopping and get disappointed when the camp is just crappy box with vendors carelessly thrown out front.  
---
I even laugh at the trap ones that drop me off a cliff when I go to the last vendor. üòÇ
---
If you get to the end before Zorbo I get the grand prize basket at the end of the board
---
That‚Äôs a great idea, made better by the fact that there is indeed still a wood hardpoint right next to the factory!
---
Pick a number between 1 and 20 and I‚Äôll give it to the person closest.
---
Tormenter is ok, if you are a rifle build, dont take stagger perks like tank killer perk and dont hit on the head. I know, it does 2x more damage in the head, but that makes her stagger and cancels its land animation.
---
Cancel culture took every last breath out of this game
---
Just the main hotel area.
---
Hahaha man you sound salty af
---
Shotguns shooting salt outside VATS and the impossibility to share stash among my characters, which exist in the same universe.
---
Oh damn, I wonder if this was me, I literally did a mothman jump about four hours ago -- what was the player wearing?
---
Reply with he gt and a number between 1 and 20 and I‚Äôll pick the closest.
---
How long does it take to fill up? Thanks!
---
Mhm? No, no junk lost. Just irritation that some ignorant lazy little shit thinks pulling the floor out makes his camp a ‚Äútrap‚Äù camp ‚Äúhur dur got you‚Äù
---
Oh, I thought you got that just for getting to 100
---
Explosive bait their camp ez solution. Ain for vendors, generators and decom showers, also display cases as chance to glitch and delete their items gl
---
This was about a month ago
---
You know. Trap camps don‚Äôt bother me. I get your frustration. I get why it bothers people.
---
But maybe it‚Äôs also because someone got one over on you?
---
What's wrong with the waterwheel? Just saw a camp with three rotating waterwheels which seemed to work just fine.
---
Pick a number between 1 and 20 and I‚Äôll pick the closest.
---
If they made you upsetti enough to make this post, I think their trap worked.
---
For dailies and weeklies, yes. There are survival, world and social options. Go take 20 pictures in the mire, or kill a bunch of specific robots
---

---
I only do the Endurance Team so no one ever joins me :,(
---
Idk what it is but it 100% works on Scorchbeasts and any Legendary I use it on. Kinda iffy on normal enemies.
---
Vendors out in the open or accessible is great, and for strictly buying purposes it works well. I do the same. 
---
But some people like to lean into the whole camp and role play thing and I respect that, so by far the biggest warning sign for me is the lack of stash boxes or scrap boxes. 
---
To me if you don‚Äôt have them in the form of actual decor objects, cases or whatever even besides the dedicated ones, then that‚Äôs a huge red flag because then it feels like you‚Äôre purposefully inconveniencing yourself for a reason. 
---
And that reason screams to me you don‚Äôt want people to be able to drop off junk they may have on them easily. 
---
Sometimes I may be wrong, but I‚Äôd rather be wrong and keep my stuff and not have to nuke their camp than the alternative. 
---
Also thanks for your service regarding your vendors, when I just wanna stock hop sometimes.
---
Yes, exactly. I know the legendary perk card will negate swapping out lock pick/hacker. But then you have all the other non combat perks you constantly have to swap out.
---
The introduction of Public Groups made this a lot more tolerable as it allows you to rejoin the group you were a part of, as long as it isn't the entire server that's shitting the bed.
---
But yeah, if you are out there on your own, it sucks massive balls.
---
Ach shit, ich dachte der ‚Äúeula vor kauf gedanke‚Äú waere auf tos uebertragbar. Naja, dann muss ich mich damit zufrieden geben bethesda zu boykottieren.
---
I can confirm, tamed a deathclaw this morning with animal friend only. I had a cat but the stupid ass got killed and disappeared.
---
At L217, I know what you mean -  I only get the level up one about once every 3 days or so.
---
That said, with the current number of dailys, not getting the level up every day is not necessarily a big deal (Score-wise, anyway)
---
Weeklys are worth what, 1000 score?  Given there are at least 5 of them - that‚Äôll get you at least 2 score levels.
---
  Although I don‚Äôt level up every day, and I don‚Äôt do the NW one...3-4 weeks into a 10 week run.... I‚Äòve managed to make it to... - the SSQ plushie was the last award I received - I think that‚Äôs close to 40.
---
Sadly that's how this community is. Wastelanders wasn't even anything amazing with its very safe and generic characters and writing, but it's better than nothing so it's fine. We're kinda forced to not criticize anything because yeah it IS at least something.
---
Come to my camp and buy your fill of chems!
---
free violence.
---
Most of them are obvious. Store your junk or skip sketchy camps with "USE THIS" in giant neon letters
---
Every review I read before and during download made me believe I was downloading an unplayable mess. No part of my experience so far has matched up to all the shit posting I saw online about it. Just my thought though.

Ol‚Äô Ward still hasn‚Äôt gotten over his hypersomnia since the last patch. The mofo supposed to be at his desk, but I still find that lazy bastard taking an afternoon cat nap in his bed.
---
Guy migjt be low int build and gets piss exp
---
I don't believe in luck or fate or any of that.
---
Separate question for everybody else. Visited a camp one time and saw clearly posted ‚Äòstay away signs.‚Äô Figured it was coming, dropped the scrap and took my chances. Whole
---
Place was creepy as hell. Toured lower area vendors and on my way out while staring at the last vendor for quite awhile, suddenly dead and contracted a disease. No idea what cause of death was, but hey, I was warned. Any insights?
---
Oh haha mine was literally right before you posted, didn't realize anyone else did this
---
This is not working for me, any idea why?
---
I'm sure overpriced cosmetics is the least of their worries.
---
plus the service rifle skin is only coming with patch 21 or 22 so whatever.
---
Try server hopping as it does have it there sometimes.
---
Yeah you might have a case of idiot syndrome
---
&gt;Why does the game load the whole map BEFORE it tells you that your camp can't be placed?
---
pretty much that.
---
Also, not really FO76 related but I play this sometimes while watching a stream on the computer. This streamer plays Overwatch and onee character has a beeping sound very similar to suicide Supermutants. Scares me every single time
---
So for me, if I trigger VATS, then try a quick shot with a Gauss, it misses. But if I charge the shot, it hits.
---
ehrm... no. Dailies and weeklies only give SCORE (and those autocomplete).
---
I am talking about the other changes, those that should give atoms.
---
They know bout this and wont fix it just like the autocomplete and perks. It is what it is
---
Ich bin kein deutscher, ich h√§tte nichts von nem neuen nazi deutschland, aber dein einseitiges denken und deine Unh√∂flichkeit w√ºrden schon eher zu soner wahlentscheidung passen.
---
Is there something unique about the explosive bait that doesn't put a bounty on you? Or was it just worth the bounty, in this instance?
---
Nothing uses full data- not even the census because not everyone responds. 2 million is more than enough when comparing percentages- one person affects 0.000001 % with 2 million people as a base
---
They showed us all the rewards we could get and the timeframe we had to earn them. Adding anything past that, would feel like theyre rewarding extra stuff to tho that pay for it early. Getting it early IS your reward for buying them. This was meant to be a free seasonal reward system to lessen the amount of atoms given freely in the economy and to give players something to progress slowly towards to keep player count up with daily logins.
---
As a junkie I havnt popped a chem since getting addicted
---
The *animation* fix is coming with 21. The skin has been out for like 2-3 weeks now.
---
I didn't bother with the 1st method but the 2nd worked with chest of drawers. I just had to find a place around my camp where items sink slightly into the ground.
---
What I meant to say was "gause"shotgun sry for the confusion.. figured people would put two an two together lol.. I'll fix it now
---
That dead body is one of a number of spawns that includes the skeleton, the witch, the Civil War Re-enactor, lemonade Handy, etc.
---
There are a number of documented spawn points - the dry lake bed has two, there‚Äôs one near the Overseer‚Äôs camp, couple in the Mire, etc.
---
If you like plans, it‚Äôs a fun thing to keep an eye out for.
---
Agreed, looks incredible.
---
Yeah, I was putting the last mainframe part last year.  Shit, need to tinker that shit out.  Climb out of my PA.  Game locks, back when that was a bug.
---
I was soloing it so it was like 1.5 hours into the damn thing.  
---
I didn't play for about 4 or 5 months after that.  Was so pissed.  But I came back later and finished it up with a buddy.  Launch Successful!
---
I don‚Äôt carry junk when I shop camps. This is more or less extreme sarcasm at how stupid some of these guys are.
---
I think its a very useful perk outside of combat. The jumping and shooting might throw a few people off but most people seem to expect it. It really helps with moving around the map and ambushing people from unexpected rooftops and cliffs.
---
the fucking stutters, man. i just cant deal with the clunkiness as a whole. Im playing on an Xbox One X and the game has a seizure and takes a shit when opening my map or pipboy. I scroll through my inventory and the Legendary Run map in slow motion at 2 FPS. i have to spam the stimpack button several times to use one when in combat. sometimes opening my weapon wheel in combat causes me to freeze. just to name a few things.
---
I think this game is great, and i love it, but these issues really fuck up the experience for me.
---
Really nice
---
That‚Äôs what I meant. I haven‚Äôt had any problems getting atoms from the other categories
---
Dude. What is it with you? Move on. I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt care what you think.
---
Why do the super high level players always have the classiest names?
---
No sweat.  Work interferes soo much with playtime :)  
---
  I know the T60 stuff I have is in my stash or carry inventory, not in the machine, so no worries.
---
How many people got scared away from the vault raid because of the disappearing gear rumor and all around buggy-ness?  It wasn‚Äôt enough that I was willing to give it another shot, my friends at the time either noped out of the vault raid or the game entirely by that point.  A shame too because I did want to run the content, Bethesda just shot themselves in the foot on this one.
---
Huh... I haven't seen it since I got disconnected while conduiting. I'll keep an eye out!
---
What is your build if you don't mind me asking?
---
Doubt it
---
Its cool. I was just cracking a joke as is.
---
How bad the view distance is and how bad the buildings look at a distance now.
---
Todd is an enabler!
---
I just did some experimentation, it's not 100% like I thought.  buffout, bufftats overrode each other.  But Fury could stack.  Psycho would override Fury and vice versa.
---
Berry Mentats seems like it's off in it's own little world and stacks with everything.
---
But for most of the drugs they seem to share the same 'slot' so no psycho + med-x.
---
Yep,possibly the worst use of atoms so far.
---
Lots of PA spawn points in Watoga, mostly on the rooftops. 45, 51, and 60 can all appear.
---
Edit: food point about Wastelanders, not sure if any of these have changed
---
Mentats int plus 2, berry mentats int plus 5
---
Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve heard of that before. Remember what the disease was?
---
Incredible looks, agreed.
---
Yeah man its pretty frustrating. And it helps a lot now that i know the  work around. Bethesda should really fix this since its such a old bug. But hey they still havent so im not putting my hopes up lol
---
Yes but carry lots of stims..you will be walking around crippled half the time....also explosive shotguns are weak in VATS.
---
 However, if you are using a non VATS playstyle, I agree...they are the best option...even more so- if you stack a couple of Demo cards. (Just watch point blank range..u can go from crippling yourself to killing yourself pretty quick).
---
308 crafts in stacks of like... 20?  50cal (and 5mm) craft in stacks of 100. The ratios get a little better when you‚Äôre crafting Ultracite ammo, but then you have to farm flux...
---
5mm is also fairly common in the world (Supermutants with Miniguns drop 100; ammo cans usually have 30ish). 50cal is hella rare in the world. 308 drops fairly often, but only in stacks of 1-5.
---
there are at least 2 more variants. in my opinion the screeching eagle is the ugliest of the bunch.
---
and I was actually talking about the other rifle skin.
---
&gt; muss ich mich damit zufrieden geben bethesda zu boykottieren
---
Ich denke nicht das du da eine Wahl hast, Beth ist dir zuvorgekommen und boykottiert dich.
---
Awesome ill try this too!
---
The lack of foresight, dedication and planning from the developers ar bethesda to make this a good fallout game. The qol of many things is garbage. My perks dont work, there are undying mobs, respawning doesnt work, fast travelling doesnt work, endurance means nothing on armor, people getting lunchbox gift, the terrible trade ui, the ammo ui, how they embrace the idea of quantity gameplay and not quality oh and finally, instead of fixing any of these well known, documented problems, they ban a 1/3rd of their active player base and 1/5th of their fo1st membership. Top tier company micro and macro management.
---
next they need outfit loadouts. it makes zero sense that i have to re-equip my outfit, mask, underarmor, and armor pieces every time i want to use the stealth suit. at the very least it should revert you to the last equipped items when you remove an article that removed other pieces when applied.
---
Agreed, looks inedible
---
Yeah I'm level 346 atm. And level 1600 is just crazy to need to max your 6 cards. I could see maybe level 500 to have them maxed, and that's a big giant maybe. 99% of players will never even hit the level 300 mark. Let alone any higher
---
So that is because somebody probably ran the outside on that world recently. I will link you the best post I found on getting xp. When all the enemies in an area are dead, that is because somebody on that world ran it recently. just quit the world, relog in, and make sure to join a team agin and go check again. Here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hpbuzi/my_ultimate_guide_for_xp_gainranking_up_in/
---
Can‚Äôt remember, some time ago. Just assuming it wasn‚Äôt floor boards. Death was as freaky as the camp. I appreciated that.
---
Still v rare on pc
---
I forgot about phantom suiciders in FO76. Sometimes when I FT to Huntersville, and it happens only there, I can hear the beeps but there is no Suicider anywhere.
---
Yeah I had it happen once. I was heading to the mire and it took me to the ash heap. I just put it down to my mind being elsewhere and doing it without realising, but apparently not. 
---
Nothing better than clicking 6 times to fast travel at all, then ending up 45 caps and another loading screen away from where you wanted to be eh üòÅ
---
Hmm thats wild I never heard of that one? What was happening?
---
Gauss shotgun doesnt do that any longer....fixed with last update. Honestly, was cooler when it did.
---
And yes, regenerating enemies are consistent....I always like to imagine I have come across one that is mutated or carries tons of stims. It helps the stress a little.
---
Lunch boxes last an hour, and you can log in and out and the effect stays on. Lover's embrace I believe you will need to re-apply each time you log in.
---
I‚Äôm sure a lot of this is the basis of video game addiction being considered a real disease these days. I‚Äôm not on that level by any means but these behaviors on a grander scale...yeah I can see why help might be needed. If push came to shove I could quit outright. My issue is more of me spending most of my available play time doing the same tasks over and over on one game that hates me in actuality.
---
I have loved this game since Beta all through the good and bad.. I use this game as pure escapism as my reality isn‚Äôt exactly living the dream.. Am I addicted, I definately look forward to logging on üòÄüëçüèºüëçüèº
---
I'll keep checking, thanks!
---
It doesn't put a bounty on you. And it deals damage regaedless of being hostile with someone or not.
---
I do it on private worlds. Not much point in public when people beat you to the ghouls.
---
He didn't sleep this time. He was glitched under his trailer looking confused
---
They did tho, and it is. And it worked. And you're salty. 
---
It sounds like an effective base.
---
Naja ich k√∂nnte mir ja noch ein paar skyrim special editions kaufen
---
I know I could have switched to a private server ( I try not too bc I hope I get a server doing scorched earth) but my limited play time I don‚Äôt bother trying to do that. I get maybe an hour or two to play every night. You‚Äôd think that‚Äôs a lot until every load screen takes two minutes or I die or something else dumb happens.  Servers been a little janky the past few days for me. 
---
Appreciate the link! üëçüèª
---
have on rep to go through after that i'm finally happy i can ignore their quest
---
Damn Rad herpes
---
Yeah, that shit owns. It's as if FT craps out and the Nukashine code takes over.
---
I think people are just launching less nukes in general atm. The ban hammer hit the high level player base pretty hard, as well as all the game pass players further diluting the remaining high levels in a world.
---
Also the previous dupe let people dupe tons of flux, so many people don't need to farm it anymore
---
I did this not long after the game launched and the asshole players would attack my camp instead of using it. They leveled my camp about 3 or 4 times before I finally said forget it and moved the camp. With the way the system works now it wouldn't seem to be a problem. Maybe I'll try this again on an alt toon.
---
And I agree with your post 100%. Game has no content: I'm drowning in content lost af. It's pay to win: lotta free atoms prob buy game after game pass. Nuclear Winter sucks and is all hackers: Ah, these kids in final circle just had a good run, power armour, and a skill gap a mile over my head.
---
Could have been a game bug, I‚Äôll be wandering alone and randomly take damage for no reason. Depending on the camp construction they could have hidden some trap in the floor too, dunno.
---
Looks incredible, Agreed.
---
Shame we cannot fire Ward from his "job"
---
Bro you wanna talk over priced lmao go play valorant or seige
---
Even if the new atoms add correctly to the steam account now, I can't access all the atoms I have on the Bethesda account because I have never played on a Bethesda account, only steam. If I try to download from the bethesda launcher I can't, the only option I have is "Buy now".
---
So I have 1k atoms sitting on an account I can't log in and I don't know how to fix this. And no, the " bSteamEnabled=0" don't work for me.
---
Any ideas?
---
One of the many acknowledged but no addressed glitches in the game
---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights.
---
As for how to do it, just keep grinding levels and moving points around. It's a pain but it's the only way
---
Hahah why was it cooler for you?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be happy with just firing him.
---
they have same stats each tome, you are eatting different mentats?
---
Census violence if you will
---
Why'd high levels get banned?
---
I completely forgot about light footed.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure Zorbo is just there to give you an idea of how much time is left. Once you hit 100, you unlock that final bundle
---
Is there any fix? I really don't have the kind of income to spend on atomic points rn, and like I said, I prefer grinding for them. I don't really want to keep grinding only to lose all my progress.
---
This is me! I've never considered myself a completionist by any means, but The Legendary Run has me caught up on making sure I get all of my dailies done every day. There have been days I've been worn out, but can't fall asleep until I get the challenges done.
---
Yeah precisely why I don‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt even go there really if someone else does. When you‚Äôre high level and your build is done there‚Äôs only really enough for a circuit for one, otherwise it‚Äôs a waste of time and resources for me really. 
---
Another reason is that I don‚Äôt really enjoy nuke zones at all anymore because they mean I have to remove my unyielding set and lose all my special bonuses. Not ideal when you‚Äôre trying to stack int or rely on strength for melee or carry weight. 
---
I and I guess a lot of people prefer to nuke the queen and stay outside the zone and not compromise builds.
---
The two are in no way mutually exclusive ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
In these times, americans fought against german nonsense. :)
---
For your seriuos question: ive paid for the game. They have my money.
---
Truth is they dont care what any of us think, dupers or non dupers lmao
---
Mir ist deine Nationalit√§t egal, aber deine Dreistigkeit ist nicht zu √ºberbieten. Bescheissen und dann klagen?
---
Comforting moo.
---
The latter unfortunately. Though I did see a post sometime ago about wanting a raider collectron and it became a thing sooo make of that what you will.
---
This... fought the queen yesterday in the blast zone because someone dropped it too far north. Bloodied is much harder with constant rads.
---
Post Nukashine blacked out romp in the mire..woke up with a severe limp, a Ghoul slayers gamma gun, and a party hat.
---
I have occasionally but atm running silos is a low priority and on the odd occasion I do the SBQ has first call. Also with many noobs Nuking for the first time Fissure Prime gets targeted for quest closure.
---
If I‚Äôm nuking that spot, I‚Äôm doing on a private world with only me and my friends. Not letting a bunch of randoms get the glowing ones that *my* nuke created before I do.
---
They claim to read it as much as the actual Bethesda forum.   Whether or not that translates into something actionable is another story.
---
Todd doesn't l, buy skyrim on ps5.
---
if escape artist is the problem then they probably reverted the previous fix and broke invisibility. **again**.
---
Glitches exploiten ist kein beschiss. Wen hab ich denn beschissen, jeder der in fo76 handelt kennt mich als fairen gesch√§ftspartner.
---
You mean the dupers that used a mule account and haven‚Äôt been impacted at all by the ban wave?  They‚Äôre still around in force, Bethesda isn‚Äôt able to touch those dupers as they don‚Äôt do hardware bans. 
---
Those are the actual dupers that Bethesda would love to get rid of as well.  I know all too many players turn into trained seals clapping and barking away when they hear of a ban wave, but the most recent ban wave is more about PR than impact.  A harsh come-down on the player base that is based upon...Bethesda‚Äôs code finding dupers.  That‚Äôs the laugh line folks, I‚Äôm outta here.
---
No I have not been banned or suspended.
---
Atomic points? You mean atoms...?
---
It was a visual glitch for me when i got it but i heardsome people actually lost them. thet say send a ticket but i am doubtful and they maybe respond to 1/40 tickets with a bot response. Just learn to play around it, been having fast travel glitch for 200+ levels
---
Instead of counting sheep we are the sheep lol.
---
Commando and Rifleman really shouldn‚Äôt need SPECIAL changes, just perk card swaps. I guess it depends on exactly how you build though.
---
He ain‚Äôt quite right.
---
Shiit. I rememer in NV and 3 you could take like 20 chems and become an unstoppable god for a few minutes.
---
Yeah. My bad. Still I keep missing them
---
A lot of them were duping, anyone could have done it. It just stands to reason that more high levels would be doing it since they'd have the gear worth duping
---
Absolutely. None of the defensive perks are not worth it if you are ranged and experienced player. But since OP seem not to be that experienced it is most likely very beneficial for him to be using it.
---
Thanks for the update dude, great post +karma
---
I farm glowing blood there to sell at the vendor for the caps, but never gonna drop a nuke there too many players for too little ghouls.
---
If you are on a public team and crash to desktop; you should have the open to rejoin team when you restart game. You should still own your workshop.
---
The only time ive ever heard them listening to community was with ammo convertor but havent heard anything since so probably just a pr i care
---
Nat√ºrlich ist das Beschiss, jeder mit nem IQ √ºber 2 hat genug Verstand, um zu wissen, dass er da auf ganz d√ºnnes Eis tritt.
---
I can't shake these nightmares... floating in space forever... just, why?
---
When it comes to the Legendary Run, doing silos isn't that "lucrative" for XP, and if you're going to nuke Whitesprings, you want to make sure you get the reward from it, not a bunch of schmucks who selfishly clear everything out before you even get there.
---
That's a huge issue then. I've never noticed this but does it happen only with earned atoms or does it happen with ones you buy as well? If you can lose bought atoms that's basically Bethesda stealing from you...
---
Nothing with bethesda is ever really fixed
---
Ja mit nem iq auf 2er ebene kennst du dich sicher gut aus.
---
The last two times I nuked whitespring in public my game crashed/grinded/locked after I get past a couple of cottages on the way in. Forget that noise. Waste of a keycard for me.
---
It never ends.
---
they could add a lot of things to make this game better but they wont cause their undedicated and lack the planning but yes, i like this idea also, gives a point to farming legendaries
---
not to mention jumping out and back in to respawned ghouls for about two straight hours. Not a difficult decision.
---
Nat√ºrlich, denn online hat man mit Deppen wie Euch jeden Tag zu tun. Aber hey, wenn du bekommst, was du verdienst, habe ich daf√ºr nur Schadenfreude √ºbrig ;)
---
Agreed, incredible looks.
---
do you have a chameleon piece of armor?
---
Zorbo never can reach rank100. When he would move there, your time would be up.
---
"If I launch this nuke he better not leave."
---
Only the dailies double, not the weeklies.
---
Hmmm, what did that NPC say? I wish my Brahman had twice as many udders then heads? Yeah, that's it. Mooooo....
---
I don't think they think of us as sheep.
---
Cats maybe.  As in herding cats.  Fickle, prone to irrational and sudden acts of violence one moment, purring snuggling furry cute creatures the next, then scratching hissing monsters in 30 seconds.
---
But sheep? Nah..... or should I say bah.
---
As its very much a 'Fan' (in the loosest sense at times) forum I suspect many people expect far too much official Beth input. But if they have any sense they do monitor the larger sites for user feedback and just occasionally act on the better ideas.
---
As far as I know it's limited on the dailies, not sure tho
---
I would settle with playing music from my own source that's strictly client side.
---
In fallout 4, I had a mod for custom halotapes. I had a few songs on standby for fights and what not
---
I've got one that is pretty sizable but is fairly full, you have to look at how many turrets they have too. If there us a big building and a lot of turrets its probably empty, if there is a big building but no turrets or just a few turrets it might be filled. Just depends.
---
I've noticed turrets, garden plants, some lights, and display cases eat budget up pretty fast. If you place a lot of static non functional items camps fill out a lot better.
---
One of the worst items for budget imo is the large welcome to WV sign. I was amazed at how much stuff I had to delete to place it.
---
Ofcourse if you run into a building that is 3 story building that is 6 by 6 or something like that, yeah it's probably empty. Lll
---
I don't even know what their nickname mean :D
---
Sei dir geg√∂nnt, scheint ja sonst nicht viel erfreuliches in deinem kleinen missg√ºnstigen leben zu geben.
---
The pandemic shoppers have hit Appalachia.Where can I find these guys? I would enjoy a good Wasteland fist fight.
---
Well that‚Äôs the issue, people said their inventory got wiped in the vault raid, Bethesda says nothing, and based on ones experience with Bethesda and how they do bugs and customer service, you either suck it up and take the risk, or figure your gear could all be gone and you‚Äôll never get it back.  I mean, if you said that about an old Blizzard game, nobody would believe you.  You say that about Bethesda...
---
I was willing to risk it (was running the raid in PA, so my weapon was only risk) but others?  I can only speak anecdotally but of the people I knew willing to give the buggy raid a chance in the first place, this killed the interest totally.
---
It needs some sort of instanced-interior player home. Like an abandoned apartment you can find once you finish the Mayor quest. Just a small apartment with a bed, stash, scrapbox, one workbench and a cooking station. 
---
As is the whole quest is pointless because there's very little reason to ever be in Watoga. It's just a convenience really.
---
Ah, Bethesda usability.
---
Probably both. I see them look at a few things and claim to pass it on to the dev team, however they are usually really big issues or small easy fixes. I have had one actually respond to a bug report I had but only to claim that it wasn't a thing or it doesn't happen. This was PA headlamps pointing to the right with certain skins. Long story short, it's still an issue.
---
Baaaaa
---
What about the game is 'Pay to Win'?
---
Interesting, if true it will be worth waiting. There's at least 10 ranks instead of 5 you could gain roughly doing it at weekend. I'll edge all them up to completion so I can quickly complete them.
---
Haha ok
---
Well played Bethesda.
---
Guess we couldn't outsmart them on this one.
---
Start up a low level character and do the level up challenges on that one when needed.
---
Nuclear Winter, and sometimes building or whatever new (non-grindy) content is available
---
It‚Äôs a good idea but a lot of those challenges are harder to NOT complete than they are to complete.
---
Edit: And I don‚Äôt think the weeklies will count.
---
Yeah its ONLY for daily challenges.
---
As a 5 time addicted junkie, I only use berry mentats to sell things to npc vendors. I do not use other chems.
---
Yeh expect even more gamepass noobs to join. Most people think ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù with low expectations and are surprised. It‚Äôs a solid game nowadays
---
Same thing over here I am starting to get bored from the game and trying to get score as much as possible.
---
I totally agree with that, I remember losing my B2525 pipe bolt. I was heartbroken when they didn't help me recover.
---
This would also seemingly free up some server memory increasing stability. So many people hold on to garbage just waiting to get scrip for it. Makes no sense not to allow us to get more scrip, but limit the daily turn in.
---
Following the debacle of the auto complete challenges I believe they SHOULD have included the weeklies, but what I believe does not matter.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty good shot!
---
You‚Äôre arguing with people on the internet, bud, and expecting them to put effort into trivial responses. And your original comment shows you didn‚Äôt even understand the basis of my post to begin with.
---
I recently started nuclear winter and holy shit it is pretty fun
---
Grape mentats for selling. So you don't pop any chems to do boss fights?
---
Hopefully I just have the visual bug
---
I just ignored the quest marker, found the terminal, and logged in
---
Any type of team. I always run in Builder teams for the Int and all around XP boost.
---
Ahh, I am pretty happy just turning the Brahmin into BBQ after the event.
---
Try talking to and selling an item to Duchess before you go to see Smiley. Fixed it for me.
---
Thought so, thanks
---
It's a tie between the cranberry bog and the mire for me
---
yup me too
---
Baaa raahh ram baah raahh ram
---
I've seen one example of it where people have had it happen to payed for atoms. But I didn't see if they patched it or if that user found a fix, that exsample was early on in 76s day.
---
Ops, yeah, I ment grape, not berry.
---
No, I dont use any other chems, I know they gives benefits, but I am too lazy to pop them.
---
:D
---
ah, OK. I guess I can pop the ones I like from time to time, but I don't have to worry about staying addicted, just need to avoid addictol.
---
This never happens to me accept in the Rusty Pick. It‚Äôs like every time I access the legendary machine, it‚Äôs whack whack.
---
There's a massive shallow pond south of cranberry bog. The Appalachia River goes to the edges of the entire game square. A friend an I did this yesterday. We went to every literal corner of the map, the corner an point before you start to sink into the ground as it's not physically rendered in anymore. If you try to go past the render point, the game will eventually sling shot you to the end of the game square and disconnect you from server.
---
Your life sounds miserable. You know there's that saying about how if you go out one day and run into an asshole, you ran into an asshole, but if you go out and *everyone* you run into is an asshole, well...
---
Lol in ark you‚Äôd hear ‚Äúalright I‚Äôm going to raid you now and kill all your dinos‚Äù
---
True, then same question is posed for their forum
---
I often go around 2 or 3 times because of the rush of the first few minutes. But atm that's a lot of time seeking out 'possible' kills and out of the xp Legendary Race.
---
Seeing as they do comment here and do implement things from reddit...
---
i do the same with annoying people on servers, if they do something bad i just search for their camp and blow it up.  
---
i know that costs almost nothing to repair but still.
---
Bahhhh
---
The wood walls with windows not wallpapering is a bug they know about - hopefully to be fixed.
---
I just want to drywall or wallpaper the friggin ceilings.  It seriously drives me NUTS.  We can build a fusion power reactor to light our homes, create laser guns, but we can't nail 4x6 panels to a ceiling?  I mean, COME ON.....
---
Berserker builds are so fun! I'm right there with you though, leveled up a new character (to complete my Order of Mysteries set) and went bloodied at LVL 31. Never have I entertained a bloodied build at such a low level, seemed almost comical, but that INT boost is hard to beat.
---
Ditto
---
Vampyr is fun! Very atmospheric, great lore. But the decisions for major quests can be a tad...counterintuitive. Also, I strongly suggest leveling up the blood ability that lets you freeze enemies in place, it‚Äôs very useful for dealing with stronger foes.
---
I thought that too, but the first fast travel lands me stuck in the wall. After that though, it lands me up by the colkectron.. I've learned to jump and move back whenever I fast travel to someone's camp to avoid getting stuck in the walls or ground.
---
Definitely the Mire, I try to get in and out quickly. I hate those charred scorched some days more than others
---
You. I like you.
---
I thought the daily reset was at 10am Eastern.

76 was originally planned as the final DLC for Fallout 4 set in West Virginia, but around the same time somebody at Bethesda worked out how to get multiplayer working on the engine. Instead of release it as a DLC to Fallout 4 they did it as the full game because the project was so large.
---
It's ironic because I think a Fallout DLC (not full game) where there's no NPCs and everyone is dead would be a cool premise, and it's a mystery you have to uncover slowly about who or what caused it and why. A lot of previous DLCs and favourite areas in the previous games (some of the cooler Vault experiments, Lonesome Road/Dead Money DLCs) do feature very limited NPC involvement if any at all, so it could definitely work.
---
Bethesda would probably have a lot more support if they released the West Virginia DLC for Fallout 4 for ¬£15-¬£20 (probably with a scaled down map). They could then try and retrofit multiplayer to Fallout 4 as another DLC you could play where you could host your own servers and play with friends in your Fallout 4 world and work together to build up the Commonwealth or fart around doing something else. If that didn't work, keep it as an ace in the hole for upcoming games and integrate it into the game but with more modern graphics and gameplay systems.
---
So question about that, does it negate 100% of fall damage? Or just 75% of it?
---
what things, im genuinely curious, ik they listens to here and forum bout ammo convertor but what else?
---
Or, maybe in the near future, the Institute will see this as a prime spot to setup shop in Appalachia......
---
Yup! They had about 6 turrets, 3 water purifiers, and the crane sign. Scrap it all!

*daily double sound alarms*
---
Trebeck: it‚Äôs a daily double!
---
Music to my ears, thanks for the info.
---
When I see these reminders, the theme song to Six Million Dollar Man pops into my head.  I don't know why - it doesn't make sense - but it does make me happy, and adds some drama to the situation.....
---
Ha yeah when you pass 200 the table get turned lol nice 1
---
Mire.  It creeps me out.  I don't trust anything in it.
---
Then there's that one guy who buys everyone's plans and robs the vendor for resale üòÜ
---
I‚Äôm not experiencing and issues up till last night?  Has it broke today
---
To echo what most people have already said, it really isn't worth nuking Whitesprings on a public server, there just always seems to be that one person that will run around and massacre everything before you even get there yourself.
---
I nuke it on Private servers now with my friends, purely so we can all get the rewards and share the XP, that just doesn't happen on a public server.
---
Radiation is a bloodieds worst night mare lol
---
What does that do? I have escape artist on and have 1 piece of chameleon so im curious
---
Hello. What's the SBQ lock bug and what does the toggle do?
---
Same here
---
only if it comes in N.I.R.A. style and sings the nuka world song randomly.
---
let it find cola's and nuka world related junk (toy cola cars, trucks, cups, plates, stuffed toys, etc)
---
For me the quest bug, everytime I go to him, I for some reason already have the stolen good. Yes to free gold bullion.
---
Well, after you saved him, and ascend as a god, you should kill him when he did that heart emote...
---
Then steal his junks and give thst to the other low leveled, but friendly player.
---
I like to use the Nightsight perk for QoL and it is terrible in the Mire (and totally useless indoors - how about a bit of buff?). The only other thing I really hate is deep water if I'm melee, and high cliffs are a pain, sometimes literally, regardless of perks/items.
---
I just don't want the levels. I didn't want much past 70ish. I had my character set up the way I wanted. People assume a lot about high level players but once you finish out your build and shed the last of your level up utility perks, levels are just numbers.
---
Agreedlooksincredible
---
I tried that while i had 1st, both times all the ghouls were already dead.
---
Also to craft SS armor.
---
&gt;Why are we still suspended?
---
Because you cheated ?
---
Might be that I use a unit that makes me invisible when crouching that messes with escape artist, but overall, I never had a good time with escape artist either way
---
They should add a "I'm Feeling Lucky" fast travel option
---
I must of over looked that thanks
---
The purveyor and player vending were requested features in both. They made a change in nuclear winter that made the circle much smaller, faster and reverted quickly based on player feedback. Lots of bugs are raised here (player vending exploits) and are addressed. 
---
I‚Äôm not going to pretend I think they are always the most timely, but they do listen to feedback.
---
Sheepsquatch are some of the toughest critters in the Wasteland. Good job. You are gonna love a horde of Murelik Kings.
---
Nope. Noon :)
---
Especially strangler armor since alot of new player dont know what it is
---
i think it is the interaction of chameleon and escape artist that is causing problems with stealth. So you would be fine if you have no chameleon and escape artist or chameleon and no escape artist.
---
Ooh. This‚Äôll be...unpleasant. Tadpole badges are frustrating, but you get a backpack that adds to carry weight when your done with the quest too!
---
I also enjoy picking out a random noob to follow around discretely. I aim for level 5-20 ideally. I keep a distance watching with my binoculars and save them from enemies that give them trouble or mobs too overwhelming. After half hour I pretend to randomly bump into them. I‚Äôll give them some items and tag along behind them after that for a while more. I‚Äôve received about 10 friend requests doing this. In fact it‚Äôs my favourite thing to do...
---
Thanks I miss read it I ate berry the first time and grape the second time.
---
AHH the bush got a big fucking gun üò±üò±üò±
---
So much for playing during my lunch break
---
In need, looks inevitable
---
This works for every weapon, not just the Gauss.
---
if i remember it right, i got the exact same bug.  
---
you need to take the elevator at hornwright estate to the lower level and there is a laser grid with a keycard reader. open it and then the quest makers were right again.   
---
walktrough to get the keycard to open the laser grid (copied from [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Secrets) ):      
---
&gt;!The player character needs to head all the way to the top of the Mega-Mansion and use¬†Penelope Hornwright's computer in her chamber at the western end of the mansion to print a keycard.
---
The computer is locked down with a keycode, however, and short of randomly guessing it, the player character has to locate three clues across the mansion to figure it out:!&lt;
---
&gt;!Charleston Herald - Tragedy Hits Hornwright: On the wheelchair in the master bedroom above Penelope.!&lt;
---
&gt;!RSVP card: On the counter in the eastern lounge.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Hornwright Industrial notice: On the table at the helipad.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Once they are gathered, it's a simple matter of trying the combinations out until one sticks. The keycard will be printed on the printer next to the computer and has to be collected separately!&lt;
---
Truth
---
From the responses here it looks like only the daily challenges are concerned by the double S.C.O.R.E. weekend not the weeklies unfortunately :(
---
T minus 8 minuted
---
Afaik, the cargobots around point pleasant means that the server is shutting down soon.
---
You will remain suspended until they have gone though all the players in suspension and investigated if you/they should be banned permanently. Last time i remember this sized banwave happened it took months for people to get lifted from their suspension.
---
Moral of the story: Don't cheat/exploit/dupe/hack or you pay the price.
---
not all of them.
---
I feel like if we had to deal with anything more than one beast we would get fucked. We did manage to 2v6 some Yao Gois last week, that was fun.
---
I‚Äôve heard people say there‚Äôs a 10 pound weight limit. It also collects stuff like bottles and such, depending on the setting, so whenever you go back to your CAMP, empty it out and let it start collecting more stuff
---
Just levelled up an alt as a heavy gunner and got the final word. It's definitely a bad ass gun.
---
Remove crafting bench animations!  It adds nothing to the game and can do nothing but slow down the painful process of scrolling through items. Also, remove the auto-rotation of items when viewing them. Again, adds nothing and makes things more painful than they have to be.
---
You‚Äôre Welcome! üëçüèæüëçüèæ
---
There are innocent people who did nothing wrong that have there accounts suspended . Also this is not the first time this has happened with fo76 . Innocent until proven guilty not the other way around !
---
 -No way to just boil water in the brewing station
---
- Not all dailies in the terminal
---
- Not a place on the map with a Scrip, Vendor and Goldmachine in one place
---
- Vats still being funky wonky, I liked to get a crit with my western revolver and then use the crit with my black powder pistol on Scorbo's but that no work no more
---
- Why 800? Why not 1000?
---
- WHAT DOES SCORE STAND FOR!!!!?
---
Exactly.  I have abour 1200 hours in and can't fathom 2 or 3k more
---
I was referring to dupers and them reading his repetitive posts he keeps making not Bethesda.
---
thats what i run also from the amount of people talking about it, it doesn't seem like the event team is as valuable unless you have four dedicated to ONLY pub events
---
The Fallout Forever üèÜ
---
This happened to me but it did appear the next time I logged in.. I was surprised there was no other trophy for 200,300..
---
Curious as to what information you think we have for you?
---
If you didn't dupe, receive duped items or have anything suspicious then you would be able to play. You know what you did or have in your inventory lol.
---
Yes but they‚Äôre people like me who never duped or cheated. If you don‚Äôt believe me just look at Bethesda‚Äôs support twitter and evidence of people‚Äôs account that were literally in-active with basically nothing on them got suspended.
---
I don't think it's that simple. I have multiple suspicious items, including what I think might be the only nuclear winter .44, and I didn't get a suspension at all. There are still people with nuke miniguns or freezing fixers on PC so it's clearly not that either. Dev room items like quantum paddle balls seem to be safe too. Many people on a cheating discord I joined to see the aftermath of this ban wave reported getting the permaban email a day or two after it started, so it looks like they did actually investigate those accounts. Although it also sounds like some of their accounts got away even with duped items. If anything, it seems like the flagging was done based on suspicious activity related to how the dupe was done or receiving large amounts of duped items at once
---
I'm pretty sure they are still processing tickets. It's only been one week, they stated it might take weeks or even months. If you didn't do anything, hold out hope for a bit longer
---
aye shit do that mean if i complain enough, they might fix fast travel?  Also thanks for the info bosss
---
Private world only too, just not as many ghouls / legendaries to go around as early days. But it‚Äôs still the only consistent source of high rad fluids unless I‚Äôm missing something (you can get a good amount of legendaries from Burrows, including the robots at the end, but no HRF, just glowing blood).
---
Yes all of them. You actually believe when someone comes here crying about being banned wrongfully? You must be new to online gaming..
---
Ya, I noticed today when I got booted i could rejoin my public team. So much better
---
To clarify - you neither duped nor bought/traded duped material?  Or utilized what they classified as exploits?  And you still got banned?
---
Raw deal if so.
---
Just because someone says "I got banned but I didn't dupe" doesn't mean they are telling the truth.  There have been many instances of people making these claims but when you go look at their post history there is clear evidence of them talking about duping and trading weapons that they duped.
---
Yes im well aware what you were saying and who you were saying it to
---
Hazmat suits don't grow on trees, it took forever to collect all these.
---
My parents were miners, but I never saw myself digging around in caves. 
---
May I be of assistance?
---
*insert chittering bugs
---
I'm getting so tired of these thorn bushes!
---
*insert guitar riff
---
I sometimes feel like the sound team is really trying too hard. They've done a great job in the game, but they need to chill the fuck out and relax the frequency that these sound events happen.
---
No it wasnt you. I was at the vendor. This was a guy also doing the stompy hurry up thing.  The lag with these vendors is more a hassle.
---
Nobody believes you. They don't just randomly throw suspensions/bans.
---
It's... strange, though. So many things in this game seem to contradict themselves... want to play with friends? You can join a Team, and share perks... but you still have to tag enemies the same as if you were random strangers to get XP. Legendary perks... slots will be unlocked account-wide, but card rank has to be leveled up for each character individually?? (Hopefully this can be changed before they launch it...)
---
Plus, this could be the seasons trying to encourage playing multiple characters... but the reputation and gold systems seem like they want you to focus on just one character?
---
It's just *weird* \- some stuff tries to be account-wide, yet others that could be, aren't...
---
It was worth it for me. Running with calibrated shocks and medic pump, and it‚Äôs holding up very well to assaultrons, Gutsys, nuke zones, sheepsquatches, SBQs, and Wendigo Colossus fights. It rarely needs repairs. Of all the stuff you can spend bullion on, it‚Äôs one of the better end game items in my book.
---
If the person jumping was in Excavator power armor and this happened last night, then I think it was me.
---
Indeed, looks levelable.
---
Survival was a mode with no need to initiate pvp. It was always on. You see some one and they are open to pvp
---
My dreams, need to settle down a bit.
---
It‚Äôs been acknowledged. If you are still experiencing it, it‚Äôs worth posting or at least submitting a ticket.  How often do you use trouble fast traveling though? I swear I haven‚Äôt had that issue in months.
---
Honestly I think "holy shit they have played the crap out of this game"
---
Yep! I have legacies that I did indeed bought However back during late 2018-2019 when they were dirt cheap and it was like a month after the ban wave that was similar to this.
---
My appeal was denied because It claimed I duped though so if I did bought a dupe around during this wave it wouldn‚Äôt be the reason anyways. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing since BETA lvl 314 and have over 700 hours. It sucks.
---
I have weekends free, but I would totally  sacrifice/vote for one of those weekend xp events to move weekdays - why not? It would help the diverse player base.  Make it so Bethesda!
---
Great idea.
---
Back when I wasn't 1k+ hours in the mire definitely gave me the willy's. Was pretty intense in the haha
---
Any of us higher lvls that has run across that booger by ourselves, no matter our build and lvl...goes through all of our ammo and stimpaks. Makes for some epic fun.
---
 However, you get a few bloodied PA builds together up against him...it is over way to quick.
---
Personally, when they get rid of the negative effects of hunger and thirst, I just think food and drink shouldn't rot when in the Stash.
---
Their weight, which you couldn't mitigate with perks, is enough of a limitation.
---
I read yours as you were referring to Bethesda. I‚Äôm obviously over thinking it here lol. 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt reddit without coffee :s
---
if you go in with the perk that makes you ignore traps while crouching you can actually shop in those ones without fear.
---
made a guy hella mad when i bought all his 5cap flux only for his punji cancer to not work on me :)
---
edit: the perk is [Light Footed](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Footed)
---
&gt;I have multiple suspicious items, including what I think might be the only nuclear winter .44
---
üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöìüö®üö®üö®
---
ur banned
---
I believe the facts. that A)Bethesda is extremely incompetent and B)a lot of dupers weren't banned. the big ones are still going strong and I've even seen some old names return.
---
so yeah. it's also not half a dozen posts complaining about being wrongfully banned, and the timing doesn't match. it's clear they're not just jumping on the bandwagon, at least not all of them.
---
They do. People even came up with a name for it. ‚ÄúBlanket Bans‚Äù atleast the definition when it comes to Bethesda handling things. It‚Äôs basically when a bot is in charge for doing suspensions and bans without a reason or a reason that doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
bruhh, ive had the fast travel bug for 200+ levels. I cant go nowhere without having to click 3-4 times. Ive lost track of how many events ive missed cause of non registering clicks. Ive also gotten the one where i click smthing and it teleports me to the random part of the map. I fast travel a fair amount so this one bothers me alot.
---
If you use heard mentality while in the group but aren‚Äôt actually near your teammates, do you still get the perks?
---
After she dies, she explodes, and that can throw the body pretty far away, and it's not the same for everyone.
---
If they just up'ed the holding limit for scrip, that would help too. I can hold 5000 (I think) Bullion but only 1000 scrip? I understand why they would want some sort of daily limit, but there isn't really a mechanic to properly save up (especially since it can take over 10 rolls to get even the type of weapon you want, let alone with the modifiers you are hoping for).
---
I'd also be okay with a spending limit. Perhaps make it like robot vendors where if you buy, it puts some back so you can sell more. Even if it was just equal to the trade in value (ie, buy a 3 star weapon for 100, legendary exchange now has 40 more scrip for the day). At least this way, if you buy a legendary and don't get something useful, you can at least trade it in right away.
---
There is also a difference between a developer saying ‚Äúyeah that would be cool/an easy fix‚Äù and their management giving them the hours/days/weeks/months needed to carry it out. Plus there is a bias towards new, marketable content like the Legendary Run, BoS return etc. Ongoing Support is not sexy.
---
Honestly I joined the game because of the new content with wastelanders. ‚ÄúWe fixed 15 annoying bugs‚Äù would not have been sufficient for me to buy it
---
You forgot the scavenger collection :)
---
I‚Äôm asking if anyone knows. And also I like to make posts like these to know I‚Äôm not the only one and know that there‚Äôs people who have the same issue I have.
---
Sophia floating in space forever and the Wanderer constantly trying to sell me her wisdom are annoying as fuck but it's not even remotely as bad as it was before push to talk got patched in. I will never forget launch day. Never. :(
---
Cranberry bog. The scariest thing in the game are those trenches.
---
it also doesn't mean that they aren't telling the truth. I don't doubt a lot of them are just exploiting the situation for their own benefit, but you'd have to be extremely naive to think Bethesda can do no wrong.
---
Loosely related... double-siding walls and customizable ceilings are higher priorities, but... Why can't we run electrical wiring inside the walls? We can build fusion generators, make nice, clean brick or wooden buildings... but they have to run electrical wires just hanging loose along the outside? Seems a bit odd... (Plus, I'd like to think being able to hide them would not only be nice for making cleaner-looking camps, but hopefully it would be less resource intensive, too, meaning it'd use less camp budget, maybe?)
---
Damn.
---
I wish I knew that at Fasnacht. I would have paid that PA idiot a visit.
---
Damage control and to generate good press. Just how it works nowadays. Everyone here would do they same thing if they ran a company that size.
---
Yeah, I agree with this. I get why it‚Äôs usually the weekend, but for those of us who work long weekend hours even the occasional double XP Tuesday would be nice.
---
Nothing.
---
Zorbo is more of a par - a representation of where you ought to be in order to complete the board on Day 70.  I presume he get technically gets there on Day 71 or something like that.
---
Great then :)
---
High Health - I run a full set of TS Secret Service Armor, plus a Vampire Gauss Minigun. I take some endurance boosting food &amp; a Psychobuff, then make sure I take all three pylons &amp; sit in her face until she's dead.
---
The whole thing takes about 2 mins to complete.
---
Addiction and boredom
---
I have the same problem.
---
Well, yeah. You failed the event and didn't kill it if no one took the pylons. You have to take the pylons to kill it and complete the event. Honestly, if you can't tank the pylons, you probably shouldn't start the event unless you are on a team and have a strategy where one of you can take them all.
---
Aww, I missed it
---
I think the problem is that everytime they fix something or implement new content, they never play it and dont realise its flaws. Then on top of that 15 other glitches that didint exist before do exist after the patch. It takes piss long for one hotfix to come out and by the time people are done downloading that hotfix, something new and fucked up is found.
---
No i dont. I see the correction now, nvm my comment
---
100%  I'm trying to break it so hard.
---
Thanks for share :)
---
Over level 400. I get so much score if I level on my main, but also have leveling alts if needed. I have dedicated the 5th slot to be my seasonal slot. every season (or twice a season) I will reroll it to get easy level ups about 1-2 days of the week
---
If you have two pieces that reduce fall damage by 50% it does indeed make you immune to fall damage from any height. It‚Äôs a lot of fun but hard to get used to going back to taking fall damage if you swap out your gear lol.
---
I see a lot of rubber banding - the postman drops them everywhere. 
---
Thankfully it's less problematic since they switched to biodegradable ones a few years ago.
---
i definitely didnt have it before the legendary run and i strangely dont have the issue with the ammo converter ü§î
---
You'd also have to be extremely naive to think that a cheater would have any moral qualms with lying about it later.  Sure, maybe there were some people that were caught up that were COMPLETELY innocent, but I bet that is by far and away a very small percentile.
---
Yeah I totally agree that forcing a high level player to create an alt to achieve a daily is nuts. I'm sitting at 299 I think and have no intention of managing an alt just to gain these battlepass points. I shrug it off as a boon to the new Xbox player community but I do find it incredibly annoying for the most part. Why does BGS continue to be so, so, out of touch with people who actually play the game regularly?
---
Wow cool you handled a trap camp like you're supposed to handle them.. But why come to reddit to cry about it? They got you, you got them. Problem solved. This post makes you looks like a baby though.
---
Edit: right almost forgot this reddit only exists as a crybaby circle jerk.. Good to be back lol
---
A lot of locations seem that there should be more to them, but they had to spend more time on getting the engine barely ready for online/multiplayer so they didn't have time to add the content that was gonna go there. 
---
E.g. I expected the observatory to contain some epic quest stuff but it's only some terminals again, just another dead location with some enemies. Now with wastelanders, BOS and other story content they may try to  inject some life into these places - at least I hope so.
---
Oh, for fucks sake... I thought it seemed like I was getting thrown into Danger way too easily again... Was wondering if maybe it was the armor I was using; have a Chameleon piece and two "improved stealth" pieces... but no, Escape Artist is borked *again*? **SIGH.**
---
You can destroy Camps with it?
---
For me personally the bonus XP would be better if it based on the amount of time played.
---
For example... Double XP begins and you have 10hours of gameplay that the bonus active. 
---
I never get a chance to get online at the weekend (stupid family)
---
However through the week is when I get more time online.
---
People with no lives will hate this idea, but for those of us who have busy lives this could be more beneficial.
---
Whitesprings resort main entrance all the damn time. Sometimes in 'the wild'. The resort though that is a damn pest.
---
Every single time? Jeeze
---
This is awesome, thanks!

I missed the mr pebbles backpack and I'm still kicking myself in the ass
---
I get most of mine from asparagus bundles

Thanks, Todd.

I like this one. When I hit my level that's enough for today.
---
TIL!
---
He is ascending into his Mothiness‚Äô divine light! Praise be to Mothman!
---
I stopped reading after your first sentence.
---
It also doesn‚Äôt help your (or anyone else actually falsely banned) case that there‚Äôs been a handful of idiots on here who post something similar to this and you can literally look through their post history to see they were helping people cheat and even boasting about doing it.
---
I so desperately wish we had the ability to have multiple camps, even if we could only have one active at a time. I've got this really nice homey kind of setup next to the farm in Morgantown, and it's right next to a couple friends with museum-like camps. When all 3 of us are on, it's a really nice area. Especially for business. But sometimes I just wish I could have a change of scenery when they aren't on.
---
ahh yes when community player base is less toxic than game developer
---
I hope so. There are plenty of places in Ohio I would like to nuke.
---
Rip no power armor again
---
See? Isn‚Äôt it nice to know more about something? It shows how shitty Bethesda is when it comes to stuff like this. But it‚Äôs also nice to know that you actually understand too. Because there‚Äôs people who selfishly say that if you got suspension than don‚Äôt cheat. Even though that‚Äôs far from what people believe. They only say that because they weren‚Äôt affected.
---
It's double daily, so you may as well do the weeklys
---
better sneak doesn't stack by the way. but yeah, I noticed it too. didn't test it too extensively because of all the exp grinding. but the moment I started randomly going from hidden to caution to danger and everything in between I knew something was wrong.
---
Not sure what you mean by a fortnight model. You say keep all the weeklies but a fortnight is only 2 weeks...
---
In my experience, if there's information to share regarding anything about the game, you'll see multiple posts about it.
---
Holy hell, this is the first thing I'm actually willing to spend atoms on.
---
&gt; He insta left the server. Fucking cunt. 
---
that's fucking great lol dropped mic
---
Lol! I know what you mean. Some of my childhood was in Ohio.
---
stove is cool i guess
---
Thats a weird notification then
---
shhhh it's not like it's even good. the laser sniper and crossbow are the only NW variants that are massively improved compared to their regular legendary max level versions
---
alright? because that's what I said originally? that not all of them cheated? and you just agreed with me?
---
I always figured they were the miners caught by radiation that melted them into their suits (I thought there was mention somewhere about people unable to remove their gear).
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to get an accurate time of how long. Usually it‚Äôs a day or so for me.
---
I‚Äôm all clean. Look through my post history I never posted anything about cheating whatsoever. I‚Äôve been in this sub and other fallout related subs ever since my account was created :)
---
thank you!!
---
Thanks, What's the last 2 tabs show?
---
Mire for me too. Other night it was about 2am real time. House is quiet. All is asleep. Creeping around the Mire at night. I can't see diddly. Animals are making their creepy ass noises. My clumsy arse kicks a can. My human self nearly squealed. Scared me silly. It was a damn tin can and not something trying to eat me.
---
I said maybe.  But it doesn't matter.  Bethesda is dealing with it.  Just taking time.  I for one am pleased with the results of the situation.
---
So why is there a dragon skin?
---
All of those suggestions seem like easy common sense ideas. Makes me think only 1 person is left working on this game. How do these programmers not bounce better ideas off of each other?
---
Another skip for me
---
Yes, yes, "Fortnite bad"... just ignore that line, then, and read the rest of it; seems like a reasonable idea to me!
---
That's a decent bundle. Atom Store has been stepping it up.
---
Cement tire walls seem nice for those doing a military aesthetic
---
The water wheel didn‚Äôt turn for quite some time. It was fixed not long ago.
---
I mean it's going to be able to play on the new consoles and be enhanced. Content won't stop when it comes out.
---
I thought I saw that maybe on a loading screen? But thats kinda a shitty place to put the only real lore we've got on them if true
---
Well god Damm... That's where that 5mm is coming from üòÇüòÇ
---
Whoo, the nighthawk is back! I had a tough choice between that and the american revolver paints last time it was back, but now I can afford it while it's back
---
I do it, but it's not the only reason.
---
When I came across it, I was like, wtf??? Took a photo too. I think it's a cool little feature. I thought the cargo bots got sick of being shot down for their nuclear keycards and where planning an uprising!
---
Nice! How do you like the secret service armory? Just bought the cheat piece and am working up for the other parts.
---
Yes but I don't hop from team to team doing it ..if u r doing that..yes, u r a bit of an a**hole..but a tolerable one (not the worst thing u could b doin).
---
I wont say everytime but 6/10 is a fair number
---
I did that same jump after completing the event few days ago, manage to activate the effect from Mothman, and landed unscathed with the help of serendipity.
---
I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt believe you, just giving you some perspective as to why some people attack these posts. As with everything else in life, other people try to ruin it for everyone.
---
I understand.
---
Current implementation of group PvP sucks and heavily favors the attacker.
---
It‚Äôs a lot more durable than the scout armor I was using before
---
No? Pfft, figures. I kept *meaning* to watch Angry Turtle's video on stealth to try and check that, but hadn't quite gotten around to it yet... thanks for the short explanation!
---
I think it's 7 weeks from today.
---
can you go into the school without doing the PVP event?
---
It is, and a lot of people you run into in adventure that are up for pvp don‚Äôt want a fair fight. But since I primarily use a rifle I‚Äôm not to worried about accidentally shooting someone, if I shoot them  chances are it‚Äôs on purpose.
---
 Especially with the OP who openly admitted to using godmode glitch in pvp battles, but always conveniently leaves that out in these multiple daily victim posts.
---
Around the 15th of September
---
You make it sound like I wanted us to fail. I didnt, I paid to create that recall keycard, I wanted more people to show up. I know how to do the event, I've managed to complete it in just a DUO, when I had the stims to tank all 3 pylons.
---
Just because I cant do that every single time doesnt mean I should sit out and not play the game. Shit like that happens, you win some you lose some. It wasnt your money spent, it wasnt your time spent, and therefore you do NOT get to dictate what I do and do not get to start/participate in.
---
Edit: I started an event that I knew was going to take more than just the 3 people that showed up. Only 3 people showed up out of a FULL server, and that is not something I can control.
---
Yeah, especially now that you get ultra limited free atoms per month.
---
True unfortunately. It‚Äôs also probably the reason why I haven‚Äôt been un-suspenders yet because Bethesda‚Äôs busy looking into ‚Äúinnocents‚Äù accounts even though they know what they did.
---
hahaha that's rich.  If you godmode exploit you probably dupe too.  It's like a gateway crime!! lol
---
Heyo, /u/Valseek . Thanks for the fix, but also checking in here to see what happens about the Atoms that were incorrectly paid to the wrong account? I received 40 today, but still have several hundred stuck over my a Bethesda.net account I never logged into.
---
I heard certain mutations might trigger it like healing factor. Not sure though.
---
The first time i entered the ash heap and The mines over there i was pretty on edge. Nowadays its The mire due to The atmosphere
---
I didn't know about this! i've fixed it by using rugs, I noticed if the item is on a rug it never teleports up
---
 You also admittedly used godmode glitch in pvp battles.  Again at least show all the facts if you are going to cry victim.
---
decreasing the minimum amount of time for a cell to "unload" when nobody is in it would help the server quite well.
---
otherwise sectioning the map into 4 parts using loading screens and separate servers would probably help the game massively though this would be the unpopular route but would help make the world more populated since each section would contain a separate 24 people while at the same time lower the load on a server due to less active cells in total since fragmented map.
---
They should alternate camp items and armor and weapons skins. I literally have no use for camp objects as most of them aren't cool enough to justify purchasing, guess ill save my 5200 atoms until next week.
---
For the 3 dozen legendary ones that have dropped in the history of the game, that and the thousands of the BE15 one that got duped I guess
---
I've crunched the numbers after Double XP weekend myself.  You need 220,275 total SCORE to complete the board.  At rank 69, I'm at 124,950, which means I have 95,325 left to go (this really goes to show how much that +25/rank adds up, by the way).
---
So at that rate, with what we believe are 48 days remaining, I need to pull a little over 1,985 SCORE a day to complete the board.  Dailies + Weeklies alone still won't cover that, although they come close.
---
A what?
---
np! go get dat bread!
---
Hey I tried to use the explosive bait but nothing happens.
---
Very true
---
it's a good idea which means they will never do it
---
Yeah, I've seen it end up in some weird spots. Wondering if I just didnt look hard enough for it, but I cant go back and redo it now :(
---
When Zorbo reaches the goal
---
Don‚Äôt take things out of context. I did NOT intentionally got godmode. Godmode can happen as a accidental glitch if your killed by a legacy. And besides I was suspended because they claimed I ‚Äúduped‚Äù. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have evidence that backs me up being accidental such as video recordings but it can happen sometimes.
---
If you look at everything else I‚Äôm clean. I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong whatsoever.
---
Edit: if you don‚Äôt believe me still I activated godmode accidentally I literally have a post asking for Bethesda for players to ban people who got to tier 100 and the only way to do that was to be godmode.
---
Last time I killed a low level player that was constantly shooting me, his level 500 buddy that was hiding outside blew my camp up to pieces lol
---
Is the lamp separate or only in the bundle right now? I really like the lamp and the stove but honestly could pass on everything else right now. Love the new free icon- he looks how I feel honestly
---
that's arguable to say the least. even one person getting wrongfully banned is one too many. it just shouldn't happen, let alone take months to be resolved. if Bethesda's track record prove anything is that they can't do anything right.
---
case in point, the big suppliers are still around. no big name duper has been banned. the only thing they managed was to ban half the playerbase, those who accepted or duped in small quantities. big brain move right there.
---
and to top it off, the code is still a mess. another dupe is happening sooner than later because the actual cause hasn't been addressed and probably never will.
---
I think they broke this even worse with the latest update, I am suddenly unable to remove something I was perfectly able to remove before and no matter how much I add to it and such it keeps doing this, I'm probably going to have to redo my whole fucking camp because of this bullshit.
---
Eight hundred hours before I got my first pie. Then I got 14 in a row, all from different machines.
---
"Why does BGS continue to be so, so, out of touch with people who actually play the game regularly?"
---
Half the replies in here are telling me that I should make a toon because it's not hard and my refusal to fall in line is punished by downvotes because, apparently, I'm playing the game the wrong way.
---
There's your answer. ;)
---
Just camp and hope you survive to the top 10 also especially do nw during double XP
---
Ditch last laugh and 2 ranks of class freak to get 3 ranks of serendipity. 45% chance to ignore damage is a big survival step for any toon with low health.
---
Replace weapon artisan with gunsmith.
---
Obviously need to incorporate adrenaline once they fix it.
---
I like 2 ranks in bandolier for the extra weight reduction.
---
Around 75% of XP comes from how long you live, so play it slowly and avoid engagements.
---
Same.
---
I finally came up with a long term design that stayed true to the whole camp vibe. I have the little pod building on the atomic shop as a four man living area for my team with a campfire out front bordered by all my crafting stations. I have a red rocket garage on side with a deck bigger than the garage attached with an eating area with tables, I have my vending machines set up inside along with an ammo converter, Beckett's bar is posted up on the "boardwalk" area as you walk up to the deck along with a little memorabilia corner with my display cases. My genny is blocked off by concrete walls and theres a little turret guy stationed right around the corner for those npcs feeling frisky.
---
Seems to only be in the bundle.
---
It was adventure mode with pvp always on. Only the top 3 players were visiable on the map based on time stayed alive so the longer you lived you would be exposed.
---
 There were weekly challenges that would reward a unique weapon. Anytime i played it seemed like only 1 server was open so despite people wanting it back it didnt seem very popular but that was also probably due to the timing.
---
I wish they would bring the little free cat topiary back. I was in the hospital when it was out and I missed it sadly.
---
*Definitely* the Mire. I dunno what it is about the settings on my TV and PS4 or whatever, but nights in general get more or less "realistically" dark for me... and the Mire gets *so* dark its downright *spooky*. Heck, I used to have my Camp over there, and after whatever update made it darker, I threw a bunch of those super-bright construction lights on my roof to light up the surroundings because it was creeping me out so much! And now I'm back in the Forest, right next to the river - not as convenient, but I love the view of the water. :)
---
 Hard to take you seriously when you need to be called out to tell the truth, or at least a half-truth.
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping the Responders pip-boy and gurney beds come back soon ),:
---
Thank you for letting me know
---
Same. Feels wrong...
---
It was quite good fun for short sessions and for the weekly rewards
---
They did not.  They adding logging in a hotfix to help them determine the cause.
---
Update for ya, in case you‚Äôre curious; 
---
My issue has evolved to a flat-out CTD on load-in. I can‚Äôt even fucking play at all, now. And still no response from the support team.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
super helpful, I had no idea it just rewards you for existing haha
---
Oh yeah man no problem :)
---
\+1 faced the same issue
---
rubberbanding hp from enemies makw me grab my shotgun and blow their heads off before they get the chance to regenerate/rubberband
---
I peed, looks delectable.
---
And after reset.... It still happen to me.... 2 weekly and 6 daily gone... With out any score.
---
Shouldn't have believed them....
---
It‚Äôs kind of fiddly. You have to log off, get back on. Sometimes fast traveling around the map. But they will reset.
---
...Because I have one and I want one ...?
---
Instead of being a dick it was accidental. If you don‚Äôt believe me I literally have a post saying to ban people who reached tier 100 back when you couldn‚Äôt skip tiers. It was only achieved by doing a godmode glitch. It would be silly of me to use godmode and exploit it just for me post asking a ban wave for people who reached tier 100 using godmode.
---
Just make it to top ten- honestly they don‚Äôt award enough xp for kills. So do the bush Wookie
---
Still have 9 dailies here...
---
Yes, this is very annoying bug.
---
Awesome thanks
---
I'm on PS4 and have 9 dailies and 8 weeklies
---
Yep. I realize I have no carry weight when I drop the unyielding.
---
No sense of humour?
---
Probably intentional. I thought I read they were increasing them for last weeks rotation but I took that as it won‚Äôt be a constant.
---
Cheaters are always the first one to call out others, deflects off themselves.
---
More have popped up for me now. Strange.
---
I would of mentioned it but it was not the reason what Bethesda thought I did.
---
Never knew that! Thanks.
---
Clear it, fast travel away, log out and log straight back in. Usually the enemies will respawn. I use this as most of Whitespring is dead once you launch the nuke, so you have to go out and back in to get anything.
---
Because the robots killed everyone? Before Wastelanders EVERYTHING was dead, so...
---
Maybe just go up to the roof of Westek and pick up the ppp just sitting there instead. Switch servers and do it again as many times as you like as well.
---
Keep class freak loose crit savy, pickup rank 3 serendipity. 
---
If he runs unyielding he will have 30 luck. So each hit fills crit meter 50% . Mean a crit procs after 2 attacks. Crit savy is 100% pointless in that situation and a waste of 3 perks.
---
If he hits 34 luck and runs crit savy than he can crit every other shot because his meter will fill 56% per shot .
---
The ban wave made little difference on Steam, it was like a few % drop at most. You can see the graph [here](https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/). Perhaps other platforms have more dupers because cheap third party keys are usually for Bethesda.net, and of course the game is "free" on Game Pass. But it is also difficult to make accurate comparisons with Fallout 4, since many players of 76 are not on Steam.
---
At this stage in the lore the Intitute is a bunch of dorky professors hiding in a basement. It won't be formally founded for another 40 years or so. 
---
That being said, Bethesda have found a way to shoehorn super mutants AND the BoS into Appalachia, so I wouldn't put it past them. I'd prefer them to come up with new factions.
---
I love this idea. I play every week night and the weekends are my time to go out with my friends. I don‚Äôt want to lose my social life! This is why I missed two days of the double xp this last weekend
---
I lost 5500 weekly points this morning. I am pissed.
---
I've made sure to do the Double XP event, and the general Repeatable XP collection, on my Lv. 430+ main rather than my two alts, simply because it helps to have other toons who are easier to level.
---
It's not ideal.  But on the other hand, I think if I level my main once a day, that is generally what I have to do to complete the board at this point anyway.  It might as well be her.  No sense in making it harder to grind levels on the other two.
---
Not weird at all, they want you to replay content because they can't put out new content fast enough to keep "mains" busy.
---
Great, thanks!
---
How long is it up for? (I‚Äôm working and can‚Äôt check)
---
Sweet mutt fruit tea for rifleman (with herby you get 40% crit boost and it lasts for an hour like cranberry relish, so I usually take both at the same time).
---
Wish they would make it easier to find the free item lol I can never find it
---
I join em for the XP, but the travel points are a good bonus.
---
I'd you have the communist collectron I'd use that since it brings back so many different types of soups for you as well, makes life abit easier.
---
I have that terminal. So today I activated my *now* three daily quests completed toxic waste and insect parts then travelled to Biv and as I said, went up to him then (on PC) clicked E to Interact and nothing happened other than the map marker disappearing.
---
May be a glitch, I'll keep trying for a few more days then send a support ticket.
---
Complete public events and kill legendary enemies
---
Good luck! Hope it helps!
---
&gt;even one person getting wrongfully banned is one too many.
---
This is where we disagree.  If the options were use the current method to dish out the bans with POSSIBLY a few false flags or have no bans at all then it is definitely worth it.  You gotta break a few eggs to bake a cake.  If that mentality was held by world leaders and titans of industry and other movers and shakers nothing would ever get done or be accomplished.
---
I'm sure if there were people who were actually banned incorrectly they will receive their accounts back.  Hell, maybe some have and we just don't know about it.  We don't know.
---
Here is what I do know, even after the investigations are complete, there will be people who straight up duped and cheated and were rightfully banned and will still come on here to write and lie and say they did nothing wrong.  I will not believe these people.
---
I have a one-star instigating Dragon that I use pretty commonly, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna spend atoms on a skin for it.
---
Also the part that really looks different I'll never really see so there's that to consider, too.
---
I do exactly this ,I own the perve in the Bush role. Although I never seem to get friend requests from low levels.
---
I wish more people used a Mic. I seem to be the only dude talking. The only other people I've met who are on the mic are adolescent men... Which is a bit weird for me. I'd prefer a stoner adult to chill with.
---
Or they speak German. And even when I emote "follow me" in a party. They don't. All I want to do is share the 3* legendarys I find.
---
you're bugged, im 8 week 9 daily
---
I have that serum, and I think several in my machines, 275 per, IIRC. I‚Äôll be loggin on in about 15 minutes.
---
aj ninetyeight
---
I tried that one and the quest was gone. I'll try tomorrow üëç
---
Same with the fermenter.
---
sounds like a great way to get back at griefers trying to pvp you
---
You're in luck because if you turn off fill teams then there's no way anyone could call you a douche for camping.
---
They brought back one for the extremely popular Fatman too. Those guys at Beth really know and care about what everyone is using üëå
---
Because pickaxe skins weren‚Äôt niche enough. Coming next: a skin for the rolling pin that has bloody dough stuck to it.
---
I'm not worth the worship. Give the love to our beloved Mothman.
---
You have something wrong here mate. Sheepsquatch NOT flying from the start! Dont compare them. When u cripple queen she still fighting on the ground performing attacks. But sheepsquatch just laying on the ground doing nothing. Why even compare flying and non flying boss lol, thats just stupid
---
There is tire walls for Fallout 1st members
---
OK, I didn't do that actually, thanks I'll go try spamming the E.
---
If you catch it right on the changeover time you see some  strangeness, with partial lists and completed challenges. Leave it a few minutes and it usually settles down.
---
Did they nerf the sweet Tato stew from him? That stuff was godly
---
üòé
---
Dude think of this logically. Why would I abuse godmode and than ask Bethesda  to ban godmode or patch it? God mode can be a accidental bug and it has happened before. I literally just said that if your killed in PvP by someone using a legacy it can happen.
---
Of course the Sheepsquatch head is bundle-only
---
It is. Just not 500 atoms cool.
---
Like many others, its the Mire that creeps me out the most. The darkness, the vines everywhere its horrible. Cant wait to get out of there when I do go.
---
Looking forward to trying this.  Makes a strong case for a rank or two of Gun Fu for sure.
---
I can't be the only one who thinks there are more than enough PA skins lol
---
no first update ?
---
I couldn't stand ark. I have serious trust issues after trying that game. Definitely not my thing.
---
Thanks for info, I'll go try spamming the E.
---
weeklies don't count for double score
---
Agreed, looks indelible.
---
It was 400 at the begining.
---
That's why i roll a new character for the level up Daily Challenge. The level from the in the Vault doesn't count but you can hit level 3 pretty quickly, especially if you have inspirational (you can at that level!) and join a building team. Hit up the quests in Flatwoods and Morgantown and each one is usually rewards with a level. Until about level 6-7 it tapers off so i drop their stuff at wayward and roll a new character to start it all back up.
---
NEVER play NW or Be online at reset hours, NEVER
---
So did I. This is complete bullshit. I wasn‚Äôt even logged in when they switched.
---
enjoying summer? üòû
---
I use Steeped Aster Tea (Or mutated fern forget what it ks called) for 4+ strength and Silt Bean soup for 4+ End as well.
---
Missed what?
---
Oh I thought they mutated from working with uranium while using mining suits...at least that's what I pieced together from reading all the terminals.
---
Who knew the mining lore would be so deep for a game? haha.
---
The Bog. Fuck those trenches.
---
that's what i figured damn, might as well do em today then
---
The link got removed
---
fallout 1st
---
Just take us to the Pitt. Maybe say the virus from there was the Scorched Plague or something.
---
My alt character's camp is along rail tracks and set up like a ticket counter (with my collectron bot stuck behind it) and waiting area on one side of the tracks and a gift/snack shop on the other.   You can access the vendors through the front windows from the outside and there are several decorative stash boxes around (trash bin, newspaper machine,  suitcases, etc.) The inside is just display cases with teddies, mr. fuzzies, and other stuff.  You absolutely don't have to go inside unless you want to use benches (though the PA bench is outside to scrap on) but it is also designed to look fun and welcoming.  People come in and give me heart emotes and even drop stuff for me often and it's great.  You can absolutely lean into having fun, form, and function with a bit of creativity. 
---
I plan to redo my main character camp from a standard house (with vendors lined up outside) to make my own sort of red rocket megastop using recent atomic shop items.
---
no, we don't disagree. I do agree with that mentality. the problem is that world leaders and tech giants don't make stupid mistakes. they're not incompetent to the point of writing an ineffective script.
---
the same can't be said about Bethesda. I'd agree with you 100%, except I know better. I know that their method is ineffective and harming innocent players for little gain.
---
the fact rmt haven't been affected at all proves this.
---
Bethesda turned future development and maintenance over to the newly acquired Austin studio. They had never worked on a Fallout game, never worked with the game engine and never worked on an online game. When you realize this everything that has been happening suddenly makes sense.
---
Do we know the FO1 discount this week?
---
Why does anybody play this anticonsumer piece of shit game?
---
Oh yeah definitely. It makes it easier.
---
I don't think you wanted it to fail but you didn't do anything to help keep it from failing. You can't count on folks showing up unless you have a server full of higher levels. I think that everyone that shows up for that event should be ready to do their part to complete it and that means being ready to take a pylon. The other guys that did show up should have been ready as well.
---
My friends and I will try to judge a server after a scorchbeast queen fight. If you get enough high level players there, you should be good to run Encryptid.
---
Edit: I've completed this event with 3 people before but you all have to do your part. I've seen people solo this event but that takes an optimized build.
---
Kill 5 creatures in NW? They said they will lower shits like this :)
---
lol... yes... Takes me a year to lvl up from 0 -96 with that method... winning is actually the best way... but I never play with teams so  I never win... I jst reach top 10 about 70% of the times
---
OK, thank you kind sir or madam.
---
Tip: when demolishing a camp, go for the reactor and the decontamination shower. The shower alone has prohibitive repair costs.
---
If understand it right, the TrueAchievements site uses the total number of people who played a game at all over a week (it does not matter if it was for 1 hour or 10 hours that week). It would be more clear though if they revealed the actual numbers. While Steam's chart for example shows the number of people in game at a given time, which is normally much lower because they obviously do not play 24/7. Maybe the Microsoft chart works similarly to Steam's, although it does not seem to be continuously updated. It does seem to have separate lists per region, which can be changed in the URL (e.g. "en-us" for the USA).
---
In any case, neither chart is necessarily "inaccurate", they just use different methods for calculating the player numbers. And that affects whether the chart favors (relatively) games that are occasionally played by many people for a short time vs. those that are played a lot by a smaller group.
---
Clear the whole area, drop the nuke, don't go there for about 10 minutes. That usually works.
---
It‚Äôs actually a really good model that is mostly consumer friendly. The only better one I can think of is Red Dead‚Äôs
---
20 days
---
Yeah and have three more people to worry about and have zero change of having them win the game... Logging in solo seems to prove ZAX rigth, you were not made to be Overseer... Im there to play it smart, not strong.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f145cf&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pp2pl2s00ek0ce0c62ir2a72ao0a30an2l71lt2lu2lv0ic1a12a00la2l12sg2&amp;w=iq1eu0&amp;m=51c29fe8&amp;am=132735-132735-132735-132735-132735&amp;wp=w5&amp;wm=142534
---
Those are the perks i run.
---
A full set of unyielding makes you more invisible to enemies than tbe chameleon and is way more beneficial.  Also found the sneak perk doesnt make much of a difference with that much agility (using unyielding and shielded road leeathers). 
---
Serendipity, dodgy, blocker keep you alive. Grim reapers sprint is amazing and will 100% fill your AP, helps keep you dealing damage and keep dodgy procing.
---
You dont need crit savy with 30 luck.
---
I‚Äôm with you. Especially with how many are in the legendary run..
---
Jet doesn't even exist yet.
---
Fine for me
---
Same here but had PA on. Everyone else left by the time he finally landed.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it 9 one time? Lol
---
Concrete tire wall for 250 atoms
---
It‚Äôs always in the last tab.
---
Farm west Tek!
---
Got pics?
---
Because not everyone has had the same experience with the game as you.
---
Guess we'll have to make do with the 487,000 power armor skins we already have
---
Top right panel, my dude. Says free right on the tin.
---
It's nice to come back to this subreddit after a while, and see assholes getting what they deserve.
---
Okay thank you
---
Oh boy the ugly electric fireplace 2000!
---
Most disappointing thing I've ever spent Atoms on
---
You would think that PA is the best end game armor base off of how many skins it has.
---
Didn‚Äôt do either of those things. Logged on at 12:10 eastern today after not having played since like 10:00 last night. This is just stupid.
---
They said in last ITV they deployed a fix and tracking.  It seems that it was a partial, low hanging fruit type fix.
---
I have a ritual for the reset:  as I eat breakfast I log in each character, start my vendor clock ticking by selling a Bobby pin, sort some gear if needed (fallout first), log out before 845 and login after 915.  I‚Äôve not had another autocomplete (have had 2 before, 1750 gone total) so this is my routine each day.
---
I mean, as someone who has no intention of running a bloodied or any other kind of ‚Äúbuild‚Äù (I have a smattering of legendary heavy weapons, rifles, and a legendary pump-action, so I suppose that‚Äôs the build?), power armor is great for me because I have 100 extra pounds of carry weight (Excavator), and the damage reduction is also quite useful, especially when facing Mr. Gustys, Scorchbeasts, or hordes of enemies.
---
True. I should of remembered that considering I wrote a post on the virtues of crit savvy over other crit perks over a year ago.
---
Thanks for letting everyone know
---
I thought it seemed like I was getting spotted way to much in chinese stealth armor recently.
---
And/or:
---
Allow us to choose a perk for sharing that doesn't depend on CHR level, but that perk doesn't affect us, only teammates. So if I for example chose Green Thumb, all my teammates would get double from harvesting, but I wouldn't. It would give a purpose to use some perk cards that don't directly benefit our build, but that we would want to share. It may also encourage coordination between team members, as you could be smart with choosing your shared perk to directly benefit your team members' builds.
---
What answer do you really expect? It's a fun game and it has improved a lot
---
I believe they did although I still get a decent supply of it from him, plus a few at workshops and you'll be all good still.
---
Just start dumping points into strength. Intelligence is helpful with perks like stabilized(a must have) and you can throw In power user if you‚Äôre short on cores. Nerd rage is crucial if you want to go bloodied to max your damage output. So keep your intelligence for now. I have 1 perception on my build though, so start by taking your points from there. It‚Äôs a bummer the 2XP weekend just ended, but you‚Äôll just have to grind levels to get the points. West tek is great for XP.
---
I‚Äôll try this later and, if it works, you are a genius.
---
Happy cake day btw
---
Its possible, like I said they tell us very little about them,someone mentioned it might have been in a loading screen tip but I havent really seen much attempting to explain a new unique enemy
---
There is also no way you would win, if you camp and have 3 less people to worry about then you get called douche, but you might win... think like ZAX, your goal is to survive, use your brains, not your gun. Remember, having the atitude of a winner adds 0.5% to your chances of winning, having 3 less enimies adds much more.
---
But if you can neuter a Sheepsquatch, then surely that‚Äôs the most efficient way to deal with it? We don‚Äôt need anything even bullet spongier. It‚Äôs hard enough for a poorly made build/low level as it is.
---
Ty
---
Sigh, the 3 things I want aren't there, yet again. Fish lamp, Cat topiary, and thanksgiving display.
---
6 months now been waiting for the stainless fridge to come back.
---
Yeah, after that, they promised they will lower to minimum.
---
Sorry, no PA and happened about a month ago
---
Can always go shopping at other players vending machines.  A lot of people will sell weapons that are good but don't fit their build.  Some people for less than others.
---
Thanks üñ§
---
Thanks I'm been blind today lol üòÇ
---
I went with a basic open multi platform design but had to Build stairs up and down to make it work. That said Im only useing that spot with my main Im not crazy enough to try it twice.
---
the dragon is a variant of the black powder rifle with four barrels. i've had one drop exactly once (over a year ago) and it sits in my stash not doing anything.
---
They‚Äôll be DOA when you first arrive. Just log out and right back in. All alive. You‚Äôll have about 2 hours real time to farm before radiation clears. Tons of fluorescent, lots of crimson. Expect no less than a half dozen legendaries. Make sure you travel light.
---
I doubt it's a bannable offense.  I imagine it'll get fixed sooner rather than later now that there is lots of attention being drawn to it.
---
He is the BOOS, turning him to harmless roadroach is not good. I mean, game is one shot fest already, players need some challenge, i doubt that vendigo colossus will be able to crippled that way, cuz he is the BOSS, i dunno if you can see my point
---
We need some decent display cabinets like the thanks giving ones I missed
---
 Except for Excavator.  Not too many for that one.Was really glad to finally get the one from the Score run.
---
I‚Äôm liking the hunter bundle :)
---
I run PA heavy weapon build. You could move your Perception into strength and move your intelligence into agility and luck. I have 15 strength, 3 perception, 6(?) charisma, 8(?) intelligence, 10 agility, and 7 luck give or take a few. I like intelligence as I can use portable power and power user so you‚Äôre not too bad off with it being high. For the dps, I‚Äôd recommend taking on junkies with PA and heavy weapons. I do a ton of damage and am also a tank in my PA. Plus you can really distribute your perks to whatever you want as junkies besides a few necessary ones
---
Blight soup is kinda easy to create. It improves critical shot damage. Handy if your a VATS user.
---
I'll be honest, I forgot there was a weapon in the game called The Dragon, and this comment got me really excited for something weird.
---
Scrapbox if you want to pay.
---
Otherwise, your best bet is to use Perk Cards/Mods/Weight Reduction Legendaries, store anything with low to zero weight (either naturally or due to the above) on your character, and use your Stash for junk (as it is the only thing that drops when you die), and items that aren't affected by weight reduction.
---
That sounds delightful. I‚Äôd definitely spend time exploring that. My favourite so far has been a camp I found in the mire, it was positioned superbly and had all mire themed items and rooms, whilst fitting into a curve in the road for the actual structure. There was a natural cave side room that blended seemlessly also .
---
I took photos and actually recorded me wandering around it it was so impressive. I chilled there for a bit and bought a load of random items I didn‚Äôt need just to show appreciation at the creativity. 
---
Owner was chill as hell also. Camps are one of my favourite things now I‚Äôve done pretty much everything else and I‚Äôm endlessly amazed at what people accomplish.
---
I think, we have all been there at some point.  Your inner OCD has u caught up in the Bethseda grind. Look my advise would be....take a break for a couple of days and forget about unlocking everything. Pretty good chance, you wont use half of it anyway.
---
As others have said, join a public server and hsve some fun. The game gets pretty monotonous without other Wastelanders.Get out in Appalachia and meet new people..er,characters..always leads to some kind of crazy adventure.
---
The vast majority of the time you can camp in a bush while on a team and no one will care, either. Sometimes you get on a team with 2-3 other people who play it safe and you all end up alive at the end. Personally I play with fill team on because even if I'm hiding I still pay attention to the game and am not a dead weight who dies when the fire gets to me. I also snipe people from safe spots. It's extremely easy to find a hunting rifle right away.
---
Cool, I have some aster plants at my camp
---
 My wife and I have been waiting for this to return, we were so excited!
---
Hmmmm ok ok. I'm just trying to grind the raider dailies so I can have that damn armco thing to have my own ammo thing as well.
---
I'm not a lower level player but still, it is a great joy to notpay for travelling. Also, nowadays I'm collecting plans and I need those caps!
---
Melon
---
Those are the boards with spikes, right? How does that kill you instantly?
---
Funny...I saved from nearly 2-3 months into the game a 2 shot gamma with +25% firing speed and something else. Haven't used it ever until we had NPCs and the thing is bloody fun on raiders!
---
this would be a nice bonus to!
---
I just wish they would rotate camp items one week, armor and weapon stuff the next. As someone who doesn't care much for camp stuff it's irritating waiting a week just to see it's more of the same basically.
---
Yes, Inspirational and free travel is (for me) the best parts of public teams. I only use them for extra event xp when I'm not camp hopping.
---
I get a pop up about how to craft film ever since Wastelanders hit.
---
Well, my legendary (now legacy) dustcatcher Dragon would be happy... but I wont buy the skin.
---
That‚Äôs the thing. He‚Äôs not a boss. It‚Äôs about the closest thing you get to encountering a boss in the wild though, I‚Äôll give you that. And even a good rifleman build won‚Äôt one shot the thing, but commando and melee are ridiculously powerful.
---
It happened to me as well. It was only one weekly but that is still 1000 points lost. I am grateful it was not worse though.
---
BTW: Is it still worth me submitting a ticket about this? It does not seem like anything gets done about it when you do.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. I just stumbled upon the glitch by accident when someone left the server as soon as I hopped on their ride. If you have a friend that plays and has the ride then it should be pretty easy to coordinate the glitch. If not you‚Äôd have to CAMP hop until you find someone with the ride and ride it until the leave the server lol I thought I recorded it but apparently I forgot too. I rode through Morgantown and was being chased by like 10 ghouls.
---
I did that exact same setup at my camp! I have a rock ledge that overlooks my front lawn and it sits perfectly in the grass behind it.
---
That‚Äôs an old skin, for a weapon that no longer drops as legendary!
---
I‚Äôd love a skin for anything that currently doesn‚Äôt have one.  It‚Äôs my main insurance policy against accidental dropping.
---
Are you wanted?
---
So do I, I move from place to place, storm aint gona kill me
---
Yikes. Such a shame for such a beloved franchise. Hopefully they figure it out.
---
Niceeee...
---
I have the same problem, disconnect anc re-connect to another sever.
---
This tbh. Everyone has different tastes in what weapon they want to use. Conversely I‚Äôm asking why there aren‚Äôt any skins for the LMG. I‚Äôd love a nice gold MG3 to display on my wall in my camp.
---
I had to team hop a lot in a single day. And it made me feel so ashamed, I felt like I was making the other players angry by joining and leaving. But now that I see everyone does it, I'm relieved.
---
You also got s full set of raider power armor from the quest.
---
....and he deletes account along with the post
---
I don‚Äôt know what you expected, they aren‚Äôt going to hand out awesome weapons to everyone who completed a quest. I‚Äôm sorry you did it at low level. There are some weapons down there and I usually scrap them to learn plans. Also a good amount of ammo and meds. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs ‚Äúempty‚Äù
---
Good to know. Thank you
---
The Green Thumb Bundle was probably one of the best ones in terms of value and versatility.
---
I‚Äôm assuming it does. Pretty much all animations continue when someone leaves the server if you are doing something at their camp I believe.
---
Great to know, I was starting to feel super ashamed for it.
---
I was 100% certain someone posted here nearly a year ago how someone played on their mic the sound of a suicide super mutant getting ready to attack with the distinguishable timer and that did the job of scaring them the fuck out of the vendor. 
---
I think it'd work for all of us if we were in the white spring train station.
---
They will still gather stuff even if you block them. Ive seen people do this at camps to make a robot bartender by putting the fancy bar set around the collectron.
---
I was killing those explosive eyebots, gutsies, and protections. I was participating, I didnt just sit there and expect everyone else to do it and I would tap the assaultron at the very end to get the legendary. 
---
I have outright said that I could not tank the pylons, I had 6 stimpaks on me. SIX. But I run a sealth commando build, so I was okay to fight and participate as long as I avoided as much damage as possible (THAT MEANS NOT TAKING PYLONS.) 
---
The level 300 tried and I give him mad props for it.. But there was a third person doing slim to nothing and you're here on a reddit post, that I posted to offer some advice/help, giving me heat because I couldnt take even ONE pylon without being useless to the team. I need those stims outside of events, I have my own things I need to do to. 
---
If you want me to admit I was a little unprepared, it wasnt like I had been hiding the fact that I wasnt taking the pylons, I've mentioned it under multiple comments I've replied to. But I wasnt just sitting around and not doing anything, I was keeping the only other 2 people there from getting shot and blown up by other enemies that spawn during that event. That was my contribution because it was ALL I COULD contribute. I didnt even think about dropping a nuke before starting Encryptid, but with the way Encryptid went, starting a nuke would've just been a waste of a keycard too.
---
I shouldnt have to defend myself over something like this, and these kind of comments are so hurtful. I was trying my best. I dont act like I'm the greatest fallout player. I wanted to offer advice to others who might not know.
---
Edit: I needed a place to express the feelings I had instead of just being angry over a keycard. Now I feel like this post is just a place for people to be angry at me, and that makes me want to delete it.
---
Well. I‚Äôm a dumbass lol. Yeah. I forgot I had a wanted of 10 since I unlocked a door after I got loaded into someone‚Äôs house and someone just killed me. Now it‚Äôs showing up. I‚Äôll show myself out lol
---
Depends how much effort you want to put in.
---
The AFK free kill: load into the lobby, then go do something else. The game will spawn you somewhere, and you may survive for a few minutes before dying which will earn some XP.
---
The low effort bush wookie: Load into the lobby, get to deployment screen. Choose somewhere in the center of the map. Hide in the nearest bush. Go do something else
---
Bush wookie: As above, but actually keep an eye on the game and move if not in the zone. Perfect if watching netflix on another monitor.
---
Try hard bush wookie: as above, but make an attempt to get a gun. You might get a kill at the last minute, or at least get to shoot that scorch beast.
---
Git gud: Just try playing normally - join a team, spawn where they do, try to stick together. You'll eventually get better and gain an understanding of what to do
---
I mean all weapons should have skins it is just just weird they started with this one instead of say pipe weapons?
---
Man I wanted the Mothman hunter outfit....
---
Ah ok. Thanks. I‚Äôm by a cliff (not off a cliff) and don‚Äôt want him to plummet or glitch down it.
---
Meanwhile one of the most popular weapons in the game, The Fixer, does not have a skin.
---
This is why I always buy every gamma round I see. I need something to spend my caps on and the lows always sell these for like 50c a pop. Makes me feel like a whale spreading it around and I have a pocket full of D-cells for my gamma.
---
It was 100 for me... interestingly.
---
Yes! And finally after a year, I enjoy participating in events. I have gained 10+ levels since the public teams lauched.
---
you don't... have to finish the run, you know. don't spend real money if you feel bad about it. ignore fomo. you're literally missing nothing but skins that you'll pay no attention to. treat it as a bit of fun and extra reward for daily challenges and learn not to worry about these things. as long as you got the ammo converter you already got the most valuable reward (once the interface has been spruced up a bit, of course).
---
I don't have a tent so this is a great solution for me.
---
For sure. plus dodgy, sentinel or cav+ assassin's armor... If you don't have a pvp specific build you have no chance.
---
Agreed, looks edible.
---
You're welcome to camp hop whenever you want!
---
Or Raidering up a CAMP, as though you took a pre-existing structure and slapped some defenses on it.
---
I got the rose one every time I started as well until I finished that quest. It made me really want to do it quick because I find her really annoying. As for the status stuff that‚Äôs just always around. You can sprint and everything normally. What drives me crazy when I first get into the game is how long it takes to bring up your quest markers in the corner and on the map so it takes me awhile to see where I‚Äôm trying to go in the beginning
---
I too get upset when I don't get what I think I deserve.
---
Wow. Didn‚Äôt know that!
---
Yeah I figured I put the wrong amount
---
Very true and to be fair I do have about 6500 banked atoms anyway :)
---
All weapons should have skins! Yes!
---
I want Clean Pipe weapon skins and camo pipe weapon skins.
---
Let's not forget about the .45 smg either! That guns needs skins too.
---
But everything about Fallout is very USA-centric. Vault-Tec, the robots, FEV (which is the real reason for most of the weird mutated creatures), the 50‚Äôs aesthetic, the energy weapons, the power armor. All of that is US-only, and given how xenophobic the pre-war US was, they weren‚Äôt gonna give the secrets of portable fusion power (which is what allowed robots, energy weapons, power armor, etc, to exist) to any other country.
---
Manage your space better
---
Ok but what about the monorail elevator....?
---
Firecracker Berry Juice &amp; Ballistic Bock are in my lunch box for rifle builds. The latter isn't exactly Herbivore but does play nice with the mutation.
---
I did that a lot for some time. And realized I had to be more respectful to others. So now, I try to stick with the team with the most diverse location points on the map.
---
The funny thing is, not only have I played it before, Bethesda actually reached out to me to include a quote of mine for future promotion of Fallout 76. The one good thing I said was nestled in a lot of bad but boy, they found it! lol
---
Unfortunately, that probably won‚Äôt be the case. Most of the devs are working on Starfield. It seems this game was intended as filler until the release of the next gen titles. That it happened to be Fallout based really breaks my heart.
---
As if they make anything in the UI easy to notice. There's probably full-blown functionalities I've never even seen because of how they display information.
---
I had someone try to get me and serendipity saved me. So I clipped into his house without getting wanted and started running around and he was pissed he couldn't get me out lol
---
Nope,not for me at least  :/
---
Honestly there is getting to be too many currency types. They need to rework the whole system so that any currency based reward gives a type of token or ticket that can be exchanged for any of the currency types in game. That way players can choose between what currency rewards they need
---
ditto
---
Made my day
---
No prob! There's no wrong way to play the game.
---
I have a solid assortment of plans and recipes but popular/rare go quick. If you're on PC DM me, might have something you need.
---
You're welcome.
---
&gt; I mean all weapons should have skins it is just just weird they started with this one instead of say pipe weapons?
---
Nah, older muzzle loaders look dope already, but could benefit from a skin. Pipe rifles? Eh. Other than black, what're they gonna do? Paint em red white and blue?
---
Thanks thats good to know. I'm teleworking rn and learning all this is making it hard not to say fuck work and cut the game on lol
---
I feel if they did this, they would have to make some weeklies a bit more challenging. Or, like the NW rewards, you can only start earning towards one once the previous one is done.
---
I could see something like this working if, as the season progressed, the weeklies became more challenging while giving more SCORE. So instead of leveling up 3 times (which during a grind, you can do in a day), it is level up 10 times. 
---
Note: I am not suggesting going back to the ridiculous challenges we had before, like take a picture of a player under level 76 chewing gum and under the affects of alcohol, wearing a halloween costume and welding a bone hammer, in the wendigo cave next to a mirelurk king during the night time. They should still be achievable through normal gameplay, but take more time (and thus a larger reward).
---
Well like it or not Fortnite has changed the gaming landscape.  Now almost every live service has a variation of the battle pass.
---
Its imo only worth on weapons with a lengthy reload, like anything heavy, or the black powder weapons.
---
Did you see me complaining about not getting the points? I dislike that they're blatantly trying to promote the mode through the daily and weekly challenges.
---
It kind of amazes me that almost two years after-the-fact, no one at Bethesda thought, "You know, let's just have the Fat Man do ridiculous damage."
---
I mean, it's super heavy.  The ammo is heavy.  It's slow as hell.  It requires a large space to work with.  It's all very situational already.  Why not make it super powerful?  The drawbacks alone would prevent a lot of people from using it anyway.
---
Same with the Missile Launcher.  No one uses this.  Anyone who has, I'm sure, is immediately disappointed in it.  Change the numbers.  Is it really that hard?
---
I counter the need for stims with adamantium skeleton. Still need em every once in a while but it definitely helps with the crippling.
---
I'm addicted to Fallout. They have it easy.
---
I know you are!
---
Smh
---
A custom skin for the dragon is slightly better than one for the Rolling Pin.  If one for the Rolling Pin does come out, we will know for sure their trolling üòÇ
---
Half the time when I try and tab right it never works anyway lol
---
I mean I use pretty uncommon weapons and I would love skins for them, Western Revolver, Gamma Gun, Black Powder Pistol, Laser Pistol, but the Dragon is even more uncommon to use? 
---
You would also think they would've brought out skins for the pipe weapons, given most people will use those at the start?
---
If [ESO on Steam](https://steamdb.info/app/306130/graphs/) is anything to go by, it could be more of a gradual increase over years, helped by continued updates (One Wasteland and Fractured Steel already announced). And since FO5 is probably a very long way off, many people who refused to play 76 until now will eventually pick the game up as it receives more content, and when it is often on sale at a low price (ESO base game is $10 nowadays when discounted, yet it was still [top 12 on Steam by revenue in 2019](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/2019_top_sellers) with the Crown store and subscriptions).
---
U had crazy range with the gauss shotgun back when it did the zero VATS thing..made bloodied sniper builds look like they were shooting BB guns.
---
Well that's good. Should help people get back on pace or even ahead of it.
---
My favorite Legendary Farms:
---
Uranium Fever (guaranteed 3 Legendaries)
---
West Tek Research Center (Lots of caps from mutants and plastic from scrapped energy weapons as well)
---
Whitesprings Resort (Fast travel to the golf club, clear it, and then work your way around the boardwalks)
---
And where to buy one?
---
I'm waiting impatiently for the bone skin to come back so my cultist character can pretty up her excavator
---
Scrapbox? Gotta subscribe to Fallout 1st. Monthly subscription.
---
I've got a single action revovler with it. If this were a trad mmo you could tank a boss fight with that thing.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, makes the progress way easier.
---
Lvl 2 to 3. And 3 to 4 next day. Sad but convenient.
---
10 minutes later... I accidentally scrapped all my legendaries .. Beth sucks
---
Were you around for the Grafton Mayor bug or the Sentrybot Bug? Talk about annoying.
---
That makes sense. You could probably even use it as a shield in that scenario, with a well timed reload.
---
I use the farming methods mentioned above but place my travel tent just off the nuke zone by the clubhouse. Hit the clubhouse,  work your way around the north side houses and then fast travel to the tent. Unload, scrap and stash everything. log out to menu and log back in. Repeat. I've also found its quicker to just grab all the loot off the ghouls and just drop the glowing blood, irradiated meat and other junk at the tent. Gives you a lot of rare junk for your scrapbox and saves time going through enemy inventory.
---
Good to know.  Time to go find those key fragments.  Also, the crippled status actually cripples me for about 30-60 seconds, but it seems like it goes back to normal once all of my CAMP loads (and I have a very simple CAMP).
---
I'm. New level 9 if you wanna play add me xsopie
---
Not gonna lie I left the server once when someone was at my camp. Was tired and hungry and then came back and looked at the map and just logged out after not seeing events and opting to sleep. I don't check my notifications or clear them but the guy at my camp wanted to buy my bloodied meat hook (was max level), had swing speed and +str too and was a max cap item. I unlisted it and kept it wondering if I was on crack or drinking when I listed it haha!
---
Worse of all it was when the vendors were disabled too. I'm sure that player must've died a bit to see my camp log off. I could probably message them too but too much effort and I'm a semi filthy casual.
---
At the very least, it should just ignore all damage resistances on enemies. The stated damage is often quite high, especially with Demolition Expert, but you never actually do that much so it's quite underwhelming.
---
Aye. This. 
---
It's even good on a lever action.
---
I have a bloody one...don't run a bloody character. Would kill for a useful trait on it like E or Instigating.
---
This. I moved my camp underground just to protect my reactor and decom shower. I couldnt imagin the repair bill, and im not going to try.
---
How did you buy it with caps?
---
It's broken on pipe weapons for me. 95% at point blank rage and five shots miss. Go out of VATS and back in and then it works fine. Just a huge pain to keep going in and out of VATS when it doesn't work
---
No complaints here.
---
We need many more iconic event plans.
---
Oops. Meant atoms, too many currencies to keep up with nowadays
---
As an explosive build I carry explosive bait on me incase there's one prick on the server who realllllllllly needs it.
---
Everything comes back eventually!
---
Oh damnnnnnnn. Ok yeah so I see what you mean now lmaoo
---
Well, then don't do it daily? I mean, Obviously if you're actually addicted, then that's a bigger problem, but I can go on a public server, and get all the score done in an hour, hour and a half, still having the fun of doing it where people actually are.
---
When you face them down from the roof, they trap and hold you and kill you in a few seconds. Not instant, but close enough you cant do anything about it.
---
If you wanna play with a newbie too xsopie
---
I think they will come back. Just a strategy to make you miss them, only to make people want/buy them even faster when they come out.
---
Just a thought tho
---
Second! I hate going into there during nukes and then doing the "running towards mob, *falls*, tries to get back to ground succeed and then fall again. 
---
There are players who actively watch for punji boards at vendor camps and then there's players who just get stressed about not moving into a trench during a scorched hunt.
---
they can release each  dlc as a 20 years advance in time. with new seasons.
---
I need a responders backpack for my police officer.
---
Traveling the wasteland arresting super mutants with extreme prejudice.
---
Awesome! There is more solutions than I thought too, check some of the comments on here :)
---
I will admit I had a bunch of fun during XP weekend in public. Somebody dropped 3 SBQ nukes in a row. Granted I have more free time on weekends though. I feel like if I walk away now I‚Äôll hate it because I‚Äôm almost halfway through the board. Maybe after this season is over and I see how little I have to show for it, I‚Äôll learn my lesson.
---
Also I‚Äôm hoping once I buy all the things I want with gold I‚Äôll stop that grind. Like I did with Mr Fuzzy now that I got the costume. Even though I still visit there since those events are easy decent XP. I don‚Äôt plan to buy all the gold stuff either. I think I just want to get the new PA and mods I like and then farmable tiles. Got the other stuff I wanted. Listen to me making excuses fml.
---
You might want to reconsider getting this angry over some rando using a relatively innoceous selfbuilt trap in a post apocalyptic game to kill people lured in by trade.
---
Too much shit being added to the atom shop and not enough shit being put in the **actual game**.
---
Aged, looks edible.
---
Maybe... Double XP week. Win-win.
---
The pale rider one is excellent if you have the chance to get it.
---
I know, but it's just a game, they could have done something imaginative with the area, maybe the Aliens take it and the robots over for their own nefarious ways?
---
Not to mention that there's no good way to share stuff between characters.
---
I can't play in pa but that no fall damage =\] Nice moves
---
Well, we can exchange caps for Bullion already, but this wouldn't be a terrible idea otherwise.
---
Is the red medical backpack not on the store now? That‚Äôs the one I use, I love it!
---
&gt;Other than black, what're they gonna do? Paint em red white and blue?
---
Sure, or raider themed, or some blood eagle red stuff, whatever. They need to add a way to favorite items so they don't get scripped or dropped, but until then they need to add skins for everything as a means of avoiding it.
---
this deters me from wanting to play the game. do not call it a double score weekend if all the challenges are not doubled. getting really sick of bethesda's bullshit
---
https://imgur.com/a/bddcPN0
---
Join public teams
---
Maybe 5 is minimum. Honestly it‚Äôs not that bad compared to 9
---
Yeah I wish this were a thing. At my camp I basically used the golden board wallpaper as the outside but used the wall that has white wood panels as the interior Soni basically reversed my walls orientation. That alone sucked orientating a few times especially when you change the direction of the wall again...
---
But if you ever see my camp near flat woods it has the golden bird wallpaper staring at you if you're looking at it from the front of the camp.
---
I'd be so salty. I couldn't imagine how many resources it would cost me to rebuild.
---
The Copper. Jesus the Copper.
---
So making him harmless like a radroach is a good thing?
---
Awesome, thanks! TIL!
---
Join me...I'm jadarad247
---
I have heard that too. Kind of a big debuff for healing factor imo :(
---
some people say yes, some people say no. personally I believe sneak is tied to your connection and how laggy the game is. even with 35+ agility, all relevant perks, mutations and legendaries, I can barely keep caution.
---
escape artist essentially nullifies the noise from heavy armor though, and puts you back in caution if you're found. so I'd recommend it regardless.
---
It seems to be working now. I tried logging out then back in but that had no effect. So I tried completely restarting the XBox and that seems to have done the trick.
---
What happened to the picture?
---
Im probably not of the majority since i main black powder weapons but im super happy to have a skin for my dragon. I had just enough saved up atoms to get it.
---
If you can grind your way to level 40 (or maybe it's 42) there's a pink donut with sprinkles skin that actually looks pretty good on the excavator.
---
It worries me that the foundation the game is built on is so unsound so as to allow these constant bugs to resurface or new ones to appear with each patch.
---
Misc. Structures?
---
All of the weekend challenges will be doubled. Not sure what you're upset about.
---
He is always behind Big Freds BBQ shack I thought.
---
It's better than seeing "d697b2a8184b9524f96847e507064940a has joined the group"
---
Nice, I can save up atoms for next week.
---
I would suggest Sweet mutfruit tea as mentioned elsewhere. It's arguably easier to create and lasts 60 min instead of 30 (IIRC)
---
I lost 4 weeklies and 5 dailies. Can we trade?? 5250 owed for this week
---
you forgot Brotherhood script and Enclave requisitions for the next two story expansions, 
---
lets be blunt I cant think of another company that does anything like that. the reason developers PUT new alternate currency's in mmos of any kind is to make you play the content. they don't want people who have been farming old content for years because its gotten easy(For example the WoW the old still obtainable currency's from Dranor are a simple "spam AOE while running" to get) to just walk up and pay for everything the first day, while new players have a month or more of game time to even get to the new content.
---
How do you kill that which has no life ...?
---
What a korean random this pie feature is. Do you think after you got your first pie, the chance to get new one increases?
---
It‚Äôs not really random, he‚Äôs part of a sheepsquatch side quest
---
I'm really surprised we didn't get a cool new event, even a limited time one like Fasnacht -- something actually Captain Cosmos related. Imagine an event where you battle aliens, robots, etc for some classic 50s sci fi fun that fits the theme of the board game. Instead... it's just the grind. Doesn't next season supposedly have new story content or something?
---
Do you stay logged in the whole day? :D
---
It‚Äôs too exploitable
---
So is trying to remember a large inventory. now that I‚Äôve done inventory...
---
I have partial plan set for raider, complete plan sets for both T45 and T51, as well as a large number of mods and Mod plans for all 3
---
I thought in the mix, I alos had several  t60s, but I must have been thinking Of the T51 stuff
---
I have T60 emergency protocols.
---
Ah, yes. I forget about that one. Good suggestion.
---
Oh that gives me nostalgia fighting (and killing) legandaries while low level is so satisfying
---
P. S. I fought the imposter sheepsquatch and the encryptid sheepsquatch in the same day without my knowledge while below level 50 (like 25 or so) with help ofcourse
---
I think like clothes shouldn't have shine on them. It looks really bad. Things like the plastic vault boy and girl head look better imo.
---
Maybe I have an old driver too cause the photos taken by that girl on beth website look nothing like mine. She has sharpening turned up or something. I run max dof too.
---
I've seen a large blue backpack with lots of pouches that had the responders markings on it - been hoping for that one.
---
Sugar Grove (junk, XP), West Tek(legendaries, junk, XP). Watago High School (chems plastic) walk the road right side of the map from Freddie's fear house N all the way down to fissure sight prime S. You'll find plenty of loot legendaries and Adventure.
---
Thanks for the advice. I know a lot of these are boosted by bloodied/junkie‚Äôs build but do you think I could build a tank character w/o searching for these?
---
I'm not the only one who does this xD?
---
I die everytime though heh
---
Apparently half the people commenting do it
---
Thats what New Vegas was intended to be, third party dev filler until Bethesda completed its next dev cycle. Then people started liking it more than Bethesda's in house titles, and someone got a bit butt hurt.....
---
I thought I learned my lesson from fallout 4's settlements and nope..didn't..
---
The only and BIGGEST complaint about camps is that if you get a ton of the challenges done for atoms and use.tem accordingly there's just no absolute way to show it at all and it kind of is depressing. The cabin, glass some, Red Rocket and silver camper would just eat tons of camp build already! I wish they just paid for the extra servers and additional programming to increase the camp size to address this. I don't even know how I'm supposed to incorporate anything from Slocum Joe's without removing other stuff and that Grognak Throne chair is NOT going anywhere!
---
Yeah... it was better when the animated cards were worth 5/10/15 etc. But people had to complain that they wanted to keep their animated cards so we lost that.
---
Hopefully they either go back, or make cards worth 3 points per level or something so it's not so bad.
---
True but I‚Äôm also looking for convenience
---
Yea the mission is clearly cursed. Either way, great photo!
---
It appears to work yes but I will have a proper investigation later - I'm sure it boosts my stats no matter where I am on the map
---
I keep hoping that subsequent seasons aren't like this one, i.e. just doing challenges.
---
Logged off 2 hours before. Waited till 20 mins after. Still lost 3500 score
---
I need it! Or at least a couple more cat things. There's a red &amp; gold chair that is very similar to one my family actually had that my cats lived before we sadly had to get rid of it once it got too old &amp; worn so I'd like to digitally recreate that haha
---
Just go in when the event isn't on. Interesting place to explore.
---
Melee or shotgun perks are your best bet. You can't save levels for later (ie you need to spend 30 points to unlock level 30 perk cards) so you just need to get your special in the right place, and level everything you can get before hand
---
So what do daily challenges reward after you reach the end? Nothing? Atoms?
---
(and full disclosure, my pet was Insta murdering things so quickly I was having trouble keeping up with her
---
I think my friends list doubled since I started playing. I also feel like im talking to myself, but i keep the mic on and keep talking like they can hear me. If nothing else, it keeps me in the environment insteqd of using my ohone to send messages or trying like hell to use the wheel to find an emote for "stay there and ill bring the mob to you". Add me if you want to adventuretogether.
---
Great ideas. Protecting the atlas observatory from a bunch of protectrons would have been awesome!!
---
Yeah. I only run junkies because it has a really good damage boost for literally no hindrance to my gameplay. I can send you a reddit post that outlines why there‚Äôs no downside to having junkies. On top of that, bloodied builds don‚Äôt normally run PA because they don‚Äôt get many of their effects from perk cards like serendipity. Also bloodied usually aren‚Äôt tanks because their health is so low. If you wanted to avoid those you would just use any weapons you could find I‚Äôd assume. That‚Äôs another reason I took junkies, so that I could just get rid of everything else because yo until that point I had been hoarding, never knowing what I wanted to use, and my storage space was stuck full
---
Like a camp storage system. Where you can cycle your camps and the next time you log in the one you selected in the previous session will spawn in. I like that idea. I'm sitting here wishing I could hve more than 5 characters, but I'd definitely settle for that.
---
I'd really like to build a town with other players who are good at building but I dont know many people who play, and even fewer who match my camp building skills. If I did know some master builders I bet we could make something really awesome. I'd have to try to rebuild my shop and inn in said town. Or my church, house and shack. I still need to fill the house and shack though, that's a project put on hold because the character didn't have the plans I needed though. Lol
---
I play about 12-20 hours a day I able.
---
Does the Hunting Lodge Chair give you the well rested bonus?
---
Yea it‚Äôs like their only way to ‚Äòbalance‚Äô is to dial the damage number down and nothing else. Sure it‚Äôs the easiest way and cost them nothing, but it‚Äôs just ridiculous for a much hyped iconic fatman only do fart damage to the endgame boss while blinding the view of other players.
---
People loved that game because Bethesda turned it over to Obsidian, the original developers of the Fallout franchise. I think it‚Äôs the best console Fallout of all of them.
---
This happened to me just recently as well, although he didn‚Äôt want my gifts of ammo so eventually he just ran out and gave up.
---
His is not as frequent and slightly a little more humorous, plus he doesn‚Äôt play an annoying instrument badly
---
Honestly it's funny that you probably suck so bad at pvp that you have to "bait" level 15s into it so that you can kill them and steal their early game loot. Can't get much more sad than that.
---
Sorry to hear that... Hope they find a way to compensate this problem .... and hope that this problem fixed before their score√ó2 event...
---
Well at least tonight I will have a long sleep for a day... (A resettime on my side is at 11 p.m.)
---
Yeah that was absurdly low, doesn‚Äôt mean 800 is ok.
---
Radiation and DoTs like burning and poison. From what I can tell all 3 of those bypass serendipity, ricochet and fireproof. I could be incorrect on the latter. Love the build, but it does have its weaknesses.
---
I like the Prime Gauss Minigun for SBQ fights then once you max Settler rep definitely get the Gauss Shotgun
---
I have a legacy flamethrower and it definitely dishes out damage. The only downside is ammo &amp; my weapon durability.
---
I haven't calculated the amount of fuel I use before it breaks, but I'd say about 600 or 700. This happens with many heavy weapons though I believe,even with gunsmith on and artisan.
---
Anyways it would be a bad idea to remove them or change them in my opinion. So if they do anything at all, they should just change their ammo type or something similar. I don't encourage this idea at all, only suggesting a possible alternative to outright removing them. It will still be like a punishment for having a legacy, but in a way it would be a better balance solution than removing them.
---
People will mainly use them for sbq or hard enemies,due to the ammo scarcity and want to save it. I mainly use mine on lvl 68 enemies and bosses, since I found someone with a lot of material to make fuel. It was costly, but worth it since it was double XP weekend a few days ago.
---
Of course people who duplicate stuff can just duplicate the ammo for the guns,but that's a whole other subject. If they were to just remove them something would surely just take their place for people to hate and love. Best to just keep them in the game,they're not the most powerful weapons. Hell I think some melee builds are still stronger than most things.
---
I spend it on SS armor. But now i lose all my scrip on legendary modules for the perfect SS Uny armor.
---
Same!
---
Daily Challenges don't give anything themselves, they award S.C.O.R.E.
---
It's winter and cold AF right now though :(
---
Even the rabbit plush from the deathclaw eggs?
---
I went for melee and I still use my melee perks as I switch between a super sledge and a mini gun now that I‚Äôm higher level
---
I would submit a ticket still. I asked for atoms but I doubt they will give anything. But worth a shot.
---
Yup, that sounds like Todd.
---
Good fucking god.
---
They should have given the atoms they were giving AND score points, buy no.
---
Yeah i want the sheepsqautch head but not that bad. Lots of old stuff again as well.
---
Noob question inc: how does one get the dragon? It can drop from the legendary pool but do you need the plans for it first?
---
Yeah or balance the weapons in more creative ways, how about Ordinance Express applies to other explosives but not the Fatman, but give Fatman more power in queen battles. So realistically you can‚Äôt spam fatman because you can‚Äôt carry much ammo, but when it hits it counts.
---
Riding Shotgun event will give you a 1-3* Legendary enemy at a minimum and occasionally others. Most I've gotten in one run is 4. Event usually takes less than 20 minutes.
---
500? Too much, no thanks
---
the fact the week challenges will not be. where the actual score is located
---
And trying to 'scrip' 25 left legs in weeks combined with other legendary's
---
But I haven‚Äôt done that quest
---
I thought about both of those, but I'm spec'd for rifles, lol, I only have an unmodified str of 1, kinda useless on the mini gun and shotgun. Thanks though. :)
---
Definitely, I dont generally use purifiers, and I try to limit my turrets to 4 if I can. Collections aren't too bad so I keep one, workbenches can hurt pretty bad, so I often don't build a distillery. If you know where the enemies generally spawn, you can often place turrets only on that side. For instance I only have enemies spawn to one side of my main camp, and for whatever reason on the roof of my camp, so I only have them on the roof and one in the road turned towards the raiders down the road.
---
I could get it done in public. Takes me about the same time as you. It‚Äôs the distractions that might pop up to slow that process down. But lately I‚Äôve been saving any group related ones last so then I can mess around on the public server and see what happens and decide when to leave. But still the same issue applies of me spending all my play time on this damn game. So it‚Äôs like ok maybe get it done, get out and on to something else. But never happens that way. Which wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing if I was just on there not giving a crap about score, completions, gold, etc., and could focus on just having fun. And I guess I shouldn‚Äôt want to just ‚Äúdo my chores‚Äù and get off the game in the first place. I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a dumb cycle and balance and really sad the more I think about it.
---
Idk where I was lol
---
U really use those?
---
If it was called "Double Score Week," you'd have a point.
---
Camping in a bush is the easiest and quickest way, but if you're worried about letting down teammates by doing so, just deselect team autofill option before joining. Unfortunately, it must be done again before each match.
---
Or make it so that level 15 victim of yours gets a random legendary item from your inventory.
---
How good is the SS armor? I'm wearing a hodgepodge that's all unyielding, and have pretty decent resists.
---
Not possible.
---
I believe it‚Äôs on floor decor
---
I love the breakdown. I tend to bounce around between the first tree depending on how much stuff I have to do.
---
Same! I'd always had stash boxes *in the general vicinity* of my vendors also (closer to workbenches, most of which I include outside so folks don't have to explore if they don't want to) but after enough of these posts I put a dedicated one closer to the vendors instead.
---
I usually have this need to keep rebuilding my camp but I actually like this one enough to not want to start again.
---
If you're not having fun doing SCORE things, seriously, just stop. Unless there's something specific you're aiming for on the LR down the line, just don't focus on SCORE things. Maybe you'll get a bit of score, maybe you won't, but if you just focus on what you enjoy in the game anyway, do that instead.
---
I would but my mic broke so unless you are able to talk on discord or snap or insta we wouldn't be able to talk
---
Lol, why not?
---
Yeh this Double XP weekend seemed cooler than most...maybe it was the public teams, lunchboxes or just everybody sharing a common goal (trying to get a little more up the run).
---
My team dropped three nukes in a row several times this weekend. We would get the silos hot, jump servers and do it all over again...so if you are on PC we probably fought the SQB side by side with you.
---
You might like the Secret Service armour+mods, ammo factory, and either the food or chem backpack mods.
---
Scrapbox. I can't play without it. And bandolier, I couldn't play without that, either. It's easier just to keep all my ammo on me than in my stash.
---
 Had the same problem relogged and found more but they are all auto completed.  Made sure to log off for reset but didn't seem to matter.
---
Where's the fun in that? The excitement comes from watching that claw actually grab the plate!
---
I nearly fell out of my chair the first time I got a pie from the machine at top of the world.
---
Good! 
---
The wording is confusing though. Are we getting 2 bonus challenges? Or 4 for a total of 9? Because today I had 9 challenges.
---
I think you‚Äôre right. Thanks! I guess I didn‚Äôt notice it when I was a tanky build. You really feel the hit of that 25 HP on bloodied
---
This tells ya the owner of the atom shop is either utter clueless or hates money.
---
Well now I know I'm somewhere between try hard bush wookie and a git gud! This is good to know! Happy Cake Day, btw!
---
For real! I love decking out my camp with beds and shelters near Flatwoods it gives me joy to see a new player get some supplies and live in my camp for a bit
---
It sux because in stealth you want to asses the situation and maybe vats shoot. But in PA stealth your AP will drain
---
This. I use a .50 machine gun with 250DR on reload when fighting the queen and her various minions. Health getting too low? Hit the reload and during that looooong reload time open the pipboy, take a radaway and stimpack, close the pipboy and bam! back to full health by the time I'm done reloading.
---
Was the last mode you played NW before the reset? If so, that messes it up as well.
---
"You beautiful cunt" -Billy Butcher
---
And silt beans are at Foundation garden.
---
I don‚Äôt know if they ‚Äúdestroys‚Äù the thing or if the base has to be destroyed. I thought he had to explore and then come back and deliver.
---
Nah it was on Xbox but it‚Äôs funny I was fighting side by side with another redditor on here. It was good times. That was definitely the most fun I‚Äôve had for double XP. The public groups are pretty cool too. I just need to not focus on the grind as much but easier said than done.
---
Really happy to hear that, having options to get the gold star is nice.
---
I‚Äôm on my fourth character, it usually takes me to 250-300 to get a build I like, the 4th just hit 140 and pushing on...
---
I sort of regret not sticking to 1 character
---
now that makes more sense. should be a bigger, more formal announcement, but this should be more of a relief for those fucked by the autocompletion bug.
---
Did someone call the batman?! ...no wait it's the mothman?
---
It looks like the bat symbol and batman jumping across the sky. Now we need a new WV superhero, the mothman! No not the one who makes bridges fall, but instead saves Appalachia.
---
Great action shot!
---
Lol you and maybe 50 other people I'm guessing.
---
The no-build zone around other players' camps is a little too big for me to really get that town feel going, but it'd still be pretty rad to see what kinda stuff you could do with some good builders by your side.
---
With the Animal Friend perk at level 3 and at least one level of Wasteland Whisperer (or vise versa) you can tame creatures and have them patrol your camp. I have a deathclaw, the wife had a sloth.
---
You can only tame creatures that appear alone as a random encounter. You aim at them with a gun with no scope an follow the prompt to tame them (triangle button on ps4).
---
I would really suggest using vampire gatling/50cal/laser gat; you'll be nigh invincible with it.
---
It‚Äôs tip top, best armor in the game.
---
The ammo producer seems a no brainer.
---
But what am I?
---
Nope. Played a little earlier, did some crafting, logged off.
---
There's always been turrets, no one ever uses them so i can't remember if they were always laser turrets (though BoS, they probably were)
---
Yeah that‚Äôs how it was getting for me, but I started hating it and myself because that‚Äôs not why I play fallout. There was nothing grindy about fallout up until 76 came out. Sure you COULD grind in the other fallouts but there was no penalty for just playing casually. You can play casually in 76 but then you don‚Äôt get cool stuff that other players grinded for. I wouldn‚Äôt have SS armor or a gauss minigun if I didn‚Äôt mindlessly grind treasury notes but that‚Äôs pretty much when I stopped. I came to the realization that I‚Äôm not gonna get everything in the game so I‚Äôm only focusing on what I want and will absolutely use in game. I don‚Äôt pay attention to score dailies I just get them while I‚Äôm playing and I‚Äôm cool with that. The only thing I grind for is ammunition to keep killing shit because that is the reason I play fallout. I love tearing apart monsters and drinking Nuka cola. And that does get boring too after a while so I try to keep it fresh, talk to other dwellers, do some events, take a step back maybe put away the bloodied weapons for a bit and just help out some low levels in the forest. That‚Äôs my end game for now at least and I love it. No more rushing and hurrying up to get my dailies done so I can do other stuff or just get off, that‚Äôs really depressing but I understand some people have to play that way I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. Fallout to me is a fun game, not a background mobile grinder or something. If you‚Äôre at the end game just getting on grinding for notes, scrip, caps and score, unless you just enjoy a horrible grind, it‚Äôs probably time to pick up a new game because you will never get back to the enjoyment you initially had playing this game. They well never release enough content at one time to keep any of us busy for more than a couple weeks at best. I have a full time job and still finished wastelanders casually playing in maybe a week. So yeah, unless you drop the grind and just play casually sort of how I am, you‚Äôll never be done grinding and that‚Äôs exactly what bethesda wants. 
---
Everything in moderation, just sprinkle in some grinding here and there, don‚Äôt overdo it.
---
I've stopped using them until this is fixed. It's either that or avoiding all public events while buffed, which is ridiculous.
---
Superhero landing
---
Yeah I wish the space was smaller, but you could still get a good set of houses and businesses down a single road, it would fit very nicely on a road where its flat on one side and filled with objects or a hill on the other
---
I do it usually, I do a complete  round and changue character, and depend What fluxs you farm, You Can Do 7 or 9 round and get 150-200 flux per nuke.
---
Ahhh obviusly before changue character go to My csmp and craft the fluxs
---
if you hit the sercret level 200 S.C.O.R.E. You will unlock Skyrim for the pipboy. it is a hidden feature from Todd
---
Has he tried logging in and out?
---
No, I have seen them since the game started, they just aren't always there
---
Huh. It doesn‚Äôt count against stash weight, right? Even if, that‚Äôs good to know.
---
I also have a pretty decent set of uny armor but from what i read here, SS has the best DR. 
---
(and it gives me some things to look out for)
---
I sit mainly on 28000+ caps almost all the time except the few days after I buy those bullion for 6k, so I mostly don't care about trave cost I would say...
---
lol true. I mean idk how easy it would be to fix honestly in terms of coding. In theory, it should be easy to have matchmaking start the game only when all parties are loaded in
---
I have it on my main explosive executioners handmade. I use a smaller clip - the one with armor piercing because I know when I reload I‚Äôm actually safer.
---
It's good for a niche PvP, not for anything else. You'll lose stealth while moving and most of the mooks will magically see you anyway.
---
Looks great
---
I believe that is the only group perk or mutation that will apply even if you are in a group all by yourself.  All the other need to actually have other members, but even those don't care where those members are
---
I think some of these new players are paranoid about the dupe ban. They probably think a donation of 50.stims and 500 ammo is duped.  I've had alot of players deny my donations.
---
They've been there, however it seems not always. Could've sworn one time they weren't as I usually repair a few to hold a side.
---
Hey herb. Omni over hear.
---
Psa: rad x suppresses mutations like herbivore. Take one, if you have cannibal card equip that. Eat all the meat. Then take a rad x deluded. It doesnt suppress mutations, and regular and deluded dont stack. Ie suppress eat unsuppress. :)
---
Well, that settles it - I‚Äôm using one of my alts for the level up challenges, my main characters base int of over twenty aside. Thanks for the info!
---
I just went through this, and the only thing I can suggest is pick a melee weapon, and take a bunch of QoL perks until then. I spent hours at the Nukes n Dragons site playing with the perks, and I'll put a link to the page at the bottom. I'm now lvl 95 and maybe 75% finished my build. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I see you've accidentally added an extra 0 onto the end of that 5.
---
Haha yes, you can‚Äôt just drop it.
---
I have more treasury notes than I could turn in within a week and I doubt they're causing the same amount of server stress as people holding on to 20 1Star  weapons. this seems like a reasonable and easy to implement fix.
---
Which, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, is also against Zenimax TOS once you‚Äôve been suspended or banned.
---
That's only happening to steam players due to some bug that's adding the atoms to their Bethesda account rather than the steam copy of the game. Neither of the consoles is affected, nor are people who play exclusively on the Beth launcher.
---
They've always been there. The idea of the event is you're suppose to fix all the defenses but no-one ever bothers. It's funny to see the place straight after a server reset when everything is fixed as you don't realise how many walls and blockades are there but blown up.
---
He already tried. It suddenly did not help.
---
If I remember the pie machine is based on luck skill but even having it high isn‚Äôt making the chances more frequent...at least in the previous games that‚Äôs the case
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I wish they could do the score in a way that is more natural. Where combinations of things just give you score as you play and no set challenges to feel the need to complete. Like XP, enemies killed, events done, etc. all in some kind of invisible formula. Then I‚Äôd just got piss around in public and see what happens.
---
The double score dailies this weekend will help considerably.
---
Yes it is.
---
I do this too but haven't done that event in at least a week I think.
---
The Deathclaw and Cat were both bugged items that could be placed without buying them. Once fixed any you had placed you could keep, but you couldn't place more.
---
Just checking but did you 100% purchase them and didn't happen to have them due to the the bug?
---
If so i guess contact support.
---
What difference will this x2 bonus and extra challenges do if they're auto completed and won't reward them anyways?
---
I mean, every town is dead except Crater and Foundation, really.
---
I asked for atoms too. Got the canned response I expected lmao
---
Im a little unsure what The picture shows?
---
That's why I currently have to waste my last alt slot for an alt to create, level up and then delete for when I haven't the time for such a chore.
---
(Some caution if you do that too)
---
I have to be extra careful when deleting him cuz that same bug where when you're selling stuff and the amount bar is up and you move your cursor to it the highlight scrolls to another item... and confirming it will sell the wrong thing...  well character menu does that too while you're typing in the name. So it'll be highlighting a different character while you're confirming deletion for the levelup alt. No idea if it'll go through or not cuz of the name difference but this is Bethesda so not taking any chances.
---
Since launch, I've always treated Fallout 76 as being more akin to Minecraft or create your own adventure style games just within a Fallout setting. I play it because that kind of casual play can be really relaxing. I also loved the settlement mechanics and building in Fallout 4, so my drive to get plans, all the plans, and make [cool bases](https://imgur.com/gallery/Iq8l1Zb).
---
Does anyone know which rank one should be at right now in order to hit the max just from doing dailies?
---
Freakin genius! Wish I got that door now...
---
All you need for junkies is an addiction. You don't have to take the drugs you're addicted to.
---
I think the negative effects go away temporarily if you do, but they're so minimal it's not really necessary.
---
So... I don't take drugs or keep a supply.
---
The guys I join will get some extra team boost and I free ft over the hole map. Sounds like a good deal to me haha
---
Jeez I‚Äôve come close to dying in power armor at level 90 against multiple squach spawns very impressed y‚Äôall took them down
---
I had this yesterday, except it was by a level 300+ power armor teddy bear who apparently still didnt grasp how a bloodied build works... I was restocking my vendor, and he was in some type of spastic rush and thought it was a brilliant idea to scratch at my back with a deathclaw gauntlet LOL
---
After the second scratch I exited the vendor, turned around and pulled out my power fist. After a brief hesitation (to allow him to maybe run or something), I popped him in the face. Dead. LOL
---
Last thing I heard in area was "WTF just happened?" LMAO. I even left the loot bag laying there because I couldnt be bothered. It happens...
---
Dude I like your style, those are frickin badass!
---
Sneak will help, but you can go without it for the most part. Escape Artist is still useful though... You will get spotted every now and again and it's nice to be able to go back into stealth without too much trouble .
---
are you seriously saying fallout 76 has better characters than 4 lmao
---
Thanks for the help but Yeah i 100% bought them .
---
Ah I totally forgot the armor right lol
---
Man big talk for someone with a small iq
---
Let us make camps on top of the roofs there. Please Bethesda!
---
Why can't I place this camp item down when it has a green highlight
---
Why does it say "object needs support" for an object that is mounted on walls?
---
Why can't I remove stairs from a prefab foundation slab that all of a sudden now requires those stairs as a "support object"
---
Why do people think another currency for perk coins (for legendary perks) is fine when it should not even be a thing as we already have too many currencies and to level up legendary perks should be completely reworked instead of trying to adjust perk coins
---
There has to be some reward to PVP and in this case it is you might get lucky if you kill someone who's hordibg junk.
---
I'm sure there are some people who absolutely love PVP but if I was a betting man I would say more people like the teamwork and PVE part of Fallout 76 over it's lackluster PvP.
---
Anyway, I don't think your issue is a PVP issue but more of a storage issue.  And I agree with you we are lacking storage. We can easily use an ammo box that can hold all our ammo weightless, FO1st should get more storage, we should have a shared storage between characters, etc...
---
Do you remember what the person was wearing?
---
Sound advice. I envy you.
---
Cranberry bog...never know when a stray scorchbeast will decide you‚Äôre for dinner. Mire is entertaining due to all the aquatic life in my opinion...
---
I leveled as a commando and respecced into heavy guns post level 50. I can't imagine trying to level directly for heavy weapons. But melee seems the most efficient since you don't need to worry about shotgun shells or wasting resources crafting ammo for temporary weapons.
---
Having to reload weapon on every log in.
---
I wouldn't assume they won't fix it. I would assume the resolution is more complex than we think and it takes time. Just like when they did fix the autocomplete issue and it created a new autocomplete issue. Even though its the same outcome, mechanically, the cause is totally different.
---
&gt; I enjoy the public teams a lot
---
I can't say that I necessarily enjoy public teams but will join a builder team simply for the +4 int.  I rarely purposely interact with anyone from my team once I join one.
---
Think the cat topiary was a freebie if I remember right. I got it the same day as the release of the greenhouse bundle.
---
Damn really? Have you tried reinstalling it? That's infuriating. I haven't heard any advice from support in six days now since my last email. Absolutely Insane.
---
Ahh damn that sucks a lot. I feel your pain. This is for me the most annoying bug because I'm always overload lol
---
It doesn't matter. Most things are present in the game at all times. Things like the Son of Fluffy need to be present for other people that may be in the server.
---
The Fall Out 1st subscription. Survival tent, atoms, repair kits. However I guess coukd be a means for those who work more, and can pay more to contend with their time. Sorry was trying to make comparisons from what I've read verses what I've experienced for myself.
---
I am DYING for the Thanksgiving Display. It came out right when I started and my Atoms were basically non-existent.
---
Yeah. It's just we have to find ways to circumvent the tight space we have. So many people hoard their junk. 1 death shouldn't mean all your junk just gets taken. Especially with the guns some people have. It's just not balanced. And yeah, I'm just saying if they want PvP to be more relevant, that can be one way. I'm definitely a PVE teamwork kind of player.
---
As I said, I am working on trying to get that one.
---
Its amazing on a Hunting or Sniper rifle as well for a hidden reason. I haven't tested this in a while, but it still works AFAIK...I haven't seen that it's been patched out.
---
The 250 DR kicks in while reloading AND between shots while the bullet is being chambered. Essentially if you keep shooting and shooting, you have the DR in effect pretty much nonstop. It makes having a sneaky sniper build much more viable...getting mobbed while clearing West Tek? Just keep shooting and shooting.
---
If this has changed, I am sorry for the incorrect information, but I am 99% sure it still is in effect.
---
I only read the title, but I just moved, won't have internet for a week, and I'm already kinda jonesing for some 76. I, too, have work and family commitments, and often end up sacrificing sleep time because I say "only 30 minutes" when I start, and when I realize I've been on for three hours.
---
Reckon that FOMO SCORE system got into my mind and I just gotta have the ghillie paints, even if they're broken.
---
And I moved out to the sticks, so I'm freaking out over the internet being too slow, because "up to 10mbps" is the only option available.
---
uh, underground??
---
All us high level vets also have had dupe cards from packs auto-deleted for hundreds of levels. Is the legendary coin stuff going to compensate that or are they jus' like fuck all the people who actually stuck around so long?
---
Thanks, makes total sense. Let's not put in somewhere like defenses or anything.
---
Finally, I've been waiting for the pallet walls &amp; floors, and I'm really happy they're available separately from the bundle. Speaking of which, are the large succulents available on their own, or are they bundle exclusive? I'd like to have them, but not for 1200 when I have no interest in the other stuff they're bundled with.
---
What about people who are just too good? Can we do something about them lol? 2 members of my team entered a building last night and I heard silenced gunfire and came around the edge of the door about 5 seconds after them. Bang Bang dead too. Solo guy sniped three of us dead in literally 10 seconds. Can somebody find him and put a tiny weight on his thumb to slow him down or something?
---
The Mothman's legs are a wee bit in front of it's eyes, which kinda makes it look like it's got pupils and is looking down.
---
FO76 needs a [googly eye mod](http://www.9minecraft.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GooglyEyes-Mod-Screenshots-19.jpg).  It would be fucking hilarious.
---
yes, those have been back at least twice now
---
A greed, looks develishly
---
We now have 2 extra dailys for the rest of the season, will this be included in the calculator?
---
Thanks so much btw, it's a good piece of mind to have, knowing the legendary run is doable, atleast in my situation.
---
Guess I'm a weirdo cuz I'm going for the strangler power armor.
---
Great. Thanks!!
---
Happened to a lot of people. Commonly referred to as the auto complete bug
---
I missed it first time around and have been waiting for it to come back. Was hoping they would retro it into the greenhouse bundle.
---
I‚Äôm on pathetic 1.2MB DSL. A reinstall takes -literally- 15 hours. I‚Äôve already done it twice at the request of the support guys. lol I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end here.
---
Reminds me of the Dark Knight Returns cover art. Nice shot.
---
If the camp is one of the  ones that requires you to use an instrument to clip through the floor to access it? Chances are it's gonna be a pit at the bottom with punji boards. I've only seen one camp with that kind of entrance that wasn't a trap.
---
leveling a heavy gutter build is a slow and tedious process but God damn when you finally reach the end and you can just walk around like big king dick and kill everything it's the best.
---
Before they do more on PvP, they should upgrade their servers more. I enjoy PvP too, but not when the tick rate is fluctuating.  I'll admit it's funny to see my foe running into a wall for an easy shot sometimes, but it's hard to take it seriously or even factor in who has more experience skill wise or who has a better build.
---
This also applies to a few times I was battling against a quad Tesla gun &amp; a guy who was using either stealth boys or chameleon mutation. I was probably faster on my draw than they were several times, but due to the latency that day he managed to get the shot in first, since my bullets did not register after firing at his face almost point blank. 
---
There should be death match game modes too and free for all. Not just in adventure mode, but also separate like NW.
---
If you run into any of the t60, please comment again or message me. Only ones I need. Torso, legs, left arm. Thanks.
---
Haha me nightly. Ok cool gonna do an hour get these done....3 hours later shit got sidetracked.  Maybe that slower internet will be a blessing in disguise.
---
I don't worry about caps in my pocket because I walk around with over 28k all the time anymore.  I use the teams specifically for the extra experience that comes with +4 int.  Last weekend that extra int plus the double XP, lover's embrace and canned meat stew would cause the repeatable weekly challenge to hit three or four times during each Line in the Sand event.
---
I missed it entirely because I stopped playing for a long time due to glitches. But it both fits my camp better aesthetically and holds more items. I need it for the back bar for Becketts and for my bedroom displays
---
That's how I put my workbenches under my 2x1 staircase until I saw someone else post the blueprint method here. I'm completely maxed out on budget so being able to remove those two rugs was extremely beneficial to me.
---
For me it's filler until Cyberpunk and Shadowlands.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for.üòÇ You‚Äôd recommend just waiting it out then?
---
Explain how you know this when you don't know where foundation even is
---
If I learned anything from all my years of gaming, limited time digital items are false. Companies love money and if they bring back a limited time only item even years after it was supposedly never to return people will buy it and companies will make money.
---
in other words, I'm sure when they release a big update to player housing or instance housing or whatever they will re-release tons of stuff that would be time-related in the past.
---
You can also get it from the ground sometimes by looking up at him and the activator will appear.
---
Yes this 100%, they especially suck if their reason for doing it "herp-dur I'm role-playing a trap camp"
---
You can't drop a legendary Dragon at the current moment, If I'm not mistaken it used to drop sometimes as a reward for the removed Vault raid.
---
It is if you did it yourself.
---
My very first time playing the mode 2 weeks ago I killed 2 people and managed to stay alive for around 20 minutes.  Then the score screen popped up
---
"Time spent alive +400 xp.  Kills +40 xp.". Umm.....WTF!!
---
I knew going in that staying alive gave more xp than kills but didn't expect the numbers to look like that.
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt know that thanks
---
No, didn‚Äôt get another for 200 hours.
---
Your welcome :) If I farm for the whole two hours I get a ton of junk scrip gear too. Also you get a good chance at 3 star legendaries. Usually at least two in each pass
---
You may be going down in a group because you are losing damage reduction from Lone Wanderer. Lone Wanderer can be replaced by the empath mutation. This mutation counts you as your own teammate, so there is no downside provided you are on a team. With Class Freak reducing the negative effect, you gain damage resistance from your own mutation. If a teammate has empath, it stacks so you have more damage resistance. You can still play solo, but with group benefits.
---
I love that jump. It‚Äôs my main reason for doing that event. I don‚Äôt know how people function without mutations in this game. It‚Äôs so much more fun to have the freedom to jump super high, run faster, and fall from nearly any distance.
---
Yes! 6 items instead of 4! I totally feel you on the camp aesthetics too.
---
From what I gather is you go to the ammunition factory in the Northeast, and there's a way you can blueprint the machine after you take over the workshop.
---
I know it's a bug, not sure if it is bannable or considered an exploit. Me personally I'm not going to risk it.
---
Fucking nice!
---
Much appreciated
---
It's a gif
---
Bcuz me oly pley waywod then waas deipointed. Not that hard to understand.
---
I‚Äôll probably end up doing that too just because pulling out a heavy gun for one or two ghouls seems a little excessive
---
I appreciate it, but it took a lot of pain on my part to get passed that. I know, I know, some people probably think that‚Äôs silly but fallout is very personal to me, always has been since I‚Äôve been playing since I was 8 or 9 years old on windows 98‚Äô. Been obsessed with every fallout addition and fallout 76 has been the worst addiction for me. It‚Äôs like the worst fallout game yet I can‚Äôt put it down lol. I think I can speak for most fallout players that fallout just satisfies a need in all of our souls that I don‚Äôt think anyone can really pinpoint. Something about just a bleak future for America resonates within us for some reason. I could make this post go on forever so I‚Äôm just gonna stop there lol but I‚Äôm sure you get my point since you seem kind of in the same boat. Take a break if you have to, it is very worth it even if it doesn‚Äôt seem like it right now especially since you want all the score.
---
I agree with you. But sadly on Reddit there's lots of people who hate you if you spend any money on Fallout so you will get downvoted to the far depths of Hell.
---
Christ man seems like you're the only low iq. Wayward isnt even the main wastelanders quest.
---
Damn son.  I learned knowledge from you
---
I had to Idea on that one.
---
Ones floors, ones walls
---
I also like having some backup available.
---
Ran into Wendigo Colossus the other day, on a building team where everyone was doing their own thing, so I did the "come here" emote, and then got on mic to put out the word.
---
Only 1/4 showed up, but he brought his tent, which was a godsend, since I ran out of all other ammo (even for my battlefield pickups) had to resort to random melee I picked up, but with access to stash, I was able to grab my primed gatling plasma from display and take care of business.
---
Hmm. Damn I was hoping it was legit. Well, pulled a couple hundred 45 ammo from his machines so I may not even need to try the exploit.
---
It's a basic chameleon effect. And short at that as it uses your AP to "fuel" the effect.
---
one is for the floor and the other for the walls
---
Hahaha i serve mm too. Thats my agent code name :)
---
I've given up hope, honestly. I feel like the controversy that surrounded it scared them away from ever rereleasing it, even though I'm sure no one would give a shit at this point. I've resigned to my kitchen always having an ice machine as a mock fridge.
---
That is correct. I used to camp near there and had an endless supply of meat haha.
---
I started with Fallout 3 and have loved every release since...well maybe not so much ‚Äúlove‚Äù for 76. But I feel the same way at times. I can only hope they do the TV show justice and not charge us 150 Atoms to watch the next episode lol.
---
PC
---
Good point! Hopefully we're not shafted.
---
I think the dome is the exclusive to that bundle.  I don't own that bundle and have the large succulents.
---
The best fun is to do it with the secret service jetpack to break your fall. You need to time it perfectly though! And have plenty of AP.
---
in misc
---
The furious one is way better espicaly with the vats
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survival\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survival_(Fallout_76)) in addition to the description on wiki, you could not fast travel in survival mode like in adventure mode. Best gamemode this game has had so far imo.
---
That's a wonderful shot, great timing.
---
Thank you for this answer. I haven‚Äôt applied this mutation yet because I wanted to get an answer on that.
---
Furious can theoretically get as high damage as Junkies after enough hits on the same enemy. But in practice, it rarely does, except maybe in very high fire rate weapons which the plasma caster is not. You could always test drive the furious, but more likely the junkies will be better.
---
Well seeing as they have a day timer and are in the vaulting soon section of the atom shop, I would say 6 days.
---
Yup, pallet walls and floors are just gorgeous imho.
---
Why have scrip sell/buy limits at all?  Scrip everything, buy a ton, repeat until you have a couple decent things to keep and get rid of all the junk.  Having a hard scrip limit or gold bullion limit or most of the artificial limits doesn't make any sense other then to time gate things artificially.
---
Hey thanks for responding. I‚Äôve been hesitant to add this mutation in fear of the negative effects.
---
Me too! I have bloodied BP rifle, two shot both rifle and pistol, trouble shooters rifle and instigating dragon. I am hoping to find never ending BP weapon, it would be awesome :3
---
Yeah. I hear this. I‚Äôm F2P so I don‚Äôt really run into this issue as I never really have that many atoms. The game obviously has as many small inconveniences as possible in order to drive more microtransaction/subscription revenue. That‚Äôs the bigger problem with FO76 to me. Ya know.
---
You would be exploiting a feature that was never supposed to be in the game, not to mention, you won't be able to get rid of it. Could get you banned or not, it is still a risk. On the other hand the raider one is good stuff
---
we literally have no way of knowing that.
---
Where is the little sheepsquatch located?
---
Just check your item either through your inventory or on a weapon or armor station, you will see under repair how many you have and also i believe it gives the item to the last character ypu played as
---
I think you all misunderstood me. I'm grinding the dailies to get the plan for the ammo maker the raiders give you once you reach max reputation with them.
---
I have the same issue with the normal bow and compound bow. I will have to try this to see if it works. Thanks for the tip!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not expecting anything with this show lol of course I hope it‚Äôs good. They have to really tie in story and characters from the games, because if they don‚Äôt it‚Äôll be just like the resident evil movies.
---
Let me ask Todd since this is Reddit, not Bethesda Q&amp;A line.
---
No, that happens across the board.
---
My wife on her PS4, on my PC (non-steam, non-gamepass) via launcher.
---
Tickets get canned responses concerning SCORE not delivered and closed nearly instantly.
---
Agreed, i aint getting that shit...
---
Ammo can storage is coming soon. So that will free up all that ammo weight.
---
Why not both?
---
Watoga underground should be a dungeon change my mind.
---
Someone did the math and, according to them, you should be rank 55 by the end of this week
---
I'd say go for it if you're constantly in a team!
---
I fear you're right. And isn't it funny how the collectron and fridge were met with so much backlash yet nearly every camp has at least one of the two lol.
---
Songs from South Park, please.
---
Yeah i edited because of it lol Still, there are people trying to group with you just to put that ammo maker from the factory at your camp, so be careful.
---
Yup, lasted till near end of the match and the only thing that spawned was a Scorched Grafton Monster.
---
I think it should alternate between double XP weekend and double XP week. It would give everyone a chance. I‚Äôve seen plenty of posts about players missing out on double XP weekend for one reason or another. So I think it‚Äôs only fair for those that can‚Äôt dedicate time on the weekend.
---
You know you can use scrap to repair as well right?
---
If this were a normal single player fallout sure, but so far all DLC has been free, so I guess this needs to happen if we want to keep the game going?
---
I'm expecting some flak for this!
---
"Finally, someone with the guts to ZZZZZZZZZ"
---
Omg effff those RE movies. Such a wasted opportunity.
---
What the fuck fuck that shit then and here I am being an event leader on a daily basis. I don't need that bannable shit near me. Boutta just play in my own server then.
---
Yep. Its also an Iconic weapon in the fallout series. Its been reduced to a steaming pile of garbage in this game. Thats sad.
---
I don't know why people keep saying this.  It caps out at 90% (like all the weight reductions) so if you already have the sneak perk at 3 (75%) then you only need to add a single piece (+15%).  If you don't run the sneak perk or run it at less then 3 then it does help to have multiple pieces.
---
So in general most people run sneak at max so in that regard it doesn't stack since you hit the max.  I **don't** run the sneak perk and have all 5 pieces cham/sneak and I sneak like a pro, literally can sneak up to a lvl 62 ghoul, bash it in the head, then kneel back down and it turns around and looks and then goes back to what it was doing.  It's quite humorous.
---
I found out my old internet was only "up to 18mbps," and it was in apartments in town, so I'm hoping that 10 with no one around will be about the same.
---
I work nights, have joint custody, and my wife works days, so when I don't have my son and stay up too late, the only one is screws over is myself.
---
Thats an awesome collection! I got 2 explosive bp pistols one thats instigating, a 2 shot bp rifle, and a anti armor explosive dragon :D
---
Fallout 1st as it comes with a scrapbox
---
Or [this!](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1CMHez8jQUjRcTUDOWjXKNor9yFnr23iPgo84d58_VrY/mobilebasic#h.aznkdsutytom) This guide is quite helpful for those struggling
---
for bushwookies like me, that's 100x easier than killing 1 player.
---
no vertibird power armor, why even live
---
Should be easily doable with the bonus weekend then, thanks!
---
That is all patch 21 datamine so not until August 4th?
---
Yeah, clip the ground and build underneath.
---
Fwiw too~
---
You can repair weapons and armor on their respective bench and it only costs junk.
---
Plus there are perks that allow you to repair to 200% at a workbench.
---
Over 1000 hours into the game and have yet to use a repair kit even though I get a fair few from the SBQ event.
---
And as Phil-King said, the repair kits would have been applied to whatever character you had selected at the time of purchase, so if you have multiple characters it may have went to the wrong toon.
---
That error message is infuriating.
---
I had to move my CAMP twice after adding stairs to make another/new entrance. (cuz my fast travel spot went to opposite side of house and there was no amount of moving camp device that would fix it) Both staircase entrances permanantly anchored to the world, nothing I could do would delete them or anything attached to them and gave that error.
---
2nd time I built a staircase entrance and placed the whole floor radius but one side was too wide and then I realized the entire floor was undeletable. I stripped everything I could which was basically the center floors, all the outer ones were permanent. Even placing a lone foundation with stairs attached can suddenly makes both objects undeletable. Also had an alt get stairs I placed inside a room to make a 2nd floor become permanent before I even started building the floors for it.
---
3rd time I banned stairs from ever being used in my CAMP again. And I asked for a refund on the atom store ones, which I got.
---
Camp garden https://imgur.com/gallery/XZ8L3cS
---
Heres a picture of my garden attached. You can see in the background we are under the map.
---
How are atoms pay to win?
---
Repair kits are piss easy to find in the game.
---
I could have more free time if I wanted but I‚Äôm trying not to ignore my family too much lol.
---
Wait. What?
---
Yes, switching back to the default or the Settlers/Raiders one fixes it.
---
It breaks your camp so wouldn't recommend building them regardless of any potential Bethesda repercussions.
---
Yup I got the canned response but responded back that they did not resolve my issue. I doubt I will hear anything back from that.
---
Yeah - it's the FACT  (Factions).
---
If two NPCs have a FACT in common, they will be friendly.
---
There is also a hostility setting, and usually only Critters (radstag, opposum) will use a Flee from Everything script.
---
Whoever set up the Bots on Parade NPCs really shit the bed with the FACT flags. That's why you can't initially VATS the enemies.
---
I just hate it when i get on with my friends and boom my camp cant be placed.
---
I told myself next time that happens the persons camp is getting nuked.
---
First I‚Äôve heard of that; was that a datamine?
---
For real. Maybe fallout will come out better as a series, at least I think that‚Äôs the right move, screw a movie take your time with a couple seasons you know. Like if season one was about the story of fallout 1, then 2, and so on and so forth I think that could be good, straight forward and probably what most fans want out a show anyway. We want to see characters from the games, the story, things only us fallout nerds will understand. There‚Äôs a fallout YouTube series, I forget what it‚Äôs called it‚Äôs like Nuka something, but that was alright I just didn‚Äôt think they pulled enough, if anything, from the games. It seemed like a play with Fallout themed props.
---
The switchover happens at 12 p.m. EST so it's best to be out of the game from 11:45-12:15.
---
I don't know... they've released other items using the same functionality - there was a Red Rocket cooler in there at least a day or two ago, and the log cabin bundle had a "rustic icebox", I think they called it?
---
Explain please
---
challenges completed during a weekend should be doubled no matter what they are. what about 'double xp weekend, but not for events'. sounds bout the same? but nah, that just sound stupid.
---
just like any score challenges not being doubled during the double weekend.
---
The Scorchbeast Queen currently has what was considered to be a bug (by both the playerbase ***as well as the Bethesda correspondence people in this subreddit***) where you can't cripple her and cause her to land, something that has been articulated by Beth to be possible. Turns out data miners found that "bug" to actually be an intentional "perk" of the SBQ that's literally attached to an on/off toggle, meaning it's not a bug at all, but a behavior they made a conscious decision to add (and could literally fix with a few mouse clicks). The communication from their developers to the people that correspond with the community don't line up on this and most likely don't for a lot of things. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing.
---
I think the Brotherhood is supposed to return?  Who knows how that‚Äôs gonna get incorporated.
---
nope, met some guy with TONS of legacies and god rolls like BE gat plas, gatling gun, [50.cal](https://50.cal), tesla, AAE cryo, gat plas and it just goes on and on, i could confidently say that the BE15 gat plas is duped as that was involved in the recent dupewave
---
Magic 8 ball says...!
---
Maybe.
---
Doing the same thing. I'm level 50, it's going to take another 20 levels to get my build done because of the late perks you get.
---
did anyone actually dig those values from the executable, though? because last I checked nobody knew for sure how the sneak formula worked. you can't assume it's simple addition without the data to back it up.
---
I'm basing myself turtle's anecdotal/practical testing.
---
That‚Äôs probably not going to happen.
---
He has ascended to join our great lord
---
Ok cool noted.
---
Why would you even bother with the NW challenges?
---
I'm at rank 47 and I didn't do a single NW challenge so far.
---
Thanks wasn‚Äôt sure what to actually search to find info on :/ I was doing so well on the legendary run too
---
You can always make a ‚Äúmule‚Äù or 4 if storage is an issue. Even my new alt character has 2 mules. I stash excess weapons, junk(don‚Äôt have 1st on alt), stims, stealth boys, armor. My main has over 200 pounds of room so when I catch someone with a bunch of junk I have room to stash
---
Still a cool pic.
---
Junkies. Furious is horrible on low fire rate weapons.
---
How many characters do you have
---
I have a bad feeling it‚Äôs going to have nothing to do with established lore from past games and just be its own thing with the generic candy coating of post apocalyptic world stuff.
---
Speak the truth.
---
I had a couple thoughts on this, but they've all been out weighed by the fact that Furious is going to have to ramp up to the damage of the junkies, assuming whatever you're fighting is going to live that long. 
---
If you want to get rid of your negatives from your addictions AND are not going to be using power armor, the furious might be a consideration for you, otherwise, powerarmor and stabilized will have the one star junkies out performing the furious. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
Junkies, since the plasma caster is more of a one-shot weapon.
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Atleast it's not 9 anymore. And btw, you can earn that 250 score faster if you just farm xp on adventure mode.
---
I thought her not landing behaviour was due to too many people being in places she couldn't get to, by patching nodes or whatever. People staying out of reach on the bunker or standing on the fence or whatever. I thought that was the reason she'd very rarely land and spend minutes repeatedly divebombing through the ground.
---
But what you're saying probably makes more sense.
---
We‚Äôre around 30% through the season and it‚Äôs still broken.
---
Anyone wearing it is basically wearing a dunce cap
---
Yeah the auto complete bug is brutal. 3x so when it gets your weeklies
---
I'm about ready to stop doing any of the nw ones honestly.  It's the same map everytime.  I could kill 5 in 1 round on flatwoods but nope.
---
Yeah, remember that a data miner saying it was 15% per piece. Which again is why having more than one is useless if you already have the perk maxed.  But I rather have my agility points for something else if I can get around it.

That third perk on Armor is just a way of getting around using perks in your Loadout if you think about it. If I want to run a bunch of points reduce the weight of food or ammo or weapons or do I want to get armor that does it so I can save the points for something else. It's all one big balancing act.
---
Either you bought them for a different character (They‚Äôre character bound), or you‚Äôre just not inspecting the items and hitting the repair option.
---
I feel the same...
---
Following this for the same reason!
---
Yeah... I was excited hearing about it originally, and was a bit disappointed I'd missed it when it was first around, but, after seeing one in someone's camp... eh. I'd just stick with the darn Modern Fireplace for now... at least until when/if I get the secret door one... or the hunting lodge one I saw datamined somewhere? *That* one actually looks like it could be decent!
---
Furious damage increases with each hit up to 50% and I think it takes 9 or 10 hits to get up to that limit.  Junkie's is a flat 50% damage increase with 5 addictions.  The downside with Furious is if you hit a different enemy, your hit count resets to 0...so its tough max out when enemies are bunched together.
---
If you're already a Junkie's build and have your addictions, I would probably use the 1\* Junkie's until you're able to roll a better weapon.
---
That's true of anything that's 'assigned' from the stash, stuff in refrigerators, the gear you put on allies, etc. It's technically in the stash the whole time, just flagged as associated w/a particular CAMP item.
---
Band aids.
---
Yes!
---
They offered the cat for free in the store. They must have broken it like the armor/weapon plans and the fasnacht balloons
---
I used to, until four new layers of grind over the past few months made that feel like a fat waste of time :/
---
Yeah man unless it's like place camps down I ignore the nw ones
---
Hey Sneed, looks dissectable.
---
There still working through the thousands of bans they just did.  Give them time...
---
It's an exploit. Two guys placed a ton at my camp to take up my camp budget and theyre not removable. You'll lose budget permanently if you place them at your camp.
---
*Cries in no LMG skins.*
---
They probably deleted it like half the armor/weapon plans and the fasnacht balloons
---
So take away the one, single, sole penalty for death? Nah man. This should still *try* to be a Fallout game, not Hand Holding Simulator 76.
---
Aren‚Äôt cheaters the people who want the game easier? Since you know....they are cheating.
---
When legendary board game started I was level 360. Knowing it took XP to blast through the board game i took a deeper look at XP buffing. Prior to double XP weekend I hit 420. By the end of double XP I hit 450.
---
The time it took me since beta to get to 360 and that's playing nearly every day but no regard for XP. It took me about 4 weeks to go from 360 to 450 with build team and buffs. It's not impossible but it takes some figuring out.
---
Only the Dailies will have the score doubled.
---
Too bad.  I could play for hours listening to a continuous loop of "Let's Fighting Love" in English/Japanese.
---
Text chat is my biggest pet peeve about this game. I do not want to use a mic I don't appreciate that a mic is currently the only way to communicate in this game.
---
Also I want to be able to display my Giant Mr Fuzzy.
---
Check them for what?
---
It's actually both of these things in conjunction with each other. And I would place more blame on her not landing on level 245's that ***still*** haven't figured out that standing on their floating tent while everyone gives you the thumbs down emote was making her stay in the air. So not only is she wrongly programmed not to get crippled, there's player targeting bugs further exacerbating the no-land scenario. 
---
This is their big endgame boss and they half-assed it.
---
People missing atoms, thousands still waiting for their suspensions to be lifted, SCORE bugs, myriad game breaking glitches, ticket after ticket after ticket...
---
Meanwhile, Bethesda are rolling around in our cash like Scrooge McDuck üòÇ
---
My main is level 346 now 1.1k hours in
---
This post is missing a number of things thats available from the other tabs.
---
Sack up and quit the game then. Otherwise you're wasting breath.
---
I think their point was, what happens if/when you hit rank 100? SCORE presumably becomes meaningless at that point, so... is there still any point to challenges at that point?
---
Dense chest mod stops you taking any damage from your explosive weapons (apart from legacies)
---
it kind saddens me knowing ive been playing since pre-alpha/beta phase and i only have 1 account thats level 139
---
The irony of this post.
---
Thanks, wasn't expecting new responses after so long, but very much appreciated.
---
How could we possibly know that?
---
I‚Äôve only had 3 left I can do and one is the gain xp one :/
---
Man.  You people complain that fast traveling doesn't work at all and now you are complaining that it doesn't go where you want.   Be happy fast traveling is working....the devs can only do so much!
---
^(/s)
---
I should imagine that it would
---
Otherwise the first score rank would be like 4000 points
---
Its all about straight grinding and using buffs to increase XP gain (Bobbleheads, mutations, etc). 
---
Ive been playing since launch and my only character is level 90. I just dont grind as much as others.
---
I reached lvl 204 after 201 hours. 10-15 of those was just from the double xp weekend last week. So if you grind a lot during those events, you get a looot if xp. There is 3 events that is very very good do wise, and with lunch boxes you get a lot of xp.
---
When you star anew. Character do they start from scratch ,level1 or do you keep experience?
---
That‚Äôs kinda rare but could be lol
---
Starter bundle with game pass before tax it‚Äôs $7.19 for 1,100 atoms and a bunch of relate kit scrap kits, and for the regular 1,100 atoms it‚Äôs $8.99 with game pass... with no repair kits. Kinda odd lol
---
Edit- you can only buy the starter bundle once. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I've been asking myself this the last few days. My backlog of games is huge. I own a lot of the AAA games that came out recently. I've played them for a couple hours each. I've still been playing FO76 almost every day, for a few hours.  
---
I've always liked Fallout games. The whole package is great, but i think i've realized there must something about sneaking around in an apocalypse and shooting monsters that's supersatisfying to me. Simple as that. The very basic mechanic of the game must be my thing.
---
100 freakin' percent.
---
Also The Mire in my case. There's something about it, it's such a pretty landscape and somehow manages to give an eery feel out of it. You could find most if not all "bosses" or stronger enemies in this biome and that's enough to make me love it and be scared of exploring it at the same time
---
What events?
---
You seem upset.
---
Start at 1 with nothing
---
And the answer is still the same, nothing but S.C.O.R.E. Which is pointless since you're done. Some have exploited the system to max out their Run already and that's what was reported.
---
Psh that's easy, I accidently fell when a player suddenly appeared out of nowhere and plummeted to the bottom without any damage.
---
That could be an even worse punishment.
---
All the items in "Defenses" contribute defense points to your build (I think there's a shield icon). I think the tire walls are purely cosmetic, therefore decor.
---
bro this deserves the appalachia photograph award!
---
I've only been playing for a few months and I'm a few levels short of 200. So people playing since launch... Well its no surprise you get those 800+.
---
Ok what about endurance not working on armor or rubberbanding mobs, those have been known and aconowledged since beta
---
lol noob
---
I already had to hunt for a bunch of junk I had in my museum after moving my camp once, breaking it isn't on my bucket list.
---
I saw a 6388 once :O
---
Wait... are you saying Herd Mentality works so long as you're in a group, even just by yourself? If so.. um... wow! Know what I'm doing tonight if that's the case! (Kinda would appreciate if someone could confirm first, though?)
---
Such as? Everything is here...
---
Well pass that on to the team
---
I went from 341 to 356 this DXP. My main focus was getting to level 50 in NW from being level 41. (Not a pvper) i just wanted to unlock the 50+ door.
---
That doesn‚Äôt seem right, though - the reason I decided to check if I had the plan learnt was that Angry Turtle made a video of mentioning it, and I wanted to check if I‚Äôd learned the plan like I remembered. He was able to craft it on a second character, so it can‚Äôt have been completely removed.
---
Only one of the weekly challenges for me was already complete destroy assorted robots glad to know im not the only one having this issue but i guess it could be worse if you guys have multiple ones complete hopefully they'll fix it
---
True but if they base the game further in the timeline what's stopping the survivers if the US to go to other countries using vertibirds or even prewar planes like the bomber from new Vegas. And then they could introduce new creatures which would still be mutated from radiation. And factions from whatever country we visit. Plus experiments like the fev doesn't have to be just a US thing, neither would utilizing nuclear fusion for purposes like armor .
---
i once saw a lvl 1200+ and it was like seeing a 5* legendary, i added the player for my insurance
---
yes
---
Use imgur
---
I feel you there man. I know for me it's about helping me people, almost like repaying a debt
---
It's not part of that bundle.  It was a standalone Sheepsquatch Plush from the Atomic Shop.
---
This might be a newbie question, but what the hell are you doing to earn enough XP to level in a day? Also, if I (at lvl 100 say) did what you do at lvl 800, would I earn the same amount of XP or is XP scaled?
---
Oh ok thanks
---
The Pallet Walls are very nice.
---
I had used the Wood Paneling wallpaper quite a bit, but it's nice to have an option that runs horizontally.
---
It‚Äôs certainly not bad. My Excavator suit alongside my mutations let me power (Pun intended) through events taking minimal damage.
---
im around 1k - 2k hours in at lvl 139 so tips would be nice
---
Haha yeah, I know. But why would I pick a fight with a level 600 who has 20 duped legacy weapons when I can just destroy a level 15 who only has a pipe pistol?
---
The missile launcher isn't actually that bad damage wise.
---
What makes it completely useless is its pathetic durability. All the explosive heavy weapons suffer from this because weapons only lose durability on hits and not shots fired. So when you use an explosive weapon as intended and hit large groups. The thing will break after like 10 rockets because of how much damage it takes to its durability.
---
I also lost 7250 Score today. 
---
Are they gonna compensate players who lose out on score due to the auto-complete bug?
---
No worries, thanks for the response. Ended up accidentally testing it another way. My wife has 12 small and 10 industrial at her camp, so I had the industrial locked and since her camp is near vault 76 figured I'd leave the small ones unlocked for the newbies. 
---
So kept checking back on her camp every 1-2 hours for a day, her small ones were always cleared out and the industrial had hardly anything, 0-1 each. I locked all the small ones, now they all fill up as expected. 
---
So it seems that having small and industrial gives 72/hour total, and the water gets deposited into the smallest purifiers first. I assume that having the medium size would mean that they would fill up after the small, and the industrial purifiers only fill up once everything else is full
---
I only go for Monster mash, and the robot killing daily
---
Line in the Sand is one of them.
---
Any stash box? I have a dumpster but no "blue" stash box. I am new and I have the red rocket as my "vendor" building and love it for the RP.
---
All good man I hope it works for you too!
---
This was my second time being on during the refresh and neither time have i lost score. I'm really curious what the actual cause of the loss is, I hope we eventually find out.
---
know every plan in the game. Apparently there's 1300
---
Guided Meditation, One Violent Night, Uranium Fever, Line In The Sand, Radiation Rumble. Those is good (more than 3)
---
Monster Madness is also great, if you just pick up the mask. But never the candy bucket, as the mobs spawn rather fast and run to the bucket.
---
I know people have had issues with the SCORE. I was talking about the atoms not getting paid out, which is only happening to steam users.
---
I am vengeance! I am the night! I am MOTHMAN!
---
if looking for damage, id consider having tenderizer 3 in the CHA special.  
---
my suggestion to get these 3 points would be to knock strong back and reduce ironclad. im absolutly no fan of having a fix bonus on capacity, rather have perk reducing the weight of what you're carrying. how about bandolier 2? i use to carry an insane amount of ammo and i got way more free space in my stash (to fill it with other stuff i'll never use :D)
---
Ya think üòÇ
---
Oh. Well that's... disappointing. I kinda doubt I'll even get that far anyway, but still... this also makes me wonder what will happen between seasons? Will there just not be daily/weekly challenges at all during those times? :/
---
Well we realy dont know what there doing for next season yet, for all we know they could change it to something Completly
---
HA, if I good legendary items worth anything then I wouldn‚Äôt have to pick on new players would I? You didn‚Äôt think about that.
---
Does it bank any you haven't collected when you sign off?
---
I have a 405 character and a 185 character, 1700 hrs. playing 76. It's all about the grind lol
---
I found out from this Angry Turtle video
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up33CokPoDQ
---
go to 7:33
---
Can you not play for the rest of the season?
---
mine is to hold in my toons hands a legendary Fixer of some sort...I keep reading about them but have never had the pleasure of owning one, or even seeing one in a vendor..
---
for like 10% of the earth's population, sure
---
I can. But I had saved up a bunch of atoms and I really wanted that fireplace door üòÇ
---
you were Bethesda'd
---
shoot dang, thats a lot to learn haha
---
same here!
---
Adrenaline is broken right now, so adding points to it won't help until the next patch update.
---
For high health, the biggest damage increase is from stealth.  My changes would be:
---
* Use Chemist Backpack, remove traveling pharmacy, move 3 points to Agility
---
* Move 4 Points from Endurance to Agility
---
* Agility: Remove White Knight, Rank 3 Sneak, Rank 3 Covert Op, Escape Artist, Adrenaline Rank 2 (when it's fixed)
---
* Add Bird Bones, Scaly Skin mutations
---
Another thing you can add is Adrenal Mutation and keep you're health around 80%.  You're still essentially high health build at that point, but you get a boost in damage and boost in strength if you use Radicool.  Although the effects of Vanguards will be diminished, so you may be better with 15% reduction armor like Troubleshooters, Mutant Slayer's, etc.
---
Nuclear fission was exclusively a US discovery, as was FEV.
---
- Sell 10k of each type of ammo 
---
- prep for the junk/scrap deposit missions from BoS
---
- solo a wendigo colossus
---
- start your own quest line for other players
---
- create a trap / damage camp
---
- innovate the build process (discover a useful, non-game breaking glitch)
---
- display each type of 3* legendary weapon
---
I don‚Äôt think so but I‚Äôve never really paid attention
---
Thorn armor has bonus to stealth (but it will use up all your scrip each day for a roll on 1 piece)
---
I have no life
---
I have 4 wins w/o firing a shot at another player as a bush wookie, and make the last 10 90% of the time
---
1 win in a team, but generally dont make the top 10 when playing aggressive.
---
I love when the SB does the killing for me.
---
You're right. My bad. I was thinking logically and game developers struggle with that.
---
Or weapon skins for weapons that 90% of players use.
---
Yea and I would not want a fortnite style battle pass
---
Do you have the fixer plan? I've gotten more than a few after I got the plan but most are poopy caca
---
If you want to go full optimization, drop all the strength perks. My build I only have 3 strength, but I'm going to move it to. Get the chem backpack mod from the raiders, it does the same thing as rank 3 travelling pharmacy, freeing up 3 points.
---
Concentrated fire rank 3 is a must. For me I'm getting 95% after the 1st shot usually. 
---
Adrenaline is currently broken and doesn't work, but I don't use it in my build. I usually 1-2 shot anything normally.
---
Get yourself an instigating lever action, that's my 1-2 shotter right there. If you're fighting the queen, or a deathclaw, an anti armor one is the way to go.
---
If you have any other questions please ask!
---
Friendly reminder to everyone, weeklies will not be affected, only dailies.
---
No. The bug mostly happens when you log NW (or to Atom Shop, or to the Legendary Run) first.
---
If you are progressed any in the challenges today, you are safe.
---
No one said it was fixed. In fact, there are dozens of posts here daily saying the opposite.
---
1 single act of retribution and a 'haha pwned' reddit post is angry? You might want to consider pulling out a dictionary. Also while you are looking up the word angry, spellcheck innocuous. Or innocent. Or whatever other word you were trying to use was.
---
It's kind of amazing they never released another Display *like* it either.
---
Thanks pal, I already forgot this and was about to smash my head against the wall.
---
Can confirm now, the atoms are completely gone
---
i think the only person that has to do anything with 'sacks' is you-- taking bethesda's out of your fucking mouth.
---
Try to run Building for the *extra xp for everything* boost due to increased Int, then switch to Events when running an event, then back to Building.
---
Legend says they're still fighting to this very day.
---
great ideas!!!!
---
Question on a few though:
---
\-what do you mean by " prep for the junk/scrap deposit missions from BoS"?
---
\-also " start your own quest line for other players"?
---
Nah, we just finish them faster and thats why we have to wait longer for a new one.
---
I think it would be cool to get 1.5x XP for an entire week.
---
Thanks! How do I submit it?
---
Yeah, already have enough of that in many places of the game.
---
\*logs/relogs into game\* "dO yOu wAnT tO sEe tHe aToM sToRe, aGaIn!!?"

\*opens perks to swap one perk\* "YOUHAVE5UNOPENEDPERKPACKS OPEN NAOW!!?? \*no's\* "HEYLISTEN YOU HAVE 55 LEVEL UPS, BUYPERKSNOW OR SWAP POINT!!@?" \*no, dammit, staawhp\*
---
Great input- appreciated. Do you think it'd be worth me changing into a sneak rifle build? I'm seeing a lot of that on my other posts in other forums and how being sneak would really help
---
Agreed it makes me feel good when people do like I made something that people want to look at.
---
I just found out that some people trap bases and that makes me sad... I want people to look around..
---
Having just got this last night and set it up - this is great to know - thanks!
---
I am saying I don‚Äôt think fallout in my opinion has great characters as a staple, it‚Äôs more about atmosphere and storytelling outside of direct character narratives. None of the games really shine as having great characters. The story around Abbie, for example, was better than any character arch in FO4 IMO. We didn‚Äôt meet her, but her story is tragic. 
---
It‚Äôs the environment that makes these games great, not the NPCs.
---
AND those pub events are garbage with very few spawns.
---
You get more exp from rad rumble, line in the sand, and others by taking 8% exp on the mobs than 100% for the end.
---
Not quite what I had meant lol but yes
---
If this is how you feel, why do you even bother looking at posts here? It's like you want to be miserable viewing thing you don't like. Doesn't make sense to me. Lol
---
Actually I have an idea go play fortnite, I heard it won game of the year, I don't troll the reddit, but then again I think fortnite is trash. I'll stick to a game I enjoy, go find your own.
---
Im at lvl 481 on My main character  1197 hours in
---
Now this is an idea I can support.
---
It's usually 7 isn't it? 5 Adventure challenges, 1 NW challenge, and the Gold Star complete 5 daily challenges. So 2 more for 9.
---
There's 2 plans in the game that are ludicrously rare. Healing salve Bog and healing salve mire. You can only find them inside mirrors in those areas. 
---
i reckon at a guess i know about 900 or so. Absolute guess mind you. Just going off the plans that npc vendors have that i haven't bought yet. 
---
Also. You could try and find all the Asylum uniforms. Spent 120+ hours so far and still missing red which is very very rare.
---
We are a newbie group, still doing the story quests, and we always put it on Build and not Quest, because none of us need the Charisma bonus. When we take a break from quests and do events, we SOMETIMES convert the group to Event because it gives XP. Unfortunately, we eat up all the events super fast, and we have to wait for new ones to spawn. So, maybe do some dailies, but they‚Äôre not Events, so we convert back to Build. In the end, might as well just leave it on Build and call it a day. Boo.
---
If you're just looking for legendaries to turn into Scrip, Leader of the Pack awards 3 different 1* legendaries.
---
I thought that just made them leave you alone not tame them. Damn if I'd known that I'd have had it from day 1
---
If you do the math, that is essentially impossible without cheating. There was a well known XP glitch early in the game. People who used it were not banned, nor was their level rolled back.
---
IIRC there are Blood Eagle skins in The Legendary Run, but I feel ya.
---
Well I did say "like fev" so it doesn't have to be that exact virus. And none of these absolutely be just a US thing. Given how the Chinese have infiltrated so much of the US. The lore can always be added to. It's still a story being written right?
---
I don't even grind I just like to kill stuff. Got a 262, 220,124, and a level 100. Just 2000 hours of killing everything efficiently
---
People who have played longer than you..
---
Forest. The cicadas are beyond annoying, my tinnitus is bad enough without them
---
Do you mean Scrip?
---
Yep, sneak is a godsend. That's what I use, I don't remember the last time I've had to heal myself up. 
---
With the Chinese stealth armor and rank 3 sneak, I've actually gotten right next to a super mutant without being detected. 
---
At first I played pretty much what you are now, a normal rifleman, but I switched it to a sneak crit one and it's much better.
---
The short version is in most zones the first player in the area's level dictates the enemy level. Someone higher was there  before you. Stick to the west side of the map until you're higher level.
---
Wow! what an awesome picture!!
---
No. 
---
But be sure to log into adventure after just in case.
---
That looks like a huge ass roach rocking out on a guitar.  OMG.  Very cool.
---
Greed, looks at the bill.
---
Scout armor is probably gonna be the best non legendary for you. At least until you can grind out the gold bullion for secret service armor. which is gonna take a while.
---
Edit: forgot to mention secret service is totally worth the grind. its only second in damage resistance to actual power armor.
---
Heavy combat armor
---
Sorry, I'll make a more worldwide fit title next time :)

I use a mobile app like Apollo which has an image upload ability.

Double dailies start Thursday. Dailies
---
Typical glass cannon, no need to need the build I get killed by level 1 radroaches at the queen event every damn time!
---
This. This this this. I had to demolish my entire CAMP recently because I put down a foundation and then COULDN'T REMOVE IT.
---
Then I couldn't place it back where I've had it for pretty much the character's entire playthrough!
---
That's amazing. I think that is what I'm going to try. Would you mind sharing your special and perks with me if you have time? I want to save up level ups so I can do this correctly ü§£
---
It‚Äôs called ‚Äúdouble dailies‚Äù.... logically that is dailies.
---
ya, bought the plan from a player awhile ago, so that's not the issue.
---
hell...I'd only come out at night if I could even get a one star Nocturnal lol...
---
couldnt even edit it before it got f\*cking removed. Bethesda are pieces of shit
---
As a Fallout First member, this is not the kind of benefit I want to see. I want to see  persistent private worlds with ability to permanently claim and build up workshops (even if the resource collectors don't work while you're offline) where I can adjust the world rules to remove do things like remove PvP restrictions, increase the level cap, etc. I want to see exclusive discounts in the atom shop. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they'd throw us a few repair kits once in a while. 
---
I don't want the features that absolutely should be in the game just shoved into First. The daily limits need to go. It's stupid that I have to create separate characters to hold all the legendaries I get. The dailies and the Legendary Run both do enough to keep people coming back every day. The daily limits just discourage players from playing for long periods of time. At a bare minimum they need scrip notes like the treasury notes, but that's not even ideal. Removing the srip limit would just get people playing the game more. Hell, I'd be fine if they removed the limits and made weapons give less in scrip back, so there were more diminishing returns.
---
Yeah i still have hopes that we will get a Camo skin for the LMG.
---
Funny, the cicadas in the forest put me at ease because they remind me of home in summer.
---
I think I saw you once. Where did you get that awesome backpack?
---
You don‚Äôt need repair kits to repair weapons.... use junk to repair weapons at workbenches. 
---
This post terrifies me.
---
Here is my stealth rifle build:

---
So word on the street is that an upcoming mission from a BoS member is to deposit junk. No idea what types but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to focus on steel, lead, copper, aluminum and adhesive. 
---
The start your own quest involves displaying instructions at your camp - example - ‚ÄúI dropped [item] somewhere in the mire. Find it can you get [x] reward. Fetch quest basically. Turns yourself into somewhat of an NPC.
---
I do that all the time but I doubt it was me since I've been wearing the grognak shit for a week. I wear the white wolf fedora and use a three claw death claw gauntlet.
---
That's it right there. I like NW as a side hobby, but having to restart the game without mods each time is annoying (though understandable).
---
Scout armour is best but BoS heavy combat is easier to get and mod IMO
---
It's a good connection in theory, but wouldn't work well in practice. It seems they are trying to balance the daily login incentives with f1st/atom shop sales. Removing all restrictions from the game with 1st would probably bring the game too close to pay to win in their eyes, people who *just* pay for the game would then be getting a f2p mobile game experience in comparison. You want to skip all these ads? Buy fallout first! You don't want to wait to redeem more of your scrip? Buy fallout first! No more room? Buy fallout first! Not like the game doesn't already feel that way sometimes, but it would truly cement it. That's not exactly the best idea when they're still charging $40 for the game and it already has a bad enough rep from the countless major issues that have yet to be fixed
---
Woah those are rad!!!
---
Heavy combat with weighted arms.
---
I actually don't care for generic camo skins, I never buy or use them.
---
Why? They made a game mode, they are rewarding people for playing it. It would be supremely weird if they didn't have at least one reward for it.
---
Buttressed Secret Service armor is the best, but that's technically legendary since you need modules to craft.  For other armor types, check out the spread sheet from here:

TLDR 
---
‚ÄúWe paid! Let us win‚Äù
---
You are mistaken
---
I feel you, I just hoped other people were more lucky lol
---
I second this. Scout Armor is expensive due to you needing to get lucky or buy it from the enclave. Heavy Combat armor is easily accessible and you can actually craft it. Put BOS mods on it and you are good to go.
---
I have the raider bot that has helped immensely in having a regular stash. I also grow razor grain and corn for booze and constantly farm ghouls for legendaries which helps my supply.
---
Reach level 1000 and have one of every perk card level.
---
Ah my bad, thought on the last ITV it had said they‚Äôd done a hot fix and added their tracking/logging thing
---
What do you have to do to get it? Kill Roper and then go back to him? Or does it drop when you threaten the dude before you deal with the free radicals?
---
You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong! They‚Äôre done with all the stories and they‚Äôre just playing with the highest level monsters constantly. Just grinding. Enjoy the story quests. Don‚Äôt worry about leveling faster.
---
With a lunchbox, full build team on a melee build the uranium fever netted about 2.3 ranks per event over the weekend
---
To get a Fixer you need to know the Fixer plan.  You get the Fixer plan as a random drop from Encryptid.   
---
I ran with a crew that was doing Encryptid up to 6 times in a row each weekend by server hopping.  One night I ended up with 4x fixer plans and the lady in our bunch beat me by 1, with 5 fixer plans.  The other guys hated us because they weren't getting any plans to drop.  
---
That being said, I was getting a lot of legendary rolling pin drops when they were getting decent weapons and armour, so maybe the karma evens out in the end....
---
I'm just whinging because it's cold, don't mind me.
---
I‚Äôve lost it five time now. I wasn‚Äôt on at or near the time of reset. That has never been the cause for me.
---
I want every plan in game, to actually max complete project paradise, for fun get addicted to every drug and start fighting a bear because why not, and get a full ss set
---
Oh man you on point imagine just for second if they added 76 as dlc to 4 with multiplayer I had mentioned this in another post that it would dope to visit all the areas as dlc for 76 Capitol wasteland new vegas hell even Pittsburg just give us the zones so we can explore and have all of it campable. I'd pay for that!
---
Oh, gotcha.
---
Are you surprised?
---
I actually really love this idea! Id also like it if the hunter team was bonus xp for not just legendary enemies but maybe boss/crowned ones too. It would be more incentive to stick together clearing areas and not just going solo.
---
Yep. I mean look no further than their Twitter account. It's always the same generic response.
---
Just stay in the team afterwards, I mean it's free xp. Unless you're server swapping I guess.
---
but my sadness when a fellow mutant joins my empty team, blessing me with heightened IQ and extra thicc muscles, only to leave after he fast travels to my camp. :(
---
The current workaround of not being logged in during server reboot seems to work for 90% of people, so...
---
Nukes.
---
I like soloing the Silo "dungeons" and being the reason why most high levels meet up to fight the SBQ. Makes me feel pretty cool. 
---
The only downside is when she summons up a bunch of random scorched mobs and some prick destroys them in all milliseconds with an OP weapon+build. Just do enough damage to "tag" them and leave them for everyone else?

I am sorry that you are a bit dense, maybe I could help you by rearranging the words in my post?

THE ATOMS-BUG IS PRESENT ON PS4 AND PC EVEN WITHOUT STEAM.
---
Sorry if I get pissed off when someone tells me that a bug me and my wife encounter is just not happening.

üëç
---
it sucks when Excavator is the only PA that can match my carry weight when I am in normal armor.
---
What I meant was most of the pvpers who used them (from my friendlist and various discord groups) have moved elsewhere and/or won't engage in workshops anymore. I would also say that legacy's perceived value has somewhat diminished due to glitched magical weapons that basically anyone can get and that will out-dps anything in core pve events.
---
Got the feeling that playing field is much more leveled than, say, half a year ago, when you literally couldn't go a day without meeting someone with NW Laser or Orbital Strike Cannon. Might be those bans, might be general toning down of pvp and introducing an extreme grind towards cosmetics, which caters to different sort of players. /rant off
---
got me
---
Level 1039. Almost 3000 hours. Been playing since beta. I agree with everyone else. Grind. Grind. Grind. The good thing is you pick up tons of legendary items to scrip, sell or very rarely use.
---
Takes away junk drops in pvp. 
---
Now no one pvps at all. 
---
Great for them pve players but not the right answer to encourage more pvp fights.
---
Have you noticed lately that they'll just all spawn at once when the queen dies? Maybe its just on PC
---
Realistically, if any weapon should down a Scorchbeast in one hit, it's the Fat Man.
---
I've heard of this but this did not work for me.
---
I logged on at 1245 eastern time
---
Haha nice.  That is awesome.
---
Is there a particular place I can get plans for BOS mods?
---
You can test the effects of these perks for your particular build. There are brackets around the word ‚Äòhidden‚Äô or ‚Äòcaution;‚Äô the smaller the bracket, the more likely you are to be detected. Try seeing how the brackets change with or without the perks around a high perception enemy like a turret. Personally, I think the sneak perks are worth it for bloodied builds if you are going for sneak attacks.
---
What about a level 50?
---
&gt;IIRC there are Blood Eagle skins in The Legendary Run, but I feel ya.
---
Yeah, but AFAIK they only have them for the handmade and sledge hammer, both of which already have several skins. Meanwhile, there's no skins for the Fixer (arguably the most popular gun in the game) LMG, 45 SMG, any of the pipe weapons, etc. Up until the legendary run ghillie paints there were no skins for most of the armor types, and AFAIK there still aren't any skins for raider armor.
---
I'm just sick of trading with people and having them constantly request the good shit I'm actually using, and as dumb as it is I'd actually be fine with spending a few atoms to skin those things.
---
For a company that is so obsessed with mtx bullshit they're incredibly tone deaf when it comes to making money by providing skins for things people actually use, and it just boggles my fucking mind.
---
I still haven't found a trap camp.  I've been lucky I guess.
---
I'd love to find a maze camp.  Not sure if people are even still making them but they sound like fun.
---
Grafton Station vendor bot has them for sale.
---
Definitely will look into grinding for secret service armor
---
But it doesn't work if they keep auto-completing. I'm multipling against 0 over here.
---
I have 2100 hours, my character levels are
---
412
---
209
---
208
---
207
---
161
---
All of them have been bloodied builds at one point or another and that really helps the XP gains as well as just the time played
---
That is lame. They should at least be rolled back...
---
I did that a couple times but not anymore. I don‚Äôt want anyone to be upset. :(
---
Yeah I have noticed that a bunch will always spawn nearby when she dies. But I'm too reluctant to not loot her first because she once despawned 15 seconds after dying and I lost out of loot because I was running about trying to target cockroaches and ticks from under my feet (seriously they're harder than regular scorched because they will jump at you and land behind you!)
---
Glad the mystery is solved üòé
---
And that's why I said 90%. 
---
Don't be logged in for about 30 min to an hour before and after server reset, don't have NW be your last game mode. 
---
For most people that avoids the problem, for those it doesn't I think it's a much deeper issue probably connected to why certain missions like Remove the Squatter will seemingly arbitrarily progress and auto complete.
---
This is the real answer in my opinion. While leveling 1-50 you quickly out pace the content and always end up punching down at some point. You can do this for hours/days before you finish the story and move to new areas that are now spawning at or above your level again and the exp POORS in. Add on the exp boosts from items/perks and read some kind of basic grinding guide for location ideas and you can pump out levels REALLY fast.
---
Yeah, the pacify option makes them leave you alone but the full rank let's you bring a little friend home. Death claws, cats, dogs, deer, rabbits, mirelurk kings, sloth, snallygasters and quite a few others are tameable as long as it's alone in a random encounter. For my wife's bow dead sloth she had to pacify it then walk up to it and hit the button to tame. 
---
Happy pet hunting.
---
Where is this workshop?
---
Not really. They take as long to complete as they always have. played for two hours and saw 3-4. Usually theres so many once I am done with one its 5 min and on to the next one..
---
They should have doubled the weeklies for this and not just the dailies since its only one week and would be a nice catch up for those that missed or lost score. Here's hoping they do this next season
---
Might be like Fertilizer Producers, how if the Brahmin dies the actual cart breaks
---
wtf. thanks for the warning.
---
Yep, same thing happens to me and my wife.
---
 I hope they bring the succulent plants back. I‚Äôd spend so many atoms for those little things. They just look so nice in everyone‚Äôs camp but mine! Haha
---
Also, yea...a usable nicer display case like the Thanksgiving case would be dope too..
---
What does explosive bait do?
---
Like I really didn't notice it until I was doing one of my VOD reviews and clipping highlights. I got straight up butt-blasted by 5 mirelurk kings üòÜ
---
Brilliant thanks for sharing.
---
Could you send me that reddit post? I‚Äôd love to read through it
---
Utilize all of the XP and INT buffs, perks and team bonuses available. XP isn't scaled. I get the same amount of base XP from, let's say a Super Mutant Warlord now as I did when I was level 100. But in that time I have learned how to efficiently manage the aforementioned bonuses as well as the XP farming routes and particular events I use.
---
To be fair, I didn't get the door either. This just doses you with nukashine
---
higher intelligence = more exp from everything, and thats just tip of the iceberg
---
100% my wife is the reason I continue to play. She isn't too into gaming and I love gaming. FO76 happens to be a game she also loves to play, so in order to do what I like doing, but also spend quality time with her, I continue to play even though I'm starting to grow bored of the game. What I don't grow bored of is spending time with and helping my wife in the hopes that she may one day also develop a love for gaming so I can introduce her to a world beyond her imagination. Lol too corny? Oh well haha.
---
üåµ
---
The fact that it's dailies *specifically avoids this issue*.
---
I was thinking normalizing xp requirements would fix not just this problem but help fix their  legendary coins idea.
---
This is Bethesda we're talking about...
---
You cant build in a teamates camp while in a public team, but you can if your in a private team.
---
So just avoid private teams with rando's til they get it sorted.
---
Thank you! I wish someone thought me these when I was a newbie.
---
I‚Äôve seen people say you can and cannot. I‚Äôm assuming you downvoted me, so I‚Äôll go ahead and ask that you provide me where in the ToS that it confirms what you are saying.
---
"Like are there any repeatable rewards like bonus lunchboxes or atoms or w.e after you hit rank 100? Or do the dailies just go back to being atom dailies?" Nope, you get nothing. Asked this same question last week and got a confirmed answer from a rank 100.
---
Absolutely not dude. That's an amazing story, its the same I stream, for the mrs. Do it for the love and you'll never go wrong dude.
---
What are you, 8? Grow the fuck up.
---
since run started seems to be less events available.
---
Yeah dude shit happens way too often, I lost ton of junk that I was collecting for an hour or so not once but TWICE, first game glitched and I got killed by ghouls at whitesprings dropped loot CRASHED, okay I thought shit happens, went into farming again came back to Whitesprings again for screws those 3 fucking level 62 ghouls caught me lacking again dropped all my shit DISCONNECTED, in result I rage quit the game, sometimes I wonder why I spend so many hours at this game..
---
No can do. I found out the hard way in a nuke zone. If you try to equip a SS chest piece with the jet pack mod on it, it will replace your Chinese stealth armor and you will die because of radiation very quickly. Not sure I answered the question correctly, but it‚Äôs a good PSA for players in general.
---
Explosive bait no longer works as part of griefing per last patch.
---
They did. That doesn't mention a fix though. If anything, it tells us what we already know - they have no idea what's happening with their code so they need specific tracking to find out where they messed up with this.
---
I'm thinking more along the lines of:
---
We paid, stop time gateing us.
---
Grafton as mentioned and Camden Park
---
Side note, Look at Heavy Leather Limbs over BoS Limbs - it's 32/77 vs 35/45, though it does suffer from CND issues
---
All I use are repair kits. I took off the perk cards that prolong weapon and armor condition. I can't get rid of them, I use them on all the items I place in my vendor and I still have over 175 on me plus another 40 in my stash. Yes, I can just drop them, which destroys them. I wouldn't mind having them if they had no weight associated to them.
---
That's awesome, thanks!  Now I can just grab more bullets are a train station instead of heading home first!
---
Usually when some mechanical mob goes ape, it's because it's Combat Inhibitor was hit. Generally a panel on the back of the torso. The give away is they will have sparks going off all over their body.  
---
Makes it attack everything and anything. Friendly, neutral, doesn't matter
---
Ever been doing a Mr. Messenger and it suddenly starts sparking, turns red and starts attacking you? That's why.
---
Eh, 2 points in a perk and it makes certain ammo types weigh literally zero. I'm good.
---
Thats when you line the whole base with rad emitters.
---
Yup, I have about 850 locked out.  This is half a fix.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Seems like a lot of work towards a relatively easy challenge.
---
There was set you could earn through nw that you can wear, I think you can still earn it by playing me.
---
About the SS Under armor... Definitely worth getting.  The shielded mod gives you +4 strength +2 perception and +4 endurance, and is 15/15/15.  Amazing really.
---
I love em.
---
Kind of weird since there is a taxidermy quest involved.
---
the should be giving atoms after every level past 100. which would incentivize people to play more.
---
I do have plans for the T45 pieces you said you were looking for in the original post.
---
I have about 850 locked out from when the bug was active. While it's appreciated this was patched quickly, this is half a fix.  Will you be crediting those atoms which went to the wrong balance?  It should be (relatively) easy, since you track when achievements were completed.
---
While I agree, never hurts to throw out there. Wasnt that hard, only took like 2 minutes given another challenge is to claim workshops.
---
I prefer to go to watoga, if you do the quest "mayor for a day" the robots patrolling watoga are no longer hostile to you so you can do the kills fast and easy.
---
I agree lol something  about the relaxing feel of this game that makes it good
---
I do tryhard bush wookie sometimes but with a slight tweak.....no weapon or armor.  Occasionally I'll manage to get the drop on someone who is equipped and take them out with my fists and no armor.  Not exactly easy to do but super satisfying, and I would think embarrassing if on the receiving end.
---
White springs got a major nerf sometime back. I stopped nuking there due to it. Only did when the collect all Flux was up.
---
I'll maybe kill one creature for a daily, but 5 or god forbid 9? Nope, hard pass. This one will get skipped like the kill a player one from yesterday. I will not give in to your insatiable bloodlust Todd.
---
That‚Äôs strange, mine‚Äôs gone too.
---
They patched it like a month ago.
---
You get nothing. Nothing at all. 
---
The SCORE dailies continue, you can complete them, but you get nothing for it.
---
If Lover's Embrace works like Well Rested and Well Tuned, you shouldn't have to reapply it on each log-in as long as the duration is still running.
---
What is this hanging tree of which you speak?
---
Put the cookie down, NOW!

Oh, wait, not that kind of heavy. Nevermind...

I‚Äôm not OP lol. Just piggybacked cause I saw you post about it.
---
Wouldn't feel forced at all:) I'll message you my GT so you can message when you're online.
---
It looks better to the investors if we log on daily, this is beginning to be standard in the game as a service industry. I agree it's annoying but from a business standpoint I get it.
---
No joke I think that player maybe me LOL I was just doing that event I believe it was yesterday there were a couple players there but it was the first time I ever saw the Mothman spawn at the top of the Lighthouse at the end of the event I did end up jumping off the light house right next to him LOL probably someone else but quite possibly me do you remember the players name
---
Why does jumping cost AP? It's absolutely ridiculous.
---
Rip, thanks
---
I can understand a lot of what you say there.
---
Ideally I'd like for us all to have no daily limits. Maybe the addition of seasons IS enough to have people logging in each day, and would mean they can remove the limits for all players?
---
They do offer exclusive discounts already by the way, it's just poorly advertised so most people don't realise. Those flash sale discounts that only last a day, are only visible to 1st members.
---
I think, anybody feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I don't think I know anyone that uses the fridge for it's actual purpose - it just looks nice. The collectron is true though, and that one isn't totally fair imo - especially now that they have variants that collect guns, chems, foods etc that are much more useful than the random junk of the santatron
---
at least you got a response. I've submitted 2 tickets and not even gotten the generic message you received.
---
And, for anyone else trying to be lazy like I wanted to... seems the answer is yes! Herd Mentality supposedly works even on a Team by yourself. Also, interesting/annoyingly, apparently Lone Wanderer does *not* work under the same conditions - can not be on a team *at all* for that, apparently. :/
---
Rip, that sucks
---
As of today for me.
---
Five tickets for auto completed score and only one automated response on the first one.
---
Paying to remove a timegate is the biggest problem with micro transactions these days. It‚Äôs a tactic often employed by mobile games. No thank you.
---
I think it‚Äôs level 50 on the SCORE board for the season rewards. It is a pretty nice looking tree with a skeleton hanging in a cage.
---
Every single player paid for the game.
---
Oh snap! The plants are back. Nice
---
* Help level up new players.  Act as an escort through White Springs, etc.
---
* Own every workshop on the same public server.  I've tried doing this a couple of times but every time I would start it I would either get disconnected or I would get the server maintenance warning.
---
* Collect every Asylum uniform.  Red and Forrest are the hardest to find.
---
* Collect every Magazine
---
* Collect every Bobblehead
---
* Collect every Plan
---
* Collect every Recipe
---
* Find the locations of all of the Dilbert Recipes without looking it up on the internet.  there are 12x of them and they look like pieces of paper rather than the recipe booklets.  I pick these up and sell them.  There are a lot of players who miss these.
---
* Walk/Explore every corner of the map and every interior instead of fast traveling.  I did this with my first character.  Some of my friends recently built new characters during the double-XP event and they are doing the quests over again.  They are discovering areas of the map that they forgot about or never explored.
---
* Collect 10K acid (Tanagra Town, Campfire Tales, etc.)
---
* Collect 10K lead (Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator Armour for lead ore, then smelt with acid)
---
I do the same... I‚Äôm not going into your sketchy vendor room. I‚Äôve been caught once in a trap camp and that was enough for me. This is the reason my vendors are in the open.
---
Sorry man, this was about a month ago
---
Because
---
To each their own, I prefer skins like the Responder's pump shotgun or the Starlet Sniper lever action.
---
Well if you'd like to see what it's like without them, please go try fallout 4 modded.  A game so unstable you cant even round the corner and about 12 FPS.
---
You on PC?
---
It would be good we just need the Cannery first. Then let them hopefully build upon it from there.
---
So....you just gave a weapon away to another player? That‚Äôs 100% on you, man.
---
Fair enough, I would prefer it if they were to just remove the timegate for us all. Regardless of 1st membership.
---
on pc having to hit run again to stop running before hitting crouch. just let crouch override me running.
---
I definitely agree that they should remove the daily limits but keep the cap for everyone. I hate dropping and selling legendaries because my stash is full but i can't get anymore scrip. It would make the grind actually feel rewarding, because even if I get crap from the purveyor I can go right back to getting scrip and hunting instead of stopping for the day.

Basically yes, but it was an agreed upon trade deal that the other player dishonoured.  Ok thanks.
---
I don‚Äôt got time for that. There are people w/ 7 to  30 accounts that got mules suspended and still play w/o penalty to their main accounts throughout the history of reddit fo76
---
Agreed and upvoted
---
True. I just think that 1st needs some more value added to it, aside from junk hoarding.
---
Oh honey...
---
Cool.  I think thats only a few more steps away.  (Next one up for me is the robot Ghillie)
---
Same reason there is a plethora of common FO4 outfits being sold for 500 Atoms in FO76.
---
Unfortunately, only their marketing department knows what that reason is, and why it makes sense to them.

Didn't play for two weeks, got to 100 in six days with double xp.

Try jumping for a couple of minutes and check if your pulse is elavated. Depending on you stamina you will at one point pass out if you kept jumping.
---
Yup, the optional step of beating the queen activates too.
---
i have the gully suit but it cant be worn with armor. then they give us gully armor n it cant be used for nw. what do u need gully paint for in adventure mode?
---
I wish there were "I'm here for the SCORE" t-shirts we could equip!  :D
---
I am. at work presently though.
---
No. You can wear the ghillie outfit in NW because armor unequips it. People already use that to hide in bushes. There‚Äôs a balance system. Hide but have no armor, or have armor but be spotted easier. It should not be that you can have literally every piece of armor blend in with the shrubs. You have to pick one of them.
---
I‚Äôve been on 1300 hours haven‚Äôt seen a trap base in at least 5 months I‚Äôve been in whitespring for at least 4 months haven‚Äôt seen much grieffing anymore ‚Äúpsst I know grieffing is not a real word ‚Äú

I think FO76 has past that stage

tfw I just did a quick calculation of how much gunpowder I have.
---
3200 x .05(WT)= 160(WT). 
---
HOLY SHIT! WHY IS THIS A MISC ITEM AND NOT JUNK!
---
also mining coins that you get from Load bearing weighs a whopping .10 (WT), and to get any of the good items, you will need 100 of them. so you are effectively caring almost 10 pounds of coins just to get something from the machine.
---
Its unethical but you cant prove they stole it so nothing you can do. People suck. This is why I only trade for caps or via courier :/
---
Especially since they go on to insult Bethesda in a comment because they were wrong lol.
---
Ha! I only really eat Corn Soup and Cranberry Relish nowadays. Corn Soup for the food/thirst reduction and a small AP bonus, Relish for a 25% XP bonus (!) while on a team with the Herbivore Mutation and the Strange in Numbers perk card active.
---
The Soup I carry around with me, the Relish gets stored in a fridge.
---
oh boy where to start...I guess the most annoying one is fps drops the game works fine for me in first hours and then just go into whole slideshow mode and at exactly this moments whole bunch of ghouls or scorch attack, like how tf I‚Äôm suppose to defend if I can‚Äôt even shoot or see who is attacking me game is lugging for me but not for them they just beat the shit outta me, also sometimes I can‚Äôt equip weapon I choose weapon but it don‚Äôt show up like in the middle of the fight literally I just run away from enemies while they again kick my ass, also fucking hate when hit not registering like you shot this asshole 4-5 times and nothing his health bar remains full, it‚Äôs more annoying when you fight him with melee weapons
---
Yes. They will do nothing about it.
---
I‚Äôll have plenty of ammo crafting later in the game
---
Level 332, 1100 hours, pre-ordered right after E3 2018.
---
Be careful. Crying players are killing the fun.
---
Honestly when it comes to Lead and Steel I say don't even keep any.. Just have a nice supply of acid. When you start to get low on ammo go to Lucky hole and then go collect some guns from mutants and make the ammo all in one go. It will only take about 30-40 minutes and you'll produce enough to last you for a few days. And never keep Bone or Ceramic, you only need those for camp items and it's super easy to go get when you need it. Same with Antiseptic, just go farm some as needed because you'll never need a lot at any given time. For Copper only keep some around if you craft energy ammo frequently, if not it's super easy to go get well over a hundred from the nodes at Solomon's Pond when needed, and those are server hoppable as well. That's how I keep my stash weight down anyway.
---
You don't ever really "Beat the game." you might finish a story line. You can drop as many nukes as you like. 1.1k hours in and still enjoying the game
---
Yeah, maybe instead of them making the easy game easier for YOU, just drop your junk in your stash before running off and making careless mistakes.
---
o def submit a ticket there, thats a bad one
---
exactly so whats the point of gully paint in adventure
---
All good hey so I'm new to Reddit how do I post pictures every time I try it says that the subreddit does not allow photos
---
I need to say this: if you play often, you don't need as much.
---
 No need to keep water or food in the stash, since the Wasteland provides and you won't starve/dehydrate. The same with meds. Just keep two disease cures and addictols. If you need more, have fun trying to find them: enjoy the game. 
---
You can have 50/100 when it comes to junk. The only ones you want to keep and hoarde are screws, lead and plastic. 
---
If you like to collect weapons but don't use them, mod them to their basic state. They'll be lighter. Even better if you find reduced weight versions (keep those).
---
If you want to collect or sell different sets of armor, mod them and make them ultralight. 
---
If you melee most of the time, sell gunpowder. People will buy it. 
---
Be sure to sell the type of junk that can't be bulked. You might have 300 circuits/asbestos/etc. which you don't need.
---
I figured as much, but I have wondered about it.  Happened several months ago.
---
Dunno, it's been a while and I nuked the FSP, I think nuking that is the optional objective along with killing her, so the story quest is just to fire a nuke.
---
Just did, I Know for sure that I've lost over 300-400 atoms the past couple of days
---
Drop the nuke on the cranberry bog on edge of drop site 9.
---
Just so you know, there are players who act as trusted Couriers.  They act as middlemen for trades.  I found out about this when one of our crew mentioned that he was doing this.  It takes more coordination, but it protects you from bad trades.
---
Basically, both sides gives the courier their end of the deal and then they pass the trade items to the new owners.
---
Aged, looks crippled
---
No fixes but I‚Äôve had a similar problem where it would forever be stuck searching for a world or something but never joining it. I‚Äôve contacted support and am waiting for a response
---
You can‚Äôt turn off the only death penalty in the game. You think that‚Äôs bad? Never played the original Everquest have you...
---
Ive heard while may other response are slow, they deal with atom problems pretty fast thru tickets. Good luck, I'd be pretty sad
---
Go to IMGUR and upload your picture then, then just copy and paste the url
---
So turn off the one single penalty for dying? This isn‚Äôt 4 where it puts you back to your last quicksave, or New Vegas where if you forgot to save within the past two hours you‚Äôre fucked. All you do in 76 is respawn. The dropped junk is your penalty for dying, just like losing progress was in the past games.
---
An ICBM with a nuke payload just wakes up the SBQ. I don't think a mininuke would do much of anything.
---
I know, but the _I am Become Death_ is the original "final" quest.
---
Even if he could, what rule was broken? He literally handed it over to him.
---
The only thing you could do is get them on a scammer list but only if you have proof. Text chat may be enough depending on what was said.
---
I love my robot vendors very much, just wish I could mute them somehow, and why is my red rocket firering off constantly? Seems like a waste of fuel in a world ravaged by resource wars. Unless it's moonwater(helium3) which would actually make a lot of sense since battles have taken place in the sea of tranquility in the fallout universe according to the plague in museum of freedom in fo4. End of rant.
---
Great guide! Clear and concise and covers the basics.
---
A few more things I'd add:
---
Make sure you scrap all junk before stashing. Never store junk items.
---
Sort your misc tab by weight and keep an eye out for: mainframe cores if you do silos, presents or pails, those super mutant body parts from the waste disposal and things like tokens (not claim tokens which you use at Lode Baring). All of these can be dropped and weigh a lot.
---
Sell all grenades, except the floater ones you can't sell and only keep a handful of those on you if you use them
---
Plans add up quick. Unless you are actively hunting rare plans and/or grinding events, most of the plans you have are worthless. Drop them in a train station for low levels.
---
I drop any fusion core less than 50%. They are plentiful enough that you will always have more than enough unless you always use PA.
---
Thank you for the post üëçüèº as I can‚Äôt get on rn.. üòè
---
They put out a tweet stating the extra dailies will continue for the duration of the season.
---
Post-apocalyptic irradiated wasteland, mate, post-apocalyptic irradiated wasteland.
---
This is a great list! Quick question: why collect 10k of the last two resources specifically?
---
Sounds like a scratch on the disc. Is it happening with other games?
---
'Knowingly' has absolutely nothing to do with it. You could pick up something you find in a suitcase somewhere, think it's legit, and bam! Thanks for your money, here's a 'temp suspension' see ya when we see ya. 
---
They don't care about your intentions. If they detect anything at all you're gone. They snap your account out of existence and never answer any of your tickets. They ghost you in two ways. It's both extremely frustrating and kinda funny at the same time. Meanwhile actual dupers out there not getting detected at all just skate by without a hint of concern as they sell their duped items to other players online for real world money.
---
It's ridiculous. And people like you on your high horse would be exactly like us if you got scooped up for the smallest infraction. I'm sure you've been in possession of something questionable or shady in your time playing, but keep pretending you're so virtuous. It's actually giving me a genuine laugh right now.
---
&gt;Check your Aid tabs. Get rid of unwanted Aid by selling it to a robot vendor or by simply dropping it. Keep up to 10 of the most common items like Purified Water or drugs like Buffout. Keep up to 25 for high usage or rare items like RadAway and Psychotats. Keep up to 25-50 (Super-)Stimpaks, depending on your Strength and Endurance. Again, sort by weight afterwards to check if you've missed any heavy items left.
---
This.  Figured this out in FO4 when I was always at or near the weight limit then I saw that I had a ton (like 80+) of Psycho, Med-X, etc that I never used.  I keep everything to 10 now and sell the rest.
---
Nope
---
In my case my problem was that the silly wire of the power generator was going through the building obstructing a tiny bit of where the door was supposed to be I realized that only because I was trying to put some posters on the wall when I noticed the wire.
---
Another person mentioned the awful POV that door has, you have to rotate it because apparently it appears the other way around when you select it, rotating it 180¬∞ will solve the issue and it should fit right in... if nothing is in the way.
---
Literally why there are stash and scrap boxes.
---
This is good to know.  Thanks.
---
Actually there is totally something we can do about this. It costs 1000 caps though sadly. Just give me the caps and I'll get your gun back.
---
They didn‚Äôt take your pure flux, it disappears upon death
---
Lol this whole post is sarcasm, I don‚Äôt just bait low level players into PvP. I just run around and try to pick fights with anyone and everyone. I don‚Äôt care if they are level 1000. But I do love to bait low level players into PvP as well. I also like to get a bounty just to have players try to come kill me. I had a 20 cap bounty last night and had a higher level player come try to kill me with his gauss shotgun only for me to melt him and take his junk. Which included bulk adhesive lol.
---
Unless its changed, No, you are not required to launch on fissure prime.  
---
If you have the mission, you can complete scorched earth simply by participating in the event, regardless of who launched.
---
I did several queen fights before i launched for the first time (on Toxic valley).  
---
Got credit for both.
---
You still can get 1star dragons from monster mash candy rewards, but RNG ofc
---
This. Almost like it's a survival game, right?
---
The comment I replied too seemed genuine.
---
Good additions. Never ever keep food or water in your Stash. Food spoils, and water is around plenty. And yeah, all of my armor pieces are Ultra-light, must have. (They're also Unyielding, so that increases carry weight as well, but not everybody likes a Bloodied build.)
---
Sweet. I'll do that! I'm sure I have the mats and I'd appreciate the crap out of it!
---
He means lvl 40ish in Nuclear Winter. Level 15 in NW gives you a Blue Camo that's compatible with excavator, too.
---
There are few things more rewarding than reading the baseless statements of someone who is allergic to punctuation.
---
Ok.  Well it happened months ago I just wanted to know technically.   I had a screenshot of the player.  I made an official complain but never heard anything from Bethesda.
---
Get some solution that you would clean glasses with and soft towel, clean off the disc that might help.
---
Reminds me of that scene in reign of fire where McConaughey tries to fight a dragon with a fire axe. 
---
Sick pic!
---
I'd say dropping literal junk is the very least of PvP problems this game has.
---
Okay I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of cool pictures lately but this is one of the coolest, at least top 2
---
Thanks for the tip
---
What it's for right?
---
I‚Äôm with you! I had to drop 200 repair kits a while ago! Takes up too much weight after a while. Still got 160 to burn through. I‚Äôll even use em up when I first log in to repair all weapons and armour even if it‚Äôs not really require.
---
No problem
---
this son of a bitch is pretty tough, attacked me while I was just chillin in the woods minding my business
---
Thank you
---
Because NW is a ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùcompetitive‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù PvP game, where Adventure is 99.99999% PvE. You can wear a bright pink dress with sparklers attached to it and poke a deathclaw with a stick and it won‚Äôt do so much as notice you. In NW, you‚Äôre actually going against other, real people. Bush Wookiee or protection. You can have one or the other. Not both.
---
The point of being able to have that in Adventure is because it literally doesn‚Äôt matter. It gives you no advantage. It‚Äôs just a cosmetic.
---
Thanks man, I just hope this brings attention to the issue. Because I would hate for this to happen to someone who actually pays for Atoms. Im a little pissd because it's wasted grinding, but imagine loosing actual cash.
---
If you're on xbox I got you. I got a spare plan :)
---
&gt; Make sure you scrap all junk before stashing. Never store junk items.
---
This is so important, I've edited it in. Thanks!
---
The original limb prime skins costed 1800 atoms I know coz I brought it
---
Xbox? It wouldnt be the greatest version but I have one I could sell you. :)
---
This is a contest winning pic
---
Thanks.  This happened months ago and wanted to know if it was technically against game rules.  But thanks.
---
You're right.
---
Ive also read that fo1st atoms are messed up sometimes too. People post about not getting them a fair anount and thats where ive also seen people say they respond fast with atom tickets
---
Durability isn‚Äôt judged on shots fired? I can‚Äôt even.....I mean....*why?!*
---
I couldn‚Äôt remember what the original price was I bought it for 1500 on sale but still asking for 1200 atoms for one skin that is o my grey is so ridiculous

Dang. Guess I'll go off myself since this dude won't give me any sympathy. Goodbye cruel world...and scumbags...üòÇ
---
escape artist could be bugged (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hv9dar/update_on_problems_sneaking/). wasnt able to test it but it would be an explanation why i keep getting spotted with 38 AGI
---
Bulking Acid gives you a little bit more Acid as well. You should only Bulk Acid, Aluminum, and Lead.
---
Agree with all this. Gunpowder can be sneaky and weigh you down fast. I usually keep about 50 on me as I don't make much Ammo.
---
For Junk you really need screws, gears, springs, aluminum, and ballistic fiber to repair guns and armor. PA needs other stuff but I don't use it often so I'm not sure what.
---
Everything else can be found more easily (collecting screws, gears, and springs to build PA is a pain in the butt).
---
Also with junk check to make sure you don't have unjunked items. Stuff like scrap assaultron heads and sheepsquatch bones are heavy and don't auto scrap.
---
The fallout first paint armour blends kinda nice in the right bush with the yellows and oranges... I think we got that last month?
---
The official term for this type of person is ‚Äúescrow‚Äù in case you need this is real life
---
That isn‚Äôt at all what I said nor does it relate to what I asked you so I believe you are mistaken.
---
As far as I am aware, and your link doesn‚Äôt prove otherwise, is that you are not allowed to make a new Bethesda account to evade a ban. I never said you couldn‚Äôt own the game twice.
---
Most online games have a policy against someone evading a ban and I have seen numerous people throughout this sub bring it up in the past.
---
Unless you can find me the exact part of the TOS that states you are explicitly allowed to evade a ban, I can‚Äôt just dismiss the idea.
---
Wow I hear a lot of people praising the Chinese Stealth Armor but not a lot about the Secret Service armor
---
I‚Äôm running bolstering polished heavy metal.  
---
117DR on the chest, 54 on the arms.  Legs are not not heavy metal, so only getting DR 45 there.
---
With Shielded BOS underarmor, DR is about 330, with SS shielded, its about 335, but b/c I have the high capacity backpack, ER/RR is on the low side.  Still squishier than I‚Äôd like in some locations, so I sometimes end up back in Excavator.
---
Not sure if it was sparking or not. It was red at the very beginning before it became damaged lol. I guess the other bots were still passive since it didn't attack them yet. Idk.
---
others have answered so I won't be bothered with that, but know that the vast majority of players are honorable, so don't let one arse ruin your playthrough..
---
...having said that, you still have to be careful..but you've already learned that lesson. 
---
peace!
---
The only thing that worries me are the rank ups for atoms. It's like they're giving a carrot and if you're very close you might end up just paying to rank up to get the end. 
---
If you have no clue what I'm talking about when you check your legendary run map, look at the bottom and it gives an option that says "rank" and if you select it, it offers to rank you up one level at the cost of 150 atoms. In theory you can just pay "x amount of dollars" and get to the end instantly if you wanted to look at it that way =\\
---
Lately, there's almost ALWAYS a survival tent nearby at Scorched Earth. After killing the queen, that should be your first stop. Hit up the stash box, and then kill mobs or be killed to your heart's content!
---
Absolutely thank you!
---
ehh...would have rathered something better for first n only paint for ss armor. just like t65 atom paint is kinda garbage too.
---
Nah, I have no fear of fighting against people with legacy weapons or any gear. I literally spent two hours PvPing with a guy in front of the wayward who had way better gear than me. Including a full set of assassins armor. He killed me about 20 times in a row. Lost a bunch of caps. Don‚Äôt care though. He even had a buddy join in and they double teamed against me. It was good fun though. I finally pulled out my quad Tesla and killed him once or twice though.
---
Tell me about it, I shot one bullet and he narutoed his ass to me and my friend, we didnt even get a chance to react at first
---
Thank you. At the suggestion of another redditor I uploaded it to the Around Appalachia to see if it's selected to be featured anywhere
---
&gt;Edit: but, hey, why not have SCORE challenges reward atoms again?
---
There would be *massive* outrage (and people would be perfectly justified for it, imo) if people who bought out the board or dumped massive amounts of time into grinding XP like it was their job got "rewarded" by being showered in premium currency until the Season was over. We already know what the rewards are supposed to be; anything more would be see an unfairly favoring players who have money to toss at the game.
---
I'm hoping we'll get our regularly-scheduled atom challenges in the short amount of time between Seasons, but obviously we don't know how Bethesda will be handling that yet.
---
As a rule, I don't trade with strangers, ever, for this reason. Trust no one in the wasteland with your hard-earned gear!
---
Why do you need literally anything from the Atomic Shop in Adventure? Especially the cosmetics. Nobody ‚Äúneeds‚Äù the veteran ranger armor, nobody ‚Äúneeds‚Äù to look like a small Liberty Prime. People just want to *look* like how they want. It‚Äôs that simple.
---
If you dont think it is worth it then dont pay for it...?
---
Just a bit of a piss take isn‚Äôt it way too much. They tested the water with the pricing off the Chinese power armour skin charging 1400 then when the red rocket one came out it costed 1500. They probs testing to see how high they can charge and get a lot of people to buy. Wouldn‚Äôt make sense to charge 1400 for one and then 1500 for another. I know this is off topic but just throwing it out there
---
That's what I'm hoping. I've been playing without any help since launch which has been a lot of fun. But I've been looking for the appropriate guns and armor all summer so I could face the queen solo... and I'm still looking lol
---
So I'm just hoping to clear the quest and worry about the queen another day.
---
Thanks yes!
---
Here it is, it's best from memory.

---
People will have their own opinions about what to use, but in my opinion this works the best for me. You're basically going to cycle crits for this build.
---
Strength is a throwaway perk, I don't really use it tooooo much.
---
Perception is your damage perks, plus your Concentrated fire.
---
Endurance is where I change from most people, I use ironclad, it's more like a backup in case I do take damage. You can take a point or two out, it's preference.
---
3 points in charisma, tenderizer for damage, also can swap out inspirational for the xp buff (I'm pretty sure inspirational works even if you're in your own public group)
---
Intelligence is 3, I just use gunsmith, but the 3 let's you lockpick and hack.
---
Agility is 14, action boy/girl is a must to stay in vats. Sneak perks, gun fu rank 2 (bit controversial since most only take rank 1 just for the target swapping), and 2 ranks in adrenaline when it's fixed.
---
Luck should focus on keeping you in vats and pumping out crits. I'd go for 4 leaf clover, grim reapers, and critical savvy rank 2. Crit damage and starched genes too.
---
For some reason, rank 2 and rank 3 of crit savvy work pretty much the same for me. If 4 leaf clover doesn't activate, it takes 2 normal shots to get a crit. Critical savvy makes criticals use less crit points, but even with the reduction in rank 3, I have like 5 crit points still needed after my first shot. (I know that part is confusing, basically, rank 2 and rank 3 require 2 normal shots to get a crit shot, the reduction from rank 3 is just barely not enough to make it every other shot)
---
For mutations, I use bird bones (agility) , eagle eyes (crit damage), marsupial, speed demon and grounded. The best part? You don't need class freak. Your strength can't get below 1, so the -8 strength from the mutations don't effect you. Same goes for the intelligence. Just run starched genes and you're good.
---
Armor wise, honestly you can just run the Chinese stealth armor and you'll be good. You can work your way up to AP refresh/chameleon armor. I was lucky enough to get a chameleon and AP refresh secret service chest piece. I've never really bothered with armor too much, I would just prefer chameleon as the primary and a few AP refresh gear.
---
Weapon wise, I have 2 lever actions. Don't bother with hunting rifles, levers outclass it. 
---
My first is my Instigating, 33 vats hit, less vats lever. It can 1-2 shot a level 61 super mutant with sneak and crits. Even a 1* instigating lever action is amazing. 
---
My second is my Anti Armor, 50 Vats Crit, Less Vats cost. I use this for basically any stronger enemy, plus the queen. 
---
This is pretty much all I really say, I know it's a lot of information but I have a lot of time sunk into this build. Again, any specific questions let me know!
---
You can use it to move around alot of stuff (by placing items on top of the rug) and also to connect (in some cases the rug works to connect for example roofs, it changes the priority. Honestly hard to explain in text lol).
---
Just seems weird mentioning several times that you bait in level 15's but when called out on it. Story changes. Hey man you do you pvp isn't for everyone.
---
Yes it does. The issue is it maxes at 90% and the 3 perk points give u 75%. If u run full HTD you can take off those 3 points.
---
I'm not sure about those discounts only being for First members. Has anyone confirmed this?
---
And yeah, I'm hoping the Legendary Run is a runaway success for them so they can ease up on some of the gameplay restrictions (yeah I know wishful thinking). The fact that they are adding challenges for the remainder of the run means enough people paid to complete it thus far that they can be a little lax with it. Cause you know that they had a bottom line that they had to meet of people paying to complete for it to be profitable. Though I can say that since the Legendary Run has come out the atom shop has been pretty lame, so I'm concerned they are just trying to take the same amount of content and spread it out over the the atom shop and legendary run, but that's another issue entirely.
---
Thanks! This may be what I'm doing this weekend.
---
Instead of a Can i would rather you preserve food in Mason Jars.
---
Sorry for any grammar or spelling issues I‚Äôm in phone so funny auto correct and I don‚Äôt know how to turn it off. And the end says bow* is Fuckin op lol.
---
PC. but thanks for offering.
---
He started on space 30. The run is 70 days long. 30+70=100
---
If you play the match from bush to bush and seek out only creatures it is not that hard.  Creatures tend to appear more often as the fire gets closer to you too.
---
Since we're on the topic, is it possible to suppress another players ability to player vs player trade?  Like, the option to trade with the person doesnt appear when you're next to them.
---
So it's both a good and a bad thing. It means using guns and missing lots of shots doesn't penalize you. But it's also bad because things with explosive damage, or barrel splitters cause the wear to increase exponentially. For shotgun, this isn't an issue because their base durability seems to account for this as they can go through hundreds of shots and still be in good condition. Whereas the Laser Rifle on its own is rather fragile. But if you throw a splitter on it it will break in under 200 shots hit. Since these guns don't account for how many times they'll hit an enemy. 
---
You can see this in action by having a rocket launcher, firing at a faraway target. And as soon as the rocket hits, your launcher will break. It's kind of stupid but in all honesty, it's only bad for explosive weapons and the laser rifle with barrel splitter.
---
I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve said it. But I think when he get to the end that will mark the end of the season. This is only week four so you have plenty of time to catch up with weeklies being the big push each week. Just do everything and get the repeatable at least once and you should be fine.
---
Have you ever heard of r/all?
---
Seriously? Damn, you really learn something new everyday. :)
---
The game doesn‚Äôt end...
---
I always thought that's just the spawn point for them.
---
Well I can confirm if I wear full chameleon with 1 piece sneak or full HTD Uny. Have both sets. I can remove the sneak perks and suffer no loss in the way I‚Äôm detected.
---
Are you on PC or console? I‚Äôm on PC I haven‚Äôt had my game crash yet. I‚Äôve only experienced minor bugs like being overweight after dying.
---
Good additions, but I still keep Lead and Steel (admittedly I have a Scrap Box). But if you do need Steel (and Wood), you can also do Uranium Fever or Line in the Sand (leave that freaking turret un-repaired!). Those are the two easiest events for me to get those resources, at least. Just collect every weapon dropped by enemies. Waddle over to the nearest workbench and scrap them all (go into the Weapons tab!). Be sure to put the Scrapper perk card on.
---
Did you sleep at all in those six days?
---
Here's an album I made of it.  
---
http://imgur.com/a/LkOvpD0
---
Yeah and while ammo weight can be reduced by perks or legendary effects, gunpowder cannot. Better to make the ammo you know you will use and carry a ton of it around than to sit on a pile of gunpowder.
---
None of those glitches were actually all that useful,if not at the very first levels,like before 200.  After that, those glitches were just inefficient, I know because I tried them and they were not worth the time(and my controller would have exploded as well).
---
The real glitch was god mode,that was patched last week. That made possible to have unlimited xp buffs and no xp caps on enemies or quests xp.
---
They've played since beta, most likely. I've played since beta and my first character is level 130-150 ish (it's been a while), my second is at 173 and my current is level 51. I've seen up to 800, though. There's ways to boost XP, too and Bethesda does double XP events every now and then too. You can make a ton of progress during these if you know how to work it and increase XP gains. Make use of public teams, too. Building teams are the best IMO, b/c the intelligence boost increases XP. Edited to say, though, that it isn't a race. Enjoy at your own pace. Once you've hit 50, the levels don't really do as much, other than give leeway for redistributing points.
---
Are you fucking serious?  They've repeatedly rereleased the original fridge on sale AND have released several reskins and new models with the same exact functionality.
---
Stop trying to stir shit.
---
Sorry I don't remember exactly. I want to saw traveling leather coat or hunter's coat.
---
PC. I should have mentioned that. I crashed fighting Alpha in Project Paradise about an hour ago and crashed about 10 times yesterday.
---
Funny thing is, we don't exactly know when the end date is (sometime mid-September'ish). I think the ship is a bit ahead of where you would actually need to be. I found this quick guide by u/LifeKeru to be the most helpful -- [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary\_run\_score\_rundown\_guide/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) .
---
Do workarounds like this help devs figure out the source of the problem
---
The best information about it can be found in Bethesda‚Äôs site. But someone will provide
---
Escape artist was fixed in Patch 19, but I guess its possible they broke it again.  Personally, I haven't had any stealth issues with 22 AGI  and one armor piece with harder to detect while sneaking.  
---
Artificial light sources are the biggest hindrance to stealth.  Bright daylight doesn't matter...but if you go near an overhead light, you'll be spotted in seconds.
---
I got the lim prime skin when it first dropped where you get two for one and it was cool to start with and fun but after a while it just got crap with no way of shutting it up it kinda drags after a while and loose it novelty but it was fun to use at the start. I‚Äôd say save your atoms tbh for something else or for the other lim prime skins to come back round so you get more for your money
---
So you got screwed out of two loot drops, then managed to get a third and decided to fight a wendigo colossus? Sounds like you could have used an option to turn off poor decisions.
---
I know but there‚Äôs not a solid date there
---
Poor wording on my part- I figured most people would get that I was talking about the end of the og main quest. Sorry.
---
What‚Äôs your setup? Because my friend kept crashing because his cpu was out of date.
---
The unwritten rule to follow through on verbal agreements and not be a dick
---
It's as if community is a diverse group of people where not everyone is the same... But sure, let's take out this minor penalty of losing mostly worthless junk that's easy to replace just because you can't be bothered to deposit it, then force players to repair all the time and grind repair materials.

It hasn't tickled your pickle until your private server crashes mid legendary transfer between toons.
---
No, I saw it on a player last week and thought it looked really sharp. Was quite large and darker coloured with blue and had the logo on it.
---
I'll have to see if I can find it again.
---
Edit - I can't find it online...I wonder now if I saw it on an NPC and assumed it was in the game. Was really nice.
---
That's awesome! Really looks like a bear attack!
---
Yeah I was saying the same thing as you in another post a long time ago, and there were people without 1st saying they couldn't see the discounts I mentioned, people with 1st could.
---
But I don't know if it was just that 1 week a long time ago, or if it's all the time.

---
I hate using a mic. English isn't my native language, I'm german, and for reasons only those morons find funny it apparently never gets old to make dumb nazi jokes. It wasn't funny when the internet was still young and it most definitely isn't funny today.
---
All I want is basic text chat. I would even be fine with a way to send messages to other players via the social menu but not even that is possible unless you play on consoles. 
---
Jesus Christ...
---
Have the jet pack? Have the best mods for the SS armor?
---
Really? Sometimes it goes off for me and I have to reapply. I don't think I am misremembering, but it seems like those buffs elapse when offline, whereas a lot of the buffs only tick down when online.
---
It broke like 2 days after it came out an was broken for a while.
---
Yeah fuck the penitentiary. I hate finding my way through there.
---
and yet here we are. Nothing else I play crashes.
---
The last 2 tabs are there though... I don't have F1 so I can't put it up...
---
time to make a bunch of .45 ammo. the fixer aint going to feed itself
---
Farmable dirt tiles.  Organized farming
---
Beautiful shot with that atmosphereüëç, no wonder many worship the great mothman
---
Only way this would be legit question is if you were comparing a junkies vs instigating.

I already admitted to baiting level 15 players into PvP. It‚Äôs fun. If someone gets their feelings hurt about dying to PvP in a game then they shouldn‚Äôt be playing an open world online game. I can only imaging how they handle the real world lol. I don‚Äôt exclusively only pick fights with low levels. I actually look at the map and normally find a high level player who is at their camp and fast travel there. Then proceed to punch them over and over hoping they‚Äôll take the bait. At which point it‚Äôs ‚Äúmay the better man win‚Äù. If they don‚Äôt like PvP then they don‚Äôt have to fight back. Low level players obviously don‚Äôt know the rules so they just instantly pull out their little pipe pistol and start shooting. I find it funny. I like seeing their reactions. If you know the rules of PvP and don‚Äôt want to PvP then here‚Äôs some ideas... 1. Don‚Äôt fight back if you get baited... 2. Don‚Äôt go after a player with a bounty... 3. Don‚Äôt take a workshop.
---
That‚Äôs bizarre
---
Try playing on console
---
Yeah got jet pack, all mods for the guns and armour too (well the ones worth getting for my build).  Didn‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything else worth getting that I‚Äôve missed?
---
I was thinking that is the case that once you get there they give nothing and frankly it is nice getting a little something as long as you don‚Äôt stress about it.  All that said, hats off to the folks who are done I am on the slow train chugging along.
---
It's not really. My friend also plays and she crashes several times a day as well.
---
I tried doing that as well but it never worked. I finally got it to work today after unfriending them, re-friending them, un-installing the game, reinstalling, and then sending a close friend request. I guess it's some sort of bug. I've been having tons of issues with fallout 1st
---
Pretty much all PA does as well
---
Cool, I will have a look getting these. Thanks.
---
Boy you need a bigger backpack
---
I get pvp and how it works just saying it's not pvp if your baiting level 15s
---
I don't think it's that. I never bought the game through bethesda net. I have it on steam. Plus the Atoms were showing up, but then just poofing into thin air when I actually went into the Atomic Shop.
---
Edit: Actually It might be. Reading some of the comments people are having similar issues but not exactly the same.
---
Rip and tear!
---
I must be lucky I‚Äôve never had my game crash.
---
Yeah but i don't want to do those tadpole quests
---
I love these underground camps, I've never had a single one that was a trap and usually the owners are so excited to show you around! Dump your junk and take a chance, what's the worst that could happen? A load screen?
---
August 18-24 according to this:

---
What is meat week?
---
If they're putting up the Greenhouse bundle again, I would hope they were going to fix the bug with moving/scrapping it but I guess not.
---
You done did it now. I'm sorry.
---
Rocksy annoys me. 
---
"Yous no flake, me impressed". 
---
No shit lady, I think we've established that several weeks ago when I murdered the first of a couple dozen cunts you wanted gone.
---
And yes, screw the penetentiary.
---
A large part of it is your gun and how loud it is. For example, a suppressed hunting rifle is substantially louder than a suppressed combat rifle. Bows and flamers (for some reason) are essentially silent.
---
Super Sledge has a rocket on it and is far noisier than say a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Just the image I was looking for tysm
---
Rocks understands why we're all here, sometimes you just gotta beat someone down
---
I have problem with copying the project76 file. It ask's for the admin permission to copy but I can't change them for the file, I treid it on both of my accounts that I have on my PC, both have full access to administration.
---
I've had Well Rested/Tuned prematurely end on log-off a couple times, but I'm assuming that's just a glitch-- for the most part, they stick.
---
Bit late to the party, but nice print! I love seeing my designs out in the wild.
---
On a side note, how do you keep from getting hurt with the jet pack?  I have bird bones mutation.  Is that enough?  I play bloodied at 19% health and would hate to kill myself a bunch.
---
Thankyou
---
Interesting, sorry my fix didnt work!
---
Well I skipped the 9 creature last time, but this time I did all 5 in one game.
---
What a fucking joke lol
---
-100% damage is -100% i know its weird coming from bethesta
---
Because you asked what to do before the next event.  Doing the last two will put you in a great position to build all of the ammo that you need...  (grin)
---
Once you run out of the 10K of lead making ammo, you can use Lucky Hole mine and the 10K of acid to make more.
---
With Beth luck it would delete the item you transmogrified giving you the rich taste of Todd.
---
Probably could also find a way to transmog armor gear into weapons to wear and become Rambo.
---
Being that Vanguard itself is not that good (If base armour is around the 300 mark) due to diminishing returns, adding another 250 is even more so.
---
That said, if you have a Quad single action revolver, then yes, in that case, 250DR while reloading is good.
---
That's pretty shitty when it's pictured in the bundle images. I guess I didn't read the text but still..
---
Especially when the images are rather large and the text is small.
---
I don't understand but am low on ammo.
---
I can safely say its not just the linked accounts. I have the game on steam and never bought or played it on the Bethesda launcher, I have no character or never logged in through a friends or anything, I am as far distanced from the Bethesda launcher version of the game as you can possibly be and I was having the same issue unit I launched the game today where I found out my 450 that would normally be there (Until I went into the store and they reverted to 0 again) weren't and it was set to 0. It works no and I can spend  points without it telling me I don't have them. But I lost 450-500 odd like they were just removed from my account. An no it wasn't to do with the purchases going though that I tried to make because I only tried buying one thing and It was only 150 Atoms an was only tried once.
---
Unlimited ammo probably but fallout 1st is required
---
 To store that muchSteel is easiest mat to get.
---
Cattle prod if you think you‚Äôll ever go melee. I enjoy mine. If not hang on to em. Maybe BGS will eventually expand what‚Äôs available to purchase like other weapons, CAMP stuff, etc.
---
Yea, they should just go the Guild Wars 1 route.  Each level from 1 - 20 (the max) needed increasing EXP, but once you hit 20, it was the same amount of EXP to level every time.  This is essentially the same effect as scaling EXP to player level without them having to do more math.
---
I‚Äôve jinxed myself lol
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
Fix it or don't fix it.  I don't care... but don't tie challenges to a mode that the game explicitly says is a BETA.  Challenges should be something like "Kill a legendary in adventure mode or kill another player in NW:  0/1".  Tying any challenge exclusively to NW/PVP is asinine.
---
Escape artist is always useful since it adds a unique effect (run while sneak doesn't cause noise) and there's no other way to get this effect. As for the sneak cards, yes they add extra snarkiness on top of 30+ agility but in practice you don't really need them since you should be silent enough at that point not to worry.
---
Power armor. Fusion cores. Rad-x and/or radaway. Stimpaks if you‚Äôre collecting lots of junk.
---
I think after giving this advice to several redditors they hadnt had issues. After server reset, log in direct to adventure mode, dont go to atom shop or anywhere else, wait about 5 minutes before opening the map after load.
---
Seems like for some, as soon as they load into an area they immediately open the map to look at challenges, but they are still loading for them. Similar to fast traveling to your camp after being in world for awhile, but not having been there since entering the world, it will just then load the camp for you to see. It seems to be the same for the challenges. 
---
So once in the world, wait about 5 minutes, then open challenges to see them.
---
I was on my private server when this happened to me, but what I can‚Äôt understand is why I keep coming across other players dropped loot?
---
You can do the queen event without any special equipment. If you want to go in to nuke zones you will need a hazmat or power armor.  I use the stealth armor from wastelanders and love it.
---
If you really want to avoid having to go to the penitentiary server hop, it will pick a new location.  That said, the new location could end up being the penitentiary again lol.  More often than not it won't be though.
---
I usually start my dailies round at crater so if I don't like where I'm being sent for tubes I can go do the rest of my dailies first.  Since I usually server hop anyways every so often I finish the other ones and then hop if I want the location to get re-rolled.
---
This is the only NW daily that's a major fucking pain in the ass. Good luck even finding the damn things. And it's counter intuitive to the mode, you're not supposed to be going around hunting monsters with guns blazing like Rambo.
---
Trial and error. Once you learn how to use it correctly you should not hurt yourself.
---
I only get damage when there are lots of players around causing lag, the jetpack goes crazy and it becomes a rocket.
---
Beta? Only if üòÇ This game is a Zeta if I ever did see one.
---
I could see this being highly used by stealth suit people... LOVE my stealth suit, but absolutely hate I can't equip anything over it
---
thhe problem is, when I open the shop the wrong amount is displayed, hence why it won't let me buy anything.
---
Im a full health build and I‚Äôve got 2 pieces of armour that has reduce fall damage. But I‚Äôve just found this for bloodied build, maybe this could help you?
---
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gaef7r/spoiler_information_regarding_the_new_jet_pack/
---
That's really weird. Maybe it's lagging from other servers that you were recently in
---
because if there wasn't you'd buy everything in a week
---
I was on my way down from the lighthouse just as the Mothman spawned up there, right at the balcony, but by the time I went to photomode, he'd landed. Such a missed opportunity. I really need to get that camera üòñ Congrats on a great capture üëçüëçüëç
---
I'm using a silenced fixer and a handmade for comparison, though. I also converted my heavy build into a sneak build with an explosive flamer and it draws a lot more attention than my handmade.
---
explosive legendaries in general seem to be noisy. my 25 fixer is more silent than any explosive variant I tested.
---
Best option, the queens buggy as hell. You could disconnect as they're pretty common in that fight.
---
Sounds like they were trying not to upset anyone, and created a broken system as a result. Players should be penalised for the shots they miss, if durability has to be a factor at all.
---
There is a BBQ event every hour and special rewards, mostly outfits last time.
---
I'm rocking a Clean Miners Helmet.
---
Yes, its unfortunate that during the apocalypse some may become raiders.  If they were intended to be there they'd be in the game......oh
---
Anything to let me hide my backpack for the outfits that have cool designs on the back. What fucking moron thought that was a good idea?
---
How soon?
---
Is there a 5k cap on bullion? If so, do you know how many treasury notes we can store?
---
Radiation protection(stealth armor or power), heavy weapon(it‚Äôs almost impossible to get the reward from the sb if you don‚Äôt have one), and stimpaks.
---
I'm going to start doing that.  That's a pro tip.  I just cannot stand the penitentiary.
---
Thanks!! And thanks for making the model available
---
Buy all serum recipes and get all vendor plans/recipes. I‚Äôm at 850 hours and have a few more serums to go. It is a hell of a grind
---
Most people who have all serums took advantage of the scorchbeast queen dropping the plans in the first months of the game. I was not able to get on that grind. Too busy enjoying the game. But it costs so much and sales in multiplayer vendors have dropped substantially since adding gold bullion. So good luck on that one. I used to sell 10-15k a day. Now I make maybe 2k a day if that at all. And I have a very good store imo. 
---
Pioneer is good list. I have two that are broken. Kill scorchbeast queen challenge and the challenge to restore power to a power plant. I‚Äôve done both 1000 times and they still won‚Äôt complete. I‚Äôve even done SBQ on private server all by myself and still no challenge complete. Wonder how others get it to work. 
---
Your list is good
---
I‚Äôd add. Get all the MR fuzzy token prizes from the theme park.  Takes 150 days total (one character 3 tokens per day)to get enough tokens just for the mascot uniform and mask(450 tokens total or maybe it‚Äôs 500?)
---
I spend a lot of time on this game too, I kill my self before the enemies get a chance lol.
---
Cool, I don‚Äôt think I did it last time. So will all be new to me lol thanks
---
Yeah getting really pissed off with this one.
---
Now on my 4th match. 2 kills in. Like I‚Äôve got nothing better to do with my evening.
---
Great now I have to put up with some dude with 31 kills too. Yes, we know you‚Äôre cheating we can see it. Piss off!
---
Um? How does that justify anything? With that stupid cap it would take months to get a full set of armor.
---
I'm pretty sure buillon will be the main currency of end-game items going forward, they can't make a new currency every major update, so save them
---
I always find myself feeling a bit oppressed by the seared wasteland of Ash Heap. Its just dark and gloomy in a purely man-made industrial sort of way. For some reason, its really the only zone that has any notable effect on me when im there. Just a perfect demonstration of "people are stupid" and its consequences.
---
Your progress for the legendary run isn‚Äôt on all characters, only the character You unlocked the progress has the items. This is extremely stupid. Why even progress if only one character receives rewards
---
Zooming in as far as I can on this phone, it looks like the Nuka Lady space outfit thingymajiggy.
---
That's sick man
---
Lol. My first thought as well. That‚Äôs a terrifying grind.
---
Chinese stealth armour is what I use for nuked zones.
---
I mean, if what ADynes said is correct, which I have my doubts about, then a full HTD set is still only 75%.
---
awesome, thank you!
---
You can turn in 20 notes per day. In a week, including the Gold you buy from Smiley is 1800 Gold per week.
---
It adds up. I've bought over 15,000 gold worth of stuff so far.
---
Quite.
---
SS costs more then the T-65 due to needing to buy the mods for increasing DR as well as mod for jet pack and others.
---
T 65 is a better choice since you don‚Äôt have to create 58 pieces of one piece of gear trying to get unyielding on SS like me.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on, I‚Äôve even changed my PS4 pro drive to a ssd hoping for the game to run smoother.
---
great, will look for hazmat suit on my next outing then, i feel weird in the pa since im not specd for it at all
---
Cheers, think I might get the tiles then save them. Is it capped at 5k for gold? If so, how many treasury notes can we store?
---
Thanks for the advice! :)
---
Is there a good spot to drop a nuke that ppl will enjoy?
---
Shoot I honestly don‚Äôt know about the GB cap. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised though. At one time I had 300 treasury notes because I didn‚Äôt know how to use them.
---
Yep. Add in the points in agility and over the 90 u go. Try it don‚Äôt take my word for it
---
stims are like my heroin, im always chasing that dragon
---
I recommend going to Morgantown High School and Morgantown Airport. I was able to finish the challenge in one match that way.
---
do you have the data to back that up, though? I don't think anyone reversed the executable to find out how sneak works, exactly.
---
I mean, is each piece a 15% bonus? and is it additive, multiplicative, or something else entirely? and if it's 15%, a full set is still only 75%.
---
"ill stash these for when i need them."
---
\*never carry them so theyre never available when i need them\*
---
\^ me.
---
for some reason the flyboy mask you get in the atom shop does
---
The double prefix has been legacy for quite awhile now patched out the same time explodo lasers were, but explosive on a harpoon was patched out not to long ago. Two shot though (if thats what your talking about) is still possible on a harpoon.
---
Here's the kicker: You need that junk to repair/craft your gear. So it's not "mostly worthless" It's vital to the game. Especially flux like OP is talking about, since it's hard to come by and used for almost every endgame recipe.
---
It's endgame stuff. You're not meant to have it straight away. You're meant to work for it. Many many games do this.
---
All the server crashes are host side. It has nothing to do with your system. A SSD upgrade just loads and renders the game faster with higher frame rate consistency
---
Crashing this patch is insane. Back to where it was pre-wastelanders. I crash at least 1-3 per play session.
---
I know on a character that has learned most of the generator plans you can buy those from vendors (White Springs for example).  I have not seen a windmill plan at a vendor, anywhere.  I know I have bought large and Fusion at vendors to trade to my other characters to learn.
---
They've released other variants, but I don't recall the original stainless variant ever once being available after its initial addition. Please give me examples of weeks that it returned to the atomic shop. As for your accusation of me trying to "stir shit," I have no idea where that came from. The people that made a stink about it have long since moved on, but after all the controversies Bethesda has endured with this game, I expect them to be paranoid when it comes to bringing back anything that originally caused one.
---
Edit: researching myself, it seems like they brought the original stainless steel variant back one time in January at a 50% discount, but I believe that's the only time. Again, I'm not trying to start an argument or stir up controversy, I just genuinely want a chance to buy it for my own camp and because I incorrectly assumed it had never returned to the store I wasn't optimistic that I would ever have the opportunity. Still, only returning once six months ago barely improves my expectations.
---
Oh cool
---
Yeah, I always skip this one. It's too time consuming. My free time is rare :(
---
this is going to sound like a jerk answer when i don't mean it to, but they won't exist because they already don't exist. being so close to the bombs they've said a few times it gave them a chance to make up some new creatures that wouldn't have survived long enough to get to the main fallout story time. but here's hoping they can find a way to roll them into the mainline continuity so they can pop up in future games as well :)
---
I guess my only counterargument would be that we have outfits in fallout, not that I'm even particularly arguing against a transmog system. I think the biggest difference, is with WoW, armor is 100% of your characters aesthetic, and ESO, you have so many variations in armor, with all motifs, and then outfits on top of it.
---
I would really love to see a dye system with in fallout 76, being able to change up our outfit colors would really add to our characters flair imo.
---
Me. 250 each in vendor GT: rammadeus
---
Camp is near top of the world. If you need an invite let me know. In case you didn't know you cannot have carnivore and herbivore at the same time.
---
Ok. Nope I‚Äôm not a nerd. But I can confirm as I‚Äôve said 5 pieces of Uny HTD taking off the 3 points in sneak from the agility tree doesn‚Äôt affect my sneak which is to the point I can walk up to and pet mutant hounds without being out of caution. As I‚Äôve said. Try it
---
Hopefully I'll get a speedy response.
---

---
They don't weigh anything so you can store an infinite amount. Also I have all of the camp related buillon plans, the Turbo Fertilizer makes grenades which you can throw at player crops and they grow back instantly. Would almost skip the well unless you like it for the aesthetics but I like everything else
---
‚ÄúOho, your approaching me‚Äù
---
Honestly all they had to do was make food last a little longer and make food water loss much slower. Hell even make food water satiate more of the Food Water Meter for good measure. That would fix 95% of peoples complaints.
---
This reminds me of the time I happened upon a camp where the guy did this. I happened to see it right before entering so I threw on my high radiation gear, popped a rad X, and favorited my Rad Away and went to town. Dude had a couple hundred of each stable flux for 1 cap/0 caps a piece and I cleaned out 3 of his machines before he dropped server.
---
Boy was he mad and stupidly sent me some nasty messages via chat which got him banned too. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
First parts valid but Dont diss man for his language not everyone speaks English and comments like these really put non english speakers down id like to see you speak in his native tongue
---
I hit lvl 400 and rank 70 on the pass but I‚Äôm feeling a little burned out, props to you for actually completing it already lol.
---
It's honestly an easy fix, the laser rifle is a critically underpowered weapon. And just needs some damage buffs and a big durability increase. They did this with heavy weapons a while ago. They all used to be really bad besides the M2 and would do tickle damage while breaking in a single "magazine." And just add a "0" at the end of all explosive weapons durability.
---
A better fix imo would be to just remove the splitter barrels, and balance the Laser Rifle after that. Since the way they function of adding more projectiles without a damage reduction is what causes things like the explosive Gatling plasma to melt every enemy in the game. And the ballistic weapons with glitched barrel splitters can kill things like the Sheepsquatch Imposter in less than a second. That way people can keep their explosive gatling plasmas but can't abuse the splitter causing it's damage to skyrocket and ruin events for everyone else.
---
if you decide to buy levels wait until the end! 
---
Since levels increase in score needed, you get more value buy buying the last harder levels instead of spending the same amount of atoms for the same amount of easier to finish levels early on.
---
Looks, incredible agreed.
---
See solution above that is already present and used by most - deposit your junk before going off somewhere you're likely to die. And no, you  don't need MOST of the junk to repair. Besides, there is tons of flux in the world. Same cant be said for ballistic fiber. 1 nuke can get you enough flux to last weeks, it resets fast while 1 round of ballistic fiber spawn grind will get you enough to repair 2 pieces at best and doesn't reset for 20 hours no matter the amount of server hopping you're doing.
---
Come to Xbox where that‚Äôs always a full events group and no other groupsüôÉ
---
I want **less** MMO bullshit in my Fallout, not more. The level gated gear is as fucking infuriating now as it was a couple years ago, I'm constantly having to turn off the utter deluge of dailies that keep spamming my quest log, everything except black powder weaponry feels like airsoft...blah. If I wasnt running with a buddy I wouldnt have reinstalled.
---
Very strong nay for transmog.
---
Also, look into clothing. I hqve a civil war suit and top hat on my toon and you cant see any of the practical armor I have equipped.
---
Hello, unfortunately I'm not a 100% sure as to what the glitch was because when I noticed the lever action was gone, it was already the next day so I assumed it was the npc weapon losing glitch I heard about because I tend to do radiation rumble when there are people. However, a few days later I had a challenge where I had to acquire a bunch of resources for atoms so I decided to bulk then scrap them to save time. Since I had an excess of material, I decided to sell it to the freestates robot inside the whitesprings. Well fun fact, apparently if you sell your junk too fast, something in your inventory can randomly be selected and sold despite me being in the junk category cause I ended up selling my unyeilding action refresh chest piece (luckly, I noticed and bought it back) So I'm think that that could have cost me my plasma gatling. 
---
As for how I acquired them in the first place, the gatling was from year 1, a friend that's no longer playing, got his legit before it became a legacy and when he decided to quit he gave away his stuff to his friends, I was the one who got the gatling because I was his steel guy. As for the lever action, I got it in year 1 but I think I got it in a trade, honestly can't recall.
---
As for that last bit where you accuse me of doing stuff, while I don't appreciate it, I can honestly see it happening if a person was an entitled dipstick. However, just try to keep in mind that there really isn't a clear way to tell if something is duped or not unless the individual is carrying 30x of the same weapon, it's not like it's colored in hot neon pink or anything and in all likelihood I would dare say the roughly 90% of 76 players are using duped stuff whether they are aware of it or not.
---
There is another paint set that says (no voice) or something like that for the liberty prime power armor so it stops being annoying, should be there in the menu where you go to originally apply the skin
---
At what point did I say I wanted it straight away? I'm fine grinding for what I want, but don't insult me with senseless timegating.
---
Ah great, I threw one and didn‚Äôt get what it did haha will try it out tonight when I‚Äôm on. Thanks
---
White springs
---
And it always mont from the false side. In the atom shop you can see, it is mont at the front, not from the inside
---
Add me @ ItsF_ckingCake you can revive me whenever lol
---
Perfect
---
White run is a popular drop point, or theres a map online with possible spawns for the wendigo colossus, you could try those.
---
&gt;whilst I have nothing really against people who do it
---
Shame the schooling system went to shit though.
---
Very true, good point
---
k
---
In case you didn't know you can't stack carnivore and herbivore if that was your intention.
---
I dunno the exact prefix since my game is in another language, but my harpoon shoots an extra bullet by the cost of one, and is also explosive, and with that"shotgun" mod the thing basically one shots most mobs in the game but the bad part is you have to reload after each shot, but considering the legendary stats, is it legacy?
---
Oh and btw. I run full Uny sent atm with 3x sneak and 15 points in agility. That gives me max sneak as well so by that logic HTD doesn‚Äôt even stack once. It‚Äôs build dependant. Chameleon stacks as well but as sneak caps at 90%, just like everything else, and agility in most builds being at least 10 points 5 with a couple bits of HTD puts u over the cap anyways.
---
All you have to do is launch a nuke to finish the main questline, it doesn't matter where. Nuking FSP just triggers the event where she comes out. It's honestly nothing special, just a bullet sponge that never lands who has the power of game crashes on her side
---
It‚Äôs not the friendly thing to do obviously. But honestly, I‚Äôm kind of tired of the whole ‚Äúfriendly wasteland‚Äù stuff. God forbid someone wanna be a wasteland menace or roleplay as a raider without being condemned by the entire community.

I don‚Äôt do anything to exploit the game or break the rules. I look for people in workshops and simply pick fights with whoever I come across if I‚Äôm in the mood. The original post was sarcasm. I don‚Äôt really think we should get XP for PvP. And normally I don‚Äôt take all the junk of people I kill. Especially low levels. Unless I‚Äôm in particular need of a certain item. 
---
Most low levels are better sports about stuff like that anyway. A lot of the remaining high level players only wanna sit around and decorate their camp. Since Bethesda pushed away everyone else with their abandonment of PvP and lack of satisfying gameplay content. But of course people that like cosmetics stuck around, because of this amazing season pass (sarcasm again).
---
Another tip if you have too much junk: Stop collecting it or move your camp.
---
If it was a trade set up in a player community like the one found on reddit with active mods, you can report them and they'll be blacklisted. Only deal with trade groups who have a karma system imo. Makes it safer, also better if they have couriers
---
Does armor, bird bones, and goat legs stack? I should be at 100% between the 3 but I still take a small amount of fall damage.
---
Idk if they've patched it but there was a glitch where you drink nukashine and ride mr. Fuzzy until it teleports you. This causes the song to constantly play on end regardless of where you are.
---
Definitely the stuff of nightmares
---
That is what came to my mind.  Literally, the DLC and missions that started it all last spring and it is the only head you must buy???
---
Not really proud of it yeah but about 10 times as much as OP üòÇ
---
Just hover your cursor over it and a repair option will show up. Or go into build mode and do the same.
---
You wait till it's broke. 
---
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it." - A Vault Tec poster somewhere
---
Try to not do the dailies once in a while. Bethesda basically wants to FOMO us in to doing dailies / logging in everyday. IMO if you aren't having fun and are just "playing" the game to get rewards that won't matter after you get them, its time to play another game.
---
Try some other games out and skip the dailies. The feeling is liberating when you see how little the rewards matter, and that there are so many games with great quest content.
---
I don't think you can repair it until it actually breaks.
---
And the flesh of dead enemies makes for a nice side dish.
---
Without going into workshop mode, go to the structure and look at it. It should give you the option to repair when you hover your mouse cursor on it.
---
The new legendary perks may help here. There‚Äôs one that adds rad resist and rad removal combined. I‚Äôm probably going to pick that one up.
---
Always stash your flux as quickly as possible when scorched earth is over.
---
That said, if you die before you do so, your pure flux goes into void, another player won't be able to retrieve it from your deathbag. People used to try to farm others after the fight was over, so bethesda made this change to de-incentivise this behavior.
---
Unfortunate that people still won't revive someone, unless they're out of stims. That also happens from time to time.
---
Would that damage my structures any? Like would the wall totally just cease to exist? Or would it exist in a damaged state merely?
---
That's a bug, and is only supposed to happen when you're in an event
---
Wait, what ammo machine are you talking about?
---
Alternatively, how about:
---
NW: Don't play NW (0/1)
---
I'll add Gauss Rifles to the list and argue its even worse as all other Gauss weapons now have a skin but not the rifle...because reasons i guess?
---
Lowest level gatling gun is level 20. There is a cultist with a guaranteed gatling gun drop in Lucky Hole mine.
---
Because it was free on Gamepass...Seriously tho, Fallout is one of my all time favorite franchises.  I fell in love with 3 and NV.  And when 4 came out I lost my shit!  I am a huge HUGE fan of creativity so being able to build my base how I want was the major draw.  But I never would have tried 76 if it had not dropped on Gamepass tbh.  But I am glad the Bethesda has worked hard to fix the broken parts of the game and I am glad I gave it a shot.  The building is fun (aside from the extremely uneven terrain) and the community is amazing as well.
---
Thanks I‚Äôve done it now finally üò¨
---
Yes I have learned this now.  Thank you!
---
It's not impossible. I get her with a pipe bolt on one of my characters every time. Just have to avoid magic gun toters and you'll get your damage in. 1000 dmg over 5 mins is 200/min. That's nothing, but some characters dont go junkies or bloodied and haven't gotten an AA gun to compensate for the queens resistances, those guys wont pass.
---
oh I didn‚Äôt know, thanks for telling me.
---
Also, if you aren‚Äôt sneaky, maybe try that. I may be crazy but I swear when my bloodied melee dude is going at her, as long as I‚Äôm in ‚Äúcaution‚Äù her melee attacks won‚Äôt hit me.
---
To be fair I found a bloodied fat man at one point and the listed damage was like 3200 which tied to a large Aoe is actually quite credible on paper, but in practice it only seems to do that damage if the nuke impacts a monster, the splash damage is quite heavily reduced and besides it's nothing that a few 5.56 rounds wouldn't solve or a Tesla rifle or something.
---
The weapon worked well in the other games where there was a clear and present threat because people didn't have full legendary equipment that trivialises monsters into glorified EXP and loot pinatas.
---
I *have* tried it. I mentioned this in a different thread just now, but I've been playing sneak since release and tried several different setups.
---
bottom line is that I have 35+ agility and all the relevant sneak perks, mutations and legendaries and can hardly keep caution.
---
and yes, I have tried that specific setup. 5 uny/snk pieces. if I remove the sneak perk I'm instantly detected. personally I've had more success replacing one uny piece with cha than stacking HTD, which doesn't seem to affect my ability to sneak at all. as per turtle's video.
---
my guess is that lag massively affects one's ability to sneak. which the reason for your experience being so different than mine.
---
also anecdotal evidence is trash. you can't just say "trust me bro" without the data to back it up. and I don't think anyone, not even in the dataminer discord, bothered reversing the executable.
---
While it would not affect me either way, I play in the evening instead of watching TV, still I support this idea. I've had enough weird work schedules in the past to understand your problem.
---
il should be at your base in a few minutes
---
Just got another update regarding my case:  Hello! We can confirm that the reply you sent today has been received and is in the correct queue for manual review. When an update is available an agent will be able to reach out. Thanks for your patience as our volume has been higher than usual.
---
"give me an option to have no penalty for dying!!"
---
Short answer is no
---
I don't last long enough to find creatures. Lol. Ugh.
---
i shall look up how i acquire such armor
---
Whatever Karen lol
---
I did the same thing. I asked for atoms again, but I doubt anything will happen
---
no bother. I might be showing offline even though i am set to show online.
---
Stop right there criminal scum
---
I will grab a screenshot tonight and post it. Sorry missed your reply.
---
Thanks hopefully I'll get one soon too, otherwise I'm busy playing NV. Oh how I've missed this game..
---
I think "PVP is dead" in that you can't join a random public server and find PVP opponents.  There's no survival mode...and most people who claim workshops are just trying to complete their SCORE tasks, so it's doubtful they'll try to defend them.  I'm sure there's still people who enjoy PVP, but I think you need to seek them out on Discord or something and add them as friends in game.
---
Well... That kind of heavy too. Food is so abundant, you don't really need to carry it with you.
---
I said ‚Äúalmost impossible‚Äù, it‚Äôs just a lot harder. If you have a heavy weapon you won‚Äôt have to worry about not doing enough damage in time.
---
Wasteland storyline, can‚Äôt remember which faction it was from (do both missions up till the point of choosing) but If you‚Äôve already done that then you can buy it from which one sells it.
---
I had been doing this with my gauss pistol and it waa working for the most part,  untill mid last week when despite 95% hit chance i would miss 4-5 times regardless.   Not sire if the pistol is simply more bugged than the rifles, but it seems to have no effect on mt plasma pistol for example.  Please please fix this
---
he got u bro, he got u for the mothman
---
Better yet, undo everything they've done to pvp since launch and just make passive work correctly
---
Lets not add more things for them to screw up
---
Man... You reeeeaaally want a friendly wasteland. People like you are the reason we don't have Survival mode anymore.
---
I never said trust me bro. I‚Äôm not 13. And I can go-on experience of actually running  Uny sneak with the sneak cards removed over almost 80 levels and being entirely invisible the whole time. If I changed a couple of pieces to Uny sent, which I did as my armour got upgraded I became far less able to stay in caution and was detected more. That‚Äôs not lag. That‚Äôs not passed on stories. That‚Äôs me over many levels experiencing it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong 30+ agility helps a tonne but with 3 HTD and 2 sent I had to reequip the sneak cards to maintain my stealthyness
---
I feel you.
---
Just an FYI to OP and others: it's pretty much impossible to not know when Meat Week is actively happening. It will be featured on the login screen, it happens hourly so you will receive in-game event notices, and as with everything that goes on with this game, there will be a ton of posts about it. 
---
Basically, the only way to miss out on knowing when Meat Week is currently happening is to not play the game or come to this sub.
---
Can't wait to test this myself......next year at this rate. (haven't even gotten half way.)
---
Just curious... was it flatwoods or morgantown?
---
You‚Äôre welcome. You can buy both if you want but do a little research on food buffs to determine which one you want. It‚Äôs easier to research them and then consume one versus consuming one and trying it out because you have to cure yourself of it before you can take the other one. If you have several mutations it can be a headache to cure one specific one.
---
Noob here but dont you need Spoiled food for grenades?
---
Also, because I've tested this for science, in my experience, the flux you get from scorched earth can only be retrieved from your bag if you've logged out, than back in. Que the idiot who logged in, afked in front of V9, and came back to his console with a dead character. /facepalm
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a grind
---
Now I feel like a bad person for building a 2 door mantrap in mine with a crafting bench to lure them in and get them to not pay attention.
---
ok, maybe not too bad.
---
Don't worry, it'll be recycled back into the Atom Shop again.
---
Right outside of Flatwoods, past the Ag center
---
Yeah that happened to me last week with the daily and weekly challenges
---
Settlers faction.
---
I did both :D T65 for my junkies tank, and SS uny for my rifleman. It's around a month farm.
---
Any events in the forest....make sure you either join an events group or a builder group to max XP.
---
ive started the one for the settlers but i still have seemingly long way to go lol
---
It's ridiculous. It would be nice to have a few minutes of non pvp to get your challenges done. About 90% of the time I don't even have a weapon yet when someone tosses a grenade at me.
---
&gt;To start, this is entirely my doing so I‚Äôm not complaining. 
---
That's just not true. Bethesda employs a bunch of psychological tricks to keep people hooked &amp; playing.
---
I'm not just singling out Bethesda. A lot of other devs do this too. More making the point that it's not entirely your doing.
---
I've only been playing NW since Season 1 started, but I can't remember a match where I didn't see at least one creature. I have no idea how so many people are struggling with this challenge.
---
If you have the morgantown map then you go to the morgantown highschool there are always mongrels
---
Aside from what the other said, you also can't really cheese a silo Any more without map breaking. People used to be able to exit their PA through laser grids which cut 90% of the process, you get an error that there's not enough room to exit when you try that now.
---
Pretty much this. If OP wants to PvP and is on PC, I‚Äôd be down for that. I‚Äôm in no way built for it, but it‚Äôd be a nice change of pace from going through the Burrow‚Äôs for the tenth time in a day.
---
Have you bought the under armor? Think it‚Äôs bis though I could be wrong.
---
Pookie0317

---
They‚Äôre trying to keep the game rolling along until the next big DLC. So we get faction grinds, new time gated shopping items, a battle pass type season, events like Fasnacht and Meat Week, and anything else requiring low development effort. Keep people playing or risk them losing interest when BoS content drops. At the core of it all, players can consume content faster than it can be generated, and this game in particular seems like it is struggling to keep up with content demand.
---
That's a very shitty system to me, I can only wait until my house is ruined to be able to fix it? God damn it Bethesda. I was thinking "Totally I am not expected to build mansions when it can all come tumbling down without the ability to prevent that right?" but no it seems I am :/
---
I'm down to join ya. in game name is Naldan78.
---
This door visualization bug has been a problem for a long time. I've seen other players pass though a door that's closed for me, but open for them, but when I try to open it, the closing animation plays, and I have to open it again before I can pass though. Always annoying when it happens.
---
If you don't mind I am around 195 and willing to help. I have seen many of my friends drop off but still kept playing all the time from beta. I am a casual player who had others but saw as each dropped off.  I will be on vacation for two weeks soon but when I get back I would be happy to group up and help you along with any others we find along the way.
---
Would be cool if you could buy a apartment there, different locations in some of those building's.
---
He thought he had a right to be mad at you?
---
Have you sided with them yet? If not, wait till you get to that point then do the raiders one up till that point too. And someone has just mentioned that it‚Äôs the settlers you get the stealth suit with.
---
hit up Morgantown Airport.
---
Oh, how the mighty have fallen. You downvoted me so I just wanted to prove that your downvote came with you ignorance and arrogance. You didn‚Äôt know what you were talking about even though I was actually supporting your original comment. Now you just look dumb..
---
Way to try to save face, chump.
---
No kidding...It's nice just to get killed because I suck, not because of hackers.
---
But it's winter. What's in my update then?
---
Damn man that‚Äôs bad. Yeah it‚Äôs still working for me on the gauss rifle. I wish Bethesda could fix these bugs man. Stop content for a few months and just focus on bug fixing.
---
Probably could have just piggybacked this on another post about it.
---
Me but I've kicked the habit. The module grind was so awful I decided not to engage with it anymore. Cancelled 1st, I'll check back in once the colossus event drops.
---
I'm pretty sure things repair themselves after your session, but yeah, you essentially wait for it to break
---
I got drunk with my friends Friday night and slept in most of Saturday. Those stackable lunch boxes are way too good.
---
Lol. Different strokes and what not. I'm lvl 170ish and if I lost my junk to a death trap I'd probably just go on living my life. If it's a low level though I'd feel bad for them.
---
Has anyone tried to destroy your camp in retaliation?
---
I've had the mr fuzzy thing happen to me as and it was a nightmare -- the music does not stop playing. 
---
Happens also when interacting with a workbench bench as well, was modifying a piece of armor when then guy left and I was stuck in the armor workbench animation. It's terrible because you can't shoot or interact with anything but still hilarious.
---
IV sent you a friend's request let me know if it's not there and I will try again
---
oof that sounds like a lot of effort just for some pvp.  i dont want to be the asshole running around hitting people multiple times harassing them, but if i just hit randoms one time wont there be any action? or is everyone pacifist?
---
Text chat is required if you truly want what you want &amp; Bethesda made it very clear they don't have any intention of doing it for the foreseeable future.
---
That's cool what's your IGN and I will add you?
---
And one day those 20 atoms will be mine.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve got that too.
---
I know. Had a friend grinding from the beginning about to hit 100 today. You must've been hopping servers non stop.
---
Woot!  Just reached half way mark at level 50!!!  No purchases yet!
---
I love how excited you seem about this.
---
Nothing. :)
---
i wonder if players are indeed hitting the benchmarks they expected when they plotted this out.  i cannot speak for whether thats a good thing or bad thing, but i am curious how they crunched the #s to see if its making economic sense
---
Mr. Fuzzy mining helmets can also be bought at the company store at Camden Park for 20 tokens
---
Truth spoken here....."I'm back, got someone you need dead? Yes? Excellent!"
---
Spawned there 3 times. Only had mongrels 1 time :(
---
Ah I see thats strange
---
He spawns at my camp location pretty commonly.  He's not much of a threat
---
Explosives as quest rewards. Why are some plans super hard to find, looking at you Shielded Casual, while others of the same quality are not?
---
Why does the random hits bug still exist?
---
Why are players allowed to kill my cow?
---
Why does Bethesda says bugs are fixed when they certainly are NOT!?
---
Yes please
---
Where did he say they were trading? All he said was someone took their gun
---
Edit: you are correct, it just doesn't sound as though it was a trade.  I've had people offer to mod my weapon, with me giving them a cold, hard "no", expecting them to steal it
---
Edit 2: OP stated elsewhere it was an organised trade.  You are 100%, disregard my previous drivel lol
---
Pretty much. Was just saying this. They keep adding new shit to atom shop and yet where are the legendary perks and new content??
---
Yeah. It's funny that this is the second bug associated with that door that was just released that way.
---
It's as if Bethesda doesn't have a QA department &amp; they're perfectly happy knowingly releasing something buggy.
---
Good
---
Shadowed has been fixed and works now with other armors aswell. But it is still not worth it if you are using unyielding armor. You don't even need sneak perk because of the high agility we have. I have base agility of 11 and full uny set making my agility around 30 with all other effects and such. And i have not used sneak perk in months. Just as good at sneaking as with it.
---
Angry Turtle has a newer video on the shadowed mod. It seems it now works on armors other than leather, but shrouded wood armor is still bugged.
---
spending my playtime doing C.H.O.R.E.S.
---
I‚Äôve experienced for the first time today. Really odd bug
---
then how do you explain me not being able to replicate that with a full HTD setup? for almost 500 levels, as if that's a metric to go by? also, where's the data to back that up? how can you boast that 3 HTD pieces = level 3 sneak?
---
that would mean each HTD piece equals a 25% improvement in sneak, or a single sneak perk card level. so by your logic, you'd have the same results with just level 1 sneak and 2 HTD pieces? is that it? and how do you know that each piece is additive anyway?
---
in regards to your other post, agility, sneak, and chameleon are all different parts of the sneak mechanic. although I \*think\* HTD is the same as sneak (as in the perk). these max out individually, and having maxed invisibility, for example, does not mean you have maxed sneak.
---
like the CSS. it maxes out invisibility, but it doesn't help with equipment weight. so you're still making noise. you need escape artist for that, and even then muffled does something entirely different. there's more than one "armor noise" class.
---
All events are good just make shaw that‚Äôs ppl are there don‚Äôt try to kill jest tag enemies and help out where ever you can
---
You also give all substations in that area free power. 
---
The food factory workshop has one of these power boxes too, connected to the food machine--they give 10 power always or 100 if the power plant is running
---
+karma
---
2 heavy studded leather limbs, 2 polished heavy metal limbs, and a heavy BOS combat chest. Best balance of everything. In my opinion, only SS armor beats it.
---
and how about "be killed by a player"
---
It's weird some days no bugs, vats working pretty well , and no crashing.  Other days server crashes, vats just plain don't work, etc....
---
ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
---
That‚Äôs contradicting. It got ziltch but downplay two instanced interiors that you enjoyed. People like the game now bud. Nobody‚Äôs making profit off hate videos anymore so they bring the hate here lmao some of these people who‚Äôre running their mouth sound like they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. We all notice
---
Absolutely he did. According to his rationale, I played unfairly and cheated him out of his flux.
---
Lol Yeah üòÇ im on xb tho
---
Get the stealth armor, radiation and damage resistance whereas the hazmat has none. Just do the settler quest line up to and complete invisible ties. You won't have to commit to them.
---
I only keep about 100 of each junk but when it comes to steel and wood, i keep like maybe 20 since you can just walk down helvetia and get steel from the baddies, wood from behind that restaurant and plastic to bulk sell the excess.
---
This would save me some perk points with sneak then...
---
If they gave us Dragon Legendaries back....
---
What were the circumstances?
---
Edit: nevermind, you've answered elsewhere
---
Maybe a little. It's super-duper cute...and I want one for my home office.
---
Yup :) I just swapped my sneak for thru-hiker for more carry weight. Give it a go. You'll notice quite fast you don't need it.
---
Man, that's totally what I'm best at, too! I'd have the challenge locked!
---
solid list! Really sorry to hear about your Pioneer scout glitching :/
---
I didn't even realize those coins had weight. Time to cash in. I'd rather the 10 carry weight then the jackpot haul anyway.
---
Power armor or hazmat suit and a ton of Radaway. Once you progress enough with the settlers, you'll get some Chinese stealth armor that I prefer to use now in radiation.
---
Yeah, you can always try...although I'm not sure how much success you'll have.  It may be better to get a mic so others know you're just playing for fun and not being a "griefer"
---
Am I the only one who wouldn't exactly be super disappointed to be erroneously banned? To be **forced** to go back to playing games where you never have to deal with a single bug, and in the extremely rare event that you do - it is *promptly fixed in the very next patch... that would be a bit of a gift at this point, tbh üòî 
---
But I can't bring myself to leave of my own accord. I'm perpetually clinging to false hope for the "next patch" to fix more than it breaks.  
---
And then I'm let down. Every. Single. Time.
---
I didn't get it
---
You can usually find it in the Big Bend Tunnel where Radiation Rumble spawns. There's usually a suit in one of the side rooms, IIRC.
---
Super Mutants are good for XP. Should be able to find low level Mutants in the dry lake bed below the Lakeside Cabins. Also check the airport area around the Wade Airport. Besides that I would highly recommend using the new public teams feature.
---
I'm curious, what type of stairs were you using? The vanilla or atomic shop?
---
You might as well just start buying the rest of the plans. Just make a prioritized list of remaining items based on what you think you should buy next. Start at the top of the list and work your way down. Realistically, it‚Äôs just a matter of time before you‚Äôve purchased all of the plans that available for gold bullion.
---
Aw :(
---
500 for the prefab last week was great. 
---
 500 for a stove? hell no
---
And the skins that already exist in the files and just haven't been released yet. I skipped the Screaming Eagle because I'd rather wait for the wood furniture variant or, even better, the R91 skin, but who knows when those will actually get released.
---
Lmao theres a 95 behemoth near Solomon's Pond, good luck
---
Psa use rad x to suppress herb for meatweek benefits and rad x deluded to "un"suppress :). Rad x dont stack so you can have best of both worlds.
---
I got a good laugh from this one today.
---
If you are really dedicated
---
And then everyone clapped, and the president of America invited you to Raven Rock for coffee!
---
the RR garage door is on the walls tab
---
https://i.gyazo.com/6ef97b983ceb15c23fdc7b03a879bf24.jpg
---
LOL....are you guys new? It's been like this for almost 2 years
---
Yeah, tried following the guide.  No dice.  The items aren't in the location at all.
---
Figure I'm done with the game for a bit
---
I looked into that cause I ran into a guy who was using 2 accounts at the same time and apparently, if you make another account (at least on ps4 as far as I know) and unlink your first account, you get a warning that states the unlinked account will be lost. Personally, I'll wait it out to see if there is hope at the end of this tunnel.
---
That, plus people going out of their way to do high xp events, and using all xp buffs available.  Won't take long to shoot up the levels
---
The door is under "walls" in the build menu.
---
thank you!
---
Keep in mind too it tends to bug out as well (will look closed even though it's open)
---
&gt;Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to edit/grant S.C.O.R.E. 
---
That might be true but it's a lie that Bethesda can't since they're the dev. They just choose not to prioritise this because you're not worth the effort to make this tool or to adjust it manually.
---
Keep pushing support. Bethesda said that they couldn't restore lost items or wiped characters (still to this day) &amp; yet have demonstrated they can multiple time.
---
If you're 1st sub or recurring paying customer buying Atoms, make it clear that you no longer will &amp; will encourage others to do the same until this is resolved. Loss of revenue is the only thing Bethesda responds to.
---
When the queen is dead,  go to one of the 3-4 tents that are always there and use the stash box.
---
400 hrs.  Level 239. Double xp def helped
---
I got a message from dude. All it said was ‚ÄúBruh‚Äù
---
No prob
---
 I lovedcthe idea of eating whatever but im indecisive. Theres also a perk card in end called cannibal does same as mutation. I swear by herb.
---
If people are on tents/fences/roofs the SBQ won‚Äôt land frequently, if she‚Äôs staggered she won‚Äôt land either
---
So all of the challenges are repeatable or what?
---
Same thing happened to me.  Makes me not want to play
---
Just part of life in the wasteland
---
Yeah, I know. Sometimes you die, or get downed before you get there. People either just watch you bleed out, and take your stuff and stash it.
---
It‚Äôs 100 degrees where I am, and I don‚Äôt even live in the South. Nothing to enjoy about summer lol.
---
As soon as the SBQ hits the ground and you've looted her, either run for a survival tent that's bound to be placed nearby and use their stash box to store your junk right away or make a beeline for Watoga Station. Otherwise this will happen. The mobs don't stop just because the boss falls. Consider it an expensive and frustrating lesson. It has happened to all of us.
---
Wait ...Raven Rock the bunker or Raven Rock in Solstheim?
---
LMAO
---
Get the plasma caster I just got a great bloodied one. But get the true long barrel and prime capacitor. DO NOT get the pulse capacitor it is a waste of gold.
---
As I say, just one and I'd be happy lol
---
They have been occationaly doing that since wastelanders hit. Most likely a bug.
---
How do I know if I'm on pace to catch that green bastard?
---
106 rn, and it's only gonna get hotter.
---
I was trying to fight 2 normal scorchbeasts neaf the glassed cavern too and they just wouldn't land. I was just cautioned on the floor waiting in the open and they didn't land so I gave up
---
Yeah, hence my suggestion. You‚Äôre stealing from another player, it should have some sort of ramification.
---
Sorry for the silly question, but how do I install the batch file? I don't see OneDrive on my files and I'm signed into a Windows account, not a user account on my PC. I have zero experience working with batch files as you can tell lol.
---
Non-mutated human enemies have dropped lootbags since day one of Wastelanders.
---
That makes no sense! Thank you so much, though, because I was wondering, too! I didn't even think to look in walls for a darn door!
---
So are bounties. They should utilize them. Idc if people take my stuff, I just want the opportunity to take it back.
---
Okay, ill try it out. Thanks for replying!
---
We have the same buildüßçüèª
---
 Neither of them should be doing what I just described.
---
Yup same. Im not grinding XP again to catch back up
---
I understand the sentiment. It's frustrating to have a company ignore obvious flaws and bugs but expect the player base to support them financially. I always knew bugs would be a problem with this game since they announced it and said there would be no modding and no true private servers. Bethesda, for all the good shit they make just, can't make a stable product. They just got lucky and stumbled on a playstyle people enjoy.
---
Personally I'd go without new content for 3-6 months if they did weekly bug fixes for that time and got the game in a better place.
---
Yeah, exactly lol
---
Tbh, i'm seeing that in very rare occasion. The vast majority of the time people at least try to get to me when i'm downed. I'm on ps4 though. Maybe it's different on other platforms.
---
I have noticed they run normally on my private server but i have no way of playing them solo, on normal servers they take forever and then no one joins them. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the servers winding down and limiting such interactive events or the demands of so many players that slow it down but I do often feel like 76 is withholding events.
---
Yes there‚Äôs a 3 hour personal cooldown per character in each silo, server doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Wish they‚Äôd tell you that at the elevator door instead of the launch placement at the very end, been burned like that too.
---
I'm hoping they bring the atom challenges back for those couple of weeks, but that's just wishful thinking.
---
what level are you?
---
Oops.....I must need more coffee.
---
Got a long way to go in NW before I get to 40. 
---
15, OTOH, is doable.
---
thx for de-confusing me :)
---
...Or would staggeringly favor people with the money to throw at buying atoms or an excess of time to grind XP, which would create a *ton* of outrage in the fanbase.
---
NW: View the Main Menu (0/1)
---
I have a bloodied limb damage dcg but now we can't cripple the queen either to keep her down more so it's even worse. The only useful thing is the cryolator but u can't duel wield
---
Vanilla stairs can be removed if it's not connected to anything. The steel grated stairs cannot be removed at all once you place it down. In order to remove it you have to replace it with the vanilla staircase and then you can remove it. The vault tec stair cause works like vanilla staircase and so does the Nuka cola stair case.
---
Log out before noon log back in after
---
Yeah. I was unaware it was tied to character and not server. Ah thats frustrating.
---
Can confirm. Bloodied melee with no sneak perk can easily stand on mutants toes no issues.
---
It counts down and then explodes, damaging anybody in the blast radius. As a bonus, you don't get wanted for killing someone with it.
---
Omfg i also use a dcg
---
Yeah I think Battlefield 4 had something like this, you could use a +50% XP bonus that would last for one hour, but that hour was gameplay dependent, it wouldn't run down sitting in the menu lol
---
Yeah - and wouldn't that be better than any content they could possibly add, too!
---
It seems they are completely incapable without the aid of a FO76 equivalent of the [Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598/) and I honestly don't think that will ever change. Fixing bugs is less profitable than selling us the retail therapy to deal with the frustration they cause.
---
Let me ask you this then. Why play a game that was planned from the start as a Fallout MMO?
---
I appreciate your empathy lol
---
It's only speculation but I've noticed that whenever I need to get an actual human to look at my tickets (usually due to technical issues mind you), I inform customer support on twitter during their open hours. If they ask for your ticket number, it seems to get bumped past the automatic response wall.
---
Different to make the distinction between atom shop and earned via Score, perhaps?
---
Given the hunter bundle includes the mounted SSQ head, and they picture it \[edit: the original SS plushie\], the original might have been a nice bonus to the bundle....
---
Cheers, I‚Äôve not got that but will get it. Thanks.
---
Exactly üëçüèª
---
PvP is basically dead.   U got NW or u can just hang out in adventure workshops for PvP.  Most adventure mode pvp players are geared for PvP.
---
people report different results with sneak. personally I can barely maintain caution with level 3 sneak and 35+ agility.
---
so your mileage may vary.
---
I know the feeling. Im an unarmed build (hull health) and sometimes I just walk away from the fight because they don't land after 1 minute as i sometimes forget to bring a ranged weapon.
---
Could you try it with two mismatched pieces? I could check myself in the game data, but I'm guessing the armor conditions for those perks just check for five matching pieces of armor. Power armor has six, so even if one is mismatched you still have five to meet the conditions.
---
Np
---
A lot of F bombs where dropped that night haha
---
Yes, and this would not be all that hard since the Nuka Girl outfit already hides the backpack.
---
It would be nice if groups like Legendary hunting also increased chance for legendary spawns.
---
Perhaps casual one should reduce the food consumption per party member?
---
Builder should give bonuses to workshops and capturing them. Making workshop invasion harder perhaps with better loots?
---
I was considering using a power fist because the pucture mod comes with anti armour. Anti armour is better for high armour and high level enemies more than a damage boost
---
You are my favourite. Seriously.
---
I didnt get into the game until after noon my time
---
You mean 2am right?
---
Bruhhhh yess
---
Maybe 1 in 4, although I'm looking for more diverse double xp events, I understand people with my circumstances, we're probably in the minority lol
---
Been playing since beta.
---
Yes sorry was just quoting my time
---
I hear you.  Nothing quite like playing a game of "locate the hole in the floor/wall to progress".  Gets annoying quick.
---
My favorite is Watoga for tubes.  Get my tubes and can also do a magazine/bobble route.
---
Happened to me last week.
---
7.5k score gone bye bye
---
Nah, if you can murder another player in a workshop without getting a bounty, then why should you get an over priced bounty on your head from using a general mechanic &amp; feature of the wasteland?
---
Attack the player to get your loot back, that's what I usually do, and get a bonus for it.
---
Complete a weapons collection for instance I am working on junkie's combat shotguns so far I  I have the 25/25, E/25, Limb/25 still need the 33/25.  then I will switch to pumps with the same rolls and then double barrel same rolls.  The I will go back to playing commando :)
---
*cRy MoRe*
---
Are you in the South or Southwest? I think everywhere is getting a heat wave, boo. Good day to stay in and get those SCORE points lol
---
Or even just the one you supported in Wastelanders.
---
Good point, though I‚Äôd argue they should utilize the bounty system more. If you‚Äôre being a raider you should get punished like one
---
According to the wiki, the Institute started in 2110 which is only 8 years from the start of 76, albeit just a bunch of scientists in a basement, yet it would be neat to see some early synth tech make its way to Appalachia.
---
I agree, new factions would be awesome, but I think they're not going add any more models into this aging game engine, I mean, why make new models when you can get money selling skins and other stuff in the atom shop.
---
Right on! Just finished today myself, but I had bought about 10 levels a few days back as I had extra atoms. The challenges were fun and just the right mix of grind and play. Started around 100ish and I'm closing in on 200. What's your favorite item reward from it?
---
Yup I lost all my weekly points too.  I was on track to complete, now am well behind.  I don't think an extra 250-500 a day from the additional daily challenges is going to help
---
A lot of my playtime is because it's mindless enough to occupy my ADD during DnD night without distracting me too much from what's going on in the game.
---
Just run serendipity and let fate decide
---
I play a shotgun build and have for the last 3 months. It's what I enjoy even against SBQ when I lose out on loot sometimes.
---
The bugs I deal with daily with just my shotguns...
---
Fast travel with my Combat shotgun and then have to unequip and reequip because otherwise the faster reload speed will not be in effect.
---
Gauss Shotguns cause a bug that will not allow reloading or using of any items or changing weapons unless you holster the weapon and bring it back out again.
---
Carrying multiple shotguns that are the same type IE multiple pump action will cause a favorited one to equip the wrong version even though the favorite has not changed. You then have to manually equip the correct one.
---
I deal with this shit every fucking day and thats just a small sample of stuff. We could all list 100 things that annoy us daily.
---
This makes sense but it does seem like they have been prioritising adding or tweaking cash flow systems over actual content.
---
Congrats!
---
I think it depends what time of day you play. At least that's how it appears in my experience. 9ish pm onwards seem to be rare. But if I get on in the afternoon they seem to be more frequent.
---
That's probably nonsense, but definitely feels like it.
---
I'm considering adding Herd Mentality to my vast array of mutations, but I'm afraid this is one of those things that would get patched out later and then I'd have to spend a ton of caps getting my DNA properly fucked again, as I do still enjoy the occasional solo jaunt. :(
---
I believe I can achieve that one lol üòÇ
---
Monongah power plant spawns a bunch of bloat flies and mutant hounds. Only problem is it was a pretty likely hot drop on a normal day. Today (bc I assume a lot of ppl know the creature spawn rate) it‚Äôs a REAL hot drop. Even still, managed to complete the challenge in 3 matches. First 2 I was wrecked in under five min but got a single creature kill each time. 3rd I got lucky and no one else dropped there. Was able to easily find 3 creatures to kill that round.
---
The Longshoreman outfit hides the backpack, too.
---
Also, I watched your vid. I would advise you to claim your map prizes before the map resets with the next season. You will lose anything left on the board that isn't claimed .
---
It's annoying when ppl open them on events when you already have some going...
---
The clean sweep pose üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Check me out on Instagram @appalachian_terrence
---
I have a clean sweep series of photos.
---
And congrats!
---
Yes, true.  You can buy the Power Generator plans from the robot Vendors.  
---
Never went looking for the Windmill plan so you might be right.  If true, that might be a good farm candidate.  
---
I had already learned the Medium and Large Power Generator plans on my character that I was testing with, so I'm just getting Windmill and Fusion Generator plans.  In  a recent 5x runs I got 3x Windmill and 2x Fusion Generator.  My though is that those two would be the most sought after.
---
I'm staring at one in my camp that i specifically bough because it was half off.  Stop bullshitting.
---
I was so looking forward to double dailies... now I don‚Äôt need them üò≠
---
Enjoy the grind!
---
Here i am at rank 32..... I should quit my job just to plsy this game.
---
Here is an easy one. Enter a player shop and have your mouse already over their inventory. Won't scroll unless you move the mouse off that inventory and then on it again.
---
I'm on level 35 of the run right now. Am I in a good place to finish by the time the season ends?
---
Right. Crazy how many times we have to do one event for the simplest thing lol.
---
This lol
---
Skipping it again. :)
---
Grats dude, that‚Äôs a long road. Closing in on it myself, but man the grind is real on this...
---
Yea that was the first thing I did beofre I ever tried.
---
Pipe is life ....
---
I‚Äôm actually unsure how the math stands as of right now. Make sure you do all of your dailies Thursday through Sunday. They‚Äôll be worth double SCORE.
---
You can always make a new character, and get it to level 3 to get the level up.
---
Apart from everything from the 17th to the 27th I've done all the daily and weekly challenges (apart from the NW ones)
---
The way BES won‚Äôt add a confirm trade window I feel they want players to play raiders and rob other players.   
---
Either way, who ever took ur shit is dip shit but didn‚Äôt break any game rule.
---
I deleted the door and submitted a ticket for a refund. Hopefully enough people will do the same and Bethesda will start to learn that there are consequences to putting untested and/or broken items in the Atomic Shop.
---
The thought of that one makes me so moist.
---
Where the heck do they go lol? I‚Äôve ran into mothmen twice. Both times right as I shoot they teleport into the sky never to be seen again.
---
You still definitely want Escape Artist to reduce noise from movement.
---
And that list would be [promptly ignored](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/24/56/cc24564416b7adca2abe1ac3ee33425e.gif) in favour of untested and broken Atom Store items.
---
I mostly see people wait on PC. Xbox some people are kind, others will watch you bleed out. I‚Äôve even see people try and bait Mirelurk hunters, kings, or deathclaws towards people so they get slapped. I applaud them on their intuition, but again I‚Äôd like to be able to actually fight them for my stuff back.
---
It kind of depends on what you're sneaking against, though.  For the vast majority of cases, I don't need Sneak.  But if I'm going to crouch and melee the Scorchbeast Queen, or go unseen to the Imposter Sheepsquatch, Sneak seems to make a difference even with \~30 AGI.
---
Congrats, but Not finding the grind enjoyable at all, and no incentive for me there except for the Atoms. There's nothing I would ever actually use on the board so I can give up once I hit that last Atom space and move on to playing something more enjoyable.
---
Completed the quest line first then started the event with the recall card found in the basement where he reprogrammed the assultron .
---
Since then me and my team have constantly bought the key just to hopefully get the plans.
---
I've *had to* jump on the mothman the last three times I did the event this past week because it got stuck in the air.
---
Thats what it has been for me lol.
---
Don‚Äôt give them ideas, extra space should be free
---
People play more hours.  Early game XP glitch.  
---
Taking advantage of double/triple XP weekends. 
---
XP buffs.  
---
Killing high level enemies.
---
using Mirelurk kings is a hell of a cheap shot for sure...
---
Yeah I use to see bags a lot right when doc dropped but not as much anymore
---
"Take me with you!"
---
(Fallout Heart Emoji)
---
Hell a player trader me a bloodied fixer for all tthe chems I gave her or him.
---
Was greatful for it but my pride wants the plans lol.
---
True. On those specific fights i will always put my sneak back on. And use my fixer intead of handmade (which i prefer even if it does wee bit lower dps, it's more raidery).
---
Did you count how many gold bullion there actually is in the vault? üòÅ
---
If you finish your daily's and weekly's, and grind xp( and soon workshop defending )somewhat everyday, you should only need to buy a few levels at the end of the season. You should be gaining  2-5 score levels a day if that helps.
---
ü§ôüèª
---
Angry Turtle did a video on "magic" shotguns.  Something about the bashing effect and VATS makes the shotgun crazy damage.  If you get an armor piece with blocking 15, it makes all shotguns "magic" like that.
---
Guns blazing?? Melee dude, melee. Guns blazing is just asking to be killed. Get that extra damage on creatures skill, hop from bush to bush and shadow to shadow and punch the snot out of creatures.
---
my door is open but shows as closed. when you go up to the "closed" door, i have an open door option, but then the door closes üôÉ
---
ü§î
---
Didn‚Äôt power through as I started a new character got high enough as wasn‚Äôt sure did both factions, picked a side and do the 3 dailies faithfully.  So 9 a day? Plus 1 event so 11 or 12 a day roughly.  Always buy from Smiley on Sunday morning for 300.
---
Did SS first, farm tile Gauss shotgun with mods, Gauss caster with mods, under armor and now half way through T-65.  Just plugging along and great exp doing the quests so why not.
---
Yeah you could do that‚Äî or use a cow for feet. Spoiled food can be useful for this if you‚Äôre explosive build. But some areas have bags of fert just laying around
---
I usually get about 2, but I've been on vacation since the 17th so I can't do any until the 28th
---
Oh I finished that a while back. Still no luck lol.
---
You just found a "magic" shotgun, those are really broken on vats.
---
Check angry turtle magic effects video for more info.
---
I like the cash register in the Rusty Pick.  That is my place to stash stuff.
---
new gad has a bunch of lowish level super mutants
---
Need cat topiary, fish bowl lamp, and Thanksgiving display case, then I'll be a happy boy
---
I already admitted I was wrong and that it came back once in January for 50% off. I don't know what I did to piss you off so much but I really am not looking for a fight. Hopefully they'll make it available again soon because I really want one for my own camp.
---
I would almost guarantee no. 1400 is baby numbers, as these things go.
---
I sure do appreciate you posting these, when I'm at work I sneak and look and it helps every Tuesday.
---
Smart but also I was gifted 300 awhile ago and not knowing what they were had opened them all, didn't get banned but always be wary.
---
If I understand the quest script correctly, you need to have made a deal with Daniel, killed Roper and returned to Daniel to get the reward list to trigger that can drop the recipe.
---
The dead glowing ghouls, I'll fast travel to the WS train station, wait for the nuke to land, run to the clubhouse. Knowing everything is already dead. Quit and reload, everything has now re-spawned. So I quit and reload every time I want a reset of ghouls.
---
To my knowledge, how the game bans people for duping is by checking where a large mass of items comes from. Essentially making it so that only mass items in the original duper's inventory are at risk. I have a friend who had a separate account for duping and one that would receive the duped items to take advantage of this.
---
finally bethesda listens to the community!
---
Were do you think they came from then
---
Magic shotgun, in vats each pellet does full damage. I think it's getting patched next update
---
I appreciate it a lot! Thanks mate.
---
Yes I had to search forever to find both doors for it and now last night everytime I went to it it would say it was closed so I click on it and it was opened it was annoying
---
You are just confirming  that the stairs in the camp building system are broken, dysfunctional and make no sense.  Which is why I made this thread.
---
I make my caps by making ammo and selling it pre and post sbq. I‚Äôm talking tens of thousands of rounds. I was having some trouble with copper‚Äî but this new mining space will help me make more money and keep my wife and my energy weapons topped off. Cheers mate
---
It helps to have something to look forward to every Tuesday. Also for me, shits hard these days.
---
Ive yet to find it in a c.a.m.p vendor at on point in time I offered all 30k caps for the plans . but no one had them so I blew the caps for now though all I do it rack up and sell stuff constantly.
---
Your gonna need to buy some levels for sure then, but only if you want all the rewards.
---
The only NW challenges I do is place CAMPS and sourvive for 30 minutes (I AFK under water for 2-3 rounds while I watch a something)
---
the workshop was owned.
---
Morgantown. I started near monogah  town. But poseidon plant has two bugs usually. One exactly at the entrance and one close by near the radioactive barrels.
---
Then I found a ghoul on the road going out the plant, and 2 grafton monsters.
---
It was owned by another player probably
---
Best thing was someone who was level 1005
---
Just bought the greenhouse cause I love the look of it.  What's the bug with it?
---
Ugh that's ridiculous I need to buy them. What's the point of the challenges then?
---
However they did it, I just think they should do at least one double XP week. Wouldn‚Äôt hurt any but would def give week day players a chance
---
Dupers, but they have hundreds of thousands
---
someone dropped them off, trying to not get banned or just dumping weight. but like he said 1400 isn't anything, have multiple friends with multi millions in their vendors
---
The rust clone idea was before during the games devethats why they put no npc's in it.
---
Not much of a difference, but there's also the Miner Hat and its clean variant. Looks more retro than the Mining Helmet
---
To give us the opportunity to gain the levels we can. Though I understand the frustration .
---
Would you say it‚Äôs safe to open them
---
Never experienced this one
---
How much does a level cost?
---
Basically after lunch when no one did any pvp. They even removed the slap damage.
---
Even if it does its 1 lb max, so you might be able to get 801 lbs with it
---
Ik it'd be "lore breaking" and stuff but it'd be so cool to see the BOS swoop in one day and set up camp. Like have a fleet of vertiberds or something show up.
---
Ah! Thank you!
---
No i didn't üòÇ but i can tell that the gold doesnt go all the way down. Only the first half of those towers are full of gold bullion and then they are empty. I could make a video exploring that room but i don't know how to upload a video hereüòÖ (kinda new in reddit)
---
I'm gonna go way out on a limb and say the stack-able dupe a couple of months ago. I was gifted \~5500, I gave \~5000 to my mule for holding and opened \~500.
---
Even on console I would love a server text chat. Wendigo colossus on me. Project paradise my team on habitat A. Ect. Would be even better if I could use the Xbox app on my phone to type. I suppose it is actually possible now. But would involve starting a party and first messaging the whole server to let them know the intention of the party invite, just text chat for call outs worthy of being cast server wide. No mics. And then inviting the entire server. Super clunky and time consuming.
---
150 atoms
---
\~2000 hours in, and i have no idea what you are talking about..
---
5 is doable in one game. Just need to hug the edge of the circle
---
Reminds me of the Madonna and Jesus sculpture ‚ÄúPieta‚Äù by Michelangelo.   Good shot!
---
What? That's expensive af for one level. Do they have any bundle packs where you can get like 3 or 5 levels at a time?
---
p.s. if it looked unowned on the map but you got the wanted level, there's a visual bug not showing the player icons on the map
---
Biggest thing that gets me is trying to use my VATS enhanced .44, and missing all 6 rounds with a 95% hit chance, in defiance of all statistics.
---
No unfortunately though idk how many of your atom world challenges you've done, but I've gotten thousands from finishing those or remaking a character and doing the lower level ones again.
---
What if I unequip the perk on accident? Will my deathclaw do a 180 and start trying to tear me apart again?
---
You ur brain a little more baby boy. I played only that Jen thinking that was the only new content up date so I didn‚Äôt even try to find the new shit.
---
If you are on xbox hmu I collect them by the hundreds and almost never use them
---
Damn. I guess I'll have to figure this out then
---
Oh no, you only need it on for the actual taming. After that you can switch back to whatever skills you were using before.
---
Just had the same thing happen for opening a safe at a claimed camp. I don't see how this warrants a bounty.
---
You are not supposed to use the back door. Get in the front. You need to talk to the robo.
---
So now a bloodied build can get all his bloodied build friends into a team then share tge rad sponge card? I would like to see that.
---
Got a question : Besides having a front lamp, does the SS Armor helmet protect for disease ? 
---
I'm hesitant to buy the plans just for that.
---
Yeah but I let it happen. I know what they‚Äôre doing and I let them lol.
---
Yeah that's true but that's something most people do. It's not something a sandbox game necessarily enforces
---
Would it fix after another reload or is this week fkd up now?
---
Actually, I think if those items are broken, you can choose to store them and the place them down again at full health.
---
Or food. A guy was greifing a few of my friends, so I went and attacked him, didn‚Äôt fight back, seemed revenge, and destroyed his camp. I then destroyed all of his crops. Got daily messages cussing me out because he couldn‚Äôt find where to get a ton of tatos, melons, and mutfruit, so he had to go through and manually repair each and every thing because he couldn‚Äôt use repair all.
---
Very true. My poor game library and Game Pass being neglected big time.
---
this is my first play through so yea i'm a bit new to the game even after all this time it's been out. sorry you're scared :c
---
With full Incisor, the difference in Anti Armour between DCG and Puncturing Power Fist is just 5% though, not really worth losing the style points.
---
one character
---
Please no. This game needs a sustainable infusion of content more than my cash.
---
Okay thanks for the tip, it's pretty frustrating. You wonder how many people they have on staff. I know their player base is massive, but damn.. And you wouldn't think the pandemic would have affected them too much since they can literally just work from home probably (I'm not sure exactly how they operate so I could be wrong on that). Anyways thanks for the updates ü§ô
---
i only have one character and i am pressing the inspect/repair option. there are 0 basic kits and 0 improved kits
---
ah damn, im on pc, thank you :D
---
The weeklies that are already completed are fvcked. The dailies that are already completed are fvcked. I have had it happen once, and i was looking at the challenges as they "spawned" while auto completing. From this and what i have been told by others, have found that following that advice, it hasnt happened again. I lost 4500 that day, but havent had issues since I started making sure everything was spawned begore looking at it.
---
Well, I'm not suggesting it destroys the SBQ.  The SBQ has to be a bullet sponge for gameplay purposes.  But a typical Lv. 50 Scorchbeast?  It deserves some consideration, I think.
---
What most likely happened was someone had a bunch of them, opened a lot, found they either were way overencumbered or near max caps, and dropped those to shed weight.
---
I think Fallout 5 will be out b4 that at least for me
---
Ooooh good point! I‚Äôll check. I‚Äôm currently checking out the Reboot perk (self Rez in power armor).
---
If I‚Äôm seeing this right, it doesn‚Äôt work like the wording implies... it works in a way that is good for bloodied builds too! I‚Äôll post updates once I‚Äôve confirmed this.
---
Hell yeah same sit my ass in the AC and explore the wasteland
---
Only thing better than trap camps are how mad they make people.
---
Pretty sure the grognak's axe counts.
---
That would literally be paying to win.
---
Do you use the Healing Factor mutation?
---
I have that outfit and I have never tried it on lol. So I did not know that it did this.
---
oh ok im just picking any workbench rn lol so i CAN repair with junk, that solves that. but i paid for the repair kits :c lol i guess i'll just have to take the L
---
no i didn't lol it's my first play through, blind. so idk wtf im doing lol
---
DCG is tha best
---
no? i didn't even know that was a thing. i have the melee one currently
---
checked already :/
---
Genuinely how bad are you? It's seriously not hard at all
---
I agree. Although I also enjoy playing NW anyway so I don‚Äôt care what the number is
---
Would definitely support items like the Arktos Labcoat and Flyboy Outfit hiding backpacks, or even just an invisible backpack skin.
---
I believe the explosive bait will attract the scorchbeasts and cause it to land.
---
Probably this. Didn't see it claimed... had actually repaired one of the guns out front. Does it take a death to a player to clear the bounty? Or can I suicide to critters...
---
?
---
Just a little reminder...
---
If it's about the stable flux... No one "stole" it, it disappears when you die in the event zone.
---
Check player vendors for the serum.  It regenerates health when you aren't in combat.
---
You seem like you got banned for duping.
---
yeah accidentally initiated PVP a few too many times by claiming without looking lol
---
Just logged in and it‚Äôs exactly the same for me.
---
Sorry i couldnt get to you sooner......
---
I ran into the pipe for the first time on a through away acount but never in my main account that I have over 600 hours in. the pipe is truley life
---
As if that's hard.
---
Lmao I totally thought about this one yesterday. I would be SOOO GOOD at it.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right. I was using a mismatched torso; adding a mismatched helmet and I lost the poison resist effect. 
---
The self-Rez is also golden for bloodied PA builds- making a separate post about that
---
I am almost halfway there
---
Wait till ps5 for a good game to come out
---
no worries :)
---
I'm with you on this. I see 3+ per game lol.
---
go on...
---
I'm mothman (in a gruff voice)
---
So that‚Äôs what the cap is. I had no idea since I use both bandolier and batteries included.
---
Still, good to know, thank you!
---
You mean like access to a private world, a survival tent or scrapbox?
---
We already have this in a way with some of these skins that cover everything and change power armor armor types.
---
Personally I would prefer things be more tangible than less. The game seriously suffers from a lack of permanent anything but we are already heading in the direction you want OP.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt know that. While I was a little salty when I thought people stole my flux, my main frustration still is the fact that I can‚Äôt just shoot the guy back to pick up my stuff. I can‚Äôt put a bounty on them either.
---
Obviously not as good as you, I guess... Why so rude? What's easy for you isn't automatically easy for everyone.
---
He's replying with a solution to your problem and you answer him in this tone?? FWIW, he's completely right, you have to switch to the vanilla and then delete.
---
I feel like an amateur now! :O
---
Make sure to do all the challenges and you'll get there. Might have to buy a few at the end unless you pick up on the xo repeatable grind.
---
Paying to win the free items that anyone can earn? Doesn‚Äôt sound like pay to win to me if you can unlock the exact same thing as someone with fo1st...
---
How is that pay to win, everything is cosmetic
---
&gt;Will you be crediting those atoms which went to the wrong balance?
---
I should have an update for you on this relatively soon. Stay tuned!
---
I mean, I guess what I said needed downvotes.
---
I sure as hell wouldn't want to see that. We've already got the scrapbox, the tent, the 1.6k atoms every month plus some exclusive outfits. Christ, next you'll be asking for someone to dress in a vault suit and wipe your ass while telling you that this is your personal Reclamation Day. 
---
We get enough for the price.
---
I get you. It happens to all of us, forgetting to not carry the scrap to the event .)
---
It's the same as the FO1st tent skins. You "activate" the skin for the next time it is used. That's the mechanic, it's not dumb if you understand how it works.
---
End-game is based on cheap tactics like grinding, gambling (we're all [concerned mothers](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Concerned_mother)) and Fear of Missing Out. We need NewGame+
---
Yes you will
---
That does sounds fun, My guess with the low build limit I guess won't happen much.
---
It covers a bunch of ground as far as weekly /dailies go. It covers take over workshop/vertibird/event for defend,scorched,kill creature,get a crit and so on. Plus it‚Äôs near liberators and grafton monster for another quest. You need five kills of five types watoga will get you three/4 types of robots at best so this location is worthwhile. Not to mention it triggers power up Poseidon.
---
is addiction a random effect upon consuming any chem/booze? or do u need to do it a bunch within a short window?
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a free update for it.
---
As opposed to just paying atoms to move spaces.
---
&gt; Why are Deathclaws no threat to anyone but your own sanity because you played previous games and they just suck in comparison? 
---
Ran into a L91 glowing deathclaw last night. "Oh shit!"
---
Four quick shots of my plain old vanilla combat rifle from stealth and its dead.
---
im aware, but that doesnt help for the new legendary perk system
---
Much respect there, welcome back homie
---
Ya its a free dlc. Granted youll have a few hours of update.
---
Why are there diseased robots? Robots are robots. They can't get sick.
---
Why can't you meet Julie or visit Appalachia Radio, even though she's clearly a real, living person?
---
Why are there level 60+ charred ferals at Whitesprings, an area that doesn't have other 60+ enemies anywhere near it?
---
Why can't I let Beckett keep his default outfit but just add a chef's hat? I like the leather jacket! I just want to add a hat without making the rest of him naked for some reason!!
---
as a level 58 obviously this isn't possible yet, but a full set of Secret service armor will give you great radiation resistance (rivaling power armor) and you won't be getting insta killed like in a radiation suit, since it forces all your armor off and you'll have 0 damage resistance, I suggest grinding for the secret service armor as soon as possible
---
Mods give 15% and the legendary prefix gives 50% and incisor gives 75% and it's multiplicative. 1-0.12√ó0.5√ó0.75=0.94375. That's about 94.4% armour ignored. Without the anti armour mod and legendaey prefix it's only 75% reduction with full incisor
---
Yea I must be a cheater b/c I don‚Äôt get my panties twisted over people playing the game. 
---
Solid logic
---
Don‚Äôt mean to rain on your parade, but level 50 is more like a third of the way.
---
Well I'm putting my dragonplate over my hazmat suit either way.
---
If you purchase FO76, you automatically get Wastelanders. Wastelanders is not a separate mode from base game.
---
If it took them a day to implement this it would be alot
---
You could easily pass it by, I can't imagine getting so upset by seeing a post about a game I don't like, that I'd have to click it, just to throw shade.
---
norcal here, i work outside in 108 degree heat
---
They never said it was fixed? They added logging last week to be able to see what is causing it, but I have not seen anything about a fix yet.
---
I think that's what I'm gonna do, try to get through enough missions to get that checked off then double back on the neglected ones
---
Love the reference. Definitely got the fear of missing out. What am I missing out on?  Punishment mostly lol. NewGame+ would definitely be interesting.
---
They've said a few times now in various spots that STASH space limitations are on their minds and they're looking for ways to increase them globally.  They've recognized the complaint.  At beta, STASH was limited to 400 lbs.  They increased it to 600 in Dec. 2018, then to 800 in Feb. 2019.  Hopefully we'll see it increase again.
---
The FO1st SCRAP box was a step- a paid step, as OP mentions.  But it's a lot easier to store data for scrap than other items.  It's just one database entry for each type: "Scrap Lead 10393" takes about the same amount of database space as "Scrap Lead 3," so they can afford to stretch the servers for that.
---
The problem is the "heavy" items:  Armor, power armor pieces, weapons. (And to a lesser extent, fusion cores and food that has a condition rating to track.) A rifle with six different mods, three legendary stats, a given level of durability at a given wear level, and so on takes considerably more database overhead than a pile of scrap.  And most players have several such items in their stash, in addition to the dozen or more they keep on their person. Multiply that by XXXXX players and by Y characters per player, and it becomes a pretty deal.
---
I think part of the confusion is conflating weight with stash space.  That makes sense for personal inventory, but not so much for stash.  B. chose to give everyone 800 lbs. of stash space as a placeholder to limit each character's database storage.  No idea how you'd convert it over at this point (likely some kind of statistical exercise across current player base inventories), but maybe 400 slots would be easier to swallow than 800 pounds?
---
What others are trying to say is that the effects on it are bugged and doing unintended amounts of damage. Gonna be fixed sooner or later, so have fun while it lasts.
---
Thanks!  It's appreciated.
---
96¬∞ here feels like 100¬∞ in WV ü•µ
---
Good, now make it default for all future seasons and add bonus event challenges and double score events every so often and the whole thing won't look like such a cash grab.
---
I've definitely had a significantly higher number of crashes since the last patch.  Swapping characters and trying to load into a server is about 50/50.  General fast traveling to locations is a crash maybe about 5% of the time now.
---
Then there's Line in the Sand... which I mostly attribute to hacked weapons overloading the already fragile engine.
---
Southwest. Did the SCORE thing for the first time yesterday. I need 1 more level for ammo converter, but i am working today
---
Blue suitcase at WSS
---
can (insert insult of choice here) players kill the chickens like they can brahmin? or is it free from 24/7 repairs?
---
Well, might not be the truest definition of pay 2 win but definitely would be paying for extra advantage anyway. More SCORE earning opportunities for the subscribers? Yeah, that would end well.
---
The Blood Eagle jacket you get from Beckett's quest also has a cool Blood Eagle logo on the back which you can pretty much never see unless you put it on an ally.
---
I've rolled 3 pieces of unyielding with less than 4 tries on each, I figured it just wasn't that hard lol
---
Im just now past the space ship slide.  Only started playing the game about 8 or 9 days ago.  I may have to buy a few levels towards the end but it will be worth it.
---
Definitely, even if the max damage only happens at direct impact. It would be so epic if someone fires his Fatman head-on at a diving SB and send it flying. It‚Äôs like shooting down a Mig with an RPG in BF, totally satisfying.
---
Yeah, I love paying my money to get an advantage to earning COSMETIC skins
---
sorry my english is bad but im talking about the first door to the left when u come in to the room if that makes any sense, always takes 5 sec before i can go through
---
So it doesn't bump you back up to 25% like respawning does? That's...beautiful.
---
Polly (Duchess' Assaultron guard) seems to be more or less fully self aware and posesses a very humanoid set of emotions and whatnot. She even lets slip a genuine "Thank God!" when you tell her youve helped Sol.
---
Seems to be a pretty good place to start.
---
And then theres Rose, who is not only self aware, but likes tripping on chems.
---
FWIW, some of us don't have stash boxes next to vending because there was an theft exploit that relied on that a while back.
---
The thing I watch out for the most are camps that force you to access the vending in a certain way.   The more narrow and small the access, the more I avoid them.   And I don't do underground camps at all after having been killed a few times in them.
---
Welcome to the wasteland! It‚Äôs come a long way since launch. Still lots of problems, but fun. Good luck on the grind üí™üèº
---
first thing: forget about bloody for the moment. yes, it does damage as fuck but you need the gear, the aid and basic knowledge of the game. learn to manage your radiation on a full health character first. you can always go for a second character with your acquired knowledge or rebuild your perks later.  
---
think basic, what fits your generel playstyle the most: melee? ranged? sneaky? heavy gunner? there are hundreds of possibilities in this game.  
---
you could have a look at [this character planer](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks), go through the perks, play around.
---
Same here, every time I die on any character, even the one I made a week ago.  Encryptid is basically impossible but thankfully SBQ hits are weaker than a charred ghoul and I never die on scorched earth.   But man is it annoying, project paradise and encryptid are the worst
---
if you do want to spec for power armor though the t65 secret service power armor takes less time than the SS armor itself, because with the armor you have to buy all the mods and the jetpack, and the under armor, and the mod for that, and then roll them all out to try and get your desired rolls, the SS armor is just annoying...
---
Yeah funny now that the anti PvP guys are getting to vetran numbers and wanting the thing they spent so much time to get rid of
---
You will &amp; you should buy it !
---
Seems to me to depend on the server for some strange reason. I'll be playing on a server and all of a sudden realise that no public events have popped up for the whole time Ive been playing. I'll switch to a different server and then it'll be fine.
---
I think the general consensus is that there isn't a case where you can complete the board without passing Zorbo at some point.  He represents the approaching end of the Season and serves as a rough guideline for how far along you should be at this point.
---
Ideally, you should be ahead, because the going only gets tougher as the SCORE requirements grow by +25 each rank, but Zorbo moves at a consistent pace.
---
This sounds more promising, I hope many of these perks are touched up on
---
That was my old go to spot but then one day I found a bunch of junk weapons in the cash register at the Rusty Pick and I was like "I like that!"
---
i think chickenshit would be appropriate
---
You don't even have to be good? Do you guys play nothing other than Fallout 76?
---
It really should it's a better catch than a god roll
---
I couldn‚Äôt even see them in the shop though
---
I do love my fish bowl lamp
---
I have never been " anti PvP "
---
Can you get eggs from the chicken?
---
There's a bug where sometimes you can't move or scrap the greenhouse. It just gives an "unspecified error" and refuses to do it.
---

---
No, you are both replying with a work around, which would not be necessary if the system worked in a way that was intuitive and made sense. Which it does not.  And vanilla is exactly what I was  using.   But the type of stairs should not matter. The fact that they matter at all is a problem.  I specifically said in my original post that ***I did every possible thing you can imagine to delete it***.
---
That discount is only for FO1st members:

---
Mine were either under floor decor or misc structures. I didn't place them, but they were in one of those categories when I was decorating my camp
---
I got gang banged by three wendigos the other day. It was definitely not tasteful.
---
Lol yeah that sounds like a whole thing. I feel like when the time comes ill probably make an alt and spec it that way.
---
Does it by chance snap to foundation or am I going to have to get all jankie with it for it to fit?
---
I placed a concrete foundation block and the attached a ladder and didn't like where it was located. Then I tried to delete the ladder to move the block and it says  **"Part of the structure will be inaccessible"** there is nothing attached to the ladder so I just had to leave it because it will not let me delete any of it now?
---
I also pick up all prewar money,  scrap it then bulk the cloth and sell, as it‚Äôs one of the easiest items to find
---
I didn't sign up for NW. I bought Fallout 76 long before NW was even announced. I give Fallout 76 my best.
---
You must have a small brain if you can't even imagine it.  It's not much different from replying to a comment you don't like, dummy.
---
Spawn the Bolton Greens. Four times out a five I found enough mutant hounds to complete this easy challenge in a single game.
---
Elaborate?
---
I haven't had that problem, but the mirelurk kings don't like me. I can tank the sbq and all her thrashing, but a mirelurk king can take me in just a few seconds if I'm not prepared. Running serendipity, fireproof, ricochet, blocker, and nerd rage helps a lot. I'll usually use power armor during the queen fight, but anywhere else it's not really neccessary and unyielding is king.
---
I'm no hardcore player, but I think the build does pretty well for a casual build.
---
Srry I ment you where like the 20th post like this in the last 48 hours, story short most gear good in the is decent in PvP the only real thing tou have to do now is reach the 110 damage cap and use cola nut and sheath boys so you dont just instant die
---
You‚Äôre buikd isn‚Äôt right?  The mods on pc u use screwed it up?  No idea. I‚Äôll tell ya want as I really can‚Äôt be arsed. It doesn‚Äôt stack. Just one piece is all u need. Enjoy your build.
---
Much as I hate toxic online environments, if the developers won't address it, vigilante counter-griefing is the only alternative....
---
Wow this makes the level 6000 person  from that screenshot, even more fishy than before.
---
I did and it glitched again :(
---
A workaround for this is use a shotgun with Enforcer rank 3 and aim for the wings. VATS isn't even required too.
---
Yeah.  I think a more ideal solution would have been to have the Sheepsquatch *head* be an Atomic Shop thing, but not the standalone horns.
---
Yeah they do checks for common legacy legendary effects and large amounts of item even junk can get you flagged for this.
---
They are a fo1st only discount so if you don't have it I don't think you can see it. They are under floor decor too.
---
I've done this a couple of times to trap camps. We'll done my friend
---
Yup, I would click purchase while I had the funds, either the shop or the game would crash (usually with a message like "the store has been updated") and then suddenly the amount would be reverted.
---
Those with little intellect generally resort to name calling. I pity you and your sad existence. I hope you have a nice day.
---
üòë
---
I would assume them to be added under the Defense tab, but I guess they could be in the Floor Decorations or the miscellaneous sections.
---
Ha! I knew it. Smiley must have taken the rest.
---
yeah disease resistance but no energy or damage resistance, i bought it as my first SS piece and I regret it. since its more expensive than literally any other piece and I never ever ever wear it
---
Do you have fallout 1st?
---
technically the tattered mole head is the best headwear...it gives you a grand total of 1 damage resistance lmao
---
If I trapped people and they survived they deserve the loot.
---
As I understand it, you get nothing.  Atoms were already out of the picture, but they aren't even offering Caps, Bullion, or Scrip.
---
I suspect that as more players complete the Season, though, something may have to give on that.
---
I spent 8 months wondering where I kept getting so much weight  
---
3 weeks ago I checked the misc tab only to realize that Ore didn't count as junk. And I had hundrerds
---
I'll join. I'm redzone04. On just about every night on pc

Humans turn into loot bags when they die (much like players) instead of becoming meat piles. It's actually a cool little detail that came along with wastlanders.
---
Still waiting on any kind of Tesla rifle skin
---
I didn't know about the magazine/bobble route.  I'm just gonna go ahead a google that real quick. ;)
---
If you‚Äôre not finding satisfaction donating your money to Bethesda, there are many worthy charities out there. You spend $100 a year to get unlimited scrap, an extra free travel point you can put anywhere, free Atoms, and some cosmetics. If that‚Äôs honestly not enough for you, then are you really going to be happy with a few extra daily challenges?
---
what's the level for this reward?
---
I have decided to leave 1000 keep 100 and give 20 to every player if I can
---
Suggested caption...
---
Mothman: Lunchtime!
---
Of course. Not to mention it shouldn't be an Atom Shop item in the first place. Just like every single other mounted head
---
Thanks for the tip, and that makes all the ghouls respawn?
---
Sitting through 18,000 loading screens when trying to do dailies.
---
76 is the only online game I've played since Ultima Online in the 90s. 
---
But, yes, I play other games. Just not with other people.  
---
In general, NW loads, I get my bearings, start looking for weapons and some guy one shits me from a Bush. 
---
Occasionally I make it to a box, get a gun and do alright, but that's rare.
---
oh sorry have not seen other posts on the subject i got a qffr fr tesla + tons of explosive lasers and a uny/sent/ap scout set im thinking of trading for a ass/sent/ap set. But i dont want to do it if PvP is dead :s
---
Power armor is completely inconvenient to me, I take more damage in it and can carry less in it. If only PA had legendary variants like regular armor.
---
Unless it does and I'm just completely unaware.
---
The one from the Raiders/Crater reputation quests I believe. Not the Legendary Run P.O.S.
---
OK, look at your post history, literally \*ALL\* you do is complain... Play another game, move on. If you're just venting on Reddit, what are you hoping to achieve? Don't reply like a keyboard warrior, no point.
---
There will be F1st 'benefits in future seasons, this season was more of a test to make sure everything works
---
Better than them prioritizing going out of business.
---
I know no one wants to hear this, but 76 is a business, and has to clear a pretty hefty profit or they'll pack up and move their assets to something that makes them more money.  
---
And no, the fact that other franchises make lots of money doesn't matter, they can cut out the low earning assets and use them to make more elsewhere.  I'm sure their investors are expecting it, so in a way their hands are a bit tied.
---
I don't know how much 76 is making in profits (which would be interesting to know), but in this business, performance is *very* important.  They have to balance making more money against losing customers, so it's not completely one sided, but since we can't see the balance it's hard to judge right now.
---
You have 2 options:
---
* 1) Wait for the item in question to be completely broke.
---
* 2) Store the item in question.
---
I'm telling ya, Sol and Polly are definitely banging. They just don't wanna let us know it
---
Rocksy is also thicc
---
How do you have all that budget?
---
It unfortunalty is kinda dead now all that happens are organized skirmishes and even those are tough to set up jow
---
I misread the question,yes I do but they weren't labeled as first when I bought them, and they're not listed under first when I look at the atom shop
---
Congrats man, really nice achievement üëçüëç
---
Whaaaaaat? Really?
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
No.  And I say that as a 1st subscriber.  We shouldn't get an advantage in terms of special bonus challenges or SCORE.
---
Besides, Private Servers already provide something of an indirect advantage if you know what you're doing.
---
NukaCrypt has 'em.
---
Theyre about to reset in a few hours so watch out.

The Queen normally lands at least once.
---
The real anoyance is normal scorched beast, they do tend to just attack you then change agro and fly away.
---
I'm happy the chickens come with it lol :)
---
We get those too...
---
I'm very tempted, as hunting and stuff is sort of my gimmick with mounted heads and all that cool stuff. But I'm gonna wait until the last second to decide incase they release anything themed around the colossus event coming up.
---
They're loot crates with legs.
---
I should probably stop carrying like 500 stimpacks and 1400 radaways üòÇ
---
Sometimes I just sit in the camp I built because I‚Äôm proud of it, it beats standing at Whitesprings Station, and it totally is relaxing.
---
Bugged then maybe?
---
You need to change their receiver to the 'Prime' variant. To learn how to craft said variants you can get them if scorchbeasts, scorchbeast queen, or players
---
Im so heavy because of pepperoni rolls and a lack of exercise.
---
There will also be hourly complain threads about events failing or people only ‚Äúdrumming‚Äù.
---
You need a prime receiver. The plans drop from the queen and rarely from regular scorchbeasts.
---
Bolton Greens usually, like 8 out of 10 times, has a couple of mutant hounds spawn. You could try that, perhaps.
---
Weird i can craft these when did they stop becoming avalible
---
&gt; Play another game,
---
Load your weapon with ultracite ammo. Should do the trick üëç
---
I mean, you clearly do since that's exactly what you asked for in your post.

I would love this!  It would help to know who to play before loading into a world.

Can we have groceries backpack and chemistry backpack all at once?

The limits on caps and gold.
---
Was thinking it could have been me but it's been I think at least a week since I've done that event!  The longcoat has been my usual go to lately.  With the bog mask or hat and patrolman glasses.
---
People overcharge for digital things for no reason other than greed, I would‚Äôve sold that outfit for 700 and I would‚Äôve given the gun away, little FYI if you happen to see my camp on Xbox I always undersell people
---
While it added an epic amount of gameplay and game elements, Wastelanders is really a game update, not a paid dlc, so there is no charge.
---
Thnk you for the suggestion! I will have to try that.
---
The second one doesn't do anything. Like a percent of a percent improvement. INV is basically just a access spreadsheet with a bunch of hexadecimals on it.
---
What sheep head?
---
Just like green eggs and ham, how do you know you don't like it until you try it? It sounds like you have some pre-conceived notions from comparing it to other Battle Royale games. Much like life, it is what you make of it. I enjoy spawning in near the river in Morgantown and slipping under the surface to face the match. It's quiet, peaceful, just me and the fishes. I may have to pop up to place a camp or two for the challenges, but I'm about to unlock the Ghille suit and then may not boot it up again after SCORE is done.
---
TLDR; It's not about frenetic killing of other players all the time.
---
May i ask your name i am on xbox now
---
At the very least google the word 'literally'. It seems to be troubling you.
---
You're welcome. Yes, all the ghouls will respawn, you have somewhere around 5 minutes to reload back in the same server/world.  It's been that way since release for some reason without being addressed.
---
Hmm, you do need a radiation suit or power armor since you will probably die and respawn in the nuke zone when fighting the queen.
---
A good idea for nuke zones it good damage resistance since you never know when a legendary enemy will sneak up on you, especially when you gun is pointing to the sky shooting scorched beasts.
---
If your on Xbox I can see if I have the receiver for you just lmk
---
Free of course
---
I‚Äôm not on there now, telling people if they ever see me in the future, and you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs me if you see me
---
There has never been a psychotats recipe.
---
More to the point, how did you get the recipe?  I have played on both PC and XBox since the game came out and have seen every drug recipe except this one.
---
My favorite match ended in a draw!  I was the last alive on my team facing a team of 3.  I nuked all of us. I only wish I could have seen the look on their faces when the match ended in a draw.
---
Do you understand that you just admitted to having little intellect?
---
Thank you for informing me anyway, it is nice to know someone isnt trying to bleed the items for what they arent worth.
---
Is that still bugged? I remember when the game came out and I spent all my atoms on that thing, only for the stomach texture to be all janky
---
No problem. You might need a few tries though because it's chosen by more people when this is the challenge so someone with a faster load-in time might get them before you.
---
I believe i got it from the savage divide back when you got reciepes based on region specific materials
---
Pretty sure they aren't publicly listed company so there are no shareholders expecting anything, just greedy bosses.
---
Your point holds but considering this is a pay to play game, many of us played in full for the tricentenial too. Also video games never used to have any of this shit. Just because it has become the new norm doesn't mean you should defend it.
---
Like would you be happy for several tolls to be put on roads you frequently use to get to work for example, with the excuse "oh the roads need maintenance" even though you already paid for that with taxes and registration.
---
It looks impressive on paper but in real fights it‚Äôs only good for dealing with a large hoard of low levels from a distance, and that situation doesn‚Äôt often happen lol. Yes legendary effects make dedicated explosive weapons less relevant, then the bosses have ‚Äòhidden‚Äô explosive resistance to make them even more useless.
---
My quests just show up when i'm close.. go to crater and see if it pops up?
---
Like basically all of it.
---
I‚Äôm not the only one, you just gotta look around
---
Allegedly, looks inedible.

This is what I like to but pvp has to many one shotting legacy weapons that people will be but hurt to give up.
---
That and nuka quantum is very strong and needs slower over time regen.
---
The easiest way to do this is spawn in a place near the border, in Morgantown, try the Prison, the Camp, Monaghah. Once in, hide out a bit until the map starts closing in, there will usually be a number of creatures that spawn in as the ring starts to close.
---
lol but rare situation like this makes it all worth it.
---
That makes sense. Hopefully I can manage to pull it off. Lol
---
Leg, is nimble
---
*okay*
---
This game, that is really enjoyable to play freely and chilling is getting a very weird FOMO vibe I don't like at all
---
Confirmed that they are under floor decor if anyone wanted to know. Lol
---
Nice! Never noticed that detail
---
Sheepsquach mounted head and horns.
---
It‚Äôs like $20 chill lmfaooooo

If you're short on time and don't want to grind your high level character to another levelup the solution is to keep a character slot as a throwaway to make a new character every day that will level up to level 2 automatically by time you leave the vault for that sweet, sweet 500 score. Score is account-wide after all.  
---
When this season started I was at about level 300 (somewhere between level 290 and 305 I think) and I just hit level 358 and score rank 55 this morning. So it's taken me about one level up per score rank doing almost all the challenges (skipped some NW, not gonna lie). I've been leveling up almost 6 times more per day than I was before they started this seasons thing, but I haven't been playing more hours. I think it's just because I changed my play style from very casual/building stuff to mostly chasing XP.
---
Oh cool I be got something to use my atoms I payed for with the money I earned working a job
---
Prime plans. Dupers flooded the game with these
---
L√§mp
---
  \    /
---
(O'v'O)
---
You‚Äôre getting shit on but we‚Äôll definitely see f1st get an advantage in season 2 it would be stupid of them not too. Fortnite does it you have to buy the pass to get access to the challenges so I totally see them doing it in the future
---
Im on ps4 but its a really rare mod?
---
check again bud
---
These kids don‚Äôt get it they‚Äôre just bitter they don‚Äôt have 13 a month to spend I guess
---
This, it's hilarious killing a bloatfly with a single shot and looting a nuke code and superstim off it
---
Yup, it just jumps you back up to wherever your rads are at. And the icon flash is on the left edge of the screen too, not blocking the middle like so many other things do!
---
Yes and It makes no sense
---
No i just want a headwear that has a gas mask and frontal lamp.
---
AFAIK, SS helmet is the only one
---
i am sorry you work outside :(
---
There's more to it than that. When people use vendors as traps, it's not in the spirit that it was intended, and it makes players (understandably) suspicious of all player vendors, including those of us who genuinely like selling to other players and providing a place for them to rest and craft.
---
Why are people complaining so much about the NW challenge? Challenge, singular. Literally one out of 8 or 9 we get every day. People who like playing NW only get 1/8 or 1/9 the challenges you get. They don't have a choice but to play adventure mode too if they want to make any progress in the season. Meanwhile, adventure mode only players have more than enough challenges to get through the whole season without ever touching NW. It's a BONUS for you. If you're not willing to put in the extra work, don't feel entitled to the extra bonus
---
Yep- if you missed my other post, the poison resist (and likely the fire resist) perks for matching armor sets ALSO work with power armor, and at least for now only require 5 matching pieces- you can have 1 mismatched of the 6 PA pieces and it still works. This is likely a bug/oversight (hahaha bethesda) but it's how it works for now.
---
I have had access to every wallpaper released for months now, its a bug thay I am very surprised is not fixed yet.
---
Edit: However just checking now, the only wallpapers I have access too are ones that are on the atom shop. If they get phased out, I lose access, but every wallpaper on the shop currently I do have despite never buying them.
---
2000 (?) atoms a month is extra score. At least when you will be able to purchase levels.
---
For reference I'm a where of nuka crypt but I was hoping somebody had I direct code so I didn't have to grind for the key cards but guess I don't have much other choice lol
---
Damn, Diablo 2 is 20 years old already? Now I feel old, thanks.
---
They mentioned legendary perks as their take on NG+, having at least gold bullion plans account wide would help tho.
---
Because they HAD to charge for at least one right? /s
---
To further expand on this great tip that I wish everyone does, is during a queen fight or encryptid, you can double dip on hunting XP, then event XP, then back to building. You have to be really quick with it at encryptid but the queen gives you about 10-15 seconds to do it. As soon as one of them is getting low on health, switch to hunting. AS SOON as it dies, switch to events. Wait for the XP from the event, then switch back to building.
---
Same, super weird. Wondering if I should even put them up. Seems like something they‚Äôd flag and ban for because.. Bethesda
---
And on that note here I go
---
Sort by weight and it should be near the top. Possible you missed them maybe.
---
Oh please do explain, because you must have mistaken someone else for my, as I not once resorted to name calling. Please read the conversation again, your mistake is quite humorous.
---
Congrats mr-e-nigma! Hit me up gt is Blacktyde83 and I‚Äôll give it to you! Everyone else I‚Äôd be happy to help you with other gear if you‚Äôd like!
---
Just imagine if teams were added over a year ago when they should have been available from the start.
---
Shhhhhh!
---
Seems that way.
---
Congrats! Hit me up gt is Blacktyde83 and I‚Äôll get you the armor!
---
Ah.. I miss the good ol' days when *everything was a wendigo*
---
Just whatever you do don't Google the weapon name.
---
I beleive you can buy it from the enclave med vendor still to
---
I was told they rest on a Monday but if there about to reset I'll leave it to tomorrow to do that üëç thanks for the info
---
you‚Äôre a long Way Down The posts my friend haha. 
---
But yeah it doesnt Seem to have been fixed yet. 
---
Dunno if they have even acknowledged it yet.
---
Jetpack + cushioned legs, best mods
---
Buttressed is the best armor upgrade 'mod'
---
It‚Äôs just you Bronie
---
Sounds more like an actual region of the actual US than a kid‚Äôs show to me.
---
Its just to have Front Lamp + gas mask on the same headwear. And I allready have all the olans for armor, weapons and mods I need, and still stacking up to 4k golds on both my characters.
---
I wish NCR ranger helmet had a red frontal lamp in the eyes cause its the coolest but if not, SS helmet will do the trick.
---
Its just that i read on this sub that the SS helmet wasnt protecting from airborne diseases
---
Yeah maybe that‚Äôs the problem. I have no friends who play the game lol. 
---
But thanks! I will remember this for the future
---
How do you people not understand how this works yet? They figure out what people want the most and charge the most for it. They‚Äôre a business. Their job is to make money. It really isn‚Äôt that difficult.
---
Enunimes has these raging, expletive laden fits every now and then. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.
---
Of course they can. You don't need any specific perks for it though- it's just picking what chems you want to be addicted to (and their associated withdrawal effects).
---
Check out [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction) and scroll down to the '76 section.
---
Pick 5 (maximum Junkie's benefit).
---
It's a part of the weekly pack named the Big Game Hunter. Unfortunately it isn't listed separate, and the other offerings may be a bit basic, but there may be some fun to be had with the other items.
---
Ah.
---
I haven't looked into the Raider rewards, because I've no interest in grinding faction for a bunch of murderers and rapists.
---
This bug has been in the game since the game start and got progressively worse with updates. I have a camp with a stairway connected to nothing, just a foundation in a ground (Vanilla) and cannot be removed. I had to destroy my primary camp (2nd camp) just like Op to get rid of it. I had someone try help me remove it and nada. This is an old existing annoying bug that has been around forever. I get Op's frustration ... it's actually worse now.
---
Not just stairs will bug out, even floors will, I built another camp (3rd camp) in the mire and can't even remove regular floors. This isn't new, it's a bunch of camp bugs introduced with new updates that have made it worse overtime.
---
There‚Äôs usually ammo in my machine when I log on.
---
Same, the first thing I do when I see I‚Äôm being sent to the penitentiary is server hop lol. No shame.
---
I like Retirement Plan because I like convincing the former raider to go to Foundation instead. If he manages to still be alive when I get there lol.
---
Check again, there is no Psychotats recipe. There is one for Psycho and one for Psychobuffs, though.
---
He is whining cause he cant get it with his allowance
---
This is literally in every mmo, you guys have never play WoW and it shows
---
I have seen this too. I got one of these shotguns early on when playing (level 20) and was so confused why it did so much more damage than my other weapons. I don't use it anymore since bloodied stealth commando with a fixer is better than being point blank range and magic shotguns do nothing vs a SBQ. The shotgun is also useless outside vats and if the enemy is far away. You can bug the shotgun to be a sniper rifle though but so haven't tried. I saw it on YouTube. You give it negative range. That might be viable. It will be fixed though and also it still is just bad vs SBQ.
---
I thought you could also buy it from the med wing enclave vendor
---
I didn‚Äôt put a lot into Luck for VATS criticals. I am thinking about moving points around. Just... what to lower....
---
Except I play on oldschool PC and my wife on PS4. So there is no second pocket as with steam or gamepass :/
---
Who do you think you are? "this should do this and this should do that"
---
I feel jealousy in the air.
---
I think the NW community should adapt to these challenges. I myself put on my Tricentennial bobble head and costume, just go for a double barrel shotgun and equip frog legs so everyone knows I'm a meme.
---
My body is a temple, so I won't do mutations like marsupial or bloodied things.  So I agree buttressed on everything, jetpack, and cushioned legs.  I'm hoping they release carry weight for the arms at some point.
---
Yeah if you pick locks that players put in you‚Äôll get a bounty. Just like picking someone‚Äôs lock at their camp.
---
No it is already a glass cannon why brake it. There are already plenty of drawbacks as is.
---
I definitely have run into this bug with 3-4 camps of mine. I tried avoid using stairs and use them very sparingly ...but I feel your frustration .. they need a serious camp update.
---
Neither the Institute nor the Railroad even exist yet.
---
By the pictures I've seen of it I don't think it works as a foundation, it appears to stand somewhere about waist high, and if you look at the picture OP posted you can see the corner sticking off the ground, so I'm going to say it can probably be placed on top of a foundation.
---
This is just speculation, can anyone confirm?
---
So she just REALLY like robots?
---
my build is a silenced handmade, 35 agility, sneak 3, escape artist 3, chameleon mutation, 1 cha piece and 4 uny pieces with a single HTD piece. please, enlighten me. what am I doing wrong? why can't I replicate your results? my best guess is lag, but apparently you know something that I don't.
---
&gt;the mods on pc u use
---
I just tested it my dude. sat in front of a stationary group of ghouls inside the golf house. healed my rads, ended up with 20 agi. had a full set of unyielding (no effect because I was at 100% HP) HTD. I was on the brink of getting into caution.
---
started removing the HTD pieces one by one. no change on the bracket up to the 4th. removed the last one, went into caution. now what?
---
Lol
---
Thanks for the laugh friend.
---
You're thinking of psychobuff
---
Report it to Bethesda, and lets hope its patched in Patch 21
---
Well, no...the My Little Pony part is probably just you. But it does sound a lot like the Appaloosa horse breed.
---
78, I think.
---
Try FO 1st.
---
ouch, that's high. thanks though ^^
---
So, using atoms that come with to pay for score ranks isn't pay to win but this is? That's some real big brain logic. Besides, paying to win what exactly? A lamp? A suit? A power armor skin? A chicken coup? None of those help you win anything or give you any advantage.
---
It is annoying how selfish people can be. I never one shot the boss and I‚Äôm a bloodied stealth build so it would be easy. I‚Äôll shoot the ground near the boss with an exploding gun or bash him for minimal damage. I do the same for most legendaries in public servers.
---
There‚Äôs this sweet bunker with a kinda vault door coming. No idea when though.
---
PVP is the end game for some, but there is quite the learning curve to it. I think most players are not attracted to PVP because without a PVP-specific build you will be very ineffective.
---
 Perk focus on damage output/damage avoidance. Wave goodbye to all quality of life perks. The bonus- a good PVP build will be very strong in PVE as well.
---
Also, if you have a play group, I'd recommend just playing against them when starting out  And if you are sparring in a public server you might get the attention of other people that want to PVP.
---
Edit: as for "is PVP dead?" Well, entire PVP groups have been banned/suspended recently. Of these were some of the most fanatic supporters of the game. We'll see who comes back. Hopefully some fresh players fill the void.
---
‚ÄúWho the fuck is that guy‚Äù~ Conner McGregor
---
Nah, keep your job so you can just buy the levels you can't get at the end of the season. It would take less blood, sweat and tears that way. Or just deal with the fact that you won't get all the items. That's what I've come around to accepting.
---
Seeing West Tek makes me puke now. First time since October 2018 when i will finish the run (around 75 now) , i will uninstall the game and not look back for a while.
---
   The dailies and weekly challenges was what kept me logging in as often as i can.
---
I wish she had been a part of the raid. Would have loved to see her tell the agents a little about what respect means.
---
Edit: Would have also been really interesting to see her interact with Johnny at the end too...
---
My vendor sells everything for 99caps or less, regardless of what it is.  I just can't be greedy - and I like the feeling of getting a deal, so why not return the favor.   Sorry, on PS4.
---
What you don't want 5 chrisma, 2 perk cards, a considerable amount of luck, many hours of world hopping for a random event? =D
---
Hmm. Maybe I can't see the contents. I only see five pictures on Imgur's mobile site, last two tabs are missing.
---
Also, guys, there's no reason to downvote someone using their time and posting pictures for us.
---
Thanks for posting what you have; I still appreciate it even if I do point out something missing.
---
And the blind ban hammer
---
No idea. Works fine for be. Load of people have B2525 handmades right now that arnt dojng 2000+ damage a shot. Can‚Äôt show you the data mine for that either so that can‚Äôt be true either. All I can tell u is HTD stacks for me and everyone else. Clearly your game must be different
---
I usually target their generator or the more costly stuff to fix.
---
There‚Äôs film grain in this?
---
Because the point of a Pvp game mode is to PVP ..?
---
Haha yeah! It got it's 20th anniversary recently. They gave (are giving?) [Baal Wings](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo3/23459856/commemorate-20-years-of-diablo-ii-with-carbot-mrllamasc-and-new-in-game-wings) to Diablo 3 players to celebrate.
---
Legendary Perks is just something to grind for in our already overpowered characters. People on PTS are not speaking well of those perks either.  
---
EDIT: point is doing quests are the basis of a Fallout game so definitely they should be a priority,
---
The ATX would make money hand over fist if they put out a Fixer skin.
---
It could be fluorescent brown with a turd emoji on the side and it would still sell by the hundreds of thousands.
---
Maybe instead of nerfing bloodied they should buff other builds.........
---
You don't lose any rep for killing nameless faction NPCs. Super immersive.
---
Part of me hopes that with 76 having been brought to Steam, they'll take advantage of the Steam Workshop and allow player-made submissions to be monetized for a cut - or take a page from Warframe and have Steam Cosmetics which are purchasable with USD instead of Atoms (as trying to figure out how to pay out Atom purchases might be tricky).
---
I can dream, though.
---
So firstly, the less people there are, the easier the silo is. And second....you spent 90 minutes looking for a card? You spent more time looking for a piece of plastic than it takes for most people to launch two or three nukes.
---
I did silo once - and never again - hated every bit of it.  But the rest of the game is still fun.
---
Takes me literally less than 3 mins to lunch a nuke using popular methods. Look up.a guide on youtube, and look up the launch  code on google. You dont rlly need anything else to do tje thing, other than a good gun/armor so that the assaultrons/turrets dont tear u a new one.
---
I have not only played it, I reviewed it.
---
People, at least in the box, are starting to understand the dynamics, snd groups are now lots of fun and grind
---
I understand that, but when it‚Äôs painfully obvious I don‚Äôt care about the PVP and am just punching animals, it‚Äôs not that hard to just pass me by. I‚Äôll log off once I‚Äôve finished the SCORE challenge.
---
I wish Bethesda would make punji boards where they cannot hurt other players. I cannot stand the setup camps like those. I go in stealthfully if I don‚Äôt trust it. So I cannot be hurt by floor traps.
---
Exactly lol
---
ITT: Someone was rude to me at the store so I followed him home and burned down his house.
---
Man you're shit.
---
yes i dont have it either
---
Whew, exactly what I've been hoping for.
---
Awesome thankyou so much, i found ya and i've joined your world, happy to meet you at your CAMP if youd like
---
Yeah it's rough the first time, use one gun army in luck to cripple the heads on the Assaultrons. The worst is yet to come with multiple Assaultrons and gutsies respawning in the final room as you defend the launch specialist bots. Are you on PS4?

---
And if you kill one, the others will not care
---
Chinese stealth suit + Escape artist OR Power armor with heavy weapon is pretty all you require for solo.
---
Thanks dude for your quick response! Killed him and his friend didn‚Äôt even attack me! I guess that is the raider way! I got a Vampire‚Äôs Railway rifle (2*) exploding!
---
So you‚Äôre whining about the silo being too hard solo but won‚Äôt read anything or watch video guides or join a team because that would make it too easy? This post is confusing...
---
Ok this is good info, you and a few others have commented the same thing now so this seems like a separate but somewhat related issue.
---
I suspect that you do have the atoms... but as you say you can‚Äôt access them because of having purchased the game outside of the Bethesda launcher. 
---
I think Bethesda should resolve this by moving your balances over as it is not fair to have effectively lost them.
---
Raise a support ticket with them and perhaps reference this post for context so they can investigate.
---
They have major investors, which works out the same.  They need to make money for the return the investors are expecting.
---
If you creep my profile, you'll see that I'm not at all in favor of the way BGS is running the show, I've been pretty vocal about it.  I'm also realistic, and understand that they have to make a profit, with this financial model, since they're committed to it.
---
Can we get a glitch for raider quests, too, perhaps? Come on, Bethesda, if you're fucking up anything anyway, why not fuck up something that actually benefits players?
---
After all, this reputation non-content sucks major balls. No variety at fucking all. I'd even be happier with a "press LMB 300 times" challenge - it's on the same level of boring, but at least you could cheese it...
---
Hey there!  I don't have any turrets, only two water purifiers, and minimal lights.  All those really eat up budget.  After that, that prefabs take up the biggest chunk of my CAMP.  I've been selectively deleting and replacing things to get the biggest bang for my decorating buck over the past couple of days; which means losing some guard rails, floors, and elaborate roofing that requires extra wall pieces.
---
what console or whatever are you on, it looks like me lol
---
Just the thought of people that sell for normal prices is good, hope you have yourself a good day
---
You can drop the nuke anywhere to conclude the main campaign. But if you see a lot of high levels on the server, might as well go for Prime just for the full experience. If you nuke, they will come. You likely won‚Äôt be hurting for help.
---
There's not supposed to be film grain, probably a glitch
---
This especially makes sense considering one of the score challenges is always going to be nuclear winter related. So you have to log in to adventure mode in order to find out what you need to do in nuclear winter, quit to the main menu and then enter nuclear winter.
---
These developers are dumb.
---
I have a bit over 200 hours played and I am level 210. I also have only been playing long enough to experience one double exp weekend. I went from 120 to 200 this last weekend using lunch boxes, canned stew, well rested bonus, building team, egg head for more int, and unyielding gear. I know there are other exp bluffs on food but I didn't have the ingredients and didn't worry about it. 
---
You also get lots of legendaries and many events are guaranteed legendaries so you increase chances of great rolls.
---
Thanks I'll bear that in mind when placing one down.
---
How about piss off with your nerfs and help the community with more buffs to other builds.
---
actually, that's probably because their target is in combat. sneak multiplier doesn't trigger if your target is in combat.
---
&gt;All I can tell u is HTD stacks
---
it doesn't. are you saying angryturtle is wrong? but like you said it yourself, don't take our word for it. heal your rads and test it.
---
if I had to guess I'd say you tested it at low health and mistook the agility boost with HTD stacking. I literally just tested it, it. doesn't. stack.
---

100% agree a lot of the community hate to give them any money but would be the first to cry if they closed servers we should get something extra for the support  we give

I thought the helmet was available with a previous atom shop bundle/item ?

lol yeah it was a low lvl fight me being and and the 2 were 8-12 I had to get off shortly after the fight cuz I‚Äôm working for my relatives for money.

You can craft the nuka vaccine at a chemistry station. It will just craft whatever you originally named it.

Its just marketing. People want to buy shit if they k ow they‚Äôre running out of time.

Fair enough. It doesn‚Äôt stack. Have fun

There's a weird middle ground of Solo-Team player that I'm proud to belong to. You enjoy many benefits of team play - xp boost, perk card sharing, free travel between camps - but with none of the hassle of actually having to play as a fully fledged team.

FOMO makes people buy
---
Very welcome. Yeah, there's really no reason not to kill every raider or settler you come across unless you're really trying to roleplay- and even then, it's not unrealistic for a raider character to be savage enough to kill his comrades. There's even a loading screen that says the raiders will kill each other for a chance at moving up in the ranks.
---
Hahaha bugthesda strikes again!
---
Neat!
---
In addition to this most if not all devs don't even play the game themselves, they get told to do stuff and try to do something but without any real connection tot he game they will just keep putting out features where you see nobody actually tested it during design phase. Recent issues of that being the ammo converter and the 'neat' display of S.C.O.R.E. rewards in your crosshair in the middle of the screen.
---
Check out Rifle Gaming‚Äôs YouTube video on junkie‚Äôs builds. He goes into perks and everything in it.
---
Perhaps they fear me! One raider at the Crater said ‚Äú Whoa! I heard of you! You‚Äôve done everything to do in the wasteland you are a legend!‚Äù
---
MOIST!
---
I also believe the whitesprings nuka vender sells the all besides nuka cranberry.
---
To create a feeling of scarcity, so people are more inclined to impulse buy. Or maybe the UI for the shop just can't handle that much stuff
---
That would be really nice, they have to be able to push the player-made contents to consoles though, if they think it‚Äôs a viable way to generate more revenue. It feels to me that their creation team is quite lean and can only come up with so much content each week. If some external help can bring in more profits while keeping the users happy, why not?
---
sorry for the late reply was working, so the downside is that get annoying the PA talking? yeah I wish they had put on a bundle couse 1250 is a bit too much for a single item with no other purpose than beauty. if have a silent  version I gonna buy it to be honest is cool
---
Although it is good they fixed it so atoms no longer get misapplied, it looks like there is still some cleanup to do with atoms already being assigned wrongly.
---
You and others in the same predicament will have effectively lost those atoms until they move them across to your steam client.
---
Raise a ticket and get them to look into your case so they can investigate. Sounds like they need to apply the fix broadly to all affected though.
---
But does it loose synergy with revenant? The attractive thing about life saving armor, is that it triggers revenant which is a huge boost in damage. Or would revenant trigger immidietly as you hit 0 health?
---
Bloodied or Junkies for meta and everything else for casuals.
---
Plus, the only items worthy to buy are those going to be vaulted = automatically discounted. When I started I bought some cool items etc just to find out all the items, even packages just go on discount sooner or later lol.
---
:( why cant i just be lazy and press a button to repair them for some woooood
---
but alright thank you
---
Full set mixed random troubleshooter's armor 1\* other effects not important, could be wood just make a set, whatever you can get. Troubleshooters weapons would be nice.

I've traded with friends and people I met in game. If they have one you want ask them to craft it for you, usually they'll be happy with a trade or do it for free. It's basic farm ingredients.

A DLC 4x the size of the base game? For \~$20? Don't think so.

I don't know exactly how DE does it for Warframe on consoles insofar as giving users who make cosmetics their cut, but those cosmetics do end up on the console versions of WF, and instead of costing straight USD they cost Platinum (which is WF's in-game RMT currency).
---
Could just do something similar to that for 76.
---
Life-saving armor and this perk are mutually exclusive. The perk only works in power armor. So this isn‚Äôt relevant. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if this perk triggers revenant, I didn‚Äôt test that, but due to the way it behaves, I don‚Äôt think it would.
---
I literally don‚Äôt give a shit about Nuclear Winter. All I‚Äôm after is the score. So I‚Äôd appreciate it if all the level-140 players would consider that a level-9 player with NO ARMOR and NO WEAPONS might not be here for the PvP aspect. Unless you‚Äôre all that concerned with constantly raising your Overseer rank. This isn‚Äôt a dick-measuring contest.

The ban wave is already over. There are so many duped weapons from multiple different dupe methods since 2018 BGS wont ban you if you get one.
---
I googled it and nearly died. What the heck?! üò´üò≠ü§£
---
That sound amazing to me honest, I'd love that.
---
I actually completed it by doing this just south of Bolton Greens. I got 4 AI kills in one round, couldn't believe my luck.
---
Get two pieces of Acrobat armor (3rd star effect). Absolute fall damage immunity.
---
I go with a sledgehammer and a pa do it in 25 min if I  don't get a dc, why do you need to copy paste others build to do content is beyond my understanding.
---
Just don't be a bot, ez.
---
And when you already got all the loot you need within 2 minutes of spawning they're just a way to put a big target over your head.

An undeserved prize for Bethesda that in great part belongs to the community

Search a bit on this subredit. Everyday there is someone asking for Tips
---
Sure enough, the desktop version has them. They are only absent on the mobile Imgur.
---
What do you expect? They don't even play their own game
---
You may have paid for it but that 60 dollars is long used. So now they will keep adding more things to buy and keep the money going.
---
It should. The ammo is technically in your stash the whole time. It's placed there directly, just 'assigned' to the ammo factory.
---
No fix, have to replace your camp and save as many pieces as blueprints for easier rebuild.
---
Bought the fixer plan for 150 caps

It SAYS there‚Äôs a silent version now. But I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs bugged. I have it but haven‚Äôt tried testing the new silent version.

I kind of like the voice- it‚Äôs like a early warning radar, since a voice line goes off as soon as an enemy aggros to you (if you weren‚Äôt in combat already).

You must be new here welcome

I do feel bad...he saved my ass! I was walking around the Mire and decided to use a new weapon I just got a legendary broadsider. It‚Äôs not my build but thought it would be funny to try it. Shot it at 3 charred ghouls it missed 7 times even from point blank range! So here I am level 114 running from ghouls because health is low! Raiders were standing around this tree camp in the highway and took care of the ghouls while I hid behind a tree...lol. Although the ghouls killed 2 of the raiders. The legendary raider said to me, ‚ÄúThat was a close one‚Äù before I shot him in the face with my lever gun
---
You would have to upload it to Youtube and link it here as no direct uploads seem to be allowed.
---
I thought maining black powder weapons was a meme. Have you left the forest though???
---
First one is the hardest as it‚Äôs a learning experience, admittedly. But I wouldn‚Äôt throw in the towel. You can do it.
---
I didn't say using atoms wasn't. You also need to look at what the word 'literally' means as you're arguing semantics while proving my point.
---
I love those camps, I haven't seen a trapped one yet.
---
When you complete the scorched earth event you get some treasury notes which can be turned into gold bullion and I like killing the scorch queen so i might get it some day without only grinding treasury notes.
---
What is it?
---
i like it, I'm seriously thinking on going full pa+melee or pa+heavy gun if I buy the skin but I don't know nothing about this style of build and reactor aren't easy to come by for me at least.
---
Put your skirt back down we can all see your...
---
Don't focus of keeping higher level items. Focus on leveling up to 50
---
yo like WTF that is legit BULLSHIT
---
1? No.
---
50 copies? Maybe.
---
If they were banning for simple trades or possession, there wouldn't be any duped guns left around to trade, and a *lot* more people would have been banned. One of two things are happening with people who claimed to never dupe and yet got banned:
---
1) They're lieing. Shocking I know, but plenty of people were angry about being banned and want to rile up others, or attempt to garner sympathy for this "injustice".
---
2) They *didn't* dupe, but still tripped the automated system in some other way. A common thread I've started seeing is people *rapidly* switching servers. This would likely nail those who didn't dupe... but also tried server hopping a lot to attempt to nick the duped weapons of someone else.
---
TLDR: Don't worry about the potential of trading for a duped weapon. Duped weapons have been in circulation since shortly after the game released.
---
Idk if it actually was but this might have been me lmao! I did The Path to Enlightenment and Mothman got bugged up there so I leaped to get the Mothman's blessing and dragged him to the ground doing so - OP, are you on Xbox by chance??

I don't think there's film grain, but there is this weirder checkerboard effect for the ambient occlusion effects. It's very noticeable in darker conditions. Is that what you mean? Take some photos or videos if you can.

It‚Äôs little cuts like this that will fall the beast. That beast is addiction and the meal is me. Can‚Äôt fuckin wait for CP2077.

Keep food and water on you, talk to other players and just have fun and explore . If you have the game on Xbox feel free to add me and I can give you some free newbie gear and stuff to get you rolling

this is bullshit....classic buggedthesda

If you google Appalachian Thunder Pipe, an Urban Dictionary article is the first hit. It‚Äôs wildly inappropriate.
---
Atoms are hard to come by now, so I‚Äôm really careful about what bundles I get.  Do you have the red rocket garage and/or traincar?  
---
I like the cabin, but like a lot of those prefabs, it won‚Äôt snap to floors.  You need to adjust it if you intend to have it align with a base.  Camp fire is nice for the well rested bonus
---
Hes on the new mothman one. I heard it had a good cpu.
---
Must have. I only got caught once at a trap base, but it won't happen again. And of there is a stash box outside, I think twice.
---
You know my camp isn't a trap...there are like 10 stash boxes, and everything is wide open.
---
You are lucky, i‚Äôve only found people selling it for  8-15 thousand.
---
I think a lot of people are starting to figure out that even game companies run under a capitalist system, but they treat it as if they are polluting the air or water. Marketing has always been a thing and that subliminal ad thing in movies is still around as they make sure the label of a brand is facing out.
---
The trick is to not care. Who cares if Bethesda shows me the atom shop when I log in? There are way more issues to care about than marketing in a video game.
---
90% of the things you trade is duped
---
Oh I will! I wanted to wait until I NEED that currency. Also. I can‚Äôt be bothered with the weight of the repair and scrap kits. They are useless to me.
---
Yes just not the SBQ
---
The ironic part is that it will never actually get better as long as people stay. They legitimately dont care about your complaints as long as the money flows.
---
Wow! Thats a heck of a tip, I'm one who stays away from my C.A.M.P. for long periods of time so this is a heck of a time saver
---
Follow around low level players. They get downed all the time
---
What is RN?
---
None. Kill him and take the loot. LoL. I have done that several times now and all are happy with me in the wasteland still.
---
The event goes to mid September I believe.  There should be plenty of time to level up as long as you do the weekly challenges and as many of the dailies. 
---
I don‚Äôt think any of the projections are accurate.  So many people will get to 100 by the end of August, if not before
---
Hahah that's hilarious. It's even better that they were so mad they actually messaged you to let you know just how effective your destruction was.
---
Ya not worth the hassle, easier to just grind out 30k exp to get +300 SCORE from the repeatable quest.
---
I now realise this bug seems a lot more common than I knew (not that shocking lol). I personally had him stuck in the air like that only once so I'd never seen it happen before. Regardless, great shot!
---
Without glitching through walls or speedrunning, you can complete alone easily a silo run in 10 -15 min. If you take 90 min just to find a keycard.... well, better uninstall the game üòÇ
---
At launch, it didn't generate an ounce of power.
---
Looks like Bethesda is even categorizing it to trick people too
---
here, might as well show you this, too. decided to test it myself. HTD does not stack.

My current gear is solid for humanoid mobs, I can 2 hit kill lvl 70 scorch but my best gun for bullet sponges is my railway rifle (non legendary/no mods) and I'd feel more comfortable walking in with something with more bite.

I have my survival tent set up to the east of Welch on a hill near a tent that spawns random encounters. I have it there because the rate outfit trader spawns there. I‚Äôve ran across this encounter a handful of times there. Maybe it‚Äôs a lot more rare than I know of. I‚Äôll try to get pictures the next time.
---
That is quite clever....I love it!
---
What's your build right now?
---
I really like when players do come with broken weapons, but decide to use them only after certain time passes, and only after Queen regenerates. It's polite and decent to everyone there. I like to have that "guarantee" that time won't expire, and event will finish on time. 
---
There aren't obvious rules set how to behave, especially for newer players, and if someone that got their hands on overpowered and broken weapon, let's loose and unintentionally ruins experience for others.
---
There are youtube clips with what to look for when crafting/buying/looting, and people often go that easy way, without considering how it affects others.
---
Ok thank you
---
That's the Raider's way
---
I think only one missing the definition of the word here is you seeing how you argue with everyone who actually knows what it means over it. But I'll clarify since it seems like you only heard of dictionaries and never actually held one... For it to be pay to win it'd need to provide some unfair advantage over other players. It'd require some items that actually provide one and there are none. So this is not LITERALLY pay to win. It's not even figuratively pay to win. It's not any kind of pay to win because you aren't winning anything over anyone by getting cosmetic items that provide no winning advantages.
---
The hostility wasn't needed, maybe try a better approach? 
---
A person I recently traded with this morning got a duped BE gat plas and wasnt banned. A friend hasnt been banned yet for duping and getting duped weapons. So I guess your friends were just unlucky. 
---
But its seemed like the ban wave has near halted since Todd put on his blindfold and started firing the ban shotgun in the general direction of his targets
---
Only 95 for me today. But it's the midwest, so humidity is a real bastard.
---
I don't understand the can't wait for warm weather people. I can't wait for a high in the 50s again.
---
Supposedly you should be at rank 45 right now to be on track to complete it. They're suppose to have a double dailies score weekend this weekend. So plenty of catch-up can be done for those behind.
---
I spent a good 10 minutes trying to get enemies to attack the Crater settlement.  Had a radscorpion running amuck and they seemed like they could care less lol.  Immersion breaking
---
Spoiler: They will be, that's how seasons have worked on every other game, do some challenge get points.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre trolling or if you have one brain cell. Imagine complaining about getting killed in a pvp game...
---
Lol yes i also use heavy guns for the really hairy situations it makes up for how slow it is to reload the bp weapons.

I think you mean Fallout 77
---
Must have missed you. Head on back.
---
yea i'm gonna have to agree.

NW can fuck right off.

Lol stay buttmad then

I'm pretty sure it prevents airborne disease? I swear I remember reading that everytime I scrolled through it in my inventory

Nice gun!

Lame marketing department decisions.
---
Lol. And he‚Äôs never wrong?  I‚Äôd do a little research. Oh and to quote your reasoning. Turtle doesn‚Äôt datamine. Just tests. So it can‚Äôt be trusted. Oh and one final little thing. Bethesda fox and break things constantly. How olds the video?  U need to get out more. üòò
---
Nea screw that... Power armour like the Space Marine from 40k :P
---
I play mele and don‚Äôt have this issue. SB‚Äôs will land but only when there is room.  Use shotgun with enforcer perk if you need to cripple- doesn‚Äôt work on Queen.

Currently doing that atm, going to server hop until i find some

Currently playing on a fucked internet connection and it's fine on 10mbps, so you'll be good.

Now you go make Ulu-Mulu

Yeah I was wondering if they were I got about 20 levels over double XP weekend so caught up a lot on the 100 score for every 10k XP challenge I'm thinking that wasn't taken into account in the projections
---
You're just rolling in atomic points, shiettt.
---
You have to select the tent skin in the atom shop to equip it.
---
Why would he not play if he enjoys doing it?
---
Medic backpack and medic survival tent are 2 diff items.
---
That survival tent is from months ago and is selected in atom shop.
---
Backpack is applied at workbenches
---
Awesome I guess I should leave some of my weeklies for the weekend then
---
Same. Hit level 50 earlier.
---
why would buying a backpack skin make your tent change
---
Haha no, I'm on PC and Mothman didn't get hung there, he spawned then dropped. This all just happened at the exact right moment
---
check the title.

Fallout76 2020-07-21 18-33-35-95

you should take your own advice and test it yourself instead of doubling down on bad info.
---
Oh I was hoping it would give chicken eggs, but I‚Äôll take fertilizer!
---
Better for the "board", but that's replaced now that we have the Season S.C.O.R.E. system. I wish Bethesda would grow-up, realize that being a private company they can still make the product they want to make, and focus on high quality instead of garbage like the big kids out there. That's why we loved the old Bethesda.
---
tru tru tru! i gotta haul ass üò≠
---
You posted one bundle and nothing else. Be more accurate next time.
---
I‚Äôm gonna gun you down because there‚Äôs been plenty of times where I‚Äôve under estimated a bush wookie or ‚Äúonly SCORE‚Äù player only to get my ass murked by them and/or their squad. If your so concerned with getting that 250 score, drop in a super isolated area and get a weapon to kill the creatures faster. There‚Äôs plenty of creatures on the outskits of monogah power plant and Bolton greens.
---
If you booswookie and wait a mob to spawn, it would be easy for you to complete the daily. But asking not to be killed in a Pvp mode.... üôÉ
---
I'm sorry mate but I still don't believe you. I'm also around your level and it just seems too sketchy to me.
---
It's just my opinion and you don't need to prove anything anyway.
---
Now you wait as the season is only 3 weeks through
---
Could've waited, but I won't judge
---
They all should, all I know is that I honestly love having 2 Legendary pieces that reduce fall damage. I can confirm that it's 100% because I jumped from the very top of the Monorail Elevator and free fell for 4-5 seconds straight without even a scratch. üëç
---
now you're done. you finished the event. take a break, do something else, whatever you want.
---
So you don't understand it?
---
This post is ridiculous.

You know it‚Äôs funny I never had by Brahmin destroyed until Game Pass came around, now every lowbie comes through and bops it right away..üôÅ
---
Is that the outcast paintjob on your ultracite?
---
Morons bad at video games have trouble with this easy challenge. Got it done in one round.

Pretty sure you misunderstood the point of this post.
---
You only get 1 daily per zone per day. And you have to visit each zone for them to show up.
---
Full inventory? Check your inventory
---
Thanks I knew it was posted before but I guess I wasn't getting my wording right when I searched for it
---
Ok i might do that
---
Always found it amazing how there isn't a single skin for any of the weapons I main in this game.   &gt;   .&lt;
---
Trust me, I have no desire to kill any of you people. There‚Äôs no SCORE reward for that. üòò
---
It's busier than the other 3 corners of the map.
---
Ok. You don‚Äôt listen do you. 50 levels with full HTD and no sneak perk. Not 3 seconds in WS. And what u actually said showed it stacked. As I took it off I cane out of caution. Sent. Cav. Fall damage etc. All stack. Why do Y oh have it in your mind that HTD doesn‚Äôt?  And how do I have 20 agility with no Uny armour?  Give your head a wobble
---
Don't drink Vintage Nukashine. Seriously.
---
First time is hard to go through silo. Once you know which door you can glitch through, then it takes 5 mins. Literally just the wait for the chief officers to get the launch prep done. 
---
Nobody goes through the silo like it‚Äôs suppose to be, just look up some photo mode glitches and it‚Äôll be a life/time saver.
---
I suppose it‚Äôs clunky. I like it. It‚Äôs silly.
---
You wait
---
Honestly I think there's so much luck involved. I did it today, and had 5 creatures before the fire moved. Last time it took 3 rounds.
---
But it is hard to sacrifice rare free time for nw.
---
Imagine complaining about other people voicing their opinion on Reddit.
---
Same. Then again I don‚Äôt find many trap camps either.
---
I currently have ONLY the chest paint on my excavator.  
---
Democracy cannot be silenced :C
---
Blocked
---
What system?
---
You can try moving your camp box, that helps
---
Both
---
Wow impressive! I have a clip of me saving Mothman from his suspension but unfortunately most everyone already left the area so I might have been the only one to get his blessing
---
Stop fighting her too far south.
---
Good luck young tadpole
---
Yeah but no HW perks until 30+ so not much point.
---
Just go melee until you hit 30ish and can start putting perks into it.
---
Yea they could just convert the atom value to currency and share part of the profit with creators. If someone can come up with a few nice skins for the fixer, handmade or even the DCG, you bet they‚Äôll make a quick fortune given how high the demand is.
---
Have you tried to Keep moving both the location and the direction of your camp Beacon in the build Menu After you place your camp? - this will change the spawn points.  I have been able to solve all of my camp spawn issues with this
---
Your brahmin is safe with me sir.
---
Same area I did it in. Actually got 5 in the first run. A tip that worked for me is that VATS would lock onto a monster before I got the red marker. That's how I found my 5th one!
---
I dunno if it helps, but I used to be a guild leader on a WoW private server. People would sometimes randomly lose legendary gear pieces and when you would contact support their answer every time was that without photo proof they cannot do anything.
---
Well I'd raise hell in the support channel, not shutting up about the issue when a guild member of mine would lose a legendary item and within a few days of being lied to finally someone would tell me they are looking into it and within another week they would get it back.
---
It sucks they are dealing with the same quality level as a WoW private server from Bethesda but being virulent pays off sometimes.
---
Addiction is a strong word to use I think.
---
Angry turtle made a video showing that the armor actually need to be matching in type but can be of different weights(light,heavy...)
---
‚ÄúYour opinion‚Äù is stupid and nobody respects it.
---
I tried, but nothing changed.
---
People one shot legendary enemies as it is, making more builds do it will mean no one gets legendaries.
---
I had 5000 atoms kicking around, just from fallout first and being very picky with my buying. What better use? I don't mind a little grind but beth overdoes it. Kill 5 creatures in NW? 
---
The planetarium light is shitty by the way. Blurry purple dim projections. Figures
---
I go to the atomic Shop and there‚Äôs no way to equip that item
---
dude, I just posted video proof it doesn't stack. you're fighting a losing battle here. you've suffering from a serious case of confirmation bias.
---
I removed the pieces one by one and it had no effect on the sneak bracket up until the last one. the video I posted literally proves HTD doesn't stack, otherwise the bracket would've moved as I unequipped the pieces.
---
&gt;Sent. Cav. Fall damage etc. All stack. Why do Y oh have it in your mind that HTD doesn‚Äôt?
---
the dataminers asked the same question. supposedly it's a bug.
---
&gt;And how do I have 20 agility with no Uny armour?
---
I have 13 agility. 4 from bird bones and 3 from the shielded harness. totaling 20.
---
I wish you could just put a spawn point where you want it.  I just rebuilt mine and found that 2 times I have spawn into things, once a wall and once my generator.  
---
I didn't know about the moving of the CAMP box.  That's helpful perhaps.
---
Did you try any of the precautions posted on here? Log off during reset. Go into adventure before and after. Don‚Äôt go into nw or the atomic shop before logging into adventure. Etc etc.
---
Lmao whew, look at that. The response I was expecting. Like you, I really don‚Äôt care too much for the mode, but I do like the rewards. I would love the welding mask and large supply crate stash box. Or the centurion helmet. 
---
But, even though I very, very rarely play the mode, I don‚Äôt go to Reddit crying because somebody that‚Äôs playing the game right was playing the game right. It‚Äôd almost be like a NW coming to Reddit crying because of how restricted PvP is in Adventure.
---
Definitely this. They haven‚Äôt yet figured out how online impulse purchase works in a RNG based game.
---
Okay. Then move on.
---
Me. I played from launch to about level 70 &amp; stopped. Picked it up again at the first of the year, not wanting to buy new games &amp; then covid happened &amp; its became a part of my daily routine really. I've jumped 152 levels to 222 &amp; if nothing else I do dailies to get 50 scrip then exchange the 150 scrip worth of legendaries &amp; immediately roll trying to get a couple pieces of SS armor I have yet to obtain &amp; continue to chase after a bloodied bear arm. Can't say it's immensely fun at this point. Not much left enticing to buy w gold bullion. Legendary run is underwhelming.
---
GAAHHH; that durned greenhouse is only available as part of a bundle :(
---
Yeah I was feeling the exact same way. Then a dooped a few things, boom, problem solved üòÇ
---
Because I have a buddy that wanted someone to play with and I wanted to see first-hand if it was still digital cancer with the addition of things it should have had at launch(NPCs, proper quests, et-al).
---
Here's my tip for you as a new player go here and plan out a build it will save you a headache later on: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Also remember you don't have to pick a Perk Card associated with the Special stat you increased when you Level up you can for example Increase your Strength but pick a Luck Perk Card.
---
It doesn't work always for me, but for some people it does.
---
You‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre two different tents but when I look in the atomic shop and I bought the skin it shows you that is supposed to pop up as the medic tent so what are you saying because I could find no videos on this what do I need to do
---
You‚Äôre totally right. My post was too harsh. Who am I to complain?
---
FOMO drives sales. If it didn‚Äôt, they wouldn‚Äôt do it.
---
Same, the past few days i have been joining public event teams and fighting enemies 20 to 30 levels above my current because of it.  Sure I get clapped from time to time, but I bet those level 250+ guys get a kick out of seeing a level 32 bashing enemies skulls in with a power fist lol.  And the rewards are pretty sweet to boot.
---
This ^ Most of the people who got banned mass duped weapons and items. The people I know had like 5+ of the same weapon sitting in there inventory‚Äôs
---
everything related to story or the world will always be free.
---
Maybe open a ticket directed at the right people  vs making yet another post about this?
---
Man, the handful of plants I keep at my camp in addition to the metric ton of meat I never get around to eating ensures that I'm always overstocked with thousands of fertilizer.
---
I really would have preferred if it just had  loose chicken that would wander around it adding character to my camp.
---
And it doesn't even provide a meager egg item to eat or throw like a Grenade?
---
I bomb players camps all day. It's fantastic and fun.
---
Sorry some people are so rude.
---
Tricky one, I like both. I think I still sway more towards the green thumb bundle as personally I've not found use for the log cabin but really like using the greenhouse. The fire pit is nice and useful for rested bonus but it could be a bit deeper, it doesn't really sink into the floor so looks really odd if it's not on a flat surface. I'd honestly say coin toss.
---
Lol are you saying you got what you wanted or Todd took care of your habit forcefully?
---
You explained that so nicely. I agree.
---
When they say an image is worth a thousand words...Well in fallout 76 images are worth shit and you better learn to read what you're paying for.
---
A person of culture, I see.
---
No they did not. Show me your camp and I'll introduce you to 4th of July Fireworks.
---
Yeah in hindsight it‚Äôs a bit strong. Still some of the same underlying tendencies though. I know it‚Äôs wrong but I keep doing it. Like crack lol.
---
Nah, I think I‚Äôll stick around and watch how this shitshow goes down
---
You're on the edge of problems much bigger than fallout 76 right now buddy
---
Well I didn‚Äôt know about the atomic shop thing, but I followed all the others. I didn‚Äôt even log on until I got home from work at 5:30 pm.
---
....
---
Or, you know, if you want to be cool and share, invest the special?
---
Are you using the power armor to get through the laser grid?  I tried it on PS4 but I couldn‚Äôt get that to work
---
Catch him left that loser in dust at week end see ya at the finish line lol
---
If you mean XP, sure, yeah but it's still half way through the ranks, which is what I was celebrating Mr Magoo.
---
You can, when it is broken you hit one button and repair it for some materials.  Before it is broken (just damaged) you can store it and then place it again and it puts it back to full condition at no cost.  I chose the latter when my decon shower was almost shot from a camp attack by baddies, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the materials to repair that thing!
---
I always assumed that HTD only applied to entering crouch rather than while you were sneaking
---
Edit to the post incoming, hopefully it‚Äôll clear things up
---
Yeah fair point. Just the way the capitalist shitshow runs. Expect the worst and you won't be disappointed I guess.
---
We all wish we lived in your fantasy world üåé

Radchicken egg throwable is an item I never thought about, but it is now absolutely essential that this makes its way into the game asap.

Go us!

Was hoping we would get a junkyard PA set that would have the helmet glass cracked so we see our eyes or something. That would be cool but the body physics won't allow that's unless they just use a static eye

Bruh. Maybe because people don't wont to spend money on a virtual item.

I could handle the bugs if they actually brought the sort of simple content people have been begging for.

Whisper to an eagle and a moth shows up to save you from Saruman.

Its just the fact that the poverty line in the United states (I made the error in assuming you were US already so I'm going to run with it and cross my fingers) still spends hundreds of dollars per month on things like entertainment via video game consoles internet television the best new phone plans, etc.

Whatever man, you're a moron. I don't have time for your stupidity.
---
How is it a fantasy world? How do you not have an extra 10 bucks a month
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for the powered doors to be the correct way around!
---
Can confirm, it‚Äôs standalone. Pretty easy to set up how you like though.
---
Astrid looks inedible
---
no, it affects the same variable as the sneak perk, I think. or, at the very least, functions in a very similar manner. kinda like escape artist and muffled.
---
I was lucky to knock out 4 in one match.  Ran across a 50 cal and doing the Bush Wookie dance I killed 3 before third circle and tagged and I guess got credit for a Grafton monster after that.  Next match easily knocked out one more before being taken out.  Honestly its' not that difficult. If you want to complain, complain about the 'kill a player'  That's a true FU to Bethesda.
---
You are one nice juicy fat cash cow, aren‚Äôt you?
---
Watch that you dont cut yourself around this edgelord
---
Now this is Fallout.
---
Gotta say not too impressed with the update this time, I like the idea of a big game camp bundle but this just feels lacking in...something. I was thinking more things based on the Black Bear hunting lodge, maybe a better weapons rack and an actual hunting trophy (Vault boy with hunting rifle).
---
That‚Äôs almost worse haha. Think about all the players who DO care about PVP and you‚Äôre essentially ruining the game for them by being a poor teammate and just in it for the score points and then quit.
---
I‚Äôve wanted this since beta. Or at the very least instanced apartments in Watoga or an instanced room at the Whitespring
---
I‚Äôm ahead of it going into week 3. I get most of my score from dailies/weeklies but I guarantee I‚Äôm getting at least 1/3 of my score just from the xp weekly quest
---
I do but a lot do not,  don't be so pretentious its a bad look
---
Everyone I‚Äôve talked to that had this happen before hasn‚Äôt had their ticket answered or had their lost score returned is why
---
Both, lol! About the only thing I was actively grinding was formula q, and that was a pain in the ass. The rest was the same set of habitual\addicted, (I don't know if chores is the right word), grind you mentioned. It's not that I didn't like it but sometimes I would question why I was doing it. I think the doop was just too enticing to pass up, it's not like I had trouble killing anything in the game with the gear I had but wow, I fully understand why some of those weapons are so sought after. Crazy fun, but sadly short lived
---
They've played longer, but they might be more event /xp driven. 
---
When I started my buddy surpassed me because he was going crazy with events and quests, while I was spending much more time building my CAMP, exploring every inch of each place I visited, and looking for rare collectibes!
---
However before the legendary run I was at level 105 or so.... I'm now level 171 because I've switched to just grinding out XP by constantly doing events, one after another non stop till I have to drop off a bunch of scrap and junk legendaries
---
Oh yea ofcourse but you made it sound like she drop the plan too
---
I don't have a lot of experience with developing games, but I do have a few friends in the field, and whenever I complain to them about bethesda "never fixing bugs," they laugh and say something along the lines of: "If developers aren't actively fixing bugs, there must be some internal reason for it, either they don't have enough manpower, or they're focusing more on developing other parts of the game, or they're just incompetent." It's not that bethesda's unaware that these bugs exist. I'm sure they're getting piles of tickets and complaints every day, but if they aren't fixing bugs, there's probably a reason for it, and I sincerely doubt that a "checklist" of bug fixes is a thing that exists both for bethesda devs, and honestly devs in general.
---
The silo launch prep takes 6 mins.....yet u finish in 3......
---
Okay. The Zealot Gatling Laser I use only for SBQ
---
Looks like shit imo.
---
If they could just get the events and dailys to work properly that be half the battle. 
---
Today's list
---
 Mr messenger pathing is terrible get stuck and bugs out nearly every time.
---
It's a trap scotch beast can be any where but where it supposed to be.
---
Breach and clear had no ore in containers
---
Various daily quest givers stuck in loop and you can't progress quest. 
---
Either to many enemies or non at all various events.
---
Lag in radiation rumble and line in sand especially if the turret is repaired.
---
Fly swatter no vertabot usually under map
---
Them just what had today lol
---
As stupid as the perks sound I suggest getting the audio cue perks in perception for bobbleheads and magazines, If you are at the point where you have spare points to throw around.  Turn them on while you are running around the map and you will find tons in places where you had just been running past them before. Watoga has a bunch of spawns so it's a great spot for farming.
---
After using those perks a while you will figure out where you need to go and look without having the perks equipped anymore.  A good Watoga run will get you several bobble heads and half a dozen or more magazines usually.
---
Unless someone like me came through there already lol.
---
Kill it
---
The house at the lighthouse near vault 76 has a level 0 upstairs
---
Edit:Landview lighthouse couldn‚Äôt remember the name
---
Prior to the double XP weekend, I was gobbling up B&amp;C events whenever they happened (love all that iron and lead ore!).  Easily a dozen times in the last three weeks, and had no events with empty containers.  Since the x2 weekend, it's only popped up twice (on separate days), and both times all the containers (even the ones needing an unlock key) were empty of ore and other junk items.  
---
If it isn't a bug, then SOMETHING has changed.
---
If u in xbox...I'll run w u....I enjoy killing g while helping
---
I didn't even know it was a PvP event until just before Wastelanders dropped.  
---
Never seen another player in there since beta.
---
Intriguing idea. I agree they need non-1st members (and 1st members) logging in for their metrics. I don't think the already present systems of grinding for constantly available (caps, bullion, scrip) currencies matters with the cap. If I still can hold onto this legendary armor and scrap it in 7 years for the same amount, I'll just log in Saturday, and if I reach my cap, I'll wait until next weekend.
---
Instead, I think they found the value of Seasons, and with a unique, limited time only, grind fest of FOMO, they have their hook, line and sinker all in one. Now they can remove their artificial timers and gates because they have the masses logging in so they don't miss out on these limited times events. What they really need to do is create a repeatable 101th S.C.O.R.E. board-game spot that rewards bullion, Atoms or scrip, or a random chance at all or some of each.
---
That would encourage those same grinders to continue logging in, and maybe buy out the event early so they can get bonus bullion or scrip.
---
Or Billings Homestead.
---
If I have to rebuild my camp one more time because some random flore tile ends up somewhere I didn't like but becomes permanently stuck at the final stage of decorating I'm going to loose my sheet.
---
And my camp build is like a 3 day project that im constantly having to rebuild because I have crippling OCD and the simple items needing adjusting refuse to budge, and all attempts to fix it just make everything permanently worse.
---
I always use abbie's bunker. but there probably are better options.
---
It's was put there for the alcohol quest
---
Fast travel to the flooded tracks in cranberry bog, there's a shack when you spawn in
---
It so rarely drops anymore, who even asked for this. Also, how is it different? It looks the exact same except for the minor detailing on the stock.
---
I'm a bloodied stealth build so I can't get her attention too much because losing it gets annoying and I don't tank hits
---
Getting a player kill is less time consuming than finding creatures on that map. I find tons when I don‚Äôt need them for the challenge and then they‚Äôre all extinct when I do. Fuckers
---
Bye, won't be missed
---
If you aren‚Äôt tagging legendaries, that‚Äôs your problem. Sounds like your build isn‚Äôt very good.
---
Here here! Release the Gourmand Recipes!
---
Just because I am a mutant cannibal clown cultist doesn't mean I am an uncivilized mutant cannibal clown cultist! I want hot meals too!
---
And drink recipes for the blood drinkers!
---
Im notntrying to be. Im being honest. I dont make tons of money a month. I pass things up in the atom shop all the time. Im just saying if you really want something from the atom store a spare 10 should not be that hard to come by.
---
Someone complaining about not being able to afford an item and someone not having the financial means to buy an item are two different things. (Which I'm sure you'll realize once you graduate middle school) I might have a spare couple of bucks a month to spend on shit, but if you think i'm going to spend $12.50 on a fucking power armor skin, you're dreaming. Doesn't mean I'm not gonna complain about it tho. And if that upsets you for some questionable reason, shove it up your ass.
---
It's an interesting concept. But all the potential issues that could happen w/resetting quest stages in Fallout 4 and the idea of Bethesda trying to do it for an entire *character* scares the hell out of me.
---
Idk, I don't pay attention to what builds exist. So custom? I'm pretty happy with how she plays.
---
My special ranks are fairly even across the board, charisma is my only low. Most are 9. 
---
Focused on non automatic rifles, armor penetration, non-power armor buffs, AP and dodge bonuses and VATs (sort of dealt good vats so I went with it)
---
If you want specifics I'll try to remember later tonight. I'm working late today. 
---
My problem is that I've only recently started acquiring any quality legendaries this past month. Most of my gear is the same as I was using last spring. I haven't even found a shotgun that beats my lvl 45 yet lol
---
just 250 dont play it.
---
I do take enemies but dont kill them unlike other people with there bloodied builds.
---
Would be nice, wouldn't it?
---
Not really man. Im active duty and contrary to popular belief we not rolling in the dough ü§£
---
I can believe that it has gotten worse.  I have played sense B.E.T.A. and I have done my fair share of trouble shooting  camp issues.  What happened today is something that I had never encountered before.  Many of the people responding here pretty obviously haven't encountered it either because they are responding by telling me about fixes that could not possibly work in the situation that I described in my post.
---
üòÇ
---
I know how that feels. I try not to sprint because then I aggro everything then I'm dead so I have to walk over to her head then everyone else shoots from far and makes her run over too so getting hits in is annoying
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ just speaking facts
---
Players with crappy vendors. Stock that thing up or turn it off.
---
I have always used this. When you fast travel there you will spawn very close to the 0 level terminal (and a lv1 locked safe, if i remember the lock level correctly) which is located at the centre of the raider camp. There is also 3 low level stingwings for some acid while you are there.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bleeding\_Kate%27s\_Grindhouse](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bleeding_Kate%27s_Grindhouse)
---
Psst, last time around it didn't have the player-restriction on it, so you could build it in other peoples camps / people who purchased it could build it in yours.
---
Nah dude, you're an asshole and you need to realize the world is bigger than you. No one should be forced to pay a monthly fee just to be able to aquire items in a full price game.
---
People like you are why the gaming industry is becoming a massive mess.
---
I mean... if your gonna do something the hard way and just wing it, dont expect it to be easy.
---
My first silo took about an hour, now its pretty easy to stay under 20 minutes without having to cheese it. Ive done it with just about every build, even with an I/E/25 10mm pistol and my 15 charisma support character aka a food build. 
---
Troubleshooters and a strong build help but arent nessecary.
---
With lockpick 3 you can bypass a couple sections and with hacker 3 you can shut off all the turrets for each section fairly easy.
---
Really once you've done the silo a couple times it gets pretty stupid easy.
---
So take a breather and try again someday if you want, because it gets way easier after the first.
---
Omg, why is anybody still playing this dead game, hackers can just walk up and steal all your stuff!!!  
---
Edit - hahaha, dude, you had to inbox rant me? Really? Are you new to Reddit? Do I really need to out /s on a post you fucking simp? Get out of my inbox you freak.
---
Release your anger...
---
\*bullion
---
I dont. I'm fallout 1st subscriber and have no issues with it. I'm just advocating for the other side. Not everything needs to be monetized though. By doing that it strips content from the game and lock it behind a paywall
---
I hate when they do that shit. Like during Fahnacht, you could only get the frog mask in the bundle. Lame...
---
Well I respect your honesty. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go duping though. I refer to it as chores as in gotta take out the trash, walk the dog, clean the house and oh get my fallout dailies lol.
---
Charleston Fire Department, a storage closet in the same room as the weapon and armor workbenches.  Plus you can get the lead from the weight room while you're there.
---
One more update for everyone on this, we have now determined the number of players affected and the amount of Atoms that each of those players was missing, which means we're able to begin granting you the number of Atoms you missed out on due to the bug starting tomorrow.
---
If you were affected, please keep an eye on the email address for your account over the next couple of days for a message stating that your missing Atoms have been restored. 
---
More info here in the forums: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/420361/
---
I speak for all of us 250+ : we love watching you run in with any melee or unarmed weapon. Sometimes we even make a post about it :)
---
The challenge can also be completed with crops you have growing at your own camp.
---
I would join you!
---
That's a no brainer then,I'll get on that asap. Wild that I've never sent that before in almost 300 hours of play and a fair amount of shopping in those hours
---
Just no
---
I just go to a silo and hack the first terminal
---
... did you read my post? My title? I‚Äôm not sure what point you‚Äôre trying to make.
---
Lol me too, like a madman I do my best not to use up too much psycho while crafting psychobuff just so that someday I will be able to make psychotats.
---
Honestly I feel like what we have is enough for now. It's kinda obnoxious to build houses that look decent from the outside without sticking with a preset theme, (Like the contemporary bundle's porches, or some other shit) and between shack wood, blue wood, bricks, white metal, black metal, and red barn exteriors, idk what else there really is to ask for. Maybe log cabin walls? That'd be kinda dope.
---
There are a lot of large guilds and communal groups out there that feel the 24 player limit is a bit low and have been lobbying for an increased limit. 
---
I bet they would not be happy about a player count reduction.
---
Finally
---
Gotcha
---
I hear the terminal at the Poseidon Energy Plant by Charleston Station that's within the workshop bounds is always locked and auto relocks itself after being hacked.
---
Hes like me but he directs it at people instead of Bethesda, and he never sticks around to defend himself he just drive by insults everyone, gets downvotes, and then repeats the next day. You're better off just not responding to him in general.
---
I bought this one. First skin i have seen for the ultra PA. I like it and think it is worthwhile to me. Plus i can add it to all the other t series as well
---
The regular Rolling Metal Door and the powered doors are in the same tab. I'm guessing it's because they *are* entire walls that happen to contain a pre-built door, as opposed to the regular doors that snap into a door frame wall.
---
I agree but there are tons of free content im just saying every single major online game has cosmetics for sale. Games as a service is becoming a thing ü§£
---
It was closed prior to wastelanders. Not sure when it'll be reopened.
---
Vault 94's inaccessible atm. If they bring back vault raids, it might open up again. Have to see.
---
I hate when my pets get worn out too.
---
Not sure what you are even talking about, your last comment doesn‚Äôt make sense......
---
Im not even talking about 1st man. Im talking in general and whether you likenit or not games a s a service is becoming a thing.
---
What's a good casual build?
---
Lvl 500 isn't that much considering the game is about 1,5 years old by now and that there were some XP exploits shortly after launch
---
They one shot the enemy before anyone can even tag it, that is my issue.
---
I always wait for feed the people to pop up and then go into the hidden commie base underneath. It's a pretty cool location, gives me an excuse to bother getting canned meat stew, and has a level 1 terminal right as you enter it.
---
Want the halloween items so bad!  99% of my time in game is spent mercilessly trying to build the perfect silent hill spooky camp.
---
Exactly!
---
I'm not a game developer, but as an engineer identifying problems and issues in a clearly defined manner does streamline the process, and allows efforts moving forward to be able to diagnose and increase team awareness so when changes to form, fit or function are going to be made, any issues that arise can have predictable impact. If issues do arise, if they're similar to previous bugs or problems, the fix is usually similar to.
---
They may not have a running list, but if the CMs are really "passing this on to the team" every time our community members go above and beyond with the latest list, I can only imagine how draining it must be as the "team" to hear the same issues brought up again and again. Having them all out there will hopefully add to our community, and would probably reassure those frustrated with any given bug.
---
The one response if got just said they have now way of helping return score.
---
I could have sworn I paid for this bundle already but never could find where the succulants were.
---
Sounds like you answered your own question and agree.
---
I traded on the forums that whole weekend, did 20+ trades if not more and have countless new weapons. I didn't get any suspensions or emails etc.
---
Lol cry all you want. Every single major online game has cosmetics for sale. I dont understand why you guys thinking frying bethesda is going to stop them from trying to get their bread
---
Pretty sure the fish lamp and topiary were early early atom items from like december 2018, I cant recall ever seeing the fish lamp since I originally got it. Thanksgiving display will for sure be coming around november along with the other displays I imagine.
---
[Looks like it came back sept 2019 as well](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4WVF3eXgXcV9rjGqeJL5Cn/atomic-shop-patch-13-items-and-sales-september-10)
---
Or forgetting to look down. Make sure you bring a good flashlight to the fight! Coloured lights on power armour seem gauche, but some colours really help distinguish mobs and terrain details... like fissures edges.
---
What did I miss?
---
When I first started reading this post, I automatically thought, the op was an a hole. But once I finished reading, he does have a valid point. Maybe the way he worded it was a little ‚Äòharsh‚Äô , but it‚Äôs true. You can‚Äôt get everything for free. And $10? Is just that, $10. Poverty? Someone brought that up. If someone is affected by poverty, then they probably aren‚Äôt playing this game, let alone any game. When I think of poverty, I think of someone that is barely getting by. And most likely, doesn‚Äôt own an Xbox, PS4 or computer. I suppose there are different levels of poverty.... And just to be clear, I‚Äôm not rich either. I work my ass off for what I have. And even after paying rent, utilities, food, car insurance etc... I still have $10 to spend on atoms, if I wanted. In my opinion, and it‚Äôs just an opinion, a lot of people these days feel entitled. And think they ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô things, instead of earning/paying for it. Again, this is an opinion. Feel free to downvote.
---
Hahaha $10 is my WEEKLY food budget. I work five jobs (90-95 work hours per week) including owning my own business and 80% of my income goes to rent + utilities. Still not quite lvl 200 in spite of playing since initial BETA due to how few hours per week I can spend playing. I can kinda justify the cost of FO1st, though, so I generally have enough atoms to get things every once in a while.
---
Anyone actually giving solid proof and not just parroting something they heard over a year ago from a friend is always good in my books. Have my upvote sir or ma'am.
---
The timer shows the length of the last box you popped. However as the previous boxes timers expire your lunchbox will reduce in effectiveness. Another words it'll show 100% for one hour but at some point in that timers life it'll go to 75 50 25 and eventually 0. 
---
And remember that going over 4 boxes at all glitches the effectiveness of any of the boxes losing the xp potential.
---
Came across my first griefer/trap camp in a while. Person randomly joins my public team and then emotes for me to follow them. It was a bit odd but since the name wasn't all too sketchy or toxic sounding, I decided to give them the benefit of doubt and followed them to their camp. They led me to a room with a vendor on the opposite side of a window. They then leave the team and proceed hit me with a ton of radiation emitters all at once.
---
Funny part of it all was that since this was a new character(around level 40's so far), I typically never keep any junk on me and I had just thrown all my junk into my stash anyway. Second thing was that they didn't manage to kill me and tried to act all innocent(thinking I had died when they rejoined the team) using the "confused" emote.
---
They continued to try and do the same with more players but all in all, they screwed off when another player aimed a nuke at their camp.
---
i just nominated u
---
Is Line in the Sand even still running? I haven't seen it in 2 days and figured bethesda put a stop to it.
---
Eh I kill them and settlers for the easy XP and stims / loot. :)
---
Instead of crying about this on Reddit, maybe play the game. Get better at it, get more powerful weapons and armour. Then it could be you one shotting everything......
---
I gues thats cool man. Idk im a pretty frugal individual so in my eyes its a waste to pay for something early on when you could just play to get it instead
---
I had no idea.  Thanks!
---
This, so much this. Exactly my experience.
---
Lol im confused by your comment.
---
Id drop fireproof down to 1 rank and move those 2 points to something else.  
---
Maybe add 2 to perception so if U wanna run silos fast u can put 3 ranks of lock pick.
---
A mass dupe of weapons and people complaining nothing new really
---
Nope did it last night but they didn't glitch the spawns luckily.  
---
The double exp weekend was when i saw most of the spawn glitching and zero exp.
---
Can anyone comment on the minecart cooking station? I am interested but want to make sure it looks cool, isnt overly huge, and isnt bugged out.
---
I think so. Ill have to double check tonight when i load in. Still looking?
---
I used to have my camp there. I'd come back to the poor kittens lifeless body. Upon inspection someone was putting canned dog food inside of the kitten...
---
My investigation ended without anyone brought to justice (ie nuked for their act).
---
Pretty much. It‚Äôs not the games fault that players weren‚Äôt paying attention and someone delivered the final blow while the sbq was out of bounds, or close to being out of bounds. There is a fence up for a reason. Sorry buddy.
---
Might be even simpler to just make it a weekly cap instead of a daily one, let people who can only solidly play on the weekends or whenever to turn in their goods all at once to catch up.
---
Oh no, I take full responsibility and do not recommend. I'm sure I would still be doing the same chores if I had the option, but it definitely "cured" me üòÇ
---
You can't expect that narcoleptic carpenter to kill a group of raiders now can you?
---
I hear you, I‚Äôm just across the border in Maryland. I‚Äôm pretty outdoorsy and that‚Äôs part of why I enjoy this game: in the extreme temps of winter and summer, I can still go hiking around West Virginia.
---
It's fun when people twist your words to suit their own message. Makes you realize that they know they're wrong, but reeling to maintain "dignity." (Kinda immature tbh, says a lot about where you're at) I don't really care about the atom shop existing, and never claimed to. But as a human being, I'm going to complain when I want something but can't justify getting it. Use that to attack my character all you want, you're deluding yourself if you pretend you don't do the same shit.
---
Penitentiary ain't that bad once you've done it several times. There seems to be only 6 or so locations they spawn at. I probably get through the penitentiary faster than the galleria, and the penitentiary has the bonus of being on the way if you're doing the crater &gt; davenport &gt; foundation &gt; camp &gt; repeat rotation for daily rep.
---
Astroturf floor in the atomshop + garden tiles from foundation
---
Thank you so much! I'm glad the team is compensating everyone. As a new player this glitch was quite annoying.
---
No, the point is the guy that sees the legendary spawn gets the legendary; it's just rng.
---
I can one shot them if i want but i dont since i use vats critical build.

Astro turf
---
The prison
---
Lol I hear that. I‚Äôm often torn between my love of playing video games and my love of the outdoors but temps like this make the decision easy haha.
---
Mine must be visually glitched, as I popped a lunchbox about two hours ago, yet the timer says I have an hour left at 75%, and I've only been around two other dudes that popped one
---
Anything that's not bloodied or junkies lol
---
It's a pain in the ass server hopping a gazillion times to find the pet you want and it's my understanding they're pretty squishy and people lost them easily. So most people don't bother. 
---
Shadynasty has been patrolling my camp over several moves since wastelanders however.  Maybe I just got lucky.
---
Gotta get better than now tho
---
Fingers crossed ü§û New map - Inside of the Whitespring (pistols/melee only) welcome to the thunderdome bitches!
---
Same. Also herd mentality and empath ... to the point of getting annoyed if others don't run those so my strange in numbers rocks. 
---
ALWAYS grouped now
---
I have a question: do you become wanted for destroying punji boards?
---
I'm on the cliff over by Foundation, next to the monorail junk pit, but I've been there since early 2019 so it's more accurate to say they built next to me. I'm hoping maybe some day Bethesda will add free fast travel to Foundation and Crater; I love when people come and visit.
---
Thank you! This is glorious!
---
I've been using a furious lever rifle for a while and the damage increases after each shot. They could have broken it since I played yesterday though?
---
Perk card Weapon Artisan lets you repair to 200% , but I think it is only available at lvl 40.
---
It's a trick, but not a hard one!
---
You can't grow anything on foundation blocks, but you can use the "rug trick" to plant elsewhere and then move it to the block.  The astroturf floor tile is what you saw used to simulate grass.  I don't think it's available right now, it comes and goes in the atom shop.  Check of course, it's Tuesday and I haven't logged in for a few days.  Might be a little bit before you can get it so save up some atoms in case it's 500 or something stupid...
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEEccVdwnko) will walk you through the actual act of placing plants on non-dirt spaces.  Astroturf isn't special - you definitely can't plant in it by default so you can try the trick now and just keep an eye out for it if you want it for the aesthetic.
---
imagine if they increased all NPCs health based on bloodied damage , every other build would have as enemy SBQ at every corner
---
I've got a few and they all work as intended.
---
Ah. Thanks! I‚Äôll keep an eye out for it!
---
Place down a farmable tile gotten from the settlers for 500 gold, go back to camp and place it down and then place crops on the foundation or floor. Then replace the floor with astroturf or any floor skin so the plants are growing on the floor and not farmable tiles.
---
Just that I make just enough to cover the $3,000 a month my lil studio apartment + utilities cost in the SF Bay Area and I carve money out of my food budget to play this game already. A spare $10 is me splurging on food for the week.
---
This seems be more common now than ever before in fallout. They should bring back pvp
---
Holy shit. Dual, suppressed bloodied 10mm, or a bloodied and a Junkie's. I could see a lot of people complaining about stacking meta, but I fully support it.
---
Dude you are seriously butthurt. If you dont like the way video games are going go make your own. Video gaming companies cannot reasonably justify suppporting video games for years with out there being additional sources of income man.
---
Not sure but try connect those stairs with floors (floor must be legit or connect to the ground, your building, not in the air) then remove the stairs
---
Obviously the care about the integrity of the game as well. Hence you cheat. You get banned.  Paying a sub and buying atoms doesn‚Äôt make you immune to the terms of service.

I'm level 450 and still learning. There's always a little nugget of knowledge that makes the game a little easier or your experience a little better. 
---
My best tip is to be part of communities. No necessarily active part but read listen etc. I've learned more from others than just doing it myself.
---
Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse, near Uncanny Caverns and Riverside Manor, it's a 0 lock terminal and no one goes there.
---
Kind of the opposite for me. I built my camp at the alien guidestones because the Zetans are dicks and hopefully my shop using their stones as a backdrop will piss them off.
---
Furious does work on heavy weapons, can't confirm anywhere else.
---
Furious has been buggy for a long time. It's shows the correct damage at times, and then on another day it doesn't. Now, i have not been following furious discussions that closely as i dont use them, so i don't know/remember if it is just an visual bug or an actual damage bug. The way it is supposed to work is to increase your damage by 5% each shot up to stack of 9 or 45% increased damage.
---
Okay i get that and i respect the grind man. Im not downing people for not having the money, what im saying is if i dont have the money to buy something im not going to take to reddit and try to fry  bethesda for selling stuff
---
Why would they announce an end to it? That would simply be a green light to the Dupers to restart.
---
The main front of the wave may have passed but I suspect it'll be ongoing from here on. There's fewer posts now because the most people have vented already, and many have found little or no sympathy.
---
People who eat people are people too!
---
You can sort of accomplish this currently with the double wall trick, but obviously that means double the budget used, and while it may be negligible for interior walls it'd add up real quick doing it for every exterior wall. I'd say it's another good argument for the actual double sided walls everyone keeps asking for; use those for your exterior, and you can throw up flagstone wallpaper on the outside and whatever on the inside.
---
Seriously, Bethesda, just give us the damn double sided walls.
---
Wait there's rng involved? You don't just head over to the closest watering hole and take your pick?
---
If you build the farmable tile, then plant crops, you can then edit the floor to a different appearance, and the crops will stay.
---
I always go to middle mountain cabins. One of the cabins has 3 rad roaches in it with a lv 0 terminal in the corner.
---
If they did then that is corruption
---
I hate more that running out of AP mid jump suddenly makes you lose all momentum.
---
It‚Äôs because no one really did them, there‚Äôs some events that most people don‚Äôt really do even though they should

Jesus thought I was doing well at level 65 that's some going admitted I've been looking for bloody asylum dresses most of week.
---
Does anyone else have the problem where they just stop running for a split second before being able to move again, has happened to me a few times, I've been killed because of it ü§£
---
I don't know all the precise details but AA stacks with diminishing returns.
---
My first thought was a Modern Family joke.
---
Excellent, thanks for putting my mind at ease.
---
Yeah so they should nerf bloodied damage but no people downvote me when i suggest that. I only have positive karma due to my posting so much in the comments.
---
I dont know ab for anti armor but for example i have a junkie build so my addiction bonuses stack but it doesnt stack past 5 addictions so maybe anti armor only stacks up to 100% but idk honestly
---
The Army base where you do your training. There‚Äôs a level 0 terminal in the top office.
---
If you pay for a service then legally you expect to use that service. Imagine paying for Netflix and then have them turn around and say "nah" because somebody looked you up on Facebook and didn't like your political views. Imagine paying for entrance to a sports event then being seated behind a giant screen that blocks your view just because you were rude to somebody. You wouldn't be expected to roll over and accept it. This situation is no different. Bollocks to the terms of service. Not a single person read much less cared about them when they created their account. Either unlock people's accounts or issue refunds. Frankly, they're lucky they haven't been slapped with a lawsuit yet.
---
Have they mentioned adding new maps? I've grown to thoroughly enjoy NW even tho I hate other. Games like Fortnite and Apex. But Morgantown is definitely getting old... Hardly ever get to play the Flatwoods map
---
I always go to Mama Dulce‚Äôs where ‚ÄúFeed the people‚Äù happens. Going through the tunnel to the underground. There‚Äôs a lvl 1 right there
---
I don‚Äôt expect or want them to announce an end to it. I was asking off a normal player‚Äôs perspective whether the ban hammer was still swinging.
---
It's the exact same shit with the succulents, they hidden behind a bundle that in my case isn't worth it.
---
I know some good spots to ambush people
---
They do "stack" but they are multiplicative not additive. Meaning AA (50%) + Stabilized (45%) is not 95%, but 72.5%. Almost everything in this game is calculated the same way. Like damage % reduction effects.
---
You can cheat as long as you find the broken vacuum tube soon as you repair it the quest will update but you can't do the intelligence check

I always log out when its the penitentiary and hope for a better location like Wavey Willards
---
I die easily in pvp. And no, I don‚Äôt play pvp games. Hell, wouldn‚Äôt even have bothered with NW except for the challenges. And the frustrating thing I find with this challenge is that nw barely spawns creature so it‚Äôs hoping you have luck in finding one. I managed to find one today and die quickly. The next game
---
I lasted a lot longer and found absolutely no creatures. Even managed to kill a player (rare for me) before I died but didn‚Äôt find one creature).
---
I'll check it out. PSN?
---
I'm at 82 on the board. Mostly like you from leveling. I'm an altoholic and split time but decided to focus on my main for a bit. I think I made a good 60-75 levels this weekend. Suspect with moderate activity from here I'll hit 100 early next week.
---
I cant say I keep 100% up to date on things but I dont believe there has been any mention of them doing anything for nw. No maps, no updates, not a thing.
---
If anyone has tested this angry turtle has. Maybe he hasn‚Äôt yet. Not sure. Look up his YouTube and search his videos. He‚Äôs tested so many things like this.
---
Haha. It's funny I have one character that is a cap generator 30k/day and one that's a cap sink 30k/day. Net caps = 0
---
If u copied the films from Netflix and sold them on dvd you‚Äôd be prosecuted and have your sub removed if they caught you. No different to duping. There‚Äôs a terms of service to use the service. You break that contract it‚Äôs null and void. Bye bye
---
I had the same issue on Xbox, what I did was scrap the buggy one make a new one apply shielded and that fixed it for me
---
I tried creating a new character but the idea of relearning all the plans, doing all the grinds, getting all the gold just fucking killed me. I'd love a new game + all my stuff transfers over, and I start back at level 1
---
Yes, only money. Bethesda focused on new  content only. They don't want to do something with base game, which has a 7600 bugs. Example, since release I can't use any explosive heavy weapons, because all of them with broken damage. Damn, even VATS is broken. Core game. Base things. But... they want money and good reviews... About dupers simple solution - permanent ban for ruining a game. They are not welcome.
---
Yeah we don't get a big free item every week, they're just bonuses, nothing to expect 
---
But when it's something cool it's a nice surprise
---
You are amazing. Now I might actually use that thing.

 Guess I should put a /s on that comment lol. That was a (make some new maps).joke.

I went from 255 to 310 this weekend can see it slowing now though.
---
Go ahead and knock out the weeklies, the double score is only for the dailies
---
So wat happens if zorbo finishes first ? Do we miss out on some bonus item ?
---
Wait, are we really sure shes a human and not an AI robot? Given how much her lines repeat she may have died some time ago and we don't even know it yet.
---
Yea. I‚Äôve seen a few for sale at player‚Äôs camp. And so far I‚Äôve found a 1 star but it was level 15 I think. And then another 2 star level 30. 
---
Put those things where they belong. In the legendary scrap machine. 
---
Still waiting for that bloody 3star.
---
Yeah, that's piracy. Using an exploit left in the game to copy some pixels to gift to your friends isn't. Take off your do-gooder blinkers and stop being a blathering idiot üòÇ
---
Not really. The second reduction AA acts on rest of first reduction. Ex 1st 50% + 45% x 50% ( rest of first) = 72,5 %, as order doesnt matter, 1st 45% + 50% x 55% ( rest of first) = 72,5%
---
Just a guess, create a new underarmor and mod the new one.
---
Bye bye duper. U broke the terms of service. And bull did anyone do it to gift their friends. You did it to obtain other high end items. You cheated. You got caught. Suck it up
---
You make a legal agreement when entering into that service. If you break those terms that is on you and you are owed nothing.
---
Me too
---
Thanks man!
---
I‚Äôd love to see that lawsuit. It would be quite entertaining.
---
Baaaaah! Baaaaah!
---
Ohh ha, I really wish they would tho.
---
Good job man. good fix.

---
Oh look. You must have made to many after gifting your friends. Dirty whiny cheat. Bye bye üëã
---
I just bought a f/25/90rw Gatling plasma recently and have felt very underwhelmed by it. I‚Äôm guessing server lag could play into it because if the shots aren‚Äôt registering as consecutive hits on the same target, then the dmg output won‚Äôt scale. But I‚Äôm not great at testing because I like to pew pew too much.
---
I took it recently to behemoth and I noticed severe rubber banding in behemoths health bar. I didn‚Äôt like that at all. I‚Äôm wondering if I use vats (as much as I can) with it, if the rubber banding will still occur?
---
Yeah I had one drop the other day, 3\* but I can't recall the other 2 stars.  Nice to have but nowhere near as fun as using my B25 UGL as a daily driver.  Goes through ammo way too quickly, so I let my ammo machine and Raider protectron build up a 5mm reserve then go on a spree in Heart of the Swamp to spray down the hordes that spawn.
---
Thanks, I'll have to stop buy later when I'm on. How much longer are you gonna be on?
---
If you want foot traffic, you need to stock your vending machines with a good quantity and variety of stuff. It's really the first or only reason most people will stop in.

Yep, fallout has had this perk for a while. But they won‚Äôt expand on it! This is a post apocalyptic game , this subject would definitely be a reality for some!

Yup, gotta love the world class sprinters that can outrun a Deathclaw, kill said Deathclaw, sprint straight to you while your trying to pick your jaw up off the ground and also hit you while you're 15 feet in the air because your a mutant kangaroo
---
I don't know why they changed it at all. The pre score kill 3 creatures in NW was reasonable and you could get it in 1 to 3 matches even as a bush wookie. 
---
They want more people in NW but then they screw us when we do jump into NW.
---
Huh odd she worked fine for me
---
Oh awesome good to know thanks
---
Cant stand the dried lakebed, place just feels draining to me. Maybe its because I can vividly imagine how miserable I would be in such a barren hot dusty environment. Or is it supposed to be cold?
---
Maybe its because I did a couple rotations in Qatar and just have bad memories being in similar looking places.
---
I'm amazed the Raiders are even still alive out there, they clearly got no skills to survive outside of stealing other people's stuff, you'd think they'd keep closer to where the people are. Or at least near water that doesn't taste like battery acid.

Of course I'm a Bloodied Gunsliger and it's useless to me just as much as the A/E/A Handmade, or B/LD/25V Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
Damn the rng, where are those Bloodied Pistols??? I've only been waiting 206 levels...
---
Knowing my xbox i would lose this photo like all the others...
---
Yeah I have a tse mini but want a bloodied fits my build better
---
"Hahahaha, no" -Bethesda
---
It‚Äôs a client/server performance issue. They can‚Äôt change it without finding some way to further optimize things (hard) or increasing the minimum system requirements as well as server specs (not going to happen)
---
Just wait for Bethesda to start banning people who are using the Line in the Sand exploit. You'll hear a change in tune real quick.
---
You can only tame things that appear as random encounters and they spawn alone. There are spots all over where these random encounters spawn. The messenger event is one of them and so those spawns are a good place to check. You'll find the mannequins piled up as one. There are the two robots talking, a sloth that spawns with a bunch of bears, some bloodeagles with a prisoner and on and on. 
---
There is one in a parking lot in the cranberry bog and west of there onto of some mountains (near the bear icon on the map) is another. You can find a map online that shows all the random encounter locations. 
---
Anyway, pick a random encounter location and server hop over and over until the animal you want spawns in, all by itself. Like the sloth/bear encounter; none of those are tameable because they're all together. Has to be all by it's lonesome. 
---
Again I got lucky on this. Shadynasty was there on my second server and my wife's ex sloth was the first one I tried on her system. 
---
Best of luck.
---
Fly you fools!
---
brother!
---
instead of hoarding stimpacks i hoard blood packs.  with chemist and super duper u can get 2 to 4 per blood pack.  weighs 1lb or 0.10 for a stimpack and only 0.30 or 0.03 for a blood pack. ALSO blood packs are cheaper to buy from robots than stimpacks.
---
It‚Äôs because they were super buggy, not because no one did them.
---
West tek for supers, inside and out
---
Bethesda no, Zenimax yes
---
Seeing as adventure mode is really the main game and nuclear winter is more an offshoot side game (I mean many of the benefits are stuff to enjoy in adventure. You really don‚Äôt get much rewards for nuclear winter mode) I don‚Äôt think this is really that much of an argument. Hell, the rewards you get for the season pass which is what you are earning FB score are for adventure mode. Seems if all you care about is battle royale you should not even care much about the season pass anyways.
---
They probably stacked their perk cards to do more damage. It can be frustrating until you do it too
---
Bingo got it, thank you
---
I can trade you a 3* bloodied 10 mm sub
---
I skip these now, it‚Äôs one less daily but whatever. If I can‚Äôt complete the challenge in one or two matches I‚Äôm out.

It just works

Airport workshop has a lvl 0 by the air traffic control tower door.
---
it Just works -Todd
---
They didn‚Äôt even open the others. Just 94 and it was wicked laggy man. You wouldn‚Äôt have liked it. You needed to play in survival server  and even then you would fail for the timer goin down cuz the game wouldn‚Äôt register ur button presses fast enough.
---
If on PC, haxxor.
---
If on console, "Get gud, son"?
---
my friend want that so badly and i'm like... you don't want that! do you even know the amount of budget that takes to display my junk collection? xd
---
And after that, they'll ban the building glitchers!!
---
Out of pure curiosity, what were you trying to do that led to this unreliable underwater cube lol
---
They probably got banned for calling people "fucking nerds"
---
I logged back on after seeing your reply and then it was bugged to the resistant lining. Damn it, I should've tried this earlier because scrapping it worked! It only cost me some GB, 12 fluorescent flux, 33 fiber and 45 circuitry but its fixed and that's all i care about lol. Cheers
---
Or with no luck in creature spawning. Just cause you got luck doesn‚Äôt mean other people got spawns too.
---
My camp is a home to a Sheepsquatch cultist!...Me!
---
BROTHER I AM HIT

Thanks for your reply. Scrapping it ended up fixing it... for now lol. Cheers
---
They have some balls alright I've getting loads of message have you got this or that. Yeah no problem, was something wrong with 100 stims  radaway and rad X I give you and the full deep pocket armour, oh you want ammo no worries what size, 50 cal now hold on a second you little shit lol...
---
Yea got a BE from murmrgh last week, and another BE from Rad Rumble, it‚Äôs capped at level 40 because of the skinny ghouls but still shoots like a boss.
---
Lawsuits don't do shit as that account that character you made doesn't belong to you period. Every Microsoft account and playstation account, steam account, doesn't belong to you. It is not your property to use and abuse. It is leased to you to use the service it is tied to. If you abuse it then you purposefully terminated the lease of use and abused the system. If the company did the wrong and then you can sue but fat chance you'll even win. Consumers have no real power when the user abused the system that was put in place by the provider.
---
If you want to get rid of garbage legendaries quick sell them cheap. 3 star gun 500 caps, 3 star armour 300 caps. They will be gone in no time. For really good stuff caps are useless.... mostly trade only. Mid tier stuff is hard because depending on players builds you need to wait for the right person to come along. 5 to 15k caps for most of this stuff. I have seen a few camps where people have clearly written on a wall above their vendors ‚Äúpm me, I also have this weapon or I need this weapon‚Äù
---
Yo, I'm not OP but do you know what tjat checkerboard stuff is, because I only have it half the time and that drives me crazy lol

I've noticed shadows get really weird in The Mire mostly

Sometimes in the dense areas of The Forest so it's gotta be some weird Foilage shader they think looks cool or something right? Lol

Wanna trade 1 for a tse mini

I would love to see your camp some time, what platform you use?
---
Pretty lucky where I am, not to rub it in, hope things get better for everyone else
---
I suck at pvp. I hate the kill a player too. I find this one easier if... and this is a big if.. I can actually be lucky enough to find a creature spawn. So far I‚Äôve played three games and I would have already got kill a player if that were the daily and only got one creature so far. And I really do suck at pvp. But apparently I have more luck with that then finding five creature spawns.

THE FKING TIRE WALL SET FOR 100 ATOMS (for 1st members) 
---
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
If you bought them today they were 1st only, the last tab always had an item each week that is 1st discount only.
---
It is always swinging. It just happened to swing at larger group of people because the dupe method was published on youtube and very widely used for a short'ish period of time. So more targets than usual.
---
Plans have weight too. Read them if they are unknown to you &amp; dump the rest.
---
At least 2
---
Had the silo been used recently?
---
Xbox, I‚Äôm actually in the process of rebuilding right this instance because of the atom shop stuff! Ill post a few pics when i‚Äôm done!
---
Thanks will try to server hop and farm this random encounter spot :)
---
It's better then 5 different Cabinet to display what I could with 2 of them
---
I‚Äôll be on for awhile, doing some other things and just leaving the game run.
---
10mm + master commando + bloody mess = you a bloody mess.
---
That would be lovely, since I sadly has ps4. But I look forward to seeing this masterpiece when it is rebuilt.
---
lol why u rude, it's just a fridge
---
I'm at the stage where I like the +4 int but I'm sick of the crap that comes with it. I have people jumping to my camp and buying things from my vendors when they are turned off. Have players pick locks to get wanted. People in low level alts harassing me at my camp. Then there are the genuine new players who think its actually a camp building team and even if it was a camp building team you can't build in people's camp anyway. 
---
I like the concept of public teams but they really didn't think it through. As someone else suggested on reddit a few days ago, the building team should have a buff like less building materials or no food and water lose when in your camp or workshop and then add a new team that gives XP or intelligence for doing dailys and normal game play.
---
He could have just scrapped them. It gives you the fertilizer and plant.
---
Nice. I have Nuka-Cola Secret Door. I wasn't sure about getting the garage before, but this will do nicely for me.
---
I'd argue that exploit is far more harmful to other players than duping. 
---
How does you having a copy of an item negatively affect me? Is it because I can suddenly make that trade with you that I've been trying to do for ages, but no one is wiling to give up their treasure for anything less than my first born?  
---
ToS broken, yes. Worthy of a permanent ban? No. Let the punishment fit the crime.
---
These people act like they have to participate in a trade with a duped item. Odds are, it's duped, and you don't have to buy it. The amount of white knighting here is ridiculous.  
---
I'm not one for exploiting, but god damn, it's almost like we need another subreddit. With blackjack. And hookers.
---
Dang! Wish crossplay existed lol, ill make sure to get some good ones!
---
If the silo had been used I‚Äôd imagine the cool down wouldn‚Äôt have let me in
---
And all he has to do was scrap the broken crops and replant them lol
---
You have no idea the physical toll ~~three vasectomies~~ *these bugs* have on a person!
---
How about a simple explanation of what I did to break the rules? That's being entitled, though, right?
---
You guys kill me. They never said why we're suspended, only that they're investigating. They have a well-documented history of doing this, but be blinded by your fanboyism. I'm actually a fanboy too, but man, everyone makes mistakes.
---
If it happens to any of you perfectly virtuous players you can come back and tell us how it feels and we'll listen because we understand that not everything is so black and white.
---
Yeah, guess he didn‚Äôt think of that
---
Did u use the same silo? Run the missile holo tape, it will tell u whick silos are ready to launch.
---
I've got 780 ish bullion tickets and at twenty tickets a day I'm going no where lol everything needs a revamp tbh.
---
i mean tbh when looking for a server there should be a 'hidden filter' to filter out if ytoure already using ultra, high, med, low quality settings
---
to aleviate that
---
I datamine and make mods for the game. I scour content in-game and under the hood.
---
Please believe me when I say there ain't shit to do in Watoga.
---
I have this same issue.
---
since the dude is M.I.A take mine

---
Can't see the timer after you purchase the pack. I only knew as I saw a screenshot from someone who hadn't bought it.
---
Scan ammo for missiles and mini nukes : drop them
---
Limit your fusion cores and plasma cores as they are heavy.
---
Look at your ammo weight. 0.005 lbs seems like so little until you consider 1000 x 10mm ammo is 5 lbs
---
Get rid of all your duplicate recipes. They add up to way more than you think.
---
Inert Flux also weighs a bunch of you have enough of it.
---
If you are overencumbered don't forget you can put on weight reducing perks temporarily just like you would an excavator suit. Then take it off after you fast travel.
---
Make bulk junk so you can sell it.
---
I ran the same silo but different server the second time.
---
Zorbo finishes when the season ends and all the rewards on the board become unobtainable
---
Even if on PC if you got into an actual firefight then it's git gud.  
---
If the guy shot you from half the map away and his name pops up over and over in the kill notification then, well...
---
Yes I wish that would already happen but of course ps and xbox would never agree to that due to pettiness haha. But sounds good, I plan on postimg mine later its really not that impressive tbh might need to hire someone to make it more of a home.
---
It works...eventually, sometimes, maybe after hitting the damn button like 50 times...  
---
Word was there was a fix on the pts about a month ago...
---
There are plans I have been needing might swing by.
---
They would never do that, it would defeat fallout 1st
---
["Probably" ;)](https://i.imgur.com/3gcwr2V.png)

lmaoo i think it's too big i don't like it xd
---
Definitely care more about money have you seen the battlepass and the huge atom nerf in patch 20 and score people aren't getting forcing players to buy more atoms (it's an option to buy for cosmetics its still an ass tactic). So yeah pretty much care more about the money
---
Can you use a plate (foot) switch with the red rocket garage door? I tried but it didnt work.
---
I even had the bug once after only opening 4 (and I checked my status effects prior and wasn't near anyone else). Sucked to take precautions and still lose 4 of'em.
---
Totally worked moving the camp. Thanks!!
---
The only decent weapon I got out the Purveyor half price sale was a Furious Fixer.   It's seemed way more effect than the plain vanilla Fixer I was using previously. 
---
Just logged in and tested it against a couple Gulpers.  First shots were in the 190s and about eight or more shots later I was doing nearly 300 damage.  Against trash mobs that only take a couple hits I was still seeing a 20 - 30% increase from start to finish.
---
Well it‚Äôs a free way for them to promote their game mode, how else would you expect them to do it?
---
I didn‚Äôt say you were currently complaining, just making a statement saying don‚Äôt get to the end of the season and than complain you couldn‚Äôt make it because you don‚Äôt play NW.
---
Am junkies and with new public teams im really noticing how often some of my bloodied teammates die.
---
I dont know how they do it, maybe falling off somewhere too tall, soaking up too much rad or just unlucky in failing to proc a dodge, but boy do they die a lot more than I do. 
---
High stats must be nice though for carrying stuff and vendors, but for damage numbers from what i see i think the only place bloodied makes a true difference is SBQ :/
---
Oh wow you reviewed it!?
---
Well in that case.. yawn*
---
sweet im rank 57 right now and haven't even done any dailies as im at work!
---
I did this the other day but on the opposite side of the map, far  north west corner, was so far off the grid that I was on the maps frame, till I reached the true end point where I wound up in an unrecoverable falling state.
---
Fortunately I was able to fast travel back to my camp. 
---
Noticed afterwards tho that I had unlimited AP. Was fun using it to fly all over the place but learned that the rocket has a built in timer that forces you down eventually no matter how much AP you got left.
---
Also learned that when going down hill that even if u stay exactly 3 feet above the ground that when you finally land that the game calculates falling damage based on your starting and ending position. So wound up smashing to the death upon landing even tho I nevet flew to a point where I'd take falling damage. 
---
I need to see if that effect can be recreated or if it was a one time glitch.
---
Made me mad tho, theres so much great space up there for camps we cant access.
---
I'm allergic to 2 one star legendaries.
---
Things worth noting - the water wheel doesnt do anything, its purely cosmetic. The greenhouse gets two varients, one with a base, one without. They're both large, and fussy about being placed, so make sure you have (flat) space for them. A lot of the plants are actually quite small as well.
---
Last atom space is level 100 that gives you 500 atoms.
---
I work 60 hours a week still at level 57. only get like 2 hours a night to play and 1 day were I can grind 8 plus hours.
---
Are you viewing the notes under that status tab in your pip boy or the actual gold exchange machine?
---
The status tab is notoriously wrong due to weird updating of values.
---
If you want a true value, check the actual exchange machine.
---
Must be nice being able to receive messages from players.
---
As a pc player, we have no form of communication, but emotes and mic. It's a fucking joke.
---
What sort of prick shot down the idea in development that "Type to chat" shouldn't be implemented into a MMO.  It's such a basic thing to have in a pc game.
---
Sorry. I'm just envious.
---
melee bloodied possibly. Ranged bloodied can just sit back all stealthy and murder everything.
---
I've seen it stomped out by 4+ people, and I've solo'd it. Depends on the server I guess.
---
Just an fyi, I believe Remove the Squatters auto-completes because the game spawns the enemies in when you get the quest, so all you need is for some other player to stumble along and kill them.
---
Ok I'll keep this in mind. I ended up with a furious chinese officer sword. I know the furious prefix is alright, but I dont know enough about the meta builds to be informed prices on stuff.
---
as someone with a job and who cant log in till around 7pm, Ive never had a daily auto complete.
---
Upvoting for title alone! Love it!
---
Omg I am so glad you mentioned this I didn't know the hunter pack released today. I need to get it because I never got the old sheep squatch plushie even though I am in love with it.
---
Oh I thought you meant manergaperr or whatever the purveyors name is.
---
It's almost like Christmas morning, eh?
---
Isn‚Äôt this in the Seneca Gang camp in the savage divide, I saw this today!
---
Truthfully, in real life are you actually a moth?
---
I built next to Atlas observatory in preparation for the upcoming fetch quests from the BoS
---
bro i think you are bananas, the only responders backpack that i remember in the game is the red one
---
aren't you getting confused with the backpack that came with the settler bundle of wastelanders?
---
You're the real MVP here
---
My build is similar, but focused on primarily using a B25 UGL so I've got more INT so I can equip both Power User and Batteries included.  Having 999 shots from a single core is a life changer, especially in sustained barrage vs SBQ and other bulletsponges.  I'm using Dodgy and Action Boy myself now, until they fix Adrenaline.  Not using Blocker, Emergency Protocols mitigates enough damage and if mobs are getting close enough to smack you, you aren't killing them fast enough.  Bear Arms lets me carry around pretty mush as many heavy guns as I want, rocking a Gatling, Minigun, Gauss Minigun, UGL, .50 cal, and an LMG and nowhere near my carry capactity.  Dump Travel Agent and only equip it if you are FTing really far away or always super low on caps, increase Tenderizer.  Not using Ricochet either 3 Luck seems too high a price to pay for such low returns.  Not using Fireproof or Lifegiver, I've got Ghoulish and Radicool instead.  In Nuke zones you only have to pop radaway to heal, and you get a carry bonus.  Good call on Legendary Perk, poison DOT is the only thing I fear in the wasteland.  Otherwise, even without using the added health bonus from Lifegiver and Class Freak mitigating mutation penalties, I still rarely die due to Emergency Protocols and the DR benefits from wearing PA.
---
There are a few that apply on ultracite. I have the original version of this one on mine, but like I said it‚Äôs just over priced and honestly should‚Äôve been included with the other ones.
---
Well theres several different tents if you've been subbed to fallout 1st for awhile.
---
Just following up on this but the issue has been resolved and a process put in place to grant those missing atoms to the players who earned them by completing Lifetime Challenges while the bug was active.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/420361/atom-rewards-issue-resolved?language%5B%5D=en
---
yeah i want a darker one
---
This is hilariously beautiful
---
Oh, and swap out Gunsmith 3 for Demo Expert 3 for SBQ fights and use a Gauss minigun.
---
Won't get a better answer here. At least it will be directed where it belongs instead of being yet another post about it.
---
I agree with the insane white knighting aspect. I have never had an issue with people duping, but what I do have an issue with is the extreme hatred for it. I feel like it may come from the few people who wanted nice gear but have not gotten anything decent by legitimate means, nor have acquired a duped one, and therefor are bitter.
---
You and me both! I‚Äôve been playing since Launch, and only bought the game because the Beta testers convinced me that you don‚Äôt usually run into other players in the game. For context, I have social anxiety and I also sometimes feel self-conscious playing FPS games because I didn‚Äôt start playing those sorts of games until I was 18 or so. So when I first started out, I dreaded the idea of finding other players, and back then, it was lonely enough that it wasn‚Äôt really an issue. 
---
Now, I love going to public events, helping low-levels, and meeting people at their camps and mine! I have Fallout 1st mainly for the scrap box and survival tent, I rarely use the private world and if I do, it‚Äôs only for farming and I switch back into a public world as soon as I can, because it gets lonely in there. Fallout 76 changed me as a gamer, no joke ... I‚Äôm even out there playing PVP in Nuclear Winter. It‚Äôs funny how Fallout 1st provides the one thing I wanted on Day One and now I don‚Äôt even like using it, I‚Äôm honestly amazed at how they re-trained me lol. Gotta switch out my flair and perk card ... I absolutely love public teams and join one as soon as I log in.
---
If they are doing them, then they aren't labeling them as Fallout First exclusive so we'd have no way of knowing they weren't just their regular discounts. And I totally take advantage of the daily sales. I rarely buy anything when it comes out or my First atoms are gone in a week.
---
My original gay bar camp ‚ÄúButt Piratez‚Äù was right northeast of foundation to capitalize on our biggest customer, ward. However I‚Äôve since moved it a bit away to flatter ground
---
I'm pretty sure that's the one, it was somewhere around Seneca Rocks I think.
---
Waves must be regular
---
Why you should always be in a group.
---
Are you able to build both the brahmin feed and chicken coop? Or is it just one or the other?
---
I really don't care about grenades. If I happen to pick them up, I usually chuck them at nearby enemies right away.
---
Edit: perhaps I should clarify. Grenades don't do enough damage, they're slow and enemies can easily run past them. It would help on lower levels, but at this point I'd rather aim and shoot with a rifle or heavy weapon than to trust the effectiveness of a nade.
---
Can you imagine the amount of camping? People only fight because one member gets spotted and attacked by the group. But outside that, too many bushwookies
---
I would love to have just some other radio station with some host that is constantly throwing shade at the other
---
I wouldnt mind slightly lower bonus but full week.
---
They don't care about small spenders when the whales complain on the forums that another player placed down survival tent to "ruin line in the sand" and threaten to move onto a new e-girl.
---
I actually got pretty lucky with that today it only took me 2 games.
---
Bro chill out. But seriously congrats
---
Tedious event with no worthwhile reward.
---
This needs more attention.
---
Have the normal and patriotic Liberty Prime. I prefer the patriotic one because it is more flashy. 
---
I love it, the voice when you enter gives you a feel of awesomeness. The voice also activates by itself when an enemy spots you and you were not in combat mode yet, so it is useful again surprise attack. 
---
All in all, I will keep it forever on my PA.
---
You‚Äôre completely right if you want to use your resource that way that‚Äôs fine but don‚Äôt complain about it. The crashing is never going to go away so adjust your gameplay accordingly unfortunately you‚Äôve had to learn your lesson the hard way.
---
When you leave the server it‚Äôs going to disappear anyway, ask any long time players and 99% put no effort into workshops because they disappear after you log. Build the bare essentials, profit from them and you‚Äôll be all good. 
---
The funny this is I‚Äôve only had my game crash 3-4times over the past two months, so it‚Äôs not nearly as buggy as at launch. 
---
If you‚Äôre trying to profit off selling water put your CAMP near a water source and you can make your own within your CAMP so it doesn‚Äôt disappear when you log.
---
I'm rank 72.
---
It absolutely is not "past that stage" and there are still plenty of griefers in the community.
---
No it‚Äôs should be easy to find. So say you wanted to do this for a 10mm pistol.look at player vendors for plans and it will be named 10mm prime receiver
---
Yeah I got one about 2 days ago.
---
This is my point. Players who didn't get caught up in this think they're hot shit. They're all virtuous and proud. Then one day they turn on Fallout 76 and see 4:8:2000 and they wonder what's going on. They contact Beth and she says nothing because fuck outta here you filthy cheater. So you're stuck reading and re-reading the only email you've gotten for a week and trying to see if you missed a line or something where they explain why you've been suspended. Of course you find nothing so you look for answers anywhere. Reddit! They'll know what's up. Only Reddit is full of torches and pitchforks and angry voices calling you a piece of shit cheating scumbag.
---
Line in the Sand XP exploit.
---
Camp budget exploit.
---
Camp merging exploit.
---
Reputation exploits.
---
These are all, technically, against the rules as well. How many people would be left if they bagged everyone who ever used one or more of these? How many virtuous posters here would disappear from the Fallout servers? They think it won't happen to them. I know. But it will.
---
Ricochet is kind of pointless, you‚Äôre doing vastly more damage yourself, you don‚Äôt really need ricochet to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. 
---
Dump scaly skin (the extra ER/DR is mostly useless in PA, and why nerf your AP?), elcetrically charged and unstable isotope (both hurt you when they trigger; you do not need more damage intake and their damage is negligible compared to your Bloodied build damage).
---
Not sure why you‚Äôd want thru-hiker, I never carry more than 10 water at a time and find plenty of food/water doing events all the time. I also don‚Äôt use blocker/dodgy. PA+EP is enough for 99% of things, the things that kill me are poison, which is why the first perk I get when Legendary perks go live is the poison resist one. 
---
I‚Äôve been running a PA/explosives/HW build since launch- https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f634e86&amp;d=sr2s32s22sw2sq2pq1pe2p00eh2ce0cu2ir2ip2s12ib4a72a04lt2l71lu0 is what I run. Most of the time, anyway. I‚Äôm on PC with perk loadout manager so I have a lot of customized loadouts for different roles.
---
We have enough walls, I want a ceiling in my house, tired of looking at the rafters and plywood
---
So I was attempting to make an A-Frame house. I‚Äôm south side, near Fort Defiance up on the mountain. Has a decent pond there, hence the water issue. I think I‚Äôm moving camp now as to avoid this issue entirely. I‚Äôd rather die of dehydration than deal with this issue ever again.
---
That's not a Scorch Beast Queen. Queen has white radiation not green.
---
Or whenever you see scorched earth event get over there put down at least 2000 damage on the queen and she should drop you a random prime receiver mod plan that you can learn and then craft
---
Auto- fixer,handmade, combat
---
Semi- gauss rifle, the dragon, sniper rifle
---
Big guns - gatling plasma and lazer are kinda tied same with 50cal and mingun
---
Everything else is kinda really close to call it
---
For. Commando :fixer shotgun:Gausse heavy auto:lmg (my personal choice) unarmed is deathclaw gauntlet
---
Wow. Very beautiful stuff. Ultimate mothman cultist is flying away with the moth. You'd almost say that player will become mothgirl.
---
Then you'll have two months landing to enlighten you about their marriage.
---
Wow - Wait, I must...
---
I am not a fan of looking for the radio vacuum tubes in the penitentiary, but I hate it when she sends me to Valley Galleria even more.  I have "thought" I was going straight for them so many times before, only to find out it is on the other side of a wall, and now I have to figure out where the other shop or staircase is located, for me to figure out how to wind my way around to the other side of that wall.
---
When I get Wade Airport or Wavy Willards, then I give out a loud cheer!  That is always such a good day!  :)
---
They could do that with Rose. She could play more metal or hard rock music and talk shit. Right now she just talks.
---
Welp, there go my atoms.....
---
Or "be killed by the firestorm... in the middle of them map"
---
The life of a bush wookie who forgets to alt-tab back into the game quite often...
---
&gt; That's being entitled, though
---
It is.
---
Taken directly from TOS:
---
&gt; ZeniMax may restrict, suspend, or terminate Your access to and receipt, play or use of some or any Services at any time. Should ZeniMax make a material change to the Services, it will provide You notice within the time period specified when You joined the particular Service, or if no time period for notice of material changes was specified, then within thirty-five (35) days of the date such notice is either (at ZeniMax's discretion) provided to You via email or is posted on the applicable product or Service or on Your "My Account" section.
---
You are owed a notice of suspension at most. No one owes you any explanation or anything more than what you agreed to as quoted above. So sick and tired of this "I cheated and violated the terms I agreed to, but I have rights!" You stopped having rights in regards to this product the moment you cheated.
---
I did every challenge for Atoms. I found those to be quick and easy. But this Legendary Chore is making me sick of playing. I want to do the first season in order to have the experience, but pointless grinds like this is why I've avoided online multiplayer games. It's more like a job than fun. And the rewards for doing the chores are no longer yours to chose. Bethesda took that away when they nerfed Atoms. It's great if you happen to like what you unlock. But to have to plow through so much crap in order to get to the one or two things I might actually use is for the birds.
---
Yep, I've made some new friends through public teams &amp; we play together now - got a good dynamic going on with team roles etc. It's weird that we all seem to miss each other if the others aren't online when all of us were distinct lone wanderers previously!!
---
Absolutely love that show.
---
I've done this before and mothman glitched up in the sky lol.
---
Yeah someone has to kill you. Your best bet is to unequip your armor and go somewhere populated and get it over with. And of course don‚Äôt forget to stash your junk!
---
I have gotten alot of good freebies. Easter for example. Its not all gold.
---
Where is that backpack from?
---
If you‚Äôre not on top of your game, those Sheepsquatch will kill all three Brahmin.
---
I will say this simply nw is incredibly skill and perk intensive
---
Doing dupes aren't exactly as invasive as running third party software or selling gear for RMT.
---
What I don't get is why dupers get banned but hackers do not.
---
It saddens me slightly when i kill a "friendly" npc. Wether its a robot or a raider. Ill usually only do it if it is attacking someone that hasnt completed the associated quest.
---
If your on Xbox then send me your gamer tag I'll stop by!
---
A super mutant with a hunting rifle is basically nothing in adventure mode.  Another player with one in NW can mean instant death.  Definitely aren't a super man anymore and I'm wondering if that's what OP expected.
---
Consecutive hits on the same target means as long as you don‚Äôt hit another target in between, you can miss or whatever shouldn‚Äôt affect it..
---
That‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to work wether it does or not is another story
---
this is a legit issue, they keep releasing new and more items, you can only place about 100 things in  your camp,
---
Lol janky. Love your unique vocabulary. It definitely induces chuckles.
---
Sounds like something to add to my auto hotkey shortcuts on PC.
---
Oh aye. Definitely. half the time they get at least one before i can kill them both
---
[If it's something like this] (https://ibb.co/YbcvPf0), then it's ambient occlusion.  You can notice it more on the bottom right of the screen near the stool legs, and on the cardboard boxes, and also in the area between the empty file cabinets, as well as their base.
---
I once submitted a pretty old thread on the ugly ambient occlusion graphic artifacts in 76 about a year ago, but it didn't seem to get many replies, so it's something either people don't notice, or don't really mind seeing.  Bck then, I found out a way you can turn it off, but it involves editing the Fallout76prefs.ini file, and disabling the ambient occlusion effect has a few problematic side effects (at least from what I remember), such as removing a lot of underwater visibility.
---
doesn't explain why people do the other one though.
---
Heavy Wespon: .50 Cal
---
1H Meele: I forgot
---
2H Meele: Supersledge Hammer
---
Unarmed: Power Fist
---
Rifle: Fixer
---
Pistol/Automatic Pistols: It varies
---
These are my personal opinions of course
---
This annoys me to no end. I am usually the only builder group in a server, but others join sometimes too.
---
Matchmaking would be painfully long.
---
For those who don't play, can you explain why the person is jumping off?
---
An all solo mode would be fun. Maybe they could make it like classic N64 Goldeneye, and set it inside a vault or other limited space.
---
It does feel that way. I often see regular events cycle several times before I see public events like Feed The People, Tea Time, Free Range, and Project Paradise. Sometimes those machines at Mama Dolce's never cool down enough to start working again.
---
They're coming back with Daily Ops.
---
They have already resumed adding new assets for V96 the past two patches.
---
The rewards are fucking ugly though. Art team smoking pcp.
---
Yeah, I got you with that. I never had trouble getting atoms for free off the challenges and was usually able to get whatever I wanted in the atom shop with that, but that‚Äôs changed now. Not necessarily for the worse or better - the new challenges have honestly given more rewards to me than just buying things with the free atoms used to net. Curious what challenge rewards will look like after this current one is over.
---
Furious damage is supposed to cap out at 45% bonus damage. 
---
Wether it works that way at any given time tho, well... you know lol
---
Do you care to post your build? That's some significant tankiness you had in that video!
---
Isn't Bethesda apart of Zenimax media? I could be wrong.
---
Good info
---
Can I kill and eat the chickens?
---
Guess they are just looking for people like me that havent seen one since getting on and will jump at the chance. I didnt mind, they were free atoms.
---
üòπüòπüòπ
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Yep same problem.  Haven't even raised a ticket as I googled it to a thread saying it could months away from a fix.
---
It isn't luck. The longer you survive, the better odds of finding a creature.
---
There should be a random free item every week, just like Fallout 4 creation club.
---
Not just designated free items like the icon, but random camp items or skins. They could start with the terribad launch items or the unused Fallout 4 assets.
---
I'd be more likely to spend money if they actually would throw us a bone once in a while.
---
Oof. Was that on the Bethesda forums? I only found the one other Reddit entry.
---
too bad, i moved it on the opposite side of my camp, and still i'm stuck in the water
---
I bought the collectors edition of 76, it lasted less than a month when it came out before i put it down.  I picked it back up a few months ago and finally feel like it is close to the game i had originally bought. 
---
NW is just a mode of fallout. Like an experimental mode. It isnt half bad, but it is definitely different than fallout.
---
Lever action beats the sniper rifle. Better damage (although no armor piercing) but vastly higher RoF)
---
You thank Todd Howard for this blessing he has kindly bestowed upon you (nothing you're kind of just screwed)
---
I had exactly that bug (daguerre doesn't wanted to continue the quest after retrieving the flight recorder). What I did was contact support and send them a recording of the problem, after a few days struggling with their generic responses they finally accepted to elevate my case to a different team and this team reseted the quest, after that I was able to complete that part and finishing the rest of her questline.
---
So I recommend to do that, just insist on your support ticket until they finally elevate your ticket to a proper person.
---
The Santatron was the only time they gave away a real item.
---
Or just clean your actives quests.
---
This isn‚Äôt even that difficult if you aren‚Äôt complete dog ass with anything that has to do with pvp
---
Melee : Donkey Punch with +40% swing speed
---
I'm playing Gunslinger atm and my current setup is :
---
1. Pipe Revolver - excellent all rounder. I currently hold a Hunters, not ideal but capable of knocking down anything except SBQ. (although it does more than enough for full rewards). 
---
2. Pipe Bolt Action - excels as a poor man's sniper rifle even with a pistol grip. Have a Stalkers atm with +100VAT/-50AP which makes anything but max range almost perfect hits. 2 Shot vs a L95 Glowing Behemoth. ..not to bad at all! 
---
3. Pipe Pistol - Fast Firing, accurate, good stopping power when boosted,, very cheap ammo, perfect for low level areas and I've even walked through West-Tek with my Instigating variant. 
---
4. 10mm - Early on its probably #1 but I feel it doesn't have the growth potential and my Anti-armour feels oddly underpowered. 
---
5. Gauss Pistol - if this was a top 10 list it would be #10. For a Gold weapon it really is lacking. Useless for snap shots it does pack power if you allow time to charge. But it's range is poor, accuracy is worse, and I'm having terrible VATS issues with it missing more 95% than it hits. (10 concecutive misses vs a Sentry Bot...thank goodness for Stealth)
---
Chance of 2 sheeps one spawns literally right under and the other spawns like 5 feet around the house. 1 sheepsquatch charge will murk the brahmin and if any brahmin die, you dont get the second plan, which is the main reason people do free range. So unless u can kill em mad fast its almost a guaranteed fail in the mire
---
I disagree. If you want to share, invest in charisma. I have (and have had) several characters. Only one of them has 9 charisma. And it feels different: he can really play for the team. 
---
Also, to be honest, 3 or 4 points are necessary for Lone wanderer or Bargain. And 3 is enough to share a perk.
---
I wouldn't call a PFP a "big free item". It takes them about 5 minutes to crop existing pictures. These should be 5 atoms a pop.
---
A lot more are on the way and they're all magazine crops.
---
How tedious. Glad to hear it *is* solvable, even if it means getting Bethesda directly involved.
---
Half as much range greater damage drop off
---
Right there with you. The last grind was NW for Hellfire. Now, log in, look around, and see the same tired activities. Log out and play something else. None of the score cosmetics or rewards are enticing enough to do the same tired dailies.
---
A lot of noobies
---
I dunno, if I was a flying scorchbeast looking down at a half dead vault dweller waiting on the ground with a suped up super sledge. I'd just scream at you until you died and wouldnt land at all.
---
&gt;ToS broken, yes. Worthy of a permanent ban? No. Let the punishment fit the crime.
---
Granted, I'm no expert, but I think this idea you state, while I agree with you philosophically, I wonder if the issue is the lack of knowing exactly where those boundaries are? Like (I make no apology for the pun) where is the line in the sand? What things/exploits are mild?
---
I believe we as a community can see that grey area for ourselves, but the lack of transparency from the real "judge, jury, executioner" may be the underlying issue many are frustrated with?
---
You spent your hard earned currency on items you would have gotten for free if you had just played. Now you're here asking what to do? 
---
If you hadn't wasted your atoms, you'd have something to do, dumb dumb.
---
Bethesda cares so much about my opinion that they comped my entire trip to Quakecon and have quoted me in trailers. Cry more :) :) :)
---
Cause unfortunately killing mobs gets you way more EXP than finishing the event. The rewards aren‚Äôt worth imo to finish it either. However I do collect ore to get us to level 1 then start whacking some mobs.
---
We have no power regardless of whether we broke the rules or not. That's the thing. They can do whatever they want whenever they want regardless. So stop mentioning ToS et al when they aren't relevant. It's a copout.
---
Uh the ban wave is actually done in a few minutes.
---
yah definately not lmao
---
That's weird because the Shielded lining came out 3 weeks ago.
---
Same boat :( spent over 1550 hours and probably like 300$ pluss 1st some months, now i Just play on a small caracter on a New caracter, but it is not the same, i have yet to hear when my temporarily suspention is to be lifted ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yes, but bethesda is the developer studio, while zenimax is its owner. Zenimax is a super greedy company
---
Yeah, CC skins were a much better way to handle it. Sprinkle out the small stuff, keep the big stuff for sale with the occasional discount. I own most to all of the armour paints thanks to this.
---
No emperor Howard! I shouldn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not the lone wanderer way.
---
This is the way.
---
I will tell you right now, no one uses Chinese officer sword. Fd76 will give you a brief description of the weapon if you scroll down. If it says average weapon, it‚Äôs trash.
---
When was this taken? What system
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with selling rare items for 10k and above, I wish people wouldnt undercut so much. It‚Äôs not hard to get caps in this game people shouldn‚Äôt just get things for free I thought that was the whole argument for duping
---
Why are you trying to shoot anybody anyway? I thought the point of that game was to hide in a bush...
---
It was the best mode once you had learned the basics. I really enjoyed the thrill. 
---
My fourth character was a survival character. Great fun. And honest fear, and the JOY of finding maybe another player who wasn't a psychokiller and who would help you survive. 
---
I miss the shit out of it.
---
Me too i love the mounts but shotty not paying 12 usd for one sheepsquatch mount
---
This is a video game.  Everything is disputed.
---
Why didn't you collect then? Easy to point fingers at other when you don't collect yourself. Also, 5minutes is more than enough to collect ores. People will collect them and turn them in at the last minute to get most xp.
---
Having paid for fallout first since day one... My services stopped working 3 days prior to the end of one cycle... And now having spent on a years subscription and it still not working.... I'd like the things I buy to actually be used and bethesda and steam stop kicking the ball at each other with customer service.
---
Sorry, what are you smoking? Sniper rifle out ranges it by like... 9. Around 5%.
---
Unstoppable is still the best Unarmed weapon in the game.
---
This seems to be the common response... "I didn't do anything". Yet, once you look through their history, there's always something. With you, I didn't even have to go down too far... You knowingly traded with a player you knew were cheating to get a duped item you wanted lol. Thinking that is not an attempt at cheating the TOS you agreed to is a whole new level of entitlement.
---
Lots of grinding
---
Maybe they're waiting to turn in?
---
We had almost the opposite problem. Two running 4-6 "defending" we lost a guy before we both turned in for 90 exactly, then we both, maybe another collected the remainder.
---
Hard to believe with three up top using explosive energy weapons and a couple slashing away could save them all.
---
We gave thumbs up and heart hands at the end though. Still the most fun event IMO.
---
‚ÄúIt just works!‚Äù Has become a hilarious in-joke with my gaming group because of stacks of issues like this. I don‚Äôt even try to use my guass rifle anymore. Oh, Bethesda...
---
Clean your xbox. Open it, take a can of air to it. 
---
It is choking trying to keep cool.
---
Finished it with the exact same amount or ore as in this screenshot.
---
Same I'm way ahead of the game I was on quarantine waiting on test results when double xp hit I'm halfway to 84 zorbo ate my dust
---
Around tree-fifty
---
Agreed. I see these posts a lot and wonder the same. I'll be the first to admit I camp the deposit spot and fire down both hallways for XP. I don't care if it succeeds I've gotten the drops I just want the xp.
---
It takes just one person to get above the 25 threshold to succeed and 2 people can get above the 75 threshold for best event drops. Right now given the legendary board game the most valuable thing is XP. The event will be here for a long time but the board game will not.
---
5 minutes ago, PC.
---
As a bloodied guy, I think I‚Äôm more suited to crowd control than ore collecting, and I‚Äôve already gotten the hazmat suit and rad barrel. Having said that though 10 people at an event not doing the one thing you need to do to complete it is kinda BS.
---
60 for me
---
Just realized too the image shows 20 ore collected... Someone is clearly collecting. 5 more succeeds the event.
---
Maybe they have just run out of fucks to give?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqbk9cDX0l0
---
Maybe because they were after XP, playing the SCORE game.
---
I'm saying they don't care about banning accounts that only spent $80, but rally behind the ones that have spent $500
---
I collected that 20.
---
Stairs are time consuming
---
Ah guess some just love the green guys shoot out.
---
If only this game had a better communication system.
---
Now now. I wasn't really enjoying the grind and had all these atoms mouldering waiting for something to get spent on. Frankly pretty close to done with the game - in a "Ive mastered it" kinda way anyway. Repetitive tasks get old and are no replacement for new content. The rewards were not really worth it to me. It is SOOOO beth that the ultimate reward doesn't work worth shjt! Just nothing better out there right now. But gonna try something else till something changes.
---
I didn‚Äôt get a drop I think but I‚Äôm pretty sure I got it from purveyor 3 star bloodied mini gun. But I could be wrong and could‚Äôve gotten from a drop. Because I also have a berserkers explosive mini which is no use to me being I have high damage resistance
---
That would be great for Bethesda to clarify. Unfortunately, as we have seen, they have not fully ranked up the communication perk. Especially since with this wave, *many* disgruntled users have duped for the first time after seeing the lack of enforcement of dupes recently. 
---
I'd say using 3rd party programs (such as spawning in items or hacking in NW) is the highest offense, while duping and camp glitches are on the more mild end.
---
Now that we have public teams there should be raid teams. I would do it if this were the case.
---
My bloods in it you can craft. There is also a nuka orange and a nuka grape in the basement room at the frat house where the nukashine quest starts. There are also some nice nuka cola collectables in there like a nuka racecar and some mugs and glasses.
---
Got some tips
---
Tossing molotovs with or w/o the aoe range perk
---
Weapons with the explosive legendary effect
---
And ground spamming tesla shots are all amazing ways to get multiple tags in.
---
You still get the one shooters but aleast you might get in on some drops and exp.
---
What rewards? I've been there for multiple full finishes and have never gotten a reward. I‚Äôve assumed it's broken.
---
I'm not talking vats range I'm talking sighted range people actually used it for sniping before the damage cap was introduced
---
This post was made 10 minutes ago. So you were here making this post and taking / importing pictures while other were doing the event. Slow clap.
---
This man is a legend he gave out b2525 fixers and be25s laser rifles, he was actually the real robin hood of dupers
---
I try to find his camp and visit it asap. Those are usually the best ones in terms of design and details. And you often get great prices for even the best gear since caps don't matter to those players. 
---
I don't even think about how many hours of gametime they must have, peoples lifes are different and who am i to judge?
---
Dang. I was about $250 short. üòÇ
---
Well then they should do that.
---
You can't store if it's broken, it's scrap or repair.
---
Sounds like there's a glitch (I was unaware of) that Mothman gets stuck suspended in the air. When that happens I guess people try to jump as close as you can and hit the "Activate" button to un-suspend him. Others want to try and land on him, and some just don't want to take the stairs down.
---
Brain Fungus Soup for the INT bonus is another good xp increase.
---
No it's not.
---
Yeah, if that's your interpretation of what I said then I won't even bother to continue this because it proves my point - you can't see anything past your entitlement...

If you‚Äôre looking to buy it off another person, I‚Äôve seen them for sale twice since it came out.  One time for $15,000 and the other time 25,000 caps. Those things are only obtainable by grinding and spending a lot of time and effort doing the possum challenges. I wish you luck. I doubt anybody would be willing to just give it away for caps though.
---
Low frame rate, bad loading times and poor graphics, yes.
---
But my Xbox only crashes 76 once in a blue moon. Probably worth cleaning your xbox
---
I am more cautious before going into Mirelurk King/Hunter territory than before joining Scorched Earth/Encryptid.
---
Nobody was doing the event lmfao. How long do you think it takes to make a post?
---
I'm not going to do all the work for a group of lazy fucks that just sit crouched and invisible and shoot enemies mindlessly.
---
The first few times I played it, I had no idea how to collect the ore. It‚Äôs honestly not very intuitive. I had some dude get all Whitney at me over voice and scream at me etc. he followed me to the next event I did and tried to tell everyone i was a scammer or something and tried to get people to like ‚Äú block me off in a room‚Äù so that I couldn‚Äôt leave or something idk. Eventually the event ended and I was sharding gear and some zombies or mole men swarmed near me and the  dude like full autod them and hit me as well and that flagged him and I turned his ass out and stole his loot so.... don‚Äôt be a dick.
---
Tie between Toxic Valley and Ash Heap
---
Thats metal af.
---
Does this happen exactly at this spot all the time, or is it just an awesome coincidence?
---
Awesome thanks!
---
... 
---
Are you trying to say the listed Range on a weapon is VATS range and NOT related to actual damage dropoff range? Because to the best of my knowledge, damage dropoff in OR out of vats is strictly related to the range stat. And the hunting rifle only has \~5% higher range stat.
---
Agree totally and wouldn't be surprised.
---
Do you have the stove cooking station plan? Level 135 still don't have it and it kills me
---
This makes me seriously question my decision to erect concrete walls around my camp this morning.
---
because EXP is far more precious than garbage rewards/exp for complete?also event will dissapear right after u put 100ores inside . U ll get it soon when u reach some high level and some experience. By the way, from 3 ghouls u ll get same experience as completing that event
---
Lmao I misunderstood your sarcasm for heckling since it‚Äôs popular with this game and messaged you to avoid more distortion.. haha calm down guy.
---
Does anyone know what it makes out at? Or does it just keep producing?
---
When you complete this event he will always spawn there before landing
---
Witcher 3 blood and wine. A bit less than base game, but still
---
They cycle pretty fast dude save your atoms and give it a few weeks.
---
Yeah. Instead they do this and will add my complaint if I liked the mechanic and it makes it totally not a survival game at all and I liked the survival lite.
---
I enjoy Bloodied when all STEALTH perks are on. You should stay invisible.
---
Gee kid, does you mom dress you funny too?
---
I would be much more likely to buy things on the spot if they were in the shop. Right now I just forget about it 20 minutes later lol
---
Do the badges my friend.
---
There‚Äôs a three hour cool down per silo after you launch. Hopping worlds doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs character specific.
---
And the one in the savage divide usually gets one shot.
---
Once you hit $1000, they fix your bug reports the next day. ü§ë
---
Same with brewing alcohol
---
Is anyone actually testing this? Because that's not how this works. I don't keep any ammo in my stash and there is never any put their by my ammo machine. Always have to collect manually. There is no connection between the ammo machine and your stash the way there is with display cases, fermenter, punch bowls, etc.
---
Earlier I was grinding out yesterday‚Äôs dailies for my wife before the reset, myself and another guy spawned in at the same area. He got to the chests before I did and was shooting me so I booked it to a nearby house. No chest inside, but one of the generic dressers had an automatic pipe rifle in it, so I grabbed it and spun around just in time to see him coming up the stairs behind me. Gunned him down, thus getting my wife her ‚Äúkill a player‚Äù SCORE. When I looted his bag he had a Combat Shotgun, 50. Cal and and automatic radium rifle. I wonder if he knows he was killled so quickly with such a low tier weapon?
---
Designer diapers I‚Äôm sure.
---
FERTILIZER!? I want eggs, wtf. I also want an Addictol recipe that uses eggs.
---
The range listed is the maximum range the simulated projectile travels before it suffers from a penalty the range you vats from is based on several variables. 
---
My best advice is to watch video on weapon mod making to get a better explanation . also the scopes magnify from different bases so a long scope for one gun will have less range than a long scope from another
---
Oddly enough, it wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be 
---
Holy shit, that example though
---
Mmmm how many power cores you carrying around for your power armour? You might want to check their weight ;)
---
This ^^^ü§£
---
They spent time on many GB of assets that haven't seen the shop or game and likely never will. It's all on your hard drive.
---
Normally I'm not into vindictive bullshit.,but " Started chucking those bitches like it is reclamation day. " has me in tears.
---
Will do üëç thanks
---
You're right, but it does seem a bit bleak next to the bonuses that Relish, Lover's Embrace/Well Rested, Very Well Rested (Lunchbox), Inspirational/Lone Wanderer (perk cards) and a Building Public Team provide. ;)
---
That one's mine, they messed up.  You can give it to me later.
---
Congrats! I wasnt able to play at all this double xp weekend so Im 3 places behing Zorbo. Hope I finish it soon, those rewards look SICK.
---
I do not, actually just found it for myself the first time a few days ago
---
Yes, they are. You need to walk the stealth+high luck+VATS path, and you will see the light. 
---
My gunslinger has always been the most rewarding one. So cool, so full of style. 
---
Keep a silenced 10mm with you, just in case. Main with an instigating or Bloodied revolver.
---
I disagree.
---
Rifleman - Pipe Revolver Rifle 
---
Gunslinger- Pipe Revolver Rifle 
---
 Can use both perk sets with that weapon. Pipe is life.
---
Yeah this sucks big time. Was able to switch weapons real quick and then back and still had the same core as before to use it up. Don‚Äôt know why it does this though. Although I have had it where it says I have 400+ shots a few times and when I look at the ammo it shows two cores selected. So no idea what the hell is going on
---
Always have been.
---
Gratz
---
I believe to remove depth of field completely you need to edit the .ini
---
Oh, that's why I kept finding fusion cells in my stash that I didn't remember putting in there.
---
nope! you can max both via dailies after the main quest :)
---
Mire, low visibility puts me on edge as a stealth sniper
---
Commando: Fixer
---
Shotgun: Gauss

Gunslinger: Gauss

Guerrilla: 10mm

Heavy: Gauss
---
1H: Assaultron Blade
---
2H: Grognak Axe
---
if u on pc this makes sense lmaoo, aint nobody ever doin anythin but watchin scavs die in that event.
---
Lower level players who don't know better will start that one and then more people are likely to join just because.
---
I love this game, but some of this shit is just inexcusable. And so many people report issues with detailed explanations/proof and they do absolutely nothing. Instead ‚ÄúbUy mY oVeRpRiCeD sUbsCriPtiOn‚Äù
---
Thing is bloodied is also the most popular build so most think like you. Whenever I do it I try to go as soon as ore replenishes for me and I'm a vanguard PA build. I just tag any enemy I see
---
What‚Äôs to add? Your a snotty over privilege, entitled ass. You cheat and blame others. You make long posts about how evil Bethesda is and uncaring.
---
You‚Äôre on a rant because you can‚Äôt play a game that you cheat at.
---
The problem is you. You think you deserve everything. You‚Äôre the type that talks about all your hard work in a video game. But you didn‚Äôt. You bought your way to win. 
---
So get bent.
---
How did you get ‚Äúscammed‚Äù if you bought the wrong plan? How is that the game‚Äôs fault?
---
They surround you in stacked ones them move them into you in build mode!
---
probably like 12 of them
---
I saw this post and immediately thought it was my wife posting. I‚Äôve heard a litany of profanity about NW and kills. She prefers to shrubwookie.
---
Mirv grenade one shoot nearly everything (68 super mutants for example), Molotov cola and plasma grenade are strong too
---
Will drop by, fellow mothman buddy!
---
some events the legendary spawn in a random location so unless i know exactly where the spawn is i cant pre-fire.
---
i dont use rifles so Tesla is out of the question unless i change my entire build just to be able to take legendarys.
---
Some events like the bugged spawns in Line in the Sand, spawn the enemies in the air and drop down so most times they get blown up before they hit the ground.
---
I assumed it was something in the files since its Fallout lol, excuse my ignorance but how would one do that?
---
I can see it return as an all time favorite soon again. 
---
I got a lot of things I feel like I missed out on. But just today I see a lot of those things returned. So don‚Äôt worry I would say. It might even be cheaper when it comes back
---
Man i havent done ovn in like 2 weeks, it just never pops up, i like that one
---
Considering how rare the plans are on my server, I would pay 500....I have been looking since day one for strait up stove plans and have not found a single one.
---
Shotguns are fun again, in a way. They overkill in Vats, and they just cause a rash outside Vats. 
---
My shotgunner became an explosives expert when shotguns became useless. He is now having the time!
---
My second plasma caster was B2525. I don‚Äôt like bloodied builds. It‚Äôs still a handy weapon for certain creatures. But it‚Äôs nothing compared to my fire axe.
---
All anyone wants to do is sit invisible in a corner and shoot things
---
Ahhh I understand
---
A grievance looked incel
---
Those are my favorite situations!
---
I‚Äôm sure that was his plan.
---
Sounds good, might be afk when you come by, also if you need any water I have two purifiers open
---
The gulpers too. See one on the ground then shoot, kill, then run to loot. Out of nowhere two more jump out of the tree. Not even to mention when they get in a low profile and charge you
---
They know there are people who will do anything to own it all. They're milking them dry because they know they'll blindly walk into that trap and pay for everything in the atomic shop.
---
https://www.gosunoob.com/fallout-76/fo76-how-to-disable-blur-depth-of-field-pc/
---
The first part will disable depth of field, but doesn't cover every implementation of it.
---
The second part about the custom .ini will ensure that all forms of depth of field are disabled.
---
No I didn't buy the wrong plan, I installed the wrong jetpack thinking it was the right one, it was a paint, that needed flux, which dosent make sense because it isn't a jetpack.

If you're on Xbox I'll take a look around! My gamertag is YouSankMe. My C.A.M.P has been getting a lot of compliments :D
---
Same.  I recently have been converting to a Bloodied Unarmed build, and in that build, Lone Wanderer is damn good. But the XP gains from Public teams is too good to pass up, so now I'm running Bodyguards instead, having to level that up.
---
Counterpoint: everyone in my builder group is a likeminded person playing in the same way I am...alone, and doing what I want! Now we just get some shared perks, half a dozen free fast travel spots, and a nice xp boost!
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
Get ready for the "I didn't cheat" response from the guy that knowingly got a duped weapon off someone. I mean, I'd have some sympathy if he got it from a vending machine without any idea, but that's not what his comment history shows...
---
Yeah. The blatant video evidence of the NW issues is wild.
---
Yeah they fucked up by not letting us test them.
---
The first stackable buff definitely needed to be tested.
---
Just hit level 50 myself today after completing my dailies. I haven't missed a single one yet and log off once complete every day. I'm guessing you guys do the same, hopefully it's enough to get us to the finish line!
---
A sacrific for the holy Mothman üòà
---
Only about 1% of the bugs get acknowledged.
---
Bloodied ruined this game.
---
Workshop events also counts towards the daily or weekly ‚Äúcomplete events‚Äù. 
---
I do those to complete easy events as it‚Äôs a positive event trigger every time.
---
Might be that for some folks.
---
I am new to the game, so I read everything and saw that was one of the requirements for additional reward. I collect ore when I can, but would be nice to have backup. 
---
I think a lot of people just shrug and say it‚Äôs a hard event. Kinda like Paradise where no one collects the food for the trough and complains when we fail. 
---
Then again, I am a recovering WoW raider, and working as a team is in my blood.
---
I solo the queen from on top of my tent all the time and she has no problem landing for me it's the people that float there tents that are the problem
---
No I‚Äôm on Xbox one
---
If it makes you feel better, siding with them in the wastelanders story really screws them over and makes them unfit to continue raiding the settlers!
---
Yeah, this is bs. I have a 3GB/s PCIe ssd, a 400Mb/s internet connection, yet sometimes when I spawn, all of the crates within 500 yards have already been looted and I am killed by another player while unarmed. That's so fun. 
---
I have to mute my sound while in the lobby because I associate the music there with seething anger.
---
That's understandable. Just wandering why this guy has been swinging his deathclaw gauntlet at me for the past 15 minutes while I sit on top of the workshop halfway claimed.
---
I have this really sketchy doorway in my camp that you need to jetpack or marsupial into, it's not a trap, just a dumb joke,  but the existence of trap camps added that sense of risk for anyone who took the chance to explore it.
---
Sometimes they die to fall damage when they spawn in. If you have your camp there, try removing the object you placed on his spawn marker.
---
It would be easier if it was kill a creature or a player combined
---
Sadly, this is the nuka Machine that dispenses a drink (nukashine). It just fits in the door
---
I personally dont care about the voting system on reddit
---
Maybe just boredom tbh. 
---
Some people just like pvp. 
---
Maybe hoping you would wanna pick a fight as well lol
---
Trying to earn the challenge rewards?
---
Jump on top of the little shed if you can, crouch and aim for the body or legs.  Not the head.  You'll kill her easily unless you are a melee build, then RIP.
---
Yeah but in 2 minutes you be gone
---
Use a crossbow /w VATS or a melee weapon like the pros ;)  Shooting loud fire arms is basically letting everyone within a mile know where you are.
---
The bug you've encountered goes even further. You're able to put that "fake jetpack" on t65 arms.
---
Some folks claim they've managed to get the jetpack to work on the arms but I've never seen that happen, except on strangler PA.
---
Doesn't matter that their is a challenge.
---
If I were to capture a workshop then spend time and resources on setting it up, I have to give it up just because the daily challenge has something to do with workshops? Doesn't sound right to me.
---
I put the nukashine dispenser in the door. That's all
---
He's a level 57 and I am playing a level 7 character. Uranium Fever is literally happening as we speak...

If you go negative karma you cant post as often, there is a timer between posts. i do have another Reddit with over 1k karma i should use that if this ones goes negative.

Nah. It‚Äôs all about what you can achieve. It matters little what others do. Enjoy your time.
---
Nice.  Congrats!
---
Not unusual I would say haha
---
Sort of.
---
A midwestern settler! I agree with you entirely. I want the cold weather back. I want my toes to be freezing when I go to bed so they warm up to to a proper 'lukewarm' temperature under the covers (antidepressants make my toes too hot to sleep, it's annoying). I want to go outside in layers then take the outer one off to feel the cool air whisking away my profuse sweating (...antidepressants again). I want to face negative temperatures head-on, reminding me how insignificant I am in the greater scale of things. Winter is a cruel mistress, but I loved her before antidepressants lowered my core temperature and made anything above 72F unbearable, and I love her more dearly now.
---
What stops anyone from just making a new reddit account then?
---
Use cryo floater grenades that freeze her very well and u can still use your dcg
---
Did you look in caves? It glows. Look in the swamp and under bridges
---
Try any cave or mine
---
Well i would be negative right away lol
---
What benefit is it to hold a low level workshop? Offers extremely low XP and rewards.
---
Will it avoid her spraying bitch ass acid? I tried the body, but took me actually a while to realize she dealt more damage to the legs, but I already ran out of most bullets and stimpacks by then so I kept dying.
