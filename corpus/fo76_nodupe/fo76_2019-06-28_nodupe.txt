I agree with this poster, those two serums are the most popular.

I have 95k 2mmec on xbox if anyone wants some
---
No. I use rank 1 rejuvenated. My swap it for something useful.

Having a faint disdain for anyone who wants a structured framework over ‚Äòhere‚Äôs a costume. Go nuts!‚Äô only enables Bethesda‚Äôs shortcomings - now and in the future. The players do make the game, but only if they‚Äôre provided the right tools to fully realise themselves in that game world. Some will be ok with making up a bigger shortfall themselves, simply because they love the world, but to say anyone who either can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt is lacking imagination is childish and reductive. 
---

---
Look at the level of charity in FO76 as an example. Sure, some of it is because most PVPers have left, but a big part of the equation is higher level players having nothing else to do. Bethesda acted as though we were just the nicest community ever when, at least in part, the overwhelming charity was a result of their failure to provide any other options.
---
Are you honestly telling me that in 2020, you believe the videos people make and put up on the internet?
---
I've seen plenty of the content you're talking about. A bunch of it portrays the game as great fun, another bunch portrays it as a buggy horror.
---
The only way to really know is to download it and see for yourself. I did and have found the game to be really enjoyable, despite a few bugs and glitches (but then all fallout games have suffered from this - Fallout 3 was significantly worse in my experience), and I won't be persuaded otherwise by people who haven't even tried it.
---
Reading up on a game can give you an idea of the reported pros and cons - you won't know how they effect your personal experience until you try it. The downsides of Fallout 76 have been massively overstated.
---
They could work in some sorta of lore such as a mission where you nuke a cave/zoo and they get released or a raid into a government vault where they stored seeds and animals incase of apocalypse and the dwellers got bored and started messing with genetics bam you got the bases for making new creatures
---
I always hated that. I played in a wow PvP guild and you would get rolled by PvE guilds. 
---
It forced you to join a huge raiding guild grinding content you never wanted to do in the first place, just to compete in a space you did want to play in.
---
There is a spot in the silo where you can jump up through the roof, which is fake. It is in the room with the broken pipes near a doorway by the terminal that you have to use to restart the reactor.
---
2200 and growing yes
---
And it goes perfectly with the SS jetpack!
---
It‚Äôs a combination of the two yes ...say I run a full health junkies magic weapon vs a bloodied magic weapon the issue is apparent but this dredges up the ongoing debate that low health bloodied meta is long over due for a adjustment idd say take away their stat boosts but keep the damage at least this way they actually have to pay the piper with deaths ...unyielding gone adrenaline gone nerd rage adjusted
---
What the fuck aries!?!?
---
Great roll for a melee. Itd trade/sell
---
Yup! I'm in there lol. JerryKiller in there
---
Looks absolutely amazing welldone man very well done
---
I wanna cz I wont use it
---
I‚Äôd say make sure to spend the 6k a week on buying gold before buying the serum recipe, even though it sounds like you have enough caps to do both. I‚Äôm not sure of what your other in game caps needs are, but if you‚Äôre earning 1400 caps a day, you should be able to cover the 6k weekly gold costs with no problem.
---
Pretty shure they'll just reuse the CC one from FO4 unfortunately.
---
Darn nigh impossible really, understand anyway üëç
---
RangerPlague/F3st3ringplagu3
---
Bugs.
---
There's nothing I hate more than introducing a mechanic or feature and then shortly thereafter abandoning it and forgetting it exists even though there are plenty of things it could be used for.
---
Yeah it generally doesn't say if it is light,sturdy or heavy once it has legendary effects on it since the effects take up all the text real estate.
---
Having a full set of unyeilding is going to benefit you way more than 5 to 10 armor points though.  You can seriously ditch 30 points from DR and ER an never notice a difference once you are over 200 resistance.
---
It means it has tri-barrel mod. Lower fire rate but better range and damage.
---
Thanks, makes sense!
---
If you drop a nuke around the toxic dried lakebed/blackberry lodge/Clarksburg area you can get around 30-50 cobalt flux. Not in the cranberry bog area, but it‚Äôs the right flux
---
I‚Äôm actually a junkie‚Äôs build and I agree with you. The difference in damage between the two was just...overwhelming
---
Season one and public teams.
---
*War never changes.*
---
You sure about that?

https://youtu.be/kAX1-q7loco

I just checked it out. "In Pacifist mode, you can't hurt other players and are choosing not to participate in in PvP (Player versus Player). Other players can still murder you." Yeah wth?
---
Me too.  I have so many of them, I haven't out most in my vendors yet.  Once I clear out some space, I'm gonna slap them all for sale at 25 caps a piece.
---
I wish I could upvote you more than once. You made me spit mountain dew out of my nose laughing.
---
Pro Queen fights occur outside of the blast zone!
---
Yes, just like George Lucas had "Canon" for pre-prequil Star Wars. The exact same, in fact. Both said that they would change canon to fit the story they want to tell.
---
That already happened in Project Paradise and Vault 94
---
Either would be so awesome
---
If you're on PS4, expect at least 45 minute of  
---
"Copying..."
---
Thankyou. Is there anything to pick up though?
---
So its already plausible, i just think it would be cool to have more creature/enemies
---
I love seeing those players, in their PA exoskeletons with no armor pieces because they‚Äôre not even high enough level to equip them, running around with their gas mask, party hat, and hunting rifle.
---
Honestly, if you'd spend the energy you put into tweaking your potato elsewhere you wouldn't need to tweak a potato. Not the answer you seek for, but F76 is playablish on RTX and will definitely be a torture on 1GB GPU
---
Unfortunately no, but I know what you mean.
---
Angry Turtles videos are high quality, entertaining, and gameplay enhancing. Hopefully the FO community can help him achieve full time content creation because I love his content and will miss his daily uploads
---
Not from what I know. 
---
But I‚Äôm not 100%, sorry
---
I hope it comes this update. There's no excuse for not correcting something their fans have bought only to find it useless for over 2 months.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying to max my dps . My current hm is Be 50dr . Trying to see what would be the best third lego affix .
---
See I'm not sure about this cuz I did almost the same but with a pipe pistol and a few rounds given by some nice people back when I was lev 9 ( with this character started new at wastlanders) and I no for a fact I didn't do 1k cuz it was 1 damage per shot and I didn't have that much ammo and I still got a drop and armor for completion maybe lev is involved too?
---
A guy posted that they will be pretty efficient for exchange in the ammo converter. Missile and nuke as well but they are rarer.
---
If only i knew this sooner....
---
I know that if you get that bug that your hp resets you become real tanky but legacy can break threw it
---
Pretty sure there isnt. You get the chinese stealth suit earlier with the settlers instead of a weapon during the raid with the raiders as far as I understand it
---
no, i can tell you exactly how it works. the SBQ has a 70% dmg reduction first, then you start the normal calculations. the sbq has 300 armor so you need to overcome that with armor penetration and damage. with tank killer and perforating magazine that drops her armor to 168. 
---
Armor penetration caps out when the armor is overcome by damage, and that happens at the 6.66% ratio. so you multiply 168 by 6.66 and you get 1,118 raw damage needed to completely ignore the queens armor.
---
sneak attack criticals will put you well into that damage range
---
Bruh, imma do this with my Robert House looking character who‚Äôs a level 15.
---
New players are like a blank canvas, they'll wear almost anything you give them. I've been trying desperately to get the plans for the Halloween skeleton costume so I can make a bunch and keep dropping them for all the new players due to the Steam summer sale, but I keep getting the witch costume instead. My dream is for Appalachia to be crawling with skeletons.
---
I was doing the bush hiding thing to get my ghillie suit and I was in a bush when someone launched a nuke covering the remaining circle. There was 16 players left and I decided to run into the storm, rather die on my own than to that dude‚Äôs nuke. A second before I died in the storm the nuke touched down and the 16 players remaining went to 4. I was in the top 5 because I ran into the storm last second so I got the big XP boost that match. It was awesome.
---
haha i use ultra
---
All heavy builds are pretty much non vats and they're very viable. Just an example.
---
Cool beans, thanks for the info
---
It's escape artist.
---
Even without lifegiver or rejuventanted they can hold strong. Im not after a debate or argument. Just saying you honestly will be surprised how well it works regardless being low health. Try it sometime if you have a bloodied build.
---
Escape artist perk makes you invisible briefly when you crouch.
---
That is old info, they never updated that to reflect the removal of splash damage. 
---
I mean, you can test it yourself. You don't have to believe me.  Literally all you have to do is try it, or not.
---
I would love to see a screenshot of your Mr. House!
---
I mean if you're using that build you could show me. Im on pc
---
Thank you Angry Turtle. Your in depth videos are the best by far. Breaking down the perk cards, weapon, and legendary effects was beyond helpful. Thank you again for being such a positive person in the fallout community.
---
Melons give you significant food and water. It's all I carry and grow.
---
I do regularly against quantum tesla sent/ass spammers. I have no problem holding up. Even against teams. Sure gamma guns can end it pretty quick. But again you would honestly be surprised. With how the comments seemed to be aimed in guessing it's something you haven't experimented with?
---

"If you're selling this, expect items, as trading its value is impractical. If you want to buy such armor, prepare interesting trades worth roughly 41300 - 59400"

---
Also allow us to re-import them from our device, Bethesda suggested I reinstall the game to fix an error, and thus lost my loading screens and character mugshots!
---
VATS is so busted in this you're better off *not* using it. Not only will that give you better practice aiming and being able to fight without the aid of VATS but you won't have to deal with your 95% hits still constantly missing or getting yourself into "bad VATS" in which everything misses.
---
The only way I can use it effectively in the endgame is to focus my build on it, and instead of VATS being like a cool, simple MMO targeting feature I have to run Concentrated Fire 3 and bank on my first few shots missing but the perk to upgrade my accuracy anyway as I spend all my AP to get a couple shots to even land. I was using Critical Savvy and Better Criticals, but unlike FO4 crits apparently aren't guaranteed hits, because most of those were missing too.
---
Dude, I hate griefers. I've been downvoted to oblivion because of statements like, "Griefers should get banned", etc. But it's a true fact that if you're running around without pacifist, you're going to have bad time, unless you're a PvP player (even then I'd imagine).  
---
I think Pacifist should be automatic. At the very least there should be a HUGE warning as soon as you hit level 5 about how it works now.
---
I‚Äôm on now, MagicRedApple
---
Trust me mate, it‚Äôll get way easier later. I can run through a nuke silo in 10 to 15 minutes on PS4 as a stealth commando. At a later date you‚Äôll run through a silo and wonder ‚ÄúHow did I have so much trouble with this?‚Äù
---
(Not saying what that dude did was right though. That dude was a total knob jockey for stealing a nuke from someone else, a lower level to boot.)
---
Well not really, Two Shot was never nerfed cus of PVP  
---
It was nerfed cus of Co-Op gameplay which is actually the only thing alive in this game now so un-nerfing TS would stupid of them
---
I just want to say my first useable bloodied dropped. A 3 star Bloodied Ultracite Gatling laser.
---
But what else can we do when we start a dick measuring contest and find out we don't measure up?
---
I always do on PlayStation. I have to load another game first, play a few minutes then I can play fallout. Otherwise I get infinite blue screens
---
Why did he go back to his job

That should be him right there. Made him a couple of days ago!
---
I like trap bases.  Creative ones anyways.
---
Nice.
---
It loads then takes me back to the Xbox Dashboard.
---
Then I tried loading up something else n it still refused
---
A Two Shot FFR Auto Grenade Launcher is great for taking out groups. I need 40mm all the time to feed mine.
---
Jeez, I wasn't expecting to see a perfect Synth of the guy. That's absolutely amazing. Nice job!
---
Not on pc sadly. Just run a standard bloodied build. I run 1 bolst and 4 uny when out of pa. in pa with emergency protocols. Enjoy freedom of movement. Don't have to be so worried of staggers out of sent/ass. Allowed to move and use cover. Have my perks working on my side out of pa with a huge ap pool for dodgy. EP working to tank out in pa. Again it's not about stating that it's the be all and end all. However it holds up surprisingly well against the normal junkies quantum chugging stealth boy builds. Honestly give it a go.
---
You might run into him if you play on Ps4! I‚Äôll be on 76 this evening.
---
All day every day
---
There's alot of rare junk in the vault raid that is hard to get like a wabbler hair brush and flower vase etc. Not sure if it's dependant who you do the vault raid with though.. And yeah the outfit reward and slug buster from raiders.
---
Holy shit.
---
Agreed! I can't believe I'm also doing it on an alt. LOL
---
its not too terrible for accuracy. i just use it until shit gets real, then pull out the big toys.
---
Always ... Apart from the mounted SBQ head once. Usually 1* armour.
---
What you spent...minutes fixing will probably take them weeks of scratching their heads
---
I would like that a lot. My junkies explosive CR is amazing.
---
Worst case you could do a hard restart. That usually solves a few problems
---
Wow so that's why I go invisible for a moment in crouch lol. Well that answers that.
---
Combat rifle right? If so, nice one :)
---
Damn, should i trade it?
---
Do u have healing factor
---
Tried that but its refused to load but works fine on other discs
---
Its caused by healing factor mutation
---
I personally love the nuke mechanic. Differentiates NW from other battle royales
---
Ok, sent you a message.
---
You don‚Äôt need heavy for the polished mod.  Make the cheapest material (light arm) and scrap away.  You‚Äôll eventually unlock mods for all 3... weights?
---
Let me go turn mine on and see if there any issues or if it's just you
---
It works that way? I feel pretty dumb...
---
They used to only drop from signal strength quest I believe, then Christmas presents came along. You can normally find them now in player vending or in random bags at WS.
---
Yea it rips through enemies
---
Where on steam do you see both packs for $18? I only see them being sold separately for $12 each
---
Bwa ha ha who wants to live forever eh?
---
Reminds me of my first scorched earth, I was level under level 10 I think, wearing a power armor frame and a some kinda pipe gun. All I saw on the map was a public event, thought it was another easy event like in the forest so I fast traveled to it. Died several times, kept respawning in the nuke zone and dying again over and over before it finally spawned me outside of it. Everybody else killed it through so I ended up getting the trophy for scorched earth.
---
Cool, can‚Äôt wait to really get a grip of the junkies concept so I can try this gun out
---
I‚Äôm also trying to just get some non legendary to supplement my gear while I get a set
---
I would trade it, cos I don't PVP.  
---
But considering all the neckbeard backlash against PVP (read as: griefing) being "nerfed" they might change PVP to be more viable and that could make it worth more. So holding onto it is an okay decision, too.
---
Either way, if you trade something that valuable make sure to use r/market76 so you have the in-house reputation system and blacklist as a safety net.
---
Did her body have loot on it? There's no damage requirement for completing the quest which rewards a legendary piece of combat armor some flux and repair kits.
---
Happened to me yesterday and I‚Äôm a level 60 lol.
---
Character 1: Red asylum uniform, red asylum hat, red responder eyepatch and a red responder backpack. 
---
Character 2: Mostly a power armor user equipped with the shadow prime skin. However outside of power armour I'm wearing forest camo jumpsuit, secret service backpack, urban scout mask. Sometimes I switch up wearing stalkers outfit, medical goggles, raider pathfinder mask and mothman goggles with the secret service backpack.
---
I was able to log in and load into a public server with no issues
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can make you one.

I tend to get three star stuff but it‚Äôs always script.

I‚Äôve had better luck getting stuff from the imposter sheep.
---
Oh god stop I am getting triggered. Too real and too soon. #waterwheelgate.
---
Doesn't really matter, since 76 is supposed to be the earliest Fallout game and exploring mutations that were short-lived due to natural selection taking effect and killing them off.  Spiders could very much be a thing, no Fallout game has explored them yet though.
---
well if that is the case then that explains why I never had that problem..
---
Wait how did he not die to the radiation, you get so much if you have no protection
---
As long as I have my Liberty Prime power armor I don't give a damn if Joe or Carl hits level cap first, and neither should you. The game is made to be fun and relaxing.
---
Woah woah woah, whats a wabbler hair brush and this vase you speak of
---
Thanks for the offering but that‚Äôs ok!
---
Yes
---
Commando? There‚Äôs a reason everyone goes for B2525. B2515 is still decent, but against bosses, using (almost) no AP for the endless headshot crits is king.
---
They gave us a hat as well??? Whaaaaa
---
Come to think of it, I haven't seen a single grognaks axe drop from any mob since wastelanders, either.
---
YES! I've had to screenshot all my photos onto my xbox a couple times... and now I dont get to see them as loading screens anymore...
---
Concept is easy, get addicted to 5 things, slap on powerful automatic receiver and max out commando perks.
---
Drifter Outfit &amp; Mining Helmet &amp; Gas Mask &amp; Black Shovel Backpack. Complete survivalist / scavenger style.
---
No clue then
---
We were all fighting the queen on the edge of the radiation zone.
---
I guess nerfing it to the ground was smart and never bringing it back is smart too ?
---
I dont even think about plan rarity so I woudnt know.. I learn them or I drop them if known..
---
never got a weapon from a SBQ that I didnt scrip right after the event...
---
I think I need building tips then üòÇ I have walls and benches and it eats up my budget oddly
---
What drives me slightly insane is that when the Brotherhood returns going forward, there'll be expeditions, presumably outside Appalachia.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why couldn't Blue Ridge have done that?
---
tons of people get the stacks of plans by finding a bag a whitespring with 20 of each mounted head and then they go put it all in their vending machine.
---
Nothing ever
---
I'd love this!
---
they removed the scrip from presents.
---
I don't run full bloody at all , I keep my health over half full. I made a bffr gauss mini gun. It is a really fun weapon.
---
I wish you could choose different races in the fallout game, choose different factions, so you could be a Ghoul if you wanted, or a supermutant, or Human and choose a raider faction.
---
Here is to hoping. Unfortunately my stores of cautious optimism ran out right around the time they disabled player vending for two weeks.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm commando . I started with wastelanders so I don‚Äôt have any amazing trades yet to get a b25/25 figured the next achievable gun for me is a be15 or b25 something .
---
I love how you live in a bubble where you think everyone else cheats as much as you do. I mean, its sad, but its still funny.
---
Fallout 1,2,3 or New Vegas seasons would be dope
---
Whats the story about Angry Turtle? Not enough support?
---
What are you talking about? I‚Äôve never deleted any ‚Äî I must have like 800 or something
---
Loved it!! Ugh I wish I was on xbox would've loved to visit
---
I mean, the effect itself isn't so bad now when you look at it. It's one of the few only useful main effects on weapons rn. Sure it is like the weakest useful effect but it's not as trash as 3/4 other main effects
---
I got a tse galling laser that meets her pretty fast.
---
I guess I need to watch videos. Playing since wasteland release and all my gear is still crap
---
Agreed I got the ammo maker and just cant do any more ward quests. Its so slooooooowwww.
---
That's very informative...I wonder what I can use that for.  Thanks!
---
Is b2590%wep weight the poor mans b2525 ? How much does the wep weight reduction translate to ap reduction ?
---
I usually get trash from the wendigo colossus
---
I now call all dogs 'doggos' whether in game or IRL.
---
At one point i was one of those people while everyone else was ussing melee i was just shotgunning scorched in the face

I saw a level one in excavator in front of vault 76 last week too, was soo confused I took a screenshot

"Why do I need 109837409178239087109237409123094 GB of free space for an update??"
---
Thanks so much for the tips! This is super helpful! Are you on Xbox?
---
I think its different on xbox, unless schorched enemies count towards damage done I've done under 100 damage and got her body loot
---
I'm competiting to be last and you can't stop me
---
Winner! Winner! Chicken dinner!

Constantly.

---
On that note, does anyone know where his accent is from? I've never seen it mentioned. My S.O. and I love it and sometimes talk along with him during his videos because it's so damn great. But I can't rightly place it!
---
While we're on the subject of disappointing hat stuff. I got the Grandfather Winter power helmet. That's cool in itself and all but it was level 15 so kinda useless. But it said I could craft it! So I scrapped the one I had to craft a new one. And guess what!? I can't craft it. So.... if someone could fix that that would be super cool.
---
I absolutely love that all the room are different height and all that too it‚Äôs awesome I do camp builds on YouTube and couldn‚Äôt imagine doing something like this you should send it in to one of those camp spotlight yotubers
---
That is the funniest shit ever.
---
yup, i [modded it in](https://imgur.com/a/gxWnb9l) once (replaced gray wool cap model with wrapped cap), but an update reversed my changes and i never got around to doing it again
---
that being said, it should 100% be possible in the base game, along with the fact that hooded rags still can't be worn over regular armor
---
yes
---
yeah, in creation kit it's the equivalent of unchecking a check box
---
This feels closer to the truth than most of the arguments I've read. I get a serious "closed writers room" vibe from the devs whenever they come out of their corporate shielding to make any public statements. There are a number of examples where they accidentally betray how little they actually listen to the community and even when they do, they add extra steps for no reason like with the [ammo converter](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2rv1h/please_let_us_convertbreak_down_ammo/). Another couple of things that irked me were when they were demoing the colossus fight and the devs playing....sucked....really badly. Not just not being elite meta boys, but just super bad. That and when they said text chat wasn't a hotly requested feature made me go....wait really?
---
Tool the Collosus down a couple of times and was rather underwhelmed with the rewards. The third time I farmed the Glowing Wendigos she spawns for screws instead.
---
Yep, and often
---
It's very creative. I'm impressed with how you got it into that location. I'm not sure about the fireplace in the kitxhen area. You could use it in a sitting area instead, maybe.  What's your camp budget look like after it was done? Still,  it's a very interesting camp design and you have a right to be proud of it.
---
Ah thanks for the info
---
Ok, thanks!
---
ha
---
Building was heavily streamlined from Fallout 4.  Chances are it has to do with making sure players can't get *too* complicated with what they can build, and having restrictions probably makes it easier for enemies to path into your structures.
---
There was definitely an effort to make sure that players can't build a structure NPCs can't traverse.  That's why we have invisible ramps on foundations and every floor needs a snapped staircase or else it's not legal.
---
It sucks really, and it sucks more they cut so much workshop stuff from Fallout 4.
---
At one point ESO had only about 200 players on Steam, now it has about 20,000.
---
Oh yeah I remember how easy it was to just jump into CK and manually fix stuff like this in a minute. Pitty we don't have that ability in this one. Imo by now they could have released a part of 76's esm that we could modify without fear of breaking the game.
---
Think of it as a sanctioned part of the esm, simple stuff like the biped slots you mentioned, facegen or body edit for tweaking characters' appearances, cosmetic-only things that we can modify to our liking if you catch my drift. We can already modify visuals but we are strictly limited to texture and mesh replacers generally. 
---
This way the modders can easily create unofficial patches fixing the game's visual glitches and bugs, even uploading it to a particular site for the devs to thoroughly check themselves and release to the public. Sounds like a win-win!
---
Wait, what I've only ever had Aries and Rudy. I haven't run it a ton of times but I've ran it around ten times and it's always Aries and Rudy I didn't know there were other people.
---
Same here. No option
---
Verily, good knight, thou hast done as thou deem‚Äôd best, with new honor to thine blood and crest.
---
From what I remember the vault raids were atrociously buggy and extremely anti-fun. I never went back after my buddies and I wasted about 50k ammo and then all got dced for seemingly no reason. Did they ever become consistently stable?
---
&gt; Games generating revenue in this model will shift to whims of the base.
---
Doesn't seem like they are following whims imo. It seems like they are adding what things they agree with internally (which happens to be very little), and then tacking on revenue systems to anything that makes it through while somehow simultaneously adding a ton of new bugs and not fixing old ones. "The team has this on their radar" should be the slogan for Fallout 76.
---
I was given it by a level 100 when I was only like level 15. That‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve been able to find it
---
I feel attacked LMAO xD
---
So, uhh, cave crickets not enough for you?
---
Mod support in what capacity? There are a number of extremely well done mods that are updated frequently on nexusmods such as text chat.
---
Thats a really great turnaround. I've heard good things about ESO, you think its worth a try?
---
God please. I have both and would love to wear them without looking like a naked mole rat coming out of a hole.
---
Cries in assassin‚Äôs rolling pin and instigating shovel...
---
AFAIK, it doesn‚Äôt. The weapons have a base AP that‚Äôs loosely related to their weight, but the legendary effect doesn‚Äôt change that.
---
Insurgent armour - Secret service helmet - small backpack | Grognak King armour - Gladiator helmet | padded blue jacket - marine armour helmet | Treasure hunter clothes - one of the sack masks

(I have a lot more)
---
Lol im talking big like mothman/honeybeast size maybe bigger
---
Look at the math first. HM and CSA both give 1000 RR. If someone can ignore a step and be just as well protected, they'll be fine.
---
I‚Äôd really like to know the metrics and how it scales if anyone knows the answer
---
I was told he is Polish on stream?

I don't know what you're talking about. Not at all. No bug here.

---
That's pretty awesome! I run a loft too, but it's massively ghetto compared to yours.

And I'll do you one better. Gamebryo used to be called NetImmerse. And Morrowind was created with that one. So yeah, it's a realy Frankenstein's monster with how heavily it's been changed over the years.  Which really makes me fear for Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI.
---
At 19% health is you maximum benefit and when nerd rage should kick in if you are using it
---
For fucks sake, I struggle budget wise with a simple house (with small loft bedroom), an attached garage/workshop, and a shed for generator(s)/camp module. And here you are with a freaking skyscraper. Have pity on us plebeian caveman engineers.
---
Interesting toy say that. Given some of Grahms phrases, it does seem like someone interacted with him earlier in life and helped him change so to speak. "A smart man once said grahm find what you like,"etc. I've always thought someone didnt necessarily make him, but helped change him.
---
Yeah there's like x3 rare junk items you can only get from in there. Good if you are a junk collector and like to display it i guess. The hair brush looks no different to the normal one, it just gives you more junk when you scrap it and has a different name eg.
---
Is it supposed to be the black ski mask?
---
Any luck?
---
Yeah but bloatflies are plentiful, they wouldn‚Äôt have mutated or gotten so big had spiders been around to keep them in check
---
A 5%damage boost for every 5% health lost
---
can you play with someone on steam if the other person is on bethesda?
---
Yes. It was the black ski mask or balaclava that you see the raiders wearing at crater etc. to match the Mountain scout outfit.
---
Same here I‚Äôm assuming this is for console
---
I think all the old presents from last year should just get the atom shop label, so they can't be dropped traded or transferred, limiting people to only using them on their mule accounts and making them overall a pain in the butt to continue abusing. I doubt that by this point anyone who earned them legit at the event still has many kicking around.
---
Where do I sign up to be a child of Goris?
---
That‚Äôs really cool. I like how tall it looks when you use all half walls like that.
---
Yeah. Smartie told him those things. Follow Grahm for awhile and you‚Äôll learn all of the philosophy he learned from Smartie. Who is Smartie? That I do not know.
---
This mutation caused the bug for me. Might be worth waiting until patch 20 before considering removing the mutation though
---
Remember seeing a fresh dweller try to meele the queen once....then she made her wing sweep and he went flying all over the bunker
---
I don't get how it can work for NPCs bit not players
---
Wherever their main encampments is.
---
He has a real job
---
Had no idea this was a thing. I‚Äôd grind so bad to get this outfit if the mask was compatible.
---
Right!?! And it's still in the Atomic store on Ps4 but without an image and you can tag it to wear in Nuclear Winter but when the match loads you are stripped of all headwear.. It's broken.
---
There are alot of of things stacking. Adrenal reaction gives you a extra percentage nerdrage gives you some extra damage. without the perks and adrenal reaction  its e extra 5 percent for every 5 percent you lose on hp
---
Other than flux, yeah. I do make some pretty good caps from the queen mounted plan but that‚Äôs really it. Wish there was more but I look at that event as an XP boost and somewhat legendary (from the other scorched) hunt.
---
I haven't tried to tag it but is there with no image on xbox as well
---
Whaaat? This troubleshooter‚Äôs lead pipe says other wise.
---
I think there are three different combinations. It's random, which is nice. Different dialogue keeps it fresh.
---
There's a bullion cap?
---
Gamebryo used to be called NetImmerse which was used to create Morrowind. So it's even more of a Frankenstein's monster then you thought. And I'm not hopeful at all for Starfield and ES VI. Well at least you can count on modders to fix their shit in those games unlike FO76.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they added the enclave plasma 2 that enclave list. I want a legendary one so damn bad. I love your idea a lot.
---
That assumes all spiders would eat are flies when there a many different types of spiders, not all of them spin webs, and not all of them primarily hunt flying insects.  West Virginia actually happens to possess some ground-dwelling spiders that don't spin webs, and hunt more round-dwelling prey.
---
Crazy I didn‚Äôt even realize that man. They better fix that, it looks really cool.
---
That might be a bit of an issue lol.
---
Yeah ! Love the lines, makes it seem that grahm could have a little background questline haha.
---
What‚Äôs the limit?
---
Understood. And I will DESTROY you. 
---
(kidding)
---
Are you on PC?
---
Nope
---
Can confirm it also works for me during the playing of the animation. Truth be told though I bought it for the animation and cause it looks cool, not like water is hard to come by.
---
I definitely prefer him over a certain condescending, Aussie, prick YouTuber. Turtle is hard not to like.
---
No üò≠
---
hahaha.
---
1* Berserkers Pool Cue
---
If they release a pack of just different kinds of stairs that shit will sell like hot cakes
---
Damn that sucks. I really don't know what to do to fix it
---
I think his accent is more Scandinavian than polish. But could be wrong. Sweden or Finland maybe
---
Rage, bitter disappointment, the usual.
---
The primary thing I've noticed is that certain guns are really really bad like the fat man and flamer and that the degradation speed changes patch to patch. Same with hunger/thirst right now it seems to be hyperdraining your bars.
---
Ima try uninstall n reinstall
---
Xbox here.  Same issue.  Its been like this for 6+ weeks for me.
---
The same reason you get missiles every time you clear a silo
---
What is splash damage? It's just that the description makes it sound like your removing the ability to defend yourself as opposed to eliminating the ability for others to attack you.
---
Ammo factory?
---
That's seems a bit extreme
---
Chance of losing my stuff?
---
At the ammo factory and the bog town workshops, I think Berkeley can spawn sb too for defend event.
---
I've seen it done in seconds with the right combination of legendary armor, chems, bobblehead, minimum health etc. and a bloodied limb damage big gun before the gauss weapons were added as well. Once they got their gauss minigun bloodied limb damage roll, it was queen melter 2: electric boogaloo. I'm sure the bugs involved don't *only* apply to bloodied, but it is glaringly obvious with a good bloodied stack.
---
Yeah pretty common in the Mire especially. It‚Äôs up to YOU. Forget your turrets.
---
From my experience a few hits on an enemy grant loot lol
---
One that takes a flux you don't use for ammo that a lot of people use. I got the speed demon recipe because it's popular and uses yellow flux which I have no use for. All my ammo is violet or of one we get a good gauss minigun crimson. Some popular ones are marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction, scaly skin,
---
Can you give me evidence of change in mutant eating habits in animals?
---
‚ÄúAngrey Tartahl‚Äù

Its because the exploaive laser rifle is alot more powerfull than your handmade your handmade hurts you to
---
Having fun playing the game normally and being happy when I encounter a legendary enemy.
---
Dross toss
---
Beautiful! How do you do the pillar thing??
---
I popped in when I saw two level 40-somethings trying to launch a nuke.
---
I helped them clear the silo and prep, then watched them burn 6 nuke cards because they didn‚Äôt have the code.
---
He has said multiple times that he is originally from poland but lives in the UK.
---
That‚Äôs a thing. I use dense mod on chest armor and Fireproof 3 perk and STILL it doesn‚Äôt always save me. Eventually learned to swap out at a certain distance.
---
I mean, maybe they'll be involved and their inclusion into Wastelanders was to set up for expeditions. Wishful thinking, but it is possible
---
The real loot was the friends you made along the way. Also, the flux.
---
Sorry you're right I forgot every video on the internet in existence is fake for reasons. My bad sorry about that it slipped my memory! 
---
Except you literally can? Downloading the game doesn't change the fact its always online and multiplayer (if you're a SP person) or that the questing is crap together and the game's co-op is poorly done (if you're a MP person). It doesn't change the fact the game is ultra casual to the point where even it's basic survival needs may as well not exist for all the impact they have. It doesn't change the fact there were literally no NPC's before wastelanders. It doesn't change the fact the game IS a buggy mess for most people because Bethesda refuses to use a new engine or at least patch in fixed modded code. It doesn't change the fact the game has been one non stop bad PR nightmare of hilarity and regularly has features disabled because it's so easily hacked. It doesn't change the fact the game both looks and runs like complete ass (I can run a 500 mod fallout 4 that looks 16x better than 76 with no issues but can barely get above 30 FPS on 76). It doesn't change the fact the game is pretty content bare and relies on artificially stifling player progression with extremely low caps for endgame currency. It doesn't change the fact FO1st exists and the scrapbox which Bethesda claimed could not be added because it would break the server is behind a insane subscription paywall. It doesn't change the fact the game is lacking some of the most basic features known to video games such as a text chat. You can learn all of that and MUCH MORE very easily, without ever having to download the game (well aside from the performance area within reason). Ever. 
---
Unless you're a brain dead baboon that literally has no self awareness and no idea what you like or dislike or will or will not be bothered by you can pretty easily judge what your personal experience might look like. It's like how usually all you need to do is read a plot description and watch a trailer or two to get a pretty good idea of whether you'll enjoy a movie or not. 
---
Fallout 76 is not some super deep game with a unique experience you literally HAVE to play to understand. At all. And that's merely your opinion Fallout 76's issues have been overstated. I don't see how factually reporting a fact can be "overstated" in any way but so be it. Your opinion doesn't make those very real issues go away. A lot of them have gone away NOW after some developer work. Lots of them, most of them, also still haven't.
---
Eat about 3 honey and then jetpack over to the tall launch silo. If you don't make it, try to land on pipes/conduits.
---
Agreed. Always disappointed (or have wasted a lot of time server hopping) otherwise.
---
Thats because they werent doing enough damage to take agro from the DPS lead, but was a gutsy move for sure! :)
---
Stop talking about this. Seriously. They love fixing the good bugs.
---
It's like that for almost everything in the game but at least on PC you have to do enough damage to the queen or you get nothing.
---
That's fair I don't use them, and the one time I tried the flame it broke decently fast forgot about it lol. The water and food have been a massive issue for me. Afk for 10 minutes and I'm fully out sometimes.
---
Red rocket would occasionally make you defend against scorch beasts.
---
I‚Äôve had 2 even at Dabney Homestead.
---
Interesting, i must test this on Xbox
---
Event hop, but I shall play normally. I start every session by clearing out whitespring and then west-Tek. That‚Äôs normally 3-5 legendary items, then event hop whilst completing dailies. Best event I‚Äôve found is Uranium Fever, providing you get the people in the event that allow you get to shots in on the legendary enemies
---
Commenting to see what answer comes through here
---
I dont think they are adding any more. At least Im pretty sure they didnt expressly say so. Having said that I think they snuck at least one new one in the last update because Im pretty sure the "Complete 19 Daily Quests" one is new. There may be some others I havent noticed. So who knows. We may get some new ones dribbled in here and there
---
No just might take a while
---
One of the main things that I like about Turtle is that he goes against the grain.  He questions all the established "Wisdom" and tests everything.  He explains why some cards and mods sound uber cool and actually do nothing.  He says Excavator PA is the best, and backs it up, uses all the food build/weight perk cards, and makes it all work to perfection.  I gave up second guessing him and added it all to my build.  I've never been happier with a loadout.
---
1400 caps sold to vendors each day
---
It‚Äôs the other possibility
---
I watch that youtuber when I want to laugh at a drunk guy who is cussing about all the same things that I cuss about in game.  He is all about max damage though, Turtle is more QOL and efficiency.
---
Yeah, I mean, I usually do dailies or events, so I'm usually getting scrip or treasury notes, plus a legendary or two, but I do try and visit different places I haven't been for a while. I went to Huntersville for the first time in a long time the other day and got some nice stuff.
---
They were a loot drop from the Miners Pails that came from the Treasure Hunt event a month or so ago. There is also some in circulation from previous duping exploits using duped Holiday Gifts and Pails ince they shared the same loot pool
---
Ahh. That's a strange item for the effort needed most of the time &amp; risk.
---
I jumped into a queen fight today and for the first time used my junkies minigun.  It is only 2 star, junkies/explosive.   It seemed to do a ton of damage,  is this what is being talked about in this post, or does the gun have to have the limb damage perk.  The queen died on its second landing.
---
Because we aren't all members of his Patreon.  It is all our fault LOL.  Poor guy has to eat.
---
The gifts that keep coming. So to speak
---
DUPERS. Just say it. It‚Äôs such a joke, I see them in dropped loot bags everywhere I go.
---
Haha yep.
---
When I did it a few days ago I got a couple of waves of dogs. And some mole rats.
---
Anytime your health is increasing due to aid, armor or perks it will not let you fast travel.
---
Or how about getting nothing at all when you know you've got plenty of shots in?
---
Yeah probably
---
Yeah, it pretty much puts all the other +AP perks to shame.
---
I had a choice between a jetpack which I consider a novelty or CA, and I went with CA.
---
I took off jetpack, completely did not miss it after the first hour or so.
---
I took off CA and I was pining for it and couldn't live without it. Watching AP regen twice as fast is just so much better because I like to sprint a lot. 
---
It also makes dodgy very tolerable.
---
Because explosive energy weapons were buggy, that is why they became legacy.
---
Now if they were to fix them with the upcoming weapon balance sweep....  well the cries will be heard planet-wide.
---
Where do you get the Rad ant lager recipe?
---
Dross: Tossed
---
I‚Äôm with you on this one Bethesda need to fix the wrapped cap. I want to be able to wear mask or eyeglasses!!!!
---
Man you hit the nail on the head.  I don't think I've ever seen him get angry. Even when things happen to him that would make my head explode.
---
Place is just not worth it.  Even with a few dogs.
---
The guy clearly hates Fallout 76 and only plays it because that's his only audience. Turtle on the other hand seems to be genuinely having a great time. It makes for a much better watch.
---
Muahahahaha cant wait
---
It's the same on PS4. You have to do around 1-2k in damage for the queen to drop loot.
---
Scorpionflies AKA Stingwings are something a bit more known for being scavengers and opportunistic feeders than being completely straight predators, though it is something they are capable of. And they also grew stingers despite not actually possessing that.
---
I'm not saying they are all fake, I am saying they are all subjective. Lots of people love the game and do not worry about the issues you are describing. And maybe you wouldn't either if you gave it a shot. Hopefully you can appreciate how online content creators are incentivised to dramatise and overstate the topics they cover. Most of the shit that matters on the internet doesn't matter in real life. 
---
I can see how someone might think the above are game breaking if they had just gone by the online coverage. But you have to acknowledge that this isn't the experience of many people who have played the game, and they know better than someone who hasn't played because their experience is literally their experience. They are 100% accurate on the topic of whether they would personally enjoy the game or not because they have done the experiment and have the results.
---
I can see how you aren't getting it though so maybe let's agree to disagree.
---
I found a bag at WSS which had about 100 copies of every Christmas even plan....I dumped them into Fissure Site Prime.
---
Exactly. And I get it, they're Bethesda developers, not playtesters. But there's something to be said for staying in touch with your game's meta and the community of an online game like this. The fact that we're only just now getting a PTS is embarrassing, and the fact that very little is being changed with the feedback from it is even worse. They did hear the complaints about legendary perks, but that's only because this subreddit was filled with those complaints for days on end. And that would be nice, but from what I've heard, they aren't even changing the perks, they're just changing how we earn them.
---
I love this game, and have seen it go through a lot. It really feels like the game is on a set course at this point: The devs push out half-baked content, like Treasure Hunter or patches that somehow break atom shop items, and then focus 100% on the next half-baked release, rather than fixing or improving on anything already there. Nuclear Winter is another great example there- they've done events where you can earn items in it, sure, but it's still the same hack/glitch filled mess it was on day one. Seriously, the only thing they haven't broken yet is Fallout 1st- oh wait, they [did that too](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpclks/fallout_1st_broke/).
---
Lolz nice choice.
---
They are a bit product of the xmas gift dupe.
---
Not sure if you can do privates but I usually nuke Whitespring and I can run it 3x and then a quick run for flux. Did it today and got enough scrip for 2 characters and about 40 stable flux. If you can‚Äôt  do private then my go to is starting at the top right bye Fearhouse and walk the way to the Glass Caverns and I always come across multiple encounters also do horde events always 3* boss
---
Lmao
---
I *hope*
---
It‚Äôs the same in Xbox.
---
Source: I started a new character recently and couldn‚Äôt get any loot from the SBQ until around level 30ish.
---
I see
---
I don't even think we'll get atoms outside of the 150 at each 10 ranks... But less ways to earn atoms means less atoms being spent in the long run. It does look like there will be a smaller focus on the atom shop though. Itll hopefully be more discounted Greatest Hits &amp; Special Offers which is fine by me.
---
I always just jump over the counter and stand in front of them
---
sorry I didn't answer your question about it being worse than bloodied weapons.
---
I can tell you from experience that a bloodied build does a LOT more damage than junkies. I have a non-FFR bloodied LMG and that thing absolutely shreds.
---
However, I don't consider damage to be the end-all and be all. I switched to a high health build because I want to solo whatever tough content comes next.
---
I am having way more fun playing a balanced build, still shredding things (without the bug) and not dying randomly to bugs such as well-fed dropping off and instantly dying.
---
Or constantly trying to balance rads at 10-20% health in a rad zone.
---
Or a snallygaster gets the drop on you and instantly melts you with its acid/poison attack.
---
Streaming is a real job :(
---
Did you just leak the Inside the Vault???
---
Dross Boss
---
I haven't been playing long but I have a pretty serious hoarding problem when it comes to videos games like this...now my bad habits are about to pay off lol

Fissure Site Prime makes a great disposal area for that duped crap.
---
The plans shouldn‚Äôt be common, they are all ultracite afaik. The pure flux is really the reason for doing the event though. And the advanced repair kits.
---
Begone demon!
---
That pack... i thought I'd get a log cabin building set... The water wheel still doesn't move...
---
I legit only use the fire pit and wallpapers lmaoooooo
---
Was the hat actually in the photo when they advertised the free outfit? I didn‚Äôt remember it being there. I was under the impression that the bug was them showing a hat in the shop
---
who is that
---
Doubtful.  It‚Äôs a safe bet Zenimax has put the kibosh on all the free atoms that flow from the game.  12 weeks of atoms was in the neighborhood of 7000 atoms.  That‚Äôs $70. Now were getting 1500 in that rough tjmespan (10 week season and ~2 dead weeks).
---
It took longer for FO76Edit to open the .esm than it did to track down the form IDs (just shy of 4 minutes, vs Fallout 4's .esm taking 10 seconds), and you'd be floored by the amount of errors it displayed.
---
seriously though! dude seems cool af
---
Living his best life.
---
Probably completed 150+ Queens and have had 1 keeper!!! FE15 Handmade... I usually get a 1* pipe from then the queen and and a 2* Armor for the event both trash
---
Wow that‚Äôs really good!
---
Right now it‚Äôs all RNG, there‚Äôs no go-to spot any more. All the go-to spots are nerfed and guaranteed spawns are mostly low levels.
---
Dude, that is PERFECT.
---
What does the last one say?
---
it's not even an awful amount of work. It's literally just getting killed by someone with a legacy energy weapon, which thanks to the dupers, are all over the place. People are now abusing it to kill the SBQ in seconds, and now folks realize how easy it is to make the exploit, any tom, dick and mary can stack up psychobuff and go on a tear, griefing.
---
The Woox of Fallout 76.
---
Happened to me. I ran up the stairs to the roof and had clear line on the beasts while the scorched continues moaning on the ground below. Was a fun fight.
---
Last one says 'youporn'
---
I‚Äôm sorry but what god damned universe do *you* live in? Perception. Increases the accuracy and range in VATS. Charisma. Better vendor prices without drugs or perks. Intelligence. Extra XP. Agility. Increases AP and sneak. Luck. Affects crit recharge rate. Unyielding offers many benefits that even a casual gamer should realise.
---
üò®üò®üò® shhhhhh
---
I can verify this.  I log off and back on after a couple hours to refresh the server.
---
Has It even worked?
---
I am rocking the marine tactical and BoS officer suit and like the combined look with the SS armor.  I don't think even this modest change you're suggesting would get *me* to buy the SS Helm, but IT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD CHANGED and the price should be dropped too while Beth is tinkering with it.
---
My only gun that seems to be doing any kind of damage is my shotgun.  So it was a good place to farm shells. 
---
Waves of dogs are way easier to kill than 2 schorchbeasts though.
---
No, thanks! Had some bugs in game and now all my armor has vanished. Well rip. And yeah, I wasn't enjoying the premise of bloodied too much. But I randomly stumbled on the junkies bug and took advantage of it. I will give your build a try, thanks for info!
---
This is the way.
---
I was wondering about that myself, I've had the wrapped cap in my stash since the first week of launch, it always makes me laugh to put it on. It was my pseudo power armor helmet for a good while', but it made my facial hair vanish and I'd just look so.. Off.
---
I personally watched Grahm beat the crap out of a legendary scorchbeast with his tenderizer just south of the whitespring.  He is fearless.  I also saw a video on YT, possibly Rifle Gaming, where they lured the Wendigo Colossus into a fight with Grahm.. and no kidding the Colossus ended up running away near death.  Grahm chased him down and finished him off.
---
why was text body removed?
---
Person standing outside of a building? Could be anything.
---
They aren't that hard to kill.
---
Well that shit ain‚Äôt cool. As his friend I say fuck him and don‚Äôt do it lol.
---
The Exorcist, but the wrong time of day and weather?
---
Idk but Veteran Oufit with Mountain Scout Uniform and that they both got released the same day and were in Atom store with no other outfit sets but the oufit was craftable but the hat never was eg Insurgent Oufit set with hat, Wasteland Trapper with hat, Nuka girl with hat, Daredevil with hat and most other outfit sets i can think of come with a hat.. suggests to me that it was always intended but has been broken since release. That's why i started this thread to find out why we still have this ski mask balaclava that says mountain scout i think in atomic store but is unusable and was never for sale?
---
if everything is dead there's no need to sneak =0
---
You absolutely do not need covert operative. 100% don't need it. And you could probably lose Concentrated fire as well. 
---
Am i to assume you don't have a gauss shotty yet. You're gonna be one shotting most things as it is. Exceptions are SBQ, some scorchbeasts, and the project paradise alpha creature.. and that's about it. Oh and the odd random like.. level 35 any which needs to hits even though you just one shot the level 91 glowing deathclaw it was fighting.
---
Eh, he's a certain disgruntled captain I'd rather not put on blast here. Just imagine a guy that would rather be playing  ANYTHING but Fallout 76 but is forced to in order to hold onto what he perceives as "fame".
---
Pretty sure you get missiles in the silo to make sure over encumbered so you can‚Äôt fast travel and see the nuke drop lol
---
I'm not particularly high level and it seems like none of my guns do any damage other than my shotgun.
---
It was a bad decision on my part haha
---
Maybe by lowlife they mean junkies?
---
No country for old man? Could really be many movies lol
---
Bro can you just tell me who he is, nobody's gonna sue you for saying it.
---
The photo when they said ‚Äúyou get this veteran outfit‚Äù didn‚Äôt include a mask/hat. I‚Äôm guessing the hat showing in the shop is the bug. Nobody would have expected it since it wasn‚Äôt advertised to us. Just my two cents..
---
Jees,...CaptainNoob.
---
if you just want scrip do the horde events. quick and easy. 
---
You can also NOT kill the horde boss and more enemies turn up to protect it. And you can just farm them as well. The yogi bear one is good as you get acid and springs.
---
Yeppers!!
---
All about the flux for me...200 caps isn‚Äôt too bad either
---
It has nothing to do with the mounted plans, it‚Äôs all about the caps.
---
I must admit, that is pretty impressive.
---
Excuse me but we were talking about within a nuke zone.  You aren't gonna be sneaking a lot in Scorched Earth, nor will you be doing a whole lot of trading.  Accuracy and Range in VATS can also be increased in PA with mods and the Stabilized perk, which cannot be used outside PA.  I explained above that I run an unyielding bloodied build, so I guess most people with a brain can infer that I appreciate its benefits.  My point was that PA isn't a taboo in Scorched Earth, you can do just fine with it.  I stand by that statement, in any god damned universe.
---
Thank you.
---
During the beta we took the red rocket and the first attack was 2 scorchbeasts. 
---
Our first encounter. Me and my pal were like level 23 or something and the other guy was like 5. We ran out of ammo and had to keep running out to repair the turrets. We ended up just giving up. 
---
Also! don't bother defending. Just let the enemy take it over and then capture it back. Quicker and easier.
---
Brad Mondo would be proud.
---
I drop them in my private world so no one can ever get them. But it‚Äôs purely symbolic - there are probably millions of them in circulation.
---
yeah mang: bludybowlingpin
---
There are ways, glitches and this man‚Äôs method of staying absolutely squeaky clean in a rad zone. I also didn‚Äôt read you correctly because it‚Äôs 0306... I should go to sleep. My apologies.
---
&gt;I saw an opossum! That‚Äôs no relevant, they‚Äôre just my favorite animal. 
---
Not relevant!? As if, opossums are one of the coolest animals and the ones in this game are even better. If I could tame one and have it in my camp I'd be thrilled.
---
Still got 3 hrs left of download so will be tomrow :)
---
His video on spawn rates and the recently looted items list was a total game changer.
---
According to your database, it is said that "Plan: Dense Trapper Armor Torso" can be obtained from vendor bots in the regions AshHeap, The Mire and Cranberry Bog with a 0.43% chance. That's right? This information refers to the Plan and not the mod, correct?
---
Fallout the movie.

whenever you get goin hit me up

When I was new to the game I loved getting new ones when people dropped them at the Fasnacht parade. I loath finding them inside of vendors, though...
---
LEEROY JANKINS!!!!!
---
I'm going to grind through the first hundred levels in like no time at all and then come on here and complain that there's nothing left to do.
---
Just doing their part.
---
I remember when I'd hear the whoosh of the wings and be like, "oh sh-" but now come at me scorchbeasts!
---
These storeis are the best in this sub! Keep The positivity up!!
---
Hey, ty for the reply. You're right l haven't crafted one yet, just bought the plan and mods. l'm currently running a sneaky vats Commando build. I've been wanting to try out the gauss shotty for a while but not too sure on how to create an effective shotty build.
---
And they didn‚Äôt attack me! I think they were glitched, but they just sat there while I cooked dinner ingame and then got dinner irl! It was lovely.
---
It seems that 'smarty' convinced him that it is easier to trade for what you want than to fight and risk your life. I just wonder why he has a pet brahmin.
---
Equip the butcher's bounty perk and go to a Scorched Earth queen event. Unless you need something specific that will give you more than 3.
---
Is is the veteran outfit or mountain scout outfit? English would assume the mountan scout outfit and balaclava make up the veteran outfit.. Where did the hat/balaclava come from and why is it still there? Don't you want to hold Bethesda accountable for all their faults and slimy business practices and get the hat or are you complacent in them not fixing their mistakes already? Can you not see the patterns here that Bethesda have created for us and themselves? Why do people still defend it?
---
You can usually find them as a drop on Scorchbeasts. I wouldn‚Äôt waste your time checking vendors because they usually spoil and people don‚Äôt sell them that often. There are spots on the map that look like circles with cracks in them; these are fissure sites where scorchbeasts will spawn.
---
Good luck.
---
Hard to sit in a dumpster for long when the things on fire.
---
The level 1 is a lot more explainable because you see players as level 1 until the server relays their actual level (this is most noticeable shortly after logging in atleast if you have high speed storage).
---
M72 or Bust!!!
---
It's not a glitch, just a nice part of the game. Level 1 wild life like possums, beavers, fox, squirrels, cats, dogs, etc will never be hostile towards you. You can't tame them like other creatures, but if you build your camp near where they spawn sometimes you can get lucky and adopt them that way.
---
The moment the Queen landed she was doomed - for Man has earned the right to hold this planet against all comers, by virtue of occasionally producing someone totally batshit insane.
---
and if you get my reference you win. :)
---
First, I‚Äôm really sorry that happened to you.  It‚Äôs not funny to destroy someone‚Äôs hard work.  With that said it sounds like you watched this shit go on for a minute.  Maybe I‚Äôm misinterpreting your words but either way in this game always be ready to dashboard.
---
Definitely not expecting it, just hopeful.
---
id love one, just not sure what we 76er's are calling our fashion side.  (fashionframe was the real endgame)
---
Once you use one you will see that concentrated fire and and covert op are not needed. And sneaking isn't needed either. This gun absolute OWNS!
---
Imo you don't need skeet shooter. With my gauss shotty I run refined receiver since it's damage is insane enough and that receiver boosts it's accuracy quite a bit. Just my two cents
---
:(
---
Just quit and spawn in a different server.
---
Even better, block the asshole first, then change servers.
---
You guys mind posting your builds for a look-see?

---
Gauss have an explosive element to them too. High int allows you to equip the needed gunsmith and science perks. 
---
20% of 10+ end is a lot better than 20% of 1 end. 
---
Most high level enemies are glowing, even if they don‚Äôt look it. If you find glowing meat on a body, more than likely it was glowing. 
---
 Adrenaline is an awesome perk. Max it. 
---
Just my thoughts.
---
And they make Awesome Opossum Bacon.  It's literally "Awesome" in addition to being bacon already.
---
Amazing, close to 2k hours and I never noticed that. Nice find.
---
Turn on pacifist mode or dont just sit there and watch somebody destroy your camp. Either option takes like 10 seconds.
---
I‚Äôve been in this sub for half an hour but I already love all of you.
---
Dah DUUUUUUUUUN **DUUUUUUUUUUUH**!!
---
Kinda hope not there should only be one laser musket
---
Yes, your budget size increases with level.
---
I thought this was a sly one Tamriel dig but reading down I see it‚Äôs actually real. Rip
---
They became legacy with wasetlanders
---
Was he wearing armor? If so, maybe we should get rid of that too! And he used ammo? Get rid of it!
---
Or maybe stop being a pleb and turn on pacifist mode..
---
Xbox here, we have to do enough damage as well.
---
Oh that sucks good luck though
---
The budget size increases with your level. You most likely weren‚Äôt playing long enough to get a large budget. You will absolutely run into the same problem again unless you play longer.
---
Thought it might be psycho... But I never saw it entirely.
---
Reminds me of my first hour playing roaming Appalachian bare naked with glasses and a party hat, wielding a machete eating raw meat like a maniac
---
Oh you're finally awake.
---
It‚Äôs not very accurate. The actual Bethesda studios doesn‚Äôt have computers. smh yuh should know better
---
definitely understand the anger of someone doing that, but thats like telling me to throw away 4 really good weapons so naahhh.
---
Untrue. It increases slightly with each level.

Bethesda won't even acknowledge the issue despite it affecting tons of people. The skin is still for sale even in its totally broken state.
---
Pardon my ignorance, but is what‚Äôs dropped to you based on how much damage you did?
---
Exactly
---
[removed]
---
I mean, that would make sense.  Cuz I've seen some damn big houses and shit that ppl have made that I couldnt come close to at my level
---
Well I‚Äôll keep you posted
---
If you are server hopping at all, make sure to check the couple of lootable 'Scorchbeast Nest' points in Watoga. Found a few there yesterday, along with other meat parts.
---
I always get excited when I see opossums because they mean bacon, and bacon is delicious.
---
Nope. Based on real life luck and nothing more.
---
Not likely, they haven't even acknowledged the problem, not even  listed on their support site
---
Same with green hood. Removes hair.
---
It only takes 5 minutes to start a new character and get them out of the vault. Could be worth it to have at least one.
---
Dont incentivize Bethesda. The endgame is already pretty much just collecting rare outfits... they might think that's all we want to do and add more instead of adding more bosses...
---
Love your name! Wish I had one about now, lol.
---
You could with that without sounding like a prick, I know you can, just give it a try ok! &lt;3
---
I posted mine.
---
Why? I don't owe you that.
---
Junkies, stalkers, instigating, and medics are all primary effects that have this damage ‚Äúglitch‚Äù
---
It takes less than a minute tbh.
---
Defend mount Blair has/had them, it's been a long time though (close to launch) so not sure if it still happens.
---
ty mate
---
It seemed like a fun post. I enjoyed reading. All the ‚Äúacktually‚Äù post im sure did ruin it. But I won‚Äôt read those.
---
Lmao!!!!
---
Did it copy/post correctly in my first comment?
---
Oh, what made you think that?
---
It applies to the public servers as well, but there is no way to know if an item is missing due to other players or if you have recently looted it.  I was farming Fiber Optics and Ultracite Ore and was wondering why my private server was already looted until further research.
---
You. I love you.
---
I think I logged just over 20 hours actively building and decorating
---
30th
---
thank you!
---
No!!!!!!!!!!! Opossums are babies!!!! They are just small babies!!!! 
---
Actually, bacon does sound great right now. Hm. Ideals or a nice snack....
---
&gt;So now that ya‚Äôll have thoroughly ruined the fun of my post, carry on.
---
No need. Our work here is done.
---
I just rolled a two shot 33 vats. I thought that was a monster. I kid you not I laughed out loud when I used that bloodied monstrosity in comparisonüòÇ
---
No, but if you don't hit the limit of what seems to be somewhere between 1k-2k you don't get any loot at all
---
That's determination!
---
Epic reward for the tens of people running a wood armor build and that one guy who doesn‚Äôt wear an outfit over them.
---
What were the other 2 things?
---
Absolutely! I only just noticed this recently, it was so disappointing!
---
We're mostly friendly. Beware the trap camp, the punji board clown (I refuse to conflate the 2), the workshop griefer and certain pvp exploits. 
---
Run on pacifists just to be careful.
---
I hath seen the power of darkness with mine own eyes, and I shall turn my face from temptation
---
Tuesday
---
If you can bring yourself to kill them. I'll just eat some canned dog food or use the cannibal perk to eat some ghouls so I can keep them around. Just wait until you see someone's camp with one of the light up Old Possum signs. I'm dying for that to be in the atom shop again. I need that so bad!
---
is that american time?
---
ok, thanks!
---
Im not 100% sure but i picked up the waffle/wabble? hair brush on one of my play throughs. Vase clean red and a clean coffee pot or something similar i think. I also recall seeing Rifle Gaming on youtube mention them in one of his videos if that helps.
---
I swear some of ya‚Äôll will take up arms against humor tooth and nailüòÇ
---
Sweet Atom, Yes!
---
The red glare would pretty damn fun as well
---
Hahaha got to give them credit.. ambitious SOB LOL
---
Love the big dick energy. Are you looking for a job.
---
It‚Äôs been patched, but not removed. So it‚Äôs legacy now. Would be nice though if they did allow Jetpacks on arms except you needed to craft it on both arms to work.
---
I did not, but decided to go with Raiders
---
yes, nice build! One question though, how do u avoid being swarmed by mobs in places like the burrows? I'm so used to sneaking around lol
---
Pretty sure it can be only be built at your own camp
---
what if its a mule ?
---
Hey, i don‚Äôt think the game lets anyone place the armco ammunition thingy on anyone else‚Äôs camp. I guess cuz its bought with gold bullion..
---
U sure ? I've had my friends build a ton of atomic shop stuff for me that I don't have
---
You had me at opossum, oh goodness. I was eyeing the mothman backpack but now....
---
I give them major credit. They didn't die once during the whole fight and I've died plenty of times level 100+. That person made my day lol.
---
That‚Äôs what the damage reduction perks are for. Fireproof will save you more than anything else. Also, bird bones and marsupial to jump out of the mob. 
---
Honestly though, all gauss are terrifying, a shot or two and it‚Äôs over.  
---
A good thing about this game is that, while not easy or cheap, you can respec you special to tweak your build. My advice is more of a guideline
---
There is no difference between level 50 and level 5000 besides time invested.
---
Armor bonuses don't help with stash space, and also don't help with PA/heavy weapon builds.
---
I like you're dramatic writing for this, made me smile but ye I agree that shit is bonkers haha
---
Just to be clear. You log back on to the same world?
---
Sir, I work for the Defense Intelligence Agency and we at the DIA have no sense of humor that we are aware of.
---
I‚Äôve only recently come back (about a month now)
---
And I‚Äôve had 0 people try and PVP me.
---
Do you mean when you‚Äôre taking a workshop and it starts PVP they destroy you?
---
Is it a neutral workshop or are you trying to steal theirs?
---
I would also suggest making sure you store you scrap as often as possible if you find this is a common occurrence.
---
I was very surprised as well, kinda used to people being dicks in these survival multiplayer games, but with FO76 I'm struggling with the amount of people have been trying to give me stuff. I feel bad because I tend to want to earn my stuff myself, so I just spam Love and No emotes. Sometimes I just take the stuff and dump them later :-(
---
Only once have I been attacked for no reason by this couple, who followed me when I fast travelled away and tried to provoke me. Ended up just changing world.
---
Do you mean 500 caps?
---
Yeah lol
---
Wrong sub mate
---
Fairly sure the ArmCo machine is a unique item that can only be built once at your own camp
---
Ok kewl. Sorry I‚Äôm on Xbox was just making sure. You might want to edit it because I though you we‚Äôre having a laugh.
---
Maybe you have bounties on yourself, or you were taking a workshop, players don‚Äôt usually kill without reason
---
Sorry, didn't see your message earlier.  We're down to 13 missing.  Healing Salve bog and mire, ultracite calibrated shocks and reactive plates, barbed walking cane, 3 pa paints from technical data, marine armor helmet, circus cage and croc backpack from treasure hunter event, lever gun scorched killer and nuka  cola dark from biv.
---
Awesome, ty for your input
---
I mean...ESO was never lacking for content, even at launch.  Certainly not to the extent of 76.
---
Thats why you keep the weapons in your personal stash.
---
PVP doesn't interest you yet you went to a PVP zone and then complain here when PVP surprisingly happened there...
---
Good idea too! I would love a pinned themed thread like that.
---
I just like looking at what cool outfit combinations people come up with ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you kill enemies with weapons that turn enemies to goo or ash and they eventually respawn, they can have no heads and be invincible.
---
No idea about the rest of the stuff though :)
---
Man literally just got yeeted
---
Anytime
---
Which, again, is completely useless for PA builds. Using armor with storage space bonuses also prevents you from using armor with bonuses that would actually help while playing the game, so sacrificing game play to fix a stash problem isn't an actual solution.
---
Yes please! I usually try to find higher level players on the map first then find their camps.
---
I understand your frustration and let me help you to the best of my abilities.
---
Pvp in workshops is always on, you might have pacifist on but they'll still kill you while you can't. For the guy just killing you, he wants your caps aka a griefer. Best way to avoid him is by server hopping since he'd spend caps on a workshop but not get anything out of it. So you just punished him.
---
The people you encounter in workshops are those that grind and buy legendary pieces which avoid damage from other players by 10% which makes your guns and my guns in fact, useless. Their build is usyually either a Legacy or Tesla cuz they can't shoot straight. And some perks to increase their health, while running a bloodied build. However, as 76 goes health and stat wise. Anyone past lvl 50, a lvl 600 for example is equal to a lvl 50. The only difference are your perk cards and how you designed your build. With the lvl 600 having 40 duplicates of a card while you have maybe 3, that's also why for a workshop it's best to do it in a group so you can actually grind resources without getting butchered. 
---
So, how do you avoid these people? Bethesda would tell you to not use workshops or use their Fallout 1st to grind on private worlds. Maybe if you have friends you can ask them if they have private worlds to grind there, if none of that is an option you could of course go for a plan of attack. Depending on your resources you could build your camp on a deposit so you use a extractor. You could also go for a workshop, build what you need. Leave everything unlocked and ignore it, if a griefer takes it from you. Simply sneak around so no one sees you and collect what's rightfully yours unless they destroyed it like some do. By leaving it unlocked it won't matter if they take it from you since you'll keep having access to it.
---
Exactly. I have a lvl9 mule @1600lbs n 4 vendors full of legendaries
---
90% of this game is hot garbage that barely functions. It is largely a failure but fuck if I don‚Äôt genuinely love it. I‚Äôve never seen a more broken pile of dogshit, I‚Äôm shocked that it was ever given a green light.
---
Word! Can‚Äôt believe I forgot it!
---
My bloodied one is actually a lot of fun. If the ammo wasn‚Äôt so heavy and the chance was lower of killing myself with it I‚Äôd probably main it a lot more. So I just pull it out when I get to 100 rounds, and have a blast with it. Can take out a lvl 50 scorch beast with it in like 5-7 shots. And doing The scorched horde at Line in the Sand event with it is super fun.
---
Even high lvl vendors have been crap lately. All bloodied weapons and ultracite armor plans.
---
I did this,  not quite that early,  but early enough to be useless. Wanted to see what the party was about when I saw all the players there on the map. I didn't do much, but I got quest credit and a drop from that.  Couldn't actually loot the queen herself.
---
Tried doing this with my friend and can confirm that you are not able to place it someone else's camp. Applies to the fert bombs maker as well.
---
This is another way to monetize a game without content. If somone finishes it in 24 hrs, it affects everyone, it tells bethsda it's ok to fuck the community. The next game they make is very dependent on this one,  this game is an experiment on how strong the consumer binds are.
---
The definition of a sandbox must have gotten mighty generous.  No impact on the world, no player-run factions or towns, no professions, no territory to control, no real economy to manage (no, trading legacy weapons back and forth is not an economy).  Players can't shape the world at all aside from decorating their house...and even that feature is lacking.  
---
No, RP is fine and dandy, but "allowing" the players to meander aimlessly is not what makes a sandbox.
---
It'll go the opposite. The free atoms I dare say will be on the decline with a view to drying up long term. This is why the atom store's stuck in a loop imo- the best shit will be released when the chunks of atoms only come from cash. It's a business move. Nothing's free.
---
You can build any gold purchased items outside your own camp.
---
Probably adrenal reaction, just take a rad x
---
https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/458657-fallout-76-camp-budget-problem
---
And even more places say it doesnt.  Bethesda's increased the budget with wastelanders, but it doesnt go up
---
Thanks I‚Äôve been trying to get it the last few months now it‚Äôs time to get it in 3 for 3
---
The fissure site above pumpkin house rapidly spawns.
---
Past Fallout games weren't trying to be a half-assed MMO, so that's not comparable.  76 sacrificed much to chase the looter-shooter trend so you can't be surprised when people start comparing it to other games of it's type and wondering why it comes up so short.
---
Do this! Seriously though if I see lots of weapons\armour at a camp in the forest I assume it's level &lt;50 selling non legos. I'm still gonna check but I'm not often wrong. Now if I see, on the map, that they're &lt;50 I'll probably forgo the trip. This is not to say I haven't scored some really good deals on plans\outfits on these trips but that's few and far between
---
they use 2010 android phones to code
---
Good for you. I don't see how this proposal hurts you; you're just one of the exceptions to the generally positive correlation, the existence of which I freely concede. 
---
Providing everyone with more information doesn't hurt anyone, though ‚Äî including you and your mule (or twinked alt, or whatever).
---
No u don't. That makes it worse as you'll burn double core and AP
---
This is at least the limit on Xbox.  I'm actually stuck with 49 because one of my slots is bugged and this crap ass challenge photo of a dead liberator keeps showing up during loads smfh.
---
I was saying when the camera first came out, why in the hell are they introducing more features when you're already extremely limited with storage.
---
level has nothing to do with it.. there are plenty of shit vendors at all levels...
---
12 mutations and not running class freak bloodied. A waste of 2 points. Running serendipity,starched,luck of the draw
---
Hahaha classic. Thanks
---
Impossible. The owner of the machine can only place it in his/her own camp. Even workshosp are off limits
---
You get it from doing the daily missions from Biv(South side of Morgantown-&gt;Big Al's tattoo parlor). Each day, you'll get either a "tipsy taste test" or "Wasted on \[...\] quest. You'll want to keep trying each day until you get "Wasted on \[Rad ant lager\]". Doing so will give you(automatically learn) the recipe and have you make one for Biv.
---
Shit I'd just give him my drop, he deserved it more than I did
---
I think that in general, level has something to do with it. 
---
You may disagree. Then you'd be free to ignore the level information, wouldn't you? 
---
Or would it somehow offend you to see it?
---
Theres a lot of events that people dont want to do unless they know theres a decent team of people contributing also. Events like riding shotgun/ encryptid/ scorched earth can be soloed by someone with a decent build but radiation rumble/ project paradise need more people to get the high tier rewards..
---
No love still for snipers?  How about a rifle?
---
Ah so that‚Äôs why toxic graft on monsters keep attacking my base
---
Following
---
I‚Äôm with you my friend.  A lot of passionate folks love to ruin the fun of posts.
---
I love your post
---
Nice try, Todd.  
---
I'm not letting you bad-touch (nerf) my "special place"
---
Have you tried asking it politely? /s
---
(Honest note: might be a bug, but try spamming the execute button, sometimes the server lags)
---
***ENCRYPTID
---
I haven't got one
---
Please i just want legendarys
---
How do you ensure that? People always talk about hopping worlds like they can pick and choose. I‚Äôve seen people say that they rejoin public worlds they were just on (without getting lucky). Ive also seen people say they can hop worlds without leaving their current world and going back to main menu. Am I just not reading right lol? I figured when you left your private world, it closes the world, and any time you go back to private it‚Äôs a new world. Idk I‚Äôm still new to game.
---
False.  I've solo run paradise 3 or 4 times with all 3 surviving.
---
Nah they met the butt of my shotgun, then the grill
---
Needs some A-1 doe
---
Killing things. And praying to rngesuse
---
How did you do the rounded porch?
---
WHERE
---
Don‚Äôt worry, those posts will be lost in the endless sea of ‚ÄúBethesda sucks because they can‚Äôt fix this/cancel your FO1st membership to get revenge posts.  I shall stay away from this subreddit for at least the first three weeks
---
That's exactly what adrenal reaction does. So my bet would be that.
---
Any where there are enemy's man. Its all rng
---
Lunch boxes definitely count as great. Get 3 friends together and you 4 have +100% EXP for an hour or whatever it was.
---
Not saying it isnt possible. But a lot of people seem to have trouble keeping 1 friendly alive... that's why I usually try to sneak off to a room where nobody else is üòÖ
---
I waited until level 306 to drop my first nuke lol. Don't worry about it
---
I had a unyielding +1perception/20% ammo weight on my thorn armor. I'm a high health vanguard 2handed melee. So I feel your pain.
---
You get a legendary combat armor piece for participating, but no other rewards and neither kill xp, nor event xp.
---
I had it a few days ago where a group of players would drop nukes one after the other, then let us shoot the queen a little bit before somehow one hitting her, sometimes even before she mutated. This happened 3 times in a row and I was in with my lvl 40 bloodied character with a double barrel shotgun. I did quite a lot of damage but never had enough time to deal the 1000 damage required to get the loot. I guess I was really close sometimes.
---
After 3 times I was sick of the session and wasting my ammunition for not getting any rewards and switched.
---
You clear silos ya? I‚Äôm new to clearing silos. My gf and I go together. We‚Äôve read you can drop more than one nuke from a single silo but we can never make it happen. So we fight over the nuke launch and it gets ugly. It‚Äôs tearing our family apart. Did they patch that feature? Should we just take turns? Or is there indeed a way to drop multiple nukes from same silo??
---
Yeah: don't use them, and try and get good on your own merit instead of relying on exploits like a *scrub!*
---
All day yesterday in multiple servers I saw level 4 to 9 at the Queen fights, lol. The died a lot, but damn it if they were not giving it a go!
---
Except for the queen. In order to get the event rewards and the loot you need to do at least 1000 damage, otherwise you only get a piece of combat armor for participating.
---
I hadn't thought of using the LFG page, thanks for that. I was fully expecting to wait till public teams were released, but perhaps I can get a quick jump in now
---
Anti Material Rifle?
---
Tattered field jacket is my favorite outfit tooooo
---
Look up a unique encounter map and follow that shit from the space station down to the bog. Like every random encounter.
---
Maybe it scales but I wouldn't think so as it's supposed to be for 50+ anyway. Were you in a team perhaps? AFAIK it counts for the whole team.
---
You can't pay your way through this until two weeks later. Plenty of players will reach level 100 legitimately in that window. 
---
There's no way to reach level 100 in 24 hours most likely unless you exploit your xp gains.
---
What's wrong with the posters?  They served their purpose for specific quests... Agree on the dumb personal terminal though
---
Splash damage is like, an exploding car next to you, or stuff like that. The only way people can grief now is exploding bait, but that's so rare I've never actually seen it happen.
---
Seriously though, again, you don't have to trust me. You can just try it. I've got 2300 hours in game, but nothing I say is going to change your mind one way or the other, clearly. Either do it, or don't. IDGAF.
---
As a left hander, the representation is a nice change of pace.
---
Yeah I have trouble with Abandoned Bog Town and 2 of the diseases. Can discover and contract the diseases multiple times on different toons but they never trigger the challenge üòÖ
---
A lot of threads suggest to submit tickets to Bethesda Help but these sort of problems should have been patched shortly after the challenge release.
---
Most of my toons are deep black, with black face paint and faces so scrunched that the eyes are completely hidden. I equip the Skull Mask from the Atom Shop and the Halloween costume skeleton outfit.
---
Spooky Scary
---
i take it if I plan on being in for a couple of hours. personally it's the only workshop I think is worth taking but I do it in my own session.
---
That's what my dad was saying but I still say there should be an option or something to flip it around
---
30/40 BOS combat armor is Sturdy, 35/45 is heavy
---
Because most of the time, the more difficult events are just not worth it. The rewards you get a mediocre and lackluster most of the time, which makes slogging your way through a tough event just simply not worth the hassle.
---
I've said it before, Bethesda needs to drastically improve the event rewards soon, otherwise a number of events are just gonna die altogether (if they haven't already).
---
What outfit is that?
---
This is why bethesda doesn't talk to us more
---
There's a Gauss minigun? I can't keep up
---
If you‚Äôre lucky you can find another player here on reddit that has an extra outfit for you to buy (might not be cheap since I think they are very rare) or you might be lucky and somebody will give it to you for free. 
---
Or you can just take the quest that has that 1% chance to reward it to you.
---
Oh I know, I was poking fun at the guy laughing at bloodied. I can tank a lot at 18% health, full health doesn‚Äôt do enough damage, ar least not for me. I like seeing 110s, not 24s ü§£
---
Players who, for whatever reason, don't wish to visit any CAMPs would not be affected by this proposal. 
---
Sightseers and shoppers might be helped by it. I would be.
---
Don't be scared! I was too until I posted a lfg and asked for help. The players on this game are so awesome you can practically bank on that if you ask for something small say...one bullet. Someone will respond with sure here's 1000 rounds and a legendary to go with it! We ran a solo in under 20 minutes and running silos are no big thing anymore. I'm on Xbox most days gt bumpynukkakilla be glad to run one with ya! Got a few friends that are always willing to run one too, safety in numbers lol
---
I actually just got myself one of those too. Did you use vats at all on the sbq? And what mods did you have on the gun?
---
Todd bless us, everyone.
---
I‚Äôm mad that the crossbow sights won‚Äôt stay on there I have to put glow sights on it every time I log in fix that before adding in new stuff is my opinion on this
---
No refunds , no returns , no replacements , no help , no hope , no shoes , no shirt ,no service .
---
If they did that for all weapons, then sure, otherwise, I'm fine with it as is.
---
The only way for you to obtain that item, is by buying the plan yourself with gold. Another player can‚Äôt build them for you. I can not build it on any of my friend‚Äôs camps. It‚Äôs not an option, it doesn‚Äôt even show up when you‚Äôre at another player‚Äôs camp. You have to buy the plan yourself.
---
With the wastelanders update. The plans are purchased from the raiders at max reputation with gold bullion
---
&gt;  faces so scrunched that the eyes are completely hidden
---
Looks like I have a new quest to complete lol
---
My gf randomly found your camp earlier. You have a spawn point at the middle of the cliffs to the left lol. She said maybe put a ledge with a door over there if you ever find it for the new players :p Pretty cool she said though!
---
When it tells me I can do the possum scouts missions (need 2 more badges to get the refrigerator mod, made mistake of getting high capacity first)  that is when I do my daily routine of possum missions, caps on 5 characters, scrips, raider/settler/davenport missions.  But I just got the game 3 months ago, so most people are done with this content I guess.
---
I‚Äôm a heavy PA build, vats is pointless and just burns AP and fusion cores. Penta barrel and prime capacitor to offset the ridiculous ammo cost
---
What platform?  PS4, xbone, pc?
---
Same here. I got a sentinel‚Äôs bolstering SS left arm.
---
I don't even bother with them anymore, outside of challenges. Don't remember the last time I actually went to pick a lock. I probably would do it more if I didn't have to spend 2 minutes changing perks back and fourth.
---
You're welcome, it's worked really well for me especially because Bethesda never responds to my tickets.
---
Ouch. Well holloween is not to far off. It was a decently common drop from the event last time around
---
Probably for the best. I‚Äôll go with this play style. Don‚Äôt remember the last time I got anything worth a lock pick anyway
---
I woulda gave you one, but I'm on xbox.. Hope you find one though!
---
OH. I just found out that my rep will suffer if I skip dialog lol so I have to start over
---
Woah thats some REAL nice move
---
Yeah some lvl 3 ones have a chance at a rare plan. But that's about it
---
Yea I‚Äôm in no rush...I still have not gone through the ash heap or toxic valley and have about 50 plus locations on the right side of the map to still discover.lol..I just really wanted to get them done because I find the freestates/enclave/brotherhood fascinating and cant wait till the update comes with them returning. If you have any fav locations for quests please feel free to let me know
---
Thats so nice of youüëèüëè
---
That take is wack. I would go with "There's not enough content in this game, I'm bored already!". But you do you.
---
Holy shit man thanks! Dmed u!
---
Man I don't even remember the quests lol. I'm 1k hours in now and kinda rushed threw them. I actually enjoy the grind lol. I know the mistress of mystery line is a fav of a lot of folk though
---
!
---
I was thinking a while back, as you do, that they should allow us to save 2 or 3 presents for perks so we can quickly switch card sets depending on what we need to do. Something like a set for combat/stealth, a set for picking/hacking/trading with vendors, and another set for crafting and building or something like that.
---
Even just 2presets would be helpful.
---
I remember back in 2018 that being a huge talking point in this sub. It would be so easy for Bethesda to implement, and they could even assign the hot keys (D pads) to specific presets. Sadly it feels like it‚Äôs not at the top of their list
---
Honestly I really loved that weapon, enjoyed the crank much more than holding down the button until you fire. Plus its better looking and half a silencer.
---
I will def take you up on that, I have fo1st so getting a team together could be cool. I know I have a nuck card already but that‚Äôs all I got lol...I haven‚Äôt even found any of the 3 silos yet so I should prob do that first bwhahahahahaha
---
SBQ event, guaranteed 3* + a chance of more showing. Uranium fever , good chance of at least one showing up. Same deal for radiation Rumble and riding shotgun events. Otherwise just farm areas like whitesprings, west Tek, Harper's ferry etc. Basically anywhere you will encounter hordes of enemies. And then yeh, hope the legends that do show up, are 3 *.
---
They never did, but to be fair people were always this toxic to begin with. A bit too late to toss around blame but I guess you are right
---
Yes I did that one and loved it...have all the weapons and mask in my display cases...very proud that I did that lol
---
Not if the poor SOB has the glitch.
---
I've been on more than 2 dozen SBQ kills,  gotten loot and event rewards each time and the game refuses to recognize the kill.
---
Thanks to everyone who commented! Miraculously, I found an awesome-enough player to give me one! Thanks for the help and good wishes. Never expected this type of help
---
Im a high-health Vanguard build, and also rolled a 2* BFFR Shotgun. I cleared my addictions/mutations and changed my armor back to Unyielding just to test it out haha
---
Bad news, they stated that the text stating that you could craft it was in error and mask was working as intended.
---
Not a problem. The keycards are cake to get (currently have at least 3) and I have all three locations discovered on my map and that's all you really need. Save some ammo and stims. You will however need to do the enclave quests which we can help you do too if you need.
---
It's on the roadmap but not slated until Winter. Really disappointed about that since it's been requested since day one. I wish they just made the lockpick/hacking/crafting ones into permanent passives. It wouldn't effect much except making everyone's lives easier.
---
If I hadn't recently gotten my full Vang SS armor set finished I would certainly be more tempted. Even at full health the damage is ludicrous
---
TO BE FAIIIIR
---
max Blocker is a must for any build..
---
ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game
---
Imagine one of them landing ing the killing MELEE blow on her. üòÜüòÆüò¨ü§ò
---
*sigh* guess i gotta keep rolling, i got my bloodied magic gaus shotty already, just need to finish my uny ss set
---
Honestly, I'm totally down for this.  You know what you are getting and arent left to hope like the rest of the game.
---
Serendipity, dodgy, blocker, i think there's another for high str that boosts dr.
---
With unyielding jacking up your stats you get big dr bonuses.
---
I love stealing nukes....but them I do help them launch the next
---
Exactly, it wouldn‚Äôt make anyone op or anything, it seems like a no brainer.
---
About the roadmap, is that an official roadmap by Bethesda? Could I find it on the subreddit?
---
STVI... Seal Team 6?
---
I don't even bother unless I'm in a team that's willing to do them. I try to run them by myself as best I can, but unless I see more than 1 person there, I don't bother. It usually ends in failure and a need to restock ammo and healing chems.   
---
I've sometimes gotten lucky and started the event and people show up, but it isn't often. Sometimes, I'll run through a good chunk of the event for people to fast travel in, camp in a safe spot, and reap the rewards for doing absolutely fuck-all.   
---
Oddly enough, I find that doing the shitty little events like Campfire Tales and the Giant Tea Pot end up with the most people coming in to actually help.
---
It‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre fighting scorched, not great against most other things
---
That would be sweet!  I would grind some bullion to roll some of those.
---
It's one hell of a grind; it can only drop from daily quests and events in the Mire, with a 0.02% chance, and that chance is also shared by the Leather Coat and Traveling Leather Coat so even if you magically get the 0.02% drop there's only a 1/3rd chance of getting the one you actually want. Granted, you could probably find someone interested in a 1:1 trade, but still. I try to complete at least one daily or event in the Mire every play session and so far, after hundreds of hours of playtime, I've still never gotten one.
---
Just listing the legendaries doesn't say much. Those effects on a Handmade Rifle would be far more useful than on a Broadsider.
---
Depending on the weapon it might be useful for hunting Scorched Beasts or for the SBQ if you do t have anything better, but really it depends on the weapon.
---
SBQ is not guaranteed to drop a 3*.
---
Feel free to add me on this old post. pkunachan.
---
You're looking at it wrong Bethesda doesn't want you to grind, they want you to spend money. They're basically saying " you can grind if you want" or "you can pay us $150 for a season. The battle pass is more or less focused towards the whales then it is the average player.
---
i just edited it
---
Yes for some reason consoles are limited to 50 images stored at a time as opposed to unlimited on PC
---
Watch Magic Weapons from Angry Turtle on YouTube
---
Will do once I move and get my system set up
---
scrip
---
Not sure if this will help but I managed to get the all diseases challenge by accident after thinking it was bugged. Listed sludge lung as unacquired when I had gotten it multiple times from wendigos and the ash heap. What triggered the challenge as complete was catching buzz brain which had been listed as already caught. So I think the issue is that the challenge is labelling certain diseases incorrectly. So there's probably two diseases you have not caught yet, but they are not the ones listed as unacquired.
---
Fortune favors the bold!

Sleep in a bed, talk to the mothman during the 'Path to Enlightenment' event, and eat cranberry cobbler/relish.

I'm still incredibly surprised they didn't do that

Tuesday the 30th, barring any issues.
---
That shit pisses me off so hard. I love to freeze the queen at SBQ fights. I have a Zealot's Cryolater and it freezes her and it's so fun to watch her in slow-mo... and everyone loves it when I do it. But I rarely get anything off her, I don't do enough damage. But I don't really care, it's not like I need anything lol
---
Riding shotgun is a pretty fun event. Guaranteed at least one legendary and it‚Äôs always been 3 stars. Sometimes there‚Äôs other legendaries too. Treasury notes as well.
---
YEah I mostly fight SBQ for the repair kits. LOVE those
---
They still got credit if they were near the quest when the Scorchbeast died. I‚Äôve fast traveled there right as it died before and got credit for completing the quest without landing a single hit (it died like 2 seconds after I spawned in there lol).
---
All the bonus perks are additive, based off of the base damage...so max riflemen cards on do 25 extra bonus each( 125 to 200) then sneak is double the 125 (200+250 = 450) and almost certain with head shot is double base not modified....
---
#RonBurgandy #FTW
---
I don't get it super frequently, but it has happened to me probably once every couple of weeks.  
---
I also have it where it just keeps spinning on the loading screen but doesn't actually load.
---
To be more accurate, the last one should be between update and game crash.
---
I'd give that weapon a C, C+ at best. Keep it if you want a fun toy or if that's the best you've got. Otherwise just take the 40 scrip for it.
---
I LOVE leaving fun stuff in the stash at the Overseer's camp. Or in a bag in front of the vault door. Especially golfing outfits with visors lol
---
One of the Gold Bullion items should be a Grahm Detector since it is so annoying finding that lovable Green Giant.
---
Not gonna advocate for this, or even say it works 100% of the time. But you can get the outfit, and use the scrap box for a month, or however long before the next billing cycle for free
---
Just request a refund via the Xbox subscription in settings or on the Microsoft site, via the bethnet F1st services, or the PS equivalent. Xbox seems pretty lax on getting a refund even multiple weeks in, from personal experience. I've heard the same from other systems
---
I'm not gonna say this is right, but you can subscribe, grab the stuff, make use of the scrap box for storage, and request a refund. Be cautious as this may not work, also I should be cautios as I have no idea what consequences there are on this sub for recommending something 'wrong'
---
I was just talking about the Junk Jet with my friend. I cant wait to snipe heads with Mr. Fuzzies
---
Im on ps4 and suffer no lag...üëÅüëÑüëÅ
---
 Consider me peanut butter and jealous. That‚Äôs a great find. More valuable then rare rare outfits probably
---
This game may be a dumpster fire BUT DAMN we sure were excited for it. I remember learning where there were static PA spawns before I ever even opened up the game. It sure was fun at first. I remember camping on the Whitespring lawn and going into the main building and picking up every ashtray and vase to sell lol. God, remember when the stash was 400 pounds and everyone was using the carryweight glitch? good times
---
I have done them, i have the quest for launching a nuke. I have at any given time 4000 50 cal and 3000 2mm ec along with 6000 fusion cells with my auto lazer rifle lol...and 300 stims I like to be prepared for anything
---
thats amazing ahaha
---
Just try building and storing a brahmin resource camp item. Every time the brahmin spawns you can milk it.
---
Ya I‚Äôm not sure what the cause was but this was the only game I‚Äôve ever had serious frame drops in
---
&gt; There is a strong positive correlation between a player's level, on the one hand, and the quality and variety of things he might have to sell in his vending machines, on the other hand. 
---
That's not been my experience at all. I've seen well stocked vendors with low level characters (even sub level 10 once) as well as high level vendors either selling mostly stuff most people don't want (clothing, low level gear for new players) or sell at such ridiculously high prices.
---
Level has little correlation to quality of content. Certainly not "strong positive correlation".
---
Eat Canned Meat Stew and use the Bobblehead: Leader if you can find it.
---
Ah, did you do that for the birth date of House? I can't believe he was born a couple of days ago lol. Your render is so GREAT, looks just like Mr. House! Very good. Would love to suddenly turn around at a vendor or something and see this guy , haha I'd be like 'what fallout game am I playing"
---
I prefer ffr
---
There seems to be a 5 to 10 minute timer for the private server to be completely shut down.  I had a problem with one of the events that turned off my graphics and restarting the game had the event still running.
---
Lol no kidding! Sweet next time I'm on hit me up we'll get you that achievement!
---
Default I think is 3000 but so many people do SBQ now the demand isn‚Äôt very high, I bought one the other day for me alt for 150caps.
---
It's amazing that you got downvoted for telling the truth. I've seen enough sub level 50 mules that have a ton of stuff they would never have gotten naturally.
---
You can open all the perk card packs you want and technically don‚Äôt have to put points toward anything I didn‚Äôt use most perk points till level 25 but was quite difficult to do the story that way since I knew what I wanted on my second character.
---
He is very thorough and has video proof to back it up. All we have here so far is personal anecdotes. You tell me which someone should believe at face value.
---
Hopefully, Bethesda implements an Account Bank and you can just transfer that weapon to a character with a low health build.
---
I‚Äôve seen it happen a few times in the last couple of months are PS4.
---
Same on xbox
---
I've always said, the community overall is the best part of the game.
---
No u right
---
I nuke winter spring on my private server, think I had 12-15 legos before the cloud was gone, plus all the rad mats I could want.
---
/shrugs right now Im trying to  build up my in use recipe and plan collection, Even then the only reason I would move my camp is if I need to have a spot for Resource machines. and a lack of being able to build interesting buildings currently.
---
Sure thing sound good thanx
---
And the only effective method in battling it is P2W.
---
Sounds like you're not a holla-back girl. Check wiki
---
I‚Äôll donate you an anti armor golf club I found if you are on PC lol
---
I haven‚Äôt heard about this. Can you give mea few details or point me to a link please?
---
The workshop that was where the Foundation is now also had SBs as a defend event. Back during BETA and early days if i saw them id just run. Never had a chance against 3 of them at level 25
---
It's not useless at all. It's more of an early game feature. I still use it occasionally to know when a few of the dailies have reset.
---
Having said that though, would be nice to have more functionality like you'd alluded to.
---
welcome!  
---
first of all, to me, this is a game about discovering. so, head where ever you want and discover the world. follow the quest to search the overseers holotapes and take a stop at the wayward. then south via flatwood and north to morgantown and its airport is a nice starting area, some enemies but nothing too fancy.   
---
  
---
in general, start thinking what kind of build you want. like melee or shotgun (STR perks are a good start here) or rifle/automatic weapons (PER). there are tons of builds, read a little bit but dont think too much, builds change during the play. [this is a great site](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to try the perks and see what is there to come. sadly, there are no passive skills. so we have to activate the picklock or hacking perkcards manually when we want to use it. dont have them always equipped, there are a lot of other things to use.   
---
and one last thing: in 76, bobbleheads and magazines give only temporary bonus! i knew them from fo4 and bought a lot of them at the first vendor i came across. i went broke for nothing, dont to that too ;)
---
If you have PS4, I can bring my Robert house Knockoff to your camp. XD
---
I think everyone is ignoring the fact that camp is friggn floating, WTF
---
I‚Äôve given up on radiation rumble as I know I‚Äôll fail it alone. Even with that one lvl 40 I know I‚Äôll fail
---
For fucks sake if it was in a bundle, which it most certainly would be, it'd cost the same as one months of 1st. 
---
Buy a month, get the outfit, the dance emotes and back more atoms than what paid. If you hate 1st so much then you can not use the scrap box and the tent.
---
They'd have to have a rhyming name but all I can come up with is Where the Fuck is Derp.
---
Now that's Free States material!
---
I‚Äôve had 5 or so people on encrypted that sat there shooting at the invincible and invisible imposter, or not even activating pylons to help distribute health.
---
Aw man . Sadly, I'm on PC. But thanks for the offer. When are we going to be able to play any game across all platforms ??? This is so frustrating
---
Grab everything in the vault before you leave. Ammo, health, and caps will be in short supply from the start. Use pipes, wrenches, boards to start off. Explore. Grab what drops from enemies, sell whatever you don't need. Cook your meat from animals, free food, and a source of extra caps when you have an excess.
---
Higher level players that beeline towards you usually aren't there to kill you, if they stop, and drop a paper bag, doctor's bag, a pile of bones, a meat pile, or a parachute bag, it's going to be stuff they're giving you. Aid, guns, armor, ammo.
---
CAMP plans that come from each faction (settlers or raiders) cannot be placed at other camps. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt place farmable tiles at my friend‚Äôs base.
---
The vendor sells all parts and mods for armor. The terminal in command center has the base PA plans for free.
---
The real pro move is to grind it all in 24 hours straight and then complain theres not enough content.
---
Yes.
---
My low level nearly naked mule with no defensive perks and 90% radiation damage is practically invulnerable and can survive level 62 charred ghouls no problem.
---
My main character with full SS gets 1-shot all the time by them from 20% health.
---
The game is just completely fucking busted.
---
Dicks
---
Not on the queen. I went through all of my ammo at level 50 and still couldn‚Äôt loot the bitch
---
Xbox here too, I‚Äôve been getting it ever so increasingly in the past week. I also get indefinite loading screens. Not only with fast travel though, entering buildings does it too. Its probably a 1/3 chance that when I enter the Pick my game crashes/needs te be force quit and restarted
---
Zoom in on your crossbow in photo mode . The sights are under the crossbow. I like my instigating crossbow but the sights bug is making it less fun.
---
I also did this! Stopped playing in January of last year and put nearly double the time into it over the last month and a half. At 400 hours I‚Äôm just barely starting to get bored of it.
---
One thing about the 10mm submachine gun is that it‚Äôs super satisfying and fun to use, another bonus is the cheap and easy to come by ammo.  Keep it for events like uranium fever where you don‚Äôt want to be one shot killing everything.  Would be a fun gun for the forest area as well.
---
Go to every event that's populated, try to shoot everything, don't even bother with stimpacs or armor, just die. You'll get xp for the event and every mob you shot.
---
Try re-logging if you haven‚Äôt already.
---
Meh.  Most people are busting out of quarantine and others had finished the new content.  They‚Äôll be back
---
Nah, you're paying for the new content everyone's getting
---
If you've played a lot of previous Bethesda games, you have to unlearn a lot of things those games taught and encouraged, like
---
* Being a jack of all trades is counter-productive. Pick 1-2 styles of weapons at most and stick with it.
---
* Only carry what you need in the moment and nothing further. Hoarding stuff for future levels or just in case usually just means wasted space and more time spent on inventory management. It's ok to hoard everything up to like level 5-10 since you have the space and need to build up scrap for crafting but after that, hoarding becomes a problem.
---
* Let go of the idea of being a collector. You don't have the space for it.
---
* Don't rush down the main quest path. You'll soon hit a level wall where everything is too high level for you to handle.
---
After that, just take the game slow and explore everything in each area as you go. There's a lot of stuff to discover, some events are triggered by entering a specific area or reading specific notes/terminals.
---
Lastly, conserve ammo for at least the first 20-30 levels. Even if you're going to be a gun build, carry around a melee weapon to kill of easy enemies and only use the ammo for tougher fights. After a while you'll get enough ammo and the means to find/create more that shortage of ammo won't be an issue anymore.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Kinda mean tbh.
---
Are you PC and did you lose a set of PA?
---
If so, I am happy to make you a new set of T-51b with mods for free.
---
How are public team's going to help this issue?
---
Usually takes me 20+ crafts to start looking like I might get a Bloodied shotgun.
---
See a lot of posts where people get it in the first couple and it's not the one they were after.
---
Are you kidding me they added something that is that broken come on now please tell me it‚Äôll be fixed in update 20. I love my instigating crossbow but those sights are just terrible on it I have to use vats or just hide until I get a good shot
---
For a game with such a bumpy launch it sure sucks you in doesn‚Äôt it? It used to be the only game I played in college. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, are there any places worth visiting again because they‚Äôve added content to them? I‚Äôm aware of settlements and whatnot, but I guess I‚Äôm referring to miscellaneous buildings and areas
---
He doesn't hate FO1st, they're not in a situation where they can afford it comfortably.
---
Meanwhile my bloodied gunslinger character has crafted like 20-30 pistols and haven't even gotten a 1* bloodied
---
I was a lvl 2 mule account and did the same thing with just my fists ü§£ astonishingly I never died
---
I did this at about level 12, except with a gold club. Insta died, then took max rads without any meds and was in a world of pain. I did not receive any loot.
---
You don‚Äôt need to be a dick about it. If you read the whole thing, you‚Äôd see they can‚Äôt pay for it.
---
You're very aggressive about this topic. Any level can have shitty items in their vendors, showing level or not won't change that. It will influence people to skip over low levels that might actually have good stuff despite their level (mules maybe?) 
---
It would be better to separate things like clothing from armor and non-legendary weapons from legendary so people can see if you have 90 bits of tattered dresses or actual legendary armor.
---
Yeah - I'd like to know also.
---
Arrrgh!!! As a PC player, I freakin' soo wish this was multi-platform. ;\_;
---
I'm tired of people that can't spell  ENCRYPTID correctly.
---
I need this information so I can stop nuking low level camps.
---
How is it that big of a deal? They're just plans. Buy or don't buy.
---
For me the real issue has nothing to do with that or too many of any other thing you might be sick of seeing. Bethesda needs to do basic updates to the inventory/trading UI.
---
Even the most basic shit like filters would go a long way to deal with issues like this. Like a filter to remove any plans you've learned from the list. Filter by specific things you do want to see like legendary items, weapon plans etc. Even a search function would help a lot. All basic shit to implement.
---
The Exorcist or Toy Story 3.
---
You can at least roll with 3 other people who know the job and will so it.
---
I dunno about that. I had a camp in the divide that was left completely alone for quite awhile. Then I built a generator and after that scorched and rad rats started showing up. No defenses, just a couple of large water purifiers and a vending machine.
---
I know it gets on your nerves but my phone autocorrects to words on the dictionary. I know it‚Äôs spelled with an ‚Äòi‚Äô because I see it all the time.
---
blame my phone not me im sorry :(((((
---
It's about the only thing in the game where your APM matters.
---
All good - most people just let the pun fly over their heads.
---
Legacies are great but not for close up encounters.
---
Happened to me to just kill another legendary or something it will fix itself I had to do 15 before it fixed itself.
---
not to mention i find people hiding during fasnacht spinning in circles
---
And they're gorram idiots if they stick by it.
---
Really good pun for a criptid creature and robots
---
Events are not mandatory..
---
Exactly, it could be a simple hand mirroring effect
---
I‚Äôm new also, but am on Xbox. Is there a way to search for and remain on a specific server?
---
Do you have the Hornwright senior executive ID? If not that's what you're missing, if so then it's a bug and I suggest server hopping/restarting the game to see if it fixes it, it often does with stuff like that

That said, what does happen to me in the silo is getting put outside the silo, above the ceiling... when I VATS a turret sometimes. I'll just be walking along above the silo
---
When I catch people hiding I wave at them. I don't know if they realize they have a big yellow arrow above them, snitching on their location
---
 have gotten 4. sold 2 in my vendor
---
what does that do for Rad Resistance?
---
Yeah my account has issues with Berkeley, Abandoned Bog town, and the Tree village and refuses to register any discovery of them.  I‚Äôm missing out on 120 atoms because BGS refuses to fix it but decides, ‚ÄúHey lets get rid of daily atoms.‚Äù
---
Ffr is more universally good, as some enemies especially scorch beasts are resistant to explosive. 
---
That said explosive is more total damage if you use demo expert perk vs enemies that are not resistant and thus more ammo efficient in those cases.
---
So the answer is, neither is better.  Ffr is better in some scenarios and explosive in others.
---
Isnt accerelate better for faster fire rate?
---
then then add a item in the atom shop that makes you not idle out in NW.and auto reconect so you can afk it lol
---
Can I ask a dumb question. What is the difference between an imposter and sasquatch?
---
  . psa :  Tadpole quest   "revive an ally"  you dont have to be in a team for that.  you just have to stem someone when there down. i got this one at sbq fight. and the " in water" one at encrypted. was never in a team.
---
Just be patient. Im sure now that they have the Bullion system in place they will add new items to be bought with Bullion in the future. I do agree Melee users got a wee bit shafted though.Who wants to use a Cattle Prod??
---
Dupers. I've found so many bags filled with hundreds of mounted heads. I use to take them and hand them out to new players, but now they refuse or ignore them because everyone is doing the same thing lol
---
I think it works like this - each 10% HP you missing gives your bloodied weapon 10% more damage.
---
Keep wandering the cavern with the radscorps.  Eventually she‚Äôll blow open another wall.
---
I'll try to make this as short as I can.  
---
My first char was during the Beta which was quite an amusing label in itself. This first char was SO jacked up it would take forever solo to fix. I don't play multiplayer games and 76 was an exception. I deleted that char since I tried getting help and no one offered help.  
---
I am an advocate for power-leveling b/c gamers like me don't have a ton of free time to play as often as others. That first char was a learning mistake.  
---
I have a Shotgun/Sniper and a Gunslinger both of which are pretty good for solo. In games, I do well in a distance/sniper/stealth role and 76 is no different.  
---
This char has a Ant-Armor Rifle that is level 15 and he/she is 33. The backup is a Combat Shotgun as of last night but isn't fully modded yet. I did manage to start the Enclave questline through sheer LUCK and lots of running.  
---
I have yet to meet a person or group that is willing to help in this. He/she does have a metal arm piece that makes you go invisible when you crouch and that is a REALLY good addition.  
---
I only play Fallout games on PC though. I would like any advice to help a mostly solo player and can submit a Nukes&amp;Dragons build if you want.
---
Ah my bad I‚Äôll go to marketplace
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
literally had my private server open for days at a time never noticed any of the things people are talking about in this thread.
---
Wish I could add the photos but I don‚Äôt know how to...I‚Äôm new to reddit.
---
can confirm, ps4 brand new 3 months, lagging as hell and fps drops, and other online games like rdr2 online don't lag at all
---
The correct response to "This grind sucks" isn't "Make this grind longer", it's "Throw this grind in the trash and just copy the grind from other games that actually have competent endgame systems designers".
---
To each of us falls a task, and all the Emperor requires of us Guardsmen is that we stand the line, and we die fighting. It is what we do best: We die standing.
---
Different weapons also work better with different ones. For example, a junkies explosive Gatling gun is great because it packs extra punch and is largely a single shot weapon, but a FFR 50cal is a beast.
---
No clue why some people are experiencing it and others aren‚Äôt. it‚Äôs a completely different experience on pc tho no FPS drops at all
---
Those people aren't selfish just because they only do the queen or encryptid. Radiation rumble sucks, and  with project paradise, it ends up failing because of the ridiculous amount of enemies that take out the creatures you're protecting so fast. Also, people can do whatever events they want or don't want to. If you're gonna call anyone selfish, do it to the level 20 and below people that show up to the queen fight, because they can't do anything to help. Not even crowd control. I personally don't find them selfish though because I don't mind helping people level, and that's a lot of exp for them.
---
Scrap your own gear for mods. As you play the game and decide what build you want to try and work towards, you will eventually obtain plans for weapons. Gather the materials for whatever weapon you want to use the most, craft a few and then scrap them. You can unlock mods for you weapons so you dont have to try and buy from vendors.
---
yeah I saw some YouTubers playing and is like so smooth that is 100% a better game
---
I honestly don‚Äôt want to replay the main campaign again, so not sure a new game plus would help me stay more engaged than I am. I think the best we can hope for is that the story DLCs come more frequently than once a year. A Fallout game needs quests. Events have their place, but that‚Äôs not why people love the Fallout universe.
---
Or when you actually DO pick a lock, and get 3 caps and a broken pro snap camera... Oh and maybe some pre war money. If it ain't a silo, I don't pick a single lock.
---
An awesome fellow vault dweller helped me out. Thank you
---
had the same thing, she just stood there and did nothing. i looked up a video of the cavern part and saw shes supposed to blow up a wall. after changing server, it worked fine.
---
I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the grind, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs terrible. 
---
It‚Äôs just relatively shallow in terms of content to grind for.
---
It‚Äôs inhabited by the Mole Miner faction...lol.
---
Situational and depends on weapons
---
You ain't wrong.
---
Thanks!
---
If you get a 2* Bloodied FFR Handmade or Fixer, you're set lol  3* is meant for god rolls and trading.
---
Maybe Secret Service armor is allowing more people to retire their regular legendary pieces.
---
If you do the ally missions and new main quest they all pretty much take you through all of the newly added content. Visit a railroad station and read the posters on the bulletin board to start the Wild Wastelander quests. Don‚Äôt bother with events until you finish the new main quest. It‚Äôs all good content and the map definitely feels more like fallout with random encounters and player vending moving people around.
---
That's a pretty specific but neat idea
---
I actually just did this mission today on Xbox, power cycling my Xbox fixed it.
---
No, I meant that Bethesda should make another jetpack mod for the arms. Like mini thrusters that does the same thing as the jetpack, but takes both arm to use.

Sorry most of these replies are unhelpful, idk why people bother to reply to posts just to be a dick.
---
Best way to farm 3 stars is by doing a few things.
---
1. Anytime the event Uranium fever pops up, do it. There are 3 guaranteed legendary spawns during the event, and a good chance for them to be 3 star. Another event you should do is One Violent Night, which not only spawns many ghouls (usually 1 to 2 of them spawn as a legendary), but the final boss is also a legendary. 
---
2. I would keep these events also in mind, as they have a chance of either spawning a 3 star boss, or spawn legendary enemies; Campfire Tales, Awol Armaments, SBQ, and the one event where you have to herd and protect the Brahmin. (Sorry, the name slipped my mind lol) As a rule, it's generally a good idea to try and do any public events as they pop up though, since they all give you treasury notes and they are good for XP.
---
3. Whitesprings Golf Course!!! This place is the best for farming XP just by farming all the ghouls, but I've had REALLY good luck getting legendaries from the ghouls, including 3 stars. Just kill them, server hop, rinse and repeat. I'd definitely do this every so often just for the XP alone.
---
4. Sadly, a lot of the 3 stars you're gonna find are just kind of out there in the world. There's a lot of luck involved, but if you're really starving for 3 stars, then your best bet is to just *do* as much stuff as possible. Complete quests, events, and go on killing sprees as legendaries can spawn literally anywhere in the world.
---
Best of luck!!!
---
Does walking around naked count as an 'outfit'?
---
... it depends.
---
yes to every single word.    
---
especially the bank system is a thing. id be alright with a transaction fee of 10% or what not if only the caps dont just disappear anymore.
---
Spoken from a true bloodied build
---
PC steam sadly but thanks anyway.
---
I just realized that they nerfed a lot of things so that they balance PvP but then they removed PvP from the game.
---
Flamethrower üî•
---
So they are a plan after all.
---
Also, my group failed because I‚Äôm ex enclave, I like to stand in game whilst just scrolling through reddit, continually make false promises, constantly ask for resources off people without giving anything in return, my second in command doesn‚Äôt care about the group and is not interested whatsoever and I destroyed my last group because I am no good at being a leader.
---
If you like ideas being ignored, having resources demanded from you and no prospect of being promoted, then please join.
---
I don't think public teams will actually make a difference. I think people will join the teams for the buff and then go off and do their own thing. They might not even participate in the events that you choose to do.
---
Ok thanks.
---
Sounds like there is a yau gaui near you
---
Damage done to the mobs counts towards the damage needed to loot the queen.
---
Yeah its part of the issue with using older engines and games not designed for multiplayer.
---
true, thats a possibility i havent thought of üòÅ
---
You don't get him alot when sever hoping you usually get him after the ghoul merchant has already passed through and is at the other end of the tunnel

Carry a flaming chainsaw, that gives off light.

Tried to cross the savidge divide without marsupial
---
At least if mod support got added we could have that text chat for all.
---
YES!!!!!!!  I take photos all the time.  I delete the bad ones, but there are so many good ones!  Well, at least to me.
---
That's the sound a mirelurk queen makes when it emerges from the water.
---
Give it a little time, they will.
---
We can kick people if they do that :) I wondered the same thing lol
---
"If you need to make a roster change, you also have the ability to kick or block any players from your team who don‚Äôt turn out to be very nice."
---
comparing a group of people trying their hardest to monkeys is kind of like kicking someone while they're down. It's been talked about to death but the developers are likely doing their best under some bad management. I get that it's meant to be funny, and it is kind of funny, but it's more sad than funny at least to me.
---
Ha, jokes on you. I keep all my good shite I wanna sell in my vendors on my level 20 dude who‚Äôs camp is set up at Whitesprings Station.
---
300HP damage to the SQB is the bare minimum for loot. About 1%.
---
I hope it come relevant with future content, but with the content we have, I don't see the point.
---
Instigating Bow. As a bow lover I almost squealed with joy.
---
I like this.
---
That makes sense. But will that be the norm? Or will the norm be - hey everyone, just join group for the buff and do your own thing? I have noticed that most people (me included) tend to fly solo. But it would be awesome to have these buffs while we fly solo.
---
Pathetic how one of you idiots is using an alt account. Use your real account, coward. The harassment you guys are doing is very old.
---
If what Bethesda has said is true, then "gaining xp" is going to directly affect your ability to progress through the season levels.  So, in theory, anything you do to gain an xp bonus will directly impact your ability to power through the season levels faster.  If that is true, then you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by NOT joining an xp bonus public team whenever possible.
---
Sooo...without really giving it much thought, I basically assumed that the PC version, as opposed to the XB1 version of the game was somehow allowing players to use/place more assets when buildingq in your c.a.m.p... However, when I posted that reply earlier I was at work finishing up my 15 min break and still operating In my retail autopilot mode...lol
---
Used to sell fast for 1000 but I can barely sell them for 500 these days
---
That‚Äôs not remotely the same. Fallout 76 gets most of its profit from the atomic shop. People rarely buy from the creation club on fallout 4. If they allowed modder son fallout 76 nobody would buy the shitty atomic shop items
---
Yeah I mean if that's what people want to do, it'll mostly be up to the team leader and hopefully it'll be common courtesy to let people know when they join :P
---
I know the feeling I play 99% solo I just get tired of no one going to stuff like radiation rumble and project paradise, so I think it would be nice to have a team that wanted to do that kind of stuff
---
Also happy cake day :P
---
That. There's a Queen in the water nearby. Have no idea why she emerges with that suffering moaning, but that's her.
---
Okay, thanks
---
Dude, they've always had a communication issue with bad publicity. Thats a pretty well known thing.
---
I enjoy this game, but when I saw a game play channel I like watching the other day trying it and them coming across glitches and bugs within the small snapshot... i can get why it annoys people and its going to be more of an issue as the game keeps pushing updates while having a game with bugs that have been around since day 1
---
I use the full set of unyielding, because I'm a stealth bloodied chicken. I can for the most part sneak through almost anywhere, without being invisible, and I have almost unlimited AP for escaping, superhuman strength when I run out of bullets (my guy has a base strength of 3 and a bloodied DCG and to quote Phil Swift, "That's a lot of damage"), and I can carry a lot of stuff. I still use the CSS for nuke zones. I'll load up on flux and GM, HM, and HRF, then waddle out of the irradiated area, put my UY stuff back on, and fast travel back to my camp.
---
coming from a level 15 (just got the game from steam summer sale) how did they survive??? i cant even last against a normal scorched beast
---
Nice! Reminds me of the time someone greifed a whole shop while its owner was away so i repaired everything he had and used a few crafting tables before mercilessly hunting down the griefer as he was about to launch a nuke
---
&gt;It will influence people to skip over low levels that might actually have good stuff despite their level (mules maybe?)
---
Not if those people believe, as you do, that a low-level player is nevertheless likely to have high-quality stuff for sale (or a particularly interesting CAMP). Such people will ignore the level information. 
---
People like me, and the other people who've up-voted the OP, believe we could improve our enjoyment of the game without affecting you. I'm amused that you think it's "aggressive" to point these things out.
---
&gt; It would be better to separate things like clothing from armor and non-legendary weapons from legendary so people can see if you have 90 bits of tattered dresses or actual legendary armor. 
---
More info would be useful, but would require a more substantial overhaul of the current interface; there are practical limits to how much detail you can convey via a mouse-over pop-up window. But the existing interface certainly has room to add the player's level next to his name, and that's a trivial bit of coding.
---
Alright I was thinkin of just saving the pieces to the fav wheel and switching at will
---
There‚Äôs only one thing pathetic and that‚Äôs the EC:BoS ü§£ü§£
---
Ahh okay. Where I was at, the water is shallow. I did look around but didn't see anything. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.
---
Thanks for the response guys.
---
Now i want to see adult diaper under armor.  üòÑ
---
bro u can solo nuke runs with ur lvl dont be afraid, nuke the shit out of everyone
---
It's a wonderful community, and it's awesome that you're part of it now.
---
If it was truly Bethesda Studios, no one would actually be at the computers trying to address the problems. They would instead be off planning ways to improve atom shop sales...
---
Uh huh. Which one you fools is using an alt account? Man up coward, use your real account already.
---
You can complain tho, we have every right to because they keep fucking up.
---
Having never played on the PTS, I'm not 100% clear on this, but what I've seen suggests that people will join groups for the purpose of doing events, or PVP'ing; things folks would like to do, but can never count on having enough people. Currently, if I launch Encryptid, I have no guarantee that anyone will show up; and those who do, will likely just be there to shoot robots. Having a public group, whose sole intent is to grind events, is much better than scouring LFG forums and/or joining a guild that may or may not require daily participation, etc.
---
Imposter is an assaultron masquerading as a Sheepsquatch.  Go to a train station and read the Sheepsquatch Ate My Brother poster to start that quest. A Sheepsquatch is like 25% each of sasquatch/sheep/porcupine/WWE Erick Rowan. Either will kick the snot out of ya at a low level.
---
If this is them trying their hardest, they need to fire everyone and get actual people who care and try, cause these current workers ain‚Äôt cutting it
---
Only applies to private.
---
Sometimes even the private ones will reset as soon as you log.
---
Complaining is annoying. You can be critical without complaining. Once you begin complaining nobody will want to listen to you just like this post. Instead make a well thought out argument that is convincing instead of comparing them to animals.
---
put 250 rounds from a 50 cal prime, and still not got loot.
---
You only need one month of FO1 to get outfit not the monthly, I washed some cars for the money for the $14.
---
Yeah, but that's 5 spots on your fav wheel, and then your guy is naked; unless you put your underarmor and outfit on there too, then it's 7. I keep it in my inventory, and yeah it's a bit inconvenient to go into my pip boy, but I've already got 4 spots for weapons and 2 for meds; there's not much room for anything else.
---
Sometimes mobs appear and fall dead immediately, that's another case of the undying, sometimes headless, enemies that were recently killed by someone else.
---
This bug was in the game for ages now. Never fixed.
---
I think you're missing the point. The team leaders are who you should blame. Someone who manages the developers and focuses their attention. In other words: management. The developers do not choose what they work on, they are given a direction to work. Hopefully it's bug fixes but bug fixes typically don't bring in new players with shiny new content.
---
If you are on PC I could give you the plan tomorrow.
---
Makes sense...was killing hordes with tesla
---
you know if you take a bit of time to find the person on the map it does show there lvl.
---
You're complaining right now. We have *been* making legitimate well thought out posts detailing our logical arguments, and they keep getting ignored by Bethesda and bombarded with blind fanboys who refuse to see anything wrong with the game.
---
Hmm, you really think I was one of the miss guided people who were unfortunate enough to join you??
---
I already know what you‚Äôre like from before.
---
You do realise the community knows what you‚Äôre like and you‚Äôre generally disliked?
---
Haha dev team bad gib upvotes pls
---
just stop nuking camps .
---
Are you even playing the game? There are thousands of amazing CAMPS on youtube.. it's not as hard as it looks!
---
I was only kidding all that time just to ruon someone's day, they'd have to really deserve it
---
Yes, but it's not "high powered". The tri barrel shoots slower, but has higher damage per bullet and that seems to be why it is named as such.
---
Fair enough, but then you're complaining about my complaining. At least we're having a conversation about this. I don't know where you have been that there are blind fan boys because this sub is anything but. Practically every day there is a post about the bugs. Furthermore you need to keep talking about those things in a productive manner until they become major talking points. If all you do is make 'bethesda bad' posts with nothing worth while then what at all is there to talk about?
---
Yeah that gives a legendary itself if the thing dies withing the time
---
It won't matter, if there's any form of xp system glassed cavern is going to get a beating
---
I still have yet to find melons, I only have corn and razor grain...
---
Who cares about whoever's complaining? Say whatever the hell you want! you must be sleeping under a rock if you don't think that there are Bethesda fanboys on the subreddit, there are tons if you look at the comments on posts that criticize Bethesda...
---
We have been talking about these in a productive manner, like I said, I just said no one listens and those that do are the fanboys who then say we're just "haters." And that's the thing, we aren't making posts every day that are just "Bethesda bad." Have you even heard any of our legitimate complaints or took the time to understand them?
---
I like making hardened pipe rifles and naming them "welcome to apallachia" for new players and giving them a few hundred .38 rounds for it
---
Ah ok, so they are in very low demand. That helps a lot, thanks
---
No need to be sorry for being French
---
Damn guess nobody really wants them anymire
---
Huh? You either buy it from Bethesda for atoms or buy it from Bethesda for atoms.  
---
All adding Creation Club access would do is widen the arrange of weapon skins/shiny camp items we can buy.  
---
You know Creation Club stuff is "paid for" right?
---
Hmm.. okay I‚Äôll try that. Thanks!
---
Ah, I‚Äôm on PS4 but i appreciate the offer
---
üëçüèª thanks!
---
 that's where it put me when I drank the Nuka shine the first time for the quest
---
What category do serums fall under in the camo view?
---
Agree with everything except the location, keep whitesprings as an npc trade area, it also gets nuked pretty frequently which could be annoying.  
---
There's a cool mostly abandoned town in The Mire that has huge potential for your idea, Mosstown!
---
you know you can just move them on pc.
---
I agree there are fan boys but there is an equal amount who create posts like these which are literally just 'bethesda bad'. Like I need a CAMP full of monkeys to understand there's some shit management going on, I mean really it's obvious. But at the same time these posts don't mean dick. Like I said before, it would get more attention if these posts were more productive. Instead of making it about monkeys make an embarrassing compilation of enemies healing themselves or comparing how shitty a laser weapon is to a combat rifle. I don't know what the take away from posts like these are other than continuing a hate circlejerk which any youtuber, review, or even browsing this sub would tell you.
---
I prefer using rifleman to maximize my damage per shot but it has the same gist to it
---
Nothing, it makes it so you can't die from radiation though.
---
Haha love it! :)
---
How so?
---
I plan on starting a public team up every time I join a server. Players can join in to game with me or just for the benefits while they do their own stuff, either way is fine with me. I feel players will at first be hesitant to join up, but once they see that they can still do their own thing or actually join the group, everyone will be teaming up. Unless they just want solo play.
---
You guys are getting this quest to start?  (Visualize a Kenny Rossmore GIF)
---
Dude melee got 2 weapons and you are complaining the rifle class got nothing, 0.
---
What they should do is keep it at 50, but let us chose which ones to display via an option in the main menu. On console it does keep all of your shots, but only displays there ones you don't delete from the gallery. Would be a nice QOL addition for sure.
---
It is just too difficult to get any kind of decent rewards soloing Radiation Rumble or Project Paradise.  Even a team of 2 can struggle.  The problem is that you have to finish with near perfect marks to get the best rewards.  People get used to ignoring events that they feel they have a good chance of failing or getting reduced rewards. So they don't join them.  Bethesda should have learned this from the abysmal failure of the Vault 94 raid.  People won't grind hard events if they rarely get anything special for the effort.  Not everyone is capable of soloing these successfully. Merely getting notes and a few useless non-legendaries plus a pile of junk is not sufficient incentive for the kind of effort these events require.  People will grind like hell for any reasonable chance at something NEW, which sadly hardly exists for most players that have played and progressed enough to breeze through events like Radiation Rumble and Project  Paradise.  So to sum it up, to save these events the difficulty needs to be scaled down to a point where they can be soloed successfully if a player is at least above average in skill, and the reward pool needs to include new things.  Dishing out power armor mods and mounted bloatflies just doesn't work any more.
---
You're very welcome! Are you on PS4, by chance? I'd love to come by and see your camp "in person" so to speak.
---
Vending works but chems and buffs other than rested ,well tuned, well fed, and well hydrated does not show up under effects anymore ?
---
Why would I want to be hip to hip with people? For them to run around the same area, one hitting everything? 
---
If I join the Event group or make one I will be doing events yes, but if I join the "build" team aka the general XP boost team, I will just do my only thing.
---
NO
---
Be serious here: How/why? Give a straight answer instead of being vague. Do tell how you know that for sure?
---
Because from my perspective everything is quiet, both in-game and through here.
---
Who cares if I'm ex-Enclave, so what. Only reason i was even part of an Enclave Discord group was because the original Brotherhood of Steel Discord groups weren't the right people to be around with. But that was during the months before Fallout 76 came out, so who cares.
---
That nonsense shouldn't be important at all. None of that is relevant.
---
What I'm getting at here: It's a video game, grow up and stop the harassment. If you won't then this'll be taken up with the actual Reddit moderators. Your choice.
---
Again, use your real account. Talk like a real man instead of hiding behind an alt account.
---
She was actually very accommodating and landed, allowing me to beat her in the head with my Sheepsquatch Club for long enough to kill her.
---
Player hub should be instanced for each faction and up the player count to NW levels. They've shown they can do it for NW, so they can easily do it for a zone specifically for players to interact.
---
I think it's the bonus hp it gives you, it just makes it so you can't die from the rads, you'll take a lot of rads but they won't kill you
---
You mentioned being on the slim. I own all 3 versions of PS4 and can confirm the slim version experiences the most issues of any version by far. Even my OG PS4 I've had since launch runs better than my girlfriend's slim. Pro with an SSD runs with very few issues and frame drops.
---
True. There should be a cutoff time for joining an event that is in progress, and a participation threshold that must be met for rewards.  A certain amount of damage, or collecting X amount of feed/ore, etc.
---
That.must have taken forever and well with the effort amazing building skill and decorative genious.
---
Hmmm, I was doing the same when it happened - killing many scorched with a Tesla rifle at Line in the sand (while doing the survival tent trick to spawn them all together in front of the Sonic Generator.
---
Maybe there's a pattern there.
---
‚ÄòTheir‚Äô camp. ‚ÄòTheir‚Äô level. There are plenty of women who play this game. I‚Äôm braced for accusations of over-sensitivity, blah blah, but it honestly grates one me. Not every player is a dude, ffs. Is that so hard to internalise?
---
 I routinely have my private servers up for 5 to 10 hours and have not experienced these issues
---
/u/Slosten hiya, can you add Green Hood to the list?  If they see this post, I want to make sure it's listed too.  Green Hood makes you bald.
---
This is not true for some perks such as Covert Operative, Adrenaline, Nerd Rage and several others.  Those are calculated after all other damage boosts are combined.  Pretty sure Mr. Sandman falls into this category too.
---
Oh, alright. Thanks for the scoop. I have little markers all over my map because I've spent most of my wasteland career farming, trading, and grinding for script and gold. I'll keep an eye out for that though.
---
I think I can relate. I hoarded  weapons and armor for months to test a new bloodied char.
---
Had no problem solo the game beside sbq, encrypted etc with my main but with the bloodied it felt like being a NBA pro playing against toddlers.
---
Strength and intelligence
---
You're new around here, aren't you?
---
Right? It makes me feel anxious, like a whispered conversation that comes to a *dead stop* when I enter the room, and everyone just stares.
---
Okay, I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs just showing the imgur logo (kinda annoying) but if you click on the link it‚Äôll show up.
---
It's not a feature. You can find npcs on rover banks just doing this animation, similar to finding them on the side of the road chopping a tree or kicking a car for scrap.
---
&gt;I saw an opossum! That‚Äôs no relevant, they‚Äôre just my favorite animal.
---
Lmaooo i just spilled my coffee
---
Welcome in Appalachia!
---
Ah yeah, completely forgot about that. But what‚Äôs odd is Bethesda made it seem like we‚Äôd be able to do it, just by the fact that the person shown is in a vault suit.
---
To be fair this particular npc is wearing what looks like a vault suit. But yes it‚Äôs only with npc.
---
So my level 12 character today did a few shots and I got the normal loot from the fight and everything
---
They would have to get rid of that nearby fissure site, since I get a scorchbeast attack every time I go there. 
---
But they could leave the exterior of whitesprings exactly how it is to continue the possibility of nukes, and just create a fast travel spot to an interior location in whitesprings. There is so much space in there not being utilized. I dont know if they had plans for it and scrapped it, but it's so big and the only useful space are the bot vendors in the basement.
---
Can't they just switch servers before the nuke falls though?
---
You have to do the initial quest first if you hadn't so here's a quick link:
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wasted\_on\_Nukashine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wasted_on_Nukashine)
---
Rename them
---
Yes. I can‚Äôt believe I forgot this feature thank you
---
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt provide new content‚Äú ? Thats what Wastelanders was.
---
Wich playstyle / weapon ?
---
Ok but... just... how
---
This has to be a trap camp
---
We could use Sutton since the Overseer lives there.
---
She said she wanted to rebuild it anyway and I can't think of a better "neutrality oriented" third party faction than a bunch of other Dwellers taking over and rebuilding the Overseer's hometown.
---
It even has the benefit of being located in the forest so that new players can quickly gain access to the hub and perhaps even get exposed to another major quest line that fills the gap between the Wayward's and the Vault 79 quest.
---
I guess i just like the idea of opening the map up a bit, whitesprings is already littered with camps and draws so much traffic as it is, an outdoor hub in The Mire offers a bit of diversity, plus the fissure site could proc an event 'defend mosstown' or something, even with no event the amount of people that would be at the hub would melt the scorchbeast instantly
---
Old joke, but still little funny.
---
Well, of course, but I was talking about specifics. Like which perk cards I should choose
---
So they would be at the computers trying to solve problems?
---
So many possibilities, just goes to show how under utilised the map is, which sucks because  it's probably one of the best i've seen
---
All 3 heavy gunner perks, power user, batteries included and bear arms. Are the main ones.
---
Level 335, and +100 to all above. Tried all of it and yes, all valid.
---
Thank you. I will use these definitely
---
The hero we need.
---
Miscellaneous
---
How great would it be to have Photo Opportunity/Vital Equipment/Retirement Plan/Importance of Communication be something you can launch through the terminal?  
---
It's not like I'm hurting for caps, but I hate the:
---
1. FT to the overseer 
---
2. Get into the instance to get the quest 
---
3. FT to Crater, get the photos 
---
4. FT to the quest area 
---
5. FT back to Crater to turn it in
---
6. FT to Foundation 
---
7. FT to finish Vital Equipment
---
8. FT back to Foundation to turn it in
---
9. FT back to overseer 
---
10. Get into the instance to lie to Davenport
---
11. FT to Foundation to turn in all my Treasury Notes.   
---
Save me a few steps, Bethesda.
---
I mean, most other headwear does. It wouldn't make it better, just put it on equal footing with other headwear. It should be fair for the people that like it, no?
---
Hello. My suggestion is to create a second character for a heavy build. I myself have two characters, one for rifles and bows, and the other for heavy weapons, shotguns and melee weapons. This allows me to have fun with all the weapons in the game.
---
If you happen to be on PC, I can mod your weapons/PA for you.
---
No. I run 4 accounts at a time and I've never gotten rep on my other 3 while turning in rep dailies with my active account.
---
You go get a tiny amount of exp and caps, though.
---
Yeah i am on Xbox
---
That only works only if you are 0 meters away from the queen the whole fight. I still don't think you will be able to pull the same damage off with builds other than bloodied. Look, I can tell you are trying to make up for some unconfirmed comments you made and calling me stupid or some shit for not noticing that's a god mode. What I'm saying is, that damage I've shown is totally achievable without these god mode or some limb damage glitches and it is achievable only with bloodied build and bloodied is op. Bring me a junkies build that does even close to that damage and then we can talk. Oh wait junkies is magic duh
---
Did you leave drop site v9 out of the nuke zone? Players won't show up if you centered the nuke on site prime
---
Randal and Mr. Inman are my two favorite nerds hands down!!
---
I wasn‚Äôt meaning you, someone asked why some camps are bigger so I just answered them. My bad
---
Ty
---
But sharing is caring ...and one thing I‚Äôve learned in the wasteland is caring will get you killed
---
I was about to say "Solo Encriptyd" then I clicked the link, I think you win.
---
10,000 something.  Yes.  10,000.
---
The first step to a successful BoS build would probably be to change your name to Chad
---
Secret service helmet has a built in flashlight. That's what I'm using.
---
Lol
---
No worries mate. You have to embark on the Enclave quest line, and at some point you will be able to buy them from MODUS for an obscene amount of caps (+/- 22000).
---
I'm on PS4 and I'll give you one for free (same name)
---
I saw a 4600 recently
---
Nuka girl outfit while at it, bugged body texture since launch. Watermill too. I don't know why it has to take months for tiny issues like this.
---
I remember when it came out a lot of people were speculating this could be a new thing to do and a lot of people were excited for it, hopefully they‚Äôll add something like this because it‚Äôd be a cool way to find scrap/etc
---
I have done everything except a nuke run.   The whole deciphering the nuke code puts me off. 
---
I saw someone saying I could buy them in the enclave bunker, wasn't sure if I could trust it.
---
Very effective exp Exploit I yes.
---
Or he played for 277 days Straight of nonstop grinding if he leveled up 1 time every 40 minutes.
---
If you don‚Äôt run unyielding you minus well go full health junkies
---
First Possibly legitimate level
---
Try milking at the wayward and west bend tunnel east, should put enough heifers there to overcome the glitch. I had problem with the quest too, seems like it was the amount of brahmin, instead of the amount of milk collected.
---
Happened to me twice in the last week when traveling to SBQ event. I wasn't very happy about it, since after closing the game and starting it again, it didn't put me on the same server... üòë
---
It is the only way to get them - buy from the bunker. Please stop wasting your time trying to get them as a drop bro, I believe this possibility was patched out.
---
oh, thats great, thank you very much! also, finally something to spend my bullions as i use the CSA and dont need the other plans. will definitly check it.
---
Yeah, moss town would definitely work. Main reason I'm hesitant on that is because the mire is always visually bugged for me so I hate going there. God Ray's are all messed up. Hell, they could utilize the palace of the winding path. Only thing going on there is that meditation event that no one does, though itd be too close to the crater, and I'd rather have a more centralized location. But honestly, as long as they implement it I dont care where it is.

Most people do not want to spend time managing their vendor inventory to this level. It‚Äôs not exactly a fast and efficient process. And really, how someone manages their caps and inventory is up to them. If they want to simply log off when at max caps, why should they change what they do just for you? If anything is true of fo76, it‚Äôs that ppl should play however they want.
---
I feel like most accuracy problems in this game are related to server lag.   Outside of human error of course.
---
This reminds me of one time I destroyed a workshop that was repaired shortly after it was previously destroyed and then finished launching a nuke after a guy was hunted down while trying to run the silo
---
They're worthless. I have a "free stuff" table at my camp and I leave any jetpack plan (and other things) for anyone to pick up if they happen to visit.
---
wasn't my detention. I was there to take out some squatters when I saw her. spent about an hour there and she still remains in the area
---
Thank you.   My main character is my first character.   I built it horrible because i didn't know what I'm doing.  
---
I started a second character after wastelanders, can't even get a starched gene card yet, and I already found a marsupial and speed freak serum that I can't use for 500 each.  
---
Just holding them for now since my second character will inevitably have a better build anyway. 
---
My main toon can't do anything right.
---
Heres the thing  that'll do massive damage if you use VATS. The 50% limb damages bugged and does huge damage. Try it out.
---
Because the handmade explosion does 20% of base damage. The laser explosion does 100% base damage.
---
Legacy on an explosive energy weapon has a double meaning: the effect doesn't drop anymore but also the effect works like in the beginning (explosive was doing +100% damage before they changed it).
---
40 scrip
---
Holy shit is that the math on that one? Haha. Unjustifiable. I wonder if they have every perk in the game unlocked too.
---
Also, I‚Äôve heard from multiple reliable sources, you like to undermine your command staff and try to promote yes men above them.
---
All good, hang in there and know that in making mistakes we learn a lot - even if it is the hard way!
---
I did the math for every perk i think it‚Äôs around 450.
---
you are so uneducated about this game its painful
---
Commenting because I want to know too
---
Go big or go home
---
I wish I learned it in fallout before I learned it in real life.   
---
But as a noob, I have also started playing FO4 and can see why so many people like this game.   
---
Why can't Bethesda release a fallout that you can play either single player or multiplayer?   
---
Why can't the FO4 single player version work at the same time as online multiplayer?  
---
Seems like an obvious way for Bethesda to bring the old and new fallout community back into the next fallout game.
---
Soon as someone lets me know I shall let you know friend.
---
lmao thats about a 1 in 8993784309284 odds
---
congratulations OP, you have won fallout 76, todd will hand you the keys. its yours now.
---
Thanks
---
Meanwhile me in my enclave power armor is taking potshots from a hundred yards away with a rifle.
---
For a few months after the game came out When you over repaired your weapon to 200% you got a pretty noticeable damage buff and bonus DR/ER for over repaired armor and power armor. It made rippers and chainsaws really fun to use and actually usable but they removed it stating it was a "bug"
---
Good questions, wish I knew the answers!

---
Nothing on off map expeditions. Just "expeditions". Probably the fault of my wishful thinking ;)
---
It's from the "Raider Waster Bundle".
---
The Raider Waster Bundle includes:
---
Raider Waster Player Icon ‚Äì Bonus item exclusive to the Raider Waster Bundle
---
Raider Waster Power Armor Paint
---
Raider Waster Outfit
---
Raider Waster .50 Cal Skin
---
Raider Waster Tire Backpack
---
Raider Waster Pip-Boy Paint
---
Raider Waster Flags
---
Raider Salute Emote
---
Same. I have a Two Shot 33% VATs RW Auto grenade launcher. It rules. I‚Äôm always looking for 40mm grenades.
---
One violet night and Horde event (don't kill the boss) on a private server. Those two have guaranteed many high level legendaries (horde event only with certain enemies and only in certain locations, otherwise it's a, waste of time except the 3* boss). 
---
Uranium fever (easy 3 legendaries for scrip). Guided meditation has often a legendary or two (but the bonus after completing it breaks fast travel very often so I don't join it). Riding shotgun has a guaranteed 3*. Then there's SBQ and Encryptid. And when SBQ is done, check the pink forest next to it every 20 minutes or so to see if a Wendigo colossus spawns. 
---
Pure scrip - just do the dailies. Easy 50+ extra scrip every day. 
---
Running around the map between fissure sites - each has a good chance to spawn a legendary scorchbeast.
---
Man I‚Äôve been inspired to make a new toon named Chadzilla who specifically goes around the wasteland saving damsels in distress who‚Äôs players are doods
---
It's a great companion to CSA, since the light doesn't break stealth.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the Pip-boy get in the way if the character was to hold it the other way?
---
I bought the Waster bundle but not the Scabber one and the emote showed up for me afterwards, despite not being mentioned at all in the bundle. I'm not sure if they added it accidentally or just forgot to include it in the description, but it's the Waster bundle.
---
Yeah idk why it gets so much shade. I wreck everything with an AA gauss rifle. It‚Äôs my bread and butter.
---
Thank you
---
For every 5% health you lose you gain 5% damage
---
Ah see that‚Äôs the same thing the player I asked about it said, except when I look at the pack in game rather than an emote it says player icon, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not sure.
---
I sell them for 1 cap each
---
Well if you're going to be using a Galing Laser while using Power Armor: I suggest you Prime it/make Ultracite Fusion Cores (It won't use up regular Fusion Cores - Power Armor)
---
As for perks? How i personally would go for [At the top of my head]: 
---
Strength: Heavy Gunner (All 3 perks of it, if possible) - Bear Arms (Unless you come across a decent 90% Reduced Weight legendary variant) - Pain Train (Quite a few Power Armor/Heavy 'Perk Cards' under the Strength tree) Total Strength in all?: 8/10?
---
Endurance: Ironclad (Useful! Uh if you aren't spending 24/7 in your Power Armor of course) - Rad-Resistant - Good Doggy (All the Canned Dog Food plus all the benefits!) [Definitely a lot of Endurance 'Perk Cards' that could be useful for your build]
---
Intelligence: Batteries Included - Power User (Very useful!) (A lot, can't remember all of them sadly...)
---
The possibilities for a good 'Brotherhood Elder' build are endless. Just depends on how you actually want to do it. Not everyone has the same build after all.
---
Uninstall both the game and Bethesda. then reinstall.
---
Interesting... this tells me exactly what I want to know. Danke sch√∂n.
---
Now I gotta make a decision on if I really wanna spend 1260 of my 2530 atoms for an emote or not... Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time I‚Äôve done that, did that for the Free States Salute. But Daily and Weekly atoms are getting taken away on the 30th so I‚Äôve really gotta budget and weigh my options...
---
I've seen lots of people in the thousands lately. The god mode bug and experience buffs have made it pretty ridiculous.
---
I've had it happen several times. It seems to be uncommon but you should still be able to hit "i" to open your inventory.
---
No probs. Their atomic shop description can be misleading at times.
---
If the next fallout game had a single player version and a multiplayer version, I would probably play them both.   As, I think, most of us would.   And they could still have nuclear winter too. 
---
They could still champion single player games while also staying up with the multiplayer culture.
---
I name all mine scrip weapons "0"
---
Keep in mind there is a name limit, for some stupid reason
---
One can only hope!
---
Or, you could announce yourself and say your interested in a bunch of their stuff and ask if they‚Äôd have an issue spending 5k at their vendors.
---
On the other hand if you as a vendor set high prices, you should retain a buffer - probably twice the most expensive item in your vendor.
---
It's the: Free States Revolutionary Outfit.
---
Was in the Atom Shop (Again) a month ago i believe?
---
Huh that‚Äôs weird you‚Äôd think a newer version of the console would run better. Are their hardware differences between the slim and the og ps4 that may have caused this
---
JE Handmade. As I don‚Äôt run a junkies build it‚Äôs just sitting in my stash.
---
We both know they moved to multiplayer because you can't sell meaningless skins unless you are a multiplayer game.  
---
They would generate more interest I think if they lured the old fashioned single player fans back into it.  
---
After the best the game, they wouldn't be able to resist trying the online version.  
---
It would basically be the same game, same missions, but the online version would be harder.  
---
I wish I could play a FO4 version of 76.
---
Me: back around lvl 90 completely paranoid of other players being on the losing end of griefing a couple of times and not even knowing about pacifist most until I was in my 30s so I was fighting a lot I NEVER grouped or had voice chat on ...
---
During the fasnaucht(sorry spelling) parade I turned my mic on to listen to people I spoke once during a nuked parade...anyways I am hanging out at my camp between events and a lone salesman shows up...
---
Instead of dropping servers I greeted him and he proceeded to use his silver tongue (was impressive) and he gave me 100 presents (lol I had no idea wth they were)....he went on to explain to me the underbelly of fo76 and what that entails and how to perform a number of glitches in game my mind was blown and I‚Äôve never talked to anyone or hung out with anyone since it remains the most interesting drop of dopamine and enlightenment in game for me to this day
---
It's better than buying half a game at full price
---
Fashion76?
---
Yes you can
---
My bad followed the wrong line haha bloodied surprisingly very effective
---
Protect the brahmin is "Riding Shotgun" event at "Big bend Tunnel East", which is just west of Watoga. speak to Vinny to start the event. 
---
If he says not yet then just server hop and try again. I usually get quite a few legendaries spawn here. 
---
When you finish the event then server hop again and try and start a new one.
---
Easiest way to level up fast would be to be sure to sleep every few in game hours for a 5% boost and if you can do the event path to enlightenment thats another 5 and do the event feed the people to get some canned meat stew which can give you another 5 and then you can just do the main story and you will be going crazy with level ups. I would love to help but I play on Xbox since I can‚Äôt find a computer cheap enough that will run the games I want. I normally drop legendaries, aid items, and anything I can to help people starting over because I know the trouble.
---
Enclave bunker for 16.5k
---
I'd love to see them convert into something useful at least.
---
Also what's the cap for the Gold Bullion?
---
Oof!   I'm still working on gold buillion. Thanks.
---
Are we talking physical loot on the queen or quest reward from defeating the queen?
---
5000
---
It's a vault dweller, not an NPC. 
---
Either they really couldn't bother to make the distinction between the two while filming the trailer, or its' a cut feature.
---
Weapon degradation was in fallout 3. 4 felt kind of cheap without it. 
---
This way is much better than having to find the same gun and combine 2 into 1.
---
Nah, that's a stupid idea. What people are selling rarely has anything to do with their level.
---
How is this not a rick roll
---
Back when I was around level 250 I was wandering around looking for something to do, so I decided to check the Golf Club for legendaries.
---
Upon my arrival I noticed instead of ghouls there is level 42 liberators instead. I was immediately ready to leave thinking they weren‚Äôt gonna offer anything till I heard shooting inside. I sneak in just to see a low level player inside huddled in the corner of the kitchen trying to fend off this army of robots. (You might be thinking they‚Äôre just liberators, the giant rats of the game. Can‚Äôt be too bad right? These little buggers are wicked at higher levels though, and there was a lot of them.)
---
So in a spur of the moment I chuck a grenade into the room and charge into the crowd of liberators with my Two Shot LMG. (Note I‚Äôm a sneak rifle build but I stood up to get their attention away from the low level with the loudest gun I had.)
---
It turned into what looked like a scene from John Wick 3, me and this low level player were back to back fighting these liberators. It was awesome. As we start to clear out this place we headed downstairs I got jumped by three of them at once and got downed. 
---
My first though was ‚ÄúAh Christ I messed up... now this little low level is going to loot my junk after I die. I should have kept moving and not stopped here.‚Äù
---
Next thing I know this low level charges through the crowd of liberators and revives me, only to be immediately killed my them. I stood up and opened fire on the liberators killing the rest of them. I stopped to save this player‚Äôs life and they ended up saving mine at the cost of their own. 
---
I guarded their junk till they got back and was able to pick it up, then I dropped them some stims and radaway, plus the black cowboy hat I was wearing... which they immediately put on and gave a heart emote. 
---
Now that little low level will continue to play the game till they‚Äôre in the hundreds of levels, go on to help people themselves... Maybe they‚Äôll remember the man in the black trench coat and cowboy hat with an eyepatch who helped them that one day whenever they look at their hat.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn
---
Ps4 its 1000
---
I feel like they've nerfed that the most amount of legendaries I get there is 2, including the captain. 
---
This is coming from me who grinds the event for XP, imo it's quickest to get started and reliably starts as well.
---
Yea there's a few headwear items that do this think the green hood is the same. If I could have one small changed I'd add tinted visors to the flight helmets. They just look dumb with clear ones to me
---
üíú üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Stabilized is another "must have" with a PA heavy weapons build
---
I made a post about the Prototype Gauss Rifle and another user suggested it could be a plan bought from the Secret Service.  I think it‚Äôs a great idea and definitely a good investment.
---
I know you are protected from PvP before level 5, but I thought I saw someone mention in a Reddit post that your character cannot die before level 5.  Is that true?  If so, it would explain how they survived the SBQ fight.
---
I wonder how many levels he made with that event completed ü§î
---
How? Rust does this exact thing and implements it very well.
---
Maybe a kind of vendor with a transmitter in CAMP where we could place say like 3 items and have them appear in some kind of network.
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons)
---
no, we don't.
---
Also if we are going by the fact that bloatflies/crickets/bloodbug are plentiful,  the radtoad should not be in the game. Either way i just thought spiders would be a cool enemy with tons of ways they could be implemented.
---
if its maxed out you'll get someone pretty low with 1 hit, but with how long the reload is they'll heal before you get another 1 off.
---
that's either lag or he already took half the health bar before he started recording
---
You will need the current meta in armor and a tesla from eBay, nothing else will do apparently.
---
Hahaha, I thought I was the only one losing my shit over that stupid line. It is simply maddening for some inexplicable reason.
---
Like maybe 2 or 3 sec
---
It's not my responsibility to make sure that whoever I'm buying from has the space to fit the caps they're selling the items for, it's entirely their responsibility.
---
I got this ridiculous Gatling Gun 3 star for the random 3 star weapon at that miner's place. I wish you could at least choose which weapon class you want.
---
This is getting boring now
---
There are 'companies' with accounts run 24/7 by different players farming to sell items on eBay or other outlets.
---
Normal players have lives outside of games.
---
Like I mentioned, it's not a particularly high level of inventory management, it essentially amounts to picking a value that you don't take your caps past and listing items in your vendors up to that set value. (I set a buffer of around 5k-15k caps) That's very easy for even a novice player to do.  
---
And the reason why it's a dick move to log off while someone is at your vendors (As I already mentioned) is because it's your responsibility to either manage your inventory like a responsible human being or take your vendors offline. If someone wasted your time and money advertising something to you, and then disappeared before you could buy that item, would you blame yourself for wanting to have the item, and say that they're in the right? No, that's idiotic.
---
Ok
---
Why you saying that? You couldn't tell godmode from bloodied to begin with
---
i'll do what i want. :))
---
I‚Äôm level 15 and I fight storm queen with my pipe revolver :)
---
I always make sure to wear 2x pieces of fall damage armor for those 'high level' vendors so when they leave the server I don't fall to my death, although I never carry valuables in my pockets when on a shopping spree.
---
I often find if I hang about a bit in the area the player's camp will pop back again, maybe they go do some shopping/cap syncing to make some room for more sales.
---
I think the whole Teams story is about Bethesda's effort to compensate the lack of content in this game. They think killing sprees in Teams will be enough interesting to keep you playing. Like "Oh, look, we killed this big bad mutant together, jeez this game rulez!" And that's it.
---
Bethesda underestimates average player intelligence and want to make big money with small effort. 
---
More people will play this game only if Bethesda puts more content in it.
---
Sounds as though Bethesda didn‚Äôt have the capability to create and sustain a good online game, but chose to do it anyway... And we‚Äôre back to what we‚Äôve heard a thousand times - Bethesda lied to its customers, and charged us full price for a half finished game
---
If this is pc and the username is similar to this then its me and  my attempt at a mule haha, need to get to level 25 for the excavator so got in on it haha, Didn't get anything from the fight though but some nice people chucked me a load of 1 star legendaries though haha....... I hope this wasn't me and its just the new done thing upon leaving the vault.
---
Iron ore. No wait that‚Äôs actually valuable even though I‚Äôm still occasionally picking up mounted heads Just because I don‚Äôt have one
---
Why do you insult gorillas comparing them with Bethesda's programming?
---
Don't listen to anyone else but me, it was Godd Howard I swear.
---
Eyebots?
---
Nah you do get a drop, you just gotta try really hard to keep getting hits on the queen and ignoring the adds as much as possible. Me and my friend did it at like level 10 once
---
You should be aware that "virtue signaling" is not a phrase used outside of immature social media circles. It quickly outs you as a young, impressionable pouser with little experience of the real world and undermines any credibility to whatever message you may have had.
---
Hahahah I‚Äôve been there üòÇüòÇ
---
Dear Sir, I endorse your words! If only Bethesda cares...
---
was is a blonde woman with glasses, party hat and a massive nose?........bit like sarah jessica parker actually haha.
---
Same I‚Äôve been saying that‚Äôs since day one like if you want a rifle or heavy instead of it saying ranged weapon I think it should be short range and long range to help even out the pool a little cause right now it is just ridiculous I get anywhere from a 44 to a harpoon gun but most of the time I get Gatling guns I will never use because I am a bow/pistol build
---
Personally, I would have a Ballistic Heavy as back up. Uses the same Perk points in Strength (I'm assuming you have STR maxed as a Melee build) so the cards can be easily swapped out.
---
might as well go\* üëç
---
The marine head covering that is skin tight and looks kinda like a gimp hood that goes with the wetsuit does prevent it. The helmet that goes with the marine armor does not.
---
Likely a mule character. Someone has simply offloaded thier cap balance onto a mule who has bought your entire stock for whatever reason.
---
Yep heavy guns. I prefer a mini gun and now with wastelanders the gauss minigun or plasma caster is easlu obtainable after you faction grind
---
Nope nope nope. Screw you for even saying that, screw anyone who agrees...
---
Edit: I'm joking, but for the love of Atom please do not add sliders Bethesda, I am begging you, I can't take ticks... I don't need sliders...
---
Edit 2: I could go for some sliders, but not spiders.
---
I got the same weapon (Revolver) twice in a row and then another handgun. That char is a Shotgun/Sniper and I have a Gunslinger that could have used them.  
---
WoW had (IDK about know) mailboxes where you could send anyone almost anything as long as you had that char's name. BGS knows about that and of course wouldn't add it in. 76 is designed to be as big time sink as it can be.
---
Over an hour later, new public server still terminal only shows:
---
**Surveillance System Terminal** 
---
What gives?
---
Are you on Steam? Shift+Tab usually makes it act up, I usually just shift+tab again and its back to normal.
---
I really with Bethesda would make it so throwing knife or tomahawk would do more damage based on melee weapon you are wielding
---
perhaps a youtuber doing a "buy everything at random vending machines" video. just feel lucky :)
---
Might also be a mule storing a certain duped set of items, that they can almost have unlimited caps
---
I can personally confirm that I picked up a (Light) Robot Arms plan in the railroad car some ways down from Watoga Station towards NAR this week, and completed the Roboticist badge myself immediately after, so it is definitely available in the same pool and spawn locations as all the Marine piece plans in the Cranberry Bog, if rarely.
---
On a related note, it might've given me Legs too somehow, as I swear I don't remember having found those, but it was definitely an Arms plan.
---
Crickets or...
---
Am I shadow banned?
---
They‚Äôll likely Tesla you to death in that time, aswell as they‚Äôll be spamming quantum‚Äôs and other stuff?
---
I know
---
I just want to know how much I can do
---
I uninstalled it n reinstalled it. It Worked!
---
Holy shit I love this post, I have read it 2 times and it's just so good man.
---
The loot pool needs a fix to it if you ask me and that would be really cool to have a system like that. I never tried WoW but I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôd like it but I don‚Äôt want to pay for the game and then monthly for the character or whatever it is. I do agree they need to change the purveyor though that is for sure.
---
I've seen a level 900 during Scorched Earth once
---
I've wondered at times if things like this are done to reward existing players in a sense, before people who might be just getting into the game get theirs. 
---
I was also dropped on my head multiple times as a baby so who knows.
---
this is the comment i came for, idk either what STVI means, i wanna know now
---
If I followed your "rules" for vending, I'd have a single item in my machines. I regularly sell items priced at 15k+.
---
I'm afraid you're doomed to be frustrated. 
---
I do appreciate people sending me a message about cap limits, and frequently discount pieces accordingly. One player got an Unyielding Sentinel piece for 16k when it was priced at 25k because they were thoughtful and kind.
---
Wait... this game has lost an average of around 27000 daily players (from 33000 down to 6000) and you still think it's popular, let alone popular enough for that?
---
So if you kill the launcher before the nuke drops, it doesn't drop???
---
I will show up no matter what.  Won't be happy about it and will call you names though (off mic).
---
My long standing beef with the giant bat outweighs my dislike of radiation.
---
There‚Äôs a limit on how much damage you can do in one shot to a player, it‚Äôs something like 120, so that‚Äôs likely about half health, if you can spam stimpaks, you might be able to get a second shot off, but that‚Äôs likely it
---
I really don't know why. On paper they're supposed to preform the same but in my experience the slim is nearly always the worst. It seems to be the case for all the slim variants of the PlayStation systems in my experience. Maybe someone more knowledgeable could give a better explanation as to why since I can only speculate at best .
---
The problem is this is seen bybtoo many people as Yet another game that failed outright on launch, and just seems to keep tumling along from one failure to another. Vaultraids? Abandoned. Survival mode? Scraped outright. Nuclear winter? A glitch ridden pesthole full of hackers and sim bots ridding on a broken codebase that should have been shot and buried tears ago. Wastlanders? When somone everyone sees Bethesda‚Äôs biggest Fanboy describesWastlanders like taking one of his old games and putting it on top of crap....wellll it‚Äôs kind of hard to disagree with Matty
---
You just team invite everyone near the Queen and hope someone accepts to fast travel. I used this method and the vendors to open most of the map
---
Vendor eyebot. Three items max, your eyebot roams the wastes and when destroyed triggers a repair event mission, can repair it at the mission or from your camp but no rewards if from camp. Can upgrade it with flux to carry an extra item in shop, to move faster when roaming, enhanced weapons, or to explode like a nuke on death
---
Do People still play Everquest?
---
No idea, never heard of it.
---
I try to sell ultracite plans for 50 caps and they don‚Äôt move
---
I didn't even go to whitespring until I was lvl 40 üòÇ
---
She had already mutated, if that's what you're saying. I was also using the magazine glitch so I didn't have to reload. This video was just meant to show the damage that can be done. I'll be doing another full video in the next couple of days with no glitches
---
Is that a handmade with over 300 bullets in the magazine? Seems legit.
---
There‚Äôs a set of perk cards in perception that increase the area of an explosion. A set in perception that adds a throwing arc in, to help you aim.
---
Demo expert is in intelligence, which increases damage of explosives
---
Lol I'll be doing another full video in the next couple days that shows build and buffs
---
after level up, pick [the perk card](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/demolition-expert) in the INT section of your special. its available from lvl 10 on.
---
What level are you it is available from level 10?
---
There‚Äôs still people on Halo: Combat Evolved, and that came out in 2003. TF2, which came out in 2007, is still doing fairly well. It‚Äôll last for a while.
---
Lol see my other comment
---
NW:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer\_rank](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank)
---
As a melee player buy the Secret Service Underarmor plans. Patch 20 will add Linings for it which you can buy for more Gold. According to the PTS forums it gives you +4 STR, +4 EN and, +2 PER ... so +10 Stats in total, but the most important part is +4 STR. But its only worth it if you don't play with Power Armor.
---
There's no specific way to search for a server and get on the same one specifically unless buy FalloutFirst. But you can join someone else that's already in a server that way you can explore Appalachia together.
---
Until the left have cancelled everything and the internet is shut down, but then we can still play Fallout NV,1,2,3,4 until they cancel the power stations.
---
A tip I tried and worked is to gather several hundred dirty water (get ready to spam that gather key!) and drink it until you die. You should get a mutation, and if not, just do it again until you do. You will need to server hop between each mutation though, as you can only get one per session on each server. That and the Class Freak/Starched Genes perks maxed out! I got all the mutations that way (I got the Carnivore mutation so the Herbivore one won't apply). Hope this helps!
---
Bloodied and junkies build both need to be nerfed into the dirt.  I haven't done a queen in some time now since I can't get enough damage on the thing before some nerd decides to one-shot it.  
---
The bottom line is it's game-breaking, destroys other peoples' game experience, and needs to be addressed - pronto.
---
I believe they meant Free Range, which is the event where you actually herd and protect the brahmin. 
---
Riding shotgun is where you escort the caravan, which is the brahmin and the people. But yes, it is another good choice as it does guarantee a chance at a 3*.
---
Who's Matty?
---
Have you spent any your special points yet? The perk card system doesnt unlock cards untill you have spent points.  For example if you are level 30 but have saveda up 10 levels of points, than you will only see the perk cards that are available at level 20.
---
Also if remeber if you put a point into a given special such as strength,  you do not need to select a strength perk, you can scroll over and select a perk card from any special category.  For example qhen you level up you can add a special point rl atrwngth but pickup the action boy perk that falls under agility.
---
This does make sense, ah well, one can wish
---
You have to hit a damage threshold to get any loot with her. I believe the minimum you have to reach is 1k, but I could be wrong.
---
[Fire in the Hole](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_in_the_Hole) might be worth a look.
---
Rank 1  -  See a throwing arc when tossing thrown weapons, and they fly 15% further.  
---
Rank 2  -  See a throwing arc when tossing thrown weapons, and they fly 30% further.
---
That's the daily that gives you recipes for alcohol
---
You need to do more damage to it that what used to be needed. Having said that there could well be other issues going on. It seems to happen to a lot of people suddenly and frequently they are on PS4
---
You need to do at least 1000 damage to her, you can go to your settings to turn on the damage counter for each time you hit her.
---
That would give players more and less need to grind, grind = $$$
---
ü§ë
---
200 caps and free chest piece say "why not?". And they can sell some plans and flux.
---
You seem to to really be overreacting here  not sure how a free outfit not including a hat that was never advertised in the first place is ‚Äúslimy‚Äù lol
---
You have to keep doing his dailies until it rolls around to crafting that particular beer and youll get the recipe unlocked. I dont know if it follows a sequence or if its purely random.
---
It is ridiculously unbalanced. But thats because most of the community would rather see it completely removed then see it fixed, and Bethesda is too busy kissing their ass then keeping true to their vision of what an online fallout game should be.
---
You can run dedicated servers on both of those games. 76 does not have this option and it all depends on if Bethesda shuts down the servers.
---
The last 5 times I killed the SBQ and could loot her but no quest reward... 
---
I primarily do this for prime receivers and flux but I don't get any quest reward for completing the damn quest.
---
I got a prime mini gun i burned nearly 2000 bullets still nothing
---
What‚Äôs a mule account? Asking for a friend
---
Bethesda:
---
Bugs... Bugs never change...
---
&gt; The Whitespring Resort interior would be the perfect place for this. 
---
Wasn't that the original idea except a server/world instance could not handle the concentration of players in one room?
---
[Fire in the Hole](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_in_the_Hole) in Perception might be worth a look.
---
But [Grenadier](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grenadier) is also in Perception, available from level 35. This will give you the increased detonation radius.
---
And to craft **Nuka Grenades**, as you said you will need [Demolition Expert](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Demolition_Expert) which is *also* in perception.
---
Which is implying Bethesda will never let you run your own server eventually. If I remember correctly there was a co-op mod for New Vegas, and another mod thats aiming to do the same thing for Fallout 4 that‚Äôs currently in the works. So it‚Äôs possible, just not right now.
---
Haha. You‚Äôre sadly right. I can live with many of the smaller bugs. But this one makes my toes crumple
---
Yes, it's enough to fully restart the game. And that's the only thing that fixes it
---
you have no proof that clip you showed isnt using bobbleheads but go on, captainoob just posted another personal best solo kill.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKj3B_0juik
---
 the other video was on a team with buffs and bobbleheads.
---
That‚Äôs where you are wrong. They have acknowledged it. At least on r/fo76 they had replied and acknowledged.
---
&gt; Being a jack of all trades is counter-productive. Pick 1-2 styles of weapons at most and stick with it.
---
Laughs in auto-rifle / heavy weapon / explosives / sneak melee without having to switch perks. 
---
Seriously, except for the SBQ, you don't need to use 9 perks per weapon type. 3 is just fine.
---
Remember that unless you‚Äôre right up in her face when she‚Äôs on the ground, and with the high rate of fire on that gun, a lot of those bullets could be missing. Plus, the Queen has a lot of resistances, which means your bullets are doing less damage against her than what your Pip-Boy says.
---
It's an additional character created on an account whose main purpose is nothing more than holding weapons / armor / anything else that won't fit in the main character's stash.
---
If you want to absolutely shred enemies, damage per second is more important. If you want damage per shot you want a sniper. A handmade just wont pack the same punch.
---
Oh okay. 
---
I could do that for half a solution. 
---
Beth will probably have to look at it again if we want at least a 90% fix
---
Thanks! Didn‚Äôt know you could do that. May look into it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs frowned upon?
---
My main tip would be to enjoy yourself and don't try to be super performant. The cluelessness does not last forever and it's the best part about those games. People will try to give you many blueprints, ammo and healing items if they meet you while you're level 2 but that will just reduce the amount of game you can enjoy the game. 
---
Also: don't fast travel. The world is much bigger that way.
---
It's not breaking any rules.  Not sure if Bethesda cares one way or another.
---
I'm sure theres always gonna be a small dedicated player base, but it would mainly depend of how long Bethesda keeps the servers up, or if they give us the option to run dedicated ones
---
Not going to say what's already been said over and over but when she dies are you seeing xp being awarded?  If you received xp for the kill then you will be able to loot her.  I did have her not be lootable one time somewhat recently despite having done at least half the damage to her and receiving xp.  Waited a few minutes and killed some other stuff and then when I went back she had loot.  Seems to have been lag but that's the only time I've encountered it.
---
Now you can get a full day of gaming in
---
Well if you make the wall it only let you open from one side then you have to money around forever to get it to open from inside.
---
I did the same recently. Always good to help out people
---
And this one had it in its name.
---
I get this all the time. Was awarded 6 screws for Hemlock Holes, nothing in inventory
---
MrMatty is a youtuber
---
I wouldn't worry too much about those perks. 
---
Thet said they are looking to make changes.  They may very well change or remove it before it goes live.
---
Shielded to protect the furniture.
---
Wanna seeeell it to a junkie? :)
---
I wouldn't be able to resist trolling and being an asshole.
---
Hopefully
---
Unfortunately, weapons and armor that you‚Äôve nicknamed and dropped will lose the name you give them (other players can‚Äôt see it when trading or in vendors either), but your generosity helps new players‚Äô experience less rough starting out.
---
Biv. Biv is the brew master.
---
What level are you?
---
I'll personally only use it to be able to use the inspirational perk,during double xp.obviously doing my things...
---
The buffs are pretty much irrelevant and i already have my friends if i need someone to play with.
---
Walked right into that Raider ambush.
---
You would need to compromise game files (not save files, as those don't exist in a meaningful way for this game) to hack something into the game. Please describe how you would do that on console. ;-)
---
Your not missing anything it just sucks
---
I liked the 10mm shoulder machine gun aswell.
---
Agree and the bonus is they are also free fast travel, honestly if a teammate killing an enemy close by made you get the XP and be able to pick up the drops I would do more co-op because this isn‚Äôt the case I prefer to play solo for the most part.
---
  *noun* 
---
1. 1.a crushing or grating sound or motion."the crunch and grind of bulldozers"
---
2. 2.hard dull work."relief from **the daily grind**"
---
grinding is not meant to be fun
---
Like the other lad said, pressure plate on the inside is pretty common practice, and an easy fix. Bethesda has it's faults but camp building has a wholesome enough selection for ample adaptation and creativity.
---
Didn't people declare the game dead after just a few weeks, and here we are 18 months later with a 9 month roadmap? That alone is half the 5 year all but guaranteed and stretching out isn't impossible by any means.
---
Whilst they are still getting income from players connecting through Xbox Live, PS Store, Steam then it will almost increase the Lifespan of the game regardless of whether new content is forthcoming after that point.
---
In the unlikely event of a shutdown in the near future (&lt;10yrs) I doubt it would be released in a standalone single player version if only because the gaming world itself is going the complete opposite direction of always online connections and server based services included. Hopefully by that time a FO5 (or equivalent) will be around anyway that will fill the gap.
---
What's even worse is that the fifty limit is shared between players on your console. My fiance and I both play so each of us is limited to 25 pictures to keep it even.
---
Yeah so no godmode. Just buffs and bobbleheads and you can do that. That's what I've been saying the whole time so get that god mode stuff out of this
---
People are still playing Guild Wars and that came out in 2005.
---
Not many people but.. still. People are playing a 15 year old MMO.
---
I can launch one on whitespring if you like
---
It just works!?
---
Games are meant to be fun so grinding should be too.
---
The name grind is no excuse for boring repeating gameplay.
---
I actually gave up on it. Gonne get the rest when patch 20 goes live with something new to do.
---
That's exactly what's gonna happen. They live in a fantasy world if they expect mic people that will actively engage in plans and events knowing what to do.
---
People who do already have friends and teams. It doesn't take a new feature to find people to play with.
---
Nice
---
You are wrong. Of course possessions of others affect players in a multiplayer game, for example psychologically.
---
The specific issue with FO76 seems to be, that alot former single player play it and they are just not accustomed to being rankordered in videogames according to their progress, although someone would assume it happened to them in their life quite often like to most of us.
---
To make it very precise, there are deeply embedded mechanisms in our brain, who track status constantly and in that sense we are susceptible to relative deprivation. I would not know a single living being, who is exempt from that. 
---
It just seems, that single players, who are used to being the king in their games, sometimes have difficulties to cope with the reality of a shared game experience and all its implications.
---
All it took you for better performance ,was a ssd. Way cheaper than a whole pc.
---
Also enjoy the hackers.
---
Thank you so much, this is perfect
---
How can you do that, i've tried this but when i pick strenght for example it gives me a point in there only when i pick a card.
---
You are correct. Thanks
---
Why are you even.. never mind I don't wanna know.
---
While we‚Äôre at it there‚Äôs a bug that makes the hooded rags count as an armor set instead of an outfit even though it has no stats, so you can‚Äôt equip armor with it.
---
Lol im the same way the ticks freak me out and spiders would be worse but still peaks my curiosity
---
How about they do that AND make it so that in a loading screen it slides from photo to photo so I don't have to stare at ONE OUT OF 50!. WE HAVE 50 SLOTS BUT ONLY SEE ONE AT A TIME WTF
---
But now my curiosity...
---
Better idea let a player have so many characters to describe what/who they are catering too?
---
Yes, it does get more attention if these posts are more productive. If the upvotes get high enough it even gets a ‚Äògreat info. I shall pass this onto the devs!‚Äô from a community manager. So in effect being moderate and constructive gets you a virtual pat on the head, yet little actually changes. Do I support people mocking the devs? Generally not, but there‚Äôs always a place for satire. Do I understand their frustration? Absolutely.
---
Already seen it all.
---
Are you using the one that‚Äôs just the dome and no foundation?
---
Nooo isn‚Äôt do t
---
So how do you wire that up ?
---
Me and my friends are a small raider mercenary group. Kinda like talon company...but we aren‚Äôt dicks. Most of the time.
---
How do you get those as plans?
---
You should dep a link for everyone lol
---
Would love the old style gauss, but even just skins for the new one would be great. It‚Äôs my main weapon, so shouldn‚Äôt really look like such a rusty piece of crap.
---
For honor is somehow still being supported despite the small player base. It really depends on how dedicated the devs are.
---
Only thing I‚Äôve gotten from Fasnacht was a 3* Bloodied Bow with 50% Limb Damage and 90% reduced weight.
---
I gave it to a friend who was experimenting with a bloodied bow build.
---
Expect to see a lot more pushback on this once these are the only atom challenges left. I, somewhat cynically, expect them to be fixed with patch 20, though.
---
I tried to test this and found it was wildly inconsistent, so I've given up testing till I understand why my method wasn't working.
---
I mainly tested with a furious explosive automatic railway rifle, and found that sometimes I got one tick of bonus damage, sometimes 2. Sometimes I accidentally fired twice, and got 5 ticks of bonus damage...
---
I did some testing with a furious explosive harpoon gun with flechette mods, seeing if a single shot could trigger the max damage from furious... I never got max damage, and normally I only got one tick of furious damage, but sometimes I got up to 4 ticks from a single shot.
---
I don't have an explanation‚Ä¶ but my two idea's are that missing attacks (e.g explosive damage that doesn't hit the target) still does something to how many ticks of furious you earn... Or maybe it is a server lag issue, that too many damage equations at the wrong time get simplified and extra furious damage isn't always added. Don't know.
---
Not high lvl but not low lvl(40), but I'll drop my handle in case you want to team up on some xp grinding sometime psn: donjaydub
---
Glad to see the Roleplay scene is getting more traction.
---
As for 'created content'? Sadly i haven't done that in about a year, although i have multiple scenarios planned out that would definitely work out/get people interested in Roleplaying it out in-game.
---
That's definitely good thinking though OP, really bound to meet likeminded people who'd love to do that.
---
If you haven't already: BoS - Operation: h0pe4Future (A PC Only - Brotherhood group) does that kind of thing (Go on YouTube and type in the group name, you'll definitely take inspiration from them/enjoy their patrols)
---
u/Nymith is one of the main leaders of the group if any PC players are interested in joining the fun they have (I'm a Xbox player so I'm just merely spreading the word)
---
Speaking of which: Both u/Nymith and the ever-popular/great podcaster 'CHAD: A Fallout 76 Podcast' are both what inspired me to set my own group up/try to get things rolling 6 months ago. Wouldn't have thought about any of it without their support/suggestions.
---
I'm personally thinking of doing Twitch streams of my small Xbox Brotherhood of Steel Discord group roleplaying it out/roaming around in character. Things like that, i see a very sizeable PS4 roleplay group (New Responders - 5-0) do that constantly (Player created quests/activities etc) so it definitely works wonders.
---
+200 of 3 characters
---
What about you
---
Nice I've got one that's like 140?
---
Nice how long u been playing for
---
Wife got me the game for Christmas when it came out
---
No problem Waffle. Always happy to help.
---
That's cool
---
They might have if they landed a few good hits... i started trying to do them on my alt in his 30s (unarmed melee build) and I've gotten kill credit twice so far now.  The first time, I don't think i even did 200 damage, the second time someone froze her and I got to wail on her for at least 2K.  SO its possible the number you need to reach to get credit is a sliding scale... as I know just doing 200  dmg on my main won't cut it.
---
Oh god 100% no I don‚Äôt wanna have to make other people suffer like I have from thay
---
Yeah man I play when ever I can it's just usually on the weekends
---
I do this but not on this occasion. if I get multiple plans of the same thing and I‚Äôve already got one on sale, I‚Äôll just head to flatwoods and find a random mailbox and dump them in there. I‚Äôve also put them in the overseer crate at the overseer camp before. You‚Äôve given me an idea to just hop around the map and put random plans in different mailboxes as a surprise for people.
---
No no, you want them to, promise
---
Lol I play it most of the days
---
I don't know, I'm not a hacker and I don't own a console. But I do know all systems are compromisable, consoles of the last generation were breached at one point and I do remember playing against hackers on some shooters on the 360.
---
Hey man, give them some credit. The atom shop works flawlessly at all times!
---
Corrct special is only applied after you select a perk.
---
All im saying is you can pick whatever special you want to increase, but you do not have to grab a perk thats under thag special. You can pick any perk you have unlocked.
---
I'll be on a little more than usual this week. My wife is getting her wisdom teeth out Tuesday morning so I'll be taking a couple days off from work to take care of her and when she's knocked out I'll be grinding away lol
---
Ngl annoyed me a lil too so nice to see someone say something tbh
---
Mean lol
---
You should probably take tips on english if your going to gloat about something on an english sub
---
Hey man the season stars in Tuesday and they are putting her under with an IV not the gas so shes gonna be sleeping alot that day I think
---
Name is self-explanatory a hint to keep away üòù
---
U know when the pass is out?
---
The overseer crate is a great idea!  I'll start doing that.
---
nop
---
Oh and fix the Forest Scout Armor so its consistent with the Urban Scout too please.       
---
   
---
Currently you can only change Urban to Forest and back again via Paint. You cant do this with items that drop originally in Forest format.
---
Yeah. Thank you. You are one of those goons, who died as a loser?
---
I remember reading it somewhere and I'm pretty sure it will be like a month after but I hate even saying cause I really don't remember. I think if you go to bethesda and look at the page that lists the rewards for the season it has a bunch of info up at the top. That might be where I saw it
---
Yeah but I didn‚Äôt know it even existed until a bit ago and like I need whatever is stronger than eye bleach
---
Cheers
---
Satire?
---
At most until the next Fallout releases. But probably when the next Elder Scrolls comes out.
---
Or at least he will in the end.. i understood everything with no issues whatsoever, so they are just being assholes.
---
it is the LITERAL definition for the word grind though. 
---
If you just casually played the game for you know.. fun. It would be fun. But instead you're trying to do 3 or 4 months of casual gameplay in weeks. 
---
It's dull work. A grind.
---
Nah man what Bethesda should add in as well: Actual Fishing activity! 
---
I would definitely enjoy it. 
---
Is it boring?: Yep but i definitely would enjoy it. 
---
I liked it in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Far Cry 4/5. Something about it just makes it relaxing, ya know?
---
that just gave me a nice QoL idea; it'd be cool if we could see the total asking price value of what we have on sale...just because..
---
I don‚Äôt get it, I have one in my inventory called cryolator long barrel mod? Does it really mean the crystallizing barrel?
---
***English
---
***you're
---
***.
---
Thanks, found him. Think I prefer MrAngry Turtle.
---
Thanks you so much but I already found one server hopping, sorry for not updating the post but I thought no one saw it. Anyway as you did it!
---
Oh I know, hence my annoyance. I was carrying a TS 50l 15r combat shotgun as a backup on this character and I've got a b 50l doublebarrel on my bloodied build
---
enjoyed that, thanks! üëç
---
:D
---
OOOF! That's.. that's a bit of a mess innit
---
You need to manage your inventory better so you can get rid of some of those cards. 
---
Good with salt can go. 2 points can be used for killing and surviving. 
---
Some cards are situational and shouldn't be counted in a build. 
---
Super Duper, Travel Agent, Green thumb. Take those off. Sun Kissed is n't that great. Especially if you're running chemist backpack. You can carry all the radaway and rad-x diluted you need (using rad-x diluted prevents rads but DOES NOT suppress mutations)
---
Drop goat legs and either have another point in action boy/girl and i'd also get rid of white knight and get a point or two in adrenaline. Yeah your armour is gonna break quicker BUT you're gonna kill things easier and quicker. 
---
And er.. you wanna go either all in with heavy or shotgun. At the minute you're speccing into heavy, shotgun and melee. Go heavy with 1 in each shotgun damage and scattershot if needed.
---
bro if captainoob can kill the queen in 50 seconds with 3.75x sneak attacks and a bloody fixer without buffs, obviously a junkies with the same setup could make the same kill. once you get into caution solo with the queen is a cakewalk. doing massive damage when at a group queen is a totally different story.
---
Have fun. Certain things have a decent amount of grinding (like power armor) and I burned myself out on it just trying to grind to get good gear and didn‚Äôt really enjoy it? But now im playing it more like I did fo4 and NV with just exploration and lore and I‚Äôm enjoying it way better. So play your own play style and have fun. Also the community is relatively nice in game, Theres always someone willing to help it seems like
---
That‚Äôs some confidence for someone with a cheese weapon.
---
I get it that it's annoying and such when people try to attack your camp and such, but this posts feels like you're asking for a pro player to go to your camp and one shot you with their legacy ü§î 
---
But kudos to you lad if you can kill them too!
---
but u gotta appreciate the fact ur a worthy opponent if they need 4 people to (attempt to) kill u
---
@ 5000 bullion, nothing I want, I can't face any more rep grind and just play the game as if Wastlanders never dropped. More relaxing and fun.
---
I know right... I've been looking for a month, and no sign of him...
---
I sell lots of low to middling crap on my vendors and am lvl99 and Im not in a minority.
---
I sell what shifts not much high level items.
---
So dont see why player level is required.
---
You can always mouse over the player on the map to see what level anyway so not a big deal to check out their levels is it?
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature.
---
Sure, previous Playstation iterations have been breached at some point in time, but not PS4. If it's not happened in the last ‚Äìwhat?‚Äì seven years, it's unlikely to ever happen now. Sony's file system and hardware encryption are rock solid now.

Nah, its not. Explosive gatling plasma is way too powerful, only pvp-kings have to knowledge to counter it.

this post better than trump wall
---
legacy?
---
Well, that would be a worthy battle, that I dont mind.
---
I understand that. Many people aren‚Äôt aware of that so just trying to inform people, along with giving the prices so people that are wanting to buy the season outright know the price ahead of time. Just trying to help
---
Yeah, it is, unnerfed explosions effect.
---
Ah okay. I haven‚Äôt looked at it that way lol

I wasn‚Äôt going to but now that you mention it I kinda want to...

Well darn. I'm on PS4. I appreciate it though!

Well check one of the other threads on this post I have the link attached
---
Indeed it does lad
---
They will support it till the next Fallout game. ESO will see a huge drop when new TES eventually comes out. Looks like they released the online versions to trickle feed the fan base. 
---
Cyberpunk 2077 will be interesting. I think FO76 will suffer when that game in released.  
---
For me, I thought The Outer Worlds would end my FO76 obsession but they came and went with no DLC.
---
No it won't. I tried it with junkies/anti armor and damage difference is huge. You don't even get like 1/4 of the bloodied build. You can't pull that kind of big damage off with full health build. Try out for yourself and then come talk. Just try it out for fuck's sake invest 30 minutes and then we won't have to do this argument. I really don't get why you are so confident with misinformation you are coming up with
---
I use a B3325 Handmade and a full set of unyielding urban scout armor, I can get through anywhere else in the game, but I attempted to solo the queen and got her health down to about 20% before time ran out, reason I failed was because I kept dying to the rads she put off and because I was the only one there she went back to full health after I died. I do believe if it had the stealth suit during that fight (Or maybe even my rifle primed.) I would have won.
---
So I suggest to keep both on you and use them as the situation requires it. I can sneak through a nuke zone unnoticed with a basic b*tch prototype hazmat suit, so I imagine the stealth suit is much more helpful in that situation.
---
I'll probably hold off for a few days, and keep my eyes peeled to this sub to see how it's working out for people first.
---
if I jump right in, knowing my luck, I'll get griefed, teabagged, duped, glitched, banned and finally deported to some god-forsaken foreign land with only dial up internet..

---
pvpers keep forgetting they're a minority in here. you should be glad they didn't just do away with pvp completely, because that's what a huge chunk of the playerbase wants.
---
seems like you are splitting hairs when the difference is a 2 minute solo kill or a 45 second solo kill. bloody is the best damage, we all know that. that doesnt mean it completely outclasses full health builds against the SBQ, you were just saying a moment ago that the sbq is overrated but now youre back to saying only bloody is viable.
---

---
no legendaries in this 2 minute kill video, just OP sneak attack crits.
---
I got one of those magic weapons, some kinda instigating LMG with faster fire rate I think. Second best weapon I got? A TSE .44 Revolver. My first ever TSE drop in 1600 hours, and I‚Äôve been playing since the first Fasnacht.
---
Don't suppose your still on ?
---
Thats why i made this post the player base of pvpers is less than 1% but were still here. Pvp is part of the game and deserves to be looked at.
---
And we have a clip where bloodied is clipping queen in like 3 seconds. Difference is significant. That's how powerful low health build is
---
Ouch... hope you can get another one. One tip I have is to rename stuff you wanna keep and put a ~ before the name, it‚Äôll force it to the bottom of the list and lessens the chance of you scrapping it.
---
you really think wasting time and resources on 1% of the playerbase is a smart business move?
---
Well, all nine shotgun perks including skeet shooter for a start. Shooting from stealth can give up to 3.5x so all the sneak perks and finally, get an Instigating limb damage one. I can one shot Behemoths and 2-3 shot SBs when on the ground. Happy Days.
---
My mistake, I must have had some from challenges, they're definitely separate, but anything you buy with them is definitely central to your login so you get keep it if you move to Steam or vice versa, so people can wait until they've bought the things they want and have run out.
---
"There will be players that reach level 100 even in the first few days and probably on day 1. Some through exploits and some through legit grinding. Either way still has no bearing on your game at all."  
---
I care not for the achievements of others, I have zero interest in feeding the ego of people I do not know, or even those I do.
---
Pretty cut i missed out on survival mode! Man that sounds awesome. I'm by no means a pvp player but there is nothing more satisfying than killing another player, we can all go and kill the hardest boss in the game in 5 minutes and get absolutely no rush then complain about how there's nothing to do lol.   
---
On the very rare occasion i find myself in a pvp situation there's nothing more satisfying than duking it out and killing someone, even if they get me 10 times before i get them once its still one of the funnest things in the game, wish there was a way that pvp and pve could co exist without anyone getting upset!
---
Only for a few minutes.  It's up and running for me
---
Is there any perks you would suggest if I want to play vats but not critical shot and sneak. I wish to shoot more with vats and I found that the ap goes too fast and reload too slow even when I use action boy and lone survivor
---
"**Add player's level next to his name when mousing over his camp".**  
---
Did you just assume a players gender?  
---
But yeah, levels of all players on the map, either them only or their CAMP, need to be displayed at all times.
---
Groups of higher level liberators are no joke, they will mess your health bar up quick with how fast they shoot those lasers.
---
I had a similar situation once.  Minding my own business looting screws at sugar Grove and kept hearing shooting a few rooms over. After 2 straight minutes I decided to go check out just what the hell was making so much noise.  Found a level 30 player backed into a corner frantically trying anything they could not to get killed by 2 Colonel Gutsies.  Killed them both to help him out and he gave me a heart emote lol.
---
Mr. Cheng, tear down this wall!!
---
Then your player icon should be a donkey
---
yeah im on pc. part of their name was like iron something.
---
I tried tping twice but i think their floor was broken or something cause everything was floating.
---
did you watch the clip i linked? thats not junkies, thats NON LEGENDARY and a combat rifle. if the queen landed and stood still for him like in captainoobs video, he would have killed it under 60 seconds. why are you so convinced all your damage is from bloody builds and that its not from the big sneak attacks when you have the proof right in front of you. even captainoob commented on the video I linked.
---
Every time I do Riding Shotgun the captain is always 3* for me during the first run with Kieran and Eugenie. That event is always fun, and you can replay it every 45 minutes. Plus the captain is always level 95 to 100, so you‚Äôll always get max level gear from them, their minions are all above level 60 as well and they have a chance to be legendary too.
---
You didn't notice someone placing something on your character?  
---
Do you not have any degree of spatial awareness? Were you AFK?  
---
Strange, very strange.
---
I'll give it a gander~ Thank you ^^
---
I don't feel you need sneak attack boost. i personally don't use it and have no problems killing anything. I use scattershot for the reload speed and weight reduction so i can carry 2 backup shotguns. 
---
I would put at least 1 point in adrenaline and gun fu. Extra damage.. just in case. I do run enforcer 3 with mine so in the chance i don't kill something it's more than likely getting crippled. Really handy for events with waves of enemies. Really good in radiation rumble as i can aim at the ground in front of 3 or 4 ghouls and either kill or cripple them.
---
Ah, the ol' infinite monkey theorem. Classic. Can't say it doesn't feel a little true sometimes with the number of issues we regularly encounter.
---
Nope.
---
i added you as a friend also\~
---
It should last for at least several more years, just through momentum and Fallout fandom.  Im curious where they're going to be taking it though, they didn't give themselves much wiggle room for new top end items after wastelanders.
---
Its 1% because of what they have done. Theres probly not much more than that that plays nuclear winter but they pay attention to that don't they?
---
Yeah me too since I crafted a good Gauss shotgun I need them a lot since the weapon tends to shred in my hands quickly
---
Well yeah and it's doing shit damage. If you was running low health, queen would be dead when she landed the second time, first time if you are buffed up fully. Just go and try soloing the queen. Don't bring me some clips try out for yourself ffs and feel the power
---
Agreed i want everyone to be happy and play the game together
---
Could you imagine a Radhog. Think of the glowing green bacon on that.
---
No agility?
---
If you see me on, I have a lot of plans for sale for about 10 caps each. Just buy what you want. I don't see the point in doing a trap camp, so don't worry about that.
---
Please I beg you......paragraphs and tl:dr;
---
On PC here. Happens to me here and there with my Gatling laser and Gatling Plasma. Ammo runs out in current core and the barrels will keep spinning and not fire or just plain stop and nothing happens. Have to initiate reload by hand. Or the gun will stop shooting halfway through a core and I have let let go of the trigger and start again with that condition. But most of the time the reload sequence will start on it's own. It's so random.
---
There's definitely something broken with the social menu with people reporting not seeing their friends list, I'm on PS4 and last night I had a blue screen crash opening up the social menu at Foundation.
---
not really. it hasn't been updated since release except for a new map and hackers run free on pc. they keep forcing challenges down people's throats so they have something to do once the grinding gets too much, which is usually instantly.
---
I've been playing since release and did my fair share of pvp. it was never as popular as revisionists imply and the majority of the playerbase always despised it.
---
from any angle you look, catering to pvpers is a stupid idea.
---
What about super mutant and deathclaw with a hint of eyebot
---
Thanks for doing this!!

When the XB1 is ready I'd love to visitüíó

---
It happens. I accidentally scrapped my peppered tenderizer the other day too, not too happy about it but nothing can be done about that now...
---
Am I the only one who finds the camp and then looks around the map for the corresponding player? It only takes me a like a minute or so to find most players and see their level. I've also found it doesn't really matter anymore. I've found low levels selling great shit and high levels with nothing but overpriced garbage. Level used to be a good indicator of what's for sell but lately (especially with all the alts and mules) it doesn't seem to make much difference.
---
I'm not opposed to the idea of adding level to the camp mind you, but I think BGS has much bigger fish to fry. And at the rate they're going, seems like no one is getting a nice fish dinner anytime soon.
---
On PC it is like 1k damage, that should be enough.
---
I- idk
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure but I think an easier way to explain it would be with other effects. 
---
Furious stacks on an extra 10% damage for every hit up to a limit of 5 stacks, so furious does an extra 50% damage. Junkies is the same with 10% damage added for every addiction to a max of 5, so again 50%. Bloodied however does way more damage than junkies. So if junkies was 50% damage, I imagine bloodied would be 70% extra damage when you‚Äôre at 20% health. 
---
If you need a good number for your health, I‚Äôd say just keep your health at 20% to get the most out of bloodied. 20% is when Nerd Rage and Unyielding Armor activates, and when adrenal reaction and your bloodied weapon start pumping out serious damage.
---
Nah, it just a legit legacy. It is overpowered, thats true.
---
Only time will tell on that one, whilever it makes money I suspect they will run it. 
---
Ultima Online is still going and that started back in '97.
---
They've updated it multiple times with balances and changes to weapons and items. If they did the same to adventure pvp it would be just as successful but they only listen to people who dont care which is just as bad of a business decision.
---
getting better, but that's just an average day for a furry. I've seen some pretty enticing deathclaws.
---
anything involving, I don't know, easy pete? and maybe bodily fluids and you're going too deep.
---
Fallout has been single player since 88 (wasteland), BGS's one and only venture into pvp was a huge trainwreck and unwanted by most of the franchisees fans. I personally feel pvp is a cancer and 76 needs to be cured of it. 
---
There's tons of pvp games out there, why do people continue to try to keep it in game all this time? Stacking meds to become invincible? The level of kek on this is proof the pvp is broken enough to be removed permanently. 
---
The level of pvp zealots (no pun intended) and their obsession over pvp in the game is commendable but bordering on a religion. I want all of BGS's resources to go to fixing that trade bug that's been there for a year, and other long term bugs to help the game, not so jimmy and his friends can drink 90 quantums and shoot someone else in the face. pvp takes resources away from the real game.
---
You could also just find their dot on the map and see it that way
---
These are important. I use them for my Marine Armor (bad, I know, but grants like +50 to carry weight).
---
Don‚Äôt think it would help. I still waste countless caps going to lvl 150+ players camps and they have a full stock of.. pipe rifles, combat rifles, lead pipes, etc etc.. I‚Äôd rather a factor where it shows how many legendary items are in a players camp.
---
My question is, who are you to try to censer what people want to say on here? No matter how cringe worthy, they have the right to express themselves. Just like you.
---
Sorry lol i hardly post im just getting some information out there.
---
Damage is limited. ROF on bows is super limited. 
---
It‚Äôs not a PVP weapon at all.
---
Lol what, this has to be a joke.   
---
It's literally like 10 public events for the daily 200 bullion (not including the welfare treasury notes you get from dailies), if you aren't doing that many events per day then wtf exactly do you do on 76?
---
Not until they add more outfits lol
---
If they‚Äôre taking away weekly and daily challenge atoms, then I want repeatable Combat challenges for 40 atoms each. I‚Äôd totally go around the many blood eagle camps around the map and kill 1000 blood eagles for 40 atoms. Soon as the challenge completes you get another one that‚Äôs the exact same, kill 1000 more blood eagles for 40 more atoms.
---
(As long as it doesn‚Äôt say do it with a specific weapon... I recently destroyed 16k robots for the robot Combat challenges and that was rough.)
---
I used to think Lone wanderer the same. I solo, and on most characters I learned to live without it. Points saved went to either fireproof or bloody mess. With full set of  3* unyielding and armored backpack helps. Now with my OP tank/unarmed Melee. It's still used and only at first level.
---
&gt;but they only listen to people who dont care which is just as bad of a business decision.
---
yes, they listen to the majority of the playerbase. that's the opposite of a bad business decision. because the people who do care about pvp are nowhere near profitable enough in comparison.
---
"multiple times" is also an overstatement. a couple nerfs here and there and no new content in ages except for 1 (one) new map doesn't qualify "multiple". the thing is still in beta after all this time, in fact. probably because dedicating resources to a less competent BR that's essentially an afterthought is also not a smart business decision.
---
it's also not as easy to tweak adventure. the weapons in NW are literally different weapons. NW tesla is not the same as adventure tesla. there's no "pvp" switch that you can turn on to apply nerfs and buffs to particular mechanics. if they nerf, say, chameleon in order to appease the 1%, they'd \* up everyone else in the process.
---
Fire fire fire fire!
---
Where do you get the plans for this? Been after it for a bit lol
---
Meanwhile he walks by my camp and ends up in a fight with one of my turrets, and proceeds to start destroying my entire camp, every damn week
---
I mean ESO still gets huge additions but that's a lot less "contentious" than this game
---
No, it really doesn't. PvP in a fallout game is a joke. How is spamming quantums, stealthboys, and stimpaks remotely fun to play against? 
---
I've done PvP a grand total of twice. Once when I was a lower level, taking the Ammo Workshop. Dude comes in with the intent of ruining my day, hopping all over the place and shooting me with his exploding bullet combat rifle and every time I am about to kill him, he does stimpak spam. Couldn't aim to save his life, but boy could he spam those stimpaks. So I just gave up trying to kill him, I would be wasting resources at that point, and being low level and not having much, it was pointless. 
---
The other time, same workshop, dude comes, but this time I've got good stuff. I kill him no problem. Then he calls in his buddy and it is two on one, but this time stealth boy spam is involved. Kinda hard to win when you can't see them, but they can see you. 
---
PvP is garbage in Adventure, let it die and stick to NW.
---
Forever or five years
---
I appreciate the work you put into this. Thank you!
---
I was getting some strange numbers too and am glad that this has been independently verified.
---
amen
---
would give you an award if I wasn't broke
---
Explosive is better damage per shot. Faster fire rate is better damage over time.
---
I like explosive, personally.
---
I don't think there are plans for it, I have it from the atomic shop
---
Thanks. Maybe a problem with my isp. They've been having issues all week
---
If the game never had pvp to begin with then it wouldnt matter. I play other pvp games but this game is still fun. They created this mess and they should fix it along with all the other stuff that has gone relatively untouched. The "real game" is just a grind fest. Everyone enjoys things differently. The economy is destroyed anyway the resources are in the millions.
---
If you don't find anyone real soon I'll be on in a little while. GT: jss125
---
Yea thats understandable , but the guy was just talking from his perspective
---
PvP is fun. I had an awesome battle with a guy at the dirt track workshop the other day. I killed him 3 times and he never got me. I think he rage quit after the third time. He had his base close so he was calling in artillery on me lol. But the damage cap is ridiculous. My bloodied explosive black powder rifle shouldn‚Äôt do the same damage as my fixer or assault rifle.
---
Oh God my cryo later breaks so oooo fast
---
He made a post with a suggestion for the game, speaking about all the players in it. He exclusively used the words he, him and his. This is a very simple thing to understand. Why do you feel the need to ‚Äòexplain‚Äô it to me?
---
Just an FYI as long as you have a nuke key card you can just stroll into a silo and launch a nuke without bothering to decipher anything by looking up the weekly codes on sites like Nukacrypt.
---
youre calling a sub 2 minute solo kill shit damage? lmao you havent shown any videos of your work, get outta here with that BS.
---
Because OP did nothing wrong , and most likely plays with other males , you are complaining over nothing
---
Explosive energy weapons bypass the dense torso mod and the fireproof perk.
---
Literally, they are broken. Do not function as they should.
---
It's one of the reasons they were removed.
---
Are you serious? The game relies so heavily on the entirely broken SSR so much that even the water texture itself in included? No wonder the performance is so bad and yet the visuals are also so bad.
---
I did notice this occurs when it loads up a parital charge core. It'll start showing a higher ammo count than it should have, then runs empty early, like say at 27 rounds left. This kept getting worse and worse if I kept using it without swapping weapons.
---
If they are too lazy to build anything at all they could use that Personal Terminal. Allow people to browse through list of players in a server and see their vending items and prices. We won't be able to buy remotely though, just an option to bookmark their camp location to actually get the item
---
That is good information to have.  How did you find this out since it does not say it does in game, unlike the wetsuit that does indicate that.
---
It‚Äôs just fallout
---
They could just as easily remove nuclear winter and people would post things like this about it. Imagine if they removed adventure mode and left nuclear winter. The game would completely flop. An economy doesnt grow from a monopoly it grows from diversity. Call of duty doesnt have only team deathmatch they have like 20 different modes. Everyone enjoys something different from the man next to them.
---
My main advice is have fun. Most players are there to play themselves and will help you because they were in your shoes once. If you run into griefing, block them, hop worlds and you'll probably not see that again for a while.
---
I correct you, its just Fallout 76!
---
Bethesda is saying they appreciate your business. Complete standard for fo76.
---
No, YOU are complaining over nothing, and defending something that doesn‚Äôt need defending. In a literal sense, OPs gendering of ‚Äòplayers‚Äô is incorrect. This is annoying to the many, many women who play video games, mostly because it constantly happens, and also because there‚Äôs always some dude like you who comes in honking OVERSENSITIVE when someone points it out. It‚Äôs tiresome. But you keep bleating, little cheeper.
---
Its less, but honestly its also more if you have already completed all the non-repeatable ones. Doing all your daily and weekly challenges for the duration of time of the season will be going would net you less atoms before the season than after the season starts.
---
I‚Äôm seeing people here saying they‚Äôll join a team just to do their own thing which makes no sense to me. If you want to do your own thing then play solo, what‚Äôs the point of taking up a spot on a team if you have no intentions on even playing with those people? Some of you really need to stop being so damn anti social and selfish
---
To be fairrrrrrrrrr
---
A man of culture I seeeee.
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve ever said but I would assume as long as it stays popular
---
 What? Over? Did you say 'over'? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!...
---
Yes. You're literally taking up more of your own time to waste a little of theirs while they load into a new world. Only point I see would be to send a message, I guess.
---
Also. What platform are you on?
---
RNG be like that sometimes
---
Xbox
---
The SBQ is no different than another other 3* mob in terms of legendary drops. She's a slot machine.
---
Welcome to RNG
---
Give this man a medal! (Or if he‚Äôs on Xbox give him my GT and I‚Äôll give him some HCA and weapons)
---
I don‚Äôt read walls of text but will say I do wish other players could pose a threat but it would need to be completely reworked and balanced. 
---
I just wish more people played hunter hunted. That event can be pretty exciting.
---
So you are getting offended that OP uses ‚Äúhis‚Äù when the majority of people that play games are men? I don‚Äôt care that women play video games , the more the merrier , i care that people are so petty and get offended over nothing , im defending him because he did nothing wrong
---
They created this mess and now were stuck with it whether anyone wants it. Everyone is scared of fighting in a game thats post apocalyptic and everything is trying to kill you. What pvp has become is stupid and why i made this post about it. Pvp to me is as adventure mode is to most people.
---
There's something about MMO's and PvP real talk. I am yet to see one where the community doesn't get divided. Massively. 
---
You're either PvP or PvE.
---
Personally, I'd prefer all PvP left the overland story world. Outside of a workshop, the shit doesn't exist. That's my perfect world.
---
Sorry OP but I believe NW will be as far as it goes and probably be an after thought to overland content.
---
While you're absolutely right, and anyone who goes through the trouble of learning the English language should learn to use the proper, inclusive terminology, it's still a good thing to keep in mind that there are languages in the world, such as, for example, mine - Finnish - which do not have gendered pronouns, and then when typing something in English whilst doing the translation on the fly, it's sometimes easy to just have a small, unintentional lapse in judgment and default to using he, him, his. This is made easier in Finnish since our word for "he/she" is "h√§n", which starts with an "h", just like "he". Having said that, I have no idea about the OPs native language. Just thought it'd be worth pointing this out, though.
---
Also, as a small aside, in Finnish, in common speech, we actually almost always call everyone "it".
---
Hunter/hunted is great and is exactly what survival was like but on a large scale. They have the tools to make something amazing.

thanks bro I added you

Ive spent a good few hours each day this week looking for a simple junkies handmade...
---
It's a metaphor for the gold bullion farm i guess
---
&gt; would you think I do good damaged for pvp or no
---
No, because the dmg is capped at 120 / shot. Do the math yourself and consider your reload time. Can you get off 4 or 5 shots in less than a second?
---
There will always be a split in what people enjoy i wish they could make pve and pvp work together but i doubt it would happen in adventure after what its become.
---
Dude. Calm down. Wow, you‚Äôre getting really worked up. Are you okay? Emotional time for you right now?
---
Yes , it is thank you

This is one thing I love with playing on PS4, the amount of wonderful people I come across, instead of those being jerks is high. I'm just saddened I can't ever take the team invites they give me because I have to stop playing constantly to deal with my children! I love running into people in this game just for the polite social emoting lol.
---
There will come a time when you'll be purposely trying to expel ammo and resources because you just have too much.
---
Look man. Whatever damage you are doing with that 3.75 sneak multiplier, low health build does 3 times that. 2 minute kill? impressive. But put that next to 3 seconds kill
---
Step away from it for a day or two, play a different game, something that isn't anything like 76. It's nice to take a break every now and then.
---
I was in the same situation yesterday, ran that same mission about 10 times and had dc issues every time.
---
I played some different games, watched a movie, just vented the rage. üëç
---
It's a feature, not a bug.
---
You could still hit enter once in a while, you know, just to make the rant readable?
---
Never used one, is it good?
---
It's a live service game its gonna crash sometimes. I generally have one crash every decent lengthed play session. But that's how it been since fallout 3 and that's not even live service. If you need help on supplies I can help you and make ammo for you of it would help. Just try to get past the crashes. They are an inconvenience at most
---
‚Äú there are no mistakes, just happy little accidents‚Äù - bob ross
---
Right now (and since Launch), you can‚Äôt discover workshops.....so yeah, it‚Äôs a bug.
---
Im no writer but its readable.
---
I love how if you stop by them, alot of the time I'll have one just turn and stare at me, it'll growl and then walk off.
---
Sometimes they don't register for some reason. If you make an alt and discover it again it should tick it off for you.
---
if they make the matching hat to the veteran player reward paid instead of just unlocking it it really shows how they feel about us veteran players.

Awww manüò≠
---
Thanks for the clarificationüëçüññ
---
It‚Äôs prob got another 2-3 years left in it.
---
If in doubt try putting it on a rug.
---
We know they have the next year planned. Can't say after that
---
&gt;They could just as easily remove nuclear winter and people would post things like this about it.
---
the BR audience isn't necessarily the pvp audience. you're ignoring a ton of variables and just assuming players killing players is all the same. NW attracts more people than survival and pvp in general ever did, which is not saying much.
---
&gt;Imagine if they removed adventure mode and left nuclear winter.
---
imagine if they removed the thing the majority of the playerbase plays? yeah, I imagine the game would flop. you don't say. now imagine if they removed pvp from the game completely: nothing happens except for some minor backlash for a week and a ton of happy pvers.
---
&gt;An economy doesnt grow from a monopoly it grows from diversity.
---
not necessarily. the game is in a dire state as it is. they clearly don't have, or don't want to spend the resources to fix adventure. and no matter how much they invest in survival, the Fallout playerbase will **never** be pvp-focused. on top of that, no one will pick Fo76 pvp over far more competent player versus player games out there. the NW playerbase is the same as the regular playerbase. people don't go "oh, I want to play a BR. what should I play? Fortnite? PUBG? nah, I'll go with Nuclear Winter!"
---
no matter how you look at it, no, it's not profitable. Bethesda all but said so themselves.
---
&gt; Call of duty doesnt have only team deathmatch they have like 20 different modes.
---
which are all variations of the same thing. it's either pvp, coop or BR. which adds to my previous point by the way, no one buys Fo76 *just* to play NW. I can see that being the case with CoD. but most definitely not 76.
---
&gt; Imagine if they removed adventure mode and left nuclear winter. The game would completely flop.
---
That is completely bollocks and proves imho that zealots can't see the tree in the forest.
---
What gun/s do you use? I can hook you up with some ammo. And some aid if needed.
---
I know it's shit having to do it again but.. well.. nothing inspirational to say really other than just do it again. Crashes do happen unfortunately.
---
Why would steam be gone?
---
I was under the impression it was a matching hat and bugged but to unlock in the future.
---
thats not my video lol. if you wanna see how I kill the queen, watch some of angryturtles streams and you will see me in the group sometimes. I have a huge legacy floating camp at delta that the queen will land on and we do the whole fight on my floating foundations.
---
Germans??
---
Thicc.
---
Check your atom shop. It‚Äôs missing a storefront image but it‚Äôs there.
---
believe me ... there still more .... just wait for it
---
Steam went down a few hours ago, and everyone is saying it's back now but I still can't login to the client so.. :(
---
I‚Äôm assuming it was the guys in-game name. But it took me googling it first to make sure it wasn‚Äôt some AFAIK or TIL equivalent that I just wasn‚Äôt aware of.
---
Okay, thank you so much!üíó
---
I'll go give that a try....and I'll let ya know how it goes!üòª
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm the same. I even made an alt and it didnt work for that either. I don‚Äôt know what the deal is.
---
I think Xbox has a messaging system. Probably easier to actually thank him directly.
---
Sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. 
---
I‚Äôd like to give you an example of why being constantly overlooked is not ‚Äònothing‚Äô, in hopes you may understand why women gamers get so frustrated with this scenario. 
---
So. There are plenty of studies and statistics that willl tell you that the gender split for gamers is about 46% women to 54% men. Sure, technically a majority, but hardly by an overwhelming landslide. 
---
Let‚Äôs flip it around and I‚Äôll give you a ‚Äòhow about this.‚Äô Picture this for me. There are 100 people standing in a room. 54 of them are women. 46 of them are men. A speaker gets up on stage and greets you all. ‚ÄúHELLO GIRLS! How are all you ladies today?‚Äù And then they spend the whole day talking to the room, addressing you all as women, constantly. ‚ÄúGirls, gals, chicas‚Äù. Every time a woman talks to you, she says something like, ‚ÄúHey sis, how‚Äôs your day going?‚Äù 
---
So you try to point out that basically half the room are men, and you yourself are a man. And a bunch of women in the room immediately turn on you with ‚ÄúoMg uR mAkInG a bIG dEaL oUt oF nOtHiNg‚Äù. And that‚Äôs the answer you get, every time, while all day people keep speaking to you as if you‚Äôre a woman. 
---
Now imagine that happens every day, every room you go into, all tells time. You don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd find that tiresome?
---
Man of culture and class, would ya look at that!
---
Awww jeeze that sucksüò£
---
I'm sorry to hear thatüíó
---
I'll keep at itü§û
---
üëçüññ
---
Don‚Äôt be ‚Äúthat‚Äù internet guy. There are many games that feature grinds that are fun, challenging, entertaining, etc., so saying that the bullion grind, as is, is okay just because of the dictionary definition of ‚Äúgrind‚Äù is silly.
---
Also it‚Äôs my understanding to reach the dmg threshold, dmg to her minions count and you will get high dmg hits on them
---
So make sure to help clear trash while she is in flight? Is my understanding
---
I already did. I just wanted everybody to know that there is still hope in humanity
---
They gave us all a free outfit lol. Man the entitlement is real.
---
Yeah it actually doesn‚Äôt take that long tbh.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt bother me if im completely honest , i would find it funny
---
Did you see the photo of the outfit when they told us we were getting the free veteran outfit? Did you see a hat in that photo?
---
It's the principles. Some countries and businesses have them, and some don't.. Look no further than the state of the world (even just smaller to alot of other games Ips like silent hill) to why that's important.
---
They are close to finishing. 12 plans left I think
---
Yay!!!!ü§ìüíóüíï
---
Hmm, ima try a commando style soon then. Thanks!
---
Yes, that‚Äôs true. I didn‚Äôt know that about Finnish; thank you for the fun fact. However ... it‚Äôs also a generous and unlikely explanation for something that‚Äôs incredibly common in the gaming world. Have you ever heard of the theory of Occam‚Äôs Razor? It basically boils down to: ‚Äúthe simplest explanation is usually correct.‚Äù In the gaming world, there is a wide - and incorrect - assumption that the majority of players are men. 
---
Ask any woman who games a question about whether she feels included in the community. They will mostly tell you they do not. And while OPs post is hardly an example of anything insidious or insulting - in fact, it‚Äôs just a lazy oversight - it‚Äôs the first step on a spectrum of assumptions that are tiresome, repetitive, exclusionary, and *constant*.
---
Deathclaws? Now we‚Äôre talking.
---
I totally boycott these assholes, because they are the reason we get more and more limited when building our camps.
---
They should be banned and reported on sight.
---
Okay, I can see you can‚Äôt be bothered to give this any thought deeper than a teaspoon. Good day to you, sir.
---
&gt; Is this just a game to tide us over until fallout 5 or is this the kind of game they will update continuously over the next decade or so?
---
Before Fallout 5, they need to make Starfield first, which does not have a release year yet, then The Elder Scrolls VI in a few more years, then another few years is realistically the soonest for Fallout 5. So, it could be about a decade either way. Perhaps 76 would be abandoned sooner if the number of players drops too low for the game to remain worth updating. But it took years even for ESO to become really successful, so whatever the decision is about the future, I do not think it would be rushed.
---
I'm on now, what's your GT?
---
Came here for this comment. ‚Äî a female Fallout fan.
---
Since you are interested, let me share my unproven theory, it's pretty simple, and starts by thinking of two "facts"
---
1- At release, any missed shot would reset your furious weapons damage, this was changed so that consequtive hits on the same target stacked damage for a period of time. Working as intended? Or bughtesda'd?
---
2 - explosive weapons "splash" damage around the target, they damage you if you are too close, and they send objects flying.
---
My guess is that the number of furious damage ticks added is like a total score, the number of hits on a target, minus the number of hits that miss the target, with a minimum of one as long as you hit.
---
So my flechette harpoon gun fires 5 explosive projectiles, but even if every projectile hits, the wide splash damage of explosive miss more than 5 times, so I only get 1 extra tick of furious, unless I get a lucky hit. That's a fairly complex damage calculation, so that's why I think server stability also plays a role. A final bit of complexity is that tooltip damage may not be the same as actual damage.
---
It wasn‚Äôt in a bundle but it was an Atom shop outfit back in March (I think?) and prior to that. All I can suggest is to be patient and keep an eye on the Atom Shop, especially the last ‚ÄòS.P.E.C.I.A.L‚Äôs tab.
---
I missed the Nuka Quantum Bottle Lamp, Nuka Cooler &amp; Bottle Mascot so I‚Äôm waiting on those.
---
I did that but at level 12 lmao. Twas the funniest shit ever
---
Your level has no impact on camp budget.
---
I didnt do over 1000 damage when I fought it at level 12 and got the full rewards when it was killed
---
That's just it. When i say slimy business practices its cited as mainly their new marketing division. Bethesda know full well from the horse armor debacle and have only pushed the envolop ever since with even less and less transparency. All the devs made the first Christmas bundle that came out in atom store to be intended as a free gift for players being in the spirit of Christmas eg.. Then the marketing team pulled the idea and stuck it all in the grossly over enflated Atoms store.
---
Definitely lots of great people in this community!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
By definition alone if a grind is fun it's not a grind.
---
I don't make the rules
---
Interesting, so would a more controlled weapon like a mini gun would be a better test matrix?
---
You have to roll for a looot of pieces though,lol
---
camp budget is a set amount that does not change unless Bethesda tweaks it and tells us in a patch (e.x. turret change: they limited turrets by #, but reduced the budget each one cost)
---
here is a nice guide (even though its a bit old) to help you ballpark your budget needs
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Ok. Thank you
---
I'll look at this thank you.
---
until late october 2077 i guess? ;)
---
I think the whole "veteran oufit" thing already does. It's the last example if anyone still had any doubts.. Oufit, broken for months. Hat, even more broken for months. Then likely pulled to resell back to us at a later date.. All on the premise as a Sorry and thank you for sticking with the game as broken as it was for over the first year and continuing to financially support Bethesda with FO1st subscriptions and Atom purchases.. And people just keep letting it slide.
---
I have noticed this too, it's probably the same players but we just don't remember usernames lol
---
Its the quest reward from finishing Ella Ame's research, i think the quest is called Organic Solutions. Her bunker is in the mire, top right hand corner of the blackish area on the right hand side of the map above cranberry bog.
---
What?
---
LOL I love stuff like this. 
---
About two weeks ago I (lvl 85 at the time) came across a lvl 10 guy stumbling around the toxic valley, clearly over encumbered, about to get munched on by a snallygaster. I helped him out and guided him to a bench to scrap his junk. We teamed up for the extra XP. 
---
Then someone launched a nuke. Without thinking twice I fast traveled to the nuke zone to fight the queen. Then he joined me. 
---
I'm pretty sure he didn't know what he was walking into. Over voice chat, I hear him whimper, "mommy!!!"
---
He actually managed to stay alive even though he didn't do enough damage to get the drop from the SBQ.
---
He and I still play, and in just two weeks he's managed to grind all the way to lvl 50. Props.
---
No worries, I have the ‚ÄòSettler Wander‚Äô ally dressed up in it in my C.A.M.P and the outfit looks great. Hope you don‚Äôt have to wait too long!
---
Desperately needs? Dire need? sucks theres no one to trade with
---
You answered your own question, if they have the right to voice their opinion, then so do I.  Hence this post. I didn't demand anything of anyone or try to "censor" anything. 
---
I asked, nicely, to not immediately get mad and run to reddit to complain about essentially nothing.
---
Not only does it not take long, notes are essentially gifted to players for completing events they should be completing anyway.   
---
I don't understand how doing events like Scorched Earth, Project Paradise, Encryptid, One Violent Night, Path to Enlightenment or any of the other lower level public events are even considered a grind? The ones listed have guaranteed legendary mobs and are great xp, if people are complaining about literally playing the fuckin game just play something else
---
they don't really need anyone to respect it. the 5 of people paying for atoms covers their bills, especially now as we're going to have fewer atoms thereby forcing those who spend them to buy more.
---
The naming system is a little weird, but the few secondary/tertiary effects that can override the primary's name on an item only seem to affect the Assassin's prefix. I can't recall the last time that i saw a Powered, Safecracker's, Cavalier's, Sentinel's, or Acrobat's prefix on a piece of armor that wasn't Assassins.
---
Returning player after...awhile. How do we get through the floor?
---
Add bugfixes as Atom Store purchases, so they will *actually work on them!!*
---
Thanks for this - it almost worked, though I may need more energy to try again. Got two in two hops, then the containers rolled as empty, and I spent the next six hours pulling all the hearts and lungs in the land.
---
that would be great. i see so many paints that look epic but can‚Äôt use
---
You need to do some research into all of this. It isn't "just a hat"... Check out YongYea on youtube and look at what all the people that preordered F76 for over $300 for the collection edition have been putting up with since beta.

I'd love to see a platform breakdown.
---
There are 3800 on this sub ATM.  Yeah, I figure plenty of players are on the game.
---
Lol never go into a camp like this 99% of the time it's a trap camp
---
One of everyone's first chores with a new character should be gathering an auto rifle of some kind and a hazmat suit to be able to jump into every SBQ event. Never stim, just shoot everything and land as many shots as possible on SBQ. It's so much fun. What's the worse that can happen, you die and respawn?
---
But that doesn't affrect their *game*. Which is what I said originally, I even go on to say if it bothers them personally, its their own fault. They're choosing to react and feel that way if they get upset.
---
No you‚Äôre not shadow banned. Probably some more people will read this when the American timezone wakes up. For me, I have no answer or checked this out in-game.
---
Also, your title is a bit confusing, what about those 8 hours? Anyway title should be just the gist, in the description you can add more detail.

Dang you went in-depth. I just made mine a heavy-weapons obsessed maniac named after a demon. Also have a friend who role plays as a freaking communist soldier that went undercover and survived the bombs
---
Yeah that happened to me too!
---
Its there on Ps4 and Xbox but it's locked out and unusable in both adventure at an armor bench and taggable as Nuclear Winter apparel.
---
I will not support that click bait over reactor lol. 
---
My question is simple. Were we ever promised this hat you are complaining about? Can you show me where? I would love to see. 
---
Did yongyea tell you to be outraged and that is why you are posting?

You double-posted this.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(video_games)

It‚Äôs almost as if different words can have different meanings in different contexts. Grinding has been around in games for decades and it is often fun and, in some games, is the main enjoyment of the game. So, now that that‚Äôs settled, let‚Äôs just focus on what this thread is actually about? :)
---
Mind posting your build? 
---
I'm currently 100% invested in sneak rifleman but I recently rolled a two shot gatling plasma that I think could do a number on the SBQ with the right perks equipped. Plus I want my power fist to be able to take down mid-level scorched and ghouls in less than 3 punches...
---
That's a really bad coppout sheeple view.. Do some research.
---
eq2 is still going, but it's a Fremium type of game run by a russian company that sony sold it off to.
---
I have a suspicion the game weighs you more heavily towards players you've already interacted with. Purely anecdotal evidence, but I keep seeing the same people I buy from with other names changing fairly frequently.
---
Research on what? Were we promised a hat? If not... why are you complaining? Show me where we were promised the hat
---
Negative ghostrider, they are staying right there under the world where someone can't lag out getting to them and break into my stash.
---
And excuss me for actually making someone play the game and explore my camp. To be honest, caps don't really matter to me, it's mostly providing quality weapons and goods to players, so I could careless if someone wants to boycott my camp over some ignorant misconcieved notion that underground camps are the reason for reduced build limits.
---
What if they never release 5, 6 or 7 and this is the only thing we‚Äôre left with. Sometimes I think these thoughts and want to die.
---

If you want to try a good trap you can add me haha. 100% no punji boards
---
Were we promised a hat or not? Lol
---
What others say about not hoarding is definitely true. Be prepared to let go of your weapons in your stash--if you outgrow them you'll probably get something better soon. And if you find a weapon that you want to save until you're high enough level to use it, well, you will probably find several more like that before you get to that level (unless it's a good legendary weapon... those are worth saving if you think you'll use them). Speaking of legendary weapons... be ruthless about selling less useful ones for scrip at train station legendary exchanges. In a few hours I'll get 3-5 legendary items to sell, and they just take up space. 
---
Scrap as many weapons as possible to learn the mods and get the scrap. 
---
Outside of that, I can't emphasize enough, think ahead about what kind of build you want because redistributing your SPECIAL perks costs valuable points. Sniper/melee/heavy guns/commando/rifleman etc. FWIW i'm a rifleman but kind of wish I had invested in melee (OP) or heavy guns (fun).
---
While potentially an interesting and new feature. Honestly that all sounds like far too much work for Bethesda to even consider. Maybe in a sequel perhaps but you have to remember that they never really cared too much for fallout 76 when it was New, and it has been around for quite some time now. And if you could upload your own paint schemes for anything, you're probably going to have this stop people from even considering something from the Atom Store. Which won't go down well with the big cheeses at Bethesda either.
---
are you joining your friends when playing? maybe they join their friends too, and their friends join their other friends as well, and those join their friends and so on?
---
Huh. Interesting.  I found that when wearing my backpack with food/drink or chem mod, it forces me to 76. But wearing a high capacity backpack, never a fast travel issue
---
That's awesome I always just thought Aries was metal as hell so I was fine with doing the run with him.
---
Separate issue.
---
Yes im 99% sure it was datamined with the outfit. Bethesdas promises are whole other debate all together i don't feel like getting into with you until you become more informed.
---
I know right? I only noticed that last night. Ah well, better that than Daguerre‚Äôs PTSD monologues.
---
The wiki has advice on farming the strangler blooms once you have the recipe since they only really grow in one place.
---
Exactly! I'd also like to more tightly control where the explosion goes, to see if there is any impact of the explosion splashing to hit other objects. You've got me thinking about testing this more methodically now.
---
10K players on steam alone right now and I imagine consoles are more. 
---
So yea, hundreds of thousands of players overall. (Not on at the same time obviously).
---
But i see that's unrelated to the health regen issue. My issue is mostly just after dying. Still,  I'll tell my brother.  He bitches all the time about not being able to fast travel.  We both use the mutation
---
Did the camp owner just decide to leave the world when you entering his underground camp?
---
Yeah, that happened to me once. Lesson learnt - I will not waste my time entering any underground camp from that point.
---
It‚Äôs from the main questline.
---
My Level 9 mule sell guns next to The Pick. Good stuff and stuff just for scripping.
---
That isn‚Äôt what I asked. I didn‚Äôt ask if the game files exist. I asked if we were promised a hat? They gave us a photo of what the outfit was. No hat in the photo.
---
While the post is indeed about a bugged weapon(which in my opinion should be fixed ASAP) I can assure you that a bloodied  non-bugged weapon can kill the queen in 20 seconds easily. I have a video of me killing her in 45 sec with just 1* B handmade. There are people who can do this much better..
---
Ultracite armor plans are the cruelest rewards.
---
Let me throw a wrench in everything now. 
---
A furious gauss minigun. The explosive element is a part of the weapon system and not reliant on a legendary effect. What, if anything, changes?
---
 Yeah kinda hit me after I typed it
---
Ano this is waaay aye but there in the store now 250 atoms 2 days left
---
Ive never seen a Tesla used that way before so maybe some kind of fuckery. For that matter I didnt know we could have yellow skin either. Flamers do kinda work btw but apparently you need to bash the thing you want to heal with it rather than flame them. So pointless. If you are a melee player then a Shishkebab works just fine.
---
im already done the first season. bethesda, you gotta bring your a game for next season.  im level 6000 player and i need at least 900 dollar value for the game i purchased on sale and bashed on the internet üòé

Power armor and demolition expert might help buy increasing the accuracy and bumping the damage. Might show the variances better.

i usually put them halfway sticking out of the ground near the entrance

Glad to see my F U camp budget chart is still around! Lol. I can't believe rumors are around still around about the size of budget vs your level though.
---
Yeah, but look how they "fixed" the building issues... By limiting all.
---
i believe in you hunny
---
some public events are more profitable than others. just pop in on every queen nuke and you'll be swimming in treasury notes
---
Yea I'm not sure what the issue there is, I run into it with unyielding armor, or maybe it's one of the weight reduction perks on said armor. I haven't looked into it enough but it's very annoying having to go to v76. 
---
Next time it happens I'll have to check if I have an aid weight reduction perk on that armor. 
---
This game is held together with old gum and popsicle sticks.

Yeah I read that about the bashing. Seriously, how amateurish can they be? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And yeah I know I could just use the shishkebab, but it was the full-auto chaining that made it so appealing. They just ran around the most crowded areas and let loose!

I have those other 2 perks as well and am bot bloodied,too boring.

I like to think that this post is about me, I just started playing. I'm running a melee build and I teleported up to one of the blast zones with my friend just to watch it, and once the Scorchbeast landed I said fuck it and went in to try and contribute something lol. I remember also wearing the party hat at that time because who doesn't want to wear a party hat? In game name is DogeMachine if you remember the name
---
Are you aware of how many times Bethesda have switched out their marketing photos to cover their ass? Because they have sold something that wasn't as it appeared in their marketing? Look it up dude. The Freestates bundle is a good example of many. It's a pattern of behaviour now. Bad business 101. Im surprised for someone so knowledgeable that thinks they are right like you has missed it all.
---
Yeah me too, what annoys me some of the coolest paints are reserved for weapons i‚Äôll never use

put down a foundation, place a floormat on it, place a high chair or bass on the floormat, build stairs upwards from foundation, pick up the floormat with chair on it and place it on the stairs, move the stairs so they go downward from foundation into the ground, use chair to get below.

There's an auto axe that was cut from wastelanders, maybe they'll add that in
---
hey.  what level are u? r u on ps4? i have a level 35 instigating explosive lever action
---
We have a discord group that does all that and more if you'd like to check us out, We are the Enclave https://discord.gg/6v2utJw just give a hello when you stop by!
---
The problem is damage and server lag. As others have said you need to hit the damage threshold. However it seems it's not so straightforward. I had a no loot event yesterday despite hitting the queen in face for 1200 a couple of times between normal hits, which should have been enough. It occurred to me the issue is what is happening on my screen and what the server thinks is happening are two different things. I think the lag is responsible for a lot of weird damage behaviour, like rubberbanding, at the best if times but scorched earth is always exceptionally laggy.
---
Can't say I had that problem. Are you 100% sure you bought the chest and not just a mod for it?
---
Also, this perk increases damage if you have legendary weapons with an explosive prefix :)

---
Why are you deflecting? We are talking about a hat that wasn‚Äôt even promised to us. If you want to complain about other stuff start a new thread. I am specifically responding to complaints about not getting a free item that was never promised to us in the first place.
---
Yeah its all bit stupid considering the perk card has the vaultboy torching an ally with a flamer, not bludgeoning them with it. Its not meant to work the way it does. Something has screwed up somewhere (shocking right?). Who knows if it will ever be fixed.
---
As for the Tesla hopefully someone can answer that for you. Its news to me
---
"performing repetitive tasks"
---
repetitive is not a good word though. 
---
For me if it's fun it's called farming or you know, if it's not boring and repetitive but not quite fun.. it's not grinding.
---
Yes as I have no bullion left and the ultra lite limb mods should be there.
---
Well yeah.. You are personally attacking me and bulling me repeating the same question to try and get your view across which is alot more complicated than what you are making it, and i feel you have made it more about you than the principles of the issue i raised. Im trying to stand for something.. What are you doing?
---
How much did the chest piece cost on it's own?
---
Thanks for all the comments. With your help pvp will be saved!
---
Well yeah. It's great. It's just a grind to get enough crystal to make ammo and the damn thing breaks so fast you really need two lol
---
Where have I personally attacked you? I did attack yongyea. Is that you?
---
That was yesterday and I'm 70. I think it was 750 but don't remember for sure.
---
The queen has died in about 30 seconds the last couple times I've fought her anyway
---
I am as lib as they come but you can gtfo with this.
---
I'm with you there. With a game where dealing with factions is a huge part, not having a built in system for players to make their own groups seems like a big missed opportunity. Especially since the in game factions seem to keep you at arms length. For an online multiplayer game it still seems to have a lone wanderer vibe. 
---
If they let players form raider tribes that could declare war on each other, while pve players formed nonpvp factions just doing their own things, it could make a lot of people happy.
---
I raise you mounted creature heads... stacks and stacks of mounted creature heads
---
At this point i would like to be able to shop without fast traveling

Yo I can read this in OxHorns voice üòÇ
---
They took away the end game raids like 3 months ago
---
Is that how you think all this works is it? Maybe that's the problem here.
---
Yeah, probably an atom shop skin
---
We've had most of an entire server in the Whitespring for a Flatwoods Farmers Market meet up.
---
It went smooth. All in the same room (the upstairs bar)
---
An AH is all I want. I'm not super high level (only a bit over 100) but the reason I don't play as much anymore is I can't  find the weapon I need for my build. 
---
Due to needing 30 levels just to respect skill points + additional levels to complete your perk cards means you need to pick a build early. At level 32 shortly after the game launched I decided to join the Bloodied build gang as it seemed good for solo players.
---
For the next 80 or so levels I have only come across 3 bloodied weapons: a pipe pistol, crossbow, and western revolver. I can't afford for waste 45-50 levels to respec so I've been running the Bloodied western revolver build.
---
Having only 6 shots is mighty annoying. JUST GIVE ME AN AUCTION HOUSE  to get a bloodied weapon people actually use!
---
Or better yet, reduce the cost/time it takes to respec so I can change my build based on the best weapon I have at the time.
---
Maybe it was somehow using the medic legendary effect
---
Yeah, I am positively *swimming* in repair kits cause I've killed the SBQ so many times but the challenge "kill different kinds of tough enemies" never registers that I have.
---
If I can loot the SBQ then it should count. What do you expect me to do, solo her?
---
In hindsight, I'd have sacrificed some concision to write "him or her" throughout, or I'd have recast the sentences to have plural hypothetical subjects, for which the plural pronoun "them" would be appropriate. The single, hypothetical subject could also have been referred to generically as "her" instead of as "him" just as properly. If instead of a non-hypothetical and generic subject, I were instead dealing with a specific person who preferred (for whatever reasons) different pronouns, I'd happily have accommodated that. But I assure you, girlminuslife, that I am aware that many players are not dudes, and I've fully internalized that, and you're mistaken in imputing to me some sort of bias or blindness when I'm being [grammatically correct.](https://www.englishgrammar101.com/module-2/pronouns/lesson-9/pronoun-agreement) Thanks for reminding me how quickly some people assume the worst; that said, I'd rather stay somewhere closer to on topic.
---
That‚Äôs how the hat ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù works. If we were promised a hat and didn‚Äôt get it. You have a right to complain. If we weren‚Äôt promised a hat and never got the hat we were never promised your complaints are specious.
---
Here is the build [link](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fa435e5&amp;d=ei2ep0l71lm2p10pg0ph0pi0ib2ik0ii0c52p00pq1pp2a42an2ao0a30a00au2at1sq0s30sr0sw2ss2se2s50si0sj0) and a [picture](https://i.imgur.com/YChm2EP.png) in case nukesdragons is unavailable.

For your power fist you can probably get away with using just 3 perks, either gladiator "|expert|master or incisor 3, especially if you sneak and aims for the head.

Moss Town is right next to a fissure. Some noob spawns in and immediately gets wrecked... Plus the enemies in moss Town are a bit rough for low levels
---
I tried at both places there is no prompt to milk them
---
And when I do milk Brahmin the counter stays at 3/10 
---
milked
---
Nope. Random servers.
---
FFR = firing rate?
---
I guess that‚Äôs true, maybe I should stick to going for 2*
---
They could instance the locked rooms upstairs, enter into a trading hub
---
It‚Äôs a pretty common thing, when my wife and I first started someone came by and dropped off all kinds of plans and shit. You‚Äôll find yourself with a lot of crap you can do nothing with and then think, ‚Äúhey, let‚Äôs go give it to newbies‚Äù
---
1250 for the chest, but everything you bought definitely adds up so I'm not quite sure what's happened with the chest piece.
---
Have u tried contacting Bethesda support? Hopefully they can resolve your issue
---
THANK YOU! That was exactly the issue. That is a BIZARRE requirement for Scripping an item. There's zero communication in the interface that that's what's preventing the Scripping. That's maddening. Ugh. x\_x
---
I‚Äôm like that on PS4. I help me out and then they grow there level to become like me to help other out. I don‚Äôt like it when the newbies are toxic.
---
Wut
---
Man I wish people helped me out, no one wants to help me :(
---
Help me out here. As a guy who hasn't observed this, and would hopefully not perpetrate exclusionary behavior, how does this present itself, beyond the example here?
---
Lots of radshield is I think the only way to do that with out power armor or a radsuit. You will need to take lots of it, and still need a lot of radaway.
---
I really enjoy the personability of visiting vendors.   The auction house might not have the desired effect on the community. 
---
For example, if they removed the cap limit and introduce the auction house it‚Äôs most likely that:
---
Player interactions will go down as they won‚Äôt need to spawn into the world
---
People will not spend because they don‚Äôt have to
---
Prices will plummet
---
The system right now has a good balance of encouraging interaction, spending, pricing, and personality.
---
1000 RR - for regular armor.
---
The outfit is not associated with the NCR it is Pre-war riot gear that was used in the Charleston Police Department it has those letters printed on it.  (Sorry just dropping some lore)
---
This, coupled with a raid system and genuinely difficult end-game content would seriously turn the game around.
---
I'll agree in part but respectfully disagree with your stance on a whole. I know there is more too it than just that, but agree this isn't the black and white example to prove it.
---
I like to put outfits in the overseers crate... Something a new player might delight in finding like a bos officer suit with plus 2 strength or a golf outfit lol. Anything different from the vault suit. Also I always build a low level but powerful gun for them. And I leave ammo and such. Food, stims etc
---
As someone said already, it is indeed very common. Only thing we expect is those helped keep paying it forward. This way, we stay the friendliest community in-game.
---
My stance this entire time is limited to the hat. 
---
Besides my comments about the globe and topiary where your premise was factually incorrect. Facts matter.
---
With a full set of buttressed SS armor I have 297 RR.
---
Add Radshield for another +300 RR for a total of 597RR and I was still taking 16-18 rads a second. 
---
So to get to 1 a sec without power armor it seems you would need somewhere in the multiple thousands.
---
I knew there was a use for the shiskabob
---
Keep playing, you‚Äôll find someone eventually
---
How do you know how much damage you are doing when you are on a group? Do it solo and see what the damage difference is. Whatever the damage you are doing with full health build, low health build does 3 times that. Keep that in mind. Doesn't matter if you are able to kill SBQ in 3 seconds with junkies build. Bloodied would be able to kill her in 1 second with same settings
---
No dude you don't have the facts. You are just going on what Bethesda have sold you.
---
Hhmm I have a legacy explosive tesla. How can I test this out?
---
Sweet! I like your style. I have one character right now. AA rifleman. I don‚Äôt RP with him, he‚Äôs my do everything, grind like a mad man character. But I gotta say, after getting the SS armor completed I am DONE with the grind holy hell I am so tired of it. So I‚Äôm making a new character probably today that I‚Äôm gonna RP with, no grind, non legendary prefix build, probably won‚Äôt even do wastelanders quest line. Just gonna roam around, build a fitting camp and have fun just being a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù guy in the wastes. Not sure what I‚Äôm gonna RP, but I‚Äôm thinking plumber(only pipe weapons and a pipe wrench) wearing a cool jumpsuit. Or I‚Äôm thinking maybe a no camp traveling bow hunter who loves hunting cryptids. Haven‚Äôt really thought up much backstory but I‚Äôll just piece that together as I play the character.
---
I was probably about level 20-something and was following a questline in the Glassed Caverns. I'm not good in combat so my character is a sneaky sniper/archer.  So there I am fully kitted out in my Chinese Stealth Armour, overencumbered as usual, when the nuclear strike warning goes out.  I decide to try to get out as I wasn't sure if I would get annihilated in the Caverns.  I found the lift which took me back above ground just outside the blast zone - and found myself in the middle of the Scorchbeast Queen battle.
---
So here's all these really high level players in full power armour and I thought I might as well join in.  So I'm sneaking around and taking pot shots at the Queen when I can, and finally they brought her down.  Was so happy getting the few items for the quest although I hadn't done much - but the best thing was all the other players who came up to me afterwards and dropped me some legendary items  - they must've wondered what the hell I was doing there!
---
Long story short, it did take me a long time to walk home with all my goodies, buy it was well worth it
---
I agree - just suggesting a way to avoid a frustrating encounter
---
Never heard of that. But I bought them all one at a time and could see them with no issues. I did frequently forget to read them and get to the bench only to have to go back out and read the plan.
---
You do need legendary modules. Maybe you are filtering for what you can make and you don't have all the materials?
---
My second char lives on and in seneca rocks. I gotta say, sometimes ppl spawn in my bunker inside the mountain instead of on top of the camp like intended. Everyone living up there knows the spawn point hassle. But i always keep my vendors up there.
---
Wonder then why they did not do the obvious and make it a player vending hub?
---
I saw a build like this at the Whitespring train station. The neck of the bass was the only thing sticking out above the ground. It was pretty cool gotta say
---
Pioneer scouts?
---
I scrapped mine and a forest scout mask too, i wish all event rewards are non-scrappable like the Fasnachet masks.
---
I'd go back to the vendor and make sure you bought all the right plans. If you did, they won't show up as available. If they do, you might have accidentally bought something else.
---
How do you figure? How does building under the map affect the server?
---
Thanks, that's very nice of you to let me know I'm visible, I have got it to work but it is unreliable.
---
hopefully at least until SKATE4 comes out..
---
Did you buy the jet pack armor? Because that isn't actually the armor. That is a mod.
---
Friendly Fire perk, another person to test it on, fall damage to lower their health, Pacifist mode ON to make sure you don't trigger PVP instead, and fire away!
---
If there are no specific flaming capacitors, then i doubt the full-auto mod would matter much. But it did appear to be a full-auto that they were using.
---
Thanks for your help! It's super late here though so I'm going to sleep now.
---
Doubt it, if this idea is ever implemented every high level player will hang out there, no scorchbeasts will live long enough to get a sonic attack off. Besides, why would a trading hub that would be primarily used by end game players be open to lower levels  who would have nothing to offer and no caps to spend. It would **have** to be locked behind an end game quest to prevent or at least make it  difficult for bots to access the area and control the economy with real currency.
---
You learn how to make it during the Free States quests when you're finding Ella Ame's Research, I think the quest is Organic Solutions.
---
I am a water farmer, like literally farming, not just hunting multiple monsters of the same kind and Calling it farming.I have a water farm and run 5-6 purifiers, wich i then take the water and either sell it at railroad stations, or give away.  As well as a decent amount of crops growing, and fresh milk from my brahmin, all at my heavily polluted waterfront property. I have vending machines, but I dont make alot off them, water's where it's at, everyone needs water. Currently messing with brews and ales as I look for plans for bar fixtures.
---
Keep at it you'll come across people that will. I know I randomly drop stuff for beginner levels. I just dont have all the stuff that much higher levels have to be able to drop. So I drop Aid, and whatever plans and weapons I have available for those levels or close to those levels
---
Revive ?
---
I can hop on and off real quick if you‚Äôre still looking.
---
Loot on the queen.
---
Havent tested this myself but supposedly strangler blooms can be harvested by dyer chemical when heart of the swamp is active.
---
Its a random reward in the forest region. Any event there might spawn it.
---
as long as there is somewhere safe to FT to IDGAF...
---
No, pests control
---
We won‚Äôt be getting another Fallout for a loooong time. As mentioned, they have those two big games to release first. No new fallouts for a long time is kinda depressing...
---
Friendly fire only works on teammates not random nearby players.  There is no fire option for the tesla rifle and if they had a legacy version it would still be energy damage not fire as explosive damage isn't fire damage. 
---
My guess is they had a medic's tesla and you were on their team otherwise they have a glitched gun.
---
I do Athlete, Mamologist and Archer.. seems easier than killing multiple yao
---
Hunter would be my 5th choice after Swimming...
---
Yeah that is the only thing that makes sense plus OP has to be on Marge's team for any of these perks to work
---
Have plenty of legendary modules. Built 11 ss left legs looking for a 3\* uny. Have contacted Beth in the past when after a crash, 3\* weaps were gone. They were no help. I have 4 3\* uny urban scout armor and 1 chameleon so I'll just go back to the grind.
---
Yeah just keep doing his daily quest and eventually he will give you the recipe. It‚Äôs pretty random the order of how you get the recipes. On one character I got ballistic bock right away, bout on another it took two weeks of doing the quest to get ballistic bock. 
---
Getting the recipe is the easy part. Finding consistent ant meat is the tricky thing
---
well for starters i'd clear up the strength skills. strong backs pretty much garbage, 1 point for 10 carry weight is laughable compared to weight reduction perks (eg traveling pharmacy rank 3 drops a stimpak from weighing 1 to 0.1) after that id remove the heavy guns/melee cards and focus on shotgun perks and investing in blocker isnt a bad thing to have either since you'll be at close range.
---
for perception id just swap out green thumb for 1 rank of concentrated fire. shotguns in vats can be stupidly broken at times so targeting the face will boost damage quite a bit.
---
in endurance id personally drop down to 3 to use the points elsewhere and equip rank 3 fireproof to reduce explosion damage from enemies
---
charisma max out lone wander and add suppressor since your in striking range
---
intelligence drop Special again and lose batteries included since you aren't using enegy weapons or bothering to carry fusion cores
---
agility drop gun fu as VATS is easily stopped and lose the damage buff, so focus on enforcer, action boy/girl and adrenaline 
---
and with luck only use super duper when crafting and no need for with salt things last long enough or you can just get some more without worrying, so swap those for grim reaper sprint to reset the AP on vats kills and bloody mess for more damage
---
here's a link to a rework that'd be good for ya [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f43679c&amp;d=c72cr0ic4lu2l71pc2i12as2a72sb2su2sp1sd1sg2so1p00eh2cm0l12lh0lt2a02&amp;m=29cfie&amp;am=192a3b-152431-1526-102634-192a31&amp;wp=w7w7w7w7w5w3&amp;wm=1l20-152832-172534-1i2737-112438-112934) 
---
from here you could also drop first aid for more adrenaline or thru hiker to carry more food
---
Well said
---
They are not why we have reduced build limits but I would not be surprised if these bases messed with server stability somehow.
---
As I understand it, Bethesda never fixed the underlying "Stay On This World" glitch associated with incorrectly stocked vending machines.
---
Dude, this ain't it.
---
You can knock its health down to a sliver with any other weapon and then bash it with a syringer.
---
It forces them to render stuff in a space that wasn't intended to have anything in it.
---
Take over the ammo factory n he will come. Hang out by White Spring Train Station and he will walk by. These areplaces I see him a lot.
---
You're a moron
---
I maxed out two characters at the time.  
---
An elf Hunter and a Death Knight. When I found you could send things via an in-game mail system I would consider a new character and give it a small boost with some gold and items that another char couldn't/wouldn't use.  
---
BGS won't add that in as 76 is a big time sink. Time is something you can't get back.
---
Technically you're right saying that the fire rate is not what triggers this bug. The issue is that this bug only has a meaningful effect (like melting the SBQ in seconds) when you use a very high fire rate weapon (around 160-200). Also server latency has some impact so with high FR the effect will be more visible/useful. So in practice you do need high FR to knock off huge chunks of enemie's health bar super fast. At least this is what I've experienced.
---
Don't worry, I love you too
---
That's cuz u need more anti armour mobdz
---
Just put a wandering vendor locator in the personal terminal.
---
The rifle class has gotten the fixer the only "4 star" weapon in the game
---
I like protecting my camp from passing baddies, and I don‚Äôt need your caps; plenty of other people like my wares. 
---
But honestly... you having to get out of your PA to enter my camp does suck. And I wish you didn‚Äôt have to. (But I also ask why the hell you run around in PA all the time...? I mean, I use mine maybe once a week, or so...?)
---
I'm a female gamer, I'd rather not have people worry about changing the way they speak or play on my behalf. This is a place where everyone is treated equally by default because no one knows who your are or what you look like. 
---
I don't care what pronouns people choose to use, but using they/their is improper English, and uncomfortable for most people to use. I would rather be treated equally than have people stressing to use the right words to avoid offending me.
---
An awesome possum!

Just nuke the site really well so you have to wear pa to fight
---
I can tell you I definitely wasn't on their team. After we took down SBQ and some scorched Stingwings and Ants attacked, and *after* they were all dead this person healed the damage I was taking from the poison effect that was still on me. So I don't think it was Medic's either, cos it was a small but continuous amount - not enough to negate the healing but just enough to stop it from killing me (Bloodied build).
---
In light of what you're saying I guess it can only be a glitched gun of some sort üòî
---
That bloodied gauss you rolled is a magic variant. If you put the tri-barrel on it, it will decimate the SBQ quickly. You have to be fairly close to her, but it will shred her hp. Along with any other enemy. Its currently a great roll to have.
---
both pioneer scout quests (the toxic waste and bug collection) and there's the unmarked drop off of mirelurk meat at ohio river adventures for raider rep
---
If you go back to Regs it shows what you bought as "known". Just double check that. I think you maybe accidentally clicked a different plan.
---
Same thing happens to me with ultracite plasma cores. It's weird but I won't argue with getting more of them for less cost!
---
Gorillas are apes, not monkeys.
---
What platform?
---
theoretically for hundreds of years? theoretically speaking of course.
---
realistically? as long as it turns a profit and has active players. It'll have support for years to come.
---
PS4
---
Honestly, the player terminal that already exists in game would be perfect for buying and selling. A Player sets up a vendor as they do now, but instead of having to visit the player's vendor other players could log on to the terminal to see who has vendors available and then browse them to purchase things. Though in my thought on this the player vendor would still be available for in person shopping, and that may (more than likely would) lead to some sort of unintentional duping of items (Player A is purchasing something at the vendor at the same time Player B is purchasing the same item. I'm guessing lag issues and how often the game updated would play a part too). 
---
I like your idea, but I'd hope that they wouldn't get rid of the player vendors entirely, I rather enjoy visiting other people's CAMPS and seeing how they've designed and build them. Some players are simply ingenious when it comes to constructing their CAMPS, I went to one a few weeks ago that still has me in awe at the time and planning that must have gone into it's construction.
---
&gt; the 5 of people paying for atoms
---
But there is FO1st tents everywhere.
---
You can use your personal terminal to start them.
---
its maddening when you first encounter it, but once you know how it works it becomes a great feature preventing you from scrapping the gear you want to keep
---
I understand, stop playing my OP tank build. Spend more with others. Gunslinger, heavy weapons and demolition builds. Each brings a different variety of playstyle. I just like unyielding armors for buffs in special attributes. Easier for speech checks, prices and carry weight. Love the freedom of no power armor. I like to not worry about maintenance and change outfits daily.
---
I don't think this is possible then.  Your teammates might have used stimpak diffusers or the team medic perk as both would restore a small amount of health to you.
---
As far as I am aware there aren't any glitched healing weapons on consoles.
---
Might be an exploit where people can access your stash through an empty vending machine. Seems to be several active bugs with the vending machines still.
---
I think there are matchmaking pools, maybe based on region or whatever. maybe it weighs putting you in lobbies with the same players. Happens to me too but theres plenty of players, its not a conspiracy
---
It‚Äôs RNG from BIV. It took me **eight months** before he dropped the Nuka Cola Dark recipe for me. 
---
My wife got it on her third BIV visit...
---
Or you could see the name of the player who built the CAMP and then find them on the map. In my experience players generally stay close to home or their at one of the quest locations and are easy to find.
---
The ss jetpack is super overrated imo. I bought it after I collected all the other stuff I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and its not really that useful or great. Unless you consider rapidly draining your AP useful or great.  
---
There are consumables you can use to give brief periods of "unlimited AP," but I have no interest in farming them for a few brief seconds of flight
---
I'd rate it a 1 out of 5.
---
We also have 10 weeks to complete it, so plenty of time to take time and enjoy. I think and if not hope there is a gamboard display and it shows where we are located within it. THEN, if we can post it on our camp wall, would be awesome. This may cause more competitiveness, tho. Lol üòÜ
---
&gt; I've been in no other game where this is a thing.
---
I have. It's in the GTA games as well. Although in those games it's usually a stuck car horn noise.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs not a bad idea... But we need better customization or there‚Äôs going to be a *lot* of repeats.
---
&gt;Seriously, except for the SBQ
---
And there is your problem right there. I imagine a similar case with ISS &amp; WC?
---
I wasn't on a team at all cos I don't want to lose my Lone Wanderer perk, and it was only when I was being zapped by their Tesla Rifle. They were moving around between everyone pretty quickly, hipfiring I assume, and when I wasn't being zapped I wasn't being healed. No idea
---
I was lucky one time these 2 Yao Guais attacked one of the unkillable guards at Raiders stronghold. Sat back and needed to shoot a ton of syringes even after dwidling down their health to a smidgeon.
---
At first the nukes would cause a lot of strain on the servers so we‚Äôd nuke in your location ‚ÄòA‚Äô to have most of the blast purposely be out of the map. Many players (myself included) stuck with this habit. Personally I prefer this location as well since it‚Äôs more flat, but I don‚Äôt mind fighting at the survey location either.
---
No idea then as friendly fire only works on teammates.  I run it constantly and forget that from time to time at events.
---
Fair enough I didn't know that before you mentioned, cos I assumed it worked on players/NPCs alike.
---
Ah yes rereleasing this 1500 power armor recommit will totally fix the glitch where you don‚Äôt get rewarded reputation making our already flawed grind worse
---
Cheers, I'll have a look.
---
I saw a 1111 just hanging out at prime.
---
This but unironically
---
Also on console you get region locked servers I don't know if it happens on pc your region might have a smaller player group then say the western us servers or the UK servers
---
He even helps with the enemy spawns at the factory
---
I think variant b is better because many times I have died and respawned within the nuke zone, and nearly die again from rads before I can get my PA out.
---
You don‚Äôt get another one you have to pay for another one
---
I don't know who told you that but as far as i know that is incorrect
---
I'll bring sweetrolls to thank him with.
---
But on ps4 there is only FO76,no crappy Bethesda client. What I think is going on with his game is either the patch didnt install correctly or maybe he should try the "rebuild database" within the ps4.
---
Never had this problem on ps4 so it's pretty strange.
---
Spoiler: the final boss is Todd Howards hair and the only way to beat it is to buy a subscription to a Bethesda branded hairspray service. Oh and the rights to your everlasting soul is part of the TOS.
---
Variant A has vastly increased chances of the SBQ landing and keeping the fight outside of the cloud.
---
The area in B is filled with gullies so the SBQ is much less likely to land making it almost impossible for melee players to participate.  
---
Finally there are so few enemies in these areas that nuking WS or Morgantown are vastly better if you want stabilizers.
---
And this happens ...how often exactly?
---
Thank you, my friend told me that but he‚Äôs also kind of a dick so he was probably messing with me üòÇ
---
Oh they changed it again? After they brought back vendors, I was unable to leave the server while the vending machines were in use
---
This game isn‚Äôt popular enough for that
---
Vault 76, I want to go back home.
---
Wait.  We're supposed to make the dross sit IN the tire?  OMG, I have been doing this wrong since launch.  I thought you were just supposed to get it to go through the opening.
---
How many caps did you get?
---
Factions only make sense when pvp works
---
Holy crap this would creep me out.
---
It's probably one of those random encounters Wastelanders brought with it.
---
One time I stalked some ghouls in the woods...got them all. Then I went quietly away and there was this creepy little girl that wanted to go home but couldnt find the way or some shit. Very creepy. She disappeared as soon as I turned my back to her basically.
---
I might be wrong, but it *could* be location based. When I lived in Hawaii, I kept seeing the same people all the time. When I moved to Texas, I saw completely new people. Might also have to do with time zones.
---
When its verdant season at night they are active
---
Its from a side quest.
---
I do this a lot on my high level character, I get a shit ton of plans for things I already know and those suckers have weight so I make regular dumps of all plans and ammo in the suitcases littering the various train stations I couldn't begin to tell you how many .38 rounds, mini Nukes and Missiles I've left around the map.
---
And no, that wasn't me either lol
---
Either messing with you or just misinformed.  First one is on the house but that's in.  Have to buy every one after that.
---
i get the grove and alot of plants doing it below v9.
---
Hmm never noticed...
---
No it‚Äôs just been my personal challenge to get all dross to land in the tire, standard caps were given no extra bonus, though I feel like I should get a weapon of my choosing
---
V9 has flat battleground north, south, east and west. Delta has trenches all over the west. People only nuke Delta to put the Flooded Trainyard in the nuke zone.
---
Thanks for the input! Didn't think of that, but makes sense. Now that you mention it, I think I remember that it was possible to crash servers by launching nukes back in the day (not sure if any other circumstances needed to be met for that to happen).
---
Hahahahaha that is awesome glad you threw that out there
---
Coool thank you
---
Yes, that was true. Having some of the nuke out of bounds helped a lot.
---
What platform are you on? I have a 2shot vats damage perception handmade, a nocturnal explosive agility handmade and a ghoul slayers fixer with two other stats is part ways with for some caps
---
I'm on xbox
---
for weapons I roll 2* most of the time.. so Ill get more rolls to get something good for my build..
---
once I get some good 2* stuff for my build Ill roll 3*
---
I always roll 3* for armor..
---
For sure.  Actually glad it works that way because there is no chance I'll scrip my favorite gear accidentally.  Now if they would give the damn fixer an option for a skin that would be just fantastic!!
---
I think those engine bugs will simply never be fixed, they decided it's out of scope so they're going to support this game with content and microtransactions until it's not worth it anymore. 
---
It probably would cost them too much and they know they can't recycle the work like they can with engine work on Elder Scrolls 6 -&gt; Fallout 5. I want them to fix the broken weapons though, that is totally doable and just pure laziness.
---
Pretty sure only a hazmat suit will do that. But a hazmat suit is a death sentence for entirely another reason (ie: no armor).
---
I think you should still just spend your scrip on 3 stars, you can find a decent one or two star rifle in peoples vendors for good prices.
---
The comment you‚Äôve replied to doesn‚Äôt really contain many big words. If you‚Äôre having a hard time following it (which you might be, considering your Power Rangers comparison), you might consider putting your controller down for a short while to try to get some reading done.
---
Or how about spawning inside someone's foundation? I've had that happen to me on numerous occasions. Go to check out vendor, fast travel there spawn in inside a concrete foundation. Deploying PA doesn't work and FT back to the place spawns you in in the same predicament. Frustrating.
---
Waiting another decade and waiting till Fallout 5 are the same thing.
---
Yeah he's either messing with you or he's getting it confused with the assaultron circuit board.
---
Watched a video about it and it's the 2nd best 1H melee in the game behind the ski sword. It doesn't matter though if you don't like the actual weapon I guess.
---
Like others have already said I assume they just meant it as a metaphor for farming gold as that's the cliche for how people used to do it. Though in Appalachie the 'gold bullion' doesn't come from the river but is distributed by secret agents from their underground vault...which they couldn't really have shown in the trailer so they choose a figurative alternative to it.
---
The foundation free version of the dome will place on an open 2 x 2 upper floor layout. It won't quite cover the whole space, there are small gaps at each corner but those are easy to cover/hide with plants, etc. I never tried dropping one on a roof with the same opening though, I was trying to keep the build budget cost at a minimum.

üòç wouldn‚Äôt that be the most wonderful thing, I would aim for huge expansions, make all atom store items available in game, increase daily scrip levels, allow copious amounts for gold bullion to be turned into special legendary points to help towards those god roll items we all desire, have a big enough dev team to actually make all the original promise come to fruition
---
Change your preferred skin in the atom store before you play nw
---
They can't have such giant gaps between content drops.
---
Imo purveyor sales and double xp aren't events. I barely considered the treasure hunter event either.
---
They need more stuff to allow players to create their own fun. Look at Minecraft, they add a few new things each year and players use their imagination to keep the game fresh. We need more abstract stuff like that.
---
With legendary perks, I could see them implementing the same thing they did with ESO and the champion points. That would be cool. Basically, you start out as low level, like you normally would on a new character, but you would have all your legendary perks as well.
---
You just wrote everything that is wrong with F76 PvP
---
If the player happens to be at his or her camp, and unstealthed, then yes, it's trivially easy to tell the player's level.
---
If the player is unstealthed and elsewhere, you can mouse over all the dots you can see on the map, trying to find the dot which corresponds to the CAMP you're considering visiting. That's a pain, though.
---
And if the player is stealthed (and not teamed with you), then he or she does not show up on the map.
---
did they confirm that elder scrolls would be before fallout 5? I don't remember hearing that.
---
Kannst mich gerne adden. GT: FlowJo82
---
Right now I‚Äôm level six, and I play on PC.
---
Now that makes me curious, I'll keep that in mind thanks
---
I'm sorry I bring my turrets to SBQ. I'll let you all waste your ammo doing 1-2 damage per minute, that way the timer runs out and we don't get anything. Idiot downvoters...
---
Hadn't even considered it until you mentioned it.  Now I've list my will to play!!!
---
Spectrum sucks a big one at my house.We get a few random disconnects hourly.its not the game everything in the house goes offline for 15 seconds.sorry for ranting ...
---
Hostility meter reflecting players killed within the last 12 hours or 24 would be a nice indicator of trap houses
---
Follow the Overseer's questline until at least level 5 (I'd suggest level 10 personally) before you venture out exploring on your own. You'll get some decent level appropriate weapons and armor from completing those quests. Scrap any and all weapons and armor you won't be using in the near future (if you're level 10, there's no real need to hang on to those level 45 T51 PA pieces you had to remove from the PA frame).
---
Sees medicines in camp display, proceeds to go to the camp. They might have serums. But no they have 100 radaways. Nice! Try selling those to in game vendors next time champ! And you cant even blame the lower levels bc its not even their fault.
---
Hmm, time to go re-solo her then and see how I get on. The last time I did I wasn't running bloodied.
---
&gt;Variant A has vastly increased chances of the SBQ landing and keeping the fight outside of the cloud.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The  area in B is filled with gullies so the SBQ is much less likely to land  making it almost impossible for melee players to participate.
---
Variant B also has some wide and flat areas to the south-east, although I agree that they're much smaller than at variant A, so proper positioning is even more important. I didn't have any trouble keeping the fight outside the blast zone, though. That being said, most players don't know how to position correctly. Quite often I've had fights at Drop Site V9 where the SBQ almost never landed because of this. I've also had fights where the SBQ stayed in the air for the entire time. I would assume that since fights at Forward Station Delta are even rarer, even less players know where to stand because it's likely their first time there. In the few fights I had there, most players stayed very close to the blast zone, and it was hard dragging the SBQ out to flat areas in the south-east.
---
&gt;Finally there are so few enemies in these areas that nuking WS or Morgantown are vastly better if you want stabilizers. 
---
I see the flux and stabilizers at Scorched Earth more like a cherry on top - you kill the SBQ, then walk into the blast zone, clear it, then do something else. That being said, I also use lots of heavy guns, so i need violet and fluorescent flux, which is abundant in that area. As for the stabiliziers, mining the Ultracite at the smaller fissure site yields lots of them if enough players do it, as every time anyone interacts with those it spawns a handful of Scorched. For my current build, this is highly sustainable, although I can see that you would rather want to farm your flux and stabilizers elsewhere if you primarily needed yellowcake or cobalt flux.
---
Well for the queen I would switch some perks around obviously. It's not happening every 5 minutes though. What's a ISS? I didn't try the colossus yet, I haven't played in months.
---
:)
---
Same here. 
---
I roll 2* until I get something I half like to tide me over, then switch it up to 3*. I always go 3* on armor as well.
---
I was an ATOM Shop item, and I believe as of right now that particular bundle is no longer offered for sale, I bought it last year when it was first offered and I think it came out when they put Nukashine in the game as a part of Nuka Cola bundle. I'm not sure though, it's been forever.
---
why is that fair..?
---
how does the game know you didnt just quit without logging off?
---
Players would purposefully disconnect to get rewards. We should be able to re-connect to the same world and get loot from drops and such though. It very rarely allows you to join back on a friend and loot the SBQ if you crash.
---
Tbf I bought a 15k cap TSE flamer from one of these underground camps once. I was sweating bullets going in, checking out the machine, and GTFO of there as quick as I could.
---
i tried but it doesnt even give me an option to just inspect, purchase atoms and back
---
Thank you!
---
sometimes I roll 3*..  
---
usually only when Im getting backed up on scrip with a ton of gear still yet to scrip or during sales...
---
Pre-Wastelanders I'd see him and Chally on the road by the Pleasant Valley Train Station quite a bit, but ever since the Blood Eagles moved into the neighborhood he's MIA
---
There is a damage bug in game if you wear a piece of armor with blocking your shotguns are op in vats.im sure it hasn't been patched used it yesterday. I have no shotgun damage perks still running rifleman oddly
---
seems kinda self important to get assed about an off topic post getting removed...
---
also.. fukka BOS.. hopefully the game will protect far fewer of them than settlers and raiders so I can shoot them all in the face to death...
---
Godd Howard himself has coded fallout 76, and because of this, the code is beyond mortal understanding. They can't fix bugs that were made by a God. This is propably Godd's camp because this is simply how he sees us mortals.
---
Ok Karen
---
The difference is that one of them forces you to log off and the game recognizes it as a disconnect while the other one is manual and is recognized by the game as you manually logging off. The game even tells you if you get disconnected or if you are quitting.
---
They confirmed that Starfield is coming first, then TES VI, which is still a long way off. I do not recall anything in particular being said about Fallout 5 yet, so if the game is already in development, then it must be in secret, and likely by a different studio. Maybe it is, but I am more inclined to believe it will come only after Elder Scrolls 6.
---
I said without logging off..
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJMtA0EXVcY&amp;t=52s Here is my current underground shop.
---
I am now?
---
Should always try to balance the two as there is a curve of diminishing returns. I'm not sure what Fo76's is, but I do know that, my 50% armour pen. hunting rifle almost rivaled that of my non legendary gauss rifle (up until I obtained prime received for the gauss).
---
Both of them have superior AP mags. And I'm hoping to get prime receiver for my hunting rifle because it shoots faster and is much easier to use. 
---
I'm using 2x (or -26%) anti armour perks for the rifles.
---
That sucks, maybe after you can craft them it will show up.
---
A lot of it depends on the time of day you normally play. I work 3rd shift so I usually play after work in the early to mid morning (my time) and I see a lot of the same players, but on my nights off and I'm playing into the wee hours of the morning, I rarely see any of the usual "morning crew". So just a guess, if you're usually playing at the same time of day everyday then so are the other people.  Log in at a different time of day you'll more than likely see a whole new group of people.
---
I used have an underground camp and made it into a bunker/vault but i always kept my vendors behind a passcode so that only me and friends or club can get to my vendors.
---
Whitesprings vendors would probably be a good start if looking for C.A.M.P. plans. You can also find some in players vendors.
---
Nvm
---
Just visit ppl‚Äôs vendors.  Most plans are very cheap and there are tons for sale.
---
So I wouldn't get overweight every time I die and force to respawn at vault 76 if... I were nice to bethesda?
---
My point you say? While there are numerous bugs that should not exist in 2020, we have fucking blue skin in the atom shop. And more useless stuff next week. Because that's what important.
---
Solid agree.  I can't bring myself to shoot them.  If you sit there and watch them long enough they do some cute things.
---
Ditto man, I keep my vendor prices around 30% of fed76 price guidelines. I just like people to check out my camp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJMtA0EXVcY&amp;t=52s
---
You don‚Äôt want us to see it. But you post about it and give us the exact name of it. Interesting.
---
Out of curiousity, what does Radeon Settings say about the GPU utilization while Fallout 76 runs? I'm asking because I'm also an AMD user (R9 390X) and I've started to get really bad stuttering and low FPS a bit more than one week ago. Before that, the game ran okay-ish (worse than Fallout 4 and quite bad in some notorious places, but overall playable), but now it's just not fun to play most of the time. I've also lowered the settings, but that didn't help. And for some reason, the GPU utilization is always at 100%. I would've expected it to be lower and that the stuttering comes from the game idling for some reason, but I can't see how it can utilize GPU resources to its fullest while still having low FPS, when two weeks ago, it worked just fine for the most part...
---
I've also uninstalled my drivers, reset everything to factory settings, then removed all traces of the drivers using Display Driver Uninstaller and then installed the latest drivers again, but to no avail. You may try it for yourself as well, but I would assume it won't work for you either.
---
I've found several NPCs panning for gold just down river from the Tygart Water plant, they warned me away because that was their part of the river.
---
Isn‚Äôt this basically the mole miner babushka? Just give her the ability to sell named stuff for legendary script and boom.
---
Ok thanks!
---
I'm having the same issue as well currently. Getting really sick of spending caps to fast travel to her just to hear about her back. I'm thinking I might have to submit a ticket and have her questline restarted. My friend had no issue getting her.
---
Are you on xbox1? I'v been doing the event this morning trying to get the fixer plan. I have one more built keycard ready to go. Going to start it in 1 hour, so if you want to join just add me on xbox live: Antonyco50
---
Yeah, griefers are easily avoided by changing servers.  Glad your experience has been positive overall!
---
For camp plans, take control of workshops. You get one plan each time you take one. Leave and let it get overrun. Then kill of the invading baddies to retake it and get another plan.
---
Take over a workshop then server hop, repeat
---
Go for 3*. If u get a good roll, even if it's not the prefix you're looking for, you will have much higher chances of trading it for something you like. Also, as others have said, you can find decent 2* stuff by just roaming between people's vending machines.
---
I've been getting some camp plans by taking and defending workshops.
---
Really? I kinda thought they were pretty useless til now!
---
Good point!  The undersuits aren't levelled, are they?
---
Went for the consistently level 26 one at Phillipi battlefield graveyard. Did most of the damage with a suppressed lever action and finished it off with a bleeding barrel. Damn those things suck at reloading. Had to come out of vats a few times to get it to load. Still, finally got it yesterday.
---
If your leader is a pos and you still follow him, you deserve all the criticism
---
Technically it could be. But you would get that quest naturally by following the main quest.
---
Yes I have, my main is a level 74 sneaky and strong. It's not an issue with that, it's that Demolition perk cards are not available to choose.
---
Man. Sounds like I'm kind of an asshole for having a CAMP in the forest and selling screws for 7 caps each.
---
News to me, cool!
---
I think the main thing is they want to encourage people to go to others camps and having a hub would remove that need. But it would be cool if there was a link to maybe one of your vending machines at a marked up cost. That way you could still shop at the white spring but still encourage camp exploration.
---
And for generator plans, do the ‚ÄúPowering Up...‚Äù quests at power plants. You‚Äôll get one generator plan each time you do it.
---
Lol I teamed with this person the other day, they have a high level main and some tough as balls stuff, they were 1 shooting everything with a 2shot explosive when I teamed with
---
I went for hunter, archer and athlete. Easiest ones for me playing solo.
---
Hiya! My characters name is Berron Ender, she was the second-in-command of a stationary caravan re-supply just north of Point Pleasant. Business was business for years, until it wasn‚Äôt. The Cult of the Mothman began to build a stronger presence in the Appalachia, making travelers more weary to head deeper into the West of the wood. All the traders who once filled that Northbound road have all but moved on, heading East for a ‚Äúpromised city of vendors‚Äù. Most of those who stayed were either abducted by or inducted to the Mothman Cult if they were so lucky, the unfortunate few such as the caravan leader were eaten or worse by Deathclaw. Berron is the last remaining original member of the caravan, taking up the title of Ender. She now focuses on maintaining and reviving the once flourishing market, focusing on plans and survivability goods. Building is crucial for this character, so she spends most her time hunting for scraps. She utilizes light gorilla warfare, hit and run tactics to move through crowds, avoiding drawn out combat at all costs. She isn‚Äôt alone either, having found a friend in the wastelands who claims to have fallen from the stars and who has set up camp in the caravan. She lends a hand by restoring all the once operational technology the caravan possessed. 
---
Summary: Last remaining member of a past caravan society. Scrapper extraordinaire, light arms combat, social character looking to rebuild mass trade. 
---
‚Ä¢I play on the PS4, definitely looking for more peeps to play with. My account name is Hundredhands4u, I‚Äôm a 25M and I live out in the PNW of the US.
---
Feel like Vault 76 should be refitted to be a hub but yet again it would hard to do stuff around that especially for new players that start in 76, soo maybe a new vault if even possible?
---
For best use of your time, don‚Äôt defend. Just let it get taken over, then retake it. You just need to kill of one batch of enemies instead of defending against waves.
---
Do you have the right perks equipped?
---
Yeah, that is true. But the guy was standing there afk for like 15 minutes so I don't know
---
Nice. A plumber build sounds cool, the bowhunter is a a probably a real challenge. Throwing knifes, hatchet, bow / crossbow... Sounds hard! Maybe allow a pistol as sidearm (revolver only, suits the western theme).
---
My character developed over time, he did not stumble out of the vault like this. But limiting the number of weapons and trying for low carry weight was the best decision for me, made the game much more intense.
---
I always thought you get allocated to similar  servers
---
What's the secondary and third effect on it?
---
On PC I continuously make trips to fresh players with food, water, stims, radx radaway, ammo upgraded weapons and armor for them. I also have my camp situated near Wayward with open crafting and all ammo except for ultracite is 1cap.
---
Marsupial mutation helps to jump up on the roof to get those pesky roof dwellers!
---
Like how the hell did they survive the trip over there? And Watoga having all those hostile robots etc. 
---
they‚Äôll be no shelter here.
---
Yeah there's definitely still a few bugs with the SBQ fight.
---
Pretty fucked up since that's,  you know THE boss fight for the game right now.
---
I'm on PC and have no friends so it might take a while to do this lol but I want to know
---
Did you have the receiver plan?
---
Damn I wish I would have known Junkie and bloodied were Chase. There are a few people running around right now who bought a few of those from me on the cheap lol
---
you should check out Mamologist its very easy.. its mostly just pictures
---
Depends on the other effects
---
Yeah that's the question. All we need is to be able to deploy an indoor version of the survival tent : a tiny shop space deployable only upstairs at the ws resort
---
They should just use the perk cards they have presently and give us an opportunity to in some way turn them into legendary. Making them permanently active.
---
The hat is rare?
---
You know how there's that perk card that shows grenade trajectory? Would that work here?
---
(covered in the skin of settlers and some piping)
---
Bloodied gatling laser: Vats crits do +50% damage and +50 damage resistence When aiming.
---
The two shot auto grenade explosive no idea
---
I'm only interested in level(s) 53, 59, 62, 82, 92, and 99. The rest is pretty good too. Every weapon should have a skin and make it impossible for anyone to accidentally drop/destroy skinned legendary items like I did.
---
I've got Fire in the Hole (1 rank), it's like I said, there are no cards with the title "Demolition Expert". I did do some searching and one site said that perk is only available if I play Nuclear Winter mode, and from what I see that must be the case.
---
Well if you have the bow built it could be for a lot of damaged
---
Spot on, he‚Äôs a raging alcoholic. Even got the communist scrap bot and everything. Never locks his stuff, literally adores his AP Handmade. He normally walks around with the communist hat (A beanie I think?) from the Atom store on.
---
it will probably resurface, eventually, like that shiny silver/platinum western revolver
---
as far as i have seen, not currently. but who knows. if you tell Bethesda you would open your wallet for some then maybe.
---
No, but they are the reason we can not place shit like we want.
---
Oh ofcourse, that makes sense, thanks!
---
I guess it would, however I don‚Äôt have the perk and I just use their cross hairs to aim
---
Cause right now I have my bow at about 200 damaged
---
HA! Damn that‚Äôs so weird wtf, late night spooky vibes. This is the kinda content I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get from Fallout 76 but am seriously loving haha.
---
 greggmason920 4 president 
---
he gave me the plans for the fixer, for free
---
damn.  cant help you.  but just emote at ppl and they will give u stuff haha
---
No, because you are asking after PvP damage, and that is capped at 120 / shot. So you need more shots, fast. The bow can not do that.
---
Huh? 
---
Please don't put words in my mouth, you are not my wife .)
---
Nope not in the slightest
---
I would sell gatling laser for 2000-3000 and TSE(?) explosive a lot more(I would actually keep it).
---
Once seen someone selling mounted heads for 200 a pop but another player was selling them for only 25 a pop
---
Level 74, and I do not see any perk named "Demolition Expert".
---
since im getting down voted anyway.. this might also serve as a good time to remind you that the responders are all dead... 
---
there is no one left.. thats why the world was empty until the wastelanders came into the picture
---
Thats sadüòÇüò¢
---
They can appear randomly on the corpse of a trick or treater at a random encounter location.
---
If you‚Äôre going to use them and have fun, it‚Äôs worth it. At a certain point caps are worthless so ‚Äòmarket value‚Äô doesn‚Äôt really mean that much
---
So?
---
My simple bloddied HM is at 258, yet does 1.4K /shot on a mob.
---
That just doesn't matter, when you PvP you do damage to a player and that number is capped, irrelevant of what you pip displays.
---
But don't listen to us here, jut go out and test it. You'll see.
---
Yeah it's pretty awesome 
---
Plus gives the option to use the nuke zone itself as cover if you have a jasmay suit, power armor, or a ton of radx
---
Ok I‚Äôll go test it out
---
That was scrip fodder really.
---
bro you might as well be bragging about how fast you can solo mama dolces. ive had to hold back my damage on queens so others can get their hits in for months now, nobody is impressed by instakilling the queen. I have a mule packed full of weapons i could solo the queen with, its not some epic feat you can brag about anymore.
---
I sell all my plans for 13 caps each just to get rid of them
---
If you can enter Ft Defiance most if not all bugs spawn there.  Stingwings are the only ones that aren't common spawns there
---
Oh ok, thank you for this info I will get to hunting these pesky bugs
---
If you can access the elevator start with the third floor.
---
the first time 2 scorched beasts corpses followed me I almost shit my pants
---
They could just have 24 terminals on a wall. Each one has 120 spaces. Basically a remote access for your camp vending machines. 1 for each possible player.
---
and I realize what about the headshot those do damaged right
---
As crazy as this seems I remember a friend on ps4 telling me maniquins move to your camp if you mess with the corpse, I thought he was crazy, but he also said the devs did some weird shit, like the bear in the toilet in the scorched caverns...  I‚Äôm not sure if it was planned as a joke, but  Ive seen them before, the maniquins and avoided them, then I‚Äôve had them move places.
---
damn synths...
---
They followed you because you stole their loot. I mean, that responder wasn't you kill. How could you go loot stealing like that?
---
I'll log in now  - IGN: Lurcher99
---
And get a mic.
---
You can do that until you get around level 25-30 then you will not get many drops
---
My gt is perplexedclown.
---
This is also the way to go if you're not interested in PvP, which is also an important consideration, especially if you're at a low level. If you stay on the server and defend your workshop, you're at risk of getting killed by other players and potentially losing caps and junk items.
---
When you feel confident in going there, pleasant valley ski resort near top of the world has a lot of places they spawn.
---
how to get banned like a fuckin moron 101 right here.
---
I‚Äôm bloodied and if it was me. I‚Äôd roll with the 250 while reloading. If you are wearing unyielding plus one perception is sort of meaningless. 
---
Plus 33 on any shotgun is super op though. It‚Äôs broken in vats and deals more dmg than intended. Amazing shottys, I‚Äôm super jealous.
---
My best gauss shotty has been an Instigating +33 with 25 LVC
---
actually i usually only drop stuff for level 50ish players, because most of the junk legendary gear i get is max level and i want the noob to be able to use it if they want.
---
+1p
---
Answer the damn question
---
The event ‚ÄúBack on the Beat‚Äù is the only way to obtain it. As far as I know.
---
Someone today invited me to a team then he came to my camp, built a fusion generator and a few industrial water purifiers
---
thats not true. ive played with plenty of people from the uk and elsewhere in europe
---
Ikr ?? I love it as well lol as terrifying is that is
---
Wait what ??
---
Thank you for the information good sir!
---
If you're on xbox.  I have a 3*ie assault rifle,  3*aae double barrel shotgun,  various lever actions
---
Fair point
---
The joy of pc.
---
What console and did you join a friend or random server
---
Born to Yeet
---
Yeah they nerfed the heck out of ammo returns with wastelanders. I still get a bit back. But not enough to feed itself, and definetly not enough to be dropping it all the time cuz I had to much lol
---
I though defeating a lvl 32 flat woods monster at L18 was cool
---
Cool no longer helping new people
---
You bored OP?
---
VATS perks are pretty much a non-effect on heavy guns, unfortunately.  And +50 DR isn't that useful either.  So, what you essentially bought is a Bloodied Gatling Laser.  Definitely not worth 15K, but if you have fun with it, you have fun with it.
---
While I know why everyone wants the whitespring, I‚Äôm honestly in favor of Sutton instead. The whitespring already is the npc vendor hall, and one of the few locations still abandoned in the game. I‚Äôd like to keep it that way.
---
Sutton, meanwhile, is where the overseer settled, and in her dialogue, she mentions that she wants to resettle it first. The town itself has a few interesting bits, but overall, nothing worth writing home about, and that makes it a perfect location to turn into a hub, in my mind.
---
Didn't know this was possible. Will keep in mind when I wanna dump inventory.
---
Different to Fo4 they overdid it with some settings in 76 and some need manual adjustment in the .ini files in your Fallout76 folder (Documents/my games/fallout76), mainly the render distances of the world. Some described the default distances with "When you're in Harper's Ferry with default settings The Whitespring Resort is also loaded".
---
I would recommend looking up some of the ini config guides that are on this subreddit.
---
With the help of those I got my game with an R9 390 to 1080p60fps sometimes and around 50-60fps most of the time if not in high-activity zones like a SBQ fight or the Whitespring.
---
If you shoot robots or turrets you get 7-9 back
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Since I've been nuked twice (I was in the center of the circle) I decided to glitch my camp in a mountain.
---
Still got destroyed by nuke.
---
Those are the three I did as well - the syringer was the only part that was a pain.
---
when you said "Rad-monkeys" i instantly thought you wanted a new enemy. a monkey that attacks you by throwing it's glowing crap at you.
---
Ah okay. Thanks!
---
The drop chance Will make you quit
---
If you are trying to place it on roof pieces, that may be the issue. If you change those roof pieces to floor pieces it will place...AND once you place the dome you can remove the floor pieces and it will float!
---
I like this idea too. It'd be cool if there was a zoo in falloit with all types of enemy animals. All mutated.
---
100% solid advice, Ive done that multiple times for low players. Ive also offered to make upgraded gear for people if they have a mic to say what they were using. Generosity abounds from other players rom what ive seen.
---
I had max caps for over a decade now so the caps were not really a big thing for me
---
I hope you bought that
---
Nice and kindly players are like bugs in Fallout. 
---
There are everywhere :) 
---
Fallout community is the nicest i ever met in online games :).
---
Wow, what a divisive  topic. Some fairly strongly worded and personal comments.
---
I know personally, I do not enter underground camps anymore. The first was neat. If the vendors are not above ground, I just move on.
---
DR is useless, do the +1p
---
If you die in the middle of the fight it might reset your dmg count. I swear I‚Äôve experienced this after her dumping tons of ammo into her.
---
When you resort to insults it means you've already lost the arguement. I don't see the issue with ops post. I think the only one having an emotional time right now is yourself.
---
vault 76 is sealed and no way to get back in all door controls were inside the vault
---
As long as it‚Äôs profitable is more likely.
---
1: make bats lvl 10 to 20
---
2: hand out bats to appropriate level while timing
---
3: ???
---
4: profit.
---
You may miss some treasures then.
---
I have a mule account. One is a vendor character that is always online when I'm playing my actual characters. He's not very high level (although thanks to group quest XP, he's actually hit like level 70 now, from about active leveling until about 44). But he's got aaaallll the loot. Vendors are running 60 armor and 60 weapons all the time (as long as stash has room for it anyway- gotta be careful with the heavy weapon loads!)
---
What do you need DR for?
---
Do you have Fallout 76 installed twice? One from Bethesda launcher and one from Steam?
---
If so, those are in different locations and you have to put the mods in the Steam install directory, where you installed...
---
Do you like God stats or slight cushion to your health? My shotgun build uses Bolstering and I still die instantly so I use Uny on my other 3 characters.
---
It was in the atom shop a few weeks back on sale. It comes and goes like everything else, it'll be back again.
---
especially considering it was the blue power ranger that used the big words.
---
poor billy.
---
when they removed legacy weapons they should have also made them untradeable at that time...
---
that seems real fuckin stupid
---
Yeah they are installed to the Steam folder as well.
---
‚ÄúSome may call this junk... Me? I call them treasures.‚Äù 
---
Totally grateful for everyone who has and continues to spread the wealth and help others out. The community (for the most part) is one of my favorite things about the game. I see the occasional griefer, but I see way more who just want to help others out.
---
Back when my wife and I started playing, we were sorta struggling setting up a workshop. (It was our very first time trying it, and we were both very low levels). Didn‚Äôt have a lot of ammo, our gear was mostly broken, and there was a ton of ghouls to clear out. A guy came and helped us clean things up, and he ended up giving us both a Perfect Storm, around 1000 rounds of 10mm each, some stims and food. We were both blown away by that person‚Äôs generosity. He even came back around to help us defend the workshop later on that session. 
---
I‚Äôm still trying to establish my own character (level 94 now), but I try and help by doing similar things, especially with others at workshops.
---
Not really worth the trade off for the bonus special stats imo.
---
Plus I hear you get diminished returns on DR after 500, which I run full unyielding SS armor and with perks I have 593 dr.
---
I like to mix two pieces of bolster to three unyielding. Three have ap refresh. The other two are weight reduced. I also have two with sneak and the others are extra rad resistance.
---
My new main char is a Shotgun/Sniper.    
---
She has no name and has no desire to share any personal info unless she can absolutely trust them. She grew up unlike a lot of girls doing things with 'the boys' and was gifted a BB gun for a birthday. Shooting at targets was only so much fun until  she randomly decided to shoot a squirrel with it. Upon showing her parents you'd think they'd  be angry but not so. Times were bad for many and any source of clean, free meat was a bonus.    
---
Her father taught her more of what he knew and to 'appear' to only take out pests. As she got older she was gifted a larger, more powerful rifle.    
---
It wasn't long after that the War happened and sadly she was separated from her parents. She was a long young girl in a Vault who would be forever changed by the actions of others. Leaving the Vault showed how inexperienced she was. She preferred to go things solo; to carefully evaluate her surroundings before taking any action. She was average in height, weight, and body type so hiding was easier. In an act of desperation after defending her small camp from attackers, she cut off some chunks of flesh from the legs of one of them before disposing of the bodies.    
---
The first bite of human flesh had her hooked. She noticed a different 'flavor' to it than the rest. Knowing how almost anyone she ran into would be very disturbed at this, she would keep it and who she was a secret.    
---
She fashioned a backpack out of a small cooler which ran on a small crank device. It was good b/c it would keep her food fresh. Whenever she would go into a populated area she would change into another set of clothes and hide her things. Eventually word got around of a Cannibal Sniper who would eat from those she killed. She loved the attention and noteriety despite not being able to admit she was the one.    
---
She's not driven by an obsession with it simply as good source of sustenance. She wouldn't turn down normal, cooked meats but savored getting 'the good stuff'. In fact, she's been doing it so long that her body responds better to human flesh than normal meat.    
---
She has a somewhat morally good heart but won't hesitate to change at the blink of an eye to save her own ass. Early on, she managed to find a hunting rifle and has modded it to be the best it can with a more military look, medium range scope and supressor which she meticulously cleans to keep in the best condition.    
---
She loves creating confusion firing shots from a long distance and seeing enemies freak. The screams after seeing a head explode are very entertaining knowing what psychological damage has done to them even before everyone is dead.
---
Do you happen to remember the location of this place ?
---
I just get tired of people messaging me to trade for one of my weapons but i know my friends or club wouldnt complain
---
Unyielding benefits prices, speech checks, carry weight. And if you use Melee, damage. My best armor set is full 3 star unyielding.
---
people on the market sub are looking to barter...
---
also nice slip around the trade in the title automod...
---
also also.. rule 10
---
Probably, the mods have been messed up for a while now. There was a mod simply called bladed (which I think is fixed now) that was for boards or pool cues or something, all excavator mods were missing the excavator tag (not sure if fixed), auto grenade launcher long barrel was called "auto grenade launcher launcher long barrel" (fixed with wastelanders, lol only took a year and a half), and many weapons have standard mods as a mod box
---
Well now I have to
---
no witch hunting yo..
---
This is why I've been grinding low level good legendary's because I have way to much scrip and caps. I've been grinding rare plans and recipes for lower levels.
---
You should leave the house more, stop making a big deal over nothing üôÑ
---
Hmmm, I wonder if the Steam version has different location for the Custom .ini file too, Im not familiar with it...
---
One of my best friends I met on 76 I was a level 25 before wastelanders and he came along to camp invited me to a team built me a fusion generator upgrade all my defences, built me an awesome camp and then helped me defeat the imposter sheepsquatch. Thankyou Tyler :D
---
Not witch hunting, just warning.
---
You'll always find griefers on the game unfortunately
---
It happened today. It is rare, last time it happened in april. 
---
Most player can behave at others camp, only a few can not.
---
Damn, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.
---
Don‚Äôt farm kindness you ingrates
---
Remove them from the game
---
Never launched a nuke myself, but I go farming when they land. Morgantown by far had the largest output and could support the most farmers.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs great. And launching nukes isn‚Äôt all that hard so i encourage you to!
---
Level 45 Junkies explosive FR The Fixer.  Sadly Im a melee heavy weapons build.
---
It‚Äôs moments like this that kept me in the game, I got to around the same level and had no ammo, caps and crappy armour, but then a dude dropped me enough stuff to have around 7000 caps. I love this community
---
What a sad sad bunch. Thanks for a warning!
---
&gt; No witch-hunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use Bethesda's official support pages. **Do not name and shame in general.**
---
Bc you can share perks that give +x% to exp.
---
Nominor effects trigger this bug.
---
Unpopular opinion i know but remove them or make em UT
---
Have hundreds of hours on my account and I never encountered griefers I think you just had bad luck
---
I try to do the same when I can! Unfortunately there is some people who do the exact opposite. Showed my friend the game and when he was around level 20 I told him how he can get fusion cores by claiming a workshop. This level 600 came and took it over and told him to go to a different power plant then he proceeded to take that power plant too. Eventually he had all 3. I couldnt take home in pvp as I am a level 100 so I nuked all 3. Then him and his 3 other friends all 200+ proceeded to cryolate us for about an hour. I was chill tho at least they wernt getting there fusion cores wasting there time on us.
---
I can‚Äôt think of anything more off putting than having a gang of 10 year old grieving someone because they‚Äôre in a different faction and on their server.
---
eh, I heard the fedbois were watching our conduct in this game, especially as regards that particular activity. I always feel like I'm being watched when I  play  this game and it's anxiety provoking. Like, I have  trouble reading a book in a room with other people in it, or an open door. Really wish I could play offline.
---
From now on any new levels come to my camp expecting free handouts are going to get explosive bait and a nuke mine .... begging barstewardsüòÄüòÇüòÇüòÇTalk about taking advantage!
---
I do this but because I‚Äôm lazy I just list plans at the default value.
---
I just need to know what perkcards work for them either way haha
---
Fuck Bethesda. You act like they had stellar communication in the first place.
---
Amazing what a little paint can do.
---
Like, I feel like I'm sort of performing my gameplay in the current format and it is highly irritating, if you get that?
---
People like you are the problem when some asshole does this shit yeah let everyone know so it won't happen to them. Your just as bad by doing nothing and keeping quiet.
---
I'll at least give a couple of stacks of fusion cores to a low level if they cant claim a base to save them some trouble.
---
They are under INT.  There's a perk under PER that gives you an idea of the grenade's arc at lvl 3.
---
He is on PS4 tho
---
That‚Äôs fair I guess, just list something right away and hope for the best lol
---
He is playing on PS4
---
rules exist for a reason
---
allmost the best you can get...
---
Time for another vault heist to get all the party stuff out of there lmao
---
Desk fans in Whitesprings bunker...toy cars/trucks in Whitesprings cabins. My Christmas scrap bot gives me toys.
---
Wear a stealth suit.  1000 rad resistance and a decent amount of armour.  (Not great but ok)
---
Depends on whether you plan to use specific shotgun perk cards, even at that it's not great.
---
If you're asking if in general it's a good weapon I would say no. Scrip it for 40.
---
You dont really they'll do insane damage even not being perked out properly
---
Blame Besthesda for my pricesü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I know what witch hunting is, which is why I said 'not witch hunting'. Please show me at which point did I tell people to attack the player?? No, I just warned people that if you try and buy something from their camp that they will kill you for your loot.
---
i‚Äôve never heard of that, but i guess that could be happening
---
That would be nice but what would you do to rebalance them if you couldn't do either of the previous options
---
&gt; but not so impossible that there is almost no chance to get it  
---
This is how I feel trying to grind for good SS armor or a good Fixer. The SS armor feels possible (crafted 11 chest pieces yesterday but they were all garbage). The fixer, on the other hand, feels like chasing the Holy Grail..
---
Okay thanks! I‚Äôm building a new character and thought I‚Äôd try junkies this time so hopefully I come across something nicer
---
You‚Äôre being ripped into because you‚Äôre ignoring something that is clearly better just so you can have the vanity of a ‚Äúchallenge.‚Äù Meanwhile, I‚Äôll happily one-shot enemies all day with my bloodied shit. This post is stupid and it‚Äôs a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.
---
You need professional help.
---
&gt; So if you come across TH3ANGR3GAM3R's camp
---
&gt; Do not name and shame in general.
---
i normally just take everything that isn't nailed down while i wander in circles
---
I think I did, well I'm hoping at least. Every encounter I've had with other players has been great, it's a lovely community but there's always some that have to spoil it
---
&gt; to spend so much and still be so cut off from so much is pretty whack. if we all keep paying, Bethesda is only going to keep creeping closer and closer to EA turf. end of rant.  
---
Agreed, and good/valid points.
---
Will it make you feel better if I remove the name??
---
I've (somewhat recently) heard of this glitch. I'm sure there's a specific way to trigger it if someone wants to. I've just never had a reason to.
---
Complex. Would make up a good companion for any fallout game. Slowly opening up whilst doing the companion quests you experience her background story and find out while she refuses to dine with you and goes on solo nightly hunting trips. Full xompanion level (is it called like that?) would unlock special benefits from canibal perk for your char. Hope bethesda reads your post!
---
My Ben, left the refuge with the illusion of rebuilding America, but seeing all the mess of the scorched decided to take advantage of all the Vaultec technology for his benefit, he only carries a 10mm automatic, and collects ammunition to sell in his CAMP
---
Don‚Äôt try to shoot them thru, shooting immediately ends dross toss with a dross toss loss.
---
I sure that 100 will just be it. This is a replacement for what we have now.

Waster bundle
---
This guys a Fucken joke and people like him are the problem encouraging and allowing this to happen. Like most say all games have a shitty few who like to torment other players and ruin it for them. Just ignore them and keep going!
---
R.I.P.
---
They‚Äôve given no indication that there will be daily/weekly Atom challenges after Seasons rewards are all earned‚Äîor for the weeks in between Seasons. 
---
Each Season will last 10 weeks, 4 per year, which means 3 weeks between each or some other arrangement of the off weeks. If they‚Äôre smart, they‚Äôre planning on dropping story expansions &amp; new events during the off weeks. That‚Äôll give players a reason to keep logging in, then by the time they burn out on that or finish it, it‚Äôll be time for another Season to start.
---
The last time i started playing a new character a \*legendary\* player stopped by a train station where i was at. He saw me and dropped a maxed out vault 76 jumpsuit. The one that adds like +2 to almost all of your SPECIAL! That's like... WOW! +2 on almost all stats?! That's insane!
---
When i got to above level 50, I passed the jumpsuit a random low level player and i'm sure it made something wonderful and unforgettable adventure where hopefully someday that player will also pass-on the item to the next one if that player hasn't yet keeping the tradition going.
---
its a little late for that now...
---
That is only for the base model.  Mods use their full weight.
---
I have some better advice: Advise new players to ask.
---
If a low level player asks me for some supplies I gladly give him some
---
Oh, really? Awesome, thanks for letting me know!
---
I can see it happening with the one Appalachia system, will probably rebalance a lot of stuff
---
Please fix all of the headwear in the game that removes other items that seem like they shouldn‚Äôt need be removed to wear, &amp; all of the items that removes facial hair as well. Such as the wrapped cap, surgical masks, bandanas (there should be more stalker bandana style ones as well in different colors, it looks awesome but it also removes facial hair), some helmets, masks, etc. Also, the hooded rags (a really cool looking outfit in my opinion) removes all of your armor equipped, so there‚Äôs that as well if it wasn‚Äôt intentional. While you‚Äôre at it, add a white hair color that actually matches the Mr. Claus beard! OR add more beards. That is all.
---
How would you go about rebalancing now if you had your choice
---
Yooooo. This is righteous. You are a service to the community.
---
Senseless voilence. So I was told by a level 450 the other day.
---
Player hub? Yes
---
Auction House? Hell no please
---
I have not played a single MMO-type game where the addition of an Auction House DIDN'T have a dramatic negative effect on the game. It's one of those features that when it's missing, it seems like a good idea, but then when it comes I wish it never would've come in the first place.
---
Great weapon for a vats shotgun build (which is the way to go) because it's a bugged weapon doing insane damage.
---
And the damage isn't that far of bloodied with all addictions + unyeilding armor
---
Yes, I do, and I get some from time to time. You know the system is broken everywhere so, it's not as simple as showing up and drinking the kool-aid. Apparently you have to be lucky too.
---
Rework them to get the same explosive effect that the new Gauss weapons have, ensure that damage is divided properly among beams when splitters are applied, not multiplied. Then add them back into the drop pool. This change should be accompanied by a general buff to energy weapons and a buff to their durability. This would keep them viable and desirable, but not because of broken effects, as they are now.
---
You wait till the next season.
---
Sick roll
---
My fix would be to add them back into the loot pool. As is.
---
it may be an unpopular opinion but i think they should leave the legacy weapons as is.
---
they should re-add the current explosive prefix back to energy guns, but with a few small changes. those changes would be "Energy projectiles explode for area damage". this version would shoot fast moving, bright purple projectiles that operate exactly like explosive bullets, dealing +25% damage for the explosions. 
---
as for the Flamer and Cryolator id say to do the same thing, except make the projectile a bright blue (its either super hot, or super cold)
---
Like most of the things in this game, 90%wr effect is bugged and only works on base weapon. Any mods you change / upgrade will not be calculated. Only way to properly reduce weight of heavy guns is by using Lock and Load perk.
---
There's also a sound bug with cyolators, if another player has the weapon equipped then eveyone around him can hear It but he can't and it makes a  horrible looping grinding noise. I've never seen anyone complain about it, but it only happens when another player has a cryo out.
---
2\* rolls are the best to have your first good rolls weapon
---
I would be heavy handed about it.. I'd nuke the whole market for that stuff by making them untradeable.. /unpopular opinion
---
Also when I say heard I mean read an article. They didn't like Bethesda aggrandizing the launching on nuclear missiles.
---
I don't help out new players as often as I use too, but occasionally I'll chase one, or a few, down and give them random, yet helpful, stuff.
---
I'll even look for a low level on the map that's not really near a destination, and assume they are building their camp. So I'll chase them down to make sure. If they are, I'll drop my survival tent somewhere near by and grab them materials and extra plans. I tend to need to cap sink a good bit, so I go buy plans like advanced power connectors, fusion generators, etc, and drop those off too.
---
All camp plans, (except rare ones like the glitter ball, cuckoo clock, etc) are 25 caps a piece on my vending machines.
---
Being a collector I try not to give away too many rare items. If hunting for them entertains me, it probably does others too, right?
---
Being a friendly player, and other friendly players, have kept me playing this game all through the...shit... that's went, and still, goes on.
---
üòÜ
---
I have no way of knowing if this was actually true.. nor do you
---
also, everybody needs professional help of some kind, so a bit asinine
---
*fucking cries in napalm*
---
Why and for what reason
---
Is it actually bugged? Like did Beth admit that or is it just an awful design decision? I struggle sometimes to know the difference with this game. If it's a design decision we might convince them to change it... If it's bugged it'll never change.
---
Sooo I may as well just toss it into the purveyor then? 
---
Well it does have extra damage to bugs which is better than a standard flamer so I guess I'll hold onto it til I get another legendary flamer in like 3 months ;_;
---
We don't know if it's bugged or not, but they certainly haven't seen fit to actually fix (or even comment on) it if it is.
---
Purely random, I try to do the quests regularly because they are the only plans that sell for their stated price or better.
---
a2nd would be my guess
---
It's obviously bugged. Would not make any sense if it weren't. Also why would Lock and Load work perfectly?
---
it depends, it could be a mule character he is using to offload surplus stuff.
---
Ahh okay
---
It‚Äôs come back a few times..
---
 Oh man, the thirst for vengeance is too real
---
That sir is called mule
---
I have been chasing a lvl 9 for 5 minutes yesterda through the toxic wastes, trying to give him some some of the plans I am not selling and have in surplus. 
---
I should really invest in microphone. Beats shooting the ground to get their attention.
---
That's a cool idea
---
The only benefits I can see are for the buffd and the weekly challenge for completing 10 events while in a group/team.
---
The season has a finite number of things to do and collect, in this case 100.
---
Once you hit 100, you're done until season 2.
---
It wasn't bloodied that caused that damage. It was limb damage.
---
This would be a solid idea
---
beats me. i was wondering the same
---
It's been encouraging to see that there are a number of women players of this game.
---
its just a mule
---
I always thought it swapped between current and last weapon used. If the last weapon isn‚Äôt available then it moves to unarmed. 
---
Someone current me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
Also when I say heard I mean read an article. They didn't like Bethesda aggrandizing the launching of nuclear missiles. Of course, the article was fed to me by facebook so, maybe the russians just want me to think that? lol, too much nuka-quantum
---
ah yes one game content patch 2 years after the game comes out? how long did i take u to finish wastelanders lmfao
---
Id remove them entirely from the game.
---
i agree with all except the hooded rags should stay as they are.  makes u more of a badass if ur running around Appalachia with no protection.   boss outfit üòé
---
This is the type of stuff that makes this game so great.
---
Nothing
---
so if enough people put someone's name down there's a high chance it happened? But because the rules it can't be which is illogical. Why do you think they remove people on the trade sub for scamming? but here you can't because if someone does Greig/harrass it's witch hunting... no it's not it's giving a Fucken warning about assholes ruining the game for people. Personally if I see a post ill still go to the person camp if I see it on the map but I'll be way more careful without you could easily get grieffed? So what's the problem with putting a name up it'll just raise awareness and if it happens enough then it'll get to the front page so unless your actually doing it your not getting to the front page.  grow up kid. I hope you never have kids or raise them to think it's okay to be a asshole for no reason to other peopleAfter looking through the type of responds you give to people in post you can easily tell you are the problem and just a shitty person and you endorse this. Your just as bad as the person who does this.
---
FO 1ST FTW!
---
Read some of the top replies. My two cents, take your time, it's not a race. Explore, gather, build or do whatever, don't burn through the content fast. Collect all the holotapes and notes/letters. There is a lot of new neat lore to learn.

Second is don't be afraid if a higher level is shadowing you. A lot of us get bored sometimes and will follow a new player around and see how they are fairing, don't be alarmed or get hostile, if we see your struggling or really new we generally drop some helpful aid items to make those early levels a little bit easier like EXP buff food and purified water.
---
what the heck? üòÇ they really think we are going to try and launch a nuke in real life or something
---
Can you explain?
---
This was my understanding.  So when I equip my shotgun then equip the heavy (gauss minigun) then those should be the 2 weapons bound to the d-pad for quick swap, but it's like it just ignores the gauss minigun.  But like I said, if it's just a regular minigun, it works fine.

mule
---
There will probably be a downtime so there is no real time also you need to say your timezone otherwise nobody can help you
---
I don't know either.
---
Just wanna comment.
---
i dont make the rules.. they exist for a reason
---
if you want to know why a certain rule is in place on this sub.. I suggest asking a moderator, Im sure they can clear it up for you
---
Have A Nice Day.. GL in your future endeavors...
---
thanks for the tip.
---
Haha that‚Äôs crazy smart! Fallout ghost stories, thank you devs!
---
FO 1st lets you run a private world.  Farm to your hearts content with nobody to bother you.
---
Private servers. Everything for yourself.
---
I have noticed lately when server hopping I end up back on same servers. It might be a cloud region tendency. For example AWS and Azure have west, central, south central, east, east 2 regions for US and possibly that plays a role for latency and ping time thresholds for world selection. So if you are on  on east coast and because of time of day has less of a pool of players you might end up on same server in the east. I‚Äôve noticed that if my camp is in a popular spot I get more server variety so there might be a logic that says ok servers in you region have conflict with CAMP well then I‚Äôll go to west or central region now, if that make sense. Not sure what cloud backend Bethesda uses.
---
I have a subreddit I post on that has rules..
---
will you follow them?
---
subbed! awesome!
---
With FO 1ST (Fallout First) you can have your own, private worlds, where you can claim all the workshops without the risk of other players killing you for them. You can also invite friends to such worlds, too (or, if you have a friend who's subscribed to Fallout First, they made invite you as well).
---
Private world to keep the douchebags out
---
Best kept secret.  Whenever it's nuked people seem to ignore it.  Allows me to farm harden mass
---
Looks like im getting fallout 1st !
---
r/vaultdwellercouture started like 3 hrs before u posted haha
---
Legendary power armor?  That would be cool
---
Carry-on corpses haha
---
I would wear a cape if I could. Hope they one day release a dracula like cap for Halloween or something.
---
no problem
---
PS4. I have no idea how I would arrange to get something? Is there a way to log onto the same server?
---
I had the exact issue you're having.  These others responses hit the nail on the head.  I really hated the FO76 community (sorry, but you high-level guys are bored assholes) until I found out I could farm on my own private server, and then it CHANGED MY LIFE.
---
ALSO, the scrap bin alone is WORTH IT!
---
OK I must just be having very bad luck.
---
it was great. i had it all to myself. maybe i should take this post down. lol
---
Try it for a month and see for yourself.  You probably won't go back!
---
The mission terminal will work in power armor and allow you to go underground.
---
Immediately please lol
---
Exactly, I couldn't without it.
---
they shouldnt do anything about them, bethesda has a hundred other problems to deal with that they should focus on.
---
OK, so completing that first, might be earning the gold while still working on other stuff?
---
PC here, but I find the interior for Arktos Pharma has some really heavy frame stuttering. More often than not however, the server will do it, probably to take a shot at the Legendary Sheepsquatch that shows up.
---
It takes to much coordination for random to complete with all 3 animals alive. And if you don't keep all 3 alive you can't get the best rewards. Basically it takes to much effort and has to great a risk to fail
---
because its a PITA?
---
Once you remove them how would you change the effect
---
I just message the player.
---
Could be a bug? It doesn‚Äôt work with the camera so maybe the wastelanders weapons are bugged also. I would submit a ticket.
---
Unless ya have a whole server with a plan you cant get the best rewards and I have even failed with the event with like 5 or 6 guys a few times.
---
So peeps dont like investing ammo and stimpaks for and evemt thats likely to fail or at best not give good returns for not being a perfect run.
---
Well, bigger patches take a few hours (4-6). So, calculate with this.
---
Rule 10. Head to the trading sub.
---
Sure! What‚Äôs your subreddit called?
---
probably around the usual time
---
Apm1485 got you, just send me a friend request and I‚Äôll join your game
---
actually bethesda would probably delete every gun BUT the legacies if they attempted to remove them.
---
but i agree, there are many, many, many more pressing issues to deal with.
---
The main reason I see for jetpacks is more the brief ability to get somewhere faster or occasionally that wouldn't have been accessible at all. I wouldn't really actively use one in combat, except possibly to get to higher ground against opponents that aren't Scorchbeasts.
---
There would be no need as they no longer exist in game.  Legacy weapons are the biggest reason why pvp will never work outside of nuclear winter where they already do not exist.
---
I have a similar amount of those weapons on my weapon mule and haven't duped a single one.
---
If you want to try farming you can jump onto my server.  But for the full experience (scrap bin = no scrap weight limit) you'll have to pay for it yourself.
---
Ok thats fair
---
ok
---
Can‚Äôt do that on PC.
---
Guilty of "nah just 2 guys there"
---
That‚Äôs a novel approach for sure.  I would recommend just buying serums from player vendors to get the ones you want initially.  Some of them have no relevance yet heavy consequence for certain builds/weapons.  Some people will use electrically charged /unstable isotope to initiate PvP.  I only use a few myself.  The strategy I recommend is a late game cap sink for players with lots of caps and nothing to do with them.  If you‚Äôre just looking to get mutated many players sell the serums that you will want.
---
Bear Arms, Lock and Loaded is for reload time reduction.
---
Hmmm close but you left out the delivery notification which is really crucial to the whole operation
---
Friendly Fire works on nearby players and NPCs *if you are doing events* as it counts them as in your team (aka you can't hurt other players while in events). I was healing the robots in Fasnacht and you can heal the NPCs in Radiation Rumble.
---
Their Tesla may have had a perk which heals team mates and if you're in an event that should work for everyone too.
---
Fingers crossed amirite
---
My stashbox üòÅ
---
I agree, loads of glowing ones for radiation fluids and plenty of cobalt. One of the best places for it In fact.
---
Does it let you buy it? I saw a guy that had atom cat X-01s and some hacked items in their vendor all at 1 cap each and it wouldn't let me buy any of it :(
---
That‚Äôs really dumb. Just like the fact that PC and XBox can‚Äôt play together, so many games can, be not something as popular as Fallout 76. Missed opportunities man.
---
I don‚Äôt get all the hand wringing over explosive energy weapons in the first place.  Why this and only this?  What were they doing that someone with a junkie/bloodied/gauss build isn‚Äôt doing?
---
Yeah I have the same issue as well now that you point it out.  I‚Äôve probably killed her 26+ times on my main character and it hasn‚Äôt registered.
---
The real challenge is getting them to believe the gift emote tbh without using voice chat
---
I keep praying that *some* day Bethesda will see the light and make ammo bulking a possibility. I don‚Äôt see 1 cap for 1 round a good trade for all ammos. But 1 cap for *15* rounds might be.
---
Use a different browser
---
Indeed it's needed and would be a great addition to the game.
---
It'll never come and if it did it would be so buggy and annoying that it would forever kill the game.
---
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been asking for it since B.E.T.A.
---
Dude that would be genius. If they implemented a system in this game similar to the WoW Auction House, I feel it would be a fantastic change. I'm currently at a point where my stash is full because of my vendors and I'm having to run around with an extra 200 lbs. of legendaries due to the 150 daily scrip limit.
---
If they gave us an AH that we could put stuff into that didn't affect our stash, I think they'd see a rise in player satisfaction as well as a stop to the vendor/stash bugs.
---
Especially since there is 0 cobalt when nuking the SBQ. White springs has a lot of cobalt but you have to look for it. Morgantown is superior
---
So what you are saying is the bug reporting process is also bugged? Makes sense. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I always wondered why higher level players did this, But after several months of having to juggle my stash budget I find myself hiding materials, ammo, and plans in the suitcases at the Morgantown train station all the time.
---
i want a backpack with a baby and a changing station in my camp!
---
I went to a camp on Seneca yesterday, arrived on a sliver of rock under the base, deep inside the mountain. Travelled to base again and arrived safely on top. This was the weirdest one so far.
---
Just codifying speedruns for the community
---
mostly just salt from people who dont have them. its the same people who bitch and bitch and bitch about bloodied this, OP that, PLZ nerf. no fun allowed. 
---
the only real thing that sets legacy energy weapons apart is that the explosive splash damage didnt receive the nerf that everything else did back when TSE got nerfed into oblivion.
---
I mean, im just wondering how anyone is gonna see any of these score levels outside of redditors bragging about it, might catch a sniff of the rewards for certain levels but i dont think theyre shown anywhere else
---
oh yea, i'm a idiot
---
What system do you play on?
---
Maybe it's linked to a cancelled quest in valley galeria where the mannequins were alive and you must choose your side between the mannequins or the galeria's computer.
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs forcing people, he‚Äôs just visiting and people out of the kindness of their hearts give stuff. If people visit I probably will help them, if they‚Äôre looking for a handout which is rare I probably won‚Äôt do anything. If they‚Äôre just quietly visiting I usually help
---
I don't mind nukes at all. But I guess that's because they rarely hit me, even when I'm targeted dead center.
---
Wait, what?!  
---
There‚Äôs a version of the 76 jumpsuit that adds to a bunch of your SPECIALs? How have I not heard of this yet?
---
This really helps in PP.
---
Sugar Grove for both screws and springs
---
Usually the only 2 guys there are level 10 - 20 and you know youll be the person carrying them unless you get lucky and other high levels show up
---
I‚Äôm glad I haven‚Äôt run into that one yet lol. 
---
Sounds just as bad...
---
I ain't bragging anything. What I'm saying is, to tell the difference, you should kill her solo not with teammates. How are you talking about damage difference between builds when you are dpsing the queen with bunch of your friends? Since damage numbers are not reliable, you should solo her and see how much damage you are actually doing if you want to talk about damage difference between builds. I done that already now's your turn
---
Hotplates too
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen the same thing in that area, but it was a while ago.  Also I'm pretty sure I was just heading straight south along that road, and the events all happened in order and made more sense.  Another string of related events happened there with dead brahmin, once.  Again, this was a while ago, well before Wastelanders.
---
This is a question that I would also like to know the answer to.
---
‚ÄúI love the smell of napalm in the morning‚Äù
---
I'd reccomend a shotgun, specifically a magic one. You wouldn't need perks for damage just whip.it out and vats them.
---
Hey man if ya on xbox I‚Äôll get ya some ammo sometime as well
---
I had a good experience like 2 weeks ago where I bought 3 Legendaries totalling over 12,000 caps at some dudes C.A.M.P so I saw he was showing other guns he had for sale on a gun rack so I messaged him if I can have the insane legendary he had for 6,000 caps and he gave it to me for free. I love players like this guy.
---
Doing this is honestly what‚Äôs making the game actually fun rn at least until the next update
---
I have 20 Fixer plans...the grind is real.
---
The dude that dupped the hell out of matts ahaha :)
---
waiting for the post of the player who tried to transfer plans to his mule character rofl
---
I check people‚Äôs camp all the time and haven‚Äôt had any luck with people selling them.
---
The buddy I talked into playing [PC] ends up near the same people a lot.
---
His internet sucks. 
---
I end up randomly all over.
---
Always assumed his crappy internet has problem finding a server and just sticks him with other crappy internet players.
---
I've wanted the diffuser plan from the first day this event came out.
---
Still don't have it. I'm 205 but I still can't solo this, and if there isn't at least four other people I know it's not getting completed at all.
---
Half the time your entire team can be present and you still won't be able to get the level 3 creature to spawn because not enough event enemies/items appear. So frustrating.
---
I usually have a bunch for sale 1/5 price in my vendors, and when I have too many extras I give them to newer players. I dumped 100 plans last night on 2 level 8 players who were playing together.
---
I really love this event, it would be so great if we could trigger it ourselves like encryptid or scorched earth.  I think people avoid it because you really need a couple of good people per room be successful.  Many of us have done the event many times only to have it fail at the very end because people abandon their friendly animals to try and get a shot on the alpha legendary.  It takes real coordination to complete; just like the sheep event, some people will have to take on a role as a guardian and not worry about getting a shot at the alpha.
---
i cant say that i have had this happen before.
---
do you have ammo for the weapon? im assuming yes, but i do know if you dont have ammo it will toggle to the next "last used" weapon
---
I know my damage in groups because of Meter76, an addon that measures all damage dealt by players nearby. it stopped working a long time ago when power armor frames got an update and it moved the "source" of the damage from the player to the frame and it broke the way the meter works.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/342
---
No where my second nuke is going now
---
I suspected that as well.  Both weapons were fully loaded.
---
you can either use the walk button to force yourself to walk (PC) Crouch so you move slower to stay on, or take a suit of power armor with a jetpack and use it to jump back up if you fall. marsupial also helps with that. i also found that part a lot easier in first person instead of 3rd person
---
Dont the servers tend to match you with people geographically close for it's own ease?
---
Sup. I usually xp farm west tek. And golf course. Then server hop.
---
IGN is Sergeant-Cabbage
---
Xbox. And probably both tbh.
---
Yea I'm trying to finish the tadpole too, just need to milk some Brahmin and revive a player
---
I bought 2 sets of modded Excavator and a load of shielded underarmors to clear caps and give away.
---
Agreed. Last thing we need is a reason for them to try and 'dominate' the servers for their streams.. Ugh.
---
I own multiple even gave away some for PvP events ive hosted in recent months, saying they arnt unbalanced is wrong , they are absurd but I will say fun to play with
---
I gave a lvl 3 a fully modded impro weapon with 100 45. Ammo i think he liked it
---
Thank you for your advice, and one more question for the concentrated fire, is there any huge difference between 1 point and 3 points?
---
Nice, glad to see that players look out for one-another
---
try a different browser for the bug submission, and for the building I would try relaunching the game. sometimes when I build a wall will be invisible, but still be somewhere attached to things, and it wont let me build over the invisible wall or remove the last thing attached to it
---
Thanks.
---
Add me on ps4 if you wantüôÉ"jcxcovert"
---
Btw thats super nice
---
The other day a really high level of like nearly 600 dropped so many chems. Like 40 stimpaks, 60 super stimpaks, tons or radaway, mentats, and just so much else. I took it all and fast traveled to the overseers camp and ran away giving it away to low levels. Then, before I logged off I stashed it all in the overseers stash box and a few luggages outside of train stations. I also like to leave 10mm ammo for them as it's so common for me to grab and and I don't need it.
---
they will probably take it down for maint at 8-10 am est then do the patch and say sorry still working on it every hour till its up at 2-6 pm est
---
A hub what would allow a small amount of items to be sold such as Five could maybe work, so people could sell their most popular or expensive items there while people would still need to go to camps for most things.
---
Then you obviously know there's sheer difference in damage between builds. Why are we having this conversation then? Denial?
---
It's one of the random encounters. I've seen them tons of time
---
I‚Äôve heard it is possible to actually do 100% bonus damage while junkies while bloodied can only reach around 90% but I‚Äôm not super familiar with the build
---
too bad they would end up being cosmetic like all the other normal helmets in game  (gas masks excluded)
---
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
---
BGS needs to get the lead out on passing out the bans.
---
Shits getting old 
---
Tired of seeing camps with hundreds of the plans from the Large Gifts.
---
I ran with a 1star for weeks until I got a swing speed one.but yeah fss is damn good on any melee
---
It took me ten plus tries but I got it. I had to go slow and barely passed the actual obstacle test. I seriously had a second left. I was beyond frustrated
---
I have 3 mules. 1 level 5, and two were alts to test builds on. the level 5 is funny, as it has all the best stuff in its stash lol. its mostly weapon/armor/trade items on him
---
It‚Äôs a matter of survival for me I live in the swamps and mostly spawn in water. If I don‚Äôt wear it I have parasites everytime I go home. It also does in fact says it prevent it. The issue is the helm for the Chinese stealth armor says the same but it in fact does not due to a glitch.
---
If you're on xbox make a LFG post. I just did and about 10 people showed up.
---
The other day I found a ton of junk in a lunchbox at Whitesprings Station, best part was 117 screws.
---
Typewriters are a good choice..
---
"That for this, this for that"
---
Yeap sounds like a fucked up travel point. I prolly had my ass stuck there a few hundred times as well. The peak right next to the seneca symbol on the map is where you have this huge cave which doesn't help. Its the reason i built into there in the first place.
---
I really want Kellogg‚Äôs outfit to show up in the Atomic Shop.
---
Wow wht a generous player, and you as well for helping all the new players.
---
You need to have learned the prime plan for one on the Gatlin laser weapons
---
Get the marsupial mutation? Should allow you to jump from the ground and hit those markets on the balance beam.
---
I think. Don't know for sure as I did that course without a problem a year and a half ago.
---
nobody ever said bloody wasnt the best build. I pointed out that sneak attack crits are doing the heavy lifting and you didnt like that. I backed up my point by linking a video of sneak attack crits being enough to kill the SBQ easily, but you want to say its the bloody build doing all the work. if that were true, you could solo the SBQ as a bloody build without sneak, but you cant. yet any sneak attack crit build can solo the SBQ without even being legendary.
---
Sneak attacks are the MVP. end of story. you cant do your big numbers without sneak, even with the perfect bloody build.
---
Thank you. I figured most people would have tried to sell it all either in their own vendor or at a train station. But I felt that it would be better used to give it away to help out others. it just seems in the beginning it's difficult to find that stuff and later on it's all you have. Ha
---
GorrilafingerüòÇwhat a great name
---
If you're collecting Teddy Bears I would strongly suggest Tyler County Fairgrounds, if you look around you can find most of the Teddy Bears there.
---
Hell yeah, that's a classic. I'm sure it would sell like crazy. They could just give it another name like they did with the minuteman general, Ranger and Maxson coat outfits
---
Gas masks aren't even special anymore.  Any type of face covering does the same thing as a gas mask now.  Got changed to be that way close to a year ago.  Those over powered gas  masks were cutting into atomic shop sales apparently!
---
Now that is a true madlad
---
Nah but you can upgrade the jumpsuit the bos underarmor and the enclave suit. Lined, treated, and shielded. Adds 1 2 and 3 energy and damage resistance
---
A man of legend
---
I just got mine through scrapping. No wrong way to scrap. Just sometimes takes awhile to get what you want.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought
---
I avoid it because half of the time there aren't enough players until the event is almost over and then suddenly there's so many who didn't actually do shit but want that reward. And the other half someone runs around intentionally killing the friendly animals so we fail.
---
Do you know what it‚Äôs slang for ?
---
I absolutely agree sneak attacks do a big role in doing big damage on the queen. I never denied that. But sneak attacks dealt with bloodied builds and the same done with full health builds have big difference. This is what I'm trying to tell you . But you keep saying 'duh sneak damage is awesome' I mean what the hell bro. That's totally out of context.
---
HHmmm interesting. The terminal could even let you load in a photo of your camp or something. A theme or the like. Could be fun.
---
Nah, i asked him if it comes in red and he said no :(.
---
Where would I go about making one of those post?
---
Heya! As BoS soldier mentioned I co-run BoS Operation: hOpE4FUTURE and we record our RP sessions and post them here:
---
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCttguHjTeFTTUQCGqbdbIFA
---
We have an ongoing cohesive storyline for our take on the local BoS made up of vault 76 survivors that picked the banner up after finding Appalachia in ruins.
---
This is a great tip! Takes 2 minutes.
---
marsupial yo
---
thank me later
---
I'll have to say though that I actually did quite a lot of damage to her, although hard to actually see all the numbers when VATS'ing with a double barrel. But with my first lvl50+ character with a naive build and laser gatling that'd do 1/2 damage per shot to her only, I had always gotten the rewards. So aside from your tip with the anti armor, those fights I was talking about were definetly griefed. There were like 20 players or so and probably around 15 of them were quite pissed about it.
---
It might make a big difference on something like a hunting rifle or combat rifle but the damage on a gauss is so high that they should be dead on the first hit and if not they shouldn't survive a second. 
---
Just had a look and these are the numbers for concentrated fire 1-3
---
 \+1/2/3% damage.
---
\+10/15/20% hit chance with non-automatic weapons.
---
\+2/3/4% hit chance with automatic weapons.
---
as you can see the damage increase is minimal and the hit chance only goes up 10%
---
The game prioritizes placing you in lobbies with previously met players and friends. It's matchmaking designed to simulate a slightly static world
---
You can tell me just tell me the time in your timezone. I will change it to mine.
---
0.o
---
You won't get banned for having one of these. Making them and selling them and flashing them around... Maybe. But they aren't doing sweeps of EVERYONEs characters to see if they have a legendary pa, especially since it just chills as PA chassis in your inventory
---
this
---
Ok so since your not as informed
---
Junkies max damage increase is 50 percent, requires 5 different addictions that dont hinder your build.
---
Bloodied max damage increase is based on what percentage of health your at seems to cap at 90 percent thou, 
---
The explosive effect on laser is still a 100 percent increase plus the fact the splitter multiples damage instead of dividing damage, now imagine adding any relevant effect on top of that I don't care for PvP aspects with these weapons aside from the splash damage also getting pushed to 110 cap alongside the main projectile.
---
&gt;I never denied that
---
you did but ok. I thought the sbq was overrated? its an easy fight and youre trying to tell me, another bloody build player, about how awesome bloody builds are. im saying *any* sneak build is good for a solo SBQ
---
thanks.
---
This Exactly.  The queen fights take much longer in area B.  I don't like it.
---
It is an issue that should be addressed one day but this is a what if jot a they have to do this post
---
Long Tongue Daddy Cummie
---
He is a wendigo that ambushed Freddy Woods on his way to his vault. He ate him and you can buy Freddy's bones and KidSecure ID bracelet from a vending machine
---
I didn‚Äôt buy anything from him. I tried to but he only asked for my furious explosive railway rifle and I said nope
---
Nice! I‚Äôm a day one casual player and I haven‚Äôt seen too many explosive weapons. I still stick with my furious 50 cal and heavy gunner perks. Although I finally found an explosive suppressor handmade I use for fun
---
i like the event, but i don‚Äôt do it anymore because it is difficult to do solo and no one does it anymore. i also don‚Äôt see many people doing radiation rumble
---
Happened to me there about 45 minutes ago.
---
Are you familiar with Canadian history in the fallout universe?
---
Hmm I'm not sure if your being earnest or not but I am sorry if my response came off douche y
---
yesterday i gave a level 15 player a handmade i picked up and 20 stims
---
I wonder if this has anything to do with the camp I saw with 7 vending machines
---
Mule doesn't equal duper. Or duped items. Lots of people have mules. Lots of people sell TSEs. Sometimes for super cheap. For the power gamer, TSE is not a wanted combo.
---
Sure, lots of TSE weapons were duped. But that was a long time ago and they've continued to drop. I've got at least that many TSEs on my mule, all legitimately earned.
---
No it doesnt.
---
Scrap. It is called Hardened Receiver
---
Go to the trading sub and ask
---
So you log in and stand around like an idiot on your alt while waiting for people to buy your shit? Kinda sounds dumb
---
It's the opposite, actually.  FO76 uses dynamic rendering to only render what the player can see, so building underground reduces stress on the server.  It does not visually render the players C.A.M.P until you're underground, and when you're underground it stops "detail rendering" the above ground.
---
I didn't even know people were selling shit on ebay until OP's post. 
---
Are people really paying ¬£80+ to purchase weapons? Wtaf that's more than the game itself ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Rip you just did the equivalent of ripping up a winning lottery ticket
---
I don‚Äôt think West Virginia celebrates Canada day. I grew up in Niagara Falls on the US side, I know how big Canada Day is! Would be neat to see some other celebrations in the game, I‚Äôm not the game lore specialist though üòÇ
---
Mine is sitting at 42 with 4 unyielding and 1 chameleon. No one has been able to berry mentat me. In fact, some have accused me of hacking because of it.
---
I launched a nuke there twice and had a server crash each time just when I crossed the airport from the train station. This was on a private server on PS4 several months ago. Haven‚Äôt tried since. Can someone confirm that this works now on my platform, please?
---
Soloing her won't count either
---
Yup, literally one of the first scenes you see in Fallout 1 is an power armored US Soldier executing a Canadian partisan in cold blood. Also if going by the lore The army's treatment of Canadians is the moment the American people start to realize that Something is very wrong.
---
They want you to waste time
---
LOL @ the serums for 1k each.
---
Yeah this happens, sometimes your ally will spawn somewhere where she then falls to the bottom of the mountain... occasionally I find her on the eastern side of the mountain after jumping off the mountain in my powersuit.
---
Plasma Caster would be my choice.  Any Heavy gun will translate into your build if you are melee.
---
So what? that lottery ticket had a permaban as a prize.
---
Do you have the both in your favorite wheel?
---
Unyielding.
---
Having DR that High is redundant because it gives a diminishing return.
---
When did I ever deny that? Can you bring me the comment I made? This is very awkward lol. You sure you are replying to the right guy? Think you got mixed up
---
Are you in first or 3rd person to do it? If in 3rd, aim slightly to the left of where you really think you should be. I've found the beams are actually much easier in 1st person, I'm just so used to playing in 3rd all the time I forget to switch.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Canada found the lore link
---
You're getting a bug. Quick swap is supposed to just switch between your last two used weapons, but it's been breaking lately. Sometimes just fast traveling can fix it, sometimes you might need to server hop.
---
Same
---
I get the same results with or without the favorited.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not alone here..
---
I would prefer a terminal like all the others with just line Name+item pricing and detail option. less stuff for Bethesda to fuck up lol.
---
Deleted since it was in your post, sorry.
---
Depends on incoming damage.
---
If scorched shoot you for 10 damage, having 65 DR reduces the damage almost as much as 650 DR
---
Who sells treasure maps for 49 caps?
---
It's about goddamn time somebody said that!! When you're in someone else's fort, you are a *guest,* and need to act like one. I put a lot of effort into my base. There's a sweet chillin' area for me and my homies with a TV, radio, magazines, and four kegs of beer; I even put in bunk beds in instead of my pretty princess castle bed, just so my bros have a place to crash. I don't like going around closing every damn door behind every person who comes over to buy shit, kick it, or whatever!
---
Yup. Third person. I‚Äôve tried in first as well
---
plenty of shit is "unbalanced" in PvP, teslas, cola spamming, fire rate weapons, stealth boys. the fact the legacies are OP is kind of moot. PvP just does not mesh well with vanilla adventure mode at all.
---
i really just think there are way more important things to do than worry about legacies over a year later, if they wanted to do something, they should have done it along time ago. 
---
if you HAVE to do something with them, i guess remove the explosive projectile and have the energy effects be a little larger and do invisible splash damage. call the effect "over charged" like the OC ammo from NW.
---
Pretty clever!
---
How do I get the marsupial mutation?
---
Niiiicccceeee
---
2 years more
---
It‚Äôs a vicious circle. Players don‚Äôt play it because nobody plays it. Obviously, if people showed up it would fix the problem. Hopefully events like this give larger SCORE rewards than the easy ones once Seasons launches, that should provide some incentive to show up.
---
Is the jet pack something you find plans for or just find in the game?
---
Oof when I'm on Xbox I've only played with people on the western half of the us
---
I launched one at whitesprings 2 days ago on a private server with no problems (apart from damn assaultrons in silo üòÇ)
---
Maybe a middle ground. The ‚ÄòRad Monkeys‚Äô are just Mirelurk models shrunk down to microscopic size.
---
I also don't think West Virginia has a cult that worships the mothman, nor has access lore wise to dozens of unique power armor designs. üòÇIt's just a little something for the canadian players of the game I think would be appreciated.
---
&gt;Ornate carved wooden stairs (1 year and a half, we've only seen metal stairs.. why Bethesda?)
---
&gt;Chesterfield leather couch/chair (this style https://www.pinterest.com/pin/414331234459511338/)
---
&gt;Beautiful Wooden Bookshelves with leather books in them (Maybe accompanied by trinkets)
---
&gt;Wooden Weapon Display/Plaques
---
Doubtful any of this would realistically survive 25 years of weather and nuke fallout.
---
&gt;Large stone fireplace
---
It's on its way to the atom shop.
---
&gt;Maybe a Chandelier
---
Could of earned this from nuclear winter, along with the ghilie suit.
---
Rad Monkeys? No. I‚Äôm joining the Cult of the Frog. Gib us an aquarium with Lord Frog
---
I love energy legacies, because it changes how the weapon works completely, and gives more variety to your arsenal. Think reg Flamer vs explosive Flamer, etc. 
---
Could they use a balance tweak or two? Absolutely. Will Bethesda do it properly and not break the game like the last time they tried to fix a legendary effect? Probably not
---
I‚Äôd be upset if they got removed though. There‚Äôs a large handful of the player base that actively built a market around these weapons and outright removal would upset quite a few players, me included
---
I'll give that a try. I used to think you just spawned somewhere random within the radius of your camp until I saw a player talk about moving it around to get players to spawn in front of their vending machines... but through trial and error I've not yet been able to get the spawn point to be a reasonably consistent location, or elimate spawning halfway down the mountain. It's likely to annoy players who fast travel to my camp only to fall off it.
---
Go into advanced display settings.
---
Change monitor refresh rate to 60HZ from 144Hz
---
Id love to see a unqiue projectile given for them
---
That's why the strategy isn't to keep all three alive. Just focus exclusively on one of the three areas, get the creature maxed, and keep it alive
---
you said that bloody sneak builds can do things that junky and AA and other sneak builds cant do, which is simply not true. I dont know why you said you had difficulty with the queen with guns other than bloody, but that shouldnt be the case if you are getting your sneak attacks in.
---
that you know of. i wouldnt know most were foreign if i didnt party invite during trading
---
"It's not *my* fault I'm an asshole, it's *your* fault for not stopping me from being a fucking prick! Lock up your shit."

---
It's beneath the Landview Lighthouse
---
Ok so I see people are getting super emotional about a what if since the subject matter went over your head I'll re explain it if you had a way to rebalance the weapons how and why would you again this is a what if not a hate post
---
I'll use et since i already googled it if i did it right it should be around 11-12am et when the down time begins i guess it takes around 2-4 hours (this is normally the downtime) i would suggest u check bethesda forums when the downtime begins since they make it longer than they said
---
This is a prank isnt it
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying. junkies stealth does good damage but it  just can't compete with bloodied sneak. Do I have to explain this?
---
That‚Äôs a hard one to get by scrapping I think. I think Raider Bot Vendors may sell them. One in Whitespring and one in Watoga and one near Dane‚Äôs compound middle north
---
The paints are designed to prevent you from scrip/scrap/dropping items. It's a P2W QOL
---
I gave a lvl 9 1000 10mm a gun and a full set of pocketed leathers should help him out
---
yeah no shit, thats why its so dumb to put a piece like that in a vendor.
---
its one thing to have hacked items, its another to to have them, and then do exceedingly dumb shit like this.
---
 I hardly ever go to it anymore for two reasons. 1) rng of the spawns to get a lv 3 friendly animal, this needs to be consistent and doable solo. 2)  the friendly animal itself, these things are crazy sometimes. One could say suicidal at times. These two major factors make the whole event too much based on chance for me to see them as viable for farming. Shame really, it's a challenge, and would be one of my favorites with some more stability.
---
Get a mic then go full roleplay, we pretend to be brotherhood or something and announce to players, halt citizen, you have been selected for whatever, just adds to the immersion for all involved
---
Here is a big ol' kiss
---
\*MWAH\*
---
Stack foundation blocks in the shape of a swastika to really get those BOS vibes
---
That's fair
---
Hooray!! TY
---
I'm not very creative, but my characters back stories are as follows...
---
My Heavy Gunner was a care free, slightly insane, friendly chick that was born and grew up in the Vault. Both of her parents died from a sickness that wasn't caught before they entered. After leaving she explored with some of her friends. Always the first into battle minigun or .50 cal blazing away. After some time went on her "friends" betrayed her, and she started to agree with the raiders that were in Appalachia at first. Rose became her best bud. She decided to join the Raiders again when they returned. They are a little soft for her taste, but time will tell if that's how it will stay.
---
My Sniper/Archer always believed money equals power. She was already inclined into taking what she wanted. Preferably with very little treat to herself, and ambushing unexpecting targets. Shortly after leaving the Vault, she encountered the Mothman. This rattled her brain and she became a devout follower. Though, her and the other cultist may worship the Mothman, she sees them as heretics. Fueled by nothing but destruction. She enjoys sending them to the Light with her flaming arrows.
---
My commando was a secret member of the Enclave before the Bombs. Now she is helping MODUS rebuild the might of the Enclave by playing both factions, yet ultimately, she's going to use the Raiders to meet her goals. Blood thirsty, crazy, bullet sponges.
---
My Shotgunner (oldest character) was a fresh rifleman recruit for the BoS, and was making plans to ship out west to join them...then the bombs fell. He wound loathing the other Vault dwellers and took off on his own as soon as the door opened. As time passed his eye sight started getting worse, and then he had one of them ripped out. Instead of giving up he started using shotguns instead of rifles. Just point and shoot.
---
My Gunslinger's (which I hardly ever play, and will probably delete) personality is modelled a lot off of Han Solo and Captain Malcolm Reynolds. He doesn't really have a back story. Grew up in the Vault. Loyal to those that are loyal to him, and just wants to make caps.
---
I sell it
---
I've never known a girl gamer that WANTS the community to know they are a girl. It creates ALOT of unwanted attention from people when you're just trying to enjoy a game, at least this has been the norm for any girl I have played with, there's alot of desperate guys online....
---
If you say so. If Beth cared these would be out of the game. But they aren't so that means they don't care.
---
it also depends on the day. Sometimes I have great stuff, but other times it all gets sold and I haven't found replacements
---
Right by the entrance of Flatwoods, close to the Wayward
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think anything will happen to them
---
Abandoned Big Town. Go behind the police station and there will be a wheel barrow with like 7-8 handcuffs. Also inside is 2-3.
---
I'd take a flag player icon.
---
PC crossplay shouldn‚Äôt be a thing until the hacks in PC are under control.
---
yes bloody has an edge, but since even a NON LEGENDARY is good enough to stomp the queen, whats your point? the difference is small, not huge like you keep claiming. the enemies available in this game are not tough enough for it to make a difference. you can solo the queen with a pipe pistol.
---
I run melee so 15 in Str, but like to use a handmade so have 9 in perception, concentrated fire and two commando cards maxed. Seems to work fine..
---
Why do that when you can make a useless reddit post for internet points
---
Probably not just discussing possibilities with people who can read where as some people are taking this as an attack
---
Bethesda does not ban players for having these items. If you see someone selling hacked weapons and armor, buy it. There is zero risk.
---
Oooo good idea, definitely sounds super reasonable!
---
So just to satisfy my own curiosity, you did break into a player's locked container, but for some reason the crime wasn't registered until some time later around the time you picked up an unrelated fan?
---
That‚Äôs fair, just sucks because most of my friends are on pc and I‚Äôm on XBox.
---
I've already met some really cool people since starting this, we just roll with each other now
---
TBH 12 hours without getting interaction isn‚Äôt that big of a deal. People in this game for the most part are pansies that flinch at the first sign of player interaction.
---
Old dev script resurfacing haha, that‚Äôs actually super crazy
---
You can upgrade many under armor, including the jumpsuit. It gives small protection and special buffs
---
Doesn't sound like it's the case but I've always had issues with it doing weird things if I have 2 of the same weapon types (for example an instigating combat shotgun and a bloodied combat shotgun) both in my inventory at the same time.  This also causes issues with my favorites wheel. One or both will just get removed from the wheel on their own.
---
It also loses track and doesn't know what to do if I use my camera at any point.  After using the camera it will just randomly pick a weapon for the second slot.
---
Wow that‚Äôs crazy! Old dev script resurfacing haha
---
plans, typically from SBQ battles, but they are so common i would not be suprised someone would sell one in their player vendor for cheap. but the cost to install one is a bit high.
---
Me and a couple buddies saw a level 1 coming out vault 76 for the first time so we decided to have a welcoming party for him. We crafted up some basic weapons, ammo, and some meds to help him start his journey. We emoted and took a picture together in front of the vault and sent him off on his new adventure. 10/10 most wholesome thing i've experienced in Fallout. Feels good to help out fellow wastelanders.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a trick or treater
---
Quite generous. good on you pal
---
I spend a lot of time chasing Low levels, they mostly seem to run away from +100 guy... I have a new solution called the overseer's cache... I cram a bunch of stuff in it and walk away when i see a lvl 1 in the vault.
---
hahaha.. it hasnt even started yet and i'm on level 98. youre such a noob.
---
[Well shiiii, good to know - thanks!](https://media3.giphy.com/media/83QtfwKWdmSEo/200.gif)
---
rank 101. its 1 louder than 100.
---
Welcome to reddit! Lol
---
Yes, I'm glad you guys took the time to help a new player to the game and glad that the community looks out for one another. Games more fun when player help one another rather then grief them
---
My vending machine near Vault 76 has all plans/recipes for one cap each. No matter how rare.  Collect so many from treasure maps, workshops and laying around. I just started selling mags and bobbleheads cheap.
---
Bet he was glad to get a helping hand.
---
The other week I went after a wanted player after misreading their level and thinking 'I can take this guy'. When I caught up with him I realised my error but decided to have a snipe at him anyway. Hit him and knocked off about half his health (he was clearly bloodied) but it caused him to start running around looking for me and gesturing for me to come closer.
---
I ran off thinking 'shit it's a trap, this guy is some kind of god-level ganker who will make me regret my hubris' giving my location away in the process\* and he ran after me for a good five minutes before it became clear he actually wanted me to kill him to get rid of his bounty.  
---
I planted some cryo-mines between myself and him thinking there was a chance I could still kill him as I ran and hid, and accidentally set them off killing myself (must have been a frog or something), sure he found that hilarious.
---
I should really stop excpecting alot from people then
---
dude shush that‚Äôs an elite secret
---
true, there are many variables involved..
---
me too. waiting for patch 20 and the seasons, will check that out, but actually enjoying playing somethign else for  a change.
---
at  one point they may have. i dont think the player base would be enough now
---
Nuking anywhere BUT the white springs or the SBQ is underrated.
---
The people that created and duped them didn‚Äôt even get banned lmao
---
Um I don‚Äôt mean to be a noob or anything (I‚Äôm level 60 on xbox) but I don‚Äôt know what does flux does can someone explain?
---
If you open up the xbox menu it's on the 2nd tab labeled people, between find someone and suggest friends.
---
Nice 
---
More players will get a use of your plans and maps rather than just siting in ur stash.
---
https://tenor.com/QwgG.gif
---
a lot of people barely talk in game, it may take some instigating on your end to strike up a conversation. some players do not even use Microphones, trying to play it more akin to a "normal" fallout game.
---
Yeah let's totally ignore that clip where a dude is one magging the queen out of existence. Btw, you can solo a queen with your fists if you try really hard. Bare fist is totally viable by your logic. 'Doable' and 'one magging' is different
---
Was your camp in whitesprings or some other place that is commonly nuked? Also, did you have vendors on (if you did not, that person might not have known that you had a camp there)
---
I would still rather get atoms than cosmetics.. to spend how I see fit
---
the only reward Im really looking forward to are perk card packs to sepnd on legendary perks..
---
not looking forward to all the people with max currencies making their angry threads when they get a currency award that doesnt register...
---
As a veteran and leaving out a lot of details (Nondisclosure Agreement)
---
Ain't no fucking way is anyone going to be able to launch an unauthorized nuke xD
---
And if someone made an authorized launch at us, it wouldn't make it. We'd 100% see it waayyy beforehand and take it out :)
---
Hope this helps :D
---
Wounding effect - give stacking bleed damage over time effect. Let it stack up to a specific maximum level so it's not a too OP. Change all legacies to this effect and allow it to drop on new energy weapons as well, but not on ballistic weapons since commando and heavy ones there don't need to get any stronger.
---
who doesnt check location when the warning goes out?
---
also a pre-emptive... dont afk with a base in a nukable area...
---
Im up at top right corner. I was eating dinner then I came back
---
so when you nuke an area, the flora turns into nuked flora. when you have a lot of it, plus other nuke zone materials (such as high radiation fluids, hardened mass, and glowing mass) you can craft ‚Äúpure flux.‚Äù Pure flux is used to craft high level armor mods prime receivers on guns (which deal more damage in general and bonus damage to scorched/SB) and also ultracite ammo to use with the prime receivers. there are 5 different types of flux too
---
Top right of the map with vending machines
---
I might just start dropping off my excess supplies at Vault 76, since it‚Äôs free to fast travel there.
---
thats on you for being AFK yo.. sorry
---
Maybe have one of the other vaults act as a hub... a group of vault dwellers who took one look at Appalachia and decided they were staying put but have allowed access to the vault to dwellers from other vaults for trading purposes.
---
I mean not really? Nobody nukes up at the top right in the mire
---
I was thinking regional match making too. I tend to run into Eastern and Central US players more than anywhere else, but early morning here, I've wound up on the same server as a few of my Aussie friends. That's at like 3-5 am US EST, though.
---
I like to keep a box full of low level gear at my camp that players can grab whenever they stop by. Ammo, food+water, stims, armor and guns. Easiest way to make friends haha
---
apparently at least one person does...
---
PC but thanks for the offer.
---
No shit . It's just a dick move. As said above
---
Ok, yeah, I just go normal quick pace speed but point myself slightly to the left. Everytime I go straight on I fall off the right side. At least with PS4 controller I have this issue with every beam or railing I've tried walking on, always have to be slightly left... it's so odd.
---
An oasis in the wasteland 
---
Sounds like a song title lol
---
no, it's just that terrorist cells have also used online games to communicate. You best believe a game about big brother and launching nukes that is openly watched by multiple governments.
---
Did you give a guy advice on where to drop a nuke? Cause I seen a guy nuke a players camp, right on it and the guy was afk so it obliterated it and killed him, so I message the guy and asked what did that guy do to you?, he replied that he gave me advice on where to drop my nuke. Thought that was kinda funny.
---
My camp is on the whitesprings fairway in a spot easily missable when nuking.  Those dicks always manage to squeeze my camp into the edge of the nuke zone, even if it means missing other important targets.  I put it there so that people farming nuked whitesprings would have free water, workbenches and stash boxes nearby.  I'll probably eventually move it just because it seems they would rather be funny than have nice things.
---
Well I have my camp top right of the mire at crashed vertibird. I was eating dinner and left it on so people could maybe buy my stuff in my machines. Came back me and my friends camp who is next to mine had been nuked
---
Omg she‚Äôs killing herself again guys what a legend
---
there are no rules for dropping nukes.. 
---
maybe they took offense at your vendor prices...?
---
You could always just take the some or all of  mods off.  Even non legendary base model flamers do pretty decent damage.
---
As a relatively new player (post-Wastelanders), I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised by how cool and welcoming other players have been. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs that feeling of knowing there‚Äôs something really cool going on that everyone shits on that ties us together.
---
I didn't scream. I gasped and said "this isn't fair." I mean come on! We went actually hunting for that damn thing and got zilch. Yet, here I am just minding my own business in a blast zone tryna kill things and get more raw violet flux when boom. There it is. You looked at the TV and got super excited and jumped up. Bahaha and plus, you never know when a vendor pops on and has the T-51b plans that we need. Gotta be prepared and have the crap I need to build it.
---
Yeah ik there's no rules but who would. And I see my prices very cheap. Stims for 5 each. Plans for lower than 10, good 3 star guns at a couple of thousand caps each
---
What if you are in the middle of a high level event when you get the warning?  Happens all the time to me, I'm not gonna abandon a queen fight to save my base.
---
That's weak, in the time it took you trype that I have ascended to level 100 of season 3
---
then you get nuked..
---
You might be on to something there friend haha
---
I dunno.. they must have had some reason
---
Or just have the light go off if it has no items.
---
Thanks I'll keep it in mind, I expected more single player oriented people but especially on pc I thought I'd get *something* interactionwise in 12 hours
---
Pah, I have just married Todd and am now level 1 bazillion of season quadrillion.
---
I personally think it was a really high level guy just feeling like he could do whatever he wanted and decided to nuke me and my friends camp. I lost a pet deathclaw
---
I just bought the game a few weeks ago and I was walking up to the settler city and a guy who was level 400ish started shooting me so I ran away. He chased me down and then got on the mic and started saying, "Its ok little buddy, you don't have to be scared. I cant hurt you. Its ok." and then he dropped me a shit ton of supplies. For reference irl, I'm 6'2 300lbs and 40 years old. I thought it was funny, but i did really appreciate the supply drop.
---
Jokes on you, Todd did the old double cross. He's been cheating on you with me for months.
---
Must confess i never played a commando build. Does it work out? Only a 10mm (smg, right?) sounds quite hard. Just came back from westtek (first time ever inside) and although i knew there would be muties and try to kit acordingly (sniper outside, fixer inside) it was tough.
---
Was poking fun at the poster trying too hard.
---
Add me alphaboomer
---
I‚Äôll lend a hand
---
That wasn‚Äôt me you where cheating on, I only met him 5 minutes ago
---
Thanks, I was intending to play mostly solo but expected a bit more banter. You figure mmo's in general are meant to be grindy and the social interaction is the fun part but to each their own, I will keep trying to interact it just freaks me out thinking I might \*never\* get to interact with players
---
Wear broken armor with the buffs you need. Zero DR and still have WWR
---
Time moves slower for a mere mortal like yourself. Todd has given me the powers of the gods.
---
could be.. 
---
I would suggest not going AFK when you cant check nuke locations going forward...
---
GL
---
Yeah and bolstering gives you dr. Not much of a choice imo.
---
Those type of events that take massive teamwork to get a possible high tier reward are not worth the effort if there are not enough players participating.  I have just gotten into the habit of ignoring them because I got tired of standing around only to end up alone and likely failing or getting shit rewards.  Also, many of the high level players that could complete these events have already gotten the 1 or 2 top tier possiblilities and have no motivation to do the event further.  You just waste healing items and ammo for not much.  If Bethesda was smart, they would just add in a few new plans, items, etc as a reward each month or two and the events would stay fresh.
---
Ok you win, this is too much of a grind for me.
---
I get what you're saying but what I mean is...if a ghoul has 100 hp does it really matter if a Junkie build is hitting it for 1000 damage and the Explosive Lasers are hitting for 1500?  You're well past the point of, "overkill" in either case.  
---
If PvP was more active or if PvE had a stronger focus on endgame content that's intended to be challenging, I'd understand.  As it is, it's kinda silly to drop the hammer on explosives and leave all the other ridiculous shit untouched (not that I want to see anything else get nerfed/removed).
---
Now that's a victory Royale
---
I found a berserker 25%ffr 15%reload Fixer for 1000 caps in a player vendor and build an alt around it. I'm stealth commando using broken chinese stealth suit (broken armor don't give DR, but will still provide with the legendary effects). If anything, the combination and power you have is OP. Berserker is the same 50% increased damage as junkies and few others.
---
Scrapping bulk junk works as well.  Although you cannot craft bulk screws yourself I'm pretty sure you can buy them from robot vendors.
---
So just fyi, if the challenge is to scrap something like springs.... Just be lazy, bulk the ones from your stash and then break them back down.  Boom, challenge complete.  The weekly challenges for gathering 5 building materials can be completed in about 1 minute doing this.  It's an easy workaround for those challenges.....which aren't going to be a thing anymore in a couple of days anyways lol.
---
Either use a marsupial mutation serum (not too difficult to find player vendors selling them for 500 caps or less) or drown yourself in a bunch of rads and hope that it will be one of the first few mutations you get.
---
It would be neat if they added a Mexico mini bundle
---
Also because of recent dupes many high levels now have all the rewards thus making this event pointless
---
Normally no, but since the game generates a value for the attack it can cause errors like it did back in the day where players would stop dealing damage, because the game will retain the values for each shot and with enough you can cause some serious issues in certain locations of the map
---
That would ruin player interaction
---
Heck yeah, bear time! Thank you!
---
f76 needs basic things like a fucking in game chat
---
I've only ever jumped in on it when I saw it active on my map, but once you finish it, there's a named NPC outside of the tunnel that you can talk to and he has an option to start the quest.  Not sure how it works however, because I cancelled the dialogue choice since I had *just* completed the event.
---
That‚Äôs more akin to what I‚Äôd expect. I have a (non PA) helmet that adds 1dr and that basically the best I‚Äôve seen for headwear so far (barring the legendary radical masks).
---
I meant nothing by it! Just excited to see some changes and always improve.
---
No one said forcing. He implied hopping between high level camps hoping they give you stuff which scummy 
---
Don‚Äôt look for a handout
---
A level 20 asked me about my backpack and I explained to him how I got it. I made him a crossbow so he‚Äôd be much more ready :) saw him 2 days later with the backpack!
---
Oh cool
---
Haha I did that on xbox a few days ago, and I made them turrets.
---
A choice Military type helmet of any type with a working light would be nice. I hate the Pit Boy glow and the Miner and Hard Hats have a decent light but look a bit rubbish and out of place with most outfits and armour.
---
My handmade makes a sound every time I load into a new area.  It sounds like the flipping letters signage thing near Watoga, but it never stops unless I holster my gun.
---
This.  Zero.  Just don't sell on ebay or hoard a million quantums.
---
I been leaving the Vault 76 with resistant lining at the Overseer  cache  as it raises INT by 2 and will help a newbie in getting EXP.
---
I don't suspect these are going anywhere.
---
They just won't contribute Atoms, but SCORE instead.
---
Besides some of the unexplained things in the game, they have always stuck pretty close with the lore. I also agreed that it should be included! Oh and I don‚Äôt remember which fallout it was but one of the old special weapons had a maple leaf on it. They definitely need to add a bunch of things.
---
I still think that clip is using the bobblehead stacking glitch from the godmode glitch. hes in a team and drops the sbq out of the sky.
---
Link worked. Wow. This is more of genealogic research. I think he will be an army styled commando then. Never played commando myself. Guess he's gonna wear army fatigues, combat helmet, using factory guns and prefer frag grenades over improvised nades.
---
Have you tried the metal hat? I use one on my raider.
---
Build a floor in between the two walls and then figure out a way to attach a stair to the rest of your structure. It looks like you goofed th build order by building above a roof.
---
You might one day get a Flag for your Camp, or at least I'm holding out for a set of 'flags of the world' bundles, but the US/Canadian Fallout Lore would make it a little awkward to go full on.
---
I currently run an Instigating Explosive Pipe Revolver Rifle with my steath Rifleman/Gunslinger combo. Double dipping!
---
 I have an Instigating Gause as well and yeah it does hit hard.
---
 I actually collect instigating rifles and pistols,  more specifically IE ones.  I have every single rifle and pistol IE collected including a few heavies and Legacies.
---
 There is something about the pipe revolver rifle that I keep coming back to though.  I have A-blast with it. For a secondary weapon I keep an Anti Armor Explosive Handmade for faster fire if needed.
---
Great idea! They can just reuse the terminal to do it
---
I been nuked 3 times in a month.... Its my vendor prices they are high... but its premium shit... So i get nuked but i make a shit load of caps... So its the price you pay for doin business in the wasteland...
---
LOL.. As a holder of quite a few of these plans, I'd still be so happy if Bethesda just deleted them.  I am sick of those plans clogging up every vending machine.  Personally I don't sell them anymore.  I probably should just drop them in the world and let them go poof.
---
He hoppeth with Glory, he will smite the non believers.
---
I honestly love this idea. When fortnite was first announced and this was it's core I was excited, but I quickly lost interest, just like I did for NW, but this sounds nice
---
Thank you so much for the assist on this! üòÅ
---
Keep in mind that capturing workshop will flag you for pvp while in the workshop. So other players may come and kill you.
---
Preach it brother.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I didn't even think of crafting treated under armors and putting them in places!!!! Good idea
---
I have some left over from the event too. Been debating on taking them to my private server and dropping them. 
---
At first, when I needed to cap sink, I was buying all of them I could find and taking them to my private server, but now if I hover over a camp and it has 100+ plans I just skip that camp. No caps for them. Though, I'm pretty sure they gifts maxed them out.
---
Go to your favorites wheel and look at the bottom to see which key binding it is.

Marsupial Serum or radiation to get the marsupial mutation

I am a die-hard Chinese communist. North Korea is cool too. I learned the hard way how the US government and their capitalist puppet masters bled America dry burning through their resources and their ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù workers. What happened next was always inevitable, their insatiable and unsustainable greed led to war and invasion. Eventually, America attacked China destroying the greatest nation in the history of world. Today, I work to rebuild New China in the ruins of Appalachia and hope you can join me. Any and all capitalists will be quartered. I won‚Äôt have them poison our colony this time. United we stand, divided we fall.
---
You can find me at the CCP embassy to the east of Whitesprings. If you find an embassy, to the west, you are at the wrong location. We are working on becoming missile capable again.
---
Open your favorite wheel and look at the bottom of the screen. On xbox it's Y.
---
newer players ive noticed tend to avoid talking on the Mic, those who are more comfy with the game (higher levels) tend to have less to do so are a bit more open to chit chat.
---
Reminds me of the time i fixed a workshop after it had just been destroyed, fixed and then destroyed again. I later went to a silo but someone had just run it
---
Hey can‚Äôt save perk points.  He has to spend the 25th point to see the 26th, if you follow me.
---
Goodness me, there it is! Thank you!
---
There‚Äôs literally one source just by the outpost to the south east. That‚Äôs it
---
Yeah. It's a burden we must carry üòî

This totally worked - thank you! üòä

That's what I'm really worried will be the case.

Ohhh okay, thank you

That cowboy clothing Raul had in New Vegas would be nice to have.

You bet!
---
A lot of negative stigma based on when it was bugged in the past. Personally I always show up because Habitat C is super easy and most people that show up don't know that that Habitat is functioning properly with radkelp spawns now.
---
Can't find it.
---
I checked yesterday and it‚Äôs still bugged. 6/27/2020
---
if your vending machine prices are so horrid, your selection so awful, your machines so hard to find you should expect someone to get a stick up their bum and go nuke happy. it is what happens when you give people "easy" access to weapons of mass destruction
---
[Smite the non believers!](https://youtu.be/nRB8Jor8tPs)

Ppl are using weapons with glitched effects suck as stalkers ffr or junkies ffr on a weapon with over 200 fire rate. The code fucks up and acts like the queen is a normal scorchbeast resulting in very fast kills
---
I should be doing this on my communist character. Tell them that I'm with the Appalachian Workers' Party and that the Party assists all new evacuees from the Vault 76 disaster in order to spread the growth of a uniquely Appalachian communism.
---
Imo my vending machines are fine. Have lights and signs to show you where to go. I have hard to find plans. Good prices. But this is all just imo
---
And the Speed Demon mutation. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
They'll sell you both the dirty and clean versions if they ever add them, but I don't see that happening. Players have been asking for clutter packs since like day one and I have yet to see them gain any traction.
---
The only issue with it is if a low level player is doing quests there. You launch a nuke, and then they have to switch servers... if they even realize that it‚Äôs a big deal.
---
Not kidding but by names i also end up a lot with the same folks on PS servers.
---
Either it‚Äôs a time or region thing but i‚Äòm fine knowing my neighbors even we aren‚Äôt befriended.
---
You don't need to stack bobbleheads. Ballistic bock, small guns bobblehead, 15% flat damage increase or 30% crit damage with magazines, 20% crit with food, 25% or 15% was it? from psychos or overdrive, revenant, I don't think I named all stackable bonuses  but look at all the buffs you can stack. That's not even counting adrenaline. You still think that damage is using a godmode?
---
I'm so fairly low level (60)but when i see a new player i usually drop 15-30 purified water and some chems
---
Came here to say this. Saving them is only usefully after lever 50 so you re arrange and make big changes with saved perk points. For lower levels your locking yourself out of progression
---
No doubt. I would rather buy a generic pack like this  than spend atoms on a theme I don't care for though. Probably the same for most folks too.
---
then it may have been someone who also had their camp there, but instead of changing servers they decided to make the obstruction go boom.
---
Thank you . I‚Äôve never understood this and I‚Äôm level 230 .
---
It took me a ridiculously long time for me to figure that one out myself. I felt like an idiot when I did.
---
Definitely craft lvl 5 or 1 if possible with super duper and scrap it with scrapper and full unyielding for high into if possible.
---
I started to test it and it fascinates me, my 10mm is explosive bloodied and does quite a bit of damage to any enemy, before it was melee and I lost advantage against distant enemies
---
Heavy weapons builds because of stabilised perk.
---
Themed builds - people who care more about "rule of cool" than meta builds.
---
Lazy QoL - you can fall off cliffs, dont take limb damage, can breathe underwater, dont get enviromental diseases, dont need to wear something different for nukezones, dont need to mess around with radshield. Sure its not meta, but its great if you're a casual.
---
There's a lot of stuff littering the wasteland that would be great for cluttering camps...except the display options are very limited (essentially just the display cabinets). How I would love more standalone and placable small items beyond the few plushies, lamps etc
---
Just use Fallout 76 Quick Configuration mod from nexus. Its a separate executable, and it can merge and manage your mods without any problems. Just define your fallout 76 directory, select steam/bethesda and you are golden. Cheers
---
Texas! :P And yes you're going to be sorted based on your play time (obviously) and your ping.
---
I've always been interested in FO76, but the PvP aspect of the game always bothered me. Personally, I'm not a fan of PvP games, unless I buy it specifically to play (IE; Battlefield 4/5 etc.). To play a game where my hours or days of gathering and building can be wiped out, or my stash of crap can be raided leaving me nothing or homeless, does not sound like something I want to spend money on.
---
So, not knowing a lot about FO76, is the horrible scenario I described, actually a thing? Is it something I have to constantly worry about?
---
 I'm thinking of buying the game during the Steam sale, but I have my reservations. Any info and replies will be helpful!
---
 I've watched some streaming today, and it looks fun as hell, but I just really don't want the PvP portion to ruin my game experience.
---
I was hoping you were linking me a Bread Boys reference, but Charlie the Unicorn is pretty good to.
---
Thats the idea
---
I said it elsewhere [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/heesxc/is_it_a_dick_move_to_kill_bosses_with_op_weapons/fvqr8s3/) if interested, but basically if you're not the one doing the nuke run  then don't be a nozzle and let it be a spectale/event the way it fucking should be. 
---
It's fine if you wanna power farm events with freinds etc, sure people mooch off it but still, if you're insta killing stuff you're still getting more reward than everyone else for your efforts, and time is the factor for oyu, not the event really.
---
But rocking up and not even waiting the literal minutes it takes people to get her to mutate before you blow her innards out her arsehole instantly is not really the way to be. 
---
A lotta people are still experiencing that event with wide eyes, some even at levels in the hundreds are doing it for the first time still.
---
Don't be that guy, especially when you have the capabilites to farm the event all you like solo if you wanted.
---
Wish you were on XBox...I have 10.
---
Hard rip
---
There are multiple random encounters with manikins some witha body some next to the messenger, gotta say it's a spook
---
Seriously?  After Fasnacht I had more legendaries than I could carry and had to mule some over to my merchant. I‚Äôm still turning in junk legendaries for scrip. And I ended up with a hell of a lot of Two Shot weapons. 
---
Add in the year and a half of play and it‚Äôs well within reason that someone has moved some over to mules.
---
That vaporizing thing is why i stopped using energy weapons. And i loved them. Saw too many legendary enemies and Queen itself be disintegrated into nothingness. Workaround would be to change weapons before killing an enemy, but for me that was too much on an hassle. I just went for ballictic weapons.
---
Yup totally new...

Nah, but i‚Äòm with you - have my up.
---
Maybe we see it someday the same for some other things suggested since long time - player hub etc.
---
If your gonna play sniper get yourself a lever action as a back up. Or buy a fixer from someone if you don‚Äôt have the plans. Those two guns are top tier for snipers. my instigating lever action puts everything down in one or two shots. 
---
Your gauss rifle is a good gun. Just watch out using it in vats. The gauss weapons suffer from a bug that has a chance to make charged up shots miss in vats. When i use gauss weapons in vats I don‚Äôt bother ever charging it and it has better accuracy. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f275ec&amp;d=sg0pd2pk2pp2pl2p02ej1c72cu2ic4a72an2ar2ao0a30a02lt2l10lv2lu2l71&amp;m=1c5f
---
This is more or less the vats sniper build i use. There‚Äôs probably betters out there but i can one or two hit most everything except the queen and wendigo colossus. Which those fights I do pretty decent damage i just prefer a support role. I get more enjoyment keeping people in the fight rather then being a boss killer.
---
Overpowered weapons and builds from other players are why I wish instanced events were a thing.
---
Bloodied is +80% max iirc, Junkies is limited to +50%. Mutations however are not described as 'per mutation' but rather as simple +10% which make it a far less effective choice.
---
Yep.
---
obviously both factions would have to "opt-in" and if you wanted to stay wat from pvp dont join one or join one without hostility...
---
So is it Bethesda's doing then not the fault of players, if that really is the case I'll keep running silos as I'm starting to enjoy them.
---
I'm a very late starter to the silo game but it quite entertaining.
---
Wait a minute. Vault teachers told us China surprisingly attacked first which led to the Battle of Anchorage... They lied on us, again!
---
Will come by for some political lessons if i see your camp, brother!
---
yeah i thought about that to
---
Are you asking if a particular gatling laser is good, like a legendary one? Or just asking about all gatlinga lasers?
---
And either way you do not have to worry about vaporizing the SBQ. Dont think its possible anymore, but even if it is I haven't seen it happen ever.
---
I completely approve those ideas. Another idea that someone mentioned previously is the option of pre-furnished objects. For example: Bookshelf containing books (that way it does not take up budget space to include every object) or a preset dinner table (with plates, utensils, and drinks).
---
Bloodied is max 95% (at 100% you would die), as the damage increases every 5% health lost by 5%. The reason people talk about 80% is because that is the nerd rage starting point and everyone wants to stay just below 20% health.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they did. They did it with duped items last year. Armor, weapons, aid, etc, so it's completely possible for them to "search" each players inventory and remove stuff.
---
This!
---
Ok. I guess a good TSE is a solid reason to leave a beaten path. But still, a smg only one sounds exotic. Have fun!
---
If you‚Äôre going to be away for an extended period of time why didn‚Äôt you just exit to the main menu?  You can‚Äôt blame other people for your stupid decision.
---
No it's not, in 2 years this was my first experience followed by a few more. All the other thing you mention can't really happen. I think that's the way it was I'm survival, but not in the main game. If you lose pvp you lose your junk and 50 caps but nothing major. Just don't keep seeking revenge and they can't hurt you or take anything of value.  Things like this are so rare that I had to post about the increased frequency because I just shocked me, 95% of players help set you up so it balances faaaarrrr to the side of amazing community with a few jerks. Basically like real life . Worth it though, pull the trigger if you like fallout and then add me up!
---
it is strange. it never happens to me when i do FT again. Maybe it works for newer camps but basically after a while u never find urself burried this way bcz the game spawns u outside the camp area. Just my experience.
---
Oh Bread Boys. Forgot about that channel. ü§£
---
I agree with you, if they can do that to the SBQ on their own why not just glitch through a silo, I bet they do that as well and farm away.
---
My characters are reaching 130 and 270 but just never even tried launching nukes until this last week. I read some complaints about this insta kill thing, but to have it happen just after you grind through a silo with no glitches and a few deaths is demoralizing.
---
R53600 @4.1 and a 5700XT on a LG 65" 4K 120 HZ and I have zero problems keeping well above 60

mines a grave stone, I picked it because it sticks up above the grass
---
It's still the players abusing known defects for their pleasure.
---
Fellow filthy casual solo as well, made it to lvl 67 (all side quests including wastelanders content). Just did Mission: Countdown/I am become death myself for the first time yesterday. I won't be able to log on today but a quick plug for the level 3 hacker perk: turning turrets on the robot foes, especially for the launch sequence, was clutch. Don't get me wrong I still had to take on the odd Mr. Gutsy and Protectron but the only enemy that worried me was one leveled-up Assaultron.
---
Good luck!!
---
All great ideas!!
---
Everything below refresh rate is crap
---
shablagoobuddy, be on in half an hour if you're still needing the assist.
---
Yep!!
---
1 cap
---
Appreciate the quick response. I'll definitely do both!
---
Well I wasn't the one who nuked my camp? It's not a stupid decision to keep my vending machines open. For caps? Hmm maybe it was the dickhead who nuked my camp for some unknow reason
---
I don't like to use more than one weapon because I can carry little weight
---
 Is buying the Fallout 76: Wastelanders Deluxe Edition worth the extra cash, or should I just buy the basic version?
---
Yeah I get why people do it but at least stick to doing it on your own runs if you really must abuse it, it‚Äôs costing you nothing if someone else does the work to just let others enjoy it. 
---
I don‚Äôt see the appeal really. I wanted one of these weapons for ages, when I finally got a couple I tested it once in private world on the queen then never used it again. I‚Äôd rather use the Gatling laser I have and make it a bit of a spectacle, as it‚Äôs still fun for me even after doing it loads of times to actually have people come together for an event and it actually BE an event without everything getting one shotted.
---
Yeah I get that completely. I've done deals before where people catch me at my camp and ask for a bulk deal, a guy bought 900 5mm, and asked if he could get 900 for free and I was like, I make it 1100 for free because you bought other things too
---
I was more so pointing out that theres something wrong with your rig if I'm averaging 50+ more frames with a lesser CPU and similar GPU
---
Random spawn location right there. It‚Äôs a  popular place for trying to spawn the traveling vendor bot.
---
I just wear a full Secret Service set for my bloody Gauss pistol build
---
IS THAT HERESY?!
---
After the game first launched there were lots of this going on.. But eventually all the people who enjoyed harrassing others either quit the game or changed their ways, and the ones that remained were mostly friendly fallout universe loving gamers. When wastelanders launched lots of those players returned, and alot of fresh players came. So we are experiencing the masses of asses again.
---
That's what you get for not buying an Atom Shop skin for your outfit
---
Yeah imagine being level 3 again and wishing you had a few bits of aluminum. Bingo! You head to the overseer's camp and someone has put plans, aluminum, ammo and an outfit in there. suddenly your day got a lot better eh ; )
---
At the expense of others, but I guess... they have no idea if I may be rocking one of those to so? I use my 1\* bloodied handmade at SBQ event so have to take some time to get enough damage.
---
I 2nd this. Same for Dead By Daylight - we're getting xplay later this year &amp; I am absolutely (as a console player) dreading this. I know there are those few on PC that hack &amp; just ruin it for everyone. ü•∫
---
The most time i have 120+ fps, but as i say: everything below refresh rate is laggy in my eyes. In foundation eg the fps drops as fuck.
---
My rig is perfectly fine: metro exodus runs on ultra with 250+ fps and looks fantastic
---
Believe it or not, some people don't like cheating at games.
---
it also sucks that the arena goes back to "normal" after the quest is over and done with. it just has the scorched running around again
---
I's on the road leading to Vault 96.
---
Listen to the Holotapes left behind by the overseer, hear how her ‚Äúleaders‚Äù fed her lies throughout the years. It nearly destroyed her. This is just another small example.
---
while that is the case, they're paying for more than just atoms
---
It‚Äôs not like there are other worlds to join /s.  Your CAMP getting destroyed is on you.  You chose to go AFK.  Quit bitching and moaning because of your negligence.
---
Well i know what I'll be doing later tonight after i finish binging Dark S3
---
the entire game is multiplayer,  its more or less a open world "mmo."  do quests, do events, run around an explore, grind items, kill bosses.
---
the entire game is multiplayer. but it has two game modes currently.
---
Adventure mode - you are there in a server and other people are there, you do things, they do things. you may bump into another player, you may not. it just depends
---
Nuclear Winter - a Battle Royal game mode.. eh
---
Ooh ok.
---
I call mine the Mysterious Vendor because no one can ever find the entrance to my base.
---
I don't typically use vats, something about actually aiming down the scope is good for me. And I do have the fixer plans and I have an Anti armor lever rifle too
---
Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo.
---
Better luck on the next try fellow dweller.
---
Normally I would 100% agree but the more damage I do, the less fuel I have to craft
---
Which is a big deal to me haha
---
Somebody did this for me when I was a low level. I STILL don't have the plans for a fusion generator at lvl 70. 
---
But now I'm too afraid to accept random invites .
---
You play in a world with others, that's what they call "multiplayer". You can group up with other, or not, just as you like.
---
But that does not mean you can play offline. If you want single player, you need to pay for F1st...
---
You got "just works"ed.
---
Have to agree, I launched the nuke, how hard would it be to code a guaranteed reward of some kind.
---
This last nuke I launched I came away with 4 acid, everything else except that one Angler was vaporized in seconds or less. And then everyone was gone leaving me there in slight shock on top of the bunker üò•
---
I'm also one of those that will go out of my way to track down low lvl players &amp; unload food, chems, water &amp; 1 melee, 2 guns (coz not sure of their build) but most of the time it turns out they're 2nd, 3rd, 4th characters that were muels &amp; already have stacks of stuff. Alas, I still try. Also, I'll invite to a team &amp; help them build a camp if they want as I have a generous amount of basic building components thanks to that Fallout 1st Scrap Box. üëç
---
I'm so happy that you guys are able to have this good fortune to have these others that come by and help you out and give you stuff. Me not at all. I've never had anybody give me stuff, help me out or anything. The only thing I've ever gotten was grieved. That is the reason when fo1st came out I got it and have been playing on it ever since. Don't get me wrong, I'm genuinely happy for everyone that gets helped and think the ones that do the helping out are great people, I'm just jealous. I'm a family man and the only time I get to play is after the kiddos go to bed. So I don't have much time to play and I don't want to spend time dealing with people that want to make my game a living hell. I have 3 characters and my highest is only level 54, then 15 and a 10. Anyways, good luck to all and may the wastes treat you well.
---
Please stop commenting, you are making everyone have a headache.
---
People are bored.
---
No excuse, but maybe a explanation.
---
It can be hard to judge where the spot will be. My last 2 bases during the build stage the travel spot was beside the vendor the whole time. Finish and they usually just spawn in the floor or at the back of a building. My new place causes you to spawn inside a bridge. But thankfully you can walk out of it
---
Ya know, as anti commie as I am, that's a great roleplay XD
---
These are purchased from eBay I presume or traded on the other place, I've never traded to be honest, the idea makes me feel nervous
---
Add me on PS4 I'd you want to grind out the PvP trophies. cyanide_fairy87
---
I'll be home in about half hour. I need them and the swimming badge, ha.
---
There's a trophy to kill someone?!
---
Its overly long and complex for what you get. I ignore it 100% of the time.
---
I'm French Canadian and I disagree with this. It's an American thing. Let it be this way.
---
Next thing will be European wanting special reconnaissance. Then Africa. Then Australia...
---
Just no.
---
I think it's because on the 30th the patch is removing the ability for people to initiate PvP via teams--these bored douchebags won't be able to trick people into PvP, destroy your camp with a team, or just be a pain in the ass to anyone who isn't willing anymore, so they're having fun while they can. I'm looking forward to the change so much.
---
I used to try the broken armor thing but it's too much hassle to repair and break it again as clothing and armor are switched around. Now I run around naked but with a backpack. It's not so bad, but I do have to pay more attention to inventory management. 
---
Berserker is a lot of fun to play.
---
Would be nice if they were just decorations you could plave yourself. They don't even have to be functional wires. But a fuse box and some self placed wires/pipes would look nice.
---
They‚Äôre not THAT hard to get if you know what causes it, the main thing for me was getting it on a good heavy weapon. I ended up with an LMG one and a mini gun. Was kinda funny to be the arbiter of justice that one time on her in private, but meh I don‚Äôt get the long term appeal honestly, and maybe that‚Äôs why I am seeing more and more in vendors.
---
I only get this when the last used weapon was the camera. It goes to my "most used" weapon in my inventory. 
---
I was thinking maybe they disabled the camera from being a "last used weapon" since it isn't a weapon.
---
Remember if you get marsupial you'll need the cars starched genes other wise the next time you sip a disease cure it will be a very expensive mistake!
---
I couldn't do that course either. Or the one at charlestown, drove me mad! Ended up getting a friend to do it for me..
---
I do that, and drop them a Sweet Tato Stew (our indoctrination stew) and a Prisoner Collar along with any extra Gasmasks, Miner's Hats or outfits I have on me.
---
When they turned off selling option I did it regualary. But the main reason was to have more space in my inventory.  The place was the Overseer¬¥s camp or personal delivery if there was any 5 to 25lvl arround.
---
I can spare one,whats your ign?
---
Maybe you didn‚Äôt read my post properly. I was going through their vendors when they did it.
---
Not all heroes wear capes. But vault suits.
---
Yes everything is easier with a Mic including not ruining the immersion by messaging .. $22 gets a headset with a switch for he mic .. if you chatecter is not in tune with your voice, no one cares that matters üôÇ
---
That's a  very nice sofa. Imagine tho you get home from a hard day of killing ghouls, kick off your dirty clothes and stretch out on that thing, you'd have to *peel* yourself off it

AWOL armaments, project paradise, uranium fever and radiation rumble are the best

Track your mods using [this awesome spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311). You'll find the hardened eventually. Personally I wouldn't craft pipe weapons for the mods since enemies drop loads of them (save your components for handmades and lever actions), but you do you.
---
I like when they melt it in seconds, but only after a while, and specially when they wait for it, even after SBQ mutates. Its a delicate dance, because the longer it takes, more critters and scorched spawn around and it can become quite messy so undergeared folks are just wasting their ammo and aid stuff... ( question what are they doing there in the first place is other matter, but imho irrelevant for rest of geared folks ). Perfect runs in general are logistical nightmare on public, true, but as mechanism in that particular fight should be quite obvious and simple after first time participating, it shouldn't be difficult to do for the benefit of everyone.
---
When I first started the gane I saw him all the time. Only to find out later he is a bit of a rare spawn... And now that I am looking for him, he's nowhere to be seen... Typical.
---
Since right after launch I started giving things to players lower than I.
---
To start with it was for stash space, with the side note of helping someone. Mostly the space, though.
---
Now, if I'm in the mood, and have screws (fuckin screws üòí) I'll make newer players deep pocketed gear, fully modded weapons, resistant marine/officer under armor, and maybe an Assualtron/Sentry bot/Marine tactical helmet. Also ammo for whatever weapon I was giving away. If I have any legendaries for their level I'll drop those too after modding them.
---
If I find one building a camp I'll drop off some plans, depending if I have any on me at the time, and materials, but most of my camp plans are on my vendors for 25 caps a piece. I do tend to have to cap sink often so I'll go buy plans like thebfusiin generator, and advanced power connectors and drop those off too.

I lived in Vegas when New Vegas came out.

Nothing about it reminded me of the real place.

bcz it goes pretty fast, u know?

Riding shotgun as well

regions also seem to have a hand in this.

i seem to come across 2 guys pretty often if i play at night from home but if i stay at my sisters place in germany for 2-4 weeks i don't come across them anymore

Weird it‚Äôs never even shown up on the map - Will have to see if I‚Äôve turned off notifications or something.

Didn't play that DLC but a Fallout Zoo would be great in 76.

I'm telling Todd.
---
Mission terminal works with power armor to go underground.
---
AWOL armements is great, i'm surprised to be alone every time i do this event
---
Yes thinking on all servers. Not just the one I am on.
---
Interesting to read, never knew about these glitched/bugged weapons or whatever they are called. Just a game I supposeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I often drop some plans and stuff for low levels but my all time favorite and funniest encounter was as alcohol crafting dropped with Wild Appalachia and FT to flatwoods to pick some tarberries.
---
Was right next to the church as i saw a lvl &lt;10 running away from a level &gt;100 in Full PA and hearing the latter yelling over area chat ‚Äûlet me help you!!‚Äú.
---
That poor soul.
---
Thanks for your reply, but I just logged out. Do you have time in 24 hours or so?
---
I sold few for 50 caps each and I felt very sorry for the player who bought them. Now I drop it in my shoping area and almost no one is interested. Another "good" reward is mininuke and missiles.
---
Indeed it is buddy, there‚Äôs always next time üòÄ
---
They don't care about other players I guess if they could rain in the damage a bit, it just seems selfish.
---
as a new player 1 of 4 things will happen
---
\-people will let you have fun/leave you alone
---
\-people will try to grief you (mostly if you take over a workshop, or do not turn on pacifist mode)
---
\-people will give you care packages
---
\-people will offer assistance in many ways, not just with items
---
That is useful, thank you!
---
i mean if you think about it a fully modded flamer being the same weight as a default flamer is still pretty neat.
---
Just tried it I got mine to 48 and berry mentats were still spotting me, probably something else going on there.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Have you done line in the sand? At Allegheny Asylum? It's that minus the building, waves of scorched and a couple of SBs
---
There was a zoo, that had Gatorclaws (you guessed it, Deathclaws w Gator heads) and that was like..it. You had to help this guy raised by apes named Cito clear them out and thats that. 
---
Better yet, an Enclave zoo featuring FEV monstrosities.
---
It‚Äôs Tell0
---
If your on Xbox, I‚Äôd be glad to help you out!
---
Happens ferry is better overall and gives 300-400 violet. Among 100 or so of the rest
---
I usually respawn very close to where I died at Variant B. That plus the larger farming area makes it my preferred nuke location. The gullies that people mention are avoidable if people pull the fight to the south side of FS Delta.
---
‚ÄûHey... hey you! Yes you!! Come here...
---
Wanna see my instigating fat man??‚Äú
---
Same lol
---
Ward just says I see you have our missing property, and it's over before it starts, and I haven't gotten rep from Foundation, Crater, or Ohio River Adventures in Days. Not sure what the deal is here.
---
Its seems these glitched bases are 50/50 whether its a trap going underground with punji boards for me.  I usually drop my junk in my stash and then check the camp out.
---
PC
---
it doesn‚Äôt have nearly as much enemies though does it?
---
If you want a one star max level junkie's handmade I can give it to you for free then.
---
Tons, they respawm as well. And the super mutants are 60
---
I actually haven't done that one yet lol
---
I don't know how many times I've stood outside the vault with the confetti emote waiting for new players inside.
---
I have stood there many minutes without them coming out. It's heartbreaking
---
I 99% sure that he must be lvl 20 for that.
---
I was low level when Fasnacht was going on so I had to get rid of everything after like a month. I got an instigating explosive LMG
---
FAX YO
---
I might not miss them, but I sure as hell will miss the atoms...
---
It gives low levels a chance to do her log quest before meeting her in person.
---
ok ill do a friend request
---
It's annoying for sure, when asshats act like that, I agree. It's actually sad if some of those aren't kids, though, as I believe you shouldn't be adult and crave for attention like a kid does. What I suggest is, keep track of player profile, switch server and move on. Nothing hurts more that absence of attention for anyone craving it.
---
No junking remains around 25% lower at 10 addictions than bloodied at 20% life, assuming you also runs junkies at low life for Nerd Rage and Unyeilding bonus range.
---
But junkie is an affixe that is bugged and makes your shotgun doing insane damages in VATS, in addition to the weapon would normally do.
---
Yeah there‚Äôs at least one guaranteed spawn halfway through.
---
I just checked, it can't be displayed.
---
If you were on PC I'd say join me in an epic "put all kinds of cool shit in the overseer's chest" quest. 
---
 I have so many cool things to put in there. That's my endgame.
---
that was awesome; hope you make more
---
I tend to drop stuff for noobs out side vault 76 stuff I've made for low level usually ammo gun and armour set helps to keep the alive a few more minutes
---
Workshops are a massive waste of time. If you need a resource look up farming routes. I used to do them for lead, then i discovered lucky hole mine plus extractor armor. I got 1200 lead scrap in under 30 minutes with super duper and a buttload of acid.
---
I have keycards and codes ready to go. Add me on ps4: scribehaylen I‚Äôll be down in a bit to do a nuke run I‚Äôve done it solo a few times but have been wanting to go at it on a team üòÅ
---
Ok thanks I'll just forget it
---
Where possible I like to utilise the numerous pictures, Posters, wall mounted lights, conduits, curtains and others to liven up what many others leave as just plain canvases. It takes a while though as many are locked behind rare plans or atoms. What's most annoying though is you can put in lots of work then a wallpaper change deletes them all...grr aarrgghh!
---
It's a bit hard to find people to team up with right now, but starting on the 30th we're getting a system called public teams which should make it easier, we'll be able to see a public team on the map, see their chosen activity, and join them, or create our own
---
they are on the map when active arent they?
---
Shablagoobuddy, I'm about to jump on
---
Wait what
---
I will look into that thanks, but honestly i enjoy building on the workshops and the defend missions give some xp and rewards too
---
Easily. I'm furloughed right now, so have nowhere else to go lmao
---
Hello friend! I sent you a DM with some info.
---
Yeah, I brought my friend to the overseer and it says he has to get to level 20 first.
---
They are. Sometimes if you load into a world it'll show events that are supposed to be happening, but some actually aren't. Sometimes when you TP to them the event has already ended so it would be nice to have a progress bar or something
---
It only deletes stuff when you first add wallpaper, not when you change it. I always make a point of papering new walls with the first optoion as soon as I build them then worry about the proper choice later.
---
While I completely agree with you I would have loved a repeatable arena there, but I think the reason is that that particular location is a quest destination. They probably didn't want to change it permanently and would screw up the quest associated with it. I got the Cop a Squatter quest there more than once.
---
&gt;keep track of player profile, switch server and move on
---
Didn't think to note such, I'll just keep tying and hope I get some fun, it should be fun otherwise why bother tbh.
---
lol you have a computer and play on a controller.. wow
---
Beserkers needs to be 100% max, being full health and no armor rating is balanced imo.
---
Very nice! I like it, and always am amazed how builders work around some limitations, like using suitcases. How's the budged, though? As quite a noob on a subject, can't make past 2 floors, couple turrets, work benches, some displays and few crops without hitting that "flamingo limit".
---
I'm on PS4 and I give them out for free. Diffusers to everyone!!! If you are on PS4 drop your psn name
---
I went through the wayward questline and found cranes treasure. The Duchess mentioned she had picked up the signal for the overseer and that's how I got it...
---
I need a new sugar daddy on the Xbox no homo uWu
---
5k is max you can have, so spend it.
---
6k caps says that the Brotherhood will probably have stuff once they‚Äôre in the game.
---
You mean the bottom right of the map is a bad spot for my base?!! /s
---
I'm down, I'm run nuke silos a few times. PSN: xx_glichekid_xx
---
Ft to Charleston train station and run toward the bridge. When you reach the fallen phone pole on the bridge turn around and head to the barn. There are several fun random encounters that spawn in there.
---
Haha know the feeling. The Netherlands is already starting up so I have to work. I will add you tomorrow.
---
I tend to do party chat vs in game chat because I've found in game chat is buggy as hell. Either it wont work, people sound really low, or I can't hear over the in game noises.
---
lol
---
If I know I'm going afk for more than 10 min, I just go to the main menu lol someone must have seen your prices and didnt like them.
---
I bought the game in steam and got a steamid as username in game. I got rid of that by creating a Bethesda account and link the steam game under it. Next time I logged in it changed to my Bethesda name.
---
I do not know what mail you are sending. I did none.
---
Yeah probably. I'm more annoyed cos the amount of materials it cost
---
Cool. See you then!
---
Yeah, I meant Free Range.
---
I found a level 2 at the overseers camp the other day. While I was waiting for them to come out of the work bench I set my controller on the couch and it hit the fire button. I accidentally shot them even though I had pacifist on and with them being too low level to do any damage it must have scared them because they ran off and wouldn't stop running.
---
Oh that wouks be nice. Or to make it more fallout, you can have an exotic collector who asks you to capture the animals for him. Then you can have different factions like poachers and animal activists. Make it more interesting.
---
Ok! I'm going to try this!
---
As a canadian, I would love to place some canada flags and base stuff at my c.a.m.p. even a canada style backpack would be neat.
---
Also the building across from the police station. Get to the top accessible floor, then marsupial/jet pack up through the hole in the elevator ceiling to reach another floor stacked with fans and typewriters
---
It‚Äôs kind of a pain in the arse.
---
Both turrets and crops take up quite a lot of budget, as do displays. I refuse to use turrets because they're pretty weak in addition to taking up massive budget, and an ally protects the camp better than a turret does anyway.
---
we kind of do, though they are atom shop skins for Nuka Dark and Nukashine
---
Sure üëç. Fun should be centre of non e-sport games, I agree.
---
Yo whenever I get back from this trip can I buy 2 off you?
---
I usually leave like 5-8 3* legendaries inside the cash register because I ain't about adding all that extra weight in my storage lol
---
Also, this doesnt work when the daily specify: scrap screws from *junk*. Only the weekly quest you mention can be done with this technique
---
Hmm, i tried twice is that a zero or an O?
---
Yeah but they cost atoms, and what if you wanted to save up for something else. It would give people the chance to earn a power armor skin for free.
---
I think this IS creative. Honestly my character &amp; playstyle goes back to FO4, so it took me hundreds of hours to find out how i could quench the most enjoyment out of the game for me. And you came up with 4 developed backstories. And a gunslinger ;-)
---
Ack. My poor phone. The things its seen. 
---
/creates hidden img folder
---
They honestly might add a new currency just for them
---
Just a word of warning enemies also spawn there. They're all low level(3-5) so if you're on a new character it could be a bit of a challenge but otherwise it's a lot of cute spawns. I got a Mister Handy vet leading a bunch of cats there a few times but it's really really rare.
---
This is great!
---
I'm on ps4  willing to give it a go level 111if we can start a give it a go list uk
---
You sure that last sentence is correct? I have a Junkies FFR minigun with +fr barrel because I wanted to see it in action and it just does crazy health drain to anything. Killed a max level behemoth in about 20 bullets which is nothing for the minigun.
---
I have tried it on the queen, but only after she had mutated and been fought for like 10 minutes. It melts her for sure, but nothing like it insta-kills everything else.
---
Thankfully it should soon be moot, I heard it's fixed in the upcoming patch.
---
Smithy_bmx message me anytime I‚Äôm on
---
Well then it was "worth it"
---
Theres lots of holotape games all of which appear at random so you would need to find a farming path for magazines.
---
I don't use mics at all and keep other players mic volume set at 0.
---
 PS4 here as well. I sure wish they would add some kind of text chat so I could communicate with other players though.
---
 So to me this game is pretty much a solo player game as it is.
---
Invite sent
---
I've lost an item (BE gatling gun) using loot bags, but never with world containers.  Would not use loot bags.  Bag was still there, just could not access contents.
---
So a vending Wendigo? I'm out of ideas here... Melee only, deathclaw hand and mask?
---
Yeah i learn that in a video by oxhorn, on the daguerre questline you must go on valley galeria and he made a video [valley galeria by oxhorn](https://youtu.be/tUsLcW6Gmsg)
---
Are you on a team?
---
Heard it for turrets. Quite annoyed for displays, though. I like to browse what players display on those, and it can be quite entertaining on some brilliant minds. Shame Crops also hog resources, as it can help much on food and drink management.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me before I got the lvl I am now today and now if someone needs help with a horde or needs some ammo I‚Äôll give some to them so they can progress in the game
---
Am I the only one that had mixed feelings about receiving high level gear when I was new? I mean a huge part of the game is looting and building that stuff yourself. I said thanks but honestly I was torn about even using it.
---
I did pass that jumpsuit on when I got up higher . Thanks again. :)
---
I thought they were coming out with some under armor mods. Hopefully some ultralight mods for limbs as well but haven‚Äôt heard that
---
That is very likely they want to keep up daily activities.
---
I agree, im not interested in any of the armor or power armor on one of my characters so I'm starting to accumulated a lot of gold.
---
Yeah, I have a bugged weapon I specifically save for that case. If they're having trouble killing her and it's 10-15 minutes in sorta thing with everyone wasting ammo. Otherwise I just blow through my JFFR .50 cal because it's ammo is easy and I'd rather everyone get the tag.
---
Wouldn't be an issue if she landed / crippled correctly. They say bugged weapons are fixed on the PTS but I'm willing to bet they didn't fix the queen...
---
Keep the nozzle mod and ditch the tank to cut the weight down a little. It's already a situational prefix so you aren't doing more damage to every enemy.
---
I had a flamer I crafted and modded just for doing the set the world on fire challenge when it would come up.  Every few weeks when I got it out I was like "oh my god, this thing is awesome!! Why am I not using it???".
---
Then I would notice how fast it was burning through fuel and remember why lol.  I know where you are coming from.  I actually scrapped the thing yesterday since I shouldn't see that challenge again (I hope at least)
---
I play VATS as the shotguns are bugged to benefit greatly from it. I never remember to use Criticals. I studied Angry Turtles Gauss Shotgun video to make sure that mine has the right weapon mods to reduce AP usage, but yeah I'm always running out of AP.
---
I do always have Sunshine Oil (+400AP) on hand if things get really stick. Also, it it helps I just rolled a Quad version (32 shots) right might ease reloading.
---
If memory serves someone calculated that daily maximum Treasure Notes and Gold Bullion will last for plan buying for around 40 weeks. We are about 10 weeks in to Wastelanders so if they are serious about the top end currency the reintroduction of BOS would be a logical starting point for extras lengthening the list with each patch/season.
---
WOW I wish I had this blueprint! My dream camp!
---
Im dumb please explain this glitch with limb damage
---
Nope, have never even teamed up. I went to my social tab just to double check, nothing there.
---
There's a cap to movement speed which speed demon mutation alone is enough to reach
---
Are you using speed demon? there's a cap on movement speed.
---
While banking and gambling would be pretty cool to see implemented, it would probably be a nightmare to code into the game without making super bugs. Investment opportunites though sound like they may be more doable, and I personally would love to become a caravan master. That would make for some really great endgame content.
---
If you have speed demon mutation you are already capped at max movement speed bonus you can get.
---
It shouldn't delete things when changing...'shouldn't'. Believe me it only needs to happen once to be annoying!
---
I don‚Äôt know if I want to know.
---
The scrip no longer drops. Bethesda removed it from the drop pool after the massive dupes.
---
Also Marigold pavilion has a random faction encounter that you can reliably farm. Hitting the two of them and server hoping builds rep.
---
PM‚Äôd
---
Commenting to check back on this idea later (I think it‚Äôs a good event idea)
---
I had to keep following up on my bethesda ticket until they reset the quest for character. Worked fine the second time.
---
Sneak speed does increase but as has been noted if you already have speed demon then your at max already. It's not a huge amount in either case but I did feel the increase made movement seem smoother.
---
Well that sums it upüòÖ
---
Same thing happened to me! I have set up C.A.M.P. in the savage divide on a beautiful lake and randomly I saw two mannequins  standing on rocks about 60m from my camp. Thought nothing of it. Continued on with my life in the wasteland. The next day I come to my home to find FOUR mannequins standing 20m from my door!! Although one of them was hanging back. (Pretty sure he's the leader) fast forward to the next day I spawn and these creep asses are IN MY HOUSE! Three of them standing at my armor bench! The fourth (leader as I've come to call them) is still standing in the same spot watching. I flip out delete my C.A.M.P. (I was overdue for a remodel anyhow) and .50 cal the mannequins into my lake lobbing grenades in there with them for good measure.  With my C.A.M.P. removed I was able to find a foot locker with a note titled "all gone" and it read: "
---
You're all gone.
---
You left us... left us to rot, left us to soak up the radiation and die.
---
You're sleeping soundly in your¬†vaults, drinking gin and eating¬†Fancy Lad Cakes.
---
One day, you'll find these things. These are the people you let die out here.
---
We hope you emerge to a hell worse than the one they died in - the one we will all die in soon enoughüò±üò±üò±
---
Needless to say I am convinced that I am haunted and now constantly carry table salt.
---
On CBox?
---
Yee
---
Maybe, as that would be easy for them to do I suppose as they have them all now...
---
I just recently got speed demon lol thanks
---
Gotcha ty!
---
Look up fed76
---
I'm just curious as to how you didn't manage to hit her enough to get credit? Unless she was literally 1 shot, there is still a decent amount of time to dish out some damage to her. If youre able to solo a silo quickly with little efforts then it should be even easier to apply the damage needed to get credit for loot after she goes down. 
---
I'm not saying what happened was okay, but its odd that you didn't have time to put some damage on her yourself. You get a full 2 minutes before the nuke even touches down and she spawns to prepare for her arrival.
---
You've put into words exactly what I have been thinking !
---
There will come a day when we are no longer able to lounge by the pool in white springs or admire the breathtaking views from top of the world. One day all that beauty will be deleted, and we'll never be able to wander through watoga and rest in a favourite book book in the high school.
---
I'd pay alot of money for a totally offline version of this game, even though it would be very lonely.
---
I keep going back and remembering how much noise they made about this mode and now it‚Äôs a fucking joke among BR.
---
Thanks a lot ü§£
---
Pretty sure it affects the Barrows too. So many nuked ghouls.
---
Its great if you need cobalt, queen for violet and crimson, Whitesprings for yellowcake and fluorescent
---
Well they shouldn't but i
---
Calm down there satan
---
Well thank you!
---
Playing 4 is my longest time spent on a FO or ES game, right near 3k hours. 76 is "quickly" catching up at 2.2k hours so far. Getting a little burned out, but hopefully the seasons thing they are supposed, I think, to add Tuesday with rekindle my interest. But thanks to mods and quest "tampering" I learned how to come up with my own stories. 
---
It really helped me with 76 a lot. I'm just glad I stuck with the game. The way it's growing, kind of like it's "alive", going through changes, it's helped me get the RP aspect of it more. Not having story driven NPCs, Rose and Modus excluded, forced me to come up with something different. 
---
If/when I delete my gunslinger, I'm debating on doing a character that's not from 76 or 51. Kind of like Samuel, possibly even the "faction" that I assume he's with. I'll just have to gloss over leaving the Vault. Lol.
---
Seems like a bug then. That‚Äôs the notice all instanced interiors give when you try and enter while on a team.
---
Mutants doesn't stack.
---
It really should, though.
---
I have 4 vendors full of stuff. Literally 120 different kinds of things. My caps fluctuate from hundreds to thousands to 10s of thousands on an average 3 day period. I suspect I'm not a rare bird in this aspect. If you expect me (and others) to cancel and repost 120 listings regularly for your convenience you're high. I won't take a loss just to be considerate, it is the wasteland after all.
---
Thank you very much! The budged is at maximum ü§∑üòÅ  and I'm able to build camps like that, because I'm not using any defences/turrets.
---
I wonder if they will do any more with the technical data and the BOS
---
There was a datamined pictures floating around about wastelanders before it launched. And in those pictures there  were models of disciples armor pieces atleast. So they are coming... When? Who knows.
---
The gorillas were cool too, though. That game was gold.
---
I might be wrong here but I think if you just move your camp it blueprints the whole thing and restores it to fully repaired once you plonk it down again.
---
I think there are only two rules for this. 1) The items need to be competely destroyed. Damaged doesn't count. 2) The decon arch always has to be rebuilt using flux.
---
One mans garbage can also be another mans treasure.
---
Oh wow. That'll help a lot in the future. Thanks!
---
I like to leave plans, ammo and assorted weapons in a container mostly in areas where I know new players frequent. Flatwoods (church) and isolated cabin mostly where the responders are for players to stumble upon. 
---
I also sell helpful plans for 1 cap each. üòÅ
---
Have no idea but I wouldn't worry about that repair armor perk since my goal would be to not get hit ever if I'm sneaking around on that armor
---
Feel free to add me at any time too, artori_denkirii
---
I don't remember when the perk is available but to keep with the character and lore she would have to take it early.
---
Damn I didn't even know that existed! It says the lowest is 15000 so if anyone thinks it won't be sold let me know
---
Afaik you need all three animals active and alive to receive the rewards that are actually worth attempting the event for (diffuser and bear arms+mods).
---
I don‚Äôt even do it to keep the community helpful, I just enjoy seeing new players spam emotes when I drop loads of goodies for them
---
Good idea. Would work great if we had a central hub for players to hang out. They could add a slot for each person on the server in a market area of the hub.
---
Why? Virtually everyone seems to shun grenade launchers. and dump all ammo. I had one at about L5-10 and it was fun. Useless after that. Two-shot would make it useless AND inaccurate.
---
It does. I have no idea how Morgantown got hype.
---
you may know this, but jet pack is an attachment for SS chest, so good to get chest first and work on getting good chest rolls while you then save up more gold for jet pack
---
A fallout 76 version of Diamond City ü§£
---
I've done this event whit all three animals alive with just three people, one for each biome. "A whole server" is a stretch.
---
There are so many bugged weaps right now and the chads are just eating it up. It gets really annoying.....they really gotta get these weap bugs fixed and while theyre at it, just do a full on rebalance of all weaps, nothing should ever be THAT powerful, bugs or no. sbq should be atleast sorta challenging.
---
That‚Äôs amazing lol!
---
I personally think seasons are a good idea and can't wait for it to start. 
---
I never once even looked at my daily challenges unless it was for my scout badges.
---
That's just me though.
---
If you have an extra one left ill trade for it.
---
No. Just no.
---
used for mutation serums and radiation showers too
---
I usually just do it myself, free 3star legendary boss at the end
---
Why? Just why?
---
Yes, magic weapons are not the ones one-shoting queens. People stacking damage effects via godmode on console or using hacked weapons on PC are the ones to blame for that.
---
Harper's Ferry - Violet  
---
Morgantown - Cobalt  
---
Whitesprings - Flourescent, Yellowcake  
---
Bog area near queen - Crimson, some Violet.
---
What about a vendor hub in general that would connect you to all stores from a central location? Maybe not even a store but a way to browse and then if you see something you want, you can see what CAMP it‚Äôs at.
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons) here is the full listing of each reward, there are multiple instances of 150, not just one
---
LUL But they take the Radicals Mask away...
---
I mean anything that negates me going to a camp that has 50 weapons and they are all paddleballs.
---
There's almost no cobalt around Harper's.
---
Ultracite .45 requires cobalt. The Fixer uses .45 ammo - so there's your answer.
---
Yea I'm not happy about losing my daily challenges
---
Magic weapons don't one-shot the queen, even the Gauss Shotguns can't do it. What does it is stacking damaging effects like bobleheads and Psycho via the godmode exploit or using hacked weapons on PC.
---
I remember seeing on for the first time and was like WHAT IS THIS VOODOO
---
Same.
---
That would work! Could even make it so you have to load into the city. Might cut down on server issues.
---
its worth a lot to someone who wants a bugged weapon, to limb dmg is bugged currently and it keeps stacking dmg, the lmg is insane already in terms of dps and a bugged one is arguably the highest damaging weapon in the game. I have one but I barely use it, ammo coasts is not great and when you use it on the queen you screw a lot of people out of getting loot.
---
Yea lucky break does work with it
---
So you have to kill enemies while wearing zero armor when you enter a nuke zone or how do you stay alive in a nuked areaif the enemies respawn and youbhave to wear a hazmat suit?
---
I thought this was a request for an in game traveling band named the Rad-Monkeys... like that other real band.
---
You can get 5-10
---
Cobalt at Harpers with super duper
---
That reminds me - Monangah is about to join the list of frequent nuke targets because of the "Collosal Problem" event.  I presume it's going to be mostly a Yellowcake hive cause of all the Blackberries turning into Blastberries, but anyone know off hand what else is up there?
---
True. I had an LMG already and that thing shredded. Most of the reason why I'm asking what I should price it at
---
I take empty workshops every single time i log (pc). Not ONCE has anyone ever pvpd or even ninjad them from me (i dont build any defences, just take them for the events/plans/bored). The one time someone did do something they simply just walked up and asked if he could take it...but yea dont bother taking shops for resources just grab em for the event/plans
---
Couple days ago I was also breaking the mainframe cores and and the game crashed to the dashboard. Not sure what the hell happened..
---
not exactly sure what you are saying. but i wear piper armor which gives me a lot of rad resistance. but yes, you might have to wear a hazmat suit so you don‚Äôt take a lot of radiation if you do not have power armor. And once all of the enemies are killed, just leave for about 30 minutes or so then come back and they should respawn
---
Yeah, if they upped the amount of scorched times 5 and allowed building, that would do the trick, what we have now is simply not bombastic enough
---
Dude, Morgantown has enough raw flux for 30 BEFORE getting Super Duper involved.
---
Magic weapons are not doing it OP. The people one-shoting the Queen are either using exploits to repeatedly stack damaging effects from drugs, magazines and bobleheads or using hacked weapons. They know fully well they're going to one-shot her and are massive cheating cunts.
---
When I would find power armor suits I can‚Äôt use, or ammo that nobody will buy I would just head to Vault 76 and drop it off for level 1‚Äôs to pick up and use. It‚Äôs become a bit of a habit by this point so that ever little bit is used and can benefit someone.
---
Or seeing 200+ plans for them to all be mounted heads :-)
---
But almost nothing else, dude.
---
You can get 40-60 violet, 5-15 cobalt, 5-15 yellow cake , 10-20 crimson, and 20-30 of other.  From a single run. 
---
Plus you can easily get all the other materials you need in harpers, which you may not get in Morgan town.
---
I avoid it, just like the Encrypted event, because people either don't know the mechanics of the event or think you don't have to do them.
---
Radiation Rumble is turning out the same way it seems, which sucks. It, Riding Shotgun, and the Queen are the only events that I'm aware of that reliably reward Treasury Notes. Even doing every event (excluding Project Paradise and Encrypted) that pops up, I've rarely reached maxed notes since the parade ended on one character. And I'm trying to get bars for three currently.  üòÖüò¢üò≠üí©‚ò†
---
I hardly ever see Riding Shotgun going on, and when I try to start it, most of the time, it's on cool down. I wish there was a timer to tell us how long until it's ready.
---
The Trapper armor already makes little sense
---
I wouldn't even do the event if they upped the scorched waves, it's already a huge ammo sink
---
they're taking away something that they give us free and giving us other things free. 
---
Sitting on 4000 atoms right meow as there's nothing i want.
---
This lol
---
There‚Äôs a very straightforward way to get the plans, but I don‚Äôt want to spoil it for you if you‚Äôre the sort of person who avoids wikis and that sort of thing
---
Get a bloodied DCG with melee build. Kill it in 10

Swings.  Easily one landing if a friend helps with a cryolator.

Not need to take so long I‚Äôm them.

This will make me sound old, but there was a time when huge open world's had loading areas. We yearned for open world's to walk from one place to another without the dreaded loading screens. And now people volunteer to have them. I'm so confused.

Given how in the lore Canada becomes American property any Canadian related content is technically Americana. What do you mean by European special reconnaissance? Unless you're thinking of something specific it would no doubt have been in some American museum or private collection, since modern uniforms have very little to no difference in appearance. Africa? I'm pretty sure if they did that, that would be like adding an SS uniform into the atom shop if you know what I'm saying. Australia, I wouldn't mind those hats, they added the Fez, so why not, also the road leathers in the game is literally a direct reference to Mad Max.
---
There are thousands of low level characters that have above thousand pounds of legendary items on them.
---
One of most expensive armors are level 1 weapon weigh reduction armors. There are hundreds of low level mules that have full weight reduction set and have on them dozens of thousands of pounds of legendary items.
---
What you've seen is nothing special :p
---
Im a bit of a chatty cathy myself...yea it isnt very often people even acknowledge your existance let alone talk at all. I think once you hit the 200s+ people mostly ignore you, its the newbies/lowbies who get the love, thats who im lookin for when im bored and have an asston of stuff i gotta get rid of
---
Yes even tho everyone will reply and say no. It was good from the start too - Just not what a lot of people wanted from the Fallout franchise.
---
Thanks for the response! I think this answers my poorly worded question. Do you know if a Chinese stealth suit is sufficient rad protection to enter? I'm L42 so i would love to check out a nuke zone but would only last without armor if i can sneak around.
---
I don't need anything else to be honest. My main toon is around 300. I use Flourescent for .308 ultracit and Cobalt for .45 ultracite.  So I alternate between whitesprings and Morgantown.
---
Also, when I drop the nuke I use a private server and focus on the ghouls while the zone is active, pulling down the flux afterward using all the characters I have across 2 accounts. So I can typically pull 1000 raw flux / 100 finished of the type I'm after.
---
you'll feel different about it when you're higher level and you've done every event 50 times or more.
---
Sounds like you aren‚Äôt playing enough lol
---
Unless you have fallout 1st then you get a special box that is for junk only and will scrap it all for you
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, some Brahmin don‚Äôt let you milk them. When they kick at you it‚Äôs an unsuccessful attempt at milking, either server hop or find another Brahmin. I had to server hop at least 5 times to get this one done
---
In my experience, distance usually mitigates the damage.
---
Do u got to sneak on them to milk or just walk up
---
I use Morgantown, a lot i learned about it when I was playing with nuking different areas lol
---
I'd like to give it try again, but I had to replace the hard drive in my xbox. Apparently if you own the physical copy, and lose the disc you can't download from the xbox store. I won't pay for the game again.
---
Then we need a hard mode for those who don't waste ammo ;)
---
Well recently, I let a friends borrow the game and he lost it so I bought a new copy digital, and I hoped back on it so it‚Äôs been maybe, roughly 2 or 3 months but I don‚Äôt really stay at my camp that much to even notice or even craft anything for that matter lol.
---
418 on my main here with two accounts as well.
---
Damn if you‚Äôre missing out then if farming two accounts at harpers.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt farm flux anymore since the dupe, too easy to trade for/have tons anyways. 
---
I was a flux salesman before I took a break.
---
One day I will get this
---
It's alright. I was just expanding on your comment.
---
A couple effects give you an infinitely stacking damage bonus so long as you consistently hit shots in quick succession. It's basically applying the fallout 4 furious effect on top of everything else you have. It's limb damage, vats accuracy, junkie's, medic's, faster fire rate, and I think one or two other effects that cause it
---
Lol if u had a video of that I would watch it over and over.
---
Another benefit over hazmat suit. Can wear a backpack. Especially an  high armor one. Save your repair kits from events. Easier than looking for those mats.
---
I just got the backpack plan last week and finally have the full set.....its my favorite swag so far. I usually just drop off any extras i get to random lowbies around the map....
---
A lot of people reported that it had a huge amount of technical problems, though. Core gameplay didn't seem bad, but that was about it?
---
I bought a bloody gatling laser 1 star, and mine does the same damage as yours, 1k caps at a vendor.  The gernade launchers are about worthless, unless you enjoy using it.
---
No lol, it‚Äôs just random. Some will let you milk and some won‚Äôt. But if you server hop at the wayward or somewhere with Brahmin they‚Äôll let you eventually. Sometimes you can milk all 3 and sometimes none, when they kick at you it didn‚Äôt work
---
It's an estimator.  Don't take it 100% face value.  You could maybe try trading it or getting price checks on it elsewhere (like discord channels)
---
A feeling of pride and accomplishment
---
It‚Äôs a zero
---
someone nuked Monangah awhile ago and i didn‚Äôt know about Colossal Problem at the time. anyways, i looked around and i can‚Äôt remember exactly what i found, but barely any mobs or flux
---
I don't use an Xbox, but this doesn't seem like a new issue to me. On a PS4 if you lose the disc for a physical game that you bought, you have to pay to redownload it digitally.
---
it‚Äôs a great nuking spot. definitely top 3
---
It would be considered a huge unfair advantage because frankly it is. 
---
I support the vendor hub idea. There isn't that many people per lobby so setting aside a space for 20 or so vendors shouldn't be a big deal although it would suck not going around and seeing some of these amazing camps. 
---
Until then just set up your vendor in high trafficked areas so you get those "since I'm here..." People. 
---
Or do like I did and put yours around vault 76 so people don't have to pay.
---
Did my first nuke solo the other day but would love to do it in a team so anyone who is willing to do a team Jaffa_jizz
---
I have been preparing for this day, I have an army of frogs I can sacrifice to His Grace.
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.  I *can* kill her in 8 SECONDS. That's from the time she spawned, she flew out - I plinked her once with the fixer, she landed immediately on top of me and she died to a single LMG clip directly to the face.  8 SECONDS - I don't think you can even swing a Death claw gauntlet - even a faster swing speed one with Martial artist behind it, 10 times in  8 seconds - let alone swing and hit the target.
---
Are you in area chat in voice settings?
---
I recently bought one of those "magic" weapons for super cheap at a random vendor just to see what all the fuss was about and uhhh yea.....that shit has to get fixed real quick...bloodied gatling laser is great but ur better off just saving up for a good gauss minigun roll, magic or not that thing shreds
---
i was just about to comment that the chinese stealth suit does give you 1000 rad resistance. just as much as a hazmat suit. but only 150 damage resistance or so. same for energy
---
^agree
---
Ah, but now you‚Äôre talking about a bug! I‚Äôm sure they will fix that.
---
Also video? That would be a world record outside of the old assaultron head glitch!!!
---
My camp is basically in the encrypted event zone so sometimes when I‚Äôm away from my controller I come back and have finished the event.
---
Yeah that's a fair point I just thought because it would appeal to more people for Fallout 1st because something needs to warrant me and a lot of other people paying for a tent and a scrap box. Dont get me wrong both good features but not really worth what the price is! I like the idea of a hub it's a lot better of a suggestion tbf!
---
Idk I played on Xbox from day one and never had any issues personally. Whenever servers would come down Bethesda always stated why and an ETA for when they‚Äôd be back up. They‚Äôve added things in and adjusted gameplay and content based on feedback from the players. What more could you ask for as a gamer? The ONLY issue that annoyed me was when player vending was down for a bit due to duping because it took them longer to figure out the fix. But even that (player vending) is an added feature that we got because of player feedback.
---
That gun I think is currently bugged til Tuesday. But I kinda want to try one of those out? What system you on?
---
never heard of that happening before. i would try again
---
Oh man yeah probably!
---
Really? I purchased the physical copy of red dead 2, fallout 4 goty and Diablo 3. Those 3 i just went to the store and downloaded. I thought it was odd, but I guess it is what it is.
---
I am ready for a change of pace.  Almost 20k atoms saved. It takes me 5-10 minutes to do dailies and 1-2 hours for weekly.
---
I don't see the point in trap camps either, and will gladly waste a few thousand rounds destroying their little punji boards, but.....
---
I found this one trap camp on that really tall mountain near the Devil's Backbone, and I loved it. 
---
When you walked up to their machines you got flung really far off. They had the spring loaded trap hidden under some rugs, and it launched you. 
---
After dying the first time and verbally exclaim "holy shit!", I got in my PA and kept repair the traps just to get flung again...
---
Actually, I was level 60-something (I used to play on ps4), but I started playing on pc from scratch, it does not make me feel any better I will eventually get to a higher level, or that I can do it effortless on my other account. I just wanted to do the event at my own peace. If they weren't gonna help, why did they have to walk in last minute? It's just rude as can be.
---
Thanks folks !
---
I'm a sneak build anyway :)
---
Free fast travel to the World Event marker
---
Thank you for the warning! That sounds so awesome!
---
well then there you go. i used the chinese stealth suit for a very long time before i turned into a heavy power armor build. really good simple suit
---
üôÑ
---
You think such a severe downtrend is platform-specific, and that there is no underlying cause? Okay..
---
Why would you want to get rid of such a priceless creature? If I remember correctly, the scorched variants are basically immortal.
---
That's perfectly okay, you just got there after all. What bothers me a little is people that come at the very beginning and watch you do everything and don't even bother to kill enemies. 
---
Still, that's somewhat still ok. As long as you don't bother I don't mind helping low levels get events done. Just... Don't finnish it when I'm trying to complete it... It's rude, even more after all the time it took me, it wasn't a five minutes event.
---
And subbed! Thank you for the info
---
Ok I‚Äôll try add u
---
Just expensive to build and maintain lol. I'm sure PA is the dame in that regard.
---
fair enough
---
Haha how much does it suck having no friends? üòÖ
---
Not on ps4 but if your lookin to build one/blueprint one, dolly sods workshop is a great place for it because of all the free wood and open space. I did a treehouse maze with punji boards and secret drops.
---
I don't even know how to launch a nuke
---
I don't know if this is the issue you are having but this is what happened to me:
---
I first tried uploading mods to the steam version by putting the ba2 file in the data folder located in Steamapps/common/Fallout76 and then using the custom.ini file under documents/my games/fallout 76. The fallout76custom.ini file was just a new notepad document I created. Unfortunately, this did not work for me. I instead had to copy the fallout76 configuration settings file (also located under documents/my games/fallout 76). I then changed the name of the copied file to fallout76Custom. I opened up this file, cleared everything on it and put in the regular code that you would put into the custom.ini file.
---
This worked for me. But again, I don't know if this is the issue you are having or something different. Just know that mods do work with steam.
---
Edit: On a side note, I was never able to get loose file mods to work with steam. Only the ba2 files.
---
Thanks, thats good to know.
---
wait.. what?
---
yeah it was hell finding all of that ballistic fiber to craft it and even harder to repair it. I almost never have to repair my power armor. ever since i stopped wearing the chinese suit i have 100+ ballistic fiber just lying around
---
I love this post. I, too am one of those players who will give a lower level player all kinds of stuff which seems stupid easy to acquire at my level. There are only a few a-hole griefers out there who seem hell bent on making people miserable. It‚Äôs all the awesome people that make this community great!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Thank you for checking! I‚Äôll wait on getting it then. I was excited when I found out the vault 94 could be displayed.
---
didnt know you could tame legendary mobs
---
It hasnt started(whining already) and you havent thoroughly read through the description of what is going to happen.
---
have you done the enclave quest yet? i always thought is was really difficult but with a good build it is easy
---
Are you two trying to complete the quests at the same time? And who is the leader? With the wastelanders update, they added instanced areas specific to team leaders, and I think this applies to who's active quest it is now too
---
I personally love helping newbs out, whether giving them free gear, plans, or whatever they need. Hell, even a companion on a quest, anything to help, I'm down :) My IGN is DarkMennoch.
---
i seen the rewards. Seems ok .
---
I've got into the bunker but idk what to do next. I doubt my unarmed melee guy will be able to do it solo
---
I just want to put cues and balls on my pool table...
---
I'm jusy waiting for someone to recreate Bioshock's Rapture underwater lol
---
Im sorry but like... lmfaoo
---
Off the top of my head, there were issues with:
---
\-how the game would be deleting itself
---
\-the speed of the game being tied to it's framerate
---
\-The supposed array of bugs and glitches
---
\-Some updates being forty gigabytes big.
---
Edit: All of these are not current, I think.
---
can‚Äôt remember exactly what to do but i‚Äôm sure you can find it on youtube. but it might be hard to actually get through the silo with a melee but in sure you can. what level are you?
---
Level 71 almost 72
---
It keeps attacking my stupid blackberry bushes and the noise it makes is unbelievably annoying
---
Each set is gonna be 700+ atoms also why not just be able to place those down in your camp as furniture is placed but instead just use the junk item as the resource?
---
i can‚Äôt remember when but i didn‚Äôt launch my first nuke until level 80-90 ish and i felt like that was way too late. but you should be good as long as you do a lot of damage, damage resistance and stims
---
hmm I might consider that change up at some point- I liked the bass and chairs, but over weekend switched to a stove with pipes sticking out with neon letters on the wall behind it, "pipe is life" with 3 vault dweller plushies circled around it staring at the pipes
---
You mean there's no dueling going on yet in front of the entrance to Crater or Foundation ? ;)
---
I appreciate you not spoiling it for me. I most definitely prefer to encounter it in-game. Thank you.
---
happens to me now with my quad handmade even.  pretty annoying
---
Yes you only scrap things in your inventory. You can craft directly out of your stash though.
---
Short answer: No. The game hasn't been fixed so much as band-aided. It's still full of bugs, some of them game breaking.
---
Lol, I've seen your videos before looking for ideas and such, wasn't exactly what I was looking for so jumped through it pretty quick, but I remember seeing it 8)
---
Add me if you want, not saying ill be there 24/7 and dont really have a mic but idk: "jcxcovert"
---
Idk man. Sometimes updates are big. Games can glitch or have bugs. Those aren‚Äôt Fallout 76-only issues. Idk anything about frame rate - I‚Äôm a casual gamer. It‚Äôs always looked good and played well for me on Xbox. Maybe the PC experience is different? Fallout 4 notoriously plays horribly on console but better on PC. Maybe 76 is the reverse?
---
Dunno. Only other thing it could be would be combo of perks, skill points, and armor used.
---
This deserves WAAAAY more upvotes, awesome job my dudeüéäüéä
---
I figure theyre finally gonna fix it, probably when a ton of people get max rank without paying anything. I kinda doubt they would ban for it, but i hope they do. 150 atoms per rank seems pretty resonable, depending on how hard it is to rank up. An hour or two a day personally is easy, though i can see how it could be an issue for someone currently working. It seems like the season is going to last about 100 days given the end of june to mid sept date, but i guess well see how hard itll be.
---
Waterkings reply is correct, but there's a little that can be added to it. Or you use to be able to do this, I haven't tried in a very long time, so it might have changed.
---
If you are on a console, no idea about PC, you can find someone on your current server and search their GT/PSN (or use the recent players tab under social in game) to possibly rejoin the same server. If they are appearing online, and haven't server hopped or something happened to make them change servers.
---
I use to do that to griefers back when players could destroy your camp on a whim. Multi story camp with everything that could be destroyed at the top, and when they went up there to start the destruction I'd log out, let them fall to their deaths, log back in using their GT, and take their junk...
---
Not planning on building one but thanks for the tip
---
Not really. If you get one to max and keep it alive, you can still get the best rewards.
---
I'd be more concerned about a skilled hacker making us think we had detected one.
---
anyone else want a mount-and-blade-esque fallout game with ACTUAL FUCKIN PLAYER MADE AIRSHIPS? like, all those settlements and shit you're building? those are airbases, and the raiders are on the march, and the supermutants are growing in number, and oh god oh fuck where did all these mirelurks and deathclaws come from, why is the base on fire? i wanted to uprgrade to concrete, but nooooo, half our workers are down with the flu and about to die because that last attack blew off the head of the only doctor we have.  wait, i basically want Rimworld, But In Fallout.
---
His inventory varies. Just bad luck. Meat week will be your friend.
---
From what it said, each season would average ten weeks. And the main way to rank up besides experience points would be completing daily and weekly challenges, minus the reward of atoms.
---
Why would you use anything but the elder brotherhood paint?
---
It's great early game when you don't have access to good armor, if the first weapon you got leaving the vault was berserker you would be very happy.
---
But after you get access to good armor it falls off a cliff until you reach the type of ultra late game where you have access to high end legendary effects that allow you to sneak past all types of enemies and never be seen.
---
Busted stealth suit or bust really, broken unyielding armor can work, but at that point just run bloodied because you get more bang for the buck.
---
everyone? are you guys talking about me somewhere? stop reading? This is a place for discussion about fallout 76? I am deeply invested in this game and am looking to have a discussion about all parts of it.
---
He still has them. You just can't have someone hold him in place and log out and log back in to refresh the vendor like you used to before. Now you can only hope to find him again on another server and that it is in his inventory.
---
FYI you dont need to grab anything in the vault, it gives it all to you when you leave.
---
From what I understand, only other mobs can kill your pet
---
*x-files music plays in background* lol
---
Skipping ranks with atoms isn't even a big deal, I seriously doubt anyone is gonna waste atoms just to rank up. Seasons is a way to get players something to do, you don't have to spend a single atom.
---
I agree they are fun but like you said, it is a pvp activity. I do wish there were more defend missions in general. At least the blue caravan company defense event can be manually triggered. It also has cool rewards and a nice 80 cap reward. Then theres others that are random like 'line in the sand' and 'heart of the swamp' but of course none are exactly like the defense missions. You could always make a pvp build, i think angry turtle and fed76 have some nice guides on that. Either way good luck!
---
yes but the game seems to be more active on consoles.
---
As a fellow paranoid schizophrenic I feel your pain
---
I always wait until she mutates and a half to melt her unless things are going bad. Gotta let everyone have some fun at least.
---
All public events give treasury notes. So radiation rumble, SBQ, uranium fever, lode bearing, feed the people, tea time etc.
---
Anything with an ! that has the pop up notification.
---
So you are one of those idiots who ruined some of the events during fasnacht
---
Bethesda should remove SBQ and SE until they fix the issues with instant kill load outs. Just left an SE where I barely managed to get 10 shots in with a .50 prime mg that has increased fire speed. 5 second SE events aren‚Äôt worth 4 treasury notes.
---
You‚Äôre welcome...üòò
---
Ive heard its level ups not actually xp, in which case you can probably repeatedly make new characters to do it, if its xp the  yeah i got nothing, if it is level ups, just speedrun grabbing the cards in the vault a few hundred times.
---
I try to give lower level players a full set of deep pockets heavy studded leather armor, a fixer, and a BOS rifle with ammo, a few stims and rad away. It kills me how many times I've dropped something for them on PC and called them over only to see them walk away without grabbing it. SMDH I literally use the gift box drop bag.
---
I've tried those and have not been getting them. Even events that don't have the server wide notification.
---
Lmao i read up to this point annnnd i knew it was gold cheers
---
Too frustrating.  Half the time I'm the only one doing the objective.  Everyone else just sits on the feeding dispensers in stealth.
---
Now that I think is a really thoughtful idea, keep these strangely powerful weapons as a backup to get things moving if the event is stagnating. I can get onboard with that üëç
---
Maybe I'll get one one day.
---
Literally every event that pops up. Even workshop defense events.
---
Haha sounds like me xD ps4? Thou it was some time ago already, so im not sure. I remember i gave my 25lvl excavator away, when i crafted lvl50.
---
Honestly, it shouldn't of even been an option. It's quite simply a version of pay to win, minus the actual winning part.
---
That is not a perfect solution an experienced player can get their hands on some good crap way before lvl 50. On my new account I got a lvl 45 j/33/15 lever before lvl 15 so there are problems with your solution. I think the best thing would just be ad a player made description of their wares.
---
Gamer tag is jcxcovert add me if you wantü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Careful what you ask for, if the explosive legendary nerdy is any indication, rebalancing to prevent BS weapons, will just mean nerfing *everything* until only the BS weapons are viable
---
Yeah, xp has been verified by Bethesda as a means of earning score.
---
It is either in Raider Waster Bundle, or it is from having *both* bundles. Can't say for sure, cos it is unlisted and I already had the Raider Scabber Pack - but I know 100% that I didn't have the emote until I bought the Raider Waster Pack.
---
I would pay nearly any amount of money to have something similar to OCDecorator (Fallout 4 mod) that lets you place junk you have as a decorative object.
---
I'll add you when i finally get on... Yes I'm on pc add Qendadar in game name = Qen
---
For reasons I can't disclose, we see everything in our atmosphere all the way to orbit... 24/7 365, of all sizes.
---
We'd know ;)
---
oh right I thought you could do both Tipsy and Wasted On a day, turns out they're interchangeable daily quests from Biv. ty!
---
also the system will try and connect you to the closest and fastest server it can. if you are on pc or have the ability to you can change vpn settings (if you have one) and you will see more ppl.
---
It very much is true. Experienced it personally.
---
More than that  - nobody plays it, you cant really do it solo.
---
So 50% of the time no-one turns up and you cant complete it. 49% of the time people show up, but they are derps who dont know what to do and end up failing it.
---
1% you get people who understand it and complete it.
---
Comparatively almost all other events are able to be completed solo 100%
---
Will do, any preference on what role you wanna play? I‚Äôm hoping everyone has a Mic, and that raiders are assholes while settlers are polite and the enclave and BOS are asshole-ish and very military.....EDIT: this it in reply to jcxcovert
---
Thats why i wrote this. But some dont understand that it seems.
---
Again the question 'why bother' it's not even as if this game is some Fortnite multi player where you can actually make some serious money. This game is fun only and showing off...? who eevn knows what you're doing.
---
Perhaps for shits and giggles amongst a group of friends who feeding on the tears of people like me emoting thumbs down and cross faces?
---
It's not really the weapon to build heavies around, especially if you are going for power armor, as it will burn through the same cores you need for your suit. That said it is one of the best off build options for a non heavy to switch to.
---
It is extremely ammo efficient, getting 500-1000 rounds of ammo for only one core, meaning you can break it out for high volume of fire events like the queen and very reliably put out steady damage without having to sacrifice time and energy farming thousands of round of ammo for your secondary build. If you are going to be a full time heavy there are more efficient weapons for day to day operations, like the gatling gun and gatling plasma, which are also ammo efficient and deal with trash mobs on the cheap, and if you are going to be running full time heavy you will probably be able to stock up on .50 cal and such as a natural part of the build to use other more potent weapons for such boss fights.
---
Gatling laser is a decent heavy for a non heavy weapon build, but not really the best weapon for a full time heavy.
---
What if they abuse whatever and complete it in 1 minute?  
---
It won't affect you in any way. They're just skins and consumables.
---
Also we don't even know how influential is actual xp on the season's level ups.  We know for sure that challenges will be the main source,not xp. For all we know it could take a ton of xp to match 5 challenges.
---
I started hoarding my mini nukes and missiles. Those items will have a use again since no one really uses those weapons at all.
---
&gt;They know fully well they're going to one-shot her and are massive cheating cunts.
---
If this is the case I honestly have to agree.
---
Get a couple of pieces of troubleshooters armour and get hacker to level 3, hack every terminal and turn off the turrets. Makes it a lot easier.
---
If you have the Stealth armour pick the lock directly to the left as you enter into the room where the pipes need to be repaired, skipping that process shortens the task considerably.
---
(‚òû Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)‚òû Nice
---
It's the same game, maybe 50% of the bugs were fixed most still remain.  It just has npcs in it's story now though it's still 100% linear and you have zero meaningful choices to make.  It was just as fun at launch as it is now.  Problem is nothing to do but meaningless grinding once you finish that story.
---
Sorry on Xbox
---
not a paranoid schizophrenic here, some flavor of ASD and PSTD. Sorry about your pain fren. This is actually disclosed, I'm reaching a bit - but I'm just trying to remind people that they don't have to let these cowards watch them all the time. Also, if anybody has one of those tin foil hats I'll take one. I'm just saying the united states did not enter WW2 Viet -NAm or Iraq for the reasons they told people. It must be terrible to struggle with your thing, as there are plenty of real reasons to be paranoid.
---
Sorry on xbox
---
why would you down vote this it's 100% honest and true, magic shot guns, magic heavy weapons, disappearing power armor.... , the fast travel fail bug, etc....
---
That's it's damage. This is also with all 3 shotgun perks. I am also holding a junkies which kinda affects it as well. Usually it would sit around 300-600 I believe tho a fully modded one will get up to 800-900 damage
---
I really don't care about the paying atoms part. It's not like it's a tournament where players are competing for rank. 
---
It's more like pay for convenience so they can get the rewards without the grind.  The only reward that really seems like a must have is the converter, but that's at rank 5 so should be accessible to most players.
---
They do need to fix these fucking exploits, though.
---
I saw an underground haunted house that was pretty cool.

If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll give you 15k for it, I want to test it out before they‚Äôre supposedly patching it‚Äôs overkill on the queen.
---
Your GPU should always be high utilization, 90-100% is normal.
---
Hm yes and no...probably just so people wouldn't piss themselves when they wont be able to catch up.
---
Dont under estimate all the thousands of people that would complain about this. Example in Ghost Recon Breakpoint (yeah bear with me), they removed the battle pass rewards because people were whining they couldn't get everything in time. You couldnt buy that equipment with money as far as I know.
---
So ultimately it is how much disciplined you are. If the grind is fun ok. If it is unbearable then you would have a case. Until we actually try you dont have much of an argument as far as I'm concerned.
---
Let's see when it actually happens ,yes ?
---
Happy cake day btw ;)
---
Interesting. I usually dont get the spinning 3D note appear on screen, but I get credited them correctly. I have the opposite "problem" - I can only turn in 20 a day and normally have 30-40.
---
You should be getting them off the public events - this is why these events like tea time, and path of enlightenment have suddenly become popular.
---
Dunno man, some people like the feeling of superiority I guess.
---
I‚Äôve added u
---
You don't use your .38?
---
I do now lol. I knew that you needed both but I went with the jet pack first without giving it enough consideration so now I‚Äôm grinding away that next 1200. However, I have been stocking up on materials to start rolling chest pieces as soon as I have the plans, buying up modules and what not and picking up other alt piece options that have fall damage reductions
---
Oh lmfao i dont have a mic sadly, but yes it applies to everything else
---
If your on tomorrow, drop me a message on here and I'll give you 80+ plans for free... Can't remember the exact number but I know it's more than 80
---
Here's hoping man, thanks.
---
There‚Äôs a text based messenger on PS4 we‚Äôll be fine
---
You can [only accumulate 5000 gold](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/50462/~/gold-bullion---currency---fallout-76), so you might want to get interested in something:)

I'm not really running a silo easily, I die to the dominators and gutsies if I'm not careful and have to retrace from the lift a few times, but I get there eventually, my gun for the queen close up can do about 60-100 per shot, 1\* Bloodied handmade auto. It's OK I have to get enough shots to trigger a drop though. I mostly average about 30 per shot.
---
She never landed and was killed in the air. I saw her land dead.
---
This time I admit I was in pip boy for a moment to eat some meat and then she was dead. From now on I shall prepare better and get shooting immediately. Whether she was one shot precisely I have no way of knowing but between me popping into pip boy eating some SB steak and tabbing out SBQ was dead.
---
I'm over it now, my last nuke a few minutes ago client CTD, I'm on PC so lost out another nuke completely, a bummer üòí

---
Yes, but my point is player engagement wise, which I know oft isn't bethesda strong point, would be better if it reverted to atoms again after ranks.  It also make wonder if there won't be any dailys/weekly's during the few weeks left between seasons.

I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---
OküëÅüëÖüëÅüê∏
---
We haven‚Äôt had to pay for any of the DLCs or any other content, besides the initial release. They have to make money to pay for a live service game model. The way I see it, the option to buy levels with atoms makes sense. Also worth noting that many other games have this option with season pass models.
---
Hail mein frog√ºr
---
lol you have a computer but lack intelligence :)
---
Our group uses almost everything, because we just drop ammo for each other. Nobody uses .44 or .45 (it's one or the other, i can't remember now.)
---
Eh. Bulking ammo for scrapping and/or sale would still be a lot more interesting for me.
---
lol when you put it like this...
---
I do wonder if the devs realize just how absurd/impractical some of these requirements actually are.  
---
Then there are the ones that are just bugged or just simply never worked. Like collecting nuke code pieces.
---
Same. Bloodied 38 combat rifles or fixers are great. Great weapon to keep as a backup.
---
would suck if mini nukes could only be converted to missiles, and vice versa.
---
If you wanna add me on ps4 my gamer tag is jcxcovert

I‚Äôm otannehill, doing stuff at my vendor, I‚Äôll stop by and say hi in a bit

---
You have to drop a nuke on your camp. Sorry, it's the only way.
---
I wish I was. Except for the dailies I never get the 3d thing either. Nor does it show up in the reward list, but depending on how much you get, that's normal. I have to check my pipboy and see if I get any.
---
Honestly, I just thought they had a drop rate like the Possum Badges with Campfire Tales. I'll start paying more attention and recording the end of those events. Might be a glitch.
---
Like my shotgun damage not registering correctly, again (it shouldn't take 12+ shots at 244 damage per to take down a ghoul. Only happens on my shotgunner too) or me getting disconnected all the time while I'm on my heavy gunner. No other character. Just her.
---
This is the way
---
Ok!
---
Man, seeing all these makes me wanna show my base off.
---
You're going to have to be really sneaky, and good at hacking. The only thing an unarmed melee would have problems with, is the turrets.
---
What I find annoying is how many people shoot the SBQ while she's in the air this will make her keep flying! You fight all the way through the silo and don't get to finish the event because she doesn't land.
---
That is what I mean, A skilled knowledgeable hacker who uses that to make us believe that we had detected launches.
---
Bloodied auto grenade launchers are pretty entertaining. Especially on long shots with vats.
---
Yes! It would be a great way to incentivize people to subscribe to 1st. Right now the scrapbox it by far the biggest reason to subscribe.
---
Masses of Asses is a underrated and underutilized phrase
---
To receive loot from the queen. You need to do 1,000 damage to the queen. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs shooting her, stabbing her or punching her. If you do at least 1,000 damage you will definitely get rewarded. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have any powerful or strong weapons, you can still get rewarded. As long as you shoot 1,000 bullets into her. Because the smallest amount of damage you can do to her is 1. So 1,000 bullets = 1,000 damage. 
---
This was done so people are forced to participate and fight. And not people that just show up, do nothing at all, and just wanted the free reward.
---
Thanks a lot dude üòÅ
---
EmpNorton, I'm just here to keep the rabbits of the wasteland happy and appeased so they don't rise up and crush all the humans.
---
did tamables ever get added to the FU log?
---
I will drop stuff dependent on their level or stuff they could use soon enough. Or I will stay nearby them for a while and watch over them to see if they need anything
---
Do that my man üòÅ‚úåÔ∏è
---
You have to do over 1,000 damage to the keep to get loot, she has stupid high damage resistance meaning that even my Anti-Armor Explosive 160+ damage Gatling Gun will do like 2-5 damage per shot depending where I hit her. Turn on damage numbers of you want to see it yourself
---
Can I ask what/if there is a trick is for acid please? I'm starting to run out of my Fasnacht beehive acid and I don't really want to move back to a node.
---
I just want to mention how very aesthetically pleasing it is I love the design.
---
replace it with that rare 3-star brahmin...
---
(started as a joke, then looked into it, time to spawn camp Flatwoods)
---
I usually get given level 50 stuff. It annoys me, but I‚Äôm still grateful. I just stash it till it‚Äôs time
---
If it helps, the wastelanders dailys should give 3. The "easy" events like feed the people give 2, the medium difficulty give 3, and the "hard" events give 4
---
I had the same thing happen to me the other day but out of the 2 options it would only let me select the solo one. Was strange but not happened since.  Could it be someone was already in the building?
---
Yes. Absolutely yes! People were really butthurt about the tents at first too. But that died down pretty quickly. And it would still benefit non-subscribers. If you could travel somewhere that you could visit 10 vendors within walking distance you wouldnt have to waste so much time/ caps fast traveling all around the map to check peoples camp vendors.
---
That‚Äôs why I only sell a few at a time in my vendors and 350 each.  I will usually give or sell much cheaper to folks looking to actually use it.
---
With a hazmat suit ~60
---
With full power armor ~60
---
With neither of those two, 60,000
---
That is not a joke, exaggeration, and is a criminal underestimate.
---
So power armor has this invisible effect where each piece reduces the incoming magnitude of radiation by a stacking 15%
---
With 6 pieces you have 90% less radiation, so the nuke zone goes from 60 rads per second to 6, 60 radiation resistance with then calculate to reduce that by 80% down to 1.2, because of diminishing returns it does not get much better to have more than that amount, 
---
The hazmat suit/stealth suit also have an invisible effect that reduces incoming radiation by 90% straight up, meaning they again need very little actual radiation resistance to mitigate rads, they could have a value of 50 and still beat all other forms of radiation resistance combined. This is why the broken hazmat suit is just as good as the normal one, because rad resist doesn't actually matter.
---
Normal armor doesn't get anything, so  you need to straight reduce the 60 rads per second by having bigger rad resist numbers. to start to get down the radiation to the same level of hazmat suits and power armor start with (-90%) you need to have 20x the amount of resistance as radiation, for 60 that means 1200 rad resist just to get down to 6, now to get down a further 90% like they do you now need to go over the hard cap on radiation resistance from rad resist alone (can't reduce more than 90%). 
---
After that because diminishing returns are a hardcore thing you need to reach the threshold of 1000x radiation to get to a total 95%(5% more than 1200 rad resist) theoretical reduction. 60 x 1000 = 60,000 to get to 3 rads/second.
---
The ONLY way to get the plans people actually want out of it, the stimpak diffuser and the bear arm/its mods, is to clear all three sectors in the second phase of the event.
---
This is actually fairly easy to do... if you have at least three or more people participating with three or more brain cells each.
---
If any sector is left to rot and the friendly creature goes down then the event is a waste.  I gave up entirely even when you'd end up with half the server showing up they would all cluster in one room and asking them to spread out and cover the other sectors was usually met screaming how I can't control how people play the game.
---
Oh heck ya!!
---
Hope there isn't a cap on the point system.
---
Wonderfully helpful, thank you both. The Gauss pistol is doing roughly 200/shot. I figure I actually hit her about half my shots, 40 on a quad drum magazine gauss pistol. 
---
40 shots x 200 damage/shot = 8,000 damage
---
While at first I thought this was most certainly player error I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding this.
---
Good point. I didn‚Äôt even think of that .
---
Robot vendors only allow up to $1,400 per day, each serum gives 500 caps per day, you can only sell two per day. By selling them cheaper to players we can recoup the caps spent on the serum recipes which can be substantial for many of us.
---
Yes you can trade the compound bow, you just can't trade the plans for it. 
---
I've gotten a few from the purveyor and tossed them in the WS icebox for someone to scrip.
---
Yep, great idea!
---
I quit early on primarily due to A) griefers and B) server disconnects.  I rejoined about a month ago and it is so much more playable.  Bugs is bugs...they aren't killing the fun for me.
---
Thanks! That‚Äôs what I figured. I have about 6-7 modules already set aside for a start. I‚Äôll be sure to equip my tinfoil hat when I begin crafting just incase
---
Have you pacified him? I‚Äôve got a Scorched DC and he used to ‚Äúrampage‚Äù on turrets, stalks of corn and an occasional lamp post. I made a post identical to this and somebody mentioned pacifying him. So I did, it only lasted 30-45 seconds...so I did it again, and again and again and finally 1 stuck and he has been that way ever since. A pacified DC isn‚Äôt the best for home defense...molerats to super mutants, they don‚Äôt phase
---
You gotta buy something to make the extra 100, I buy ammo scrap kits ( what ever they are called)
---
It would be awesome if we could play  Caravan. Play with players/NPCs find cards and build decks. Gamble with caps, bullion and scrip. The social and having something to pass the time when things are slow would be awesome. Run into someone and emote want to play Carvan.
---
Stay in the forest (green area, left side of the map) until about L15.  Do events, roam, learn the lore. Follow the overseers questline.  It will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.  Find and work on the questlines for mysteries, firebreathers, responders...recruitment blues.
---
At 20, move north to the toxic valley.  Join the pioneer scouts.
---
At 30, go S to the ash heap.  Work on the Miner Miracles quest.
---
at 40, head into the divide.
---
at 45-50, go anywhere you want.
---
If you find yourself up against stuff many times your level (Roses Early quest will quicky take you places low levels should not be). Back burner that objective and revisit later.
---
Tis game is a marathon, not a sprint.  Walk when you can.  You will discover lots of things you completely miss by fast traveling.
---
At train stations, or wherever you see maps with pushpins, click on the pushpins.  It adds locations to your map.
---
If you have a mic, use it.
---
Most high levels will help you.
---
Can NPCs still steal weapons?
---
This is exactly why I sell for 400 and it‚Äôs VERY rare I get entirely cleared out. I usually sell ones and twos of each at most, I‚Äôve been cleared out totally 3 times total. 
---
I will use the odd serum for the 1400 daily cap earning if I need to get off or haven‚Äôt collected enough water etc to do it. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about people making profit by reselling or whatever, I‚Äôd rather have the slow progressive cap turnover than be stuck with them forever.
---
The game needs an auction house system like the other mmorpgs and a mailing system to securely transfer items to mules. Put the auction houses at crater and foundation.
---
I believe I saw something on YouTube about the conversion machine. Compared to the amount of ammo it would take to feed it  the returns are minuscule.
---
same here I also managed to buy some holiday gifts, I'm now going to stalk some low level players
---
I hope I can figure out what's going on, or BGS fixes it if it's a bug, because 9 per day, reliably, is taking forever and I'm starting to get burnt out. I've stuck with this game, almost a daily player since launch, sadly took a break around Halloween last year and missed out on that event, but the grind of only getting 9 a day is a bitch. Once this virus shit is over, I doubt I'll hit the 1700 per week, even if I start getting them from the events.
---
I give them away to people who need them for free.  Back in the day they used to sell for 1.5k ( a few months after release) the suggested price from the game is 2000 caps.
---
I like to buy the odd serum, if I'm respecing my mutations, I buy one of each, but then I don't run a vending machine.
---
Very true.
---
 It your smart for only selling a few at a time
---
That technology is only available to the military, NASA, and other organizations that make use of powerful radar systems.
---
To my knowledge.
---
Found it on him about 2 months ago.
---
I'm done with them after going into two that were trap camps.
---
When I need to top my caps off, I sell em at 299 just to get cleaned out, if people want to flip them, be my guest. I used to do that before I maxed out caps across two accounts and now I don't really pay attention to it.
---
I downloaded it on a free play weekend and I‚Äôve been able to play it since then as I owned it on the Bethesda launcher
---
Displays make sense, as it takes more work for the server to render all the different objects. Turrets I suppose it's because of the fact they're animated, and they're sort of active almost like a character because they target and attack enemies with a degree of (broken) AI. Crops are technically an interactive item and they produce a resource based on a timed schedule so the game needs to process and track all that information. It's unfortunate that anything with an actual purpose cuts seriously into the budget, but I imagine the servers would explode without those limitations. Hopefully once instanced camps come out, we'll have a little more freedom in terms of budget with things placed into a separate cell, rather than on the world map shared with everything else on the server.
---
I just had half my stock cleaned out I‚Äôve seen people buy up to five until now, but this person bought 28 marsupials, 15 twisted muscles, and 12 grounded before I quit the server.
---
Because it fails too often.
---
You have to make sure it has more than one udder, otherwise the milk comes out to thick.
---
I love finding a camp with reasonably priced sera and a rad arch, I make use of both, very handy. It's fun to experiment with different mutations sometimes.
---
I've not yet bought any of the recipes.
---
I thought that had been fixed, someone will correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
---
That's good to know but I shouldn't really have to use a workaround like that right? I mean they told us if we linked we would get it for free by the end of april
---
Someone here on Reddit datamined the conversion rates and they are super low. Don‚Äôt get too excited...... you will be putting a boatload in and only getting a few shells out.
---
The event is fairly easy but most of the people in the event do only 1 area and stay afk I've had 10 people do the event but had all of them either run to site A or afk on the site It's all due to laziness or people having no idea what to do when the details are on the quest marker they were all level 100+ mind you
---
I just got sick of waiting, lol!
---
If they don‚Äôt get back to you, hope is not lost.
---
I thought you could only get the from the Purveyor if you bought the plans for the Compound Bow? That is something I've not done, I bought it from a player's vendor who was selling 3 compound bows, all level 50 I believe.
---
They weigh next to nothing so there is no real cost or keeping them. The cost to make them is high as most pure flux sells for 200 and the plans costs me 17500.  I‚Äôm not gonna grind even more flux to make someone else a profit. Break even is all I want, and caps are mostly worthless at this point. I just buy bulk junk from robo-vendors. It‚Äôs harder to spend them than make them.
---
Hey what platform are you on man? If you're on PC I can help you out with some stuff!
---
They used to be constantly active here, now not nearly as much.
---
I mentioned to a mate a while ago, to extend the game and keep it popular introduce an art workbench.
---
You can already skin up guns and armour easy enough, so give people the chance with colours, typeface and in-game designs to jazz up their stuff. Once applied within a set system I can't see how it couldn't work.
---
Plus the chance to simply fill shelves with junk and other stuff in the workshop menu is a must.
---
The Venture Scout Beaver level is still unused somwhy not add a mission or two for a 'Clean up Appalachia' achievement. This would award you with plans adding 'C.A.M.P Clutter' to the Workshop and you could use any junk you find, a la OCDecorator, to place around your CAMP within budget. All you'd need was the specific junk to fill the placing.
---
Anything is better than just dropping them
---
One bad apple can ruin the bunch.
---
someone i was with for swarm of suitors was using one, i would snipe out the main suitor and then a carpet of 40mm came down on the swarm.  hilarious body ragdolls everywhere
---
i was able to offload a bunch of 40mm, it was a good day
---
Two shots ones are also fun against hordes
---
Well, you can get a new copy on amazon for $13 or so. Comes with a code for 500 atoms, which is about $5 worth of in game currency, so really you‚Äôd be only paying about $8 if you want to think of it that way. 
---
That‚Äôs how I justified buying the game originally last year after a free weekend. Considering I‚Äôve played probably 250+ hours, the EFI or enjoyment for investment, is quite good.
---
Also, FYI, after they "fixed" the vendor dupe the time *before* they disabled vendors for a week or so, i went to a camp who had an Atom Shop cosmetic for sale which would've been done via the duping method at the time. At the time I didn't know what was going on, so I tried to buy it - but the game wouldn't complete the purchase! It just kinda hung there and I had to close the vendor.
---
After that I had a read about it and realised it would've been duped using a vendor bug. So basically, if an item
---
Is untradeable it now seems to also be unvendorable in all cases.
---
&gt;other organizations that make use of powerful radar systems.
---
Oh, You mean like China. 
---
And I think you misunderstand what I am saying. I am saying that I am more worried about a bad actor hacking into the computer systems and making it show a false launch. Now they would have to have a understanding of the systems but knowing how vast the US nuclear arsenal is there are probably a lot of people with that knowledge.
---
you dont gotta do it dawg
---
I went on late last night to just pull a screen cap of my build. That's it.  Then I had people at my vendors so I stuck around. In comes a level 3, on a mic.  He walked up to me and said he was new and asked for permission to set his camp nearby!   I gave a thumbs up and was intrigued so I followed him around.   I eventually came on mic too and, loooooong sorry short, he was legit new and I helped him get to level 10 and loaded him up with materials, ammo, guns, and even a few spare rare outfits and plans I had. It was a good time.
---
I'm not saying the game doesn't have problems that deserve to be criticized, but this sub wonders why bethesda doesn't respond to things here more often while simultaneously upvoting a post comparing them to apes to the front page.
---
That‚Äôd be sick
---
Update: My dumbass didn‚Äôt scroll down on the tinkerers workbench menu. It was under ultracite ammo under the souvenirs tab...
---
That‚Äôs some pretty good per shot damage your pistol is putting out on the queen. I‚Äôve got the plans to craft but waiting on inventory space to clear up. 
---
What legendary effects you have on that thing?
---
settler rep:
---
- wards daily mission
---
- davenports daily (take photos of crater -&gt; give to ward)
---
- grind hella amount of random encounters

---
- farm legendary enemies

Looks like you have to complete the events fully, i.e. to the best level to get the notes.
---
So I'm guessing not having the queen spawn (suitors), keeping all 3 machines running (feed the people), not losing any pipes (tea time) etc.
---
Thnx! What does the Ally daily give you and what are good places to farm legendary enemies?
---
Good, now to match a hazmat suit or power armor you only need to add another 59 000 rad resist.
---
With 6 pieces you have 90% less radiation, so the nuke zone goes from 60 rads per second to 6, 60 radiation resistance with then calculate to reduce that by 80% down to 1.2, because of diminishing returns it does not get much better to have more than that amount,
---
Normal armor doesn't get anything, so you need to straight reduce the 60 rads per second by having bigger rad resist numbers. to start to get down the radiation to the same level of hazmat suits and power armor start with (-90%) you need to have 20x the amount of resistance as radiation, for 60 that means 1200 rad resist just to get down to 6, now to get down a further 90% like they do you now need to go over the hard cap on radiation resistance from rad resist alone (can't reduce more than 90%).
---
Edit* every time that I have updated wifi or changed something it has always gone back to the blue screen just to clarify.
---
I keep one on a toon and just funnel the ammo from the others. Once I have a couple hundred grenades I'll break it out. It's honestly powerful enough to take out most enemies in a shot or two. Lobbing them great distances in VATS and watching them arc forever is entertaining.
---
It's amazing how fast I'll burn through ammo even with funneling from four others.
---
I checked again. Damage is 277. I have max gunslinger rank with a hardened receiver.
---
This is the best f***ing idea ever!
---
Gotcha. Yes, I was misunderstanding, thank you for the clarification!
---
Happy cake day, wastelander üç∞
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say the fast travel fail bug is game breaking. I haven‚Äôt run into the disappearing power armor bug in a long time (I was pretty sure that was fixed...?). 
---
A lot of the bugs have been fixed and I only run into a few now and then. 
---
I think the most annoying is some of the quests can be a little buggy and some NPCs have to be talked to 3-4 times to get their dialogue trees to progress.
---
I‚Äôm low level. I‚Äôll let you revive. GODISALIVE7_7_7.  In friend request let me know why the request please
---
Check just north of the spawn in point for the miner memorial south of Whitesprings. I see the trick or treater there a lot, but it takes a decent amount of server hopping.
---
also ultracite plasma cartridges for the plasma caster
---
I always nuke a camp if its near Whitesprings or other good nuke targets :)
---
Mines up near Palace of the winding path so Idk if that's a nuke spot usually
---
Hmm not letting me join for some reason
---
the ally normally gives you a daily fetch quest of some sort, and as a reward gives you a legendary item. (commander normally gives me random 3 star weapons, YMMV) 
---
this is a smaller thread, but should give you a few ideas on where to look.  im dont personally do much legendary grinding
---

If you still need help let me know
---
Yeah, unless I need the meat for rep, the queen never spawns, and with free range unless the cows try to attack the sheepsquatch, they are always alive too. But still a no go most of the time. Tea time and feed the people haven't been an issue completing either. But no notes.
---
I put in a ticket explaining and asking about it, but I'm pretty sure I'll get the auto response for needing more information. Trying to upload clips to them is annoying af. Not sure how I'm going to catch the end of the event in 10ish second clip...
---
There are a lot of entitled cowards in the world buddy. They‚Äôre too much of a coward to risk anything, but still feel like it‚Äôs their right to take what they want from others in the most vile of ways.
---
It‚Äôs why PVP is so pathetic at times.
---
People won‚Äôt 1v1 you face to face, but they‚Äôll gladly fight you with 3 other people on their team all the meanwhile talking trash and pretending like their all-of-a-sudden-tough. Bunch of entitled cowards that have no appreciation for ‚Äúdoing the work‚Äù or ‚Äúdoing their best‚Äù.
---
They are losers. The type of people that pick the same overused character in a fighting game and cheese everyone with the same move. They‚Äôll lose in the long run, and won‚Äôt improve themselves, but getting a cheesy victory every once in a while is enough for losers like that to feel validated.
---
They‚Äôre pathetic.
---
Hah. Now a post apocalyptic version of that song would actually be awesome. Truthfully I'm surprised Bethesda hasn't added any new music to the radio üôÅ
---
Colossal Problem isnt in game yet - future update
---
They had a chance to do an actually entertaining daily quest and they squandered it. It‚Äôs baffling.
---
Time to put on Scrounger 3 and pick up ALL the ammo.
---
Think It's worth around 5-10k
---
I'm on xbox and I'm not sure how to do the pan effect or record it for that matter.
---
Eh... I sell for 275. If someone wants to clear me out so be it.
---
Try rebuilding the database? It always helped me for any fo4 issues, might help for 76 too.
---
Update 20 comes on Tuesday, but if the update and DB rebuild don‚Äôt work, I‚Äôd put in a support ticket with Bethesda.
---
Good luck!
---
Tato soup isn‚Äôt real, he can‚Äôt help you
---
Tato soup:
---
No one said game breaking just bugs that still exist
---
Bethesda could probably turn all the fashnatch masks into backpack skins and make a killing in the atom shop.
---
Oh. Ok. Thanks. I figured it was probably duped like crazy and worthless now. Glad to see they didn't ruin that with all the mass dupes.
---
Yes you can only get it from the purveyor if you have it learned. Same for all of the wastelanders items, only the bows can be traded, the rest can't.
---
I'm a hoarder of all things. Ammo dropping was always the one thing I hated doing but the rate I collect I had no choice. So this will be a nice change.
---
I am however sick of things that make a large difference to the playerscape being behind a grind/paywall. This ammo converter should just be part of the game. This is coming from someone who grinds every single event to its fullest buys atoms and 1st.
---
So yes I'm excited but wish it was part of the core game.
---
I would wear it every Wednesday lol
---
Exactly! Right now certain ammos are completely worthless.
---
that isnt very civil...
---
Is that the base damage or actual damage after factoring in her DR?
---
Not necessarily a dupe. I had a couple of my atom shop skinned items show up in my vendor during the fuck up with displays and vendors, most couldn't be purchased, but I think a couple went through.
---
Wait why shouldn‚Äôt xp earned give you score? Why do you call that out? 
---
If there is an xp exploit, the exploit is the problem. Not the xp giving you score.
---
really? well they nuked it anyways. i could have swore that rifle gaming did the event, but he could have had early access
---
I believe the recent dupe required you to have atleast 5 of the single item. And since riding shotgun was still pretty new not all The dupers had 5 of the backpack plans. Just a theory (:
---
Sometimes when you fast travel a nearby corpse will follow you.  It becomes comical when it‚Äôs a large enemy like a SB or queen.  I‚Äôve had them follow me over several fast travels.
---
All we ever got was "we're passing this along to the devs" and a BUNCH of empty promises.
---
If it's TSE, I would keep it in my collection, but if it's just TS, then it's 10 caps.
---
And public events.
---
I get it all the time from my Communist Collectron. I also get Tato Soup from it, which gives 10 Poison Resist.
---
But I can only craft 'Sweet Tato Stew' but the only listed benefit on that is Health Regen. I don't have the mats so I can't craft it, or else I'd check to see if this was an unlisted benefit.. but basdd on all those soup benefits in the screencap, I'd say they probably just chowed down on the findings of their Communist Collectron.
---
Base damage
---
Just move the blueberries üòÇ
---
Good on you. When you run outa ultracite scrap, or flux then you might be burnt.
---
Good to know!
---
??? I sell them for what I consider a fair price. What someone else does with it after they buy it is none of my business.
---
Yeah, kind of like actual mutated gorillas and tigers and lions and what not. I feel like it would be a good addition. People would especially love it if you could pacify them and create actual zoo‚Äôs as camps
---
it should be in your library if you linked properly
---
I had a few very nice players help me out early on and now I help anytime I can. I hate when I log on to a server to find players that harass though
---
Whenever I have excess plans, armor or items, I usually find the lowest level player and give them the stuff. It's cool and feels good to help Kickstart someone's journey
---
Maybe Bc you only used 200 rounds and barely did any damage?
---
Man I just wish people would follow the simple mechanics of this quest.  Not that hard. Haven't come across a quick kill but have seen players kill her with 3 hits.  I mean nothing broken with the builds at all......
---
I need a new mic since it broke. I used to go around as an Appalachian building inspector and tell people their camps weren't up to code
---
People are friendly. In my experience people won‚Äôt turn on their mics until they hear that you are using yours.
---
Turn your damage numbers on and look what is actually going into the queen.
---
congrats!
---
just post the link.. you cant embed images in this sub
---
I was going to someone‚Äôs base cause I wanted to check what they had and there was no base in like wth and I looked in the ground and there‚Äôs a friggin guitar chair I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs sick
---
But the tato soup collected by the communist collectron was stolen from the bourgeois :(
---
Falling off cliffs/jumping down from high places are my most common use for PA, now that my Chinese Stealth armor protects so well from radiation damage. I‚Äôm an FC, after all! :)
---
New math is 277 damage x 40 rounds (not 200) =
---
11,080 damage. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúbarely any damage‚Äù.
---
This^
---
Wait, what buff does the peanut butter sandwich give you?
---
Nope. It occurred the first time I logged in after wastelanders went live. My display cases were randomized, my vendor had all my top tier weapons listed at their base price and there were atom shop skinned items on there.
---
I yanked out my leather coats/ BE handmades and such while someone was browsing my vendor, didn't lose anything important. But some items that were 90% reduced weight and skinned for display got sold. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/YnRHZKC.png this is what my bobblehead stand looked like the first day I logged in.
---
Is it worth paying the extra cash for Fallout 76: Wastelanders Deluxe Edition? I want to buy the game today.
---
Tweak your setting so you see actual damage per hit and have a good cry.
---
if your more of a single player guy who like story, get fallout 4.
---
Hahaha that is an amazing screencap üòÇ
---
And fair enough. I'll delete my original comment then seeing as it is inaccurate. Thanks for the updated info
---
I wonder if fusion cores can be sold to it since they are technically ammo
---
Adding to the already solid reply...all dailies (except the Pioneer Scouts) give scrip. You get more for the harder areas. Just look in your Pip Boy for daily quests.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt see them allowing that but if it does happen then that would be cool
---
I barrly have anyone to play with and im on ps4 too:"jcxcovert"
---
They're a multimillion dollar company, not your 12 year old cousin
---
True, but at least they will not be taking up space in inventory. I think people are just looking forward to offloading thos 40mm, missles, and nukes.
---
It's actually occurring again right now with the beer stein case. I've seen people with helmets, and junk items showing up in them.
---
Along with junk items being salvaged for scrap directly from display cases, lost a clean mr. handy fuel recently that way.
---
acid can be tricky, I know if you're super desperate hemlock holes is clearly an easy choice but that's not the point. The best way I've found is to server hop and go to locations on this list: [list here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic). Other than what is listed there, do all the public events in the ash heap while looting the ever loving shit out of every building near them since there are a ton of acetone canisters. Also make sure that, everywhere you go, you are looking for those colorful little bottles and disused industrial cans, antifreeze, and coolant. Tenagra town also has a lot of cave crickets so for farming you can server jump there while murder pasting all the crickets. Floaters can also be found around nearly every super mutant encampment + plentyful in the mire.
---
This is cool but what I really want is a chess board display, a few times I have found small chess pieces shaped like different robots ( no not the little modles) and they are just so tiny for the big display cases we have currently would be nice to have a display that looked like a chess board
---
&gt;Unless she was literally 1 shot, there is still a decent amount of time to dish out some damage to her.
---
One this morning died in a few seconds without mutating while at long range in the air.  Griefers going to grief.  No Fasnachts to ruins so they gotta do something.
---
Wait is sneak speed the only thing that sneak bonus on the fixer does? If so that‚Äôs really lame, I thought it made you harder to detect or something.
---
I know what you mean but it is legit armor made from trash. You could explain it away simply by changing the name.
---
You still have the extra wrapped cap? Ive been looking for one as well.  Ive got caps and/or ammo I can offer
---
That's actually a really great idea. Placing your camp in the area next to a event that you want to grind over and over to try to get a specific reward.
---
it's just a bunch of cosmetic crap, arguably better cosmetics exist already in game. Really it's up to you.
---
A lot of enemy‚Äôs might of attacked it. I had the sand thing happen to me
---
May be buying for alts and friends but more likely just flipping. Very frustrating.
---
What are instanced camps? How would that work?
---
I already use the ammo converter in the game and it's great.  I convert ammo into more bag space by hucking it on the ground.
---
I'd be hyped for an ammo denier.  One that blocks ammo that you don't want from getting into your inventory.  Getting grenades and mini nukes as quest rewards are in fact quest punishments.
---
Have you heard of r/FO76FILTHYCASUALS yet? Good place to meet chill people who are always helpful.
---
Sorry man I had to raid it.
---
Omfg thanks, lowkey perfect description of my playstyle :P
---
That‚Äôs extremely nice. Someone just yesterday gave me 500 free shotgun shells, which I was in desperate need of. He saw me buying them from his camp and decided to just give me all of them for free. Great lad, great game
---
I mean, everything can just be repaired like nothing ever happened.
---
I had to delete the game and reinstall
---
If possible disconnect the speakers either in volume settings or unplug them and make your headphones have prio then start the game and see if that works.
---
I typically search every container I find for a chance at screws. Hotplates, desk/office fans, typewritters, tongs, Hubcaps. Literally anything I can get my grubby hands on.
---
I guess it does suck that it is only going to be limited time but at least it‚Äôs free
---
I got nuked yesterday. Entire base gone. Reduced to atoms
---
OK, great! I'll just get the main game, and I can always get the extra content at a later time if I decide I want it. I was mostly wanting to make sure I was getting the Wasteland portion of the game. Thanks for your response!
---
Someone nuked just north of the town and I found a bunch of cobalt on the mountain.
---
I have been collecting every type of extra ammo types for the past 2 weeks lol I'm almost capped for my storage
---
It will be a good game in a few years, it‚Äôs taking baby steps in the right direction there is no endgame atm tho, all one big grind at the end. Just needs more missions and daily/event variety and it will be a fun game, NW needs work too haha
---
Life is weird sometimes.  I learned this yesterday when I found a camp with ‚Äòserums sell 500 caps to robot‚Äô.  There were dozens in their machines.
---
I'm kinda sad about it, actually. I load up all my unused ammo for free in my vending machines because I love visitors. 
---
Exception: the creeper who literally stood next to my bed for over 30 minutes, coming out to punch me everytime I went to my tinker bench. Domestic violence pedo, not cool.
---
My initial reaction was radioactive flying monkeys, like Wozard of Oz...only glowing, and dropping deuces worse than pigeons
---
Extreme happiness for a few minutes until its gone
---
I've never done a 3 animal one.  I've gotten the Formula P recipe I think from a 1 animal and I got the bear arm plan from a 2 animal, one maxed.
---
I wonder what goes through the heads of those kind of people . I remember in fasnacht someone just was repeatedly punching me the whole time
---
I always advise low level players to scrap any armor and weapons they find. 
---
1-Scrap
---
2-Possible new weapon/armor modifications 
---
3-Later be able to sell stuff a higher price 
---
4-Generally spend less caps in the long run
---
(Minus enclave weapons and armor. Your stuck buying stuff directly from them
---
Haha still better than op
---
Oh. Well I should probably stop joining these then. Lol
---
I did this when I was like level 22. Had gotten a Mirv Fatman from a chest, and had 20 mininukes on me and decided to give this quest a try. Fun times!
---
Did you launch Bravo on another server?
---
That‚Äôs genius
---
I'm just gonna guess they were very new to the game and didn't know what to do, that maybe they didn't mean it... But tbh at this point it can be whatever. 
---
But... Even if you're new to the game, I don't think they were unable to follow me around and see what I was doing, or at least killing things, instead of standing there and rushing to the terminal.
---
Que? All the dailies are really easy to do, what are you talking about? They can be done in about 20 minutes.
---
Also from what I heard, these objectives aren‚Äôt going anywhere, you‚Äôll still have to do them, they‚Äôll just pay the stupid ass points for the battle pass instead of atoms, which I am not a fan of at all.
---
Not really I used to one shot people when I played too
---
As others have already pointed out 1,000 damage is the threshold. The main issue is, IIRC, the queen has something like 60-80% damage resistance **before** DR/ER stats, as well as a high explosive resistance. So you need a solid weapon setup to chip some damage in.
---
Not Bethesda though, they don't seem to mind cheaters in their game one bit.
---
We got a team you can join us, we help each other and give stuff to each other
---
Basically all my duplicate plans and extra food and water and what ever I have left that I really don't need by the end of a session, I travel to vault 76 and drop it all on the handrail
---
i heard adding jelly gives a small AP regen boost
---
Where is the best place to go noob hunting to give them plans. I had a guy do this for me at rank 7 and i have a ton of plans to drop.
---
Honestly thought this was gonna be about the cymbal monkeys in the game that do nothing but show damage counters at the moment kinda wish there was a backpack with the cymbal monkey on it and maybe a George Romero reference would be sick
---
You must come by the flux REALLY easy then.
---
If you are spending 600 caps on serums and selling them for a thousand you are losing out on selling all the junk you acquire. 
---
I nuke Morgantown and get 40-60 Glowing blood which I sell for 500 caps, selling everything you pick up from Uranium Fever will net you 600-800 caps. 
---
I sell all serums for 350 caps and have never been cleaned out.
---
wait
---
someone did nuke the area I was in ..
---
Does THAT destroy the base ? How dumb is that!
---
and how can I repair everything , all the items, decorations in base do not even show up as destroyed, just the walls ewtc ...
---
Any help appreciated
---
regards
---
JM
---
Not these kinds, but I heard from my father‚Äôs brother‚Äôs nephew‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs former roommate that they ARE working on Rad Monkeys.
---
See, Starfield is really a code for Fallout 5. In which, you‚Äôll play a sleeper USSA astronaut. You crash on a planet and have to fight super intelligent apes in the introduction area. Only after escaping do you find out you‚Äôre in New York.   
---
‚ÄúOh my god.. I‚Äôm back. I‚Äôm.. home.. All this time. You finally, really did it.‚Äú  
---
‚ÄùYou COMMUNISTS! You blew it up! Damn you all to hell!‚Äù
---
And then the non hostile Super Mutant with the nice garden in the Statue of Freedom‚Äôs crown yells ‚ÄúShut up humie!‚Äù At you.
---
Ehmm score challenges are exactly the same, as datamined. I wanted you to know this.
---
Everything in my vending machines is 1 cap. Dollar general fight me.
---
Where did you have it placed? Environmental collision can cause unexpected damage. I came across someone's camp the other day that was placed partially on railroad tracks. As it spawned it, a whole corner of his building exploded. I'm guessing it was trying to settle down onto the ground during spawn, but railroad track caused collision damage? Hard to say for sure.
---
Unless it's crunchy, then it's a debuff.
---
When you get it installed feel free to add me. IGN G1ew, I like to roll with new players. Helps them out and gives me something to do.
---
Yeah it's a real kick in the balls. I was so pissed. Lost my deathclaw. Even if you're on passive mode. Technically it wasn't the player. It was the Nuke who done it
---
True this, pumpkin house and Camden park should be almost neighbors not across the map. Lol
---
Im open for it, if u want
---
It'd be cool to find a small ragtag bunch of them making the trip to Appalachia for 'The Treasure' only for you to inform them it's been found.
---
A random event out on the edges of the Map.North or West would be best obviously. You could direct them to Crater and after that a few pieces of armour could be found and legendary versions added to your pool.
---
Hardly the realms of fantasy, is it ? One of the gang could even be a new Ally with stories of Nuka World and their intense trip over the Wasteland.
---
Nobody cares. ‚Äîeveryone
---
Ah, you did not say gamebreaking, but the person above you that you had responded to said "It's still full of bugs, some of them gamebreaking." My apologies, should have either re-read your statement or responded to them instead.
---
Yeah. I agree. Some people like it though. Idk how
---
Ohio River, if you bring Queen meat you get a better reward and rep. Can be done once a day as well as helping bones with clearing out Mirelurks.
---
I don‚Äôt understand your math, I‚Äôm selling them for 500,  I don‚Äôt buy flux unless I have to but the going rate it 200 caps give or take. I dunno where you got 600 from, but ok.
---
Because bear arms, stim diffuser and formula p are usless and there are better and easier ways of getting XP and legendaries.
---
i was the only one on my server at lode bearing so i just hung out outside after activating the button, you still get the rewards just hiding outside
---
boring AF though, if im active in game id rather be inside pew pewing some miners
---
200 normally?  The Queen has huge DR and takes very little damage.  My lever action is around 200 so I tried it and it does 9 damage per shot to the Queen.  It‚Äôs not a perfect comparison because of the great many variations in perks, stats , legendary effects etc but it‚Äôs a good example.
---
WAIT A MINUTE, THERE'S A WHAT!?
---
*(Haven't played in awhile...)*
---
I'm one of those people and I can tell you right now: not a single thing is going through my mind the entire time other than "Wow I'm so fucking bored" hahaha
---
They've announced that it'll be added sometime in the coming year. Basically it'd work like the Wayward or other interior areas. A separate cell which doesn't need to compete with all the other things on the map for loading and rendering everything else in the game all at the same time. Theoretically, this would mean that budget shouldn't be such an issue, as it's almost like its own isolated little area. Nothing in there would need to be loaded or rendered for anyone except the people who actually enter the area. I'm hoping it doesn't replace the current camp system because I like seeing camps on the map, adding a sense of "rebuilding America" when you see houses built by players. I'd imagine it'll almost be like everyone gets to have their own little bunker or basement area for their camp, like a cellar door where you can further decorate. Of course this is Bethesda we're talking about, so it's anybody's guess how (or if) it'll actually work, or even be added at all.
---
Yea if you log off too late, even tens of seconds before the nuke hits, the system will consider your base nuked and when you back in you‚Äôll see your base has only little frames left. Or if you login too soon AFTER the nuke hits, same result. So what happened to your base is likely a nuke not griefing.
---
Ah slightly disappointed it didn‚Äôt have anything to do with the Shoddycast series Psycho... Still neat though.
---
I agree, I only made my comment because I believe some people are expecting one-for-one returns and they won't be it might be as high as three for one.
---
Really? I bought it for 550 caps. 5-10k seems outrageous.
---
Yeah, we are a great community, minus the few that keep avoiding complete banishment.
---
Other day i saw a guy named raking just starting out from the vault. Gave him a nice auto pipe rifle and a ton of .38 rounds. He wasnt super responsive but appreciative. Maybe even unsure if i was being deceitful.
---
At this point in 76 i got most of what i need and an excellent grip on how to play, helping those just getting started dont bother me
---
I wonder if you need to have a certain rep with the settlers in order for her to spawn. I been server hopping for hours and doing road 81 up and down and no luck. My rep wth the settlers is currently at neutral.
---
It‚Äôs going to be apart of the season that is coming out Tuesday . Btw it‚Äôs free
---
Yea every nuke zone
---
Sure add me! Kmisko
---
Sure! Add me! Kmisko
---
Good on you! I‚Äôm not gonna try and knock you off your pedestal.
---
OMG, YES! I had a scorched level 61, and he was always pissed off. Gave me a headache every time I came home.
---
Me and my team will be on in about 2 hours, but ill add you
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of seasons at all, nothing about this sounds good. I want my daily and weekly atoms back.
---
1 full giddy horse gives 4 screws. There is always 1 at the canned food workshop.
---
Yep I visited an underground camp set up like this the other day (was it yours???)
---
Hilarious experience. Hadn‚Äôt seen the terminal in ground trick before so I had NFI how to get down to the vendors. Camp owner came up and emote guided me in. 
---
Finished with the vendors and there was a massive leap of faith drop spot which I was sure would lead to crippling or death, but landed you safely in water lol. I refused to use it til the camp owner demonstrated that it was safe.
---
10/10 camp experience.
---
Thanx for your help. You were a major help in completing that quest and for that I salute you 
---
https://tenor.com/bc1OJ.gif
---
It‚Äôs not a limited time item...
---
Just keep server hopping at slocum joe‚Äôs and help the settlers when the assault event spawns them as one of the parties, if not them just server hop right away. I did this on and off while I was doing Fasnacht, took me only a few days to fill half of the bar and reach Ally status.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it!
---
They will the same challenges. The issue is that you cannot bulk screws,only springs.
---
Go to camp module and select repair all..
---
You bet.  Thank you for salute. Lol.
---
I found a Fixer plan today for 24,000k and was floored.
---
I‚Äôm hoping that you‚Äôll basically be able to place a door in a CAMP that loads An interior cell.
---
Even better when it‚Äôs a trap base and you die the moment you go underground...
---
I have all serums stocked, about 6-7 of each and sell for 200 a piece.
---
It seems to be a cell like lucky hole mine or other locations that you have to go to through a loading screen. Itll probably have more budget because all it needs to load is that cell and not the whole world around the camp.
---
I get that sometimes. I only team up with my friend and he hasn't played in awhile, yet sometimes it asks if I'd rather go in via team or solo. Only had a problem once when solo didn't work so I had to re-log.
---
Well you can get a good 50 outa the queen, which makes five, if you have team that is helpful you can multiply that by 4 and you get 120 violet which at ten a piece make 12, that doesn‚Äôt add up.
---
&gt; id rather be inside pew pewing some miners
---
this is me.. Im all about XP.. I never want to have any idle time I can avoid
---
That is ridiculous.
---
Okidokie, it's 8:40 where I am and I hop on at 9:30 so I'll make sure to when I'm on. Can't wait to adventure
---
They did have that fish in lamp a while back that was cool and would swim around
---
I kind of love trap camps. Cannot be arsed building one but it fits the vault mentality in my mind. After all those years stuck living on top of one another, you just know pranks were a coping mechanism and that there are gonna be continued hijinks now we‚Äôre out in the world. 
---
Hijinks like creating death houses for all our former friends and colleagues.
---
No, we haven't. We do, however, pay for fallout 1st, etc.
---
Yes I did, thanks didn't realize the game kept rack. Oh well.
---
Yeah, that bit me in the ass before too.
---
Look at this person trying to artificially raise the price for serums.
---
People who purchase cheap serums to resell to robot vendors or in their own machines are dumbasses.
---
For a person who spends 300 to resell at 500 at their own vendor (cause who pays more than 500 for a serum...), they earn only 150. If they sell to robot, they earn 200 but burn 300 potential caps from the vendor's daily pool they could have earned.
---
Dumbasses.
---
Sounds good buddy, see ya then!
---
Not sure, bought it way back when. It's all cosmetic add on I think so up to you really.
---
depends if you exhausted your 1400 caps at the vendors for the day, two runs of Westek WILL give me a level and 1400 caps usually (or 600 steel/run if i scrap).  I used to think selling for less than vendor sucked, but some days you rake in 20,000 caps if you price things right.  I think of it as extra money you couldn't have gotten in that day via normal means.  Yes if you don't feel like running anything for that day, sell 2 to robot vendors.
---
Well, your response to OP wasn't very civil either.  So, you reap what you sow.  Enjoy the downvotes kid.
---
Where did they say anything about fixing the bug? Proof? Link?
---
In my experience everyone shoots her while flying, didn't know this was a thing. Probably too late now to get people to change as the player base is set in its ways.
---
Great use of emotional language...
---
I feel like there probably will. Bethesda has to gimp us somehow.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs real
---
I was thinking about it I could do this, thanks for confirming
---
What doesn‚Äôt add up? I pay nothing for flux. Make serums. Sell serums. Profit. Could I sell to robots? Sure. But that gets boring real quick and you hit daily limit too fast.
---
&gt;No Fasnachts to ruins so they gotta do something.
---
I suppose you're right there, it's a shame though.
---
Come find me with any 3* bows you got
---
Only on fallout 76 PC lmao
---
I do, but I just checked your posts and it looks like you're on xb1. I'm on PS4. Sorry!
---
Ive had this happen idk how they shreded her so quickly. But ive also had tons of level 300s be there and we dont even kill her in time which is embarrassing as fuck. It sucks.
---
Yeah I saw this on a rifle gaming video. He got tons of glowing ghouls
---
I think they're trying, at least. Maybe there's a few bonehead middle management types making things hard for everyone, on top of someone putting tremendous pressure to monetize every inch of the game without providing them with enough resources to keep up with expectations.
---
Well honestly, everything in your CAMP is new stuff you built based on a plan. Realistically, unless you‚Äôre build something out of scrap (like corrugated walls and such) It should be clean at least.   
---
I know they add broken and dirty stuff for immersion, but I wish everything came in ‚Äúdirty‚Äù and ‚Äùnew‚Äù variations.
---
No worries mate.  I appreciate you checking.   Cheers

---
ridicule and derision..
---
&gt; Enjoy the downvotes
---
PSA: fake internet points are fake..
---
Lol quest punishments.
---
Me every time I‚Äôm overweight and can‚Äôt figure out why - it‚Äôs those goddamn missile and nuke quest rewards.
---
If they‚Äôre not going to make the launcher/fat boy into weapons people will actually use, they should just nix them from the game. If my rifle is doing more damage than an actual honest to god nuke, it‚Äôs stupid and immersion-breaking to include them.
---
Nothing. It's likely that'll be it until next season. Other games that have some form of season pass don't implement anything past the end reward. Likely they'll do the same and that'll essentially be it once you hit 100.
---
Add me "jcxcovert":)
---
I respectfully disagree. Lore doesn‚Äôt support it, would be like adding Institute, NCR, Caesar‚Äôs Legion or Minutemen gear to the game.
---
Somebody probably sold them to the vendor prior to you arriving.
---
Took me forever, too. I kept going back and back and finally got it like 3 days into trying every couple of hours once my rage had worn off lol
---
Which is a shame, because I have a 90% reduced weight rocket launcher (plus my bear arms, so it weighs 0.2) specifically for when I find a bag of missiles and get to spend the next 2 mins firing them at anything and everything.
---
Near the cabin at spruce knob.
---
Spruce knob cabin?
---
Aye. this. I hit the 1400 cap cap within a few mins of getting online.
---
What other games give more content after reaching the max season rank ?
---
Buddy!
---
Whitesprings shopping mall. There's a shop there called "Live Chic" (with green walls) manned by an assaultron. She always stocks swimsuits every time I've checked.
---
Thanks again! I just bought the Main game.
---
It is however reward #5 so it hopefully shouldnt be much of a grind. Unknown of course if it will become available for new/returning players that dont play the summer season.
---
But, but, muh tokeeens!?
---
Do you have Weapons Artisan(at 3) ?
---
A must have when you can afford the perk points. Gives you a second damage bar on your weapon...200% fix. Makes such a difference to wear&amp;tear !
---
I'm sorry but there is absolutely no chance you are doing that much damage with a Gauss pistol to the queen.
---
lol i only join events if +3 people are there. unless i activate riding shotgun, easily solo'd
---
Exactly what I'm hoping for. But until they give us more information, I'll be trying not to get my hopes up.
---
Lol, poor lowbie. Now he must think it's the wild wild west a la Red Dead Redemption.
---
love him
---
what are you looking for?
---
Wonder how it completed all of my dailies.
---
Thanks for the confirmation.
---
I run it by myself alot usually just do the venison part and protect the deathclaw it would be nice to have others there to actually get the better rewards but it is what it is
---
There is a chance for one to spawn in the clothing shop just down the hill from the Overseer's house in Sutton. Can also find some up north, SE of the waterpark around a building that used to be a swimming pool I guess. It's a big building with showers and a bunch of sun chairs south of the building.
---
It says I'm linked on Beth, so idk how I could have done it wrong
---
It happened to me as well, I was just leaving vaul 76 and a guy approach me and gave me my first legendary armor and weapons as well a bunch of large gifs
---
It was awesome it helped me to love the game, I can't remember his/her name but I am really grateful
---
Love it. I can get behind this for a tug or two.
---
I felt bad. Some level 175 randomly shooting at him.
---
Why can't you be on PC?!? But good on you for helping folks
---
Hey, as long as you can maintain the killing-times, enjoy the loot! :)
---
[https://imgur.com/a/TtRVgvh](https://imgur.com/a/TtRVgvh)
---
There's so many. I've had a few 3 Stars spawn at least.
---
Hope things are looking up for you. Wait until you launch your first nuke and kill your first scorch beast queen!
---
Set you recording setting to 10 minutes and use photo mode
---
i currently have a broken hand so i'v been controller bound since i cant hit all the keys efficiently, didn't have to try make it seem as though a controller = handicapped mode.
---
controllers are nearly as good as a keyboard and mouse, sure the turn rates and precision is not up to par but the comfort factor is through the roof.
---
but hey man you keep being you, life sucks and we all die, if you wanna have people think of you as an asshole you keep going, your life and whatnot, i just thought people would have a laugh at my buggy moment.
---
I actually like legendary farming but only bc I have a lot of ways I do it (several different events, locations, etc.) and I don‚Äôt have much to do since I completed the main story
---
I remember when I was about level 16 some level 300 gave me 600+ duped presents. Needless to say I was rich. I only used 200, sold around 300 for 100 caps (each), and gave 50 to 2 level 20 players. I still have 23 and I always keep a present in my display just to remember.
---
Base damage is not the same as damage done to the queen. How much damage were you actually doing  per hit? because I can tell you right now, it wasn't anywhere near 277.
---
Make mule characters
---
Welcome, hope you're able to find one soon! Happy hunting!
---
can we get a rad-gorrilla named Radi-Kong as the server boss?
---
What‚Äôs the best way to transfer caps from one toon to another?
---
In 5 years when emulation is strong enough, we will have it.
---
I've read about this bug a few times now. It should also stop if you log out and come back in.
---
Thank you all for replying. I'll start out about 8k and lower it as time goes on. I got 2 of them playing last week, but I'm not really interested in it so I gave one to a friend who collects all the plans. I generally give away cosmetic plans and recipes to whomever needs them. I have a free vendor at my camp that I restock constantly.
---
Really? I thought if anything the game would get forgotten in a few years and then the servers would get shut down and I got really sad. But maybe Bethesda will make the game better and get rid of some of the bugs that have always been around. Fingers crossed!
---
this, would be so awesome just ft to finish those
---
Omg really?? Love that for us lmao 
---
I plan on visiting WV to see my heritage, thanks for the heads up lol
---
A turret shot ATHENA through a window in my house, while she was following Sophie around.

By the time I got outside to despawn the turret, half my house's right side was damaged or destroyed from her eye laser.
---
We'd get sick
---
Did you try the Shopping Mall Vendor at Whitesprings? He is the bot tucked a little out of view toward the end of the row of shops on the right. Theres the Mr handy bot thats visible and sells only "jewelery" type junk items and then around the corner is the Shopping Mall Bot that sells a bunch of CAMP type plans and other stuff. You may have to keep trying a few times because they dont always carry some of them. He would be a better one to keep trying though because the one at Harpers has a much larger stock list and I think some things just get pushed right to the bottom and outside its display capabilitities
---
Can't bulk screws but you can buy them at a robot vendor.  Currently looking at bulk screws for sale at R&amp;G station.  He has 5 of them for 180 each without hard bargain at 20 charisma.
---
Play that monkey music rad boy?
---
You sound like a trump cultists
---
I buy serum recipes, PA plans, just big ticket items, and always the gold bullion each week. 
---
Now when I run out of those sinks... who  knows!
---
160, 182, 69, and 55. Why?
---
It cannot be possible, the raiders took control of Nuka-World a year before the arrival of the sole survivor, before it was a caravan center
---
Also wondering what tab "bulk screws" falls under?
---
Just a normal day at school, lol.
---
I think it can happen with anything. I had it happen with Super Mutants. Mongrel Dogs, Molerats.. no idea why.
---
If I know anything about this game. It will be a let down and the grind for it will be so horribly dull after a week
---
Options are limited. Friends or second account. Fallout 1st.
---
I use a second account. Bought a second copy of the game from Amazon. Less than 20 dollars.
---
It is unlockable at rank 5 of the season so I don‚Äôt think it will take that long
---
Sounds like it thinks you don't own the items for some reason... Have you tried closing out the game and relaunching it so it signs back into Bethesda?
---
Talking about using the machine long term. Tokens that give a small amount of ammo I return for giving a huge amount of ammo.
---
You need your Damage numbers turned on to see a realtime amount of damage. Also be aware that she is practically immune to explosives these days so you may not be pumping out quite the damage you think you are.
---
Do you have enough materials to build it?
---
Considering I have over 600 treasury notes they're worth even less than the 30 caps it takes to get to SE.  And I'm at the cap limit so caps mean basically nothing too.
---
Do you have enough materials to build?
---
I like some of the skins. Especially the Gatling gun.
---
I wouldn't rely on the wiki as it's mostly out of date. You're best bet is server hopping the Whitespring. For some weird reason despite vendors being patched to stock all their plans frequently some are missing.
---
 I've actually gone in there since I started writing this and that plan is in there.
---
My underground one is a night club with only one trap ! A fake door with a wall behind
---
Just you
---
It's not always bad to shoot her in the air, it's only certain very small windows of time between  her animations that can cause her to not land.
---
Vendors inventory can vary by server based on what other players buy, so server hopping might help you
---
I thought it was a new faction, which I'd love to start.
---
Private servers are completely new server instances.  If you encounter an area that looks like it has been picked clean, then it is due to how world loot works in the game not due to someone else already looting the place.
---
Farming a specific resource in a specific area requires you to loot 180 different world items before they can appear again in that location.  So if you farm for Ultracite Ore in Glassed Caverns or Microscopes in Ella Ame's Bunker and Morgantown High School, then you have to loot 180 world items in order to be able to farm those locations again.  It requires looting 60 containers in order for the previously looted containers to be refreshed.  
---
This applies to the public server as well, but there is no way to know if a loot item is missing due to another player or the loot system.
---
Oh? I haven't done Mr Messenger too many times, maybe 5 or 6 total and the liberators were the only times he turned against me. Good to know though, thank you!
---
I think it's 79 or 89 that's the blood eagles skin for the hand made and I'm excited for that along while the ghillie armor skins all the what through is pretty cool
---
I have not! Didn‚Äôt see him. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I hit every other vendor in WS though. Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely check there.
---
Tho not as bad as encrypted or as boring as feed the people, project paradise is actually a fun event. But somebody always has to break the ice.
---
They weight 0.1 pounds each and you need 100 for the big reward, so most of 10 pounds wasted saving up.  I've gotten nothing worth mentioning from the big reward.
---
He gets overlooked easily but he is listed on the wiki as being the source for the plan so good luck.
---
I have about 500 weapons and 500 armor on my mules. Anyone below 200 i ask what they are looking for and offer 2 weapons and a suit of armor for free. Making the wastelands great again.
---
Most of it is okay, the scrip/caps/bullion/supply crates and lunchboxes are just filler. And the separating of the armor skins to each set to pad it out even more is what irks me. I feel very whelmed by most of it.
---
If this became too big of a mission for Beth my idea suggests that either furniture with clutter on already or maybe different clutter combos already mixed up and ready to be placed. 
---
Imagine a sort of  invisible ‚Äúrug‚Äù with clutter on it. 
---
If that makes sense to you.
---
But really, Beth is good to design the game imo. So if they just added furniture with clutter on or around them I would be happy also. 
---
Edit: or even make more furniture like displays and make junk items placeable on them
---
Well it is a nuke landing on a bunch of wood and bricks.
---
However, going forward;
---
Go to the C.A.M.P. module - its the thing you placed to choose you location, looks like a little unfolding tool table.
---
There's an option to repair all. If you have the available materials you can do this. If not, go farm the needed materials, and do this. This will restore your base to it's former glory.
---
When ever the warning comes up "XXXX has launched a nuke!" And the "Death from above" mission prompt appears check the map to see if your camp is going to be under the nuke zone. If it is, log off, wait 3 mins (so you dont accidentally load back onto the same server) and log in again.
---
Would recommend not building your camp anywhere that people like to nuke (whitesprings, fissure site prime), and if you really want the area around vault 76 is un-nukeable.
---
Yes, this. I was actually impressed they put so many skins on that chart!
---
Okay?
---
You guys are great. I didn't realize I was lacking the materials to build. I assumed that once I bought the set everything I needed was included. Thanks!!!!
---
Yup... Was with the Super Mutants I figured out that if you run far enough away when he's aggroed, he will reset or something back to non-hostile and you can run back to continue on to his destination.
---
No worries. Both the Freestates and shopping mall vendor have it.
---
I want a crocolossus mascot costume too! Crocolossus suit+Flamethrower= make shift kaiju costume. lol
---
Oh! Did he keep going hostile every attack wave with the super mutants as well?
---
Then explain everyhing they got in from far harbor.As someone mentioned it doesnt have to be called disciple,operator,pack armor they can just rename it and alter it a bit.Fo76 isnt lore friendly to begin with...
---
Ps: NCR armor is in the game
---
That would be bad how?
---
Oh no... miss out on... seasons!
---
Ammo? Converter?
---
Their stock is the same as long as the server is up. Server hopping will give you a chance at different items.
---
Cause that‚Äôs a joke, I‚Äôm level 550, so you dunno what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
I'll be sure to look you up next time I'm on thank you
---
me too. just the ammo converter.
---
I've heard her minions also count towards the 1k
---
One word - Sheepsquatch
---
OK, maybe just one more - Plushy!
---
I think there's something up above L90 I saw that tempted me but I'm in no hurry to get there m
---
It's literally broken though, bugged, not "ugh that build is so powerful it's broken". The bug causes weapons to ramp their damage so they do a few thousand more DPS than intended.
---
The scrap bin was the main reason why I succumbed to Fallout 1st.  More and more of the Stash Box is taken up by Junk instead of valuable items.  The ammo converter will help reduce my worries with the Stash Box.  Mini Nukes and Missiles will finally be worth something instead of another thing to avoid like the plague.
---
So after 800 hours I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about? Ok. How many hours do I need to put into the game to be able to know what I am talking about?
---
Thanks, this advise will help me aswell
---
Getting? It has always been abusive to its participants boi. The great nerfing. The great amount of bugs that often result in wasted time/lost god roll and legacy items. The horrible RNG. The lack of endgame content. No, the bullion grind is not *content.* it‚Äôs a grind. About 6 hours of not even remotely challenging play? Delayed by four months? And it was glitchy as fuck anyway? Not acceptable. Shutting down vendors for nearly two months. Not acceptable. All this bullshit is why many people have quit, and it‚Äôs always been abusive.
---
Plans
---
There's a good few things on that list am looking forward to getting the ammo convertor though I've got like 3k of. 38 ammo I don't need plus good knows how many arrows etc...

Am looking forward to scraping them üòÇ

Not that I can remember. Was in the Mire after like 2 waves, he got mad at me and I got frustrating thinking it was ruined again, but cleared out the stranglers for their XP and started to run away. The noticed his red dot went away from my compass, so ran back and he was floating on like nothing happened.
---
There isn't really a good way to find him as far as I'm aware. My camp is across from thetrain station near top of the world and he seems to pass there semi frequently. You could try that
---
It's a very small community.  Be kind to those 10 whales keeping the servers running.
---
I think is one of the nice events we got but it is underappreciated. It only takes three players to do which is not much and it awards 4 Treasury Notes and possibly other cool plans.  
---
And if you have a good build is not even hard. People just need to know what to do instead of everyone working on Biome A (seen it a lot)
---
Are they still supporting the free linking?
---
Ok, I'll have to be more mindful in the future, thanks for info!
---
1700 hours, so you half half as much experience as I do. You just started over probably don‚Äôt even have a proper build.  Bet you were wishing two shot weapons were still OP.
---
Same. I heard him talking in Charleston but couldn‚Äôt find him.
---
There was a datamine in wich they found the convertion rates and the max amount you can convert (i guess the max amount is the daily cap)
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm gonna disregard everything you say. Because you don‚Äôt seem qualified
---
I used to find him a lot near Gauley Mine but even that has been a fail lately for me. Thanks for the tip. Ill try there
---
Most people can't tell between a OHK and a five second LMG burst killing her. All they notice is she had a lot of health, and now shes dead. I ended a wayyy too long SBQ fight with a JFFR LMG the other day and the comments were mixed between "someone's got a magic weapon" and "who one shotted her". Nobody was mad though, because they all got more than enough in to get loot and the quest was going to fail soon anyway.
---
What do you play on?
---
Is this kind of like Dungeons and Dragons where one person will set up a 'mission' of sorts. Then everybody rps leading up to the mission and going through it?
---
In this case, some people might play the rolls of the 'bad guys' and put on costumes like enclave armor and stuff and fight the main party. Basically, I am thinking kind of like LARPing but in fallout.
---
Lol. Nice troll. It‚Äôs interesting how upset you get when people disagree with you. I get by just fine pricing things the way I want to price them. But thanks for the psa and insults. Have a nice day.
---
I will allow it.
---
How many hours does one need to be qualified?
---
Lovely story. A similar thing happened to me: someone made me the full set of XO1 power armor when I was starting the game. It was the best gift ever! Now I help whenever I can. Note: your ammo supply won't be enough and will end soon (hopefully, because you'll be having fun) LOL.
---
Good enough for me
---
Like I said I nuked it so
---
even though they are all ghillie, im excited to get paints for every armor type now,  hopefully it will cut back on the accidental sales/scriping of peoples armor
---
I see way more of the Travelling Responder Vendor Bot now than I do Grahm. I feel like something is diminishing his spawns, probably the new NPCs since Wastelanders
---
ü§£ dude you attacked me. Don‚Äôt back track now
---
Yeah. I think it's the same with any horde event. Don't kill the boss and more enemies turn up. Sometimes legendaries.
---
So far i know it works on yogi bears, gulpers, super mutants, fog crawlers, ghouls and mole rats (done them past few days and just done fog crawlers). Hardest part is not killing the boss when you're trying to murder its pals.
---
Like I said I‚Äôm sorry I nuked the shit outta it man. Had to blow the bitch up into pixels
---
I didn‚Äôt want to risk that, I just uninstalled it and am going to reinstall. I appreciate your help
---
Imma do that thanks. U get all of your progress back it you reinstall right?
---
Where did I attack you?
---
Bank your caps into mules.
---
Buy all the plans and recipes and learn them
---
Buy bulk flux
---
Buy bulk ammo
---
Buy expensive legendaries
---
When in season:
---
Buy ornate pails
---
Buy large handmade present wrapping paper

Ironically, it was probably the ropey start that FO76 had that caused this.
---
All the griefers that do it because of boredom couldnt be bothered to play past the initial bugs, and all the "cool" kiddies that think shooting up other people's bases makes them edgy wouldnt be caught dead playing 76 because some guy on youtube said it was lame.
---
What was left was the people who actually wanted to play it, and they were more than happy to ofload their spare stuff onto a new player (particularly back in the days before vendors when spare plans did nothing but weigh you down)
---
Try killing it with explosive bait.
---
Found him walking through Flatwoods earlier. Was on my level 5 nub lol. Just about had enough caps for the starburst clock plans.
---
I was doing that for a bit and then I kind of started to hold back and if I really needed to drop off a serum on a robot vender then I would do it.
---
You get a ton of stuff inside the mine -- XP for killing mole miners, all their shotguns/gauntlets for selling/scrapping, tons of crafting materials in the green boxes and the "troves"... definitely worth going inside.
---
That was my point - I've seen games that have quite low FPS because they do not seem to utilize the CPU and GPU properly and waste 20% of the time with idling (or just I/O). Fallout 76 does not seem to do it, which makes it especially odd, since it ran just fine before, so what is it doing differently now? Also, if OP is getting poor FPS and their utilization was way less than 100%, we could infer that the game does not respect the refresh rate - and in that case there would be at least some possibilities to fix it. But if it utilizes the GPU properly and still performs poorly with low settings, then it's the same mystery that I'm experiencing at the moment...
---
And then there us that sadly give up and  play less and less, and just fade.
---
I make any from 20 to 40 serums a night from queen runs I sell everything from marsupial and even twisted muscles at 225 a serum I usally sell about 20 to 30 of the ones I make which easily bypass the vendor bot caps. I dont see the point since when I sell to the vendor the most I can sell is 2.
---
\*runs up to vendor, sees empty tag, everything that was in the vendor is on the ground instead\*
---
The issue with the one at Harpers is I think it has a huge stock list that extends beyond the number of items it can display for sale so some things just get pushed to the bottom of the list and doesnt seem to rotate into the visible spot. As others have suggested, try the one at White springs. If you dont know where the Free States one is, he is next to an Assaultron in one of the "beauty salon" shops on the right hand side
---
It‚Äôs funny you mention it. I recently learned that you have to hit her about 10k damage before you get loot. But when these guys are around I barely get to that point, even when I‚Äôm there from the very beginning. 
---
I still get the treasury notes ofc. But that legendary roll would have been nice too. 
---
And these guys could even save ammo by not burning her to the ground you could argue. 
---
But yeah I guess the way that things drop could be done differently as well so this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Maybe make it so it‚Äôs based on time. This way, even tho someone afk‚Äôs, they‚Äôll have to use all their time at the event anyway. So why not do it and gain some extra exp for killing as well.
---
This one was easy at least, cuz it was stuck in a wall and I couldn't kill it. so.. kinda bummed I couldn't but I got bored after killing 78 yao guai. Their meat weighs a lot.. lol.
---
You've totally got the right of it, it's like larping, in fallout. And it is really, really fun.
---
We even have a pen and paper style dice resolution system for things the game won't let us do. For instance, in our session today one of our players wanted to try to talk their way out of a situation with a lie, so the player had to roll a charisma check, versus an opposed perception check.
---
Why that is a hell of an idea.
---
You know you get like 8 free pure flux per queen right?
---
Rule 10
---
For me crunchy definitely gives +5 Charisma because it makes very very happy and 25% faster fire rate because i get electric.
---
So I generally buff my bloodied ffr 50 cal to high 300s low 400s per shot. Headshots on sbq do no more than about 110 per, much lower if I hit her anywhere else or my health is above 20%. Queen has very effective damage mitigation
---
I honestly think it's worth doing 99 levels just for the secret fireplace door.
---
You'll be surprised, there are sellers that make 10 k a month according to a you tuber.
---
My CAMP is between The Wayward and Flatwoods and he used to be more common to see strolling past for me but I cant remember the last time Ive seen him go past. I must just be unlucky
---
Whose to say that you didn't refinish the woodwork? Reupholster the furniture with radstag or yao guai, even rabbit if you like. Brahmin hide is everywhere ya know. It seems to me that for immersion, a set of ornate wooden stairs seems more realistic than brand new vault, Nuka Cola, or Red Rocket stairs. I mean you start out with nothing and you find wood. Lots and lots of wood and all the time left in the world. You can build a castle with all that wood!! So yeah, I think clean wooden furniture furniture is definitely immersion.
---
Every day around 12pm est I believe
---
You said no new content. You have been corrected.
---
Really? I‚Äôve never seen the event failed.
---
Server stability is much better now, though it's still not perfect. The SBQ event is also much less laggy, and you don't have to wait forever for the loot to show up. The game definitely has gotten better.
---
Yeah lol, I'm around level 25 and I already have purifiers, so whenever I see newbies I just drop a shit load of water and spam the heart emote
---
Wrong sub
---
To me the highlights are:
---
Ammo converter
---
Lunchboxes
---
Cosmetics from the last 10 levels
---
I'll definitely be "pew pewing" from now on
---
I heard the only reason everyone is so nice is because there‚Äôs no proper way to be a raider
---
I still have nightmares from the mole miner scavenger event
---
It was probably destroyed between the last time you were at camp and when you logged out last time you played.
---
Probably by people using the bugged weapon that damages camps.
---
Either that or your client froze when logging out and your camp persisted in the world for a few minutes and the above happened (or it was nuked if in a nukable area).
---
I've also had it happened where the vending machines just simply don't load and I have to fast travel to their base a second time. So that's fun.
---
Xbone. Gamertag is CensorErikii
---
Gilman Lumbermill (south of vault 76) is a great place for farming wood. The enemies are just weak ticks that you can kill. Make sure to click on every log that is on the floor as well as every pile of wood. You should be able to get 70-100 wood from just one run.
---
It gives me wood just thinking about it.
---
Funniest place I've found him is inside the truck trailer outside Hemlock Holes Maintenance. I could hear him rambling on from outside.
---
With patch 20 (June 30th) they will introduce Seasons, wich is like a pattle pass. There are 100 tiers to it and the reward for the 3rd one is an ammo converter. You'll sell ammo and get points which you can use to buy more ammo.
---
I think that's where I'm going.
---
When I started the game, I honestly thought legendary modules would give your weapon a random legendary effect. I thought it was brilliant! Sure, to get a 3 star legendary weapon with the right effects would be hard. Every additional effect would have a high chance of not being what you want, and thus making you have to restart from scratch.
---
Then I found out the truth... and it's made all the other great content less appealing. Why go farm screws, go launch nukes, when I have a next to no chance of ever getting a weapon that I truly want.
---
The PTS had it and it was removed from there for them to make changes
---
When you approach a camp that your client hasn't loaded yet that has broken items they explode for you after the camp loads in.
---
Crocosaurus vs. Mr. Fuzzy...the greatest DLC ever!
---
I agree, I love fallout 76 and the community especially. I just look past some of the issues and have fun in the wasteland
---
- Lots of videos listing the games OBJECTIVE problems are not subjective. That's not how facts work. Facts are not up for debate and differ person to person. 
---
- I have played the game. I sunk 16 hours into it after Wastelanders and quit and refunded because I have higher standards and did not have the tolerance to ignore the problems I listed. Like a lot of people. 
---
- People not worrying about the issues doesn't mean they don't exist and other people do
---
- Really tired of the "youtubers ruined the game because they just lie and blow up the games problems" BS fans use 
---
- Pretty much nothing on the internet matters of course. 
---
- Almost everything I described is an objective issue with the game that does not change when you play it and how much they bother you depends on your personal tolerance levels and standards. Of course thats the experience of loads of people who have played the game? The only ones left playing are those who can tolerate those problems. Everyone else quit. Hence why the numbers have dropped significantly? And why there's almost constant threads on the forums and reddit complaining about those aspects and others?
---
- A person's experience does not change objective problems. It is incredibly easy to look at for example some of the problems I listed and usually decide "Hey I can probably look past that stuff and enjoy it" or "nah a lot of that sounds pretty deal breaking to me". Physically pressing WASD and left mouse clicking does not magically wipe away the games problems. 
---
- I completely get what you're trying to argue it's the only line of defence for the game I ever hear. "All the youtube videos about the games problems are lies" "You have to PLAY THE GAME" "The only haters of the game just haven't played it because its so amazing" "those evil youtubers ruined the game by lying about its issues for clicks even while they're reporting accurate factual information" "I won't give you a source for how I know everyone who dislikes the game hasnt played it or link a video which shows a popular youtuber lying but trust me its real because I'm right and you're wrong!" etc etc. It's sad. So sad.
---
I don't understand what your point is? You got the rewards, correct?
---
I sent you a PM! Hope to see you in the wasteland friend!
---
Same. Im PA main, so all the ghille skins for regular armor dont interest me. The red-yellow PA skins look awkward as hell (walking mcdonalds maskot?). And while the lvl 100 spacesuit looks well made, its not for me either, too goofy.
---
So, nothing in the season for me at all too...
---
People are so nice BECAUSE there's no raiders. Griefing antagonistic jerks make good people stop playing.
---
They definitely are worth 4 as long as you get them.
---
If players are ending it so fast, they're usually running all 3 to get 12 Treasury Notes.
---
If you want to do magic damage too, try an Accelerated Minigun with the 'magic effects' documented in the Angry Turtle video
---
The very fact that me saying that I am gonna sell my serums for 500 caps made you respond in a way that insinuated that I was wrong or not wanting to get hosed and my reason for raising my prices were invalid.  You could have don‚Äôt a lot of things; but what you did do is try and have a lengthy argument with me over my view of serum prices. I say you‚Äôre not qualified because you don‚Äôt remember when serums cost more than 1k, I asked you what your level was to see if you even understood what happened before the first dupe glitch. You don‚Äôt, and that makes you unqualified to say anything other wise. Because my first serum cost me 1500 caps. The. People started duping and they went down to 200, with all the complaining about duping in this subreddit,  if you had been on this fame from the start you would get it. So I ask you your level. To see if you‚Äôve actually been around long enough to see the trends ( I didn‚Äôt even ask you if you trade on the subreddit) I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs why you aren‚Äôt qualified to say shit. I‚Äôve been here since beta, I was one of the first ‚Äúshopkeepers‚Äù on this game until the put out vending machines. You don‚Äôt have a stone to stand on. So beat feet
---
Not saying you can farm every horde in the game for the entire timer.... I'm not saying that at all
---
It's not with the SBQ, it doesn't matter what the target is. It basically taps into an uncapped version of Furious.
---
Lower level players may think you aren't friendly. I mostly drop low level weapons that I craft specifically for them, as well as ca. 10 stimpaks and some armor and some spare plans.
---
Not really baffling considering fo76 was made by morons.
---
Bog area was always enough for my purposes.
---
Just tame something else. You can only have one pet.
---
It might be the same case as with junkies. People having addictions on purpose
---
At no point did I attack you... all I said was I sell for way cheaper and get by just fine. 
---
Again... where did I attack you?
---
One of us posting walls of texts. One of us is asking simple questions.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since November 2018. How many hours do I need to be qualified?
---
You can repair your entire camp via the C.A.M.P. device.
---
I get that. Not saying it‚Äôs not worth going inside. But if the event is on and you want to hit the can or throw a pizza in the oven, it‚Äôs a great place to kill some time.
---
It would be interesting if you could create "Bulk Ammo Scrap" out of excess ammo and scrap it for supplied
---
I agree with your take on participation.
---
But since when is the power-plant reward dependent on the percentage? Last I looked you had to do the event 3 times to get the fusion generator, no matter what.
---
I'm still having flashbacks of One More Pils.
---
Hard to believe. There ain't a modern online game with big issues these days and people can usually agree with the issues, but still the community turns into shit(I am looking at you The Division 2 and DayZ for example).
---
But I think it's the franchise that keeps us together. Most of us have a history with Fallout before it went online and even before it was mediocre(4) and that history is deep. This history and love that we share to this franchise keeps us together, not Beths mistakes. 
---
Those mistakes have actually shattered the community, but most of the people that could not handle those are gone. Maybe they did not share our history or seeing the history compared to this day just hurt them too much.
---
So I think Beths mistakes hurt the community, but the franchise keeps us together. There is a limit thou and usually we just fade away.
---
To be honest I have no idea. I don‚Äôt think so simply because you‚Äôre damaging another enemy, not the queen herself. I could be wrong.
---
Since you don‚Äôt seem to know what the hell your talking about,  many more hours than you have
---
Sorry, I've never seen it before or heard about it. That post was mine
---
I cam across some sort of agility challenge the other day. Spent a good hour trying to complete it, never managed to do so. I loved it, and the moment I get a jet-pack I would love to go back and complete it, if I'm still playing the game.
---
Its somewhere halfway between the Wayward and the overseer's house, not marked on the map.
---
So I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about because I disagree with you?
---
It's just kind of frustrating... To have to spend all that time doing the event for the person who just spent all time standing there go, walk to the terminal, and finnish it without even letting me 100%.
---
I could've just rushed and finnished the event without the optional goals, but I took more time to completely finnish it, and they didn't give me the chance to. 
---
It might be silly, but it mattered at the time.
---
I will add you next time I'm on!
---
Thanks! Glad you find it useful
---
I didn‚Äôt get it. Can you sent it again?
---
He‚Äôs probably still going to keep it until he‚Äôs level 50 then realize it‚Äôs junk that late in the game
---
I prefer to boil them, mash them or put them in a stew.
---
That is an intersting theory. I will definitely try that when I get mine.
---
He -could- be, but I agree it is unlikely. 
---
My sneak bloodied command does 200 to the queen headshot with a BE handmade and that‚Äôs not even on the top end of what players can do.
---
once time he came to fort defiance while the event ‚ÄúLine in the Sand‚Äù was active. haha
---
if you just said..
---
&gt; i currently have a broken hand so i'v been controller bound since i cant hit all the keys efficiently, controllers are nearly as good as a keyboard and mouse, sure the turn rates and precision is not up to par but the comfort factor is through the roof.
---
instead of insulting me.. maybe someone would have paid attention to something other than me in your own thread..
---
I just play them as they lay...
---
also..  sweet not calling me an asshole... but calling me an asshole.. nice passive aggressive jab there.. way to keep it classy
---
Oh, thanks! Didn't notice.
---
And yeah, Im a gat plasma user and would love having that option there.
---
Congrats. Wait till you meet the Wendigo.
---
Stuff of nightmares.
---
So you built your camp on top of an existing building? How did you manage that? I can‚Äôt even place a fence over a small pebble on the ground. And the 4 staircases made from suitcases didn‚Äôt put you over budget?! Crazy!
---
5th, actually
---
Uh? Whats a pied piper eyebot?
---
Did he join in the fight?
---
It'd be awesome if they set up each table and desk like the Distinguished Guests tables, where you need up to 4 plates, 4 forks, 4 knives...etc and as you add them to the item in the CAMP building mode, the items appear as permanent items on the table/desk.
---
now they have something to work towards at least
---
i wish. he kind of just stood by the sonic generator being useless. lol
---
lol...ok ill add "check truck trailers" to the list. I think he does the circuits of the workshops from what Ive read so maybe I should just try hanging near one somewhere
---
Then I didn't know that, and it's my bad. 
---
Even if I wouldn't have gotten the fusion generator, I assumed like most games I've played, that completing optional things would still get you a better reward still (like as in the other items you get, their quality and quantity) as in Fasnatch, where keeping alive more robots would give you chances to better rewards.
---
I probably should check if it truly works like that tho.
---
Talk about a care package lol
---
Great job on looking out for other players
---
I don't think I've actually seen this. I only keep seeing the annoying morse code eyebot instead.
---
...which I promptly kill, because the morse code noises irritate my ears.
---
Yeah it hit me today and I can say I had fun doing them but it is a bit old.  Anyway I get people‚Äôs concern about Atoms, I was just thinking game time a bit.  Anyway just a bit of reflection
---
Just had the same problem. I went to the Whitesprings resort and bought a lot of camp plans. spent 10k caps there
---
I like the secret passageway i forgot what level it was I think 90+
---
lol..pity because he is unkillable.
---
Ammo isn't really an issue so not particularly.  It'll be a nice convenience but I'm sort of curious how much camp budge it will take up.
---
