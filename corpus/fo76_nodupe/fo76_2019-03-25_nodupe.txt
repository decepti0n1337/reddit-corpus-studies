Noticed the same thing recently. Found a nice Junkies 3* so went about trying to get addicted. Finally did it, died and it was all for nought. Back to my instigating build.

---
take your own advice and server hop than dude no point directing real world hate at some people enjoying a product they paid for and yknow Bethesda has said its feature not a bug, so uh good luck.
---
Walk behind the robots and push them when they stop.  You can push 'em right through a parked power armor if you push hard enough.
---
Maybe try on a new server. Might have been a higher level player on incognito nearby.
---
Yes. Every time I try to initiate trade with another player, it either gets stuck on "Waiting for X" or they will run the other direction when I approach them, or if I can open a trade they close it and run.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So Ive declared the in game Vendors as the only reliable source for trades.
---
Give it a shot. You'd be surprised.
---
Also, maybe give it a few server hops. In some places if a high level goes through an area before you, everything will respawn higher level. The Sons Of Dane Compound (which you visit during that quest) is one of those areas. 
---
The Brotherhood Forbidden Knowledge quest often gives legendary combat armor alongside BOS power armor paints. Though, its normally Chameleon and Life Saving from my experience 
---
Last time I checked they were bugged. Dont know if they fixed it or not yet. 2 of the same kind will produce at the rate of just having one. I was getting way more water from just making one of each kind vs 3 large.
---
The pics are from this reddit and you can type fallout 76 four horsemen paints on Google. It will show you the info needed. Not sure about any effects. Yesterday I even saw pics of a stolen backpack being used from the developers room that gives more carry weight. I don't condone stealing from there but now that the info is out what can you do but share. Gives us something we can save atom points for.
---
^also, it was super nice out this weekend. Something, something, spring has spring, something, something, end of winter?
---
Ps4, definitely seeing it when doing the new event.  Not dcs, but 2-3 minutes to get event in the log, turn ins not accepting, steins not picking up, and marchers freezing.
---
I have version one of the Xbox one, which I got on day one. Runs fallout 76 and RD2 with no problems.
---
I always go to Vault 76. Turning right, and go down the stairs. There‘s a bus. Inside the Bus there’s a Suitcase and a Medicit. I always put the stuff in the Suitcase, switch character and collect everything. Had never any problems so far.
---
It’s as true as the fact that turning off your console/pc will fill your inventory with good loot. If you don’t believe me, try it. It may take a few times, as the window to perform this action is quite small.

You can see Watoga landmarks in the picture, just line yourself up with those and walk to the cliffs.

I looked at that yesterday and we were saying "maybe with that catapult trick you could get up there from seneca rocks" I guess you showed I was right (assuming thats how you got there)
---
You must be new to the fallout community.... some one on this thread will post that they finnaly got the mask in 2025. Its a dedicated group.

Oh I didnt see that one. I saw one that said that we should try letting some die but IDK.
---
One person can kill all the wolves and sting wings - use a Tesla rifle.  That’s how I deal with them.
---
There are a few. but if you need any help let me know :) 
---
Agree completely. I would love to spend money on a game i actually enjoy. But Bethesda is not rly giving me any options for that xD HEY BETHESDA! I WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON A NICE RADTOAD ARMOR SET!! SO I CAN SCARE OTHER GUYS!
---
Are you talking about wrecking ball?  I searched for the perk card that you referenced and that’s the closest card I could find.  I’m not outraged, but I am trying to understand what is and isn’t griefing.  So far, nothing is griefing unless you follow someone to a new server, which is actually harassment, so idk.
---
but i thought this game was dead?   /s
---
No, it’s all RNG, because the reward is always worse when the robots are dead. I know people who have done the events 50 times and still haven’t gotten any rare masks with all robots surviving, whereas I got the beret on my third try, again with all robots surviving.
---

xD with or without /s ...there is a lot of new people on ps4, hell its hard to find a spot right now in places that use to be empty.. When they start farming at my scorchbeast spot i will get rly angry xD
---
Theres the holotape from the guy stuck in the mines after a tremor (or maybe the bombs dropping caused a tremor) who made a holotape for his wife if they ever find him, thats pretty sad
---
Centaur
---
Nope
---
The only explosive weapon i got is Flamer, at least it's unattainable now so i guess it counts as somewhat legendary. Yet to see any Two Shot myself
---
Tks!!!
---
I got this same drop but I didn't put the scorch killer mod on it. It's my primary sniper weapon. Get your rifleman perks and it's a beast.
---
No problem!
---
To get into an other event. Max I've had to server hop was 3 times. So 54 is an utter overexaggeration.

Ooooh do it!  Live to see it happen. With all the caos it would be hard

Just run in grab it and run out 
---
Can you drop them for other players?
---
Nice but looks like some guys beat your chick up
---
But still possible if u are melee...too bad she often sits on my head ;/
---
I think there is a bug, every time i login i have to go to the audio settings and raise the chat slider up. Each time it is set at zero. Has anyone else notice this?  I'm on ps4 
---
You can't even sell in-game objects that have atomic shop skins (like painted armor). The skins have to be removed before selling or trading 
---
You gave me a 90's flash back lol Battletoads the game. Now I will forever think battletoad instead or radtoads now haha.

I keep getting chased by mirelurk kings in wendigo cave i find myself screaming

That would be cool...
---
I recently joined in late with a few low levels running the event one robot was dead and I got a beret. Then another time two robots were dead an I got a beret again. So I didnt know if this confirmed ot or what probably jusy dumb luck
---
Nope. Normally it blocks you from; trading, dropping onto the ground/into a box. Only occasionally theyll make an oopsy and an object doesn't follow the normal rules but then you have a short till it's patched ie; glitch the paint PA skins for other people (patched), red kitchen stove can be built in other people's camps (not patched).
---
nope. self-destructs.
---
Yeah just noticed more posts with way better shots. Im giving up trying, wasted too many nades and mines trying to get myself killed and revived inside the wall
---
Like with a poof of confetti?
---
The glowing sea radioactivity is mainly from a nuclear reactor that melted down after a bomb hit nearby, which is why it’s so radioactive.
---
im on xbox and have noticed a huge influx of noobies as well , im glad to see the game getting new people
---
What makes you so sure?
---
Ha yeah. I always seem to end up there too. I wonder if your alone if she could be pacified. 
---
nah just vanishes.
---
Sorry typo, Boris what I meant
---
New event: "panic at the disco" or "Halloween ball massacre"
---
Nah just would take a little commitment would have to spend the whole battle in a pose and wait for the right moment 
---
So you can test it. Try to drop it on the ground, if it comes up with a box to say "you will delete this object", you cannot trade. If it works, great. I hope youre on ps4
---
Please be aware that most of the people are saying that F4 is bad...wait F3 is also bad.. but again please be aware there were people who hated on Tactics for being different.  THIS IS PERFECT post apocalypse... NO HUMAN NPC! they are dead! robot npc are fine...
---
I had this theory. Both times I got a beret, I was the first one there, started the event, found all 5 bots, and completed a majority of the tasks myself.
---
Most likely a huge part of it was dumb luck, however I have noticed that players with a high luck perk(at least, in my own experience) have received the rare masks more often than players with low luck perks
---
Radtoads
---
dont speculate. this crap is what leads to an echo chamber of wrong information.

XB1 here, happened 3x today.  My old XB1 crashed and even bought a new S model.  Made no real difference to game play, so it's obviously 100% server based.  I still love the game, but dang is it buggy.
---
(Unpopular opinion) here recently the lonely ness has had me more immersed as if the world is really gone. Makes me like the game a lot more tbh. 
---
i wasted whole battle once just rebuilding my generator and missile turrets xD I can handle wasting time
---
Make you look cool, duh. 
---
I’m so good at wasting time not even gonna get the queen to come in myself I’m gonna just wait for someone else to do it
---
How are we sure they aren't alts trying to get free stuff though? Mild /s
---
Why are you buying screws?  Farm them at the Capital building like everyone else. 
---
Radscorpions

YES! YES!! YEEEES!!! Same as Skyrim ones... just wooden dolls so we can put some armor pieces and weapons, it would add some nice feeling to your home when u hang your trusty riffle on your wall.. BETHESDA PLEASE!

Definitely the centaur. Those nasty fucks 
---
The reload on the single action feels 3 times slower than the reload on a Gatling gun with the drum magazine. The only other gun wit as obnoxious of a reload is the harpoon gun, which I can’t stant without the quick hands perk.
---
I didn't know I needed this until everyghoul in whitesprings bombarded me in a sleeping bag~
---
No, I meant that my comment was crapping on them a bit.  This game just feels a lot of the time like little thought went into how things work in real game play scenarios.
---
I know that feeling from fallout 3
---
I'd pay $60 again hell yeah. 
---
Odds are in your favour when they all live.
---
On number 2, don't you mean the resort exit? Or is this a different one? I always come in through the resort entrance and in that little office next to the dcon arch there's one hidden under the computer.
---
thats wrong....u fight with queen only in 1 purpose... EXP! u hit her once, then u leave her and u look for spawned scorched mobs... and guys with miniguns will do the rest. Sadly we dont have ultracite hammers so pffff
---
Seriously? You honestly saying that you can't take 2 seconds of your real life to back up and disengage from the vendor before going afk?
---
Ah yes i remember those fucks all over downtown dc scared the shit outta me
---
One person can. I tag the sloth, and then vats one shot every sting wing and wolf. Haven't lost a robot to the third spawn yet.
---
Let the lvl 50's and under swarm the sloth.
---
Yes I have, I don’t normally disconnect a lot but today I did
---
Don’t ask me but that’s what happens, can you confirm you can apply the BOS to an arm piece? 
---
There are a lot of tar berries in the cranberry bog, stretching from fissure site prime to the river near rob co. They are found in the trenches in the cranberry bog with water in them.
---
I’ve had disconnects and worse yet major lag a couple of times farming ghouls at WS.  I melee them and there’s like a 2 second delay in some cases.  
---
If anyone has a level 50 perfect storm, I'd like to buy it off you. I wish I would've known about the level scaling and I would've waited to finish this quest. A little PSA for others.
---
Yes
---
True I mean I’m level 38 so couldn’t actually help kill her anyway
---
I’ve noticed more the past few days
---
Oh boy. I play the game to have fun. I have thousands of hours in Fallout 3D games and I have never ever used VATS. Its obviously cheating.
---
 I come from Q3, Stalker and Doom. I'm old now and my chops will never be what they were but certainly good enough for this RPG.
---
 I am not in any challenge but you obviously are seriously involved. I dunno 'bout your Lever Action but mine hits at 128 and the 250 from the Instigate kills most stuff. Certainly Glowing Ghouls but that's not how I roll. 
---
 My knives are insane. They are immense fun as I play FP all the time and my stabby stabby sneaky guy takes down Harper's Ferry for fun. It is just the best the game has to offer really. 
---
 My no star Serrated Combat Knife hits at 150 repiared to 200%. That's maybe 3 times a sec and that is sustainable till my fucking mouse breaks. The DPS gets out of hand. At night I pull out a Nocturnal 40% Speed one and get 185 and maybe 5 a sec. Its immense fun to pull the Ghouls at Whitespring onto me and murder them so fast I take almost no damage to my X0-1.
---
 I play the game to have fun and boy I sure do.
---
 Not superior but I have been doing this for so long I don't have to think at all. Hell I shoot bugs out of the air with my Western Revolver for fun. It is in the front for 20% Speed.
---
 Keep on pounding that VATS button and have fun. I sure am. ;0

We can't expect that from a small individual company like Bethesda.

Whenever a player loads into an area the enemies scale to that players level. Someone much higher than you was recently there. Hop servers and try again.

I tried that. I sold two of those today to vendors after a WS nuke. Both were one star though. Isn't the splash damage way bigger than my tse combat shotty? I still kill myself using it...
---
&gt; I've waited over 3 minutes

Maybe they were using the vendor?

I take between 30 seconds and a few minutes depending on what I am selling/buying.

The clan-based auction houses work pretty great now - there's finally actually text search, but I barely care anymore. 
---
Although to be fair, if I see someone waiting and I know im going to be a few minutes I normally step back and let them do their quick sell.
---
But the main point in OP remains, only one person can use it at a time!
---
How about compromising by letting you transfer over a character and no weapons / armor? 
---
You can spend a while trying to spec yourself in a certain direction. 
---
It would be a shame if you had to do that over again. Especially if you have multiple leveled characters with different specs already. 
---
Well, dupers killed the market for months, where legit players were trying to sell. It is only now that it is turning back to normal.
---
I have the PS4 headset plug into my controller. I've talked to other players that I don't know often enough oh, but it sometimes gets difficult when they have their mics turned off and can't figure out how to turn them on. I can't imagine why anyone would prefer text chat to voice chat. Unless it's people trying to hide the fact that they're a guy playing a female character or vice versa.
---
true, I certainly hope bethesda ends up finding a way so that multiple people can use the same vendor at one time.
---
Yeah
---
I agree. 
---
I’ve tended to find tons of squirrels inside the house that the radtoads go through when those spawn later
---
This worked perfectly, thank you so much!
---
Except you can switch between PvP and PvE in wow freely now. And it’s not between servers. It’s between instances. You can choose to be instanced only with other pvp’ers or pve’ers. That makes sense and falls more in line what this is. But I’m sure you know a lot.

yes cause the people born in the vault know what a cigarette is

If you have the bloody mess perk hit the sloth with melee til it pops.
---
If only a portion if the vocal units that slammed F76 in its release have done what they said they were going to do, then there should be quite a lot of second hand games sitting at your local game store. Maybe wait for Easter sales and see what eventuates.
---
There are a few different mods out there that count as a legendary mod.  One is the sacrificial blade for the machete.  Another is the 50% more damage vs scorched, -20% vs all others.  
---
I haven't been able to really play since the patch.  Crashes to desktop, FPS loss, and just general weirdness.
---
This is all new since patch for me.
---
I would like to think it's the base map with new side missions and higher level +100 mobs (and hopefully higher level loot) and a more unforgiving environment closer to what I think of when I think of survival games. Because the base game isn't really all that challenging past say level 100 and I think if you want to keep your higher end players who've likely grown bored engaged you're gonna need a new map with bigger badder bad guys and a higher risk of death.
---
I have had the majority of y disconnects at the start of the Fasnacht event. I think it is when the majority of the players fast travel at once to the event location which causes a sort of server crash I am guessing. The sloth portion I have not experienced.
---
That is lame carebear crying. Workshops are there as a motivation to pvp. You agree to pvp, get out foxed at pvp and then cry about the pvp mechanic. 
---
Weapons for silo preparation don’t really matter so as your aim is true. Ammo a must for guns. Melee is another can of worms. 
---
If you want a fun nuke you can enjoy go for the fissure prime site. More fun seeing people band together killing her Highness queenie. 
---
I’ve noticed people really don’t like if you jump on their silo run. 
---
But the nuke zone is fair game. Unless you got some scum blocking the doors or something. 
---
If nothing else hit up YouTube for good nuke prep videos. 
---
1. Pc or PS4? 
---
2. Gatling with ultracite will be more than enough,  and Excavator is basically armor for everyone, but again u should have free BoS power armor at this point.
---
If u are on PS4  i can take you thru with my team, no problem so u can learn the basics
---
His outfit is actually in the atomic shop (If it wasn't gotten rid of during spring cleaning).
---
 I don't take explosive damage. ;)

 BoS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs.
---
Ah right cool cool
---
Is the camo skin still available? Can’t find it in the atom shop....
---
Thanks, and I don't think I've ever seen one irl. I had to do it because of how the ground was at that location plus it was different 
---
Set up your camp somewhere in the middle of the map to save caps for fast traveling long distance. I put my camp right out side top of the world and it worked great. I always had above 2000 without selling stuff
---
Vats will always deal more damage than non-vats. It has perks that make sure of that. It doesn't matter how you feel about it. It's basic math. A vats crit will deal double damage. Add to that instigating. Add to that eagle eyes. Add to that concentrated fire and all those other vats perks. In the end the damage of a manually shot lever action rifle will be dwarfed by what vats can do.
---
You can either accept it or write another paragraph stroking your own ego. 
---
OP asked if vats rifles are better than manual rifles and the answer to that is yes. Not because i said so, but because that's how math works. I'm not trying to change **your** mind so i'm done here.
---
Thanks! I will look into that. 
---
I wonder where the hubs of player vending machines will be?  Definitely nearby vault 76 I'm guessing as its a free FT
---
Exactly
---
The sloth one seem to happen when people hit it before it can be targetable with explosive damage and whatnot. 
---

It goes better in a team of at least 3 people. You may want to join up with experienced nukers. You fight your way all through the silo bunker so use your best weapon(s). Takes between 15 minutes to a half hour to launch. Longer if fewer people or lots of low level people.
---
Same thing happened to me. But because Fallout 76 takes so long to render stuff when you log in I couldn't see the fact I was standing in nuke cloud, and by the time the game synced up, I was already down 80% health. Zero time to react. =/
---
Idk
---
It’s close. Just missing the little mic/speaker thing on it. And the real hat. 
---
would be nice.
---
It’s like we are leaving loot for the future fallout heroes. 
---
Gta online you could smoke a cig and see them doing it
---
Its not bad, usually i drop everything (legendaries, weapons, armor parts, a lot of ammo) near the v76 so newbies can always grab it.  We are good community... usually 
---
Someone sold me the Assultron Blade Plans for 50 caps. Someone else tried to sell me Greek Letters plans for 500 caps.
---
Have you considered sharing your collected data after you've posted your conclusions? I'd still like to see your actual collection methods, as opposed to the conclusions you drew and estimates.
---
You must've missed the part where I literally said PVP is fine.
---
The problem is forcing someone into pvp from across the map.
---
Could you imagine if on any other game, a player could walk up to you and be 100% unkillable. Position himself perfectly with his overpowered melee weapon or whatever, then wait for you to turn around and THEN activate pvp and one shot you?
---
That shit wouldn't fly. 
---
Other than Centaurs, I'd have to say any kind of bugs. Ticks are pretty spooky, and if Honeybeasts were based on wasps more than bees I'd be 100x more terrified of them.
---
But they're not as bad as they could be. Every day I walk into a cave in Fallout I'm glad there's no such thing as a rad-spider.
---
I have a couple grognak’s as I collect them. I know I have Furious. Sold Bloodied. I have Anti Armor, Ghoul Slaying and Troubleshooter’s, but those aren’t for sake unless you’re willing to pay a very high premium. When I get online I’ll post more specifics of ones I have for sale. 
---
Maybe it's Natural, Maybe it's Radiation. 
---
I like to follow lone wolfs. I have had players get super pissed. I had a guy accidentally kill himself by trying to lure me into agro and sprint away. He logged after dying. I just like seeing what you are up to. The dramatic reactions from lone wolf players make it a 10/10 experience. 
---
If there is too many low level, this few nice Dominators that spawn in the mid of silo, will have a easy work on anyone who is unprepared :P
---
Pretty much I don't remember the max capacity of each but just say you only have 1 it will only produce 7 or 8 in an hour and won't produce anymore

It's a workshop that gives very little content. Just let it go.

i think the reason for nothing there is because there is nothing left, after everything burned upon crashing
---
Hacker and lockpick to the max will help. Plenty of stimulants and health won't go awry either. An ability to keep calm when overwhelmed by asualtrons, general gutsties, and robobrains will help. Oh, and that week's codes and nuclear keycard.
---
Weapons and armor that suits your game style. And being able to fast travel to your camp, dump excess and get to the nuke zone as it starts means you will max your experience. The first time is always a rush 🤘🤘
---
Lol this the more funny thing I read 
---
They already fixed all that, hence why I said before the xp and tse nerf. What does duping have to do with any of that?

I completely and respectfully disagree. Though juucehead USED to be a wonderful go-to for FO76 info, his videos have gotten extremely preachy, one sided, and overly subjective. His obvious displeasure with Bethesda and the Game has affected his videos so much that now I consider him to be the FO76 equivalent of tabloid fodder. I would not recommend his videos to anyone seeking an impartial or general knowledge view of the game.

First off, I'm liberal and would actually really like if they made the damn cigarettes do something besides be vendor fodder... I mean I cant even put them in strategic places any more because everything dropped just goes in a bag. 
---
People can Nuke whenever they want. It’s a survival game, it’s not supposed to be all peachy for you 24/7 (just saying)
---
Anyone got the Jester mask? it look really cool but it never dropped ffs
---
Karen was a mean motherfucker 
---
You can also run around with a lit cigar in your mouth with a cosmetic item.
---
Holy shit i just saw one and screamed
---
Me too, but was refreshing to find out it wasn’t about the masks.
---
If you’re brave enough to battle through a nuclear site there is a ton of desk fans and typewriters down there. 
---
The beret is rare? I have about 4. This says a lot of how much time I've spent grinding out the event. 
---
 I long ago decided that for me, VATS is cheating, so I don't do it. I'm happy to accept the handicaps that come from that, as I dominate the fucking game anyway. 
---
 I understand the general lack of shooter skill in the population of an RPG and accept that VATS is good for those who just like RPGs and have poor shooter skills. My original post was just a short course in sniping moving targets as I thought that might be useful.
---
 I hold myself to higher standards. ;)
---
How can I join? I've seen this kind of group thing before, but no one can tell me how to join. 
---
On top of Watoga emergency center and on top of the  the building directly across from it is a pretty reliable spawn point for T51b man.  Pretty easy to find in just few server hops most of the time.  There's some RNG involved, but it's RNG lite. 
---
I mean probably. I have my bar / Vendor set up right on the corner by the overseer Camp. Between the camp in the bridge.
---
It's not that far for people to fast travel to me.
---
&gt;  Kiddos to other players 
---
I think you mean kudos. giving people kiddos as a reward might be a bit on the illegal side.....
---
To add on to that; grape mentats and sweet rolls stack with hard bargain to get better buying and selling prices
---
I Ment kuddos lmao
---
It’s the event. To many people in the same area. I never understood why Bethesda pushed events that cause the FPS to drop, crazy lag, and disconnects when the server can’t take it. Same
---
With SBQ’s. I’ve done the event 8 times, and been dc’d 4 right at the end. 
---
Not trying to be an ass here,  but remember it’s just some masks.  I get that it’s pretty lame to do an event involving such a simple thing and give it lottery odds—. But at the end of the day it’s just a silly mask,  not a 3 shot exploding anti armor bloodied 5 star handmade.  
---
It would be cool if they had the cigarettes and that’s the fact. I don’t care that your liberal it doesn’t matter, you know what i meant. You’re good if I’m good. 
---
Not super rare but not one of the crap masks, after 120 runs I have 6 berets, if they were rare masks that would be fair... 6 rare masks in 120 runs would be worth the grind I think. 
---
Kudos 
---
Okay now the real question, can you build up there? Curious if the no build zone extends up there.
---
Sounds unlikely. There's a chance you won't even get a mask if any of the bots die so surely you're better off making sure they survive.
---
Don’t let her read his letters to his dad in the Flatwoods funeral parlor then.  Those are almost worse 
---
After doing the Fastnacht festival two level 100-200s followed me back to my camp and proceeded to use LMGs to destroy my walls and camp. Other than that if you want people to go to your camp you could try placing it near the entrance of a town. Not all the time but you will get some travelers.
---
Or maybe something everyone can get to that has a free travel cost....
---
VATS should not be part of PvP. 
---
50 runs of the event for me and I'm still missing 3 plans. I've yet to see a single player with a rare mask.
---
Yeah but that shit is not in English, I found your post more informative!
---
And if he had shot you from 1000m away that would have been better?
---
Melee will always do more damage,  because you have to get next to the person (or scorch beast, or mirelurk queen) to apply your damage.  Which has the added danger of being within range of their op melee damage.
---
I get it,  you went into a pvp activity (taking a workshop) and then while you were collecting your power cores, somebody one shot you. That sucks. So your solution is make it so melee does less damage.
---
Which means ranged has to also do less damage since there is soo much less danger when attacking from range.
---
Sooo mobs, which people have already been complaining are too hard to kill, become even harder to kill.
---
Hey Bethesda! I want to complain because someone killed me, thats not fair!  Fix it, so my playstyle is supreme! 
---
I maintain around 2000 caps, but lately I e gotten up to around 3500 average. I fast travel quite a bit but I also take advantage of my camp and the vault. and I dont really fast travel anywhere that costs like 25 or more to travel. I'll wait till I have multiple things I need to do in the area. before I make the trip.
---
You ever heard of a critical build? It's one of the best and only way to deal with sentinal armor, assassins armor, and cavaliers armor. It is part of PvP and with good reason since critical hits ignore OP armor.
---
what a fun addition to this game huh? seriously the worst $60 I ever spent. The only thing missing is microtransactions 
---
Hey! Thanks for the help. Resetting it fixed the bug, and I can communicate freely.

---
So much spoiled meat though....
---
Just go to Watoga and buy them?
---
Pretty useful.
---
Kinda looks like John Krasinski! 
---
I think watoga sells them for 1200 without any buffs. get the hard bargin perk up to 3 stars and you might be able to buy it. if not tack on some booze and grape mentats.
---
What's the good boy's name? 
---
Done yet? I'm game to help. 
---
I wish Bethesda would add the feature to display our power armor because the first thing I tried doing when I got the PAS was to display my power amor.
---
I got a disconnect right when the people on my server started to attack the scorched beast queen.  :(
---
Thanks for the offer and comments - but I am on XB1.
---
VATS is an integral part of Fallout. There are dozens of PvP shooters that don’t have it. FO76 doesn’t need to be another one. 
---
:/ me and some buddies all just got kicked and it just says waiting on the main menu.
---
They'll be part of an event with the same drop rate as the rare Fasnacht masks
---
I think damage should be calculated differently for PvP and PvE.
---
I have a 1* AA GA. Top level. What price would you put on that? I'll prob sell it after I play with it a bit. 
---
A special hell.
---
My ps4 has been running the game smoothly lately. It might just be your platform.
---
True that! I can't stop playing it tho. 
---
Hey bro. Im lvl 115 atm, my team is around 50-80 ...if u would like to add me, we can play something together. U are very welcome to join our worlds and team up with us. Helping with questlines, hunts and power leveling :)

Well to be fair. Pokemon events generate rare shinies more often. Ive gotten 5 during a comm day. If the same principal applied here......

You're entitled to your opinion, but maybe you should look to yourself. His videos seem to me, to be the only ones that aren't either vicious toward Beth or ready to marry them.
---
First you need all the required perk cards 
---
They should defiantly add more cosmetics for the the weapons in the game. 
---
 If I went serious PvP I would need to use VATS. That is the main reason I will not do that as I will not use that ancient cheat. 
---
 I have thousands of hours in Fallout 3D games and never ever used VATS.
---
Did you find the My Angel?  
---
&gt;!There's a tower where they have a massive pile of dirt at the base of the tower with toy blocks saying "My Angel" on them. You go to the top of the tower and there's a woman with a pistol, dead in a pile of toys. It's obvious what happened and you don't need a note. !&lt;  
---
This game is stupid rich in nonverbal lore but people are to dumb and impatient to find it without a note somewhere nearby.
---
Sense the last patch the servers have been a little buggy but they are still way better then they were before patch 6. 
---
I would love to see a gas mask that acts like the Metro games. You get like 5 min surface time and then start taking damage until you change your filter. All of my characters carry a gas mask, but diseases in this game aren't a big deal really. Most of them go away in like 15 minutes and the only real damaging one is  bone worms 
---
Hitting it Bloody Mess perk will cause it to explode. You can loot it then.
---
Especially when those fuckers attack. I try to avoid them as much as possible.
---
 As I said above I have thousands of hours in Fallout 3D games without ever using it. 
---
The ground one shots me with its blunt damage every time I approach it with great speed. I should at least be able to cause it to be staggered. 
---
Ooh I'll have to remember this little trick, Thanks!
---
The thing stands motionless and unlootable for me like 2/10 times I did this event
---
Just gimme the Plagued set please :3 i can pay

---
I don't even smoke and I agree with this post. 👍😀
---
I built it 
---
I've actually joined the same server 3 times in a row so sometimes RNG gets you.
---
I would like to bring up the ideas of having Bashas, Bergens and Assult Vests into the discussion...
---
This is awesome, I've built my Vendor Shop an ready, looking forward to meeting up with others and trading wares soon.
---
I like the idea of carrying wounded people around, but I would be a little cautious in that regard. For instance; How long before someone decides to down a player, then throw them in a cell made out of concrete foundations? Yeah I guess they could fast travel, but not if their captor keeps them in constant combat. 
---
Elder Maxsim’s BOS. 
---
I like instigating over bloodied. 
---
Probably doesnt add as much damage but allows you to play at full health with consistently high damage and not rely on unyeilding and bolstering legendaries so probably alot cheaper to put together too. Bloodied is defintly still better but if your on a budget junkie would be alot easier to get together.
---
How so?
---
I play once a day for a few minutes to hours.  In the past week or so since the Fasnacht thing has been going I end about 50% of my sessions with a disconnect.
---
On PS4 I've had a small number of assholes, and a few ppl who were indifferent to it all, but I've met an overwhelmingly large number of great players who are just looking to have fun.
---
I wanted this for a while.
---
Thanks everyone - super helpful.  I’m actually embarrassed to admit I didn’t realize there was a whole battle within the silo before launching as well 👍.
---
I think I have them on another character. Selling for 850 caps let me check. 
---
I am mostly ignored, which is how I prefer it. A handful of good people who want to help, and that one guy I mentioned previously. Seems like we have a good community
---
You want to steal my camp location? xD  West from V76 near the crashed vertibird there is a small lake with rocks around it... perfect camp spot
---
No. Please don't bring that Fortnite garbage into this game. 
---
Turns out it was just the crappy bored players. Rather than the "liarsand cheaters"
---
Though its been lately. I just wish they would stop going for my rad shower. Getting fluxes to repair sucks
---
You dont want to be Tony Stark?
---
Great point!  
---
Uncommon and rare because if memory serves half of the masks that are not dropping are uncommon...  
---
So give us the expect uncommon and expected rare... 
---
That said, it seems that CHA and not Luck effects the quality of drops like this
---
But yes, I was referring to the tv show that's why I said David.

Yeah, for a sniper build most of the time your enemies are full health. So if you have instigating, then you’ll just do double the damage which is initially better than bloodied. However, you have mostly unyielding armor. I would keep the bloodied rifle until I get a full set of some other legendary armor if I were you. 
---
 Bethesda has the masks shown as a reward for the event. Right on the menu screen. So I get why people can be frustrated when it's presented in a way that makes it feel like you can get a shot at cool rewards. It's very underwhelming. Especially with this being the first limited time event. Personally I'm not mad. I actually love the owl mask (and 10 duplicates) and will probably wear it regularly. I even found a spot for the effigy in my camp. So it's definitely not all negative at least. 
---
Very true, I love the community in F76 I feel like the only good thing about all the bad juju on F76 launch is, it seems like most of the buttheads in these types of games went to Red dead 2.
---
Yes I have them if you still need them. 850 caps. They are around 1500 from a vendor. 
---
When u finish BoS Storyline u are getting plans for free, so when he finish the storyline he will also get one for himself
---
I always keep a hazmat suit in my inventory.
---
Not specific to this post, but in general, I just wish people would stop wording “I’d like it if” as “we need”.
---
what system u on?
---
He’s already part of the BOS. He’s just unlucky enough of not getting any of the paints.
---
But to get ALL the rare masks you'd have to do a lot  more than that... but one would be better than none. 
---
I don't think theres a need to at the moment. A majority of players complain about never having enough when things can cost 3k and there's always something that you could buy unless you're at the point where you have everything. If you are at that point like myself always being at around 22k, we are kinda part of the "Suffering from Success" group. It's kinda like having a problem with your gas tank being full especially since a majority of my caps go to fast traveling everywhere so my friends can piggy back.
---
Player vending that everyone here keeps mentioning would require a upgrade, but I hope its never more than the 50 or 100k you suggested just so we dont have this cap hoarders haha. 
---
Well when he finish bos storyline he will get plans of ultracite armor and one already created for future use... xD i just gave away my parts of full ultracite to some lvl 25 yesterday xD I must stop creating armors and giving them away...srsly its eating my parts

Finding Colonel's notes in Flatwoods hit pretty hard, especially the written ones inside the funeral home.
---
I know it isn't a very likely reality knowing how things went down in Appalachia, and he's definitely dead by now considering the way literally everybody else is, but I hope Colonel at least got a quick, easy death and didn't get turned into one of the Scorched or a Ghoul or something.
---
 They appear on Strangler Pods once in a while. The Mire and Dyer Chemical are useful clues. ;)
---
Oddly enough this morning 2~5am est I noticed I was the only person on the server and I was checking the map pretty consistently every twenty mins or so and I didn't have a single Fasnacht event start up in that whole window, Then I server hopped to a more populated server and bam there it was.
---
Makes me wonder if the time of day or amount of people on the server affect it🤔
---
Basic Ghouls. I adore Fallout's not-zombie Zombies for the creepiness

Doesn’t Rose send you there before you have to head to Huntersville? Trapper’s Camp?
---
Hell, I just want to park my arse on my couch, warm up a can of Pork n' Beans on the campfire, and be able to open the door to my nuka cola machine and pull out a cold one. I actually thought I was buying a functional vending machine. If at some point, when the powers that be allow us, we are able to display contents, I wouldn't mind stocking and refilling it myself. 
---
I made a huge misunderstanding. I’m talking about the paints. Sorry!
---
Displaying rare skins?
---
Did you not read my reply?
---
That would also be cool. Instead of a stash. I was referring to the door to the nukashine. 
---
They should add something like the conga taunt from TF2, where anyone can join the dance as long as one person initiates it. It would be a fun, silly way to kill time in large groups
---
Ok thanls I'll try that now
---
To be fair, there is something to be said for how you can be incredibly spongey in PvE, but PvP almost abides by "realistic" damage rules.  Somehow, in Survival Mode, they'll have to square that circle and find a proper balance.
---
xD no problem. In that case i cant help...only paint i use right now is the camo paint from atom shop xD GL Pal! xD

Oh, I knew that. Just a little time to vent between Vintage Nukashine blackouts. 😉

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
That doesn't sound like an accurate description of adding a different game mode at all though.
---
I saw a guy on PS4 with the Jester mask about an hour ago, if you’d like to add the image to your list: https://imgur.com/a/iEbIF9X
---
I like to save the ammo and plans I don't need and drop them while doing my cap run the next day. Someone might as well get it.
---
Ya, I think they were saying they were adding bobblehead stands and magazine racks, so they may do that also. 
---
There could be a possibility that this is coming soon. I think in one of the inside the vault articles they spoke about allowing us to decorate our camps with static items. Clothing on a mannequin would be considered static I believe. We'll see though. Awesome request for sure. 
---
Good one... start writing books please
---

On ps4,  I can only talk to/ hear my team if we're in auto. People not in team, I have to switch to area
---
Yeah. lol
---
Mirelurks, those mutant hermit crabs with vans as shells, fog crawlers, etc.
---
Not defending anyone but, I'm really slow at vendors and I do all my buying and selling at one time so I've been in venders upwards of 5+ minutes before.
---
Though to be fair I will back out if I think I'm going to be awhile and see others waiting.
---
Well if u hit him with a hammer he break.... i know that already xD
---
Since the last patch the servers have been horrendous 
---
I've heard that he can give you a note that contains an "insult". Haven't had it occur to me before though. He came to one of the Fasnacht parades today which was pretty funny considering it's protectrons all marching in the parade. Guess he thought he was missing out!  
---
At first I was like "Oh, well because they don't want to promote smoking" 
---
But then you finished it off with a well honed point about popping pills and I was like "damn... OP has a point... " 
---
Omg man. Battle toads Double Dragon was one of my favorite games as a kid!
---
FWIW, its my understanding that open and repeated visual displays of cigarette smoking in movies can turn a PG-13 movie into an R rating. 
---
its unfair and kind of ironic ( i believe alcohol kills more people than cigs on a yearly basis) that john wick/jack bauer can delete dozens of people from the earth in a short amount of time but cant have a smoke after.
---
kids dont smoke anyways, they vape.   id imagine it has to do with markets where the game is sold.
---
The more people you take into the silo, the more robots spawn, so some people prefer to do the silo run solo. Max lockpick and hacker are great in there (especially hacker for turning off turrets).
---
The first time you run it, it may take you an hour if you get turned around. 
---
Make sure you have 15 circuitry and maybe that much plastic to build the motherboards you need so you don't have to hunt them all down. 
---
I would go with a personal guide at least once, but that's me.

I was so pumped to find out you could tame things, until I saw it took up like 30% of your budget for a house cat...

*shrug*  
---
In the past when sharing raw data the usual response has been "why didn't you video it" because it seems people want to see hundreds of hours of video to prove X happened.  
---
(At one point I had a spreadsheet with a few thousand legendary items when I noticed patterns in the Drops, and it was frequently dismissed because I didn't record 6 hour+ repeated WhiteSprings runs)
---
  
---
What kind of collected data are you thinking people would be interested in / wanted to see?  
---
In this case the data collected was pretty basic:  
---
-Start event and get estimate on player count.
---
-Log event number.  
---
-Log any usual issues during the event.
---
-Record any events with less than perfect results (dead robots).  
---
-Poll the players participating(usually once you say "I got a X mask" everyone else then chimes in, and then people start trading / giving away plans. (Which also results in people complaining if they didn't get a mask)
---
-Check for any issues (missing plans, masks, etc.).
---
-Repeat quest.   
---
Collect similar data sets from the other nuts who've given me past bug reports, I've grinded WhiteSprings with, etc. ("we completed it 20 times with 15 people yesterday" etc.)
---
I stopped recording what masks I got After the 5th time it became clear the common ones dropped with more or less identical frequency, and the few less frequent rewards stood out clearly after the 10th time (x4 rewards for each event, so 40 data sets)
---
I did the same thing. Was waiting for an insult got impatient, instigating super sledge to the dome. 😂 
---
Yeah I learned that the hard way when I fired at a group of super mutants fighting a mega sloth.
---
We all died that day😐
---
This has occurred a lot since the parade has been running. I guess the servers can't handle the strain of most people in one location. 
---
Exactly and it's not made for one person, it's made for the community as a whole. I have learned that others enjoy ideas as long as it hits things that make it more interesting and allows the community to enjoy together. That's why I enjoy this game alot because we can mold the game the way we want it to be.
---
Oh that’s cool, I didn’t know that!
---
Any advice as to what kind of set?
---
I've had as high as 55, but usually 35-50. Still drops varied level items regardless.
---
Maybe look for an instigating one? 
---
I had him spawn up by the Brotherhood camp that you drop the tech documents off at. No matter how many times I activated him, no insult. Although the first time I activated him, he said 'Scanning for intelligent lifeforms. None found' so, maybe I did get burned then....  
---
VATS Rifleman.
---
When my perk cards activate i deal 200something damage per shot. Using an instigating rifle doubles that. VATS crits will also double the damage. Same with sneak shots (tho i rarely sneak). 
---
A build like this does have lower initial damage/shot but the effective damage gets pretty damn high and i don't have to sacrifice anything.
---
As for survivability i'm using X-01 PA with all AP mods. Never died in PVE. X-01 is also pretty easy to get, AP mods are quite common so it shouldn't be that hard to give it a try. Since you're a ranged build you'll rarely have to fix the PA so it's quite efficient in terms of junk required to maintain.
---
There are no plans for x-01 beyond the pieces.  Everything else is a mod and you can buy them at the Enclave bunker at Whitesprings.  But the vendor only has a few at a time so it’s a huge pain in the ass.
---
u/bluehazemay runs a shop with a lot of the mods.
---
“Being a *Cat Person*” -You, 2019
---
A simple and straight to the point tldr. Nice.
---
It's the fact that people are grinding for them and aren't getting a single one
---
Doesn't google automatically ask to translate it for you? The basic gist of that other post is the person used a glitch (don't think it specified which one) and listed some similarities to the footage we saw of the vendor, pretty much guaranteeing that this will eventually be it
---
😁
---
You on ps4? I have all of the plans
---
It ain’t worth it. My friend and I did this and nothing interesting spawns.
---
I read that with the "*maybe it's maybelline****"*** tune in my head xD
---
Right but my point is critical are a counter to some otherwise invinsible builds and it's not just about skill here.
---
I have experienced this as well. There is a chance they changed it so vats never works on crouched players. You used to be able to shoot them first and gain 5 seconds of vats time, but it seems like it is gone. Maybe I was just unlucky with the bug you got, idk.
---
If you’re looking to be at high health, then I would recommend Vanguard’s. This grants up to 35 damage and energy resistance, the higher your health. You can also look at this legendary guide: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Instigating is sure good againsted BLOODIED :)
---
Yeah that was supposed to be fixed and is the reason why we keep scrapping bulk on accident now. :/ Are you sure they scrapped? I'd bought some mods at the bunker earlier, went to store all junk and somehow my mods got deposited into stash too. They might be in your stash.
---
I've tamed some, but they became hostile again after like 20 seconds
---
I've thought about walking around in the survival servers with a low lvl character in ared nurse uniform and a sign. Just to see what the encounters would be like.
---
Do these creatures move with you on other servers after you tame them, if they are still alive when you disconnect?
---
Be sure to check the blue suitcases as well. Paper bags despawn in 30-45 minutes, but stuff in an actual container stays longer, so some of us leave things there instead. Every station has a blue suitcase. 
---
Give me your username
---
I've read that you can't. Just paint your friends armor and put him out of his misery. 😂
---
I want Nuka Cola paint for my regular armour. 
---
Or something a little more obviously Nuka-themed apparel-wise. 
---
Honestly, I’d throw money at anything with Nuka Cola on it. Even better if it’s attainable in-game. 
---
That door, though. Beautiful. 
---
I had a guy with a triple meat hook and what I'm assuming is the 'bloodied' build because he had very little health, start slapping me and would have killed me in less than a minute of sustained slap damage if I hadn't healed.
---
What platform? If xbox I think I've got at least one already made, possibly a mod there too.
---
Sheepsquatch, huh?
---
Odd how so many of these are shared between both the animal friend and wasteland whisperer perk. The quantum deathclaws sound fun, so do the ghoul super mutants. FEV hounds might be those big boys that super mutants have with them in F4, or are those referred to as something else in the game files?
---
Saw you're on xbox. I'll lead you through the silo if you want. Pm me your GT and I'll join you. 
---
I got you! I did a similar thing on the open side of the bridge and built a stairwell down into the main space under the bridge! 
---
Anyways I’m on now! Shoot me a message at my gamertag 
---
The door didn’t load for me so I waltzed right in. There was absolutely nothing, and by that I mean it was clear with no texture. It was before the latest dlc, so it could be different. 
---
It will be boring. Try it with a high level character and a good build, maybe throw in a little whiskey. Then kill people. Or just follow them around and stand there. Or don't do any of that because fuck it. 
---
Should be able to grow pot as well and use it for healing effects 
---
Max i saw was 426 lvl i think.
---
I got the game 2 weeks after release and saw already lvl 20X at that time while at the same time people on reddit made rant for been about lvl 70.
---
I do paint it. He just wants the actual plans. You see he’s a collected. He tries to get rare outfits like all the masks at the heltavia event (but invisibly he siding get the rare ones lol) 
---
Yeah I don't want to be flagged but luckily we don't use rifles unless we are at the range. Too many people get flagged by privates coming right out of AIT.
---
Well fuk u tew
---
Hopefully they add that
---
There an awesome mod for FO4 called Usable Cigarettes.  You can smoke any cigarettes you find along with the 60 second animation.  It also saves the game which is great in survival.  I love knowing I’m about to face some bad stuff and hanging out having a smoke before I go in.   
---
XD
---
1. Yes.  Otherwise you'll probably find yourself a bit overwhelmed in a Scorchbeast Queen fight, and it's also good to experiment with what does and doesn't work.  
---
2. For the silo, you're going to be dealing exclusively with robots and turrets.  Among these may be Colonel Gutsy, who uses anti-armor rounds.  Multiple Gutsys can really do the number on your HP, so consider investing in perks like Born Survivor (Agility, automatically applies Stimpacks at different HP levels) and Field Surgeon (Charisma, increases the speed that Stimpacks refill health).  Troubleshooter's gear (bonus damage to robots) can help.  There is a portion of the silo which is irradiated, so you'll likely want Power Armor for there, if not the whole thing.  
---
For the Scorchbeast Queen, the Cryolator with the Crystallizing Barrel and about 200-300 rounds of Cryo Cells can make a huge difference in whether or not you successfully defeat the Queen because it keeps her locked to the ground and slows her attacks.  Most of the damage will be done on the ground, not in the air, so it is important to keep her grounded for as long as possible.  Unfortunately, you pretty much have to craft the Cryo Cells yourself, because I'm not aware of a reliable location to get them.  
---
3. If you know what you're doing, you can do a silo in 20-30 minutes.  Your times can be improved if you repair some of the Damaged Mainframe Cores from a previous run prior to starting a new one (although you won't have those the first time).  Your first time, I'd expect it to take maybe 45 minutes.  
---
4. Yeah, don't divert the Queen over to you and run away with her.  Try to avoid getting in other player's line of fire, as some have Furious weapons that rely on them hitting the same target.  Don't call for help unless you're dying, since that pulls players away from other things.  Finally, don't arrive the moment the Queen spawns - her durability is buffed by the number of players present at the start.  If ten players are standing around, you're going to have an extremely difficult fight versus if there's just one.  
---
To that end, one of the big decisions is whether or not to leave Drop Site C2 out of the Blast Zone.  In the past, players used to do this because you could draw the Queen out of the Nuke Zone and allow players to use things like Unarmed attacks against her, since they wouldn't need Power Armor.  But on the flip side, this can also result in low-level players showing up who contribute *nothing* to the battle except buffing the Queen.  And Bethesda has made the Queen kick out a lot more Rads these days, so most players will want Power Armor anyway if they are going to melee her.  
---
Also, bring more than one Nuclear Keycard to a silo, just in case you screw up the nuke code.  Note that the code is accepted or declined the moment you enter the last digit, so make sure everything up to that point is correct before you do it.
---
It took two characters to get me a pair of calibrated shocks.  I found them for one leg on my main, and another for the other leg on my alt.   I transferred the second one to my main to fit both legs.
---
I really hate gulpers, it's like getting screwed up by a giant slimy Yao guai
---
+karma thank you maxpowers!
---
You want a picture 
---
Wow another person mentioned the game too. This sounds pretty awesome.
---
Sorry had to word this better. Gotten flames on public Facebook and whatnot. 
---
So I respect bloodied. It’s great damage. 
---
It’s cool in a way to see it paired with a armour effect to make better. 
---
But me personally I can do more with instigating legendary weapons. Being a stealth marksman a sneak crit and instigating effect just feels way better and I don’t have to be low health to ensure I can use it. 
---
Yeah there’s more damage in a bloodied build but one wrong move and your damage is gone or you have to get low to get back to your sweet spot. Instigating is always there providing you see the target first and fire first. 
---
Like it said bloodied it great but it’s worn out for me. I’ve used it and I hate the restriction placed on you. 
---
Maybe I’m wrong. Play the way you feel but I find instigating just does it better. 
---
Did you read mine? I won't use VATS, and PvP is not my focus because of that.
---
 I have played a great deal of deathmatch in my time, and I would love to have Fallout 76 with no VATS, no Legendaries and no Fast Travel. I could get my teeth into that.
---
Just let all the robot died 100%chance of rare masks :p
---
Cool, hopping on in a moment! 
---
On the grounds of inside the building?
---
Woah never thought of that will def give it a try
---
Flamers can't melt bulk steel.
---
what's wrong with just expanding the current vendor system? Have players build a vendor or computer in their CAMP. have that link up to all the other players' computers and robo vendors (player owned and npc) currently on the server. Any time a player sells to a robo-vendor, the system updates and someone can purchase it. Then one of those cargo ships comes by and drops it at your camp if it came from another vendor, only retrievable by you (you could make some possibly fun/not fun mechanic where other players can shoot down the drone so then you have to retrieve it). With a vendor system, the prices are set, and then you are just relying on luck to find what you want. Sellers will get their caps instantly and buyers will have to be on their toes. This would just require the devs to re-evaluate the value of some items and adjust them.
---
Players who want to go through trading and selling in person (to make extra caps) can do that, but I don't think it should be integrated to the game itself as an auction house. That just opens the door to some problems (Bots, over inflation, etc). 
---
ok follow up question. Are the headlamps an exception? Cause my character can craft ever light mod for the x-01. Red Tactical, Purple, Blue, Vault Boy etc. 
---
 For me its about the fun and I don't like VATS. ;)
---
I’ve only had one server crash in the past few weeks but I think even that was just it restarting since the faschnaut event started immediately. Xbox btw
---
That I do not know.
---
*everyone hated that*
---
I should say Centaurs. They are gross. They make me sad. Same with Abominations or Swamp People. But I have to go with Mothman. I have a... Tiny fear of moths, and everything about Mothman makes me ill. The sound effects, the design. Ugh--
---
I still have a selfie with Wise Mothman, tho
---
He's chill
---
I already do all the cool things that writers do. Drugs, alcoholism, bang younger chicks, family alienation, and self-loathing. The only other things writers do is make money, eventually get poor again, and kill themselves, and I've done all three of those things at least a dozen times this week.
---
Thanks, but kthenx. 
---
Just server hop. Griefers are in every online game.
---
A silo seems like it becomes more difficult the more players you have, but at the same time, you'll complete the objectives a lot faster.
---
Sometimes I get lucky and the Laser Turrets simply aren't there.  I'm not sure what causes that - someone attempting the silo before me and disconnecting or leaving?
---
Just bringing some ideas to the table. You can like it or not but it's ultimately up to the community and Bethesda. 
---
I got all those 
---
Where do you farm these plans?
---
Tech data? 
---
Exactly, griefers exist in every online game. Just server hop instead of crying about it on Reddit for attention.
---
Heck. Either I guess, but mainly the 2f inside.
---
No you don’t.
---
Wow that was actually thinking outside the box. This is why I like it when I get others to come up with scenarios when things like this happen. You actually have me wanting to rethink that idea now.
---
It's never too late to quit. Think about what you're saying. You've been smoking 7 years longer than I've been alive, so assuming you started at 16, that makes you 56? 57? Maybe 50? 
---
So you have kids? Grandchildren? Parents that might still be around and need your help? You're old enough (if my guess of your age above is nearly correct) to know how long and short 6 months can be. You could buy AT LEAST that much time by just not smoking. 
---
You've been doing it for so long, you can't imagine life without it. I understand that. But, I also know for an absolute fact, you WILL feel better without it. 
---
Smoke the rest of what you have, with the knowledge that once those are gone, that's it. Every time you put a cigarette in your mouth, that's a day less you'll get. You're buying time. 
---
I believe in you. You already know it's a problem. You already admitted you feel like you have no control over it, and resigned yourself to your demise. Fuck that. Fight.
---
Take control, mate. Take control. You can do it. Just stop. 
---
I had him spawn as a 3*** legendary at my camp, killed him for a 1* armor.
---
Yep, Radtoads and some scorched set this off pretty well. *puke*
---
Definitely the fog crawlers! Looks like something from the upside down 
---
Was there a release date for this? 
---
 I love at this point fallout isn't even the convo lol
---
Oh then your probably trying to take animals that cant be tamed what are you trying to tame?
---
Yeah I know the feeling 
---
The train station?
---
I was under the impression that we’d get into the allageny? Room and governors room when the presidential PA and Gauss rifle come out. 
---
Mmm now that's a thought. I feel it could help out alot but what do you propose the use for them?
---
I watch a LOT of FO76 YT videos and can tell yuh with certainty that times have changed a bit. 
---
A year or two ago, it would have been Oxhorn, JV2017, VynlicPumaGaming, and juicehead. But these days I actually wouldn’t recommend any of those. 
---
I really like Rifle Gaming lately. Granted, he’s more end-game based but he does cover info for new players as well. Plus even his older content is still fresh and relevant. 
---
InnovSurvivist is a good replacement for juicehead. She presents an honest look at events and the Gabe and provides sound advice for new age seasoned players alike. 
---
CaptainNoob is extremely entertaining and though he isn’t really a presenter that is focused on new players, his weapon reviews are spot on and his play thru builds are great entertainment as well. 
---
Fur builds, I suggest Jug and the final render. Jug presents an educational build format that shows how to really make the building functions work toward your liking and using items in different ways. 
---
The Final Render is incredible at building and presents some amazing builds that are definitely worth viewing. 
---
And add a ultracite receiver ontop of that and you've got the deadliest scorch killer ever
---
The bot stop, where enclave event pops.
---
He can use a railroad spike 
---
&gt;I know how the taming works and how it must be a rand encounter and not in groups but im asking where i can get a good place for random events involvong animals I will be able to tame cuz im only level 36
---
If the variables are server side, or part of the undecoded data, maybe..  
---
But based on the ESM all that matters is the number of them alive at the end.
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking. Resources are not hard to find in this game. Like just server hop instead of crying about it on reddit. It does suck to get your base destroyed. However, if Bethesda wanted to make CAMPS immune to damage, they would’ve done so by design since the beginning.
---
Just because you don't PVP doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I don't do it either, but I understand the need to have a way to counter those builds. This is a multi-player game, after all. 
---
One: Where is it located and   
---
Two: WHat's teh second building look like beside it?  
---
Oh, and  
---
Three: GREAT JOB!
---
I just want to kill a wendigo in my stinking clown outfit. I didn’t sign up for a mirelurk fest!!! I completely agree. Got jumped by four kings at the rail yard west of Watoga.
---
Karma yep. 
---
Ohhhh I'm sorry I thought you were asking how to tame stuff lol sorry just go to the mire I have found tons of stuff there it has plenty of random encounters 
---
I have the prototype plans. Got them in the armory. How does one get the plans for the regular?
---
dude looks like a lady
---
You are not “forced” into pvp. You chose pvp by taking the workshop....
---
cool thanks
---
You monster...
---
Except you **are** forced into pvp?
---
How are you not grasping this concept?
---
 I have several ways to punish griefers. If VATS did not exist I would happily do PvP, but I will not use it. Its so fucking lame. ;)
---
"u/MrYac is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will... something you know very little about. I once saw him kill three men in a bar... with a railway spike, with a fucking railway spike. Who can do that!?"
---
Good Lord, what is that guy doing to that sign?!
---
I actually got foundations placed *on top* of the bridge. Only could get three, because of a stupid brick, but whatever.
---
Haha
---
figured i'd wait a day to see if the game is going to randomly drop him off a mountain before I get attached enough to name ;)
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds is North West of Vault 76, almost in the corner. Big ferris wheel on the map.
---
That specific rocket ride is on the north side of the fairgrounds.
---
As for the building next to it, some sort of concession stand I think?
---
i found one of those too, can't interact with him of course but here's hoping a future update will give us some more pet options. 
---
Nah ...tbh In Adventure mode Stash should have no max cap. When Survi shows up then 500-1k  to make players choose between life or death... But 
---
Did a run where only 1 bot was hit 1 time by a wolf at the end.. same rewards, but not flawless
---
I just did one. I followed him to the funeral home in flatwoods and he sung to the skeleton in the casket. 
---
there's a little digital pup just waiting in the wasteland for you bud! 
---
Insult bot was at Helvetia. At the beginning of the parade it was following the other robots saying "wait". Isult bot did not cross the narrow wooden bridge though it just stood at the bridge. Sad
---
Can confirm, was unable to work for three years and spent all my time playing Overwatch 
---
Stash weights were determined for server stability. That's why they started out at 400 and gradually increased. There's no inherent advantage for a low level player having the same stash as a high level one.
---
Managed to do this yesterday after trying for ages. You need to go to the river by dyer chemical when heart of the swamp is one. The buds of the creepers are glowing and you can pick them for strangler bloom. 
---
You can shoot an injection or pop a pill a lot faster than you can smoke a cigarette. Kinda makes sense that those don’t need an animation.
---
Lol you feel me right
---
Just looking at their backs..... /r/trypophobia/ 
---
I mean yeah it a perfect world it shouldn’t have a cap.
---
I had to put the game up for a bit after that.
---
Yeah they 100% don't exist bud, long time trader here. Honestly don't think any legendary gamma gun is worth anything as they are barely superior to a regular one as only the phys portion of it's damage is affected. So many people wasting caps on AA gamma guns lol. It's a balance thing for sure, like how double/quad black powder weapons don't exist either. Maybe executioner is the best but like I said the difference will be minimal
---
Yeah let’s just say I know a hidden gem location to get so much tech 🤫
---
Yeah I've had flawless runs, no difference in the loot though. Can't confirm that the health contributes to anything, but Bethesda confirmed that keeping all bots alive does increase the chances. Whatever they are. 
---
Although you originally replied to a post regarding difficulty getting caps, you mentioned being over-weight and just walking around to deal with it. DumSkidderik expressed confusion over the fact that you and others consider walking everywhere for the entire game just because you're holding too much stuff.
---
None of the stuff you have, especially at your level, is difficult to obtain. After all that's why you have so much of it.
---
Why bother holding it all if you can get it easily at any time?
---
yes
---
Power armor sucks for pvp. When you start understanding that you will be on your way to not being one shitted by slightly less noobs
---
Death Rambo has a Christmas one as well
---
Its ok if it have a cap, right? you are not ending with all shit that u found in 2 weeks time. But right now, when Survival appear, Bethesda should rethink this and make no cap for adv mode and low cap for survi
---
What about drinking an entire bottle of something, or eating a steak?
---

Grushnak/90sMemolord Kicks small children off the bike and smells on the saddle afterwards...

At least he kinda has a good ending in his second holotape once he’s grown up
---
I've had a duplicate BoS Initiate paint plan, back when that was the only one you could get from technical data. Can't say whether the behaviour changed when they unlocked the other paints.
---
Yup, I guess I should search first. It was just so exciting!  
---
Source on Bethesda comments?

I love how you just have a way with words. Like a modern poet. Beautiful,
---
Go at night. Strangler pods turn into strangler blooms at night. Just NW of dyer chemical where the gulpers spawn in the water. The trees in the water have the strangler pods on the red roots. 
---
prototype is a color, just remove the paint
---
Good news, his grown-up corpse is in Flatwoods.  He became a Responder and helped children who had lost their families 
---
Smoking is bad for you.
---
Cave crickets definitely. Even at lvl89 I run from those little hellspawn. They don’t die just multiply. 
---
The point that you take a workshop you are agreeing to consensual pvp in whatever form that pvp takes. Don’t want to pvp? Turn on pacifist a d don’t take workshops. Don’t blame people for being smarter than you. You do know that you can sneak and avoid being detected on the map right? One button prevents you from easily being found and you are too dense to use it. You are the one that does not understand. You complain in an attempt to change game mechanics because you are not good enough for consensual pvp. That makes no sense to me. 
---
Thx. The same has your mum already said to me today
---
Yeah.
---
I'm 56. 2 of my 3 kids smoke. My wife and my ex-wife both smoke. My sister and her husband both smoke. That makes it so much harder to quit mentally. The only time I seriously tried to quit, my blood pressure went through the roof. We lost my Dad to cancer in 2007 and I seriously tried to quit after he passed. My Mom has serious health issues and mine isn't the greatest either. I've had 11 spinal surgeries, 4 right shoulder surgeries, a triple heart bypass surgery, 3 confirmed strokes and 2 unconfirmed ones. My left kneecap is broken in two and I have had debridement on it like 5, maybe 6 times over the years. I've been clinically dead 3 times and came back on my on. I'm a walking talking enigma that shouldn't even be here by all medical accounts. I have the very beginnings of COPD, but apparantly the smoking has not made that worse. I have bloodwork and a chest x-ray every 3 months and other than naturally occurring hardening of the bronchial heads, my lungs are in great shape. All of this is why at 56, I get to sit around and play video games all day. I'm a freaking trainwreck, so why get my blood pressure up at this point in the game? I appreciate your faith in me. I just wish I had it in me. 
---
When the event ends, I'm often amused by how pretty much everyone starts staring at their Pip-Boys.  A bit too much like how people check their phones these days.
---
They upped the prices of everything when they put all the recipes and plans on the vendors
---
 Remove the paint ... but you can't put it back. ;)
---
That's what happens you camp next to Charleston train station and keep the rare Responder Vendor Bot from spawning. A kitten dies every single time.
---
Haha, I'm glad it hasn't been just me.
---
I guess my question is better asked as, “Are there regular plans or does every X-01 start out as prototype?”
---
His name is Dogmeat right?...
---
Everything not robotic pops for me. Bloody mess at max level and a quick switchblade pretty much carves enemies into bite sized pieces.
---
The focus of this game seems to be shifting toward PVP.  I see it here on reddit, I see it in my own team. I wanted to launch a nuke last night and had to do it by myself because my team members were more interested in starting fights with other players.  I left the team because they were starting shit with people and  I've had my nuke launches fucked up in the past because they initiated PVP with random strangers which also made me a target and I got killed because I have the highest level which means I am worth the most caps. 
---
After launching the nuke and killing the queen, I logged off for the night unusually early and haven't logged on at all tonight.   The shift in focus to PVP has turned me off of the game, but that isn't the only thing. It's little things here and there that have been adding up over time. 
---
The game's terrible RNG is another problem. I don't know why getting a pair of X01 calibrated shocks should be near impossible. It's not some OP item that gives you an advantage in PVP or PVE.  Making these items hard to get seems like a cheap gimmick to keep you playing the game, but it has the opposite effect on me: it makes me not want to play.
---
Thanks, I felt pretty silly once it all came together.
---
So to do this I'm assuming it still requires a friend or something to get you back on that server? I'm not up on all the technical aspects of f76.
---
I think they should create quests that are level capped and unlock on achieving the level. Part of the rewards of said quests is an increase in stash weight. 
---
Sound doesn’t travel through space very well so we had to bring the whole station down to crank out some fat jams.
---
I've actually held on to some of my obsolete armor in the hope that I might display it eventually.
---
Of course, that said, I have my doubts that it would free up the Stash in any way, unless they did a similar thing like they do with CAMP vegetables versus inventory vegetables.
---
I've seen pictures of people glitching inside, it's just empty. There is nothing there yet. The locked doors are placeholders for whatever use they will have in the future
---
I found the Jester (Man) Mask in an open safe in the wrecked bank (location New Appalachian Central Trainyard). Tried to recreate it but only a pillow now spawns in its place. Hopefully this works for others. 
---

Yeah, I couldnt remember the actual price though. plus I normally have hard bargin equiped because I keep forgetting to lone wonder back on XD.
---
I put artillery up by FSP for the Scorched Earth Event. My gripe is its damage per mortor. Im not  asking for orbital strike damages, but at least buff them a little bit. 
---
Be careful who's stash's you loot! hahaha.
---
after lvl 50 u can choose to move 1 point from your stats or get new card.
---
Also u can get more stat points by mutations, alcohol, drugs etc ...but your max amount to spend on cards is always 15
---
Just wait for the rewards to drop for the event and the body should have turned into a meat pile by then.
---
10/10 works everytime for me. 
---
There always a market for it. I’m thinking of setting up an energy weapons one. The rng works someone will need/want that paint. 
---
Anti-armor and VATS crits are the only effective means to take down those Sentinel Assassin's or Sentinel Cavalier's wearing guys so I hope you're packing some serious AA to deal with those griefers - they're all wearing it. They're scared of any real challenge. 
---
Would you mind terribly if we opened a chat? I’d love to have all these comments of yours in one place, you can message me every morning then when you wake up, and every night when you think of me.
---
That's what I was afraid of. Seems like the best effects for it are probably fire-rate and reload speed, or the VATS improving ones. And even then those would only make it a bit better than a non-legendary.
---
It's a pity Gamma Guns don't seem to benefit much from being legendary, but on the bright side at least now I don't need to agonize over getting the perfect legendary Gamma Gun.
---
&gt; - The Mistress of Mystery Quest .... just brilliant!
---
Ah, I see you are a ~~man~~ mistress of culture as well.
---
But yeah, a lot of people blame the game for things that are part of the game design and not bad by itself. In Dark Souls for example a lot of the story is told by the items, armor, and weapon descriptions or even just the location (find a corpse near a certain spider with a certain tome? That's a whole story right there).
---
I've never seen anyone complain about not enough robot NPCs, or about all the station robots of the same faction having the same personality instead of talking about the nearby town (luckily the other vendors have all unique lines and personality). A lot of people don't really listen to what the NPCs say anyway.
---
No
---
Yes since loot random you just have to kill level 50 monsters that have legendary spawn with them and do that over and over and over and over and over again many many many times. Server hopping White Springs is the fastest method I found
---
Absolutley
---
I guess I will try it then! Jsut need to get elder I guess.
---
Even before level 50, you don't have to take a perk card in the SPECIAL that you raised. You can scroll left/right through different sets after selecting the SPECIAL.
---
How Bethesda didn't think this was worthy of a hint box, I have no idea.
---
Nope. 
---
Question: If you unequip the perk, does the ability to have that dog stay tamed, go away? 
---
Also there are other bos PA paints?
---
I see a lot of people wanting the special paintjobs so yeah, I think it would work out for you. 
---
That's actually really helpful I'll keep that in mind next time I run in to one of those things thanks👍👍
---
If you buy the Pilsner from a vendor it counts as crafting it for the quest. You can usually get it from the bar in whitesprings
---
i sad now
---
Better late than never. 😇
---
But really, if you take a step back and try to understand Fallout 76 on its own terms, instead of feverishly trying to draw comparisons to previous Fallouts, you should begin to realize why it made the choices it did.
---

---
How much would you give for a full set of 3* unyielding BOS combat armor? 
---
Are you serious??? I had no idea, sigh.
---
Do not worry, I just write under each comment you make a few words of love. Then everyone can share in our relationship
---
Me too.  I am a power fist user, and I would love to have one of those extending clown boxing glove skins for it to go along with the clown outfit and fascnact man mask. 
---
I'd pay money for that. 
---
lol the advertisements for this event are bullshit
---
Chainsaws, drills, and rippers all need to be able to reach level 45/50 first. There's just no reason to have them be below level max.
---
I'm on PC.  GT Schmity78
---
Rifles are really and always good. I have an instigating one and love it. 
---
I found him today and he kept telling me to stop. He didn't insult me so I killed him but every time I shot him, my luck of the draw perk would activate (I've got it maxed out too) so in about 5 shots I fully repaired my shotgun
---
I think every one that you craft starts out as prototype. You have to manually go into a PA workbench and change the prototype paint back to standard for it to look like the regular one.
---
Kinda kinky, but I’m into that kind of shaming so go for it. Or of curiosity and on an unrelated matter are you a tall guy or a short guy, I’m mostly into chicks but I do have my type and it could help with getting me in the mood.
---
Getting pretty tired of everything being a grind.
---
The animations that they have added to the game I've found were pretty good, arguably higher quality than Fallout 4's. The only thing that makes them a little awkward is the lack of facial animations.
---
What's an example of good loot from these? I've always gotten garbage.
---
Of course if you abuse this shit you're not going to understand what's wrong with it.
---
You must be right and everyone else is wrong.
---
Do tell
---
I don't like your build but I hope it works for you. I need maximum damage, even if that means I have 40HP. I can fo 1300 damage with my dragon, double that if sneaking. I have unyielding armor so I have high specials, so I can vats like crazy and have the gun fu perk to jump targets quickly. I'm a glass cannon on steroids and coffee.

Oki got it...TOMMAROW attack of pokemonpro183 ... damn em i ready?
---
Run the event at the prison where you gotta defend the security robot.  It'll give you the lever plan
---
Bah unlucky u...if i ever encounter any legendary lever rifle will give u a shout xD Wot lvl are u? 
---
So does the steelheart event
---
At least until you become strong, I'd agree that the isolation works in the game's favor.  When you're in a place like The Mire, and you're Level 30, hopelessly outmatched, there's a feeling that's unlike any previous Fallout.  This actually feels *dangerous*.  Like I'm not supposed to be here.  And there's nothing between me and whatever exists in the fog, or behind that tree.
---
The same is true of Scorchbeasts.  They will destroy you early on.  You either have to go around them or run away (sadly, many players prefer to server hop instead).  But it's in those moments that 76 really shines.  This is a wasteland that is legitimately out to kill me, where fight-or-flight is real, and cunning can be more important than raw strength.
---
nope, once they are tamed the perk isn't needed any longer. 
---
I want to know this as well
---
Autocorrect is a bitch.
---
I’d love this! Robot crafting is something I really wish was in the game. The taming system is far from perfect, but I would take that over nothing.
---
I’ve been thinking of doing a silo run, just havent had the team for jt. If you are looking for a +1
---
You should be able to buy the plans from either Grafton or Harper's Ferry and then you can make as many as you want.
---
I’m level 32. This is the pinnacle of bad day.
---
Perma stealth tho right?
---
Sentinel is the only paint that doesn’t exists yet.
---
Drop rates are perfect. 1 drop per 10,000 playthroughs. Whatever you don't get just trade for it!
---
Thanks guys!
---
Thank you! I hope it works out!

---
I have never done it. I take workshops a lot. I don’t run around the map advertising myself if I own one or more workshops. I am not that dense. It is not a logical leap that a pvp team may hunt you even before challenging your workshop claim. 
---
I hate being a turd but this conversation is ridiculous. Don’t invite pvp if you can’t handle pvp
---
Use the action boy perk and max it out it’ll make your AP regen faster 
---
Didn’t even know there was one. 
---
This is why my friends and I haven’t played in about two months. We all love fallout and we had fun in the beginning but the gameplay for 76 turned into more chores and resource grinding than what we wanted. Now we all play 4 while talking to each other lol
---
See you later, I have to leave your little sister waiting for me now
---
Yo, you best not be yankin my chain boy, I ain't bout no chain yankin, ya hear?!
---
xD nah you are only 32 u will find a dozens rifles by lvl 100. If u want u can add me to friends so i can run u thru some places tommorow
---
Are you on now?  I can make you one
---
With all the demo perks, and a well placed shot, my Two shot Fatman can drop a Lvl:50 scorch beast instantly. I love it. Lol. 
---
Rifle.  Handmades, levers, and dragons.  hard to compete 
---
VillainesSarah on psn if you are
---
Well I would honestly tell you but I don’t want Bethesda ruining the location by nerfing the amount of technical data in that location. Basically I don’t want it to be the new sugar grove .
---
You having a cry about downvotes? wasn't me mate, already said what I had to, sometimes shit hits the fan and you have to jump up, it's rare, sure, but you can't just assume everyone is being a douchelord holding up the vendors.
---
lol 
---
In Gothic you could smoke joints. There was even a small quest in gothic 1 in which you had to smoke three different kinds from the three different tribes. And your game character actually got high from them.
---
Yeah I got a nocturnal gamma gun on me to 1 shot the glass cannon cannon builds lol I don’t like being countered that easily, so suppressors perk + suppressors legendary = -50% damage, then dodgy from agility for another -30%, resistances, high endurance and life giver all while I can more then likely do normal damage.
---
I like my build style lol.
---
I lost count over 10 hand ins.  Probably between 15 and 20. 
---
wow must have seen that fucker in slow motion.  
---
It has to be bugged.Bethesda dont give a fuck.People sayings its super rare lol.
---
Guy's name checks out. Whether he just brags about it or actually does everything he says, though, is a pretty sad use of one's time if you ask me
---
Nope. I’ve used it plenty. Every hit. 
---
I've had one DC, but I think I know the cause. We had 20 people running the event and everyone was shooting at the sloth and one guy had set camp with missile launchers on the hill above and another launched a mininuke at it. DCed right after I saw it hit.
---
i have a bloodied 44.
---
I have a lvl 50 3* Supressors Deathclaw for sale. 40% bonus to power attack, 
---
But I know Grushnak/90sMemolord Kicks small children off the bike and smells on the saddle afterwards...
---
That is how it works and it is not OP. You can use a combination of perks to get damage taken reduced by 90%. There are also perks that increase damage give by 400-600%.
---
A 50 damage weapon could do 250-300 damage. Decreasing that dame by 90% brings it down to 25-30 damage. 
---
Not OP
---
I believe its additional or better loot after u finish
---
Sweet! I haven't even used the perk yet, but I want a pet really bad. I miss my dogmeat damn it. 
---
you get like 20 percent more rewards when you filling fix the power plant so not really worth it. 
---
Flatwoods at the crossroads near the church and bridge
---
For real man the mire was quite possibly the creepiest fallout area I’ve ever been in a fallout game. I couldn’t see 2 feet in front of me. Everything was way overpowered compared to level 30 me. Now that I’m 69 I enjoy slaughtering everything that gave me problems at lower levels.
---
I popped inside and it looks to be just legs.
---
Maybe it's gotten better. I haven't even tried to log on in 3 or 4 weeks.
---
r/trypophobia is one of my fav subs. It freaks me out/I love it. 
---
The mothelode quest in Charleston can give one. 
---
I dont PvP,  because caps go flying out the window. Just awhile ago today I was trading with someone and was adding a mod to their armor and they were running around meleeing with a powerfist and hit a bystander. Guess what? He got instant killed, and because I was on the team was instant killed too because I hesitated to kill, out of moral. Lost 150 caps because I didn't want to fight and instigated nothing.
---
i see your getting no bites.  Figure ill let you know the going rate is \~250 caps
---
Oh snap, forgot all about that! I even grabbed the Holotape from him and everything, at some point or another. Been a while since I explored Flatwoods all that much.
---
Put it right on that path leading from the overseers camp towards flat woods. New players are bound to take that path. There’s also a random encounter spot there as well
---
Ahh, your one of the legendary few who can demolish queens lol, I salute you man 
---
Bye, Felicia.
---
I hate when I'm out of smokes irl and I can't get any till the next a.m. but I have to look at them every where! As many cigarettes that are laying around I'm starting to believe everyone died from smoking the day before the nukes!
---
Much appreciated. I've been looking for more than their cookie cutter response from the beginning. 
---
I'd pay to get that red/black paint on my T60 ❤️ 
---
He should carry a pencil with him. When the person dies, grab their loot and leave a single pencil loot bag in its place.
---
We need to prepare to repel these raider attacks! Everyone gather books and intelligence bobbleheads!
---
It was awful.. somehow the damn thing dodged all of the explosive rounds to get a hit in.. we won, but felt defeated
---
I can't *not* complete it. It'd be like leaving an office fan behind.....
---
Not quite. No invisibility, and I don't have all detection perks. I'm trying to get them to fit my layout. It's nice having speed demon and 28-34 agility though. They see me rolling, they hatin', how slow they are.
---
March 9th, like in a year? There's new storyline/dungeons dropping in like 1 month, that was I think the main part to the new DLC roadmap.
---
Fallout 76 really has no endgame no story and no purpose.More of an exploration game like no mans sky.I know people have great stories about specific moments they experienced with other players but they can also be experienced in many other better online games.
---
Well if they are not immune to Explosives my Auto Grenade Launcher with all the trimmings will make the area I'm in difficult. I just shoot it at my feet or between us. I can get a few feet that way sometimes but its not a useful rocket jump. Clears the area. ;)
---
 My knives pack a lot of AA. 
---
&gt;I am a bad boy raider. Bad to da bone.
---
[Sure, Jan.](https://media.women.com/images/images/000/075/809/large/giphy-1.gif?1488848990)
---
I'd say that's a reasonable debuff by Bethesda's standards, assuming that it refreshes rather than stacking. Consider that with shotgun + Enforcer you can trivially neutralize the strongest melee enemies. Or the many ways to be invisible.
---
The question with Suppressor and Tenderizer is whether they stack with others players. Say you have five different players using them in a queen fight.
---
I try, but I haven't fought a queen after the nerf yet. Just got full Unyielding armor. Was previously PA only scrub just a week ago.
---
When does the vendor come out?
---
I launched  a mini nuke at a frozen sloth and that fixed the problem lol. Too bad all anybody got was a vanguard wooden left leg lol
---
Well I guess I’ll be the contrary in here and say that I miss the interaction with NPCs and I think it hurts the game. One of the more irritating parts of the game is that you’re constantly going around trying to save her contact people are doing quests and everybody’s dead. Like all of these people just decided that they were going to build up these elaborate plans in the hopes that someday someone is going to come along and follow it to a T even though everyone they know died trying to just get these things off the ground.  I don’t think it ruins the game in anyway but a lot of the questions just seem to be a little weak because of that reason. I mean what’s the point of being a part of these factions that don’t even exist anymore. 
---
It might be because I am 100% solo player and it makes the game feel pretty lifeless because I don’t interact with a lot of other people and many of the interactions I’ve had have been negative with Griefers and just general assholes.  That being said I do like the random interactions with other players that I do have some times and one of my favorite things to do is to swoop in and help low-level players who are just about to get their ass kicked.  I do love this game I just wish it was a lot more lively with NPCs or companion characters.
---
5 bots full health = owl 
---
2 dead bots = owl mask 
---
Fck logic i guess hahaha I did manage to already have a collection of 20 of each ( of course figuratively speaking ) and almost 3 of each plans including the little bonfire and 3 berets 
---
Would you take 5k? 
---
maybe because its not MMO? Lol why Fo76 is even compared to ESO here? Fo76 is more like a solo/coop game with possibility of encountering other players. With so many servers its more like good old Diablo 2 with its servers 
---
Well I have it! Just not elder. Tbh I’m not sure what else rlooks like.
---
I get more excited to see a room filled with desk fans than I do to loot a scorchbeast
---
Hahaha😂 I'm loving this idea, except for the fact that a dog would have to die😣
---
I’m assuming they will be for atomic winter and I’m guessing it will be the entire ( or most parts of the map ) covered in the sea of glow ( hence nuclear winter )
---
I remember after the event I went to Sutton train station to sell some stuff to make extra carrying space. This level 22 guy came right after and I gave him like 5 or 6 random plans I had that I didn’t need. He messaged me after saying I was the first person he met on the game to do anything friendly like that. Made me kinda sad honestly
---
It would be great if we could use the dart board, watch TV, change the station on the radio, drive a car, own a dog, and so much more
---
God yes the holes on Radtoads' backs freak me me the fuck out. So gross. 
---
I'm not sure the name of it, just know it looks amazing. Lol. 
---
Yes, basically that data. I don't particularly care about video recording, because that'll be no more accurate than what you're writing (anything that's going to be inaccurate is going to be because of the necessity of polling for data). But I am curious about the actual info used, and surprised you don't just append a view only link to a google doc with said data.
---
 I am a creature of the Mire. My home and where I prowl about. I am an Apex Predator but there are others and we respect each other ... mostly.
---
 I have gone native. ;)
---
Didnt know u can still encounter mothman...it was weeks when i saw last one. ;/ Lucky u bro
---
It isn't that well known though i did some research and testing and saw it happened to some people here on reddit too. We came to the conclusion that it must be the tesla rifle and hoped for a fix in the energy weapons update. Same bug happened to explosive legendary weapons, but got fixed when explosives got nerfed i guess. I dropped using tesla rifles months ago and never had this problem with any other weapon.
---
If the bug occurs you can still use melee, so at least you can clear of remaining enemies before switching server. 
---
Ya I was like “wtf”
---
It used to be if you had a pack in your inventory, then idle your character they would take a smoke.  
---
&gt;Power armor sucks for pvp. 
---
I see this argument a lot. If true, then it's  a seriously broken game mechanic. 
---
If a small handful of builds are invincible against other builds that are completely useless, then the game isn't worth playing, a conclusion that I am regretfully coming to.  
---
Why would i smoke my best source of that sweet sweet plastic?
---
It really depends strongly on what type of build your character is running. I run a melee build with power armor. My only ranged weapon is a shot gun and Gatling gun (both prime) which are used exclusively for Scorchbeast Queen events. 
---
I REALLY wish we had an option to blueprint our perk specs as I have 2-3 specific perk card setups that I use consistently with very little change. One is for combat and the other is for fast traveling/non-combat camp maintenance. 
---
I equip all slugger perks, which adds 60% damage when engaging in combat, which is 9 strength points. Followed by Incisor and Traveling Pharmacy as I carry an obscene amount of stimpacks and rad away. Then change to Strong Back, and other carry weight ones whey fast traveling back. 
---
You’ll get used to it. Just remember to switch back after you use the perk.  
---
Patience is good.
---
Paladin or officer.
---
May Atom show you mercy for spreading that filth.
---
I said thats what I wanted for a Fallout online game.There were rumors of a Fallout mmo years ago too.
---
I am running similar build, I just want the int perks to reduce power core usage.
---
Sent!
---
Odd since NPCs would smoke cigs in fo4.
---
New Vegas as well iirc.
---
Or you could play as an enforcer for the little newbies, checking in the lower level players and dropping armor chassis and stims at their camps. Be a raider for a week, and see how many times you become wanted. I'm always amused by the 'now what do I  do?' posts. Experiment a bit. Jump off that tall bridge without PA but full of Med-X, bird bones, and goat legs. Get Aquaboy and wander around the lakes looking for hidden loot. Grief only warehouse styled buildings and leave only the front door standing. Set yourself a quota of Supermutants to kill per day. Make the game fun for yourself, rather than expect someone else to entertain you. Have a go at something different play wise 
---
I understand you get bored but what end game did fallout 4 have? Skyrim?  Wasn't really much to do after you beat them either.  Just kinda explore or build a different character.  Not many games keep your interest for years and years.  Hopefully the next dlc will be more expansive and keep us going for a while.
---
This is a little different tho.  This is a mmo so they should have had raid and dungeons launch with the game.  But they seem to be in the plans.  They must have und er estimated how quickly people would get through everything and decided not to realise them at launch.  It was also the first fallout mmo so hopefully they learn from this.
---
I appreciate the offer but thats not enough for a full matching set 
---
If that happened though, players who focused on camps and workshops will have a very low cap.
---
There was Fallout MMO years ago my good sir. Fallout 2 Mod that let u play with other people ;P  but yeah as i said F76 cant be taken as a full fledged MMO, its only Coop game, and its a good coop if u have a good coop team. Thats only my idea of playing but i believe there are people who enjoy soloing it
---
How much you want then?
---
Yes but you can stand in it and close the door and then take your seat upon the Great greenish-blue throne!
---
sharing is caring! great spot to dump known plans, unneeded legendary, etc. like OP, paper bags of gifts is my favorite part.
---
How?
---
if you wait long enough, the sloth will become a meat pile and you can loot it
---
(Have a legendary Handy Saw with Vampirism)...... this is Good Enough....
---
Plus I don’t know what you all think but I have seen Drills at Lvl 45-50 and legendary Ripper (scorched)
---
Though can’t say I have seen this Chainsaw yet. (Then again there is likely a lot each of us had not seen.) 
---
Commonly met surprised people with my Super Jump Mutantion.
---
No, but you put it in the first spot I'd check. High ground, covered - always check there first. Best to put your mat someplace completely unexpected. 
---
Wow really wish I knew that earlier
---
I'm speaking above and beyond what we've already got. I'm sure many people who aren't collecting everything they see are reasonably happy with the 800 stash limit. 
---
Maybe it could be a less radioactive, more snowy winter? I know that the winter overhauls are some of the most popular downloads on the nexus and Bethesda's mod page. Maybe they're trying to do something different since this game is close enough to the bombs falling to still have drastic abnormalities in how seasons work? I don't know, but that would be a cool time to be able to get the PA skins.
---
You have to kill him.
---
This is gonna suck when that new legendary level system comes in and people rage about having to reset levels
---
If parents simply cared about being parents they wouldent buy their kids a m rated game in the first place. Instead most parents want their kids to like them. I however see things differently. I dont give a shit if my kids like me. I dont censor, but they do as they are told, and I dont allow them to smoke, drink, ect until they are old enough and if they do and get caught it's on them, not me. I'm not nice about rule breaking but respect their privacy and lives. It's a simple concept. As a parent it's my job to raise a contributing member of society that can hold a job, knows right from wrong, and is not a criminal. As long as I accomplish that, anything more is a bonus and so far, 5 children in with three raised to be adults, they all are law abiding productive people. I did my job. This notion that parents are meant to be some kind of friend to their children is foolish
---
i really wish there was some sort of cocktail that requires a single bullet.  
---
have it increase ballistic damage (or resistance)
---
I know how you feel my friend. Fortunately, there will be an update stopping this kind of griefing making it so people can only attack if you attack back. Till then, hang in there, focus on the good people, not the bad and good luck out in the wastes!
---
True. However balancing pvp is probably not on Beth’s short list of todo items. It is just a fact that power armor sucks for pvp. When and if they make legendary power armor that will likely flip power armor being the better build. Claiming a workshop in power armor lets any pvper that happens a long know that you are an easy target. A level 25 pvp spec and equipped build could mitigate more damage than a level 200 in power armor. 
---
Well, something like that but not completely. I've been having a terrible time looking for good places to base at and i'm sure other people have too. it's not easy finding flat ground in Appalachia. Basically, it's just to share where we think players can base for a decent experience when they return to their camp. not like many people will see this post anyway. probably?
---
 Yeah. I like to kill Harper's Ferry once a day, then go chat with Wallace. ;)
---
I hate you so much. I’m not clicking that. 
---
Something doesn't add up here... I've spent an inordinate amount of time actually taming and testing tamed animals and the only ones that have been tame-able are single event spawned creatures.
---
I heard the spawn spot South of lady Janet's soft serve is a better one.
---
In Australia here, same thing. Was fine before now it's fucked. DC and crashes to bluescreen on ps4
---
+karma hope this helps dude!  😁
---
Lol quite the transformation man.
---
I started playing again when this event started and had no idea what was going on. I ended up with the owl mask and was ecstatic because i like owls. So i haven't really been tempted to go back since haha.
---
Oh yea, I had it in inventory.  Plus it did cost caps when I bought it.
---
Dont have photo right now, sadly u are probably not on ps4 so i cant show u...but yeh my place is probably best since my house been there for 2 weeks without any problem...and rocket turrets are doing a good job against lvl 1 scorched ;P
---
I may be incorrect about a few things but there's nothing according to the data about that. I'm wrong about the taming mechanic. Those races all apply to the pacify mechanic of it. Someone pointed me the right way to help me find the correct information. I'll update my post tomorrow with more info on how the data says the mechanic should work
---
You’re a lifesaver! Thanks for letting me have both!
---
Hmmm... the inferiors are worried about some raiders? Pathetic....
---
ah, yeah, i'm not on ps4. I kind of like the idea of putting my camp far east but that's just a hassle right now. Stash space troubles.
---
Hahaha, gonna burst your bubble even more. Multi star gamma guns will always have a secondary perk of limb damage and the third perk will always be a +1 stat like agility. Maybe I am mistaken but from memory that's all i've seen. I'm pretty positive on the secondary always being limb damage at least. So yeah, honestly they are strong anyway and definitely useful in PVP. Aim for an awesome radium rifle instead to accompany it instead :D 
---
Someone tried to sell me the Civil War Tophat plan for 10,000 caps. Like I want it but not that badly 
---
Hinted as a new game mode that one makes my mind go wild imagine having to either have to be on hazmat suit and or power armor 
---
noob
---
And my bow
---
At those rates it sounds like I have to trade in my soul. 
---
Nice! 👍
---
Join ' I Squanch Daily', i'm building my new camp atm. I'll give it to you for free or some junk. Like copper and circuitry
---
I simply dont trade with people. Every player I run across wants to trade but it's usually lower level players and they have nothing I want so I just give them the ammo and armor I dont want if they catch me before I sell the armor
---
The silllllllver rush! Feel the rush of a warm laser in your hand.
---
What kind of pervert are you that you close the door *after* you sit down? No one wants to see that! :p 
---
I’d buy from you
---
Super low odds of getting a rare mask is all. They're there, it's just hyper-rare loot. I'll be excited to try for them a couple more times and if not, maybe better luck next year!
---
Thanks for this! Can’t wait to check it out!
---
Missing one by the overseer's camp.
---
I don’t see how anyone gets one shotted with pacifist on. Slap damage mitigates like 95% of damage. Other perks will mitigate that even farther. I have low level alts that have taken slap damage from a variety of pvpers without an issue. You either had a sliver of health left, were wanted, stood there while being continually attacked, or had activated pvp somehow. 
---
It is pretty common be hit at a vendor if you are taking too long. They are telling you to hurry up. If a few people are hitting you with slap damage then you will die eventually. 
---
This was helpful, thanks.
---
Bethesda has said they're exceedingly rare, but the drop rates are correct. The rate that is accepted right now is .03% chance of getting one of them. 
---
Good luck
---
I’ve just recently been going back through the low level areas for exploration.  Flatwoods and Morgantown have so much going on when you look.  The Morgantown History holotape series was especially interesting to collect 
---
I have never seen a drill past level 20, i have had high level legendary rippers but they're still awful
---
He told me to have a nice day.
---
It is honestly. Tin man to cardboard covered in box blades.
---
Bloodied build with sentinel assassin's armor. Power armor is trash for PVP. 
---
Addiction? Pfft. If you're always drunk, you can't suffer the side effects...
---
Wack 
---
I currently can’t be on right now. I don’t usually like to give my gamertag but I do group posts instead m. Come by tomorrow possibly!
---
Anybody find these since the latest updates that added all plans to vendors?
---
These are the only two (non-atom shop) items I do not have for the camp.
---
Atleast 200 for the extreme hardcore players going for these please bethesda, 
---
Absolutely.  If I come across a legendary lever I'll holler your way
---
Word haha I'd be stoked to just see some one wearing one it game
---
I enjoyed the game after I quit trying to do quests. It’s probably just me but that way I can read terminals , look around  etc. 
---
For all you lvl50+ Xbox players. Always check the blue suitcase in Watoga Station, the adjacent Cooler, and the Tool Chest at the foot of the pinball machine. I leave Legendaries, Plans, Mods and Ammo in the first; Stimpaks go in the second; and Scrap goes in the third.
---
I try to leave stuff that isn't just trash-tier wood armor or ivory grips.
---
Well pkayer vending was in the game at the time of E3 too
---
I’m saying in the near future, are you able to do the prototype xo1 or can everyone do that?
---
Ask for thoughts, downvotes anyone who disagrees.. yeah sounds like a great strategy to encourage discussion lol. Stick to PvE bruh
---
Getting the owl was honestly good enough for me too! I've had plenty of fun besides
---
And that night you dismantled your turrets.  You rather be eaten by mole miners than hurt another kitten who just lost its mother and looking for a new forever home.
---
That is indeed interesting
---
It could be a couple if builds. Bloody is popular. AAE can also destroy power armor easily. 
---
Yup. I was in a server for over an hour and got booted, same as it used to be. Now I server hop every 30 min or so to avoid it
---
you know you are just robots right
---
Oh shoot, so it might be another version like "survival". That sounds pretty awesome, I'd love for more of a Dust/Frost type experience to be available for hardcore survival aspects.
---
The one and only. 
---
There’s a glitch currently on game where all food is going spoil at extremely fast rate. This glitch also affects your hunger and thirst energy lvls.  You would of think Bethesda would off corrected this issue as soon they learn of it on last week’s hot fix patch after releasing the Biv daily quest for mixed alcoholic drinks.
---
It's the same bloodied build everyone pretends they came up with on their own. probably a mix of sentinal armor, assassin's armor, unyielding armor, and a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. He's doing thousands of damage at 75% armor pen minimum with incisor. Actual cancer 
---
Stick to it! You may feel shitty now, but i promise the rest of your life, youll feel a trillion times better. 
---
Atleast make a turn in system for the masks, 75 for a rare or something idk
---
You get the prototype paint as soon as you learn the plans to make X-01.
---
I know how slap damage is *meant* to work, but this would be far from the first time I've heard of it breaking. I was at full health, in pacifist mode (as stated) and only heard a single hit. Even if your above assumptions were correct it wouldn't explain how they were able to kill me in one hit the other times I wasn't engaging in combat
---
They’re like the supply drops - helpful at early levels but mostly useless at higher levels. 
---
and we could just know out your internal data base and you're gone
---
That's why I've been stockpiling the event consumables, especially intestines.
---
I want to get a team set up to do a Whitesprings raid deal. Kill all the robots in the place, while stabbing the bejesus outta the robots, someone else deals to the turrets. Kinda a suicide mission with the robots respawning all the time, but seeing how long a team of 4 can last.
---
I am the same way. I would die for my animals, and I would and have killed for them as well. The killing was of a dog that was basically feral because the owner just let it roam. It killed one of my dogs before escaping when my neighbor went out and hit it with a bat. A buddy of mine from around the corner was a deputy sheriff so the two of us found this chow and shot it with my xbow. I then left it on its owner's porch. He had been warned by the county multiple times for the dog's aggressive behavior. I felt bad for that dog also as had its owner actually cared for it, it would have been a beautiful animal. 
---
Vendor has more spawn spots?
---
As long as you learned the plan, sure. You can swap paint jobs.
---
Just had some asshole do this to my wife and I with an axe. Hit him with 2 mini nukes after he one shot us trying to get my junk back and nothing. He turns around and one shots me in xo1 armor. 
---
It doesn’t tho
---
on the way
---
These posts are the new aggravating posts of this sub. 
---
Workshops are for consensual pvp. Some pvpers will use workshops to farm caps. If they are pvpers then they are specced and geared to kill your excavator armor wearing character. You do not have to take workshops. However, if tou do take a workshop you are agreeing to CONSENSUAL pvp and some pvpers may farm you for caps. Ince again it is CONSENSUAL pvp and some players may farm you for caps. 
---
I randomly drop ammo, armor, missiles, grenades, and sometimes weapons at the flat woods church or sometimes at a new players feet, sometimes at the overseers camp. Usually in the cashe box 
---
Sometimes, especially if you're with a group, he'll spawn and shit-talk one of the people you're with a hand them a "you've been insulted" letter. It's downright hilarious when it works. 
---
I was just making a pun.  Ya know, BIT excessive...
---
My jokes often Byte, I know.
---
Because there are infinite queens and the PVP example you brought up is just as comparable if not severely less severe and often compared to other PVP exploits-durrr features currently going on right now which are more rampant. 
---
This is a game that was mismanaged and poorly influenced by marketing decisions. Duping, PVP exploits, etc.. are not anything new, but more experienced companies have developed effective strategies to counter these methods and do so hastily... not just change the max number of items you can carry by one two weeks later. Plus I reserve judgement to the idea of false positives. These are the same people who inadvertently gave out customer info, lied about bags, launch a game full of visible coding errors, every fix seems to break something else, etc.. Even in the case where a broken clock may be right two times a day, I could just never rely on for accurate information.  
---
I can ramble on, but it's more so the language and tone of such things is unpleasant and unnecessary. Reading it just makes me hesitant to even post anything because people whose egos are driven by pointless hostile activity are likely the same people who will call someone an idea if they just had a question or an idea. If you don't have anything nice to say, why bother at all?
---
Is your alt's armor shredded by the time you get to shot 10? Those are closer to the kind of numbers I'd expect if his armor was less than half health and furious was maxed. 
---
The reason he could kill you is someone in his party was contesting the workshop. Retaliation did no damage because they were no longer contesting. Sorry that happened to you, but beyond not claiming workshops, there's no preventing it.
---
Server hopping gives you a different mine, though, so you're spending money to fast travel to the new location... 
---
&gt;  However balancing pvp is probably not on Beth’s short list of todo items.
---
It had damn well better be. I went with a heavy weapons build. Power armor is a requirement for a heavy weapons build because of the Stabilized perk.  Stabilized ignores 45 percent of your opponents armor with heavy weapons, but it only works in power armor.  If power armor is useless in PVP, then it's not just power armor that's useless, but entire builds. 
---
Not everyone wants to be stealth melee or stealth sniper, and nor should they have to be just to be viable in PVP. 
---
Dont think anyone has acknowledged that you can now pick up all the WEIGHTS IN THE PENITENTIARY!! Been waiting for this since launch 😂 
---
These posts are getting old. Workshops are consensual pvp that you agree to. The game mechanics are fine considering everything else Beth needs to work on. Just because a game option exists to pvp does not mean you should select that option and then complain about the pvp. 
---
I legit wish cats couldn't be hurt in the game it kills me to even think about it. Like I can laugh at raiders being dismembered but a kitten? IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THIS KITTEN I WILL KILL EVERYONE IN APPALACHIA AND THEN MYSELF. 
---
Like in Fallout 4 there's that one settlement built below power lines. They have a cat and you can't target it with anything. 
---
That's what I want. 
---
Screw high level content: LET ME COLLECT AND PROTECT KITTENS. 
---
It’s a good game it’s just popular to hate it
---
I go where groups of high level people are. I punch them. They hit back. Boom. Caps stash. 
---
I have two Knight plans but I haven’t read any yet. 
---
Ok? Don't know why this post was necessary. Bye.
---
My total carry weight is currently 190lbs.  I’m not sure if this is low or OK for a lvl 31.  After weapons, armor, all my aid, and all my junk to keep my equipment going, I am constantly within 10lbs to my weight limit.  I try to manage what I am carrying, but it seems like I am bad at this.  The game is beautiful, so walking is really rewarding.  And I know that just wandering can help with leveling up and finding more useful things.  
---
Unfortunately, I have a difficult time finding basic junk/items/equipment even with the magnifying glass thingy turned on.  This is why I don’t just drop anything or sell it; finding it again if I am in need of it takes multiple hours
---
I have what I have on my character because feel that I am in constant need of having it on me so I can deal with situations as they rise.  I fully admit to not being very good at this, but at least I’m still having a lot of fun.
---
Alright well I might just buy a set for my new acc and need it painted
---
I'm not sure what you mean by shredded armor. I did tests with zero armor, and due to how much damage he was taking (well above listed damage, even on the first shot) I couldn't even get to 10 shots before he would have died.
---
With 60 armor from a power armor frame, that's when I was going from 11 damage at the start to 18-19 damage by shot 10
---
Intestines...
---
I guess if you hit events fast enough they last
---
idk, only had the failure problem once.
---
Anyways I think a big part of it is, at what point you find that bot.
---
The animals seem to spawn minutes after finding it? Idk just what ive seen.
---
But people tend to sit around *GRUMBLES LOUDLY* so... i partially chalk that failure to the nuke, other half to slow players and freeloaders
---
Seen lvl 50 Drills for sale at Harper's in the few times I have gone
---
(Would have gotten one my self... but didn't see a point ;p)
---
Your smart. Because I’m a kind of guy who needs to automatically learn something due to my excitement! Unlike me you have patience of getting another plan. 
---
Yes go to that ice cream shop and run South on the road past the bus, it will spawn there.
---
when you take a workshop you open yourself up to attack. when someone contest the workshop you are at ,you will take full damage. workshops are a areas that are in high demand so if someone wants whats there they can and will fight you for it. power plants give fusion cores and if someone wants them and you have the resource locked they have to fight you to get able to farm resources for themselfs. he can 1 shot you because he has a proper build for pvp and you don't and the reason he was taking no damage with you shot him with a mini nuke he because he has legendary armor that makes so he will take next to no damage from other players. he will looking to pvp and had the proper build and gear. when this happens its better to just server hop and not lose all your caps because they will kill you non stop unless you have the same build or a counter build. 
---
Space Jam
---
Recommend paladin. Awesome paint job and cool markings on the wrist!
---
It would be possible if you had a workshop. Theres a few posts explaining that exploit up atm.
---
Nah I’m the type who doesn’t read anything I can sell. I’m dumb and loaded. 
---
I haven't had the greatest of luck at either spot.
---
 I'm level 145 and have only seen him a handful of times
---
Basically if you own a workshop then if somone attacks you they do full damage BUT if you shoot them first you don't do full damage. It a a flawed system I'm afraid. 
---
Unless they attempt to take it from you then it is classed as your both in PVP. 
---
Workshops are ok but I wouldn't waste much time on them. you can make your own CAMP and make everything you can at workshop spare from fusion cores. 
---
Don't let it bother you just try and enjoy the game :)  
---
Is it a devil? I always called it a goblin.
---
No. My wife and I were in our workshop, at work stations. He walked up behind us and one shotted us. He did not, nor did any party members as he was alone, try to contest the workshop first. 
---
I couldn’t agree more, I was a avid Diablo 2 LOD player and this game reminds me a lot of it. Especially the grind to get rare legendary weapons and armor. I also find it very funny the way people are complaining about the mask drop % and how they say it is too low. I remember grinding for hours in Diablo 2 for certain items to never see them drop. 
---
I just want to stock my nukacola machine
---
Lol. I used to be like that once. I would kill scorchbeats queen and then forgot to learn the plans or just wait for me to sell them.
---
That's it, this is answer for everyone. But also i got second beret recently. I think I did not completed most tasks for the second one.
---
The inaccuracies that can occurred with polled data is in large part why I wanted to test it myself, too many trolls / griefers for me to take most things at face value.
---
Honestly your the first person who asked for anything but a video, I'll try to make a GoogleDocs going forward and add a link.
---
For this data was documented a little oddly, I used pen and paper for the "count" (old 4 lines and a hash) as I knew it was going to be a grind, ditched the excel file when once it became clear the the masks had more or less equal chances (common) and documented discrepancies as they popped up in a NotePad document with the relevant info at the time.
---
Once discrepancies repeated I then used pen and paper to keep count.
---
**Disclaimer:**
---
I was doing spakle work on my walls between each round of the quest, with 25 minute timers set to make sure I didn't afk out between events. (50'ish minutes was also about perfect timing between events as well).
---
Since all I cared about to begin with was the total number of events run between uncommons and rares at first, 
---
Yeah I am, I have been playing black desert online on xbox to occupy my time. Has been great having money in my wallet for once.
---
Try putting it one or the interior rooms you can lock, if someone is wanted at the factory, you’ve been compromised.  
---
Great! Good luck my friend!
---
The giant ticks give me the creeps, but I’d say the scariest enemies that I avoid more than anything are mirelurk queens in 76.
---
Centaurs have to be the worst in the overall continuity.
---
It totally is. Sentinel armor is - 15% while standing still. Assassin's is - 8% from players. 5 pieces with both is 23 x 5, but it caps at 95% or 99% (I can't remember which.) Cavalier is like sentinel only it works while sprinting. Only way to beat it is anti-armor weapons or VATS criticals which also bypass armor. 
---
What does he have? Anything rare? Or is he unaffiliated with another faction so has separate 200 caps available?
---
Must either be the new update or Bethesda giving it away for free because I haven't seen any additional marketing for it. Either way I'm happy. The more people playing the more time Bethesda will spend on it 
---
Also if you friend wants to buy the knight plan you know who to contact. 
---
Its like someone strapped a razor onto a sword then turned it into a helicopter 
---
https://m.facebook.com/groups/239749079913536?view=permalink&amp;id=393934417828334
---
Yeah. But he’s sort of determined to getting it legit.
---
Most of the ones I have been helping are brand new :) and the stuff I give away wouldn't be of use to a high level player. I male level 10 or 15 weapons with decent mods for people or Armour 
---
Been inside a few times it's really easy 
---
Everything you said is true. I just don’t think it is that high of a priority. Then again the characters I use the most are Sneak Sniper and Melee
---
BOS is the top tier combat armor mod. Iirc it provides better resistances than the regular best (polymer?). It also looks pretty cool, it's dark with the BOS logo. You can find a couple pieces of this in the cranberry bog in quest-related areas, but the plans are better because then you can apply it to legendary combat armor
---
Cavalier and sentinel are legendary effects that can cheese the game (mostly PvP). Cavalier gives you a flat -15% damage reduction per part when sprinting, sentinel gives a flat -15% damage reduction while standing still (jumping without moving in any other direction counts as standing still). That means it goes up to 75% with a full set of them, and 95% with lone wanderer. It's not a DR boost of 75, it is a flat 75% reduction of ALL incoming damage from any enemy type.
---
If any of the parts are also something like troubleshooter's or assassin's, that means you can go above 100% reduction against that enemy type with lone wanderer. These are third-tier effects, which means you can only get them on a 3-star legendary, making them extremely rare (along with being so desirable). Hence these are incredibly popular, and probably 90-95% of the ones you find circulating among players were duped because of how popular they were
---
Is there good loot in these? I thought it was mainly just to give you a place to go.  
---
What can I say man, Ark made me the evil bastard I am.
---
I did think honestly think about it. 
---
I admire that. I tried endlessly to get all the asylum uniforms just to do it. 
---
\*enclaving intensifies\*
---
Same, constantly disconnecting especially when trying to do fasnacht. My husband and I have had issues with guns not doing damage but melee weapons will and vice versa, weapons duplicating in inventory, and our characters are randomly unable to move. 
---
That’s a pretty average DR so looks you’ve got some decent armor and a good build. Perks like ironclad, barbarian and others will boost your DR aswell.
---
Cavalier- reduces damage while sprinting by 15%
---
Sentinel-reduces damage while standing still by 15%
---
BOS Combat armor is the best mod for DR/ER
---
These effects are sought after because with a full set you effectively reduce incoming damage by 75%. If you stack the Assasins prefix on top then that’s an additional 40% damage reduction. They don’t stack as you can never have 100% damage reduction but it effectively makes you receive ~5% of all incoming damage. 
---
If you don’t plan to PvP then cavalier and sentinel are still the best secondary effects for armor, but when it comes to PvP they’re almost a must if you want to compete with the top dogs.
---
I don’t know. Probably a game mechanic that is not meant to be. Maybe some Aid is stacking like the bobbleheads used to. Without exploiting some game mechanic I don’t see how it happens. 
---
Sentinel is sought after because it gives you a significant damage reduction perk so long as you are remaining still. Cavalier because you get a significant damage reduction when moving. BOS means Brotherhood of Steel combat armor, which has the best damage resistance in the game.
---
And my Commie Whacker
---
I want the floss I please
---
Yeah lol.
---
one time i had a massive 4v4v4v1 brawl between 3 teams and me, running about with a bounty as to not lose too many caps, and to get shot at. After being gifted 3k caps, I too learned fasnachts true meaning.
---
YES! This is only the second kitten I encountered in the game. The first was in the Ash Heap. I felt horrible that it was all alone in this horrible part of the map, so I spent the better part of an hour killing EVERYTHING that might pose a threat to the kitten.
---
I believe Fireproof alone will negate a mini nuke
---
I leave a lot of stuff either in the sutton train station suitcases or the white springs station suitcase
---
I know :(
---
Nice camp
---
That's another game I need to try.
---
That’s not how it works you might wanna edit your post and correct it. No one can just walk up and deal full damage to you, they have to claim the workshop first and then they and the owner of the workshop can do full damage. 
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Don't expect him to be there each time you go, he is a random spawn.
---
Ok another question. I tamed a cute dog with a bandana. Can I unequip the perk cards needed to get him now that he’s at my camp or will I lose him?
---
Smoking is bad my dude
---
I wonder if this is a recent addition!? I swear I've never seen this before.
---
How exciting! I'd make my vase the safest location ever forever and ever.
---
I got a plasma gatling recently
---
250 rounds per plasma core, been through a couple cores without it breaking
---
Cant help with the rest, but tis another heavy to consider
---
Disconnects and a very high amount of rubber banding. I can't walk 100ft without teleporting backwards. Almost unplayable.
---
I think it is Paladin Taggerdy's body.
---
TSE is 20% more damage and uses 2 projectiles. AA is just that Anti Armor. I am not sure about Furious. I believe it does more damage than a TSE if you are using an automatic weapon and your shots are good. 
---
Totally agree that would be so cool
---
And constipation +1
---
The most touching thing for me was at the beginning of the game. If you go to the top of the church steeple on Whitesprings, you can find the holo od Colonel when he was a kid. I won't go into detail, but if you haven't listened to it you need to. It makes me cry every time. Or if you're lazy and still want to listen add me on PS4 and I'll give you a copy.
---
You can connect the fusion core generator to the power plant so you don't have to use generators.
---
Wow! 😲 oooh my feet are tingling from the height! 😂
---
You've probably found this out by now but salt can cure meats so they don't spoil. 
---
i have assasians right arm,
---
just curious what plan/mod is powered sentinel, havent checked if i can craft it so just curious 
---
He can have clean versions of certain outfits and sells the hunters long coat among others. Also has the nuka cola clock and cuckoo clock plan.
---
I finally decided to pick up the game today. Hope my first Fallout adventure goes as good as this! 
---
hey, at least the random paper bag doesn't have legendary three star written on it and THEN not have something nice in it. 
---
?
---
Yeah I’m hoping someone will clarify if the different effects really matter for example (TSE is __% better cause of this reason)
---
The game needs a pop up for this, so players can be enlightened rather than stumbling through the mess of PvP. 
---
I've tamed scorchbeasts quite a few times.
---
Its legendary effects. 
---
You just like the game mechanic because it is so easily exploitable. A means of cap farming wasn't the stated reason for the change, stopping the noncontestable workshops was. Exploiters are using that fix to cause another problem that, yes, needs to be fixed. I'm all for PVP at the workshops. I'm not for cheesing the system for easy caps by making owners sitting ducks. 
---
See you space cowboy
---
You don't need to grind food. Canned dogfood and water rain from the sky in this game. It's literally just a matter of clicking those every hour or whatever, which I admit is annoying but it's not grindy.
---
I haven't touched a cooking station in like 100 levels for this reason the shit expires way too fast, and the bonuses are meh and not really needed
---
get a low level frients bo be bounty bait while having them be bankrupt, and hide with your one tap weapon of choice at the events end. EZ claps. EZ caps.
---
Lordy, already had assumptions about you, thanks for confirming them though, good luck with your ADHD when you can't wait a minute or two.
---
The problem is when you crest 100 and really start getting better equipment it starts crushing space. Perks should maybe apply to stash box. I have a medium assortment of heavy weapons, rifles and some melee. Different things for different jobs. Ultracite Plasma Cores and Fusion cores take up a lot of space as do their respective weapons. Thousands of rounds of ammo on me is ok, but stash it and holy crap. Keeping mats for repairs, bulked or not is ridiculous, but i need half it for crafting so i dont have to farm every single time i break a gun...
---
I'd take a stash bonus for atoms at this point...
---
The overseers holotapes make me tear up. Young Colonel too, when he blames himself for the war and everything because he was bad. And then he says he’s been really good so maybe now his dad can come back. 😭
---
There is a pop up when you interact with the workshop
---
Do you need both maxed?
---
Thank you 
---
Furious wins that fight. I don’t have the exact number for however. 
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you. I’ve “invested” over 550 hours and am currently level 203 and still feel like I’m new to the game. Still haven’t discovered about 1/3 of the map and just launched first nuke last week. 
---
I get addicted to one Game at a time and it becomes all consuming. Fallout 76 hit the mark for me and it’s the only game I play. Previously GTA and before that Fallout 4. 
---
I think he’s saying he has joined the brotherhood of steel. Lol 
---
Isnt Survival servers in like 1-2 days and than theres all this other stuff coming soon. Please stay, I promise things will get better!
---
Once survival gets released slap damage is supposedly getting removed from the normal mode 
---
I say let all 5 marchers die, then no one click E on the bonfire when he chants burn. Maybe shoot it with cryolaters. Disrespect the summer enough and maybe itll get you a winter mask?
---
As long as no one tries to stop me from nuking morgantown whilst cackling madly, I'm cool with this. 
---
Can’t we have both? 
---
I saw someone kn here that roleplay Preston. I think he even runs around talking about settlements needing help in area chat.
---
I heard it to but have it on video https://youtu.be/LrGs_DbaqCg
---
I have a rifle alt. I use pistols as a side, mostly for that sweet 20% move bonus but yah... rifles WAYYYYY better than pistols/autopistols/revolvers etc
---
Don't know the proper name, to be honest
---
Mmmm, Jenkem.
---
Is that just due to the nature of Furious stacking up and the high rounds per minute of these types of guns.
---
Okay, I misunderstood, and I'm real glad about it because it would have been even stranger if I hadn't, but I don't get your results either. Weird. Sorry for reading over the power part of armor before. 
---
I've only seen level 20 chainsaw. Ripper is plausible but underpowered
---
That’s up to BGS
---
I’d like to hire your services! I lost my T60 helmet, but I’d like to get a higher rank BOS paint job on Ol’ Reliable. You say you recommend Paladin? Dm me with your GT and I’ll send you a message when I get another helmet. What’s the price per paint job?
---
Nah this game is trash and so are all you 76 fanboys.
---
Yeah I saw that during beta. 
---
I'm pretty sure gatling gun still reigns supreme.
---
As far as affixes, TS increases recoil, increases spread, lowers accuracy and requires both projectiles to hit to get full damage. It only performs well when it's also explosive due to the second projectile explosion. It's generally outclassed by AA otherwise. For TS/AA the damage differences weren't huge last time I ran numbers, sometimes even negligable but TS has too many penalties and requires you to aim down the sight just to have comparable damage to an AA weapon.
---
Gunpowder is love, gunpowder is life. My days are spent hunting it, and lead and steel..
---
I’ve noticed it’s only prototype after crafting it. When I changed the paint I couldn’t choose prototype again after. 
---
Good to know about the melee, thanks. I hope it get fixed. The auto tesla is fun to clear tightly package enemies.
---
I set mine right on the river North of Flatwoods but South of the overseers camp, all are welcome plenty of amenities and I leave aid laying around for lower level players and it's a quick trip to the overseers camp to load her cache up with aid &amp; ammo &amp; such. XBoxOne BTW
---
Might be a good way to get excavator mod plans. 
---
Correct. 
---
At this point TSE is a glorified grenade launch. Good for clearing crowds and downing small stuff. That and the PTSD it brings you when you remember all the ghouls you didn’t get to hit. 
---
I haven't claimed one in awhile so thanks for telling me!
---
Two words: bloodied build. The most cancerous no skill build in the game 
---
It looks like it is 15% damage increase per burst and capped at 50% for Furious. AA is only good for high armor creatures. TSEs are pretty nerfed. As a general weapon I would choose Furious. AA would probably be better for high level super mutants and tougher. TSE would probably be better for everything below Super Mutants like scorched and Ghouls. Furious should be good enough on anything. It will have less benefit on weaker enemies than tougher enemies. Maybe not as good as AA on a SQ but good enough. 
---
The event Heart of the Swamp has to be running OR someone has to be doing the quest. Event is on, pods will bloom. No event, just pods.
---
 Reduced hunger, -10% AP regen, +5% thirst, 1 hour. 
---
Agreed. 
---
And I get it that you were drunk. Still. If I found a glitch that allowed me to steal someone's stash of legendary items, flux and ultracite, and took advantage of it, then I ought to be banned from the game. 
---
But is IS a funny story, and you deserve credit for being honest about how it played out. 
---
Glad you took the loss of all the scrap in stride. 
---
Just switch servers my dude
---
yeah, they added some new random encounters. i'm sure there are more that we haven't found yet. 
---
I hate the radtoads too because of that. I usually kill them from distance and often avoid looting them.
---
Go chainsaw!!
---
https://youtu.be/U2TD3Yz62XM
---
just animal friend, wasteland might be used for some of the other critters but you don't need them both. 
---
I’m not playing 76 st the moment. But even though if I DM you I will not give out my gamertag. I will probably do a group post on Xbox about it instead. Also I still need to get the elder paint. Also the prices I’m not sure about but I’m definitely sure that the price will increase the further the rank.
---
K
---
So an AA _ _ 3* would be the best option all purpose roll? 
---
Well we can agree to disagree. I think it is a bit lame to join consensual pvp and then use “sitting duck” as an excuse to change game mechanics. You make yourself a sitting duck. 
---
Have create it new and never paint it
---
The overseer told you to bring it with you as a portable base of operations
---
I moved around for a while til i found a spot i liked. I've crushed a few houses and rebuilt, but haven't moved in a month. Now that caps are way easier to attain I'm not so worried about traveling everywhere
---
This weekend has sucked worse than the BETA days.  Granted, I've been doing nothing but server hopping fasnacht, with what looks like at least 10-20 other regulars I keep seeing.  So maybe that's having an effect.
---
You can also just use a crafting station to level up most of them
---
TSE is probably best, especially with demo perks as well as the stabilized for armour reduction. If you get your hands on an AA it will be pretty good though.
---
Biv has a daily quest for recipes after doing the frat quest
---
No BOS doesn't.  Heavy metal does.
---
Have to disagree slightly.
---
Your correct on the secondary, but the Tertiary can be a stat or 90% reduced weight, in the 20'ish 3* gamma guns I've gotten. 
---
Here’s what I do/have
---
I build in a minimalistic sense. My base is only a 2x3 footprint. It’s even smaller on the inside. Because it’s so small i can freely move it without worry of it won’t fit or whatever. Only thing I have to worry about is the caps. 
---
Only buildings I have are the house a greenhouse and a small water farm. All you really need is that. 
---
I used to do the portable thing but I set up shop on a lead node recently and I love it. I don’t think I’m moving again. So many bullets. 
---
Beth games have done this for while. I'm in the middle of Oblivion (again) and now that I'm approaching level 24 I can get all the best quest rewards.
---
Too*
---
Personally most of my weight is sugar... I've been cutting back on foods and drinks with added sugar and I've lost 45lbs over the last 6 months
---
Don’t think we need anymore increases. Backpacks are coming and people are starting to hoard less. 
---
I have an Executioners Gatling Prime Plasma. Its a noticeable difference when things go under 50%. Cores arent bad to make and i get 2 or 3 queen fights before repair.
---
I like the one where he calls you a pansy ass pinko. It’s a close second to that holotape on Kora where she says, “Have fun rebuilding this infected mess of a world, ya dipshits.”
---
 They’ve already got an addicting system going. 
---
Smoking could take 5-10 seconds and give you a positive/ negative buff. 
---
AP Regen -50 
---
AP +50
---
Charisma -1
---
Perception +1?
---
Nice to know, thanks!
---
Acid and cloth, my friend.  Acid is a bit of a pain, but it can be farmed pretty well if you don't mind server hopping a bit.  The weight of the materials is quite a bit less than the gunpowder itself.
---
It was like this as first, but this weekend few people have been giving and more have been trying to sell instead.  I still just drop my extras, try to put them in front of n00bs if possible.
---
Would you mind sharing the location?
---
Does mr gutsy count?

#IM ON TOP OF THE WORD AY
---
Fucking Cazodors in FNV wreck my shop all the time when I'm low leveled and I'll equipped. I will take the largest detour imaginable if it means not getting stung 8 times.
---
I got elder to drop this evening vincent. keep at it
---
Considering how much damage they do yes
---
Depends how long it takes you to hop server. I mean, that’s the route I would take. 
---
1k would be nice for the heavy weapon users...
---
I remember that my thoughts always go to how depressing it is. Not because of how lonely it is. But because that bullet you just punched through that scorch's head used to be a mother or a father or a responder or someone who was once a human. No one remembers that the game has no NPCs because that fucking thing in the sky causing a ruckus turned them into monsters.   
---
And then you think to the future games. Your character made that happen. Without you cleansing the world of monsters and the plague and everything this shit could have gotten bad and you and a bunch of sociopaths made this happen in the wasteland.   
---
A bunch of people running around celebrating Fasnacht and launching nukes into a golf course shaped the world into the thing it is in the other games. And the best part of all the Fallout games? Everyone complains about the nukes but they did them a favor. 
---
I love Fallout as a whole. The lore is so funny and rich no matter which game you play. I hope more people keep coming around to this one because it's great and as far as I can see it's just getting started. Fasnacht was great (minus the rare masks thing) and all it is is a silly little public event where you make sausage and donuts and escort robots.
---
You can see what they all look like in the camp menu
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Survey Camp Alpha is where I just found 14\7 so that is the spot when you have to make it for the quest. 
---
How many heavy weapons do you really need?
---
This is probably a terribly dumb question but, did you by any chance have ownership of a workshop as this happened? Because that sounds pretty brutal if you were already flagged.
---
yeah use bear arms. 
---
Best I can do is $5
---
I run a conduit through the wall to a switch. 
---
It's all about rolling with the punches. Don't like VATS? I get it, you think it's a cheat and on other games it would be, but here everyone has it, so time to think of a way to defeat it. Try using terrain and distance to reduce your silhouette and hit %. Little things like a chainlink fence won't block bullets but it will break VATS. Maybe you don't have time for overly-creative footwork? Start using Stealthboys and/or Chameleon armor. You might try that autogrenade gun but don't expect grenades to outclass everybody. Explosives are easy to counter with a Dense mod and/or Fireproof. And while AA melee will punch through most armor, you won't dent a full set of Sentinel (especially if you can't force them into a stagger ...or you won't let Criticals do the dirty work for you). So, now what do you do? Get a Gamma Gun, for starters and maybe force them to give ground via Pumpkin Grenades. 
---
Plenty of options available in PvP, to be fair.
---
Only recently made game I've played that you can smoke in is My Summer Car.
---
Nope just my camp 
---
You would think if you guys wanted to PVP so much you might try actually taking a workshop every once in awhile, but no, no follow through. Too scary to actually hold them. Someone might sneak up on you. Gotta give up on contesting or server hop, might run into your twin. 
---
Quite possibly and likely I’d say. Mechanics just working as intended if that’s the case.
---
Wow it's worse than I thought. Poor little Gamma Gun, I wonder what the devs have against radiation damage that they'd put so many limits on it. 
---
At least the Gamma is still decent on it's own.
---
It's just a skin. They didn't redo anything. 
---
If you type in “map of resource deposits” on here you can see all of them!
---
That would be nice. Considering how many nuka colas and new alcohol it would be awesome to be able to display them all. 
---
It's because everyone is server hopping the Fasnacht festival.
---
Someone had posted before that if someone builds a base at Charleston the bot can still spawn.  It just moves location.  So just look around for the random spawn before you start breaking things.
---
Ah, the good ol' demolish crappy camps roll play. It should be a service.
---
It doesn’t look as bad...it’s just so...red 🙄
---
[Me and my friend got a similar pic.](https://i.imgur.com/cOQfimY.png) I love taking pictures at the theme parks.
---
I saw this for the first time a few hours ago, when i was server hopping for the witch dress. I bought the plans and some lemonade, because lemonade. It's pretty cute. I wonder how long he's gonna wait. 
---
That’s why you took the time to comment on a 76 thread right? You know all you hatewagoners seem to love to comment on this game when you supposedly hate it so much. 
---
Fallout '86
---
Sounds cool, can you tell me more?
---
0 berets on my 9 luck main since release. Beret on the first run with 12 luck alt.
---
Anecdotal 0 impact evidence, likely a fluke, but yeah.
---
I like the red one but yeah...the door. I don’t know why they did that. 
---
I have a tse prime minigun, prime executioners gatling plasma, prime executioners gatling laser, 4x sets power armor... why should i have to part with them? 
---
I wish they would make the kitchen stove usable for cooking. 
---
I was wondering if there's places to find or buy liquor recipes. Does anybody know if Biv is the only source of these?
---
There is the Bottle and Cappy shirt and jeans (or something like that?)
---
It’s casual and not at all badass but I rock it from time to time. With the beanie, it’s fun to be a post apocalyptic hipster sometimes.
---
Given they are working on moving the camp placement zone restrictions currently I imagine they are aware and working on a solution for this exact issue. 
---
It doesnt apply in the box though. I don't carry the stuff all the time, its for queen fights and hopefully vault raids if the ever get around to adding some actual content to the game.
---
This game also Really puts an emphasis on what is lost, more than any other Fallout game imo.
---
I would assume around 1k, unless it’s 2 or 3 stars
---
1* 2 shot?
---
I’ve gotten over 1000 acid in the past several days from the beeswax from the parade town. 
---
Probably Sugar grove or the enclave bunker in the military wing. 
---
Sit tight just a little longer. They are already on the way with the rescue.
---
Since when? 
---
99 percent of people starting the game probably got some average responder outfit during the first few quests. 1 percent got an ultra rare alternate firebreather outfit. Right at the start of the game. It's still highly sought out.
---
Sometimes novelty benefits from having to deal with dumb stupid rough luck.
---
It makes sense, but it would be quite annoying having to go to our camps a bunch just to rest
---
March 26th? 😅
---
It isn't a survival game. It is a rebuilding game where nothing gets rebuilt.
---
Well dang, I thought once you did that initial one you were done.  Do you just go see him every day or will it show the icon on the screen?
---
Quick cal WHAAmbulance
---
3 in Fireproof in Endurance makes you take negligible explosive damage. Could use padded instead of dense with the perk and still be essentially immune.
---
I run with the card and a dense chest. Card is definitely useful when I'm in PA and my armor isnt in effect.
---
Can we get Angry Rick's famous Fermented Brahmin Milk Martini? Pls?
---
Those
---
yes 
---
Yeah you just go see him daily
---
Mine is PS4 and Region 3, I saw old man summer few days ago but now I can't find it anymore in the atom shop, only the Moonshine Mama.... Is old man summer confirmed to last until end of the event?   
---
Also, been farming masks and all normal ones, and no recipe at all! After the event is over, I'm willing to trade my 2nd Beret to any recipe if I still can't get it till then.
---
Was it only me tried to take a photo while sitting on the pot? Somehow couldn't:(
---
Yep, he can spawn up on that bridge as you walk into Charleston. Turn around when you spawn in from fast traveling and go up to the bridge and cross over, and something will spawn in there. Sometimes it is him.
---
❤️
---
Been seeing complaints. Only had issues a couple of times with crashes or server stability since the dlc launched that I can remember.
---
Your probably getting paid to love it. I like the FO series despite its faults but they went too far with this one.
---
I installed a PTRS mod in Fallout 4. A soviet anti-tank gun firing an explosive round into the face tends to turn most things a tad bit dead.
---
 Sweetie I am a ghost in the night. I have repeatedly killed the Flatwoods Monster because I know what he sounds like, and I nearly effortlessly, sneak kill him every time. You have to overwhelm him or he's gone. I am pure ninja so much of the time. I use terrain constantly in combat and my herding of the Ghouls in Harper's Ferry into a place I can get them to horde my doorway is certainly a work of art. The Combat Knife kills em so fast that is the best way. ;) 
---
 I have a good chance to stagger anyone with my 12 Grenades even if they take little damage from explosions. I take none. I have very good armor with Chameleon bits. Killing Harper's Ferry is just so much fun. I am having a blast in fact.
---
Ima try and hit you up sometime. Bearich when you see the add!
---
Thanks, I'll definitely start doing that.
---
750-1k. Its really too bad its not furious or something too, then it'd be worth something.
---
But, as a used car salesmen would say, a sucker is born every minute, so get out there and sell it!
---
&gt;	now that I’m 69 
---
*nice*
---
The overseer is dead! Should of stayed static lol
---
I was thinking today about how normally you’d bury those bodies. You’d come out organized with a plan. You’ve been preparing for 25 years to rebuild society and you all trickle out and scatter to the wind? That’s probably why things are so bad 210 years later. This is all Vault-Tec’s fault.
---
Woulda been cooler if you just said, “I’ll bee bock.” in Arnie’s Terminator voice.
---
We've found no body that I know of... Just the trail went cold
---
The vendor will spawn at a different location around Charleston if a camp is there.  Look around a little before hopping or destroying things.
---
Part of the problem is that the pop-up is horribly worded. 'Other players may initiate PVP with you' makes it sound like you get a chance to decline or walk away. 'Initiate PVP' is not the same as 'one-shot' so it's understandable that people keep getting confused. It's never explained clearly in the game itself.
---
It seems like the Mothmen attack more when you take their Mothman Eggs. Perhaps the other cryptids have triggers beyond random event spawns?
---
Maybe make a point to loot the Alien Blaster every play through. Keep one in the inventory and scrap the rest. Maybe they respond to alien hullabaloo. 
---
ThatsWhyIAlwaysHave 17 CANS OF COFFEEEEEEE ON ME!!!!!!!
---
Been asking/wondering about completion with no ballon bursts but can’t find any info.  Would love some.
---
Actually varies by limb
---
My turrets killed one the other night and I’m upset about it too. I wish we could tame them. 
---
lol. Thanks for the info, and I hope your spakle work came out good.
---
My guess would be Nuclear Winter. *Assuming* that update actually has something to do with nukes, it would make sense for the Enclave to be involved. They're the most direct connection we've got to any sort of nuclear activity at the moment.
---
How much and what platform?
---
We just need the legendary vendor at this point, I’m sitting on like 500lbs of 2-3stars 
---
"I've swallowed the little book of calm!"
---
Also we need to be able to rename weapons and armor like in 4. Please. 
---
You rollback enterprise apps to known good state, for restoration and recovery. I doubt anyone wants to relive that  drama from the previous iterations.
---
More importantly if you can’t see the performance differences from then,  and  now you have deeper issues.
---
I love when he talks to moo-moo.
---
Yep, radtoads are nasty and I'm glad they're not more common elsewhere in Appalachia.
---
Oh boy. The Luck tree my friend. They're unreasonably good.
---
I’ve got the adrenal reaction recipe, idk what a reasonable price is tho but I’ll accept an offer
---
How do you run conduit through the wall?
---
There is a random encounter with a mister handy selling lemonade that will sell you the recipe for hard lemonade. I think that’s the only non Biv recipe 
---
I found a level 50 bloodied combat knife with +40% swing speed being sold in Watoga Station the other day.  One man's trash is another man's treasure, I guess
---
Thank you
---
But that only works for a couple of power armors, excluding excavator and X-01 and ultra cute
---
I have a bloodied Gatling Gun as my daily driver. 
---
Me with full health: base damage 151. 
---
Typical damage while playing 205 - 230.
---
With the right mods it's accurate, and does a great job of clearing out your standard enemies. Only enemies that give me trouble are the SBQ and the MQ. Everything just melts or is killed in 1 - 3 shots.
---
The best part about the Gat, is that you can run along and treat it as a semi-auto rifle for most of the time, unless you get in a jam and then you lean on the trigger to deal some solid DPS.
---
I am still working on my queen build, I've got an Anti-Armor Gat, a two-shot gat, and a furious LMG that I've converted to prime to test to see what I can come up with to deal with her best.
---
Before the nerf to the Two-Shot Gat, my prime Two shot would melt her, but now I'm still searching for something worth while. 
---
As far as durability goes, the new buff to heavy weapons allowed me to swap out a level 5 gun smith for a level 2, and the guns still last longer than they did previously. 
---
For a non-prime Gat: Speedy Receiver, Large Mag, Comfort grip, I personally like the long barrel as well, but if you deal with lots of enemies up close, stick to the short. 
---
Whitespings isn't what it used to be. It used to respawn every time someone new showed up but now that is not the case. Been there several times recently and nothing spawns even if I'm there alone and it's my first time in. This area definitely has changed. 
---
Monongha is the new place e to nuke if anyone cares. Charleston number two. Loads of glowing ones. 
---
Say whaaaat? Is that why I haven't seen any of those in forever? Never knew they capped below 45/50.
---
Check Watoga vendors when you're in the area, some folks make and vendor civil war suits from time to time.
---
Alright I'll have to launch some there tomorrow.
---
Commander! I have successfully cleared out all hostiles in the fortress the “BoS” call Camp Venture, they are taking over governmental property. I propose we launch a campaign against the treacherous Brotherhood of Steel
---
It's in no way an RNG filled grind if you don't make it one. Play it at your own pace. You'll enjoy it.
---
I think there will be risk. Othewrwise you would just stand at the vendor and spam the trade-up button to get the end-game out of your initial 3\* mutants rolling pin. I'm guessing you have to trade multiple lego's.
---
Forbidden
---
I’ve been in multiple parades where we all wore masks and no bot got injured, also multiple where 1-4 bots died and it didn’t make a difference. I think it’s pure RNG, it would be stupid if it wasn’t because it’s not like there are any notes or terminals to help figure out what the method would be.
---
You have to bug him though. I usually have to interact with him 2-3 times over the course of 30 seconds to get him to give me one.
---
Make sure to leave the Overlool spot to the north outside the zone. Good place to fast travel to start your run. 
---
Only Biv, other than Lemonade/Hard lemonade from the lemonade stand
---
They're 10 minute revenue drama-bait farming cancer. 
---
Datamining revealed it’s a 1/1000 chance for the rare masks only when all 5 bots survive!
---
On the bright side, I think you can tame them with an animal whisperer perk.  Not sure how it works, since I've never done it, but my good buddy has a Deathclaw named "Helen" living at her camp.  
---
Helen isn't really sure about me, but she tolerates my presence since [I build her a bed with things to play with](https://imgur.com/x9SuaIJ).
---
Yeah, I’ve had this happen. I’m glad really they’re fixing camp PVP in adventure mode at the survival mode release, because as-is this is just a really crappy setup. There’s absolutely nothing you can do to fight back, and the game punishes you with cap loss if you try to defend your base. It’s pretty scummy and not at all in the spirit of the game. 
---
For now, just server hop when you get the notification someone is trashing your base if you’re not doing anything that will be disrupted. If you’re in the middle of some important event or some other reason you don’t want to server hop, weigh if it’s better to let them destroy your base or to lose the progress of what you’re doing. I’d hold off on constructing more expensive things like the rad scrubbing arc until they fix this. 
---
Not sure if blocking whoever is trashing your camp would do anything. Anyone know? I’m pretty sure I blocked a dude griefing the fasnacht event the other night and it didn’t seem to do anything. 
---
Huh..
---
So you’re saying pve folks have to tolerate unwanted pvp? 
---
Lolz, your logic is exactly why survival mode was stood up.  People who don’t understand the consent.
---
Forcing folks to do pvp when they don’t want to isn’t just stupid, it shows lack of consideration of others, and a basic failure to understand of social norms..
---
That's the first step for the rare masks, way to screw up step 2. You were the first!
---
Lots of plans.
---
That would only work if the resulting trade item was no longer able to be traded in again. I'd be okay with that.
---
This is what I had to do. I also had to server hop after buying it from the white springs vendor because Biv wouldn't complete the quest. 
---
FYI- The Strangle bloom only blooms if someone has the quest that causes them to bloom is on the server or the Mire is in season. It's easiest to spot them at night.  
---
I server hopped 20+ times before giving up and just spending the caps at the White Springs. 
---
I will keep it in mind thanks.
---
You want my assassins rolling pin? Lol
---
I got this mask from some event, jester mask I think, red top with crazy white face or whatever. I thought it looked pretty stupid so I dropped it on the ground at my camp. Later a friend told me I made a huge mistake, he said I could have gotten 100 caps or even 200 caps! Boy did I screw that one up!
---
Better yet, let us set a price on items that will automatically be shown every time we enter a trade with someone new.
---
Has there been video of these masks yet? Still images are quite easy to fake. 
---
If you have weight reduction perks you should carry it with you at all times! (Except junk because you can lose it if you die)
---
Use the new found space in your stash to store stuff that doesn't have weight reduction.
---
It's not ideal, but I carry around 5 shotguns (only use 1) because they only weight 1lb on me but take up over 10lbs of stash.
---
While there is a reactor within the Glowing Sea, that is not the main reason for it being the nuclear hellscape we see it as. That’s the result of the nuke that goes off at the beginning of the game. The Crater of Atom is that bomb’s impact crater.
---
Doesn’t work with server hops, not 24 hours. It’s more like every hour or so 
---
Is that a Matilda reference.....
---
I sympathize with your grief. If anything it’s a credit to all the graphic artists who contributed into the rendering.
---
Can’t let it get you down.
---
Excavator, XO-1, and (soon) Ultracite all have Atom Shop paints.
---
It desperately needs to. Hopefully it will if we ever get private servers. 
---
I was that guy once. We found a glitched horde event in cranberry bog where they kept spawning. I had no fusion cores left, I tried to buy the low % core and noone would sell.
---
While I agree... not sure how that would help here.   In fact this might even conflict with trading as now you’d just see my “Old Sally” and have no idea what it is.  
---
I do like the idea of renaming but it would obviously have impacts unforeseen from FO4, now being a PVP environment. 
---
Was reading this at the home page and didn't realized it was about fo76. Read it as if it was about real life.
---
Sound like the most stupid complain about the nature of things
---
I have a dog helmet in stash if you want it. (PC)
---
Does the perk stack with the legendary effect?  I use a Suppressor's Ski Sword and it most definitely works at 20%.  Stacking it with the perk would be close to OP.
---
Maybe wait till Tuesday’s patch comes out and the pvp server goes live should create better stability. Also you weren’t that close you still had another 10-15 mins to launch a nuke. 
---
If only one or two survive y won't even get a mask. Only plan or recipe.
---
I said I don't hate this game I'm level 100 something I like it there's no reason for the down votes I just want help to make this game run better.
---
They're available through Responders vendors. I think I got mine in Flatwoods.
---
I have my camp next to it
---
It didn't take me that long though.
---
Really? I guess I haven’t noticed them
---
Gahh!! I'm so sick of waiting for the good content while they drop us brewing stations and festivals. I want backpacks and new zones and fucking vault raids. I'm so impatient!!
---
Death skull mask is the only skull mask, it represents the reaper, you'll know if you've seen it by it's back hood it has
---
I thought that was cool too. I'm surprised that it's not a drop for one of Biv's quests. 
---
Pretty sure you need the headlamp mod items to make the X01 headlamps.  Are you sure you don't just have some random X01 headlamp mods in your stash?  I have a normal and bright sitting in there just incase I want to switch them.
---
Didn't down-vote anyone here. 
---
I'm guessing it's probably easier for me to make a run around whitesprings and collect legendary stuff than it is for some others.  I don't have an awful lot of stuff to buy in-game, so maybe if I leave a bunch of armor and weapons that I don't want in a blue suitcase at a train station, someone else will get a small advantage and bit of confidence they need to start killing legendary enemies on their own.  Thus, everybody wins.  
---
Those players won't be so intimidated to enter a nuke zone with an instigating, furious or explosive weapon, and are then able to land better and better gear more efficiently and with more confidence.  Afterwards, they can leave behind their starter weapon for someone else, and the cycle continues.
---
I prefer to crap with the door open.
---
2 reasons. 
---
Fresh air.. because jesus christ in a handbasket those things wreak.
---
And no one will bang on the fuckin door as if itll make me crap faster.
---
Of course several jobsite and other supervisors have a talk with me.. but after stated reasons.. they just kinda give up.
---
Spot on!
---
I love the community feeling to it. 
---
We all march in the parade together, level 7s to 157s travelling from across the map to Helvetia for the same purpose. We all charge like mad dogs when the enemies attack, and do our best to protect the bots and keep the parade going. Once it's over, you see level 10s give a quick thumbs up, and level 200s jump up and down excitedly with their marsupial perk, level 35s dropping duplicate masks for anyone to grab up, and level 79s selling off their excess plans and loot to any who will pay. You see raiders and responders and BoS people saluting and giving a thumbs up, rocking out with a guitar, standing there proudly with hands on hips, taking selfies and celebrating another successful parade. You see a mixture of armours, all colours and types, sharing one common theme: Fasnacht masks and hats. People up and move their whole C.A.M.P. just to allow everyone a safe space to sort their inventories out after the parade. It really brings out the best in people.
---
I have never played a game that has made me feel that sense of community, and just good ol' fashion wholesome fun the way this does. 
---
I can't wait to see what other seasonal events Bethesda throws our way in future, but I'll honestly be sad to see Fasnacht go. 
---
All of the power armor paint bundles include an XO-1 paint, Excavator just recently got its first paint, and Ultracite has a datamined paint from the same batch as the Excavator paint.
---
Congratulations on your progress. We're just looking to gain insight and perhaps build a leaderboard.
---
Most people have said you rename it, however when trading it shows up as the normal name and if it gets traded the custom names disappear. 
---
That’s a good idea, I usually run around at low health so my luck is pretty high 25ish maybe? But nothing good from the quest 
---
If you’re on Xbox I could give you a suit of excavator.
---
-10 hp + 40 AP 
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but people will still be able to slap you to death in adventure mode.
---
Bethesda stated there is no change to how PvP will work in adventure mode when survival mode is introduced
---
I hear ya. I had some idiot slapping me earlier today, trying to goad me into a fight. No thank you, I'm here to level, free Appalachia from the scorched menace, and open a store once player vending becomes a thing.
---
Hello . Feels bad when that happens. On the bright side,  I can craft you a new set if you like. For a few of course. Offer?
---
HAHA, dang if I could upvote this 1000x.  Without anything and just looking at the pic, that was my EXACT thought.  I came in to post it, and dang if that isn't the first post in the thread.  Bravo sir.  :D
---
I think very few people know all the paints. I think to get an answer you will have to test this for yourself. If you're getting your technical data from where I think you are 😉 you shouldn't have trouble testing this and giving us an answer.
---
Biv restarts at 8pm daily so if you miss a day, go back to him before 8pm and you can get two in one day.
---
He's probably doing the Excavator Power Armor bug.
---
If you log out while inside the Power Armor, the next time you log in the +100 bonus for the full Excavator set is Doubled.  +200.
---
This is temporary.  As soon as you step out of the Power Armor and back in, you lose that extra +100, and it goes back to just a normal +100.  Until you log out and back in while still inside of the Excavator suit.
---
That TF2 gig sounds nasty.
---
However bethesda has mentioned to the community, in this thread that they're "looking into fixing the drop rates".
---
They've done the best they can to admit a mistake without actually admitting it. (As they really can not afford to take more blows to their rep thanks to the shark pool on youtube).
---
The chiefs take a little time to walk out and spawn and if one dies it takes longer to complete the nuke launch prep
---
Levels are indicative of nothing. My low level could destroy my level 320 in a PvP fight. I think you need a different metric of success
---
Just added you!
---
My thread does not state anywhere that success is tied to leveling. You said that.
---
I'm trying to spot the highest levels out of interest.
---
Got a be agility handmade, looking for a comparable lever
---
The only ones worth a shit at lvl 50 is the smg from the water park and all rise. 
---
The mistress of mystery stuff will carry you to 50 pretty reliably imo.
---
The rest are trash.  Am lvl 55 and yeah my 2nd run through i knew what to look and save quests.
---
Besides cap can get you way better than trash 1 stars. Hell even ammo and scrap trading.
---
Sounds good.  Then naming it “NFS” or “Not for sale”, really wouldn’t help this situation, unless I’m misunderstanding you.  
---
Whitesprings and Harpers ferry almost only
---
It stopped bleeding
---
I’m on ps4 but thanks!
---
Don't drop power armors to get into them.  Dropping them removes them from your character and in the case of crashes or disconnects you will lose them instead of having them return to your person.
---
thanks, but sadly he's like any other tamable critter and you can't actually interact with them. here's hoping a future update will give them a bit more utility. 
---
If you need 1k stash you actually just need a vendor
---
I am on ps4, I don’t know which console you are on though. I barely have any screws if that’s what you are asking, I think I might have 5. If not I don’t have much to trade other than 500 caps
---
Corn soup for me
---
I realized I needed to pull the cores out but by the time I figured that out the game closed.
---
It’s comical when people try to defend the PVP in this game, it is hot trash and no skill required whatsoever, in fact this is the first game I have no desire to participate in the “PVP”. They are exploiting a poorly designed workshop interaction to one shot people who can’t fight back, literally the game doesn’t allow them to do damage to the other person. Now whether this is how it’s actually designed, which I have read multiple places that it is, or it’s just because they were able to get a full set of sentinel at or because of duping, it is just dumb. It is the definition of griefing and bullying, it’s not skill based at all when a player can be invincible and one shot another player. I hope that the majority of these “hardcore” pvp’ers leave when survival mode comes, go enjoy yourselves.
---
Can you use the med kit box outside the flatwoods church? 
---
I would imagine most of us always check med boxes
---
You've walked the 7,000 steps of High Hrothgar....only to find a grey beards holotape. 
---
Highest level I’ve ever seen on ps4 was 400. Never have I seen above 500 and I have 600 hours doc’d
---
never drop them, always deploy them. deployed power armor is still yours. and should return to your inventory on disconnect
---
Think it's pretty clear by now they glitched the rare masks out of the game and don't want to admit it. With their track record lately this is the only explanation really.
---
This is so cool - I was just wondering yesterday what the difference was thanks
---
Basically for example what I did in 4 was:
---
Two shot hardened handmade, renamed to simply AK-47
---
I just liked having the guns and armor renamed for me. Armor would just be combat left arm, etc. 
---
I am on PSN.  I'm sorry I can't craft a new set for that amount. I would ask for 2k cap using my materials. But I would like to help u. Get the materials u need, and I'll craft it for u max durability free of charge. 
---
Theres a holotape in the shed that talks about the bots but I dont know if it's new or not. 
---
Okay, I saw the red bandana and thought you put that on him.
---
My plan too.
---
Yea I can tell, didn’t know this before so I understand it was my fault, but when you run 50 hours glitch and disconnect free I didn’t expect this to be the one.
---
I would prefer the plan over the item haha
---
Yea, I understand it was my fault but running 50 hours glitch and disconnect free I didn’t expect this to happen.
---
Ok, I’ll let you know then! Thank you
---
Ok, great.  I agree that would be nice.  But what does that have to do with marking items not for sale or declining requests in trading?
---
You want to delete this post asap
---
We can hypothesise all we want... without a big enough sample showing a single hypothesis works, we're all just speculating. It's annoying, for all of us... we just have to accept that it's as lucky as winning the lottery...and leave it at that.
---
Seems to be the case with many things in this game... there's RNG, and then there's just stupid...  having one person hand in &lt; 50 technical data and get all the paints, vs other people that have handed in hundreds and never gotten past Knight... it's a stupid process for an online game to fall back to the RNG to 'solve' everything..
---
Events and Quest items should have limits as to how many times you can fail before it MUST reward you with something...
---
Ya... nothing will change.
---
Griefers and trolls will still exist in Adventure mode.  These types of people aren't going to switch to the Survival mode servers, cause people over there are going to be prepared and looking for a fight.  No easy pickings to be had.
---
nope, he was born with it apparently :)
---
if you survive more then 10 hours always expect a disconnect is coming. sort of like how you should save a project every 5 mins
---
Doubling caps legit
---
Yeah I love the Gatling gun I have but I just want something a bit fast shooting.
---
I'm the king of typos... 
---
the spackling overall came out like most does, slightly lumpy until sanded ;)
---
If that's the case, you would've gotten **A LOT** more than that for it.
---
If you shoot while standing still does the sentinel still give you the effect?
---
Opening a store without the fear of someone destroying my camp is something I can’t wait for.
---
Hope to see you out there!
---
It might be cool if you had this door and anyone that came to visit had to deposit a cap to open it. That way you could know if someone stopped by as well :). 
---
That's awesome! Thank you for the help man! I will add it and credit you
---
Don't get excited for more quests like the Mistress of Mystery, there aren't really any. 
---
It wasn't, I just hope my personal feelings can help generate a conversation, as I feel the game as a whole doesn't get discussed enough, it's mostly specific aspects that get discussed. 
---
Whos Matilda? And is she interested in the bumper to bumper warranty?
---
I wish I had a lever action to trade you, pal. I’ve got a couple of explosive weapons, one is a 3* berserker’s gatling gun, it has plus one agility. Or a one star bloodied hunting rifle. Those are the only things, perk-wise, that are similar to the handmade. 
---
Trypophoboa? You mean being a bitch?
---
Bummer man
---
If you're on PC I can help. In game name is yaosio.
---
I have a bloodied combat rifle.
---
[not quite a selfie with the queen but this big guy looked way too proud of me to not post it](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vlI0H2TRLJf644JZ5pqmV4vCHUA7OQXw) 
---
Yeah I've noticed it's slightly worse.
---
They're definitely the rarest Cryptid I've run into, even including the Mothman. Good luck on your hunt, and bear in mind they can be a real pain if there are other enemies around.
---
Ugh.... I'm gonna have to really have a look at my build. Such a waste spending special points on something that should fit in a box.
---
It seems like you didn't read my full post, survival doesn't interest me, and I said I'm done until April 9th, thats when the other stuff drops.
---
Xbox, make a reasonable offer.
---
I came in not playing any Fallout and really liked the game and had no idea what folks were complaining about. I was \*in\* it emotionally. SO much despair. How you follow along the overseer's journey and watch her go from Optimistic to broken (i haven't finished it yet, but I just finished the Mining town where she was looking for Evan). Let alone the detail of each small town and each building, each with its carefully crafted environmental story. Like the Mothman alter in that first church you come across to an alter to another creature in the cemetery church in the west. And the lore items respawn (?) so if I ever forget I can get a refreshed with what happened. It's great and I'm looking forward to what's to come. (found vault 63!)
---
Only those from Mistress of Mystery questline.
---
Just Mistress of Mystery ones
---
Should I start selling my bulk stuff cheap ? 
---
hopped back on to see what things have changed, got disconnected by server. tried again, happened again.
---
looks like nothing has changed since i last played, lol.
---
My camp is near Charleston but I moved it a month or so ago when I learned that it could screw with the Responder Bot. I'm further down the road now.
---
If they were constantly finding me and killing me I would log out and back in to get on a different server.
---
The SMG legendary is not good. Fire damage doesn’t stack, and it’s actual damage amount is minimal at high levels. It’s hardly any better than a generic 10mm smg
---
Thank you, been hunting all day and nada. Can't give up hope though haha
---
No. Slap damage is being made zero in Adventure mode. Read the latest Inside the Vault. 
---
I have a wide variety of X-01 mods that I have purchased from the vendor over time.  I got 2 shocks this way - have sold 1.  Collecting 1 or 2 of most items.  Only every got the jetpack once - probably from a drop.
---
Yeah in that case your best bet would’ve been to hop server right away when said player started banging on your base. Tagging him back with your hammer opened you up and it was a wrap after that.
---
Everything sounds legit. 
---
With the popularity of unyielding bloodied builds, there are a bunch of people running with +15 Charisma doing the event for the last six days.  What ever difference it is or isn't making probably doesn't matter as the drop rate is near zero.  (Imagine if it was even tripling the drop rate, if it was something like 0.01%, then that's still only 0.03%).
---
Personally, I think Bethesda just didn't want to admit that they fucked up, and are too slow with minor fixes to make it better in the 7 day limited time frame.
---
I guess I'll sit on these 15 copies or so of each of the 5 masks that do drop.  And so many recipes and plans.  Not that these will have any trade value, as the massive amounts of grinding to attempt to get the rare/uncommon have made them abundant and worthless.  And Beth still doesn't have an Item for Item trading system to make their recommended "mask exchange" work even if the rare ones existed.
---
I agree that the spirit of the event is a communal thing.  I like throwing a molotov at the bonfire, even though I'm aware that you just need to click it.  I don't know why some expert always has to "advise" us on "proper technique" afterwards.  
---
My in-game friend is a nut about cosmetic items and camp stuff, so I can sympathize with her frustrations regarding the masks she wants, but I'm not personally bothered.  The owl and witch masks are my favorite, so I'm all good.  Toothy Man bums me out because it looks like a dirty grampa.
---
The sloth is sometimes unlootable on PC, also.  I think it happens when someone shoots or hits it before it has a chance for the health bar to start regenerating.  I have a sniper character, and I typically remain standing and try to get an arm or leg hit to do some damage but not a lot, then start shooting at the wolves and bugs coming up main street.
---
Also, it's kind to others and the event to run ahead and blow up the two jeeps near the end, just so lowbies and robots don't die in a car explosion.  I've seen characters as low as level 5 participating, so a splode will certainly ruin their day.
---
Today someone on the server (stayed on the same server with my friends all evening) was using a beast of a gatling laser and kept turning the sloth into an ash pile, which made it completely unlootable, even with a fast travel back into Helvetia.  Kind of a bummer for lower level players.
---
So I did the queen of the hunt and got a snallygaster...is it a random cryptid each time? The quest only let me hunt that one and then turn the sample in, quest over.
---
True. Only way to get better is to make some mistakes
---
Hmm okay thank you for the info &amp; sorry I couldn’t be of assistance.
---
And while we’re at it, can we mark junk that we don’t want to be bulk scrapped? I’m tired of wasting my plastic :( 
---
the problem is there are rares and uncommons, and the uncommons aren't showing up with any more frequency than the rares
---
Unless someone turned it into goo or an ash pile with an energy weapon.  Nothing fixes that.
---
I just wanted to say I was participating in that event and it’s ridiculous how many high level people it takes to even bring a queens health down by a smidge.  I was really excited too because that was my first scorched queen fight and it ended in disappointment...
---
Are there details on how it works? Can you place them anywhere or just at your base? Is there an item limit, a weight limit??
---
I stand corrected good sir or ma-am.
---
Not at all, but come on, you need nearly 1k of bulked stuff? Naah, no one does. Stop junking for awhile.
---
I'll agree it's nice to sit on it but junk is so easy to get... and that's why you have so much, see?
---
Hm.. You are right.. maybe they will add that one?
---
Preach it! If I find something like that I’ll hit you up. 
---
just bought it cant even play it becasue of the constant "server not responding controls temp disabled" (pc)
---
I thought it was just me. Eating &amp; drinking too fast (or random eating / drinking) can make me disconnected.
---
BTW that's the rate of the Uncommons ;)
---
Scorchbeasts, at least count for Zealots. I’d guess the Scorch-killer mods work too, but they’re really crappy compared to Prime receivers.
---
I have gotten very lucky in the last two days.  Had a good group of players on the PS4.  Using Cryolator and power attack bashes to the head to keep her on the ground and staggered.
---
This morning she actually died in about 5 minutes.  Last night it was closer to 10, she flew around a lot before finally landing and letting us get her.
---
A few days before that, we actually killed her with about 5 seconds left on the timer.  Luckily for us she decided to stay grounded without use of the Staggering or Cryolator for the last 4 minutes.
---
The Gat was awesome when you could use the Martial Artist perk to increase the fire rate. For general PVE though, you really can't beat it. The damage is high enough that it bypasses enough armor. 
---
When I took my Furious LMG out, it maxes out around 140ish. That ammo (except for the Ultracite ammo, weirdly) is way to expensive to make it a daily driver. Mini-gun eats through too much ammo as well, and the long spin up speed makes it non-viable for surgical strikes. 
---
I'm still researching to what my perfect heavy gun is, but I've played with Explosive LMGs, Furious LMGs, Two Shot LMGs, and the Furious has been the best so far... (though if I had a bloodied one I'm sure I'd love that as well.) I have 2 Two shot Gats as well, that's why I converted one to a prime.
---
I also have a Vampire Mini-Gun, which at first I thought was great. I'll basically be immortal. But it takes so stupid long to kill things. 
---
Gatling and .50 are still the only real viable heavy builds on the ballistic side. Both from an economical stand point and from a DPS perspective. (But again I'm still evaluating the LMG Prime, haven't gotten to take it to a nuke zone yet.)
---
Ledge perks I look for:
---
Primary-
---
Anti-Armor
---
Bloody
---
Furious
---
two-shot is last imho.
---
Secondary-
---
25% fire rate
---
10% damage when aiming
---
Explosive.
---
Third-
---
Weight reduction.
---
Slap damage is being removed but you can still initiate a duel by shooting each other.
---

---
&gt;ADVENTURE MODE “SLAP DAMAGE” ADJUSTMENTS  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Once the Survival Beta is live, we’re making a change to reduce all damage that would be dealt to you by players you are not currently hostile with to zero. This adjustment effectively eliminates “slap damage” and should greatly reduce the likelihood that you’ll fall victim to any unwanted PVP. 
---
Non-griefing wholesome breaking and entering. 
---
Yup
---
Sounds like you are Mr Sandman lol
---
Frankly, just expanding the “response” platform they already have, to the sellers would work great.  Potential buyers can request all they want.  Then I respond, declined: not for sale.  
---
I'd rather them be easier to force to land with shots to the wings.  I can VATS target their wings with my AA+VATS Crit Handmade over and over, and they still don't land until they feel like it.
---
Would be nicer if shooting their wings out actually made them crash land and be momentarily staggered.
---
You want them even easier to kill?! 😳
---
I think some things should be special to that area. I'm all for secret doors, but the Nuka Machine Door seems like it should be exclusive to the speakeasy. 
---
I'm a high level on PC. My name's yaosio. I can make a new character so we can be low level together if you want. :)
---
Please do dude
---
THIS.
---
I thought that we can get those rewards again by helping someone (team mates) who is doing that quest. And the reward will scale to your level. Idk where I read that somewhere, either here on reddit or the official Bethesda FO76 forum.
---
I heard that maxing it out gives 100 power at the power box near the workshop, as well as power boxes at all power substations for that plant. Haven’t messed with it to find out for sure though.
---
That’s Blackbird paint, and it was a very brief atom shop item. Can’t share atom shop items I’m afraid.
---
 With super mutant neighbors,  don't forget.  😂
---
My testing months ago concluded that the damage ramps up to a 60% increase after 12 consecutive shots. (i didn’t test missing shots and damage still ramping or only on consecutive shots, just had my participant stand still) My testing with a 1* furious non auto assult rifle was every 2-3 shots your damage would ramp by 10% until you hit 60. These tests were conducted months ago and I am still interested in furious damage scaling. 
---
They are easy to kill when they land, and you have a good weapon.
---
But game balance of level 50 enemies can't be balanced around the level 100+ with good builds and decent weapon drops.
---
Even then when they just fly around non stop its like "ok... why waste the bullets trying to shoot you enough to make you land... I'll just walk around and kill these scorched until you decide to land on your own.  Or fly away, I don't care."
---
Alcohol beverages for me. I always keep 2-3 for each alcohol just for BIV dailies. But as soon as I've got all the recipes I'm gulping em all down.
---
I enjoy going to random party members camps and placing either the annoying little tone boxes hidden throughout their camps, or I have the word "Penis!!" blue printed and just tag every thing with it.
---
My friends and I just build a circle arena using those giant concrete defence walls then build some stairs on the outside to get in. Sometimes we also get into full teams and just fight a team death match scenario in Watoga lol. Another idea is to use that small coliseum that's out in Pleasant Valley Cabins for pvp fist fights.
---
If you didn't know, all 3 power plants (Poseidon, Monogah, Thunder Mountain) all produce fusion cores if you take the workshop. There's also a perk that makes fusiom cores last 2x longer, which helped me out a ton
---
Eventually maybe. They increased the CAMP budget by reducing light and turret cost and putting a max limit on them, so they can always increase the stash some more.
---
I know probably as much as when you do, I think they said when you hit lvl 50 your lvl resets, you get buffs and you get a star, and you can keep repeating it and get more stars
---
Did you remove Power User?  Using a lot of Jet Packing?
---
The only real change I've seen is that all the Power Armor chassis that spawn in the wild now only carry 25% charge cores.
---
My cores still seem to be lasting the same duration.
---
nothing, we just try to bring it up unnecessarily as often as possible around here. Dupers are the sub's boogeymen
---
Killing the Scorch makes them land... sooo yeah. 
---
Waste bullets to make them land? They're like 40 shots to kill 😆
---
My favorite thing to do is hide in peoples' C.A.M.P.s while they're afk, the watch then run around thinking they're alone. When they find me, I drop some food and water before fast traveling out.
---
The overseer also said everybody would be alive when we got out of the vault.
---
You were not one shot with slap damage. It has been thoroughly tested. You can only deal 5 damage per second. Not per hit. Per second. You were either wanted and did not realize it or owned a workshop. A lot of gangs will leave one person to contest the workshop while the others hunt you down. You need to be able to damage people slightly outside of the workshop zone, but not globally. 
---
Remember, pacifist mode removes the damage you deal to others, not the damage they deal to you. Keep pacifist on and avoid taking workshops and you will be fine.
---
Yes, this!!!
---
I have never run out in 70 levels of using PA... Power User 1 alone makes a world of difference - even with Jetpack.
---
By the time one runs out, I've gotten at least one to replace it a - and I live in my PA.  Currently sitting at 20 or 21 cores at 94%+ (maybe 10 are 100%).
---
I keep mine static right next to the Overseer CAMP. This lets newbies find all the crafting stations, and they can take some crops if they want. If I need to travel I just fast travel, it's cheaper than moving my CAMP.
---
I’ve seen him near the Overseer’s camp at Flatwoods and New Gad. 
---
I've got tons of lead, gunpowder is the limiting factor for me. :(
---
I can't confirm it but I do know the power plants produce more energy for workshops.
---
100% agreed. I don’t know why people think the survival mode will make builds change or tactics better or even fix pvp more. 
---
Survival mode= hyperbolic time chamber. Go in, come out, kill. 
---
Don't have any full pictures of my camp but I do have a picture of the bar I made inside after the nukashine patch (which I think isn't half bad lol) 👍 https://m.imgur.com/gallery/5G4WWRv
---
Blame the way consoles store the photos. On PC they are stored in a folder that is easily accessible.
---
&gt;Hurr durr durr, check out my E-peen.
---
Game balance of level 50 enemies can't be balanced around the level 100+ who finally found a good legendary weapon to fit their build instead of just regular crafted level 40-50 weapons.
---
There should be a reliable way to bring a scorchbeast down to your level.  Having to focus on their wings should be a repeatable way to do so for people without the Epeen-Weapon-of-Choice that only requires 40 bullets to kill one.
---
Not on mobile with the app it doesn't.
---
I just wanted to encourage OP to participate if they enjoy ur and not worry about it views/upvotes.
---
I've basically done zero trading on this game. Is 500 caps too low? 
---
Thanks for the video, I went to the hunter's ridge one and found him on the first try.
---
Holy Todd, that's a really great idea. A raid mode would be so cool.
---
If no armor stands, then I would want dedicated PA space in our camp budget so we can display our armor without it automatically going back in our inventory.
---
I have to say i had a tse handmade for lvl 25. Helped a lot
---
why
---
Us older guys are generally friendly and generous.  Virtual items don't really hold a tremendous amount of value to me, so I'm happy to give away what I can't use.  I mean, I'll likely hold on to a 3 star item with nice properties, but if you're low on radaway, for example, I'm happy to give away 20 and keep 10 for emergencies.  
---
I also don't hoard.  There's no point to it, really.  I'll never use more than 100 screws in one sitting at this point in my game, so I just dump extra into train station suitcases along with other scrap, ammo, food, etc.  The only thing I can never seem to keep "topped off" is .45 and 5.56 ammo.  If you run low, you can always gather more.  Unlike real life, there's an infinite supply of everything in 76.  Some stuff just takes slightly more work to gather.
---
Yesterday's challenge was to kill 20 enemies in the bog while fueled up on cranberry moonshine.  A few server hops to reset Tannin's (bar-bot in the Whitesprings Hotel) menu and I got three jars, which was more than enough for the challenge.  (Also, I kinda wish that server hopping and spawning at the hotel would put you inside rather than in the front garden.  If I didn't put on my power armor as an afterthought I would have been dead before fully loading into the middle of an active blast)
---
Yeah, I get that but I'm always trying to find screws I xant get enough of them 
---
Yeah, my quad lever action is so bad ass lol... we are clearly playing two different 76s
---
Omg I know. I WANT THAT!
---
Mods said that the title wasn't descriptive enough. Here it is in it's entirety.
---
So here I am on my level 33 shotgunner running towards Silo Alpha so I can get it on my map when I happen upon a level 46 Yao Guai camping in the same area. I head up to the cliff edge overlooking the silo entrance and pond, and I decide to poke the bear with my .308 sniper rifle. I get it to about 70% hp as it begins charging towards me. It stops and realizes that a direct route won't work. Pathing kicks in and it begins to circle around to climb up to where I am. I figure I can get a couple good shotgun hits on it and drop down to force it to run all the way around again. Both shotgun shells land squarely on it's face and I back up off the cliff. Imagine my amazement as the now really pissed off bear jumps off the cliff with me! I scream like a little girl, turn as I land and begin sprinting away. I reach the other side of the pond, turn, and put my best Revenant face on because I am sure this thing is going to turn me into a dumpling. What do I behold? Nothing. No bear. No grunting. I switch to my rifle and zoom across the pond to find the bear dead where it landed. My shotgun shots had gotten it to about 50% hp before it jumped and I guess the fall killed it. I am one lucky SOB today. I hope all your interactions are just as hilarious today. See you out in the Wasteland!
---
I'm just telling you directly that levels mean nothing. Might as well have a leaderboard of the tallest people with the name Greg. I guess one of those Greg's is going to be the tallest, but that information is nothing than a statement of fact. I'm just trying to pre-emptively [deny any association of character level to strength, skill, or whatever](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b4vnst/bethesda_bethesda_on_the_wall_who_is_the_highest/ej9m0eh/) since plenty of people do that. 
---
Thanks for not blindly hating on the game😤🙌
---
If you're on PS4, I have a level 35 Vampire's I'd gift you. 
---
Survival mode seems to be where they would put a FROST equivalent. I really can't imagine what Nuclear Winter will be as anything I can think of could easily fit in the new survival mode.
---
Mods said the title wasn't descriptive enough.
---
nightstalkers are the only fallout creature that freaks me out.... i think it's because of the sound they make :|
---
As an ex smoker every time I see a carton it gives me anxiety. I'm that minority where in other Fallout games I edited the files to replace them with something else. CAN'T DO THAT NOW GIVEN IT'S ONLINE ONLY 😂 Help!?! Lol
---
Screws cannot account for extra 200 in the stash tho... how many screws is that even?!
---
I'd love for it to. My wife and I play on pc but my f.i.l., m.i.l., b.i.l., and her cousin play on ps4. We're casual players but we're still much further along than them. I'd be cool to have half a server be our family. ;)
---
Yep and noone here is talking about any of those things.
---
You are in a conversation about highest levels sighted in game!
---
I am done replying to you, you clearly came here to argue, your first post actually shows that.
---
You play ark don't you

I just want Lewis's room. His wallpaper, the cardboard standee, the freaking awesome lamp. I'd pay atoms for that freaking lamp.

I recall seeing a email in the RobCo facility about somebody being fired over a robot. It's been a while since I saw it so I might be misremembering what happened.

I mean about the legendary system and resets? It sounded like a hint at something like the prestige system in COD. Perhaps I have you mistaken.

No I'm talking about the excess stuff from finding screws 
---
The excess scrap 
---
I like the way they do this. In any other game they would spell it out for you, but in Fallout 76 you'll find hints laying around. If you don't find them you'll always be left wondering how it happened if you know the lore behind Quantum.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is a good game. For PVE exploration and emergent gameplay its grand. And for environmental storytelling it's a Master Class.
---
I completely disagree.  Fallout 76 is what I would call a *mediocre* game.  It isn't terrible or awful, but it isn't *good* either.  The PvE content of the game (story, enemies, atmosphere, etc.,) is well below average compared to many other games out there.
---
I got the game expecting a decent wasteland PvP experience.  Nothing extravagant like a Battle Royale, but something where I would doubt any *human* encounter I come across.  Bethesda made a total misfire of the PvP, however, by softening it up (aka *"baby-proofing"*).  Horrible ideas like slap damage, players visible on the map, fast travel, etc., all these things end up making the PvP a complete waste.
---
And since the PvE is lackluster (no "human" NPCs, only robots and audio logs), the game itself is just not interesting enough to play.  I have other games that tell a better story with better immersion.
---
Cool dude alert 
---
dunno, try restarting your computer?
---
I mean, the mini nukes were a mistake... most serious PVPers run Fireproof perk and Dense torso mods, which together make you immune to explosives all by themselves 
---
I've tried everything, resetting my .ini restarts and everything, might have to re-download... and that'll take a day or two unless theres another way
---
We're in a simulation, we don't need to.
---
But you are mostly after screws so throw the other stuff away or sell it... it's not good stuff anyways, right...? steel? copper?
---
Wont the same issue happen at 1k? You'll just have more excess junk from screws? 
---
You need "Stash Discipline" 😋
---
According to the post about Survival mode the CAMP change isn't coming next week, just slap damage removal, but the CAMP PvP change is coming. Now we just have to get them to stop spawning in enemies every time we fast travel to our CAMP.
---
LOL!
---
After having done the event so many times... (if we had intestines handy), I'd actually enjoy the challenge/change.  Sure, it'd have been annoying on day 1 or 2, but now, I think it'd make for an interesting change.
---
But maybe i want my own speakeasy?
---
It's a video game. 
---
Check the into the vault sections for all the fixes and they are starting to add small but new content. There’s a roadmap and everything. 
---
Don't take my disinterest with your bird-watching as hostility. I'm not trying to be argumentative. I think you just need to stop reading between the lines when I'm being pretty straight forward here. I have a high-level character and I think people shouldn't get obsessive about levels. You want proof of something I did that really isn't worth seeing IMO, hence I don't feel the need to prove it. I'm having some pretty productive exchanges with a few comment threads here. 
---
brilliant
---
As far as this community knows, no, there hasn’t been any definitive proof they are even dropping. 
---
With the plan you can make that back in about 6 days.
---
You right lol well I need to sell some bulk stuff I have then I have so much 
---
Bethesda want us back for good.
---
https://youtu.be/N2ICtCO8TCw
---
No, I'll still blame the player.
---
Is there an easy way to find these things?
---
I hope an Automatron-like DLC will be coming on this Fall since there is a picture indicating a robot companion on the roadmap Bethesda released.
---
then I would take some off that fluxajuana, dont know what it is but it sure sounds like I would like it. LOL
---

---
This is the Dec 19th post but you can easily find everything on the website. 
---
First thing I thought when I saw it. It gave the Nuka Cola conspiracy theory room an eerie atmosphere.
---
I steadily play with two dudes in their late 60s. I'm 42. Total hoarders and constantly overweight. Built them both excavator PAs. Changed their world and now we are friends lol. I love it. Best guys I could play with. 
---
What happens if you Nuke the area first, and then after its irradiated, yoy start the event?
---
#5 is named wrong, the one outside in the clubhouse is not chris's message
---
That's like blaming manufacturer of a gun instead of the guy that shoots up a school
---
Probably because of the new event, people are serverhopping like crazy. Plus the Wild Appalachia update probably brought back a few people (me, my gf and my brother included). They should have made the event cooldown for players also, pherhaps once a day or something(and up the rewards maybe?). In my opinion they have come far with the game since launch, but they still dont know how to make an online rpg
---
I see two identifiable landmarks. Watoga is on the right and Robco Research Center is that green building on the left. You're looking to the edge of the map and you are in the mountains to the west of the two landmarks in the photo. That should help you find it.
---
As a low level, thanks for your generosity. I guarantee someone has benefited greatly from your donations. 
---
If this were an accurate simulation, all that you ate and drank would dam up inside you and kill you
---
See I disagree entirely. I do like the game, but they need humans, towns, trading posts, dialog options.
---
I just ran into the bitch on the top of the world and she was like "Go be my bitch" and my character just does it. Like wtf!? Screw you lady do it yourself or die trying. 
---
Honestly can't understand why Rabbits... Cats... Cows....  are all flagged as Hostile....
---
Just joined a friend to help him with the Queen and the entire server crashed. 
---
Not true often the scorch beast takes flight after its death as you chase its corpse across the map
---
No sweat.  If you play on PC, my IGN is Shankwell.  I'm happy to pass along some extra screws, lead, etc or mod out your gun for free.  My camp/hotel is adjacent to the Whitesprings Station with tons of food, a rad shower, three guest bedrooms and whatever else you could need.  My brahmin is not wild about being milked, however.
---
&gt;There are bloodied range weapons too
---
Your exact words were:
---
&gt;someone with unyielding, sentinel, and strength full set with faster swing speed bloodied weapon good luck having a fair fight
---
Now you're just moving the goal posts, but we can go on.
---
&gt;the weakness with bloodied is radiation weapons but not everyone keeps them around let alone good one
---
There are no best gamma guns. It can't be quad, anything that increases damage doesn't increase rad damage, it can't be explosive. A basic gamma gun with signal repeater and deep dish does the same rad damage as the rarest find in the game, and rad damage is what you need.
---
&gt;You could use cavalier unyielding
---
You use a crit or a stagger perk. It goes through all their damage mitigation. It's all basic stuff available to all characters.
---
The point I'm trying to make here is most of the people duping these things don't know how to use them and don't understand the mechanics. If you understand the game mechanics better than your opponent, you're more likely to win. 
---
Centaurs. They are just disturbing as all hell. That and the Mirelurk Kings from 3 or NV. They look like the creature from the black lagoon. 
---
The humans can be dead, but a vault holds 1,000 people. A server holds 23. That makes no fucking sense. There should be people running all over west Virginia 
---
Turn off all their lights :p and make sure you shut the door
---
Laziness comes to mind
---
Do the quests called **Miners miracles**
---
Save yourself the 1,000 caps, haha
---
Apologies but if I ever find you in my camp I will shoot you in the face. 
---
I have beds and all workstations available downstairs and  a locked private quarters upstairs. I don't want people messing with my virtual shit and sleeping in my virtual bed. You could have Radworms. 
---
If you don’t have a witch yet, I have an extra witch but no owl...
---
I went into my house one time and those fuckers turned to look at me.
---
Never went back to that house.
---
Srs just reactive plates and pain train will have most pure bloodied melee builds with few options to take their target down.
---
There is a certain breed of Fallout fan who thinks that every Fallout ever released is the worst ever and completely destroys the franchise. Even if Fallout 1 were released tomorrow totally untouched from the original they'd slag it as the worst ever.
---
In the real world, these sorts of people would be known as "idiots" but apparently game reviewers take a lot of stock in their ideas.  I dunno man.
---
Join us....
---
Sweet, Thanks so much 
---
, however do you know where to receive/start that quest?
---
It's got your email address in it. Just redo it and only give your PSN
---
Later on your vats will improve and become useful. Perks and perception will aid in your using vats. Until then keep aiming 
---
Residential section got kerblammo'd when the infighting occurred. One of the terminals in the mainframe area lists off the status and power consumption levels of various sections of the bunker; residential is listed as "zero contact" and 0% power consumption.
---
Ive had my luck and charisma over 25 no go.
---
I thinking the more parades you do within the same session the percent goes up. Unfortunately my game crashes after 20 mins of the event ending. Every time!
---
just after this comment, i tried again, went to my camp, got my gear ready, clicked on my favourite killing grounds west-tek faciility for super mutants.....
---
crashed to desktop. fantastic
---
I get that but all I am saying it just a temporary fix, 
---
every game you have to start a new characther for PVP and PVE nothing new there.
---
I am just saying it wont matter after a few days or hours, the samething would happen if you for example have been playing for days or weeks before me. 
---
lvl up in the game is really easy, and finding them god tier weapons is not that hard to do if know what your doing. 
---
so after a few days what is to stop ppl to sit on vault 76 and kill everyone that comes out. shit a pipe pistol could do that the same day. 
---
everyone is having their painties in a bunch, and they fail to see that the samething will happen no matter weapons/lvl/gear. 
---
thats me talking without knowing really what rules will bethesda set in place. 
---
You weren't gonna get anything good anyway. 
---
The speedway would be an ideal place for a flea market!
---
Empath is worse than it says. Take rad ex on your alt to suppress all. I noticed I took about 2 to 3 times the damage from certain things after getting empath
---
they will! 
---
i still remember all my brahmin's
---
I like going into people's camps, stripping down to my underwear, throw on some leather armor and my sunglasses and campaign hat,  get on their bed , use the Lay Down emote in photo mode and wait for them to come back to their camp. They come running home and see me sprawled out on their bed..... waiting.....
---
Garan mining HQ? Maybe?
---
Just do a quick web search mate
---
That was the correct quest name
---
Gunpowder got me, too. Awhile back I decided that dammit, I was gonna figure out where all this damn weight was coming from! I actually went through and eyeball added up all the weights from weapons armor and aid, and that still left a lot unaccounted for. Couldn’t be ammo, right? That does start to add up if you’re carrying everything you find, but not enough. Took me forever to even look in the misc category. 
---
First day I played on the same server for over 6 hours.  Did the event six times in a row.  Once every hour.  No change in drops. 
---
What ever possible chance increase in dropping by staying on the same server is negated by not being able to maximize your attempts, being stuck at one per hour.  
---
Yea I heard that he does have them but I have only seen him once in the whole time of playing he is like a ghost 😂👻
---
As a unarmed user. I support this.
---
I've never experienced this to myself. Ive seen it happen and I do not understand why but honestly ive played since beta and never been slapped to death. Normally if someone tries I hope away and wave or just give the tumbs down.
---
Maybe the people on ps4 are nicer? Or maybe my screen name strikes fear into people!
---
Fusion cores from rAndom power frames only spawn 25 percent charge now. You can still server hop in watoga and get 5 of them at a time but if someone else came along and did it you will have to hop until you find a server that someone didn't already take them. Best bet is to take a power plant and set up a fusion generator and farm them that way. 
---
Great. Now everyone is going to do this.
---
No one can access your stash, nor can anyone claim your camp. They can wreck stuff though.
---
Unless you can pick Level 3 locks, you're not getting inside my CAMP, I guarantee it. If I'm home, though, I'll just let you in.
---
Fuck. So I'm stuck with 200 masks lol. If we ever have the ability to place objects in our camps in making a room filled with these reject masks!.
---
I tried a few didnt things like holding up the bots and talking to the leader. For 2 hours of session hoping and playing the leader, when asked, kept repeating "I hope you arent lying" wtf is this supposed to mean. 
---
Well If you can’t find them I can come build some for you. No charge except for the materials!
---
Well If you can’t find them I can come build some for you. No charge, but I’m sure someone will have some spare! 
---
I'm sure it will come back onto the shop eventually. The chance that they made a skin like that available for such a short time is unlikely.
---
It literally takes more than a minute for my camp to load when I first log on, spawning a power armor from my inventory takes about 10 seconds for it to become visible, I had 3 DC's in about a hour yesterday, ... 
---
Yep, I know that feel, bro.
---
i need to kill a rabbit for my challenges but those shit are rarer than a flatwood monster lmao
---
Except you can make those caps without the plan.  So you gain nothing except having the plan.
---
I have enough excess junk, aid, chems, and such that I don’t need to waste 10k on a plan I can just server hop to find at fort prickett.  
---
Is this confirmed 10am EST or 7am PST?
---
May 23rd. 
---
I’m getting back in the game with the new updates, how do I get a dog?
---
If you tame an animal then log out, will he still be there?
---
About time, I need to paint my BoS armor
---
I've still got like 23 cores. Guess it's time to grab an energy weapon to test it out. 
---
Sorry bro, I haven't played WoW for about 5 years.  I was talking about the first 10 years when I was playing and when it was a decent game.  My apologies.  How is world pvp now?  People happy?
---
Well damn, I was starting to think it was you sneaking in and leaving my TV on but I didn’t see your calling card so I guess not, lol. 
---
You really want to sit there and watch your character push out a soft serve?
---
i had a great time playing solo these days, i found hornwright quest, and another one with dyer chemicals sewers, tons of fun reading a lot and discovering new things
---
Good luck on the move 🤙🏻
---
Do you have to do Heart of the Swamp event itself or just go around the river by Dyer Chem when the event is active?
---
I've been getting the infinite load screen lately. It's been a pain in the ass. 
---
That's awesome! Where did you find him?
---
No you can not unless you craft another piece
---
So you’re to blame for the mud everywhere. If you are gonna break in at least wipe your feet.
---
Just think of the cat oil you could trade. 
---
Book of Eli reference 😉
---
Haven't even got a beret yet, which is the one thing I really wanted, though I've got several copies of every other type you have mentioned. None of the "rare" ones.
---
Seems like *nobody* has got any of the rare ones so they're either *actually* super rare, or they just can't drop.
---
Go to the parade, tons of them can be found..
---
Thanks for letting me know. Any reason it's that low or you just trying to scam me?
---
Chugga chugga chugga chugga.... toooooot, toooooooooooooooot
---
Ah thanks 👌 I'm on tonight in UK so if I can't find one until then il give u a comment on here 👍
---
Yeah. I remember being very excited by it. It reminded me of Point Lookout from Fallout 3. 
---
For daily use, a Gatling gun is good, as it has high damage per shot and cheap ammo. For fighting tougher enemies such as the SBQ, the 50 cal or lmg are good, although ammo for the lmg is very expensive. The Gatling laser is good too, but you want the power user perk with that, as it eats thorough cores. The flamer and cryolator have very expensive ammo, but the flamer has excellet dps and awful range. The Gatling plasma has good damage, but is hard to aim. The harpoon gun has good damage but awful reload. The mini gun has poor damage, and eats through ammo. 
---
Its pretty funny
---
I even give my characters grey hair and wrinkles. :-D
---
Murder is 'part of the game' but 'rape is too far'.
---
Different cultures have different standards as to what is and is not acceptable in mixed company.
---
Not saying this is right or wrong, just saying that popping 'fake drugs' is acceptable but smoking 'fake cigarettes', yes, is that bridge too far.
---
I did take it as a friendly response. Got rid of the mods and have now tested them one after another to see which is the faulty one. No more fall out in Fallout ... Eh!
---
A big group of small animals spawns East of town  near the road. It’s usually a group of about ten squirrels, opossums, rabbits, and chickens.
---
I’m the total opposite, I love them all. 
---
In fact I own a PS4 because of fallout, it’s the only game I play on it, sure it has issues but hey don’t we all. 
---
I don’t listen to the negativity, if these fools who slag off at the game are so brilliant, where’s their creation.  
---
Hey Thanks! 
---
Delete this dont use email only give psn. People can dm you on here and on ps, no need for email
---
It's not impressive, just a nice option to have in your C.A.M.P. 
---
Oh damn. The fire dmg doesn't stack. Thats lame.  TiL...
---
So yeah.. all rise. Thats it
---
ok thank you
---
At the start it feels like it takes forever to charge your crit meter by using VATS, but it will get better later.  And with the right perks in the Luck category, you will be able to snap off crit shots every 2-3 shots in VATS.  
---
Yes you can use it to kill scorchbeasts faster larer on.
---
There is another one on your route around step 7. When you go through the wall with the vehicle, head to the street, turn left and the tall building with the "Books" sign has one at the top of the fire escape.
---
^This.  I am like you though OP, patiently waiting for that sale.  
---
Fuck the kids. 
---
Even better in Zero G
---
Remember to close your mouth!
---
It starts the event like normal but everything is much higher level and no small critters spawn so if you get the butcher, you can’t complete the event.
---
I mean. That’s a silly complaint. Imagine a server with 1000 people lmao.
---
I decided to become a wasteland chem dealer so I just built a secret room with all my chem and brewing stations, but the door is just a huge bookshelf I have to move over every time. The nuka cola machine door would be perfect. 
---
Also we should be able to refrigerate Nuka-Colas in the Nuka-Cola machines, I just want an ICE COLD Nuka-Cola to hit the spot and butter my muffins. 
---
Liberator Bots.... those dirty commie scum!
---
Some weapons had it removed because it made no sense because it says “bullets explode for area damage” and the cryolator/flamer/laser weapons don’t shoot bullets
---
It’s a rare drop from the faschnact event, 1 in a sillion chance 
---
I do that exact same thing. If someone is obviously trying to keep people out I will find any way possible (with out breaking their camp of course) to get in. But if you don't mind I would like to steal that calling card idea from you because that's a pretty good idea.
---
Oh?! I'm gonna have to look for that one when I get back ingame later.
---
Lol I saw some kid buy a bomber jacket for 750 caps
---
For whatever reason, even when it's lootable, I don't get any loot from it :(
---
not just PS4, i did the event around 6 times last night and all 6 times it got glitch, I dont even borther with him anymore
---
Ballistic Weapons should still get the effect. Got an Explosive Hunting Rifle the other day.
---
It s like an auto aim in this game. When ur usin crit hits it can really boost ur damage.
---
Yes, but image one with 23. Just as ridiculous. There should be at least 100 people. It would just feel more realistic and it would be cool to run into people doing the same mission and you can team up. Just like regular MMOs
---
Woah, cigarettes are addictive and may ruin your life!! 😉
---
If you don’t do that quest, Enclave Bunker sells them.
---
Hahaha, I enjoy bringing a fatman and nuking the bonfire.
---
I’ve done the event a couple of times. Both times what looked like the entire map population turned up but it didn’t crash then or disconnect. Still, it does sound like it’s connected to the event somehow at least.
---
Mole Miners scared the shit out of me the first time I encountered them. 
---
Must be that heavy breathing..  
---
100 to 300 atoms please
---
The bombs fell 25 years ago... The chances of it remembering anything before that is slim.
---
Stupid turrets... Can't kill the fucking ghoul attavking the brahmin or the junk extractor in the camp... But damn if they won't go ham on a fuck cat. 
---
I just wanna see someone in game with one. Just so I feel like ppl are actually getting them. I kno there’s been a few but it’s just frustrating. 
---
Watoga and Sentry Bot at Whitesprings, get that’s there and hop servers.
---
It's more of a social event and every experience of it has been unique and wonderful. I just wish it wasn't a time sink to actually find the event. 
---
There is a billboard above the highway that has a small abandoned settler camp, and it's full of cats.
---
And yes... You can place your camp there.
---
I can't remember it's location as I stumbled upon it a month or so ago, but I'm sure you can Google it. 
---
Same! Bought the PS4 for F4, stayed for F76. 
---
Oh and Horizon Zero Dawn. 
---
Furever home. 
---
You’re the real mysterious stranger
---
I jump into the first server and either the event is going on or starts after 10-15 minutes. I've never had a problem with the event. Ill end up doing the event about 5 times in the same server.Im on ps4 as well.
---
Your camp spot is yours and yours only. If you leave your building unlocked anyone can use your work benches, beds. The stash box will only ever show a player their own inventory. Anyone can grab crops. If you have water purifiers or resource extractors you can lock those to prevent players from taking your stuff, or leave them open to share. People can destroy your camp and anything in it. It will flag them as wanted and you can repair it all using the camp kit if you have the resources. 
---
Vats can be a way to boost your damage. How depends on playstyle and build. For example, the Concentrated Fire perk gives you an accuracy and damage bonus for every shot fired at the same limb. Target the enemies 'weak point' for a cool x2 damage boost! 
---
You also gain the ability to use critical hits. A critical hit adds another instance of damage equal to the unmodified damage number of your gun. It also gives you 100% accuracy. There are perks, a mutation, legendary weapons, and several types of food which can increase your critical damage. 
---
Critical hits used to be extremely good on automatic weapons, but due to a recent nerf, they are utter garbage as automatic weapons have the lowest base damage in the game (that's the number criticals use for their damage).
---
Let me throw some numbers at you for a vats-centric pistol build. At level 50, the Black Powder Pistol deals about 175 damage per shot. With my near ideal perk setup, it deals 301 damage per shot. I stack some crazy bonuses though. My sneak attacks do 2.5x damage. Head shots are x2 damage. My critical hits deal x1.85 damage. The math ends up looking like this for my sneak attack head shot critical hits:
---
301(sneakattack X headshot)+175 X criticalmultiplier
---
301(2.5 X 2)+175 X 1.85=
---
1,828.75 damage
---
As you can see, Vats can lead to a very nice damage boost.
---
Wait, you guys sit when you poop? That sounds tons easier than how I've been doing it.
---
Explosive ballistic weapons still drop, but they are pretty rare, like every 300 legendaries encountered can yield one on average.
---
Yes yes yes!!!!!
---
I really like the Gatling plasma, it’s probably my favorite big gun (: 
---
I got a mutants explosive pump from the queen yesterday so I dont think so.
---
I think it's your actual name, but regardless, could you stop acting like such a Topher?
---
Did you get the mutation while dying? If so it’s glitched and you need to get rid of it sadly 
---
I just did a coast to coast move going the other way. Hopefully you have plenty of stops planned. It’s one hell of a drive.
---
I did yes. That answers my question then, thanks.
---
I miss the message that my workshop is contested all the time.  
---
Glad to help
---
Ps4 here...the alternative is just dont have the high levels kill it right away.
---
Let it roam for a second.
---
Last event i did we had (10) people below 50s and 4 plus 150s... i switched to my lowest dmg weapons but TSEs couldnt help themselves...no loot...let the event end...waited got usless legendaries
---
but point is...for anyone who sees it
---
youre leveled past 50 (only one other FO game mattered past 50) if youre with 20s and 30s...let them get their shots...just stay on top of the suicide bombers...radfrogs are weak at level 20+
---
One (sometimes two) megasloth(s) are managable in a 10 plus person event
---
Hi, I've never played this game yet. What level do you need to be in order to do this? I just want to understand how powerful you need to be. What would you do immediately at lvl 1?
---
lmao, best story,( from holy shit I found the loot paradise, to Oh shit that was my loot and I just lost everything), it sucks but funny. If you are in XBOX i would love to help you in what i can
---
I didn’t have 10 grand for it 
---
That’s totally fair. 
---
So... Beside the Vault? 
---
190 is usually what I weigh when I have most my junk in the stash and 3-4 weapons on me.
---
My carry limit is 245 / 345 / 445 depending on whether I'm without power armor, in my T51 or the Excavator.
---
I have most of the weight perks except strong back and am a heavy weapons power armor build.
---
I literally live in my armor, only leaving it to sleep and use work benches.
---
Unsure as to where exactly but there are posters all over that have the Excavator power armor featured on them, if you click on them they give the quest.
---
Also the Garrahan mining HQ is in the ash heap behind the three high rise buildings visible on the map.
---
they stay
---
Saw someone at 687 and ran to tell my discord and ask if anyone say someone higher. He was farming the fasnacht event and left promptly when he found the event wasn’t active in the server we were in. Definitely a jaw dropping experience 
---
Go check the control pad.
---
Yeah sadly I doubt fallout 76 will be able to manage being a real survival game.
---
Scum has a lot of survival micro management that isn’t too difficult and makes it interesting in terms of what stuff you need to scavenge and eat.
---
You build most things you use, you can loot weps and ammunition and clothing, you can also make them.
---
It’s a really fun game 
---
That would look fantastic!
---
Probably not rare, but the VTU jacket outift (blue) 
---
This game doesn’t even have droppable objects and you think Bethesda would make a door? Come on
---
Hey caedo! 
---
I knew about a lot of the armor in the game. But I did not know about the different jump suits.
---
Grabbing all the rare armors in the game certainly brought more life in the game for me. Until survival mode drops that is :p
---
-nickaroo93
---
Whoa calm down there Mr. Jackson! 
---
Had a wonderful, just WONDERFUL player give me a Fastnacht sausage recipe today which I've been after since the event started. Didn't even charge for it, just tossed it over.  
---
I won't get my missing plans, or the beret, this year, but teh sausage was a huge nice thing and I plan on tossing extra stuff around tomorrow night where I can.   
---
Last night of Fastnacht starts in 16 hours! Get your giving on!
---
That's interesting... I've been at Helevetia in a server for over an hour without it triggering. 
---
If you're on PC and want to sell it, let me know, I'd be interested! 
---
Really depends how you play the game. If you're trying to unlock a lot of armor &amp; weapon mods then you'll go through a massive quantity of scrap. If you want the Excavator armor then you'll need a big pile of screws and black titanium. If you're playing non-PA after level 30 then you'll need ballistic fiber. Aluminium and adhesive are commonly required for repairs, plus screws for weapon modding.
---
In general, collect all screws, and make a note of any location you explore that has a useful quantity of a particular material in case you need it later. If you simply loot everything then you'll run out of stash.
---
I like running Travelling Pharmacy so I can loot all the meds and worry about them later, but that's a preference thing. The armor weight reduction perk is inferior to Strong Back unless you're carrying multiple sets.
---
If you're on PC and in the EU, send me a message and I'll happily gank them for you until they server hop! 
---
Always check the blue suitcase at stations (every station has one) and the ice machine at the white spring resort. I usually dump there all the legendaries I cannot use. Plus plans, treasure maps and junk.
---
Not heard of such thing
---
I'm on PS4 but on PC i have a level 5 executioners explosive hunting rifle 3*.
---
You're roleplaying as an \*\*\*hole
---
If you have conduits you can take the conduit intersection (a wire node, with 4 conduit pieces in the shape of a cross attached to it) there's a variant with just one node. Place it where the roof and the wall meet. 
---
The conduit bit will actually poke outside the building. Attach that same piece again to the other end of it. You'll have a wire node inside and one outside. Wire it up to the door, and the one inside to a switch, and voila.
---
Dead game
---
Ok just to be clear, i’m not doing this, just mocking people who nukes Helvetia and says their roleplaying as a raider. 
---
To lose weight fast scrap all of your junk. Some junk can be turned into bulk junk. Which can then be sold to vendors. I try to keep less than 5 of any bulked item in my stash. Starting out I use to keep every booble head I found so that I could use it at the perfect time. The problem it was in my stash at that moment and I was no were near the stash. So they all got forgotten. So now I either use them right away or sell them. At one pound a piece they take up alot of space. If you have any plans or recipes make sure to read them. Any known plans or recipes give away or sell to someone. If you have alot of no star weapons in your stash. Sell or scrap them. You will often learn mods for weapons when you srap them. The same thing happens with armor. There are perk cards that will help with carry weight. They don't help the same items when you put them in your stash. For instance at 20 lb missile launcher can weight 1.8 lbs on you with the Bear Arms perk card maxed out. However, it will be 20 lbs in your stash. 
---
Finally, weight management is your new task while playing this game. And it will never end. I have seen every bump in stash box storage. And I somehow filled it the first day of seeing the increase.
---
You can.  I leave spare ammo in there all the time.
---
İ got Mine for 1.3k
---
You might have placed it in a location that has been flagged for future content. Maybe. Otherwise the game has a moment and needs a snickers 
---
I think the fusion generator spawns and Annihilator drops might be fixed to 50% charge too, although I've only tried a few so far. I guess they really want people to get PvP'd.
---
Stacking power armor frames, eh?  
---
Good to see Rust cancer tactics still live on today.
---
Oh hey man! Yeah I'm apprehensive about the Survival stuff, I'm definitely not a PVP guy. I'm sure you'll tell us how it is though once it's out! Actually, I have an idea...
---
It is at the very bottom of the map, like we’re talking touching the world border, unless they’re expanding the playable area, this is probably a bug
---
Welcome to the internet where everyone can be a right cunt.
---
Reminds me of a LAN party some years ago.
---
A buddy camp over and had spotted a wallhacking, aimbotting lowlife in the COD server we had setup.
---
I went over, turned off his PC and when he started to chime up, I left a big slimey booger right in his keyboard. He was probably 8, I was 30. All worth it. Little shit. 
---
Like a hole in the head...
---
higher lv i have seen was 648 about a month ago. 
---
cool, figured there was more new stuff they added to the tameable pool. 
---
Tbh. With its slow fire rate and being prone to breaking rather fast. I’d go no more that 800-900. 
---
Honestly it seems great, maybe grab any more damage you can in str and just take off the dmg cards when you need to fast travel but yeah very nice
---
I mean there’s room to do so. Who knows. 
---
Yea I’ve definitely got some spots I’d like to stop along the way. Hope your journey was safe and enjoyable! 
---
I wished for the same exact thing so I just put a nuka cola machine in front of a door and pretend its functional whenever I move it in build mode. 
---
I hope they expand it!
---
Yes, so long as it doesn't come with the usual selection of brain dead game breaking bugs....
---
Those would be some fun fights, imagine the line at the dmv quest 
---
I want that but I haven’t been able to find it yet!
---
Weird. Ive never had an issue with it.
---
Where'd you get this one?
---
Yeah not worth it. Much better to just pay the 10 caps or so for the drink itself.
---
My best drop ever, and my primary weapon from level 70 to level 185 so far is my 2* instigating gauss with +50% limb damage.  I love that heavy bastard.  Now if I could just find an instigating, +50% critical damage and -25% ap cost gauss... I guess I wouldn't need any more weapons.  BTW for anyone who uses gauss as ur main weapon batteries included is a must have.  Works on fusion cores too
---
Yeah I was thinking about taking a point in martial artist off and maybe a point in endurance off and upping expert slugger for an extra 10% damage. Thanks a ton!
---
It says nothing. But the one for Dome 7 also says nothing even though you can get in it for the Quantum skin
---
Are you people just gonna post threads like this whenever a DLC in a new are of the map when gets released? 
---
Idk if it has any effect to the event or not. But everytime an event was over, everyone left the town. Nobody stayed in it. Once the event came back it was flooded with players. Maybe leave the town and try and see if that works.
---
found you
---
Horrible writing. Multiple instances of it not even following its own internal lore let alone fallout lore. The fact that companions are so hardcoded to be unkillable its impossible to even mod them to be.
---
Daft Punk... after the apocalypse!
---
(PS4) I actually saw one player wearing this - but again no way to confirm they didn’t get it from Dev room I guess. I’ve done about 200 events now and nada for any rare drops. Still looking for that elusive bonfire / old man winter effigy!
---
Yeah, I'm really enjoying it, when I can get it to work. I always feel like a slaggart, but half the time I can't manage to get anything to really work. Sometimes I can't even see the robots. But I try. And it's fun. So....oh well. 
---
If you're patient the sloth meat piles every time, for me at least. Takes WAY longer than it should, but it does. 
---
I think the logic is that the drugs and liquor names are made up so they fall into the "fantasy" area. But smokes are smokes, cant have that on my killing/looting/gore simulaor, no...
---
Both times I've found him around or near the Sunshine Meadows workshop.
---
Gunpowder, missiles, and mini-nukes are heavier than you think!  If you have these in excess consider selling them to other players!
---
Xbox? If so, how?
---
125 weight.... how?....
---
"Stares at his eternal 768-800 stash weight.."
---
... How?? 😓
---
I'm getting rid of my jukeboxes since they turn themselves on each playing different music every time I return to my camp
---
15 minutes?
---
Try 75% of my play time
---
Me too man
---
Did you move your CAMP Workbench after you initially dropped it?
---
I've given away better. Its not always about the caps either.
---
Just hit the river. We skipped event.
---
Well, if you are casual, just play for fun and the event will pop up in about an hour or so.
---
I am a very casual player, never did server hop for anything. Just enjoying the lore and the visuals. 
---
Looks fine, although 5 points in Adrenaline is a bit of a luxury. I'd rather have more Action Boy for Dodgy. 3 point Incisor might be wasted depending on your damage numbers.
---
Oh on my player. 
---
Preach 
---
I thought Charleston Train Station was having one once, but no... someone in excavator armor was stuck in running mode while buying stuff from the vendor there.
---
I got one of those. Still looking for the space suit, tho.
---
What if it was a 3 star legendary
---
Yes let’s have Chris explain this.

His hands may go numb:

60+ tries Bethesda like really? For the people who actually play this game for like two hours I feel like they just gave up on the game already. This parade messed up so much and you can't even get us the masks we try so hard for. Instead we have to buy them off dupers when it gets out they have them after the event. Big thumbs up you just keep being you
---
A bit late, but here’s my two cents.
---
For me the true endgame is finding nice places to build camps. I have just reached the main story line since first playing during the beta, basically milking my time through each quest. 
---
I’ve loved the building mechanic since fo4. Creating camps in bizarre and clever places is a lot of fun for me. I find laying down foundations and decorating to be somewhat therapeutic. 
---
I agree that there really isn’t an endgame, and additional content comes in slow waves for this game. After a two month hiatus I picked 76 up again for the Fasnacht event, and managed to play the booze quest as well. 
---
Overall it’s really up to the player. Depending on what you want to get out of playing. I believe that Bethesda has laid down a great foundation for letting your imagination and creativity take the reigns of the “story,” or in this case your head canon. 
---
I’m sure once I get burned out again, the next big update will be enough to have me return to the game over incremental periods of time. 
---
I set mine up at Carhenge in Savage Divide, I get Super Mutants attacking every other time I fast travel there. Can't wait for vendors to pop up just to sell ammo, booze, chems and raider armor. Waiting for survival mode just to rack up bounties. 
---
Depends if you want speed or oomph. Death Tambo is a fun weapon. Also any legendaries tagged furious are a good find for melee.
---
Adderall is a combo of amphetamines and dextroamphetamines. "Meth" is a methyl group away from dextroamphetamine. (n-dextroMethylamphetamine and  levomethamphetamine iirc.) That extra methyl group makes a pretty big difference in how it metabolizes, but felt like it needed to be said. 
---
True, I had Action Boy awhile back but switched it out for increased endurance, Ill switch some points in agility around a bit.
---
To my knowledge there are no paints or skins which can be earned in game, it's all via the Atom Store. 
---
I have 125 weight of just different outfits and they only .1 a piece
---
My calling card is salt, I leave salt with their junk. 
---
Its not broken. Beth has said the current rates are correct and they wouldn't lie or try to cover their own butts. Regardless I doubt we'll get any sort of change before the event ends so your time is probably better spent doing more interesting things than running the same parade route 60 more times. I've done it probably close to 100 at this point and it's just miserable not getting any rare masks. 
---
I want that Pirate mask. It'd really strike fear into folks I think.
---
Would be realistic if they also give a small amount of rads. (virtually all smoke produces measurable radiation. cheap Smoke detectors are really just low grade radiation detectors)
---
I did this with greek letters on my friends camp lol. 
---
you talking about the PA paint?
---
if so I only know off 2 that ypu can find the plans
---
the nuka-cola paint = dome 3
---
the quamtum cola paint for the X01 dome 7.( i did it yesterday with no problems, before I tried and the keys to the dome was always missing. ( I also everytime I am on the area I open the door but I do not take the plans, unfortuanally for you I am on XBOX
---
Put this down on my wish list too. I'd love one!
---
Because i wanted the rare masks and i could do the event 3-4 times an hour.
---
I am lvl 108 and never saw Mothman. Any place in particular I need to go to see him?
---
A few of the level ones are new, the chicken for one. 
---
At the same time, when you haven’t seen one for a while you start to get worried
---
I do too, not everytime it has become less and less, I know what too look for, but more importanly how you only have 125 pounds off weight in your stash. no weapons/gear and just little junk?
---
It does, seen three camps with it now. IT is just rare like getting the greek letters.
---
Hahahahaha, clear. Sorry.
---
Ive had that happen once, stayed on a server with a friend and the event never showed 
---
Yurmom so scary that the Schorchbeast Queen thinks she’s glitched invincible
---
/r/fallout76settlements
---
no 125 person weight 
---
First time logging on yesterday in weeks, appeared a hop and skip away from my camp. I know it's anecdotal, but didn't see a problem from my side. 
---
Not too much. It suffers much the same way the shotguns do with the 2shot prefix. 2 shot only adds one extra projectile, so instead of firing 4 with a normal dragon it fires 5. Not a huge increase in power and I'd say it's worth 750-1500c depending on the system and time of day.
---
I've got about 100 masks now, all the plans plus lots of duplicates, and no rare masks. I still run it with hope, but it's not a very good use of time in game any longer.
---
somerset i got at lvl5, was nice for lvling a new character. 
---
And my mum
---
I'll go all existential on you and say it's worth what ever someone is willing to pay for me that's zero
---
Well.. considering you do not have that much of a sterile location to cook that correctly and using tainted fruit I would guess it is spoilable in a time of about 2 to 3 months. When I make Jam myself I have to freeze them to preseve them for longer because I do not have sterile hygene for my kitchen. (I'm a bit sloppy.)  
---
Considering moving Jam from the stove to the chemics workbench, this might be plausible for me.  
---
Consider it from the stand point of being suspended then un-suspended, then re-suspended. All with no notice or chance to dispute it, for a reason you still aren't entirely sure why. Then I just get called a cheater by the community I try to help. I got griefed by Bethesda directly. That destroyed all my enthusiasm and I don't want to help other players anymore. I deleted all the guides I wrote. This place doesn't deserve them.
---
As a parent, 100% agree.   
---
Had to have the conversation recently with my 6yo about what appropriate and inappropriate behavior in video game vs real life is. She was building towns replete with animals and people in minecraft, then sending the entire thing into the fiery inferno with massive TNT complexes. I was impressed by the creativity with which she wrought such destruction, but it concerned me.  
---
Her justification: "its just a video game, dude. Its not like I'd actually hurt an animal." (she can be too rough with our ferrets, so its something i monitor pretty closely)  
---
I currently vape, but was a smoker for many years. I'm pretty much her hero. (dunno why, im not that cool. I guess I do feed her, most of the time) My kid knows how i feel about my addiction. It bothers her that I smoke, and I encourage that reaction. Both because its helping me quit, and because it tempers her resolve against smoking. Hopefully, she never will. If she chooses to as an adult, that'll be her mistake to make. I highly doubt it will be a character from a game that inspires her to smoke.   
---
I grew up in the 80s, when smoking was advertised. (ive prob still got some camel/marlboro gear around somewhere) I was vehemently against cigarettes, until my friends weren't. There was never the "do it" peer pressure from my freinds. It was simply available to me and that was enough. 
---
You can kill them in vanilla, so I don't know where you're pulling that info from. 
---
Sometimes I leave bags of stuff that would spoil too quick or heavy weapons Ican't sell anymore because of weight limit.  
---
I always search for people buying stuff but I don't care giving them away as well.
---
If you summon the queen and then launch a nuke on it would that be an insta kill or would it not work
---
I've played this game for 1100+ hours and experienced being griefed in pvp ONE time. And it was my fault for trying to take a bounty then seeking revenge on a group of 3 players. 
---
I have never in my 1100+ hours been harassed by someone slapping me non-stop. Do these encounters happen while you're in a common area? Like a train station or whitesprings? Or are players seeking you out while you farm to attack you?
---
This is the build I run with, along with mutations and 5 pieces of unyielding armor https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4545f8&amp;d=sb0s41sf2ss2sg2se2p70pe2el0er2eu0c72i44a80s71aj2ar2ao0a04lt2lu2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Yes I have a mic and if you want to do that then the help would be greatly appreciated ;)
---
I learned the BoS mod from scrapping, just takes a lot of scrapping. If you do the enclave and BoS quests, you'll get quite a few regular pieces of combat armor you can scrap to learn the mod.
---
What times do you play?
---
The Ash Heap isn't big enough to merit fast travelling if you're doing this, really. Maybe it would cost -you- caps server hopping and FT but it wouldn't cost me, might even clear some groups of mobs on the way to the new mine for weapons to sell.
---
So are you compiling a list as well? Maybe we should combine what we know and release it as a guide together? I have some you don't have and already a lot of very descriptive directions to the stashes pre-written, and you know plenty of locations I don't. And as far as I know there isn't a big, comprehensive guide to stash locations out there post-nerf, which is why I was doing this in the first place. Going to be busy tomorrow, but I will check back every so often. :)
---
Thanks for the list!  That will help.  Hopefully, I can get this challenge before it expires.  Once I get home from work, I'll have just under 24 hours.
---
if you like hard candy, Lemon drops help the oral fixation and the cravings. Something to do with the limonene IIRC.   
---
Also, allocate the money you would have spent on cigs to another thing you love to do. Take that \~$40/week and spend it something tangible that you can interact with regularly. Remind yourself why youre quitting when you play with/use said thing (I built up my leather-working tools collection)   
---
The mental prep is prob the biggest component. I was able to ditch them for about 2 weeks (dropped the physical addiction for a while) before falling back in, and finally switching to vaping . I make my own juices, so I can control how much nicotine im getting. Gone from 10mg/ml to about \~4.5 over the last year. Dropping it slowly each time i rebatch. Aiming to have quit by end of this year.
---
I see people selling em for 100-250 caps, just depends on the buyer and market.
---
4pm-10pm GMT
---
Garrahan mining headquarters has 3 indoor areas with like 15-20+ enemies each, but each area is technically outdoors so you still get nuked crafting materials. If you're on a server solo try nuking an area with a ton of indoor areas if you don't care about flux. Way more enemies.
---
I logged into a server to myself this morning and nuked whitesprings as the first thing I did. In the hour I was farming the area, the golf club itself never once respawned. Hell the golf club never actually spawned glowing ghouls once. The other buildings did, but respawns where slow. The guard robots where really the only thing that respawned constantly. And most times they respawned fighting something.
---
Have they fixed the issue where you need to repair the V FAST melee weapons beyond 100% to be able to use'em? If not I'd prefer they do that first.
---
This^ Also, I have a habit of dropping things in the blue lunchbox in Watoga station. 
---
If you’re on PS4 I have spares of all the nuka cola outfits 
---
This has genuinely made me really sad and I don’t even have a good reason why. Feel like I might cry over a goddamn virtual kitten.  
---
250-350 is pretty typical on PC
---
This would be perfect....we could make secret rooooooooms
---
Ah bummer, I’m on Xbox
---
Basically what ATX said its all cosmetic stuff, but long coat can sell for decent amount of caps since I usually just see clean versions of outfits. He also sells purple skii outfit and most times the 2nd item is cosmetic item you can find static in the map like spacesuit, civil war hats or outfits, etc. Still he is a better special vendor then Grahm since most plans are available at vendors I don't see anything special with him anymore.
---
9/10 wasteland medics recommend not doing that
---
Just curious, why was this post removed?
---
another method im fairly sure could be employed. If only i had friends.

I am willing to join your raider gang. Although I would suggest having camps placed as far from each other and from train stations as possible in order to lessen the walking distance to anywhere on the map should we need to get somewhere quick. My PSN is ObesePigeon1

Yes, it definitely buffs my powerfist
---
I'm just doing this for plans, now. Party decorations are great!
---
I'd love a Jester mask, but I _know_ it won't happen.
---
Yes, does nothing. Because Bethesda are Sadists.
---
I’ve seen 75 -250. 
---
It's very satisfying once you finish cleaning up making room an bulking junk and logging for the night.
---
Seriously. They were absolutely not killed through slap damage unless they were on death’s door already. Perhaps they were teamed up with someone who had a workshop and it was contested by someone who was teamed with the person who shot them at the vendor. In any case, it’s not possible to one shot someone from full to dead via slap damage. 
---
Yeah that’s not an exploit. 
---
I just wish we could "level up" these unique items in the same way we can upgrade the Order of Mysteries weapons so we wouldn't have to wait until 50 before we could actually do any of the good quests.
---
Generally that's because you haven't hit it. Try shooting it as soon as it spawns a couple times so you can guarantee yourself loot. 
---
tbh I don't think I'll ever get my head on right again. \*\_\*
---
Haha reminded me of the holotape over at the lighthouse by vault 76!
---
Proof? Cause idk about that
---
I paid 300 I think, but that was a little while ago, probably cheaper now. 
---
I wish i knew that i finished the quests at level 39
---
That seems good in general except for one thing. Why not only put 1 point in slugger, and a second point in expert slugger for +20% damage instead of +15%
---
Some Addictol and Steady ought to flush out your system. I'm gonna write up a prescription for that and recommend plenty of bedrest. And lay off the booze 
---
One of the Fasnacht berets? Or are there others?

So basically we have to do 9k runs to get one? （´ー｀）

That is fucking hilarious.

This is a really funny joke.  Kudos to you sir.

Not going to lie. I miss read the last word as "inbreeding". Lol

Scorched beasts i am just too low to kill them and i allways get seen by them
---
Cool, that's 11 AM-5 PM for me. You can add me via the "social" menu option in game and I'll accept the friend request.
---
Alright cool thanks mate
---
Weird. What level are you? Also do you have a camp?
---
Yup had that. If this is what it was like at release I can see why it had such bad press.
---
Well, scorchbeast don't count as scorched, but as animals from my knowleage. So this will work only on basic scorched and they are little bit stronger than ghouls, most of weapons kills them in one shot.
---
Who needs a Nuke when you can spam talking to the parade leader for 20 minutes and no-one can attack you.
---
what do you mean run my alt?
---
i would help you, but I would use my main and you your alt. also im xbox one. 
---
One of the many sad things i ran into was a note on a random scorched it said something along the lines of ''I got infected by the scorched but somebody has got to be the first to survive this''
---
I’ll give you a challenge if you can break into my camp in the mire on my main character I’ll give you a thousand caps, (Xbox) gt: shadowfoxxtrk20

Ok that does it, time to grab the animal taming perks. That's freaking fantastic.

Not really, you can't just put the paint job on. To get another "Prototype" you'd have to craft a whole new part and leave the paint on it.

I wish this were more visible, haven't messed with the supply drops since Jan. Told my bro it was fine, then he became wanted. Had to Google it just to make sure thankfully this was like top result on Google for me.

I'm keeping an eye on Reddit to see if the masks start coming through towards the end of this event because I am so sick of it I don't want to do it if it stays the same vault tec experiment. I played FO4 for three years only because third party modders became involved and made the game interesting. Now we are at Bethsedas mercy and its not going well.

Level 96 with a camp at New Gad lake (south of Summersville) and about 150 hours on my main character
---
I've done a couple of Brotherhood paint jobs for friends who haven't unlocked the plans yet, so I'm sure there would be at least *some* kind of market for it. Dunno how many people would be willing to trust a complete stranger with their power armor, though.

you get it when you finish the excavator quest, or 1k something cast at one off the vendors dont remeber which one

This is not an MMO. There’s nothing “Massively Multiplayer” about it.
---
This is Fallout.
---
Fallout has traditionally been a single-player game, and the idea of an MMO entry into the series was bound to have a large section of the fan base worried.
---
I know what “regular” MMOs are like...there are plenty of them. I didn’t want that for this game. I didn’t want an MMO with a Fallout skin. What I wanted was a Fallout game that I could play with my friends.
---
You don’t make a Fallout game and then turn it into WoW. 
---
Since the last update I go through more food and water and made food spoils so quick.
---
Is it the one where you can walk out to the top of the billboard? Widow's Walk I think it's called..?
---
Aww man that’s a total bummer....
---
Experienced that a couple times. Just recently found an area I’d like to settle into for a while. Until I get booted of course, but then it’s on to the next! I wish you luck with your camps in the future. 
---
I would say start with the perks that give you melle damage and then work on you QoL perks, as far weapon is depending what you want to do, I think the All Rise is a well all around melee weapon but they are some better ones. 
---
Players have been complaining about workshop PVP outside the workshop circle ring area since... idk, the beginning perhaps (3-4 months)? And Bethesda didn't do anything about it. So it's either :
---
A. It is intended.
---
B. It must be too hard for the game developer to make a script / code to turn off PVP slap / damage outside the workshop circle ring.
---
Yeah, this is a good counter to this weird cringe.
---
If this were an accurate simulation we'd all die five minutes after leaving the vault. Just cause something's "accurate" that doesn't always mean it needs to be in a game.
---
I'd be fine with a cosmetic cigarette
---
Yeah was roleplaying as a responder and realized the scorched i just killed was wearing the same uniform that i have :( 
---
I've had a custom ini file since the game started and never had any problem except for having the game run smoother.
---
It's the same for all rank 1-3 safe boxes too. I farmed rare weapon plan back there with the same method (before they released all weapon plans on vendor bots)
---
I think you should be OK.  ( replying for a friend ).

Id assume their doing server matching based on Ping stats, thus (generally) whichever server is closest to you. Which is why sometimes you get the same. sometimes its diff.   
---
Maybe ill find some time and can run a network capture and follow some packets to find out.
---
On Xbox? I’ll buy the outfit from you! I already have the T51 NukaCola paint job but definitely will want the X01 quantum paint for when I eventually finish the story and get one of those lol
---
It literally took my 15 minutes, after 6 hour play session. I was constantly over the limit, most of the times 500-600 over my 250 player limit. Crossing the map from end to end to complete the BoS quests and selling to the vendors. At whitespings station, I bulked, crafted ammo and sold my excess junk. Now I am at 260, only 10 lbs above my limit. But I am chugging beers almost all the time, so it doesn't bother me at all.
---
i saw hat as well you have to run around the nuke zone in a circle, I nuked there yesterday and for the first few circles nothing was there but by the 3rd rounds they spawned and every round there after.
---
total I got 25 2 and 3 \* weapons and gear. I also lvled up 4 times from 76 to 80.
---
they are there you just need to know how to call them out. 
---
that was there, it just tells you a little back story
---
Great to see other people appreciating Assaultrons, they really are just the best robots. I miss the good ol' days of having my big metal laser-face wife follow me around in FO4.
---
fist weapons are considered unarmed
---
Yes. Beth said that they drop, but extremely low chance. They didn’t say anything about upping percentages for this event but mentioned something along the lines about improvement in future events, yadda yadda. 
---
Yeah, thanks, it's happened once or twice before now, but this one just really got to me :/
---
Same here.
---
 I'd like a jester mask, but I don't think I'd actually wear it instead of the owl one. But what I really want are all the fir decorations.
---
It’s not like that at all. Lmao in this case the action is within bounds of what is allowed in the game. 
---
It would be nice, hard to get all my friends on the same system, we're scattered.
---
Ran up on a lvl 540 the other day tried pvp with him but his hoe of lvl 90 ended me very quickly, so for those who come across the trap I did don’t fall for it, they will take your caps every single time, only managed to kill the lvl 90 1/20 times, lost 2000 caps messing around with these guys but it was entertaining to say the least couldn’t even get close to the lvl 540 after first encounter. They used every trick to kill me 
---
I think it would be fun to play a nuked Helvetia event, especially after doing it several times. Nothin wrong with spicing it up, it’s not like nuking the place breaks any rules. 
---
Why is this comment downvoted but no comments were left explaining what’s the correct method is or why this wouldn’t be the thing to do?
---
Our queen hunting group was able to put SBQ down in 2minutes even after TSE nerf. Saidly bethesda broken adrenal reaction mutation in one patch and since that i am alone. I am glad we killed her over 100times, because i would not be able to do so now.
---
Yeah, waited to kill the ten golf ghoul and now they don't spawn (or i'm not looking at the right place, the laundry building).
---
I cannot say 'you won't get banned', that would be silly, but personally I have used custom .ini files since release and I have so far not run afoul of the Zenimax Overlords.
---
Just make sure that under [Settings] you include the line bItJustWorks=1
---
love guns? love shooting? go pick up every bullet casing and make sure it is accounted for after you fire. 
---
Do these still work? I’m thinking about giving the game another shot. 
---
hey not bad! so we could listen those we like over and over and over and.... whoaaaa i already feel my teammates tears! yummmm! salty!
---
The moment they offed themselves after doing all that really sums up the experience after completing it especially after several times 
---
awesome idea! i wanna put some goul meat in cans for later!
---
I know you used to be able to buy the mod plans from Phoenix, but I made a new char after the plans change and learned it for arms and legs via scrapping. Probably takes 40+ to get one or two mods.
---
I started saving all the 2* and 3* items, in preparation for that legendary vendor...I don't want to drop anything :( 
---
(but yeah i love inventory management)
---
PC? If so I was in on it the last two times (just missed the first)... XP feast for my lowly L35! 
---
true that, is like driving a car you press the gas pedal and bitch becuase it didnt stop. ppl are just playing the game the way it is supposed to be. lol
---
Was still using it into my twenties - loved that gun.
---
While frustrating that it can't be levelled up, it's good to have legendaries that are actually useful for lower levels... 
---
The world of Fallout is incredibly depressing and upsetting. That’s one of the reasons why I really enjoyed all of the NPC’s of the other games. If there’s no one around to save or to help, then what’s the point of doing anything at all?
---
I fully believe that The Survivalist in NV would have blown his brains out if the kids hadn’t shown up. 
---
I've heard if you steal his eggs from point pleasant he will come find you
---
Added you back, must have missed you yesterday.  
---
You still around lv15? Or are you up nearer 20? I'll get a couple of pieces banged together for when we finally get organised!
---
We should be able to record our own songs and trade them with other Wastelanders. 
---
Who wants to hear me scream bloody murder while my character plays the trombone for 4 minutes. 
---
Thanks, I'll try that.
---
Maybe ap regen for 10 mins if the do add it but sprint cost increase for 10 mins
---
That's why I thought at first, but then I wondered if those players were nuking Helvetia to see if it would increase the drop rate of rare masks.
---
Have you maybe, just maybe, hit revenge -&gt; respawn instead of ignore -&gt; respawn?
---
Oh god gunpowder is so heavy
---
dude I hear your rant,
---
but first is my game and I spent ton off hours looking for my stuff so I will use wtf I want. 
---
second point, if im doing daily and group event im not interest in the xp from the enemies I just want to get the event done so I can move to the next one. 
---
3rd point you should know better, you shold be more than aware that ppl are coing to use them so play smart and do what I do most off the time i see ppl using them, get me a 10mm pistol and tag the enemie and let them use their resources. 
---
i get your pain, but f.... that im using my badass weapons. and much love
---
I sell them usually for 100 caps
---
Damn I didn't realize that it was available as an add on now for $20.  That's awesome. 
---
Yeah never heard of or seen that one even in the datamined stuff. Would love to see a image link though if this is some secret legitimate item.
---
Really though it sounds like a troll move or even just a mistake on their part.
---
Did said player by any chance describe the item to you? Any specific details?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b50rhn/turns_out_it_is_possible/ejahfe8
---
I tried, it does extend that far
---
i just farmed mutations with problems while using the perk and the deco shower
---
On PC, probably my nukes. Farmed 6 queens today and waiting for silo cooldown to keep going ;-)
---
I licked a rad toad once.
---
What better ones?
---
I was very surprised as well, tried like 10 times with no luck and yesterday I tried again.  when i got all the keys  to Dome 7 ( all happy that everthing was looking good), get to dome 7 to find it open (was like a shit they are gone) and the plans where there, so I got extra quantum paint plans for sale xbox tho or you can be one off the lucky ones that will find dome 7 open with the plans still there. happy hunting
---
Just searching for a photo of the Ash heap poster as I’ve got all the other ones except that. Any chance you could message me a photo of it? 
---
Yeah I've noticed to get him to do anything you gotta bug him once or twice.
---
Kinda like trying to talk to a drunk guy😉
---
I should have bought it! Kicking myself now, especially every time I see someone with it. 
---
T-60 Blackbird is the best looking armour I've seen in Fallout! 
---
Had this bug with the strange in numbers perk sometimes, seems to be a common problem with this perk.
---
I started a few weeks ago, and because of this, stayed in the forest.  It took me a couple of weeks of play to leave it.  Which if i'm honest, I kind of liked because I therefore had a lot of new stuff to look forward to.  There is plenty in the forest for a couple of weeks of play.  Once your at level 20-25, some of the savage divide is doable if your careful, and the toxic north, even the ash heap once you are 25.  
---
However, some things are just waaay over the top.  Whitesprings is a no go area. I've been there, and thankfully, managed to use the robots for protection.  But I have also died, a lot.  There is also a mutant camp just north which seems to be permanently level 60-70, no matter who is in the area player wise.  
---
I went to the wendigo cave yesterday, I thought it would be doable having watched some youtube vids.  I was level 28 at the time.  When I entered I saw a level 68 ghoul.  I mean, level 60-70 scortched are easy to kill and I like them, but ghouls are mental, and do not stand off from you.  What business did this ghoul have in the cave?
---
Bethesda would make sure that these mounts are not increasing your speed at all but I agree it would be cool. As an atom shop exclusive , a new way to feed them so they trust you or use the charisma perks and instead of defending your camp it’s your new trusty steed 
---
We can also pmcs our weapons and armor too, and for trading we can write 2062’s to other players.
---
The hand scanners are just decorative.
---
I feel you on the bit about the mire. Just got in there, lvl 26 and legit said to myself “I don’t think I’m supposed to be in here yet”. Lol, it could’ve been the game tho. I was heading down the highway and a wendingo randomly spawned, then a horde of scorched, then a scorchbeast AND THEN when I respawned on Freddy’s Halloween shop (near where all of this insanity ensued) I could see a band of mirelurks heading in the direction where all these NPC’s were battling. Fucking nuts. Is that normal? Lol
---
BoS vendor and Enclave have the PA Station for sale.
---
I had the same thing happen about a week ago. He hung around for a couple days before heading off to a nice farm to live out the rest of his days.
---
ah ok that is ok lol 
---
Yeah I always do (I get feedback in the crosshairs), I would try grenades but I feel that might be a dick move for the lower levels...
---
You can find 2 in one of the Frat Houses in the Brewing Quests.
---
There's a Tinfoil hat in there too.
---
I found him in the forest walking from Middle Mountain Cabins towards The Vantage, South - East above Blackwater Mine.
---
depends what are you trying to do? 
---
bloodied, sneak, etc, a weapon that matches your build or the gear you are wearing, will only add to you attributes. thats why i said All Rise is a good all around melee weapon. 
---
for example i do use most off the time the all rise, but if I im low in health/ high on rads im switching to me bloodied weapon, becuase it will be more benefitial for me to use. 
---
Could it be refering to the winter jacket and jeans? From fo4
---
It's really easy and accessible for everyone. 
---
Same perks. And after level 50 you can swap specials around or take a perk card. 
---
Same, got the last recipe I was looking dor today(sausage) was pretty excited about it. 
---
I dont know if id actually believe my eyes if I saw one of those rare ones drop. 3/4 of the masks I wanted were super rare only.
---
Low levels wouldn’t be able to do the event. Also, nuking it does next to nothing. The only thing that changes is that the enemies are buffed. They still will only drop shit loot. 
---
During the journey or only once you make it to your camp? 
---
If you take the animal say at Welch and your camp is at Top of the World but you log off halfway at Flatwoods, is the pet still there when you log back in?
---
Also what happens when you do finally get to your camp, do they just automatically become part of the camp and stroll around or do you have to do something in Build mode to make the animal a part of the camp?
---
exactly. Most of the time i write down a couple names. Mostly some lower lvls or players that just started and came out of the world. 
---
Family reunion 
---
I'm on ps4 and usually see all serums on the market for a solid 200
---
Funny.
---
I just had the weirdest fasnacht experience on xbox.
---
I was running around the town collecting things and doing what had to be done here and there. Then, some players started spamming emotes at me. The salute emote mainly. I kept running around the town trying to find sqirrels and they followed me. I runned south trying to hide in the bushes, they easilly found me and kept spamming emotes.
---
I lost them fast travelling to Helvetia and hiding in the river next to the spawn point. I waited there for the parade to cross the bridge. Then i went south again by the road on the east side of town. Went around houses and hid behind a tree just at the back of the normal sloth spawn point.
---
If it had spawn on the other side like it sometimes happen, i would have missed it. But i was lucky and landed quite a few shots with my 10 mm gun. Nobody even noticed me. I waited a bit for people to go away and then went looting it.
---
I hope not. It said " Limited time only" after all. I hope you guys will get your own awesome paint some day.
---
Same. I 100% can only play with my friends if I want to just dick around or not do anything in particular (they’re all about 2x my level). If I’m questing, I go on mute. 
---
There's at least 3 PA Skins that aren't Atom Shop (Nuka Cola, Quantum, Prototype).
---
And then there's the BoS paints, but not sure if they're PA or Combat Armour.
---
" **The Mistress of Mystery Quest** .... just brilliant! "
---
Oh come on now, that one has to be sarcasm.
---
Lol
---
I've begun leaving lower-level equipment and supplies on the dead survivor (raider?) right outside of Vault 76. Hope someone on Xbox has been fortunate enough to grab some of it... 
---
All correct but damage percentage resist calculates multiplicatively. 5 sentinel doesn’t add up to 75 but multiplies together to about 50 something 
---
Yeah and I get the exclusivity of it. 
---
But I was skeptical about the game because it was early days and off to a pretty rough start and didn't want to spend more actual money on it. 
---
I hope that "limited time only" means there will be another limited time only. 
---
I play every day and don't see that happening. Is that on consoles? Here on PC it is very rare when  someone attacks without any reason. The way you sound in your post it seems that a lot of people try to attack or was it just ONE ? 
---
i just saw someone on ps4 with that mask.
---
first rare mask on anybody's toon in about fifty events
---
If the drop rate is 0.03% for rare masks a mask should drop every 3,333 times the event is done. On a global scale the even has probably been done 100,000's of time and there is no legitimate report of a rare mask drop! To me proof the rare mask drop is bugged and not all all 0,03% as said. My guess is that today and tomorrow (last days of the event) the drop rate will go up dramatically. Bethesda's strategy to ensure grinding to the very end.
---
Basically this but bloodied ain't meta and meta cavalier has been ommited. Bloodied/unyielding is a way to maximise your regular damage output, no doubt, but you pay for it a heavy price of increasing the amount of weapons that can one-shot you drastically when compared to non-bloodied builds, as well as making yourself exceptionally prone to radiation and forcing you to micromanage rads and health.
---
To be precise, there is no best build, think of it more like an advanced rock-paper-shotgun.
---
I'm gonna guess that since we'll still have Bounties in Survival (just working differently), that you'll probably get on for Camp  Wrecking.
---
As for the douche part, you don't want to be one, but "They're asking for it in Survival," really?
---
Blaming others for you own actions is what makes you a douche...
---
I thought of this on a discord group once before I got kicked out for it. 
---
Vault-Chat!
---
Users of the Pip-Boy model 2000 vault 76 version comes with a prototype text based chat. Using the short range transmitters around Appalachia you can keep up with your old friends. 
---
Basically you can see what people are saying locally providing you synced up with a relay tower in the area. You don’t, and you can’t chat. 
---
Just needs a good chat filter and some polish and it’s good to go. 
---
If it’s anything like adventure mode pvp then I’m not interested. I’d rather not get one shotted by a guy jumping 20 feet in the air weilding a deathclaw gauntlet. While also at the same time having 25% health, starving, and dehydrated. Irradiated. 
---
If all that bullshit isn’t included then I’m down. However we all know that’s how it’s going to be.
---
Yeah I’ve noticed increase of pvpers, probably just to bored with being able to one shot everything. I had one follow me back to my camp and attempt to blow it up (rather unsuccessfully) so I payed back the favour 😂 ended up with 600 cap bounty that a let a friend claim 
---
Or atleast give us some Net Ammo for the Harpoongun. 
---
I do know they just provide 100power, not boost production.
---
It’s a waste of time if you ask me and caps. Nothing like following a trend that will become obsolete soon enough. 
---
Too much cookie cutting and not enough creativity. 
---
I have a Bloodied one, on a non-PA build. This thing is ridiculous, ammo economy is the best you can have (250, 350 per core if crafted with high int). On top of that you can produce them for cheap AND the prime version is really worth it with super duper, because it reuses an already crafted core meaning you have 2 chances to proc super duper effect.
---
so if you are lucky, with only one initial craft you can have 4 prime cores, which equals 1500 rounds in my case.
---
Plus you can reduce the weigth of them with battery included.
---
Awesome gun.
---
I feel for you man, Ive got 3 top floor pieces and a set of stairs just hanging around, I cant delete them, I cant move them, and I dont want to have to rebuild my camp all over again, for those of us who really tweak and work our builds its devastating to have this happen.
---
&gt;  This actually feels dangerous.  Like I'm not supposed to be here.
---
Had that feeling when I roamed the Bog at lvl 25 :D 
---
"Oh, I wonder what that green thing in the ground is... oh...there's something crawling out of it... a fucking scorchbeast... I should go..." :D
---
Mini nukes are not that powerful as you may think....
---
I’m getting a weird thing on my PC where I can only place 1 Power Armor chassis and it always has my t-45 set in it. It has tricentennial paint but even if I use any Power Armor chassis without the atom symbol next too it it auto equips all my Armor pieces and stuff. Then when I go to place another chassis, it gets placed but is invisible and only returns to my inventory when I’m either in the other Power-suit or have picked it up.
---
I originally assumed this was intentional so I’ve left it be. But I lost 2 t-45 right legs over it and I’m getting kinda frustrated. Any thoughts?
---
Super excited.
---
The initial phase will have to be harder for new players - if not now, even if they resarted servers, in few months we'd be exactly where we are - people would be sporting great gear and others would be bare handed. Fortunately you can train yourself on adventure and jump into survival when you are ready.
---
F
---
That actually fixes the tiny problem of breaking lore. I mean this is an open world (small) online RPG, it needs some chat and it would be cool for people who want to group up for the new vaults/dlc activities.
---
It would be cool but as places like reddit and discord exist BGS really doesn’t need to add it in. 
---
We can get automated messages all time. The nuke warning, events, so on. So why not a really local one. 
---
Everyone is excited but not for long, some will get killed couple times by stealth snipers then there will be only stealth snipers left and they will never find each other what can be quite boring 😅
---
saw somebody wearing the winter man mask on ps4 about 30 minutes ago.
---
first rare mask I've seen on another player.
---
Wouldn't work. 26 players only in server, that is maybe around 3-4% of total (3000-4000 players) market of traders. So, when it comes to gear, your trading areas becomes totally useless. It makes more sense to everyone start using discord as central trading location.
---
There is a mod someone created on Nexus that supposedly allows for a text chat to work. I’ve not tried it myself, but you could look into it! 
---
mod: [Text Chat [Now With Clans]](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151) 
---
Would be nice, though I wish we could get some DJs for the stations. I don’t mean people either since that is sort of against the game’s concept minus the girl in the top of the world. I mean like having robots DJs that could serve a purpose like letting us know which activities are active.
---
I could so see a Mr Handy in charge of the regular music station letting us know after a song plays that so in so is up or needs work. Just a thought anyhow.
---
How would there be any quality control or anything? Cool idea, seems impossible to implement well. 
---
I've done this event enough times to get everything but the rare masks. I mean everything. Now yes I did luck out and manage to grab some of them from people who kindly dropped them, but for the most part I ended up collecting everything at least 2-3 times if not more.
---
Done it with all bots surviving. Done with only one bot dead. Done it with a mask on. Without a mask on.
---
Nothing seems to trigger the rare drop for me. And I've never seen anyone wearing one in game either.
---
I wouldn't be so bothered by it if the reset time wasn't so long. I spend most of my time server hopping trying to find a server with the event going. I just want to do the event, hop, and do it again. And keep hopping and re-doing it again and again. 
---
I figure the faster I do it, the faster I get a rare right?
---
There is nuka cola paint for power armour
---
So much this!
---
I get a little taken back by the extreme alcohol fixation in the daily challenges lately, and I'm an avid whisky drinker IRL. Even bought barrels at a distillery in Scottland.
---
I also smokes cigars. Let my character smoke a cigar once in a while and let up on the booze.
---
Gotta learn to let some stuff go. 
---
Yeah, I figured. But having 74 fusion cores at ur disposal and 4 different Power Armor sets along with weapon load outs for each one is really handy sometimes :/
---
I want a “Thank You” emote. There’s been a few times where higher levels have saved my ass from difficult mobs and giving them a Thumbs Up or a Heart just doesn’t cover it. Heck, they could just make the ASL sign for “Thank You” be the animation and I’d be set.
---
Talking new T60 not the X01
---
What skin is exactly rare?
---
Is there a way too upgrade stash weight like ur carry weight with strength?
---
Make survival shit again
---
I think there might be a wrongfull notion that Grahm only spawns once per server and then everyone will have to go to the same location to find him? I meet Grahm fairly regularly (maybe Luck influences it? mine is fairly high) and when he shows he seems to almost always spawn directly on top of me, usually just a bit further down a road or somesuch, but if he came walking along a route I would have heard him calling out much sooner than I usually do.
---
Also whenever I see someone posting a route, I usually find him in many other places than just there.
---
So it does affect players, one way or the other. Glad we agree there.
---
As for the rest, I don't really know why you've turned to criticize Bethesda when we are talking about exploiters, but okay. 
---
Thanks but got a couple 
---
Both are true.
---
World chat would be a neat addition. If not for activities then maybe... player trading. This might not be a problem though if Bethesda makes the player vending machines an icon that appears on the map. 
---
Still live world chat would make the other players feel like they actually exist in the world and have a voice and not just an Occasional wave emote.  (Especially for people like me who don’t want to use a mic )
---
There’s your problem. 
---
Storage is fine right now. If anything it would be nice to a food/drink only fridge to keep your crafted Dodd/drink from losing durability when not using it. 
---
People who need t more storage should go back and play NV:Dead Money and really see the life lesson. 
---
No offense to you. 
---
Yeah, that’s fine and thanks for the advice.
---
I’m just lazy. :/
---
I would like kindly remind that any attempts on continuating your agenda after you've been killed are 'inacurrate' :p
---
Agreed with the above comment.
---
It should but it likely won't,
---
Id happily come to a place like that, I think the issue would be though to get people to trust you with the process and not think you'll be stealing their suits.
---
I made a repair shop on my store where the only way in and out is by a switch operated gate, that way the person inside is in charge of who gets in our out.
---
Im glad that they finally started putting up a fight now, dunno when this changed, but initially when I met the flatwoods monster or moth man they would just stand there and take their ass kickings
---
April 9th
---
Same here, and if they are with mic and in there I make sure to explain what I did to get there.
---
Try the building closest to the train yard directly in front of you when you fast travel to Harper's Ferry. There's usually 1-2 plans in the display cases and marine armor is one of the most common spawns. (Be sure to check every display case on every level!)
---
Wow. Someone asking for the Fasnacht Parade to be EVEN MORE casual
---
You have them increase your carry weight, just like the Excavator Power-armor. Also like Power-armor, they return to your bag when spooked! Perks/training allows you to take more hits before dismounting.
---
Give each type of mount a unique bonus, like double the bonus carry-weight for Brahmin, a ROUS granting a warning from burrowing foes. The Mega-sloth giving an AP regen bonus while not moving, and the Deathclaw granting it's stealth-field while not moving, and the Radstag giving a +10 percent speed boost.
---
He already said commie whacker.
---
Lazy writing imo
---
I saw someone with the Jester mask today on PS4. I've done the event dozens and dozens of times and it's the first I've ever seen. I took a photo but not that that really proves anything.
---
https://imgur.com/a/FoJqM08

I've been playing around with the idea when I realised this has already been provided by the creators responsible for the map. There are places that feel certainly empty until you refocus your eyesight onto potential PvP dangers. ALL of the cities in game are worthy and interesting PvP arenas, but the place I recently discovered beats them all and I plan to make my next organised PvP in there. Its called Crannbery Glade, and its like an old park that turned to swamp and detoriated. Its great because its riddled with wooden elevated passageways that run above the swamp area. When in swamp your vision is severely limited but you are obstructed too. When you get onto these passageways you can be seen from much greater distance, and your own perspective is too better. There are also some interesting and tactically viable spots there. 10/10 would PvP.
---
Play it however you like! That's half the fun. I picked up a Furious Chef's Rolling Pin the other day and immediately thought that someone called the Furious Chef would make for a hilarious build. Melee (with the rolling pin), all the food perks, etc.
---
Tried that and it just shows them all in no particular order.
---
I am actually kind of hoping its a visual more in line with the previous games where the foliage and most of the animal life has died out, so the games visuals would be more in line with the previous games, not that Im not enjoying the amazing visuals the enviroment offers now, but because I think they could do amazing things with a more rundown appalachia too. 
---
More survival elements would be cool too, like staying warm or cool, less food and water availability too.
---
I always go with the heart for a thank you, but I like the idea of using the sign for it!
---
thank you!
---
Oh and also, if you're on PS4 hit me up, I always have extra gear.
---
That's why i have herbavore and just make soups, they take care of hunger and thirst, and don't expire
---
Shoot first without them seeing you.
---
I see a fair few problems piping up in survival mode for the pvp side of things.
---
Sadly, even though i like IRL cats so much (and can't have one because i live with an alergic person), i killed cats myself quite a few times in games, even cooked their meat.
---
Getting paid to love it? I wish! I feel like overpayed it to love it, LOL. And I agree, the laziness or the greed went to far with this one. Can't stop playing it tho.
---
use a gamma gun, im more willing to bet he was using BE not TSE at this point in the game
---
on my "Revenge" I hit him first a few times with my Handmade rifle, he stimpacked and thereeee i went haha :-) (i lost 75 caps every time i tried)
---
&gt; those things wreak.
---
Reek.
---
I was sent this by Bethesda support after I reported the same problem, I dont know if any of it works since Ive not tried it myself yet (havent had time) maybe it can help you guys, Ive posted my original message to Bethesda at the bottom.
---
Check In-Game Audio Levels
---
 ----------------------
---
Confirm that the sound levels are set to an audible level:
---
1.From the game's menu, Select Settings, then Audio.
---
2.Ensure the bars are set to the maximum setting.
---
In addition, if you are using headphones, you may wish to try using speakers to see if any sound plays.
---
Check Your Speaker Default Settings
---
You should ensure that your speakers are correctly configured:
---
1.Right-click the speaker icon on your Windows desktop and select Playbackdevices.
---
2.Select the speakers or headphones that you use and right-click each one of the devices and select Disable.
---
3.Right-click the one you wish to use and select Enable.
---
4.Select the device you wish to use and click Properties.
---
5.Click the Advanced tab and change the Default format to 16bit 48000 Hz (DVD Quality).
---
6.Click on the green triangle Test button to verify the sound is working.
---
7.Click Apply and then OK.
---
Once complete, start the game up while leaving the sound window open on the Playback tab. This will allow you to see whether or not the game's audio is being received (the bars will move).
---
Disconnect Additional Peripheral Devices
---
Your sound settings can be altered by additional peripherals. Disconnect any peripheral devices that are not necessary, such as a phone or camera.
---
Close Other Programs Running in the Background
---
In some cases, other programs running in the background may interfere with Fallout 76. You can close any unnecessary programs by following the process below:
---
1.Right-click the taskbar and select Start Task Manager.
---
2.Click the Applications tab to see a list of all the programs that are currently running on your computer and each program's status (either Running or Not Responding).
---
3.Close any unnecessary programs and processes that are running while playing Fallout 76.
---
Update Sound Card Drivers
---
To check to ensure your audio drivers are up to date:
---
1.Open the Device Manager (note that you may require administrator permissions for access). To do so:
---
1.Click Start and select ControlPanel
---
2.Select System and Security and select Device Manager under System.
---
2.In the list of hardware categories, navigate to Sound, video and game controllers.
---
3.Right click on the audio device you wish to update.
---
4.Select Update Driver and follow the instructions.
---
◦
---
Update or Reinstall DirectX
---
 In some cases, reinstalling DirectX has resolved some sound issues. You can find instructions on reinstalling DirectX here. I hope this information was helpful. If not, please feel free to reach back out to us, so that we can offer further assistance. Thank you for your continued support!

Warm Regards,

"Hello Support, 
---
I have an issue thats been bothering me since launch, Its relatively minor, but it saddens me that I cant find a way to fix it, since it would really enhance my experience with the game; 
---
My microphone isnt working in game, and neither can I hear other players when they speak, my wife and I both use discord instead, I can see others chat icons light up when they speak, 
---
as well as they can see mine light up, Ive set my chat to area since launch to hear everyone and let everyone hear me, when the game automatically switches to team I set it back to area as 
---
well, Ive tried looking up fixes online for it with no luck as it just doesnt seem to be that much of an issue for others? I would really like to be able to interact with people I meet and make new friends 
---
and I hope you can help me with this. "
---
Ah yes :P They were "quite" alive if i can say that ....
---
It was a rifle and made this distinct sound and bright yellow flash when it hit me (those i always see people running around with at the Greenbriar resort!)
---
I guess no such armor protects me from this stuff?
---
Just so you know, eating honey right before using jet pack seems to give you like 10 times as much jetpack fuel. Can't sprint before jumping though, that seems to use too many AP.
---
Classical is seriously underrated. Nothing like walking through the forest with lights shining through the foilage while listening to Classical 👌
---
I like to sneak into other people's camps and turn on all their appliances, especially the decontamination arch if they have one.
---
It'll cost them loads of caps in energy and water bills, I'm sure.
---
Now if only BGS would add working sinks...I could do my Wet Bandits RP.
---
i fucking love killing wanted players at their camp,
---
nothing bring me joy in this game more than blasting of the door and then unloading my entire magazine on someone.
---
wtf.gif
---
Try Flatwoods, near the church, there's an armour bench. 
---
2 plans spawn there, usually Metal Armour/Mods
---
Tse can be countered with fireproof perk and dense chest mod 
---
Taking notes here! Thanks!!!
---
Ill let ya in on a secret...
---
Presidential Suite has a bed ;) unfortunatly for now youll need to use the powerarmor glitch to get in but hey still worth it imo
---
dense armor and fireproof would pretty much nullify the explosive damage.
---
samething I said, shit I paid 60 buck im playing the damn game lol 
---
They're allergic.
---
amen
---
Far east eh? xD depends on you defences and level... Far east = gulpers, super mutants with miniguns and deathclaws from chameleon to mythic, sooo yeah xD 
---
And yesterday i was kinda proud to be on top of the WS main building. Doh!
---
That’s either a careless exaggeration or you should really change up the way you play. You are basically punishing yourself. 
---
Inventory management is not hard once you accept that you are not meant to have everything. 2-4 weapons depending on your perks. A reasonable set of armour, considering not only it’s damage reduction, but its weight as well. Aid items can get crazy pretty fast, but there are a lot of weight reduction perks for them, and it’s pretty viable to not carry food instead finding it along in your travels.
---
So annoying to switch between my anti armor and troubleshooter pitchfork
---
I desperately wanted a kitchen stove that would be both functional and that I wouldn't be afraid to cook on.
---
The broken doors certainly prevent me from the purchase.
---
Ghoulslayer Gamma Guns are not just myths.
---
Yes I was hoping to get the plan's for it as a reward for the nukashine quest but was extremely disappointed when I didn't
---
If people leave their workbenches near windows you can use them through the other side and the game teleports you into the room. I think Bethesda should patch this, it's fun for getting inside people's homes when they've locked the door but it's pretty daft really.
---
Also to everyone who locks their doors, you know you can lock windows aswell don't you? And terminals, and weirdly portable toilets and nuka machines can be locked too.
---
This game is more like Diablo bro.... kill monsters to get mats and weapons to kill stronger monsters, farm more mats kill stronger monsters to be able to kill even stronger monsters....
---
So yeah ....if u are solo make your own adventure...play stealth sniper build to add more flavour
---
Never broken. Just rare. I have seen people with the masks (goblin, sun, jester). I am not sure what the true drop rate is or whether or not there are mechanics to increase the rate. However, the current drop rate for other rare items is 0.03 percent, so it is a understandable that people that have only played 100 events haven't seen it. 
---
Play the game ☻
---
No srsly though stick with the missions,finishing them all should get you to 45 - 50
---
lol sure
---
Probably unpopular opinion but..  
---
I want it as much as you, but I want it in a big nuka cola themed DLC, like nuka world in fo4. Bring back all the nuka stuff from fo4, it has so much in the Nuka cola collector workshop!
---
Because the only BOS mod that can be learned by scrapping is the Paint option for the Combat Armor Helmet. 
---
BOS mod for Chest, Leg, and Arm cannot be learned by scrapping.  This has been confirmed by dataminers and numerous testers.  Every person that says they did actually mistook the BOS helmet paint message as a BOS mod. 
---
1. power armor stays in your inventory ...dont rly need to keep more than x-01
---
2. No weapons in chest
---
3. no meds
---
4. Chest is only for mats...and ofc make them in BULKS! so they take less space...
---
Nvm 
---
Oh thank you so much! I'm definitely blind. I've been there dozens of times and I've never seen it.
---
It was a really dumb thread, but you saved my life.
---
You exp you go nomadic, you grew in power its finally reasonable to go static. I was 100% nomadic to level 60. I was ignoring the area level in my adventures, I was often fighting level 40+ stuffs when level 15, and each time I seen a deathclaw I just shat my camp underneath myself as first reaction, then cheesed the beast around while turrets dealt with it. Since I was 170, which was three months ago, I have had all my camps within two nuke-diameters of Whitesprings so I consider myself static now.
---
I pretty much made my way to ash heap almost immediately, found a pump shotgun and some power armor and I was pretty much set. Eventually found the excavation PA plans and that made my compulsive looting semi easier. Also until you have a C.A.M.P with a power armor station, use the one in white springs (again this may differ from your play style, this is just what I did)   
---
Do bulls auto convert when crafting or do I need to take my time to re scrap them?
---
God no....dont u have enough trolls and haters that u want to hear them in game too?
---
Or imagine a Chinese bots selling caps or legendary weapons ... god forbids 
---
One good deeds breeds many more
---
I always fear that leaving bag on ground will be useless as the chances someone will come over there before it despawn are really low.
---
Player vending can't come soon enough. I don't know how it will work. People are hoping we can set prices. But if we can, il will often set them at the lowest possible amount. Or, maybe not. I mean, i would but then i fear people would buy everything so they can sell it at higher price...
---
They use to be monkeys living a top of this tree with cars...so yeh they want to have fun if u wander there carelessly 
---
Indeed it does
---
Doesn’t work.  
---
That's what he said.
---
Best bit of lore in FO76 -- the raiders are all rich bastards who were on skiing holidays, not the gang bangers everyone would have assumed they were.
---
Yes bulks auto convert if u auto them.... and u lose all this plastic u used (well maybe not all i guess but a lot!) so never auto scrap if u have bulks in inventory!
---
You can't have waited that long. If you just sat on a server that the event wasn't running on it would start up in 20-40 minutes depending on how long the previous run took.
---
Only people still grinding the event are optimists
---
Ok
---
You mean like the one that we found in the frat house? The one that spins?
---
Might I recommend [SCUM](https://scumgame.com/en) ? You get to poop, piss, vomit, AND have an adjustable dick length! 
---
There is BOS PA paint you can get from delivering tech datq
---
You can add me sir. Im a bit higher than u but my team is around your level. We offer help with anything, quests, hunts, power leveling..u can use my psn For\_Nurgle and join anytime im online
---
I've said the same thing it's a great idea. Turn in the common for a rare one something like 50 commons so people who actually have farmed could get it. 
---
Cool 👍
---
I don't know why you feel the need to hatefully spam insults at people in order to inflate you ego. This posts always get down voted to oblivion before I am able to catch it. What is it you have to offer to the subject that is truly insightful or productive?
---
Even ManicKnight's comment got downvoted and for what? Wishing somebody the best of luck?
---
You are right though.. we are talking about exploiters, but you seemed to ignore the rest of what I had to say in order for it to play up your own devices.  Have you ever considered it's also on them for poorly handling it on top of other ridiculous erroneous decisions they made?
---
Considering how you act, the rest of what you say just sounds someone hiding behind a flag to justify their repulsive attitude. 
---
Dont exactly remember what was it about but u can add me psn For\_Nurgle ...will help in a sec
---
That's why you should put pacifist mode on before starting the event (or going to a nuke zone, or, frankly, just all the time, unless you're explicitly going for PvP).
---
Yeah, ^•ﻌ•^ there's ways they could make these obtainable for those players while keeping these masks as rare as they want the masks to be. Turn in system is one of them.
---
I’m on PC and yesterday I was kicked at one point three times in the first hour, and then several more during a couple of different play sessions during the day. 
---
I was feeling much more lag too, my base renders in extremely slowly, in every world I spawn into.
---
Awesome, also designated areas for the camps? Makes sense, we can only respawn at our camps, train stations and Vault 76. Would be beneficial to have camps in specific areas to get around quicker. 
---
Workshops are pretty useless. You can farm dozens of cores at The Whitesprings, Junk is everywhere.. The plans are low level. It can be a good source of caps. 
---
Radium rifles, spec'd up they dominate, if you can get a decent legendary one you'll be laughing 
---
Woah, what mask is that ? Awesome outfit btw !
---
it's the final brotherhood quest so it'd be easier with a couple more people maybe? i'll wait to see if anyone is free
---
xD lol i can solo everything atm ..so up to u...
---
i had the same problem, when I absolutly have too I would just drop it in chest or desk something, it will still disapear if you leave the server but it takes longer.
---
And yet you are on its Reddit page
---
Yes yes... I believe a campaign is in order! Very well then, there is a Enclave discord server you could join my friend. 
---
In other words Glass Cave...just jump to the game and i will take you thru in no time bro There is lvl 80 scorchbeast at the end so dont let it eat u 
---
Yeah I don’t see duct tape anymore I see adhesive 🤣
---
I think this issue is universal. I’ve been wondering what happens when you stand in a position where a floor is going to render. Will you be stuck?
---
I just did one where the robot with the witch mask died and I got the witch mask as a reward. Maybe a robot with a rare mask has to die? 
---
I’ve been wandering into new fissure sites lately.  If you were really South of vault 96, you may have hit one that I saw recently.  
---
I also hit one in the forest near the bottom of the lift for Top of the World.
---
Ffs............just eat the little fucker and take a big spoonful of man up..welcome to the apocalypse baby.
---
They dropped better loot than non-nuked helvetia when someone nuked minutes before the event started on a server I was on a few nights ago. It was 2 am and no low levels showed up, one guy was able to play for the musician but nothing else we had was difficult.
---
But it is an important part of your daily diet. My grandpappy ate a spoonful with his cereal every day. Lived till he was 98. Had 6 children, 14 grand children, 33 great grand children and left a 10 foot hole at the creamatorium.
---
Outside Harper's Ferry there's a spot which spawns 2 or 3 regularly for me
---
1250 outfits? I personnally only use one; my blue "nurse" outfit. I like blue.
---
I guess I'm playing this game again...
---
Well, you do have the option of **not** doing what she asked, like I did. At the end of the day, even in the previous Fallouts most things boiled down to "Go here and do this because I say so" or... don't. It hasn't made a difference to me whether I get those instructions from a single line of text on a piece of paper, a long dead voice from a holotape or a 'real' human NPC with five repeating lines of dialogue.
---
There is also miner spawns in mines near whitespring and the cranberry bog 
---
Screws are the real currency of the apocalypse.
---
Unless they fix several broken builds pvp will only be for the people with these build. Regular players stand no chance against these builds.
---
I always immediately leave this event after I’m done it’s ridiculous the high levels with there TSE and overpowers weapons shooting every one after the event and during trying to pvp kill lower levels is cancer I can’t wait for that PVP mode get the hell out of survival mode 
---
Good on you for trying haha!
---
Says tomorrow on the roadmap. And probably the same time as all the other Tuesday updates. It starts at around 9-10am est and takes a few hours.
---
i dont know what your talking about the last 15 times I have done the event that mofo has frozen, i dont even bother with him anymore, I would take the wolf meat better.
---
hi, if you got the game, go into the pipboy, on status, special window, then scroll each special, you will see a brief description of what they affect, like for example intelligence affecting the condition of new items you create, strength affecting mac carry weight, and so on
---
Thank you for sharing this! Being a good samaritan is one of the best end game events you can do. It doesn't reward you with ingame items - But it grants a smile to so many. Just like your story.
---
Thank you for our first evidence backed highest level sighting!
---
You have been credited on the board for your work.
---
i want everything in that room!!!!!!
---
I’m so glad to have helped you smile. Hopefully I can make more people smile one day when I help them.
---
Ah man now you  made me go and dig out my audio books of it again there goes my next 6 weeks of planned listening gone out the window :P 
---
Please, show me where I have "spammed insults". I will wait. This has nothing to do with ego, I'm simply pointing out the obvious.
---
Look, I understand that you make things up to prove a (wrong) point - but it clearly isn't working. So stop embarrassing yourself, please.
---
Oh, so the problem here is that you don't like downvotes. Welcome to Reddit, pal. This is how it works - if people disagree with someone, they will downvote, that is why said feature exists.
---
I have ignored that part because it doesn't have anything to do with what is being discusses. It's a bit hypocritical that you can ignore my arguments and go on a tangent and then criticize *me* for trying to reconduct the discussion to where it belongs. 
---
It is partly on them, just the same as it is partly on the guy who leaves his wallet on the bus and it gets stolen. But guess who gets punished? *The thief*.
---
Could you imagine how much more scary and threatening the robots would be if they didn't talk at all?
---
They would be cold and soulless machines, programmed to kill -  relentless, callous, without compassion or fear, lacking any traces of emotion, impervious to anything deviating from their original programming. They'd pursue a perceived threat without uttering a single sound, but with deadly efficiency.
---
The ultimate horror! And it gets to show how war ultimately bereaves humans of their humanity.
---
But - God forbid! - the franchise's downward spiral into utter silliness mustn't be stopped!!
---
Damn I guess that’s an encounter. Because I’ve fought three wendigos in that exact same spit 2 times now
---
Same here mate, add Zharkul, i mostly play solo, hit we are 4ppl that usualy stick together, feel free to join and team up anytime im online if you need help or anything you wanna do 🤘
---
Will do👍
---
Since the last patch hit it has been a mixed bag of tricks for me:
---
\- 'Punch lag' (not sure how else to call it): Repeatedly mising 'punches' on mobs that are right there in front of me because well, even though the games renders them 'there' they are actually 'elsewhere' or they are just not getting the memo that they are being punched.
---
\- Getting rads for no reason until seconds later a glowing enemy of some description manifests out of nowhere.
---
\- Getting diseases out of nowhere. I have a few times developed Rad Worms and Glowing Pustules because. While standing on my CAMP. Alone. Minutes after the last encounter. To make it more fun they don't show on the PipBoy, if I miss the warning message I am just left wondering what is going on.
---
\- Bring up the radial menu to change weapon, eat, drink, heal... crash.
---
\- Daily quests (the ones in Camden being the most egregious; this outfit is taking long enough to acquire, doesn't need further delaying tactics) not triggering no matter what combination of eldritch techniques I employ.
---
\- Random server-wide disconnects.
---
\- General unresponsiveness interacting with world containers.
---
\- Partially rendered locations.
---
It has been steadily getting worse too. The weekend was - unsurprisingly - particularly 'fun' in this regard.
---
I did consider for a second that it could be my PC or connection but I can reproduce the behaviour two completely different PCs that are located in different countries altogether so I am going to go for 'not impossible but definitely less likely to be the case'.
---
I have a pretty high end rig and I have been having a long freeze/wait when loading the game.
---
It slowly tells me the radio signals I have, then any bonus effects I have (*well rested, etc*), then it will tell me "Checkpointed" a few times before I am able to move.  All in all, it takes me about a minute and a half before I can do anything after the game loads.
---
This is a new development after the last update.
---
The new BoS skin and the Nuka Quantum skins are pretty rare ATM
---
I bought Fallout 76 about 3 days ago after being turned off by all the reviews way back and had the chance to get it real cheap and was just on my way to the in game airport till i noticed a bunch of people gathered at this little town. So i checked it out, got a quest for an event, checked that out. Didn't know what the hell to do so just went looking for robots and eggs. Went on to do the march, got freaked out because of those giant toads that i had never seen before in previous games, shot some suicidal supermutants and confronted an legendary enemy before realizing my new lv 100 ish friends already killed it. Then got a request to trade, me telling the guy i had nothing to give him except some duplicate weapons that no way in hell mr power armor would use. So he cancelled, dropped 3 other festival mask's, gave a heart and left the server.
---
I mean, if this is how the community and game is, i regret not getting it sooner lol.
---
Also, feel free to add my psn if you feel like playing because i have nobody in my friendlist currently on this game and would love to explore together. Just hit me a DM. :)
---
The frustration comes with being given access back and then having it removed. All without any word from Bethesda. We just want to know what is going on. It's been a month of being left in the dark. 
---
I showed as much proof as possible to show I was wrongfully suspended. That their system was flawed. But they just don't seem to care. Im not going to post much here anymore. I'm sure as hell done with making guides or giving advice. 
---
I've played wow since 2006. LoL from 2011-2016. Hearthstone since open beta. I've never been suspended from a game in my life. This is fucking shit. 
---
I have a +50 limb damage gatling. I guess wings aren't limbs as it rarely forces them to land. 
---
Can this game actually get anymore casual friendly ? 
---
Fixed that for you :D  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Q2wNnFw](https://imgur.com/a/Q2wNnFw)
---
And then, like most game companies, they will nerf every weapon so people can survive longer in PVP while making PVE all the more difficult.
---
Maybe we have bad memory loss lol. I agree tho it is annoying.
---
Behemothman.
---
pirate mask? 
---
Caps.
---
Seriously though, to people or to vendors?
---
If you want to sell to players, try /r/fo76marketplace

Hey there! Can you file a ticket for this so we can investigate?

I've been carrying a Bloody Dragon on my unarmed character. I swear the SB land less now. 
---
I recall if I hid behind a tree the SB tended to land but not anymore. Oh well, they're not hard to kill.
---
Yeah there's a spawner nearby for medium level glowing enemies. I fought two Mirelurk Deep Kings and three Glowing Mirelurk Hunters in that spot the other night. Wendigos are ok lol
---
Yes, I meant the resort exit, which was pretty clear given every other descriptor. But, nice catch? 
---
WYM "only 100" how many do I have to do to get one mask that is seasonal. Am I supposed to sit on the game all day and grind and grind? How many should I play? Another 400 or what do you think is best
---
As I learned to my horror when I noticed I had a lot of useless cloth and had the genius idea of turning it all into gunpowder...
---
By the way, since the recipe for *gunpowder* is cloth+acid it's really guncotton -- aka cordite, nitrocelulose.
---
Explore. Find places to loot stuff, you use. Don't horde things you don't use. Takeover workshops for building plans. (This does put you in PVP) Don't get discouraged by douches, just server hop. Have a great time and maybe meet people.
---
You will still get a bounty and lose actual caps and aid items when people come to kill you. If you destroy my camp all I have to do is press a button and it all repairs itself. I have a ton of junk. Doesn’t bother me. 
---
Survival mode won't let you stack stimpacks from what I've read. It won't solve the getting 1 shot problem but I guess it's a start.
---
Quantum and Nuka Cola paint  for PA are available in game
---
They will only nerf  them when the big YouTubers complain about it.
---
This. The first time in the Mire, it's night, and I'm level 32ish trying to reach "that bunker". Using VATs to see what's ahead: Mirelurk Queen and 3 other Mirelurks like Bloodrage. NOPE.
---
Making up things eh? Nothing I had to say was false, but okay. I think it's time I move on while you continue to have a discussion with yourself.
---
IF the drop rate is 0.03% then running the event 100 times gives you a roughly 3% chance of having gotten 1 rare mask.
---
I think the idea is that the masks are rare and basically not grindable at the current drop rate.
---
I fast traveled last night and didn’t get anything. My team mate joined and I followed for free but didn’t get anything from the event. It was in an uncovered area of the map. 
---
Nice psn name, I'm more of a tzeentch fan myself 
---
Ass aultrons.
---
That all sounds relatable. A word from fallout on this subject would be nice, even if it’s just an acknowledgement.
---
But violence is fine tho i don't care if the cool dudes in video games/ film resolve everything with violence and thus make it seem like it can always be used to "fix" things.
---

Caps and to players
---
I would laugh if they released it 10 minutes before server shutdown for the maintenance.
---
&gt; protect the root 
---
Route.
---
Unless you're getting into some cultist shit.
---
Maybe you need to take a break or start a new character 
---
When I hop servers looking for the event I usually also hunt for other encounters. I will set up shop in Charleston and hunt for the rare vendor bot. This gives me something to do on each server while I look for a live event.
---
Can always fast travel (using camp icon).
---
And u propably have an idea what armor paint im waiting :3 ...EHh sooon. Wanna guess which mutation was my first? 100% legit ;P
---
One can if one has an Auto Grenade Launcher, dear chap.
---
Wasn't there a part where you could more easily get past place by smoking? To be able to see some lasers and you could avoid them rather than having to go find out how to shut them down or something?
---
God...no, too expensive..
---
And my karma
---
I want 4.
---
To line them up in a row.
---
Three will have deadly traps, one will lead to a crafting room.
---
thats what i have been saying, just play the game and dont let youtube or reddit make the judgment for you. rock on and keep enjoying the game, I know i do.

Bethesda should add hanging tools in game and animation. And we should make public hanging for you.
---
I have a 3\* AA gatling gun but the catch is it is only level 30 odds so does 40-ish damage with long barrel, extended mag and speedy repeater. The legendary effects are:
---
AA - ignores 50% armour, 25% increased rate of fire and a 90% weight reduction.

The increased RPM means it fires 25% faster so that's around 600rpm. It rips through ammo but I also have a regular level 50 gat which does 86 damage iirc and also has the same attachments. Apart from it being extremely light (0.36lbs with all weight perks maxed out and heavy guns perks, I'm a heavy gunner) it performs almost the same as the regular lvl 50 gat. Obviously if it was a level 50 three star with the same effects it would be superior but lets not forget about level. We see a three star and automatically think" JACKPOT!" but sometimes meh...
---
Interesting idea but one adjustment, there should be base vanilla damage regardless of "charges". And another part of "charges" damage. It's a pretty common thing - look at TESO weapon charges.
---
It's not a bad idea and can certainly bring in a degree of balance to melee weapons. But dont say that because the "noooo my 500 dmg sledge hanmer is already 'garbage' " crew are gonna rip your throat. 
---
You don't loose perk card points. You can easily use them
---
I hope to be able to play 25+hr download time. Got crappy internet! 
---
Similar amount of hours and experience here. I tend to feel there are some details missing when I read these stories. I'm curious how many people saying their base keeps getting wrecked are at Whitespring or Charleston station.
---
Thanks for reminding me!!
---
I also spent hours farming materials to craft and scrap combat armour to no avail. I’m pretty sure if you look at my reddit history, you can see I’ve spent thousands of caps on leather, steel, plastic and whatever else needed to make the armour which I then scrapped without any success lol 
---
And I had super duper and scrapper perks allocated to maximize components and time. 
---
I have crafted/scrapped hundreds of level 15 arms, legs, chest pieces.
---
The point of the post was to shed light on the fact that we 
---
1. Need more content or events that will reward these rare plans/weapons/armour
---
2. Change the percentage of rare drops 
---
3. Make them vendor available again (which I don’t personally like, I think it’s good to keep them rare which I turn, they need to be earned &amp; limits server hopping)
---
4. Make a perk system or card we can get to increase drops
---
5. Have Luck affect your drops (Higher the stat, better the drops)
---
Or maybe I’m just whining and complaining because I’m bored. 
---
But Nobody wants to fight the queen anymore and I don’t think I can stand another session of farming Whitespring’s for XP and 1 star legendaries lol
---
If someone has a crafting bench, chair or a bed near a window, (inside their camp). You can get in very easily by activating the object from outside the window.
---
It teleports your player through the wall straight to the object... and YOU'RE IN :)
---
Well yeah getting out isn’t the issue. I just thought it would be funny to be caught in the floor “mould” so to speak/
---
I tend to think a lot of these guys are trying to get their last hits in before they get their asses handed to them on Tuesday in survival mode lol
---
I'll blame my phone on that one.
---
There should be a popup appearing when your workshop is contested in adventure. It should contain three buttons: accept, pass, accept and wait.
---
Accept should ignore FT blockades and Fast Travel you nearby your workshop even if you have damn radrats nearby. Pass should give them ownership without initiating PvP. Accept and wait should open you to PvP but not transport you to workshop automatically (to let you drop junk etc).
---
This will not be an issue on survival servers.
---
It's been doing that from the start.
---
It was. If not, you would have already quoted my supposed insults.
---
Thanks for your participation. Try harder next time.
---
I agree, that its unpopular because I don't like that opinion. Nukaworld immediately loses its value when there's a recreation or two of them.
---
Leave fo4 alone!
---
Yep. While I agree that chat is useful, you can look at the other 3 billions mmos out there, the cancer way surpasses  the usefulness of the chat function. And oh god, especially for this game that already has hate bandwagon waiting for every tiny opportunity to bite Bethesda.
---
Now, that being said. I am totally supporting the idea of "limited" chat function. For example, your chat can only go as far as your voice chat proximity. Private message via pip-boy to only mutually added friends. Mail via pip-boy/cargo bot with hefty cooldown (5-10 mins). 
---
Lol I hate when people even come near my camp I get so paranoid, but I do like to adventure and try to trade/mess with other peoples camps too, and I’ve been trapped by someone building walls around me in their camp too xD it’s a love hate thing I guess 
---
Never played that game, but is it like Skyrim where once the weapon runs out of charge it can be used with less effect? Until it's charged with another soul gem?
---
Because that would be the best solution I agree. There would be  nothing stopping you use all these weapons as standard bashing weapons while unfueld.
---
But as this mechanic is not in the game I think it simply needing the fuel as part of the repair cost would work for now.
---
Yeah it happens all the time. The cases in which a legendary mob won't drop any legendary items are actually really rare. If there's no drill or no syringer always check the body later on. There's a high chance the item is now in the inventory.
---
For sitting? My character seems to use it as a drinking object... dammit
---
All I’m gonna say is “16 X the detail” I’ve had this too with the sloth in Helvetia he dropped a baton and then a 1* anti armour sledge hammer
---
Start each day at your camp.  Repair armor &amp; weapons,  cook food.  Then,  pick a goal.  So you just need junk?  Go exploring!  Or, work on the quest lines. If you are out of ideas,  hop the events to help you explore the map.  Events give caps,  random scrappable loot, and plans. But they also drop xp, so they are worth it. 
---
After doing "everything" on the map,  I'm using the challenges to drive my goals when I play.  
---
I'm very neurotic with cleaning up my inventory. It bugs me constantly if i see my carry weight exceeding the usual minimum. 
---
A useful illness, I guess lol
---
Good shout. I remember that now!
---
But even that can be circumvented if they shove those valuables to their teambuddys first, right ?
---
I did the same thing a few days ago when I saw a Desk Fan.  
---
I need screws!!!!!!
---
In game effects do not alter perk card points positively or negatively.
---
I've found all these materials to be reasonably common, it's not like I've suggested 3x pure cobalt flux!
---
This broke my heart, especially the cotton yarn.
---
Screw you bethesda.
---
If you break into someones camp, can you actually steal anything? Can you access someone stash for example? 
---
I really need to try and play this morning, I like where the game is headed and what players have been doing with it. 
---
I’m guessing a day tripper in the game is like a mixture of pot and shrooms.
---
The person I play with and I gave up, because we seem to be stuck in a bug where our stash is permanently full. We tried taking just about everything out and scrapped/sold a ton of things, but it didn't fix it. 
---
It will matter in a few days or hours. The experience will be different. 
---
MODUS, myself and the other officers are having a hard time grasping this too.
---
Your phone is getting into cultist shit?  I'd look out if I were you.  Next thing you know you're going to find creepy statues made out of bone in your bedroom.
---
 I've done the mission twice.  Once because a guy I was trading with happened to be in it when I showed up. It's a boring mission and by the sounds of it I'm glad I didn't try to grind one of those ridiculous mardi gras masks. Like anyone in a post apocalyptic setting is going to wear that kind of shit. 
---
&gt;Thank you soo much, really helpful ;-)  
---
&gt;I will take a look tonight after work and will let you know !
---
Both variants of the leather coat (traveling has a backpack) drop from doing dailies/events in The Mire. From what I've heard however, it has a 0.03% of dropping either variant. I tried to get one to drop for way too long, ended up buying both leather coat variants instead :)
---
Agree. Crash landing should be an actual mechanic to fight them. Way more fun. 
---
Totally did, i was getting aoto Alt-Tabbed out of the game screen to my desktop, VERY annoying whilst drying to do literally anything!
---
It's also potential exploit: be a sniper, contest workshop, step in, shoot, step out to get safe, step in, shoot, step out to get safe, repeat.
---
The only way to circumvent that is to lock fight in circle and force defeat (giving up workshop) if you step out of the area. 
---
This right here. I'm level 116 played from launch but ended up taking a 2 month break and only recently started playing again in the last week or so. Ice had days where I've just decided to wonder around areas and I'm astounded by the number of places I find in areas I thought I'd already been.
---
Well, that's still cool. First time I've seen a pic of someone wearing it.
---
Right on thanks. Sometimes I stay up at night wondering what loot remains behind the infinite loading glitch
---
Yep I ran around with a machete lol but Id like to go heavy weapons and power armor, dont know if I messed it up with the perks now.
---
Thanks for the offer!
---
Same. I'll believe that they are out there when I see I with my own eyes otherwise the drop rate is bull. If someone does over 100 rounds they should have one. 
---
It's in all the recent elder scroll games with pretty much the same engine this game is based on. It's totally feasible. 
---
Tbh I think the period should be like 7 seconds or the perk is useless without automatic weapons.
---
But the games not buggy.  Ive never experienced one single bug.  I don't understand when people say it's buggy.
---
- every deluded Fo76 player
---
The hat/helm question:
---
Bethesda didn't want to force anyone to actually use them so that you could make your character face look like whatever you wanted without losing on stats.
---
Yup! Let's do it!
---
Right of the crashed space station on the map there's a shack I built my camp in since the first week of the beta. I built it cause it looked cool and I loved the view but I later found out that it spawns lots of good junk, like ballistic fiber from military duct tape, hallucinogen canister, and a cap stash on the roof. I later found out there's two black titanium nodes below the ridge behind the shack which are super useful for repairing my excavator.
---
Lost my spot there like a day before the update where they stopped your camp disappearing but I built next door where a lead deposit is.
---
3000 times give you the closest chance to get **1**. Dunno how your going to have time to get in the last 12,000 times for the others by tomorrow though.
---
There are too many BS ways to one shot kill people, which isnt fun gameplay at all. The only ones whom like that for months on end are trolls.  
---
The fact that PvP is how it is in FO76 atm, is baffling. Just one look at the stats and perks one can get and they should have seen issues with PvP coming from miles away.  
---
But it is what it is, I dont ever see PvP working. Its just a one shot perk abusing shitfest.
---
The following are found in game:
---
T51b nuka cola
---
X01 nuka cola quantum
---
T60 BOS initiate (reports that this is now removed)
---
T60 BOS knight
---
T60 BOS knight Captain
---
T60 BOS knight Seargant
---
T60 BOS officer
---
T60 BOS Paladin
---
T60 BOS Elder
---
I was having the same problem myself on PC.
---
I tried a number of things that other fellow players reported it 'fixed' the issue for them - walk to rather than FT, wander around area X etc - but no dice.
---
As a last ditch attempt I tried to start a daily quest that I had never before triggered on this 'toon', in this particular case the one in the Giant Teapot where the friendly Mr Handy  sends you to fetch honey for his brew.
---
I did this Saturday afternoon and Sunday evening the dailies - including this last one - started triggering again after a four day dry spell.
---
However we know that correlation =/= causation so I have no idea if the two are related or the dailies would have 'restarted' regardless. Said that if you have a daily quest you have never done before I would give it a go myself, as far as I can tell you have nothing to lose?
---
Here is hoping that tonight I will be able to trigger them again but hey, who knows. 
---
I sit mostly on the roof of the pickup, which is opposite the post office. Wait until the sloth shows up, mark it, change to my Tesla and finish the dogs.
---
But it is really crazy how everyone jumps exclusively on the sloth.
---
Maybe a second legendary creature coming from the other direction would have made sense
---
yeah yesterday was crazy I had like 3 or 4 server disconnects, 2 game crashes and at one point i looked like I was getting 5 fps at the nuke zone, im on xbox.
---
might have been ppl just server hopping for the event. but I hope it gets better
---
Ye its a random cryptid, sometimes it's that, or the mothman or the flatwoods monster. It's a bugged daily quest tho, there is no way to know what triggers it or the trigger that should make it happen is bugged, idk. I have close to 500 hours as well but only was able to do that quest 3x. Good luck.
---
Bro you gotta say what system you play on, if you’re Xbox I have a bloodied explosive assault rifle. Want to trade for a 3 star heavy weapon. DM me
---
(you forgot the 😎 emoji at the end)
---
That's a good idea tbh. When someone is trying to take your workshop, the system UI should tell us and let us decide what to do. 
---
DEFEND means you'll be teleported to your workshop and lock you inside the workshop ring until one person fill the claim bar.
---
GIVE UP = just let the other person take it.
---
Anytime you die in the workshop you'll get another question whether you want to continue defend your workshop (spawn inside the workshop outer ring) or give up (spawn outside the workshop circle ring)
---
Make it into a soup!
---
Ah! The totem climb?
---
Cool thanks, appreciate it!
---
I’m really sorry I’m laughing 
---
And increase her melee damage a bit?  
---
Kinda dumb that a deathclaw can one shot me (out of my sent armor at least) and i can take a ridiculous amount of hits from her, basically unscathed. At worst she breaks a limb. OH NOES!   
---
I wanna see her land **ON** someone and kill them, when she gets shot down. I want ragdoll corpses flying off into the distance **every** time she swings. I want piles of dead wastelander bodies. I want to hide from her in the vast mountains of dead. Full on rotting body landslide style.  
---
A fight against Sierra Bravos should be a terrifying end game experience, Much less their queen. As it stands, i can run the queen several times in a row taking less damage than a single run through of westek. 
---
I'd love a dance emote. Its my go to in Warcraft or Overwatch when nothing much is going on. Just spamming emotes is not the same...
---
I made it to the the surface area just below that sign. Thought about posting it, but looks like you got higher! Nice work!
---
What for? A handful of caps and an epeen stroke?
---
They nerfed that some time ago. Sorry!
---
Standard practice, always check the bodies later if no immediate drop.
---
Infinite loading glitch also gets fixed if you come back later to check the body. 
---
Found a bag at whitesprings yesterday had over 850 plastic and lots of other metals love it when that happens 
---
I love that attitude that some fellow players have:
---
'I have never experienced this behaviour myself therefore is either something wrong on your side, you are lying or just imagining things'.
---
'Could you possibly at least consider that something in the game might be not working as intended?'.
---
'La la la cannot hear you over the sound of my awesome zealotry la la la'.
---
MedX is really more like morphine or oxycontin (I know they are close but Med X is a medically supplied drug) and jet in jenkem (which I'm a little disturbed my phone already knows how to spell)
---
Paint me like one of your ghoul girls
---
Infa xx on Xbox sells them for 50 caps
---
Probably because sleeping is a time consuming action, and since the game is online/multiplayer you can't have a time-skip like on Fo4/Skyrim
---

I have an open door policy. I have had several camps in and around the Flatwoods area with all doors unlocked. My workstations are in a garage with the garage door open and my water filters are unlocked too. I like to hope newbies can get supplies from me to help them. 
---
What a dumb thing to get upset about.
---
Theres alot more servers to choose from. Just logout and log back in.
---
It's actually pretty amusing. Did you tuck your skirt in and attempt the event while nuked? I am guessing not.
---
People bitch about everything these days.
---
But its better knowing that they cant kill you via slap damage if you don't fight back.
---
I’d be interested in that.  Like I said, I only have a modest amount of caps, but right now I could offer 3k.  
---
Or if you prefer trade, I have some power armors to choose from and maybe a few plans you would like for it?
---
Or maybe a combination of the two?
---
If you want heavy weapon and power armor, you only really need strength and intelligence maxed and 3 in luck for the heavy weapon perk there (cant remember the name right now). Everything else depends on what you wanna do. If you are level 30 you should be able to adjust you're special pretty easily, and once you hit 50 you will be able to pick the exact perk cards you want every time you level up
---
Usually when I do it’s a completely blank inventory 
---
That is a good idea. 
---
Prior to today, I was attacked only once since the game came out. It just seemed that yesterday they really wanted to kill me.
---
Are you wearing military fatigues and cap? 
---
Yep done this yesterday before signing off. managed to sell 35 lbs from my inventory and also freed up 40 lbs from my stash so I'm now below 690 lbs. but it takes a lot longer than 15mins. 
---
Nope.  Had they made everybody start fresh on brand new servers then yeah I would be excited.  As it stands right now I have no interest in it.
---
 I will only be logging in to compete the weekly missions for the weapons.
---
Got one not long ago
---
I suspect we’re getting a variation of the Nuka cola lamp. One day after the nukashine launch the lights in both my friend’s CAMP and my CAMP were showing a faint nuka cola in white instead of the regular light pattern. Might have just been a fluke but I’m going to stay hopeful because that light was AWESOME! 
---
Use two mats :^ ) But seriously try putting the item on a mat that's on another mat and then move the bottom mat.
---
Do the quests esp the main story line.  The right side of the map is a bit tougher.  Explore all points of interest there’s a lot to see.
---
Bulk up that crap and sell it lol
---
When there's a quest to take a workshop I usually take it and serverhop just to get rid of it the second the challenge triggers. Thank you Bethesda for the nice PvP system.
---
&gt;Fortunately you can train yourself on adventure and jump into survival when you are ready.
---
 This is exactly why I won't be playing survival.
---
I'm not sure how you can even call that a survival mode.
---
They should have started us all with fresh characters and go through the whole game again but with the added danger. 
---
Congrats comrade. For correcting a peasant you get 3 internet points
---
You can pop through with melee vats.  Draw a enemy to opposite side or have a friend go hostile 
---
Raiding is part of the game. I'm just being a raider lol!!! Its just a game
---
Theres a player VS player community. Im playing against you. Im not on your team. Sorry if it makes you anrgy!  It really shouldn't  bother you! Its part of the game Bethesda sold me. 
---
Someones gotta be the bad guy!
---
Invest in perk Iron Fist and equip only Knuckles. Be the champion of Appalachia with your most reliable fist! I wanna try that myself lol
---
Currently I'm doing no perks until I can unlock my entire build post lvl 50. All I've done is assign my initial 7 special points. As for weapons, whatever i find that is level appropriate. Currently I am level 41 using a level 35 mutants/fire rate 10mm handgun and a zealots/+40% more power attack damage shishkebob. It's been pretty fun. I started two days ago, and my goal is to have it finished by the time the survival mode comes out. At which point I will transfer all my pvp gear over. But I might do this again and take my time with it, it's been challenging but still fun.
---
I really should get back into play this. I ended buying the PS4 and PC versions of the game, prefer the PC version, but I only get to level 7. I wouldn't want to be helped out, just not killed by other players because they think it's funny. But I would always help low levels if I was able. 
---
The soda bar robot in whitespring says they have it exclusively so I imagine it wasn't too hard to get your hands on it.
---
It heavily depends on what playstyle you like.  
---
If you haven't tried it yet, you should go for heavy weapons/power armor build, it's totally great.
---
You should get change up your calling card to those Expulsion Notices from, I believe, the Cranberry Bog area.
---
Yeah, with a macro you could easily get dozens of levels in a couple of hourse. Some lads let it run for days and then went all "look at muh epic level dudez."  
---
It was also a cheap way to get those resources from the trap and sell it for max caps with all the vendors, since you had thousands to sell anyway, not only did they macro to insane levels, they also (ab)used it for as much caps as they wanted.
---
I've said my piece and proven that you're not a raider, just a cheating griefer. I've got nothing more to say, because you only ever have the exact same excuse. Because you _know_ what you are.
---
But then you'd be grinded by nolifes for first few weeks and then we'd be EXACTLY where we are now - new players will enter non-fresh arena.
---
I have lots of free time and lots of in-game knowledge. In fresh start situation I am 100% sure I'd be able to fight and win against current generation of godbuilds, yet godbuilds would be more common and the advantage of having lots of time would be the most important factor when it comes to leaderboards.
---
If you want it more survival - do not support one-time fresh start. Support seasonal character reset where survival characters are periodically transferred to adventure, like in Diablo 3. That could actually be fresh and fair. One time fresh start is basically saying "people have better gear then me now, so take it away, but screw those who will join later than me". Its absolutely unfair and anti-casual and pro-griefer move to separate the character pool and not do seasonal resets.
---
I have ten and would want more. T-45, T51B, T-60 and X-01 of every possible paint scheme, Vault-tec, American, Nuka-Cola, Quantum, Prototype... It stacks up.
---
That's not not how it's supposed to work!!
---
No but if you do this game is perfect for you. I actually stopped playing because fuck management inventory, this is Fallout, get that shit out of here lmao
---
Thanks for the tip! I know where some of my points I've been saving will go now. 
---
Feel your pain, I was camped next to Hillfolk Hotdogs for months and one day logged into that message.  No amount of restarting or hopping cleared it out, the only difference I could see was a new lamppost which wasnt even in my CAMP vicinity.
---
It even lets you place your CAMP there still, but I had no luck replacing my sprawling mansion as I'd basically melded into the surrounding terrain over time with some finely tuned placements.
---
Your welcome!
---
Suggest waiting until survival mode is out so you get a perma bonus on XP
---
I've had it happen once where after 20 minutes there was still no  drop, for both a friend and myself (same enemy). It was a 3 star glowing one. It dropped plans for both of us, nothing I would call rare but certainly nothing I would ever expect a glowing ghoul to drop. Mine was ultra-light combat arm plans, I can't recall what his was. But yeah, we checked the body several times over the course of 20 minutes before server hopping. Very disappointing but it's only happened once since the latest patch.
---
at least I wouldn't, lol.
---
everything got a nerf maybe melee is next(hope not) but it is what it is. 
---
Try going to random event areas on the roads, eg. Responder Vendor bot, suitcase with note inside, unexploded nuke bomb etc. Look for a man dressed in civil war outfit (civil war re-enactor) He usually has the plan on him. It’s how I got mine. 
---
Until then use the settings provided by the driver.
---
I found some on some trees near the dryer building near a river
---
So, was there a Nuka-Cola superfan in every Fallout game? There’s this guy, the girl with the cappy glasses in fo4 (Nuka DLC), and I remember a bunker / side quest in NV at least. 
---
its not just in PC i had some horrible frame drop and few game crashes and disconnects. (xbox)
---
i was in a nuke zone and it felt like I had like 5 fps. 
---
I hear your side and partially agree. I am lvl 150 with some kickass gear I have acquired on my own.
---
 So my suggestion has nothing to do with inferior gear.
---
 I'm more worried about the mass amounts of way overpowered weapons and gear that were duped and sold to the player base.  The market was absolutely flooded with them.
---
 I just wanted to start fresh so everybody is on an equal footing. If you happen to find one of those God mode weapons or armors while in survival mode then great you are 1 step ahead of everybody else.
---
Still though as it stands right now I will not be participating in the survival mode because of this.
---
 I will log in to do the weekly missions for the unique weapons,  as long is the requirements aren't ridiculous.
---
That would be fun
---
My OCD agrees... Though it's more than 15 minutes
---
Im a bad guy. Seek revenge. The interraction isn't over after the first time i kill you...
---
Go ahead. Try to get the junk back lol. 
---
Somones gotta play the bad guy. Im allowed to play this way. Bethesdas got my back. 
---
Hi ,my age level is + 34 from the 18 + age😂  
---
I 'm level 45 and enjoy Fallout76. 
---
I have the mic on all the time. I.'m EU . Belgium time zone on PS 4. 
---
I like to play alone and I like to team up. 
---
look me up

I'll send you invitation if you want...
---
While trying to recreate a version of the Brahmin launcher with the spike board trap, I’m having trouble getting the spike board trap to clip to a foundation, it seems to only work when the spike board trap is clipped directly to the ground, do you know what I’m doing wrong or how to get the spike board trap to function while it’s on a foundation?
---
Well, yeah if you kill a wanted player who has no inventory items, nothing in their stash and no caps, I suppose you will get nothing.
---
I wouldn't call that a floor as much as I would call it bad luck
---
PLEASE don't let it be a fluke as I have them positioned in my camp so they project "Nuka Cola" across the walls and the effect is subtle but incredibly pleasing! :D
---
Killed her 6 times yesterday no problem. Always between 5 or 10 minutes. 
---
Honestly I think it's fine for the game to have a single mob type that's not a pushover. You don't need legendaries to outscale 99% of the mobs in the game. 
---
one of the discord servers im on drops 20+ nukes a day. Its usually the same half dozen or so people running them. Im getting bored/annoyed with other farming spots since the spawn timer was introduced in patch 7. So ive been running with them more often.  
---
I really just wanna see her health/damage resistance lowered a bit, and her damage cranked waaaaay up. Like kills dudes with a swing, cranked up.   
---
\*\*\* Main  PLOT SPOILER \*\*\*&gt;! I find it really dumb that the same thing that ended almost all human life in Appalachia deals me less damage than a low level death claw.!&lt;
---
Got an AAE Handmade this weekend so they are definitely still dropping. 
---
Will be interesting to see what bethesda say about this after the events finished.
---
You dont get anything from that anyway 
---
Yea gauntlets, power fists, knuckles all work
---
Well yeah, it does happen to have no drops, it's just less common than what people make it sound like.
---
Sometimes the item is literally on the ground next to the dead body... There's a lot of buggy stuff going on.
---
I dont know how I got it, when I was modding some armor I seemed to have the option to add BOS mod which significantly increased the defence stats. I dont think I got it from scrapping and the only event I may have done recently was the the heart of the enemy quest. so could have been a reward from that.
---
I don't know about 1 and 2, but inventory management has always been a staple of fallout.
---
Hover over the quest and stop tracking it. Then visit him in a day. 
---
Mass amount of duped gear indoubtly affected player market. You know what it allowed? It allowed actually getting the stuff you wanted by putting hudreds of hours into trading, instead of getting random stuff by putting hundreds of hours into RNG. I hear your point that the economy is influenced by the duping, but the nature of this influence is that anybody can spent week worth of caps to buy themselves a weapon capable of taking down a godbuild, which in all honesty I can't say is a bad thing for the majority of the playerbase.
---
But if you think duping has been resolved completely then I am afraid its not. I have one easy inventory rollback bug on my hands. I stepped into it like you step into shit, loosing my progress for last 5 minutes like 10 times until I understood its not server disconnection but a code-explosion. This is fairly obscure and hard to find, but once you know it super easy to reproduce. For obvious reasons the only people I gave the details were Bethesda support, but I can't know if somebody found it too. I reported it at the end of patch6 era so I doubt its been fixed yet, for obvious reasons I'm not trying to reproduce it anymore so I dunno its patch7 status.
---
Exactly, one shotting kills any hopes of decent PvP though, that shouldnt be possible in a PvP situation. But its Bethesda so it is!
---
You can buy Calibrated shocks for the excavator armor from the responder bot in Grafton (the town, not the station). Cost a pretty penny though.
---
“There is no room for the camera”
---
Are you calling me fat, Fallout 76?
---
focus on springs, gear, lose screws, fiber optic ( material needed to fix/craft waepons and gear)
---
othr material depens what you want to do but I run with 100-200 of each or less again depens on what you need or want. 
---
it will be easier when you get to higher lvls, i was wasting more time reorganizing/cleaning out my stash then playing the game, then I just learned what i need/want and its easy now. 
---
as far as perks i did asked myself the same question and now I could tell you start maxing your build perks first (damage or boost adding perks for your build) and worry about maxing the QoL perks after you had maxed your damage perks first. 
---
you are in a perfect lvl I would say becuase you still have the advantage to lvl up and pick the skill and the card you want after lvl 50 you need 2 lvl too do the samething. so knowing what build you want means you can be done with your build by lvl 50, im  at lvl 75 and still fixing mx build becuase I focused on the QoL perks first and i wish I did it the other way around. 
---
if you are playing on XBOX, i am more than willing to hellp out onn whatever you need. thats goes for anyone that reads this. send me a pm her and we go from there
---
Hell not even limiting yourself that much, I carry 7 weapons (2 of which are heavy) and I’ve always got 60/70lbs of junk room left over 
---
I have a pet mega sloth. It's adorable, and huge, and fucking hates cats! I don't know what the deal is! "Friendly" creatures regularly spawn across the river I camp at and my sloth chucks boulders at any cat. I'll hear a hiss and a roar and oh, another dead tabby. He has anger issues.
---
Pick up a 'naturally occurring' Pickaxe Pilsner.
---
Give it to Biv.
---
Profit.
---
Nope. Your max stash weight is predetermined by Bethesda. When we started, it was only 400lbs. Bethesda has increased it by 200 lbs twice now, saying that they are only doing so once they determine that they can add extra space for us without disrupting the stability of the game. They may increase it more in the future, but at the moment we don't know if/when.
---
Thanks for the help man, i m on pc..
---
Warbrand is lying, it's not in the game yet...
---
This was me and my gang!!!! 
---
I recognize the name!! You owned a work shop. We tagged it and killed you while you were talking to the watoga vendor. We took our sweet time collecting your junk. 1200 steel! Why didnt you run for the bag man???
---
You coulda got your stuff back. It took us a while to free up the space we needed for your junk. 
---
This was at watoga station. You owned abandonded bog town on PC.
---
PSA don't carry hundreds of pounds of junk while owning a workshop!
---
I'm not sure if it is still this way, but it used to be that your junk bag wouldn't appear until you respawned.
---
Not at all true. They literally kept the 'bug' that your companion had unlimited carry weight as long as you commanded them to pick up the item or search people because it was liked by people. Hoarding and collecting have always been a staple of Fallout and one they actively (well I guess passively since they didn't intend to do it but made a choice to keep the bug, so whatever that is) kept and supported. That's partially why there was such a backlash at the start about inventory, people wanted to collect and hoard because it's Fallout
---
Ohh it still works?? I rebuilt CAMP by Helvetica for Fasnacht and hadn’t checked again. 
---
The Fo4 girl is also in Fo3 if im not mistaken. She was only a child when she appeared, but she was in there.
---
For a high strength build, yeah. In my scenario I’m a sneaky weakling.
---
i know right, looks like im going to have to max my luck lol
---
i have done an unarmed (deathclaw gauntlet) + rifle build. Most points in strength and perception. With some in agility for sneak and adrenaline.
---
That sounds very fun actually!
---
I just make a coffee and watch the screen endlessly panning around my corpse while the killer runs around like a headless chicken not knowing why I'm just lying there, I've done this for nearly an hour as the killer kept leaving and returning, it's hilarious.
---
Melee, Rifle, and Crafter/Farmer are a great triad. Get all of the Farming and Crafting perks so that you can farm Stims, Ammo, and such. With Rifle and Melee you are close to other builds and you can tweak them based in game changes. Another good build is close range weapons like Shotgun or Pistol. 
---
Or you join a pumpkin cult and wake up worshiping the almighty pumpkin surrounded by the skeletons of your long dead fellow cult members.
---
Not uncommon for Aussies to knock back 2-3 bottles of spirits, 20 std drinks per bottle, in a big night
---
&gt; They literally kept the 'bug' that your companion had unlimited carry weight as long as you commanded them to pick up the item or search people because it was liked by people
---
no, they didn't fix it because its Bethesda and they rarely act on bugs unless they are major/game breaking.
---
&gt;Hoarding and collecting have always been a staple of Fallout 
---
exactly. to hoard and collect, you need to *manage your inventory* properly.
---
&gt;That's partially why there was such a backlash at the start about inventory
---
the backlash was about the stash box, and that was only a result of Fallout 4: the only fallout that had a home base inventory because it involved building. Inventory management was *huge* in Fallout 3 and New Vegas because you had your carry weight and your companion's and that's it. the alternative to not managing is walking slow or exploiting the game.
---
Whenever I see bags, I usually take the whole thing and move it to a container so it lasts longer for others 
---
Im on console :[
---
Tbh I don't think you'll have time to do all the tasks plus I very much doubt you'll get the area with no one doing the event... so probs impossible to ever find out 
---
Did it solo a couple days ago, but could only keep 2 of them alive. Got an owl mask and a ribbon plan. Already had gotten both.
---
excatly what I was refering too, thank you for pointing it out lol
---
Which Platform you are would help
---
I believe you've seen one, but being that they've only been seen on PC and we know folks got into the Dev room on PC it sort of makes me conclude it's probably not a legit parade drop...
---
Well when you become a seasoned drinker you can handle more, at that time I was drinking 500ml of scotch per night and more on weekends. These volumes are not uncommon amongst Australians.
---
Cool! 
---
What I do is keep every plan and recipe I come across. Then give em all to new players, there's usually around 50 with a couple of SBQ plans. I tend to get plenty of heart emotes.
---
I thought so.
---
Strangler Blooms are bugged, are trying dozens of times with or without Heart of the Swamp event always at night and not getting a single bloom I gave up and just use RadX diluted instead.
---
You can buy the *plans* there, not the mods, those only cost 289 caps or something. And I had hunted them down long before the plans were available at that vendor.
---
What system? If you're on Xbox I've got a ton of crimson flux...
---
It's a new random encounter added when the nukashine quests were
---
hahaha, nice :D
---
I’ve had this happen a few times. I remember in Fallout 4 sometimes when you killed a legendary minion it would “fly” off the corpse and be sitting somewhere on the ground. Is that possible in this game or am I wasting my time searching the ground around them too?
---
Power armor is fairly underpowered in PvP actually. You can regularly get one shotted through a full set of T60 or X-01, which is ridiculous... You're supposed to be a walking tank but one shotgun blows it up, thats like blowing up an Abrams with one AK-47 burst right against its armor.
---
Which recipe calls for flux?
---
Make some! I’ve gotten well over 1000 acid in the past few days from beeswax in the parade town. 
---
If you're on PC, I'll give you one.
---
Floating liberators are good sniper practice, they are everywhere.
---
Don’t remember the exact name but it is a tick blood drink of some kind. 
---
Idk, I've made a small but respectable fortune off my fasnacht shop. Not everyone wants to do it 60 more times to get a specific plan that they're missing. 
---
I did a perfect solo run yesterday got the tooth and beret. But that was it
---
not at all true.
---
I'm usually around 180/315 for my char and almost always 800/800 for my stash. It's about time for that legendary vendor to come up with his shop :D
---
A lot of the people that play this game are legit the nicest people I've encountered in an online game. It's surprising how receptive people are to a simple wave!
---
Awww. None of my friends are playing any longer , so i was never able to test it myself.
---
yeah the inventory management is half the game. who needs content when it takes 50% of your play-time just to organize your stash. 
---
I was chilled but my refrigerator broke... Sorry 🙃
---
Isnt it amazing that TP is still so plentiful in our world?
---
But... now you have Cat Meat to eat, so at least you're not sad and "Hungry"
---
I’ve been playing this game since launch and I’m only 33, how do people level up so fast?
---
Depends on your build. First, skip PA completely and accept that without 0.1% super build and extremely specific gear, PA is so useless in PvP that the majority of PvPers thinks it actually cannot be used effectively against other players. It can, but thats besides the point.
---
Dense mod for chest is a must have for all besides the tankiest of builds (they may skip it for some other mods, but this again is something majority would disagree). My build is probably not tanky enough to survive without dense, haven't exactly had a chance to test that safely until I drop or somebody sells me dense robot armor mod/plan - PC :p
---
Fireproof is also extremely good at negating explosion damage. Pre-TSE nerf these two things alone allowed you to shoot your feet with TSE shotgun and survive (that would kill all non-sentinel builds normally).
---
If you don't have much use for your action points go with dodgy perk, the way this 30% is applied is such that effectively its often much more.
---
If you are still fairly new, hunt markets for armor that contain either -15% dmg when sprinting or when standing still. These are so-called minor perks and you can only get em on 3* armor. If they have Assasin effect on the prefix slot, actual name of these pieces changes to sentinel (standing) or cavalier (sprinting) and these armor pieces are the ones currently most sought after. You might have troubles in getting them without trading some great item for them, and TSEs are raley considered great enough to buy such pieces.
---
If you want to play high damage low-health builds you probably prefer to have some unyielding sentinel/cavalier armor. These are too between most sought after.
---
Weightless sentinel armor is the meta for chameleon-based builds too, as its the only way to keep sentinel defensive bonus when invisible without using stealth boy.
---
Fortunately, sentinel/cavalier pieces without assassin/unyielding/weightless are rather obtainable for caps.
---
I once saw a guy near my camp so I fast traveled, tracked him down, realized he just started an event, completed the event with him then killed him for going near my camp. I understand it’s hostile but it’s my camp.
---
I had this with 'drink fresh beer'. I had no beer so I crafted two. Did not work. Server hopping did not change the quest, crafted two more. Next day I still had the same quest. Score a sneak attack while under the influence of fresh beer. Crafted 8 more, even tried a melee sneak attack. I'm a sniper build so sneak attacks are about every shot. Finally transferred a beer I found 'in the wild' from a lower toon to this one and first shot got it. I'm thinking crafted beer, while satisfying the 'drink fresh beer' portion, will not count on the sneak attack.
---
Just an honest robot trying to make a living
---
It never happened to me, the junk bag always spawned the moment I've killed someone.
---
I've had the opportunity to solo it twice. First time I got the bots to the radtaods, and a nuke warning went off. I just left them to their fate.
---
Second time I had just cleared the radtoads, and a horde of 20-60 lvl players all jumped in. 
---
&gt; keep any Legendary you have
---
I would IF I HAD MORE STASH SPACE!
---
I will begin collecting data on all my farm runs.
---
wish youd have posted a while ago. I've got over 3k in kept weight. so much data lost...
---
I’m still yet to stumble across him! Really want those recipes!
---
Same here! I consider it a challenge to get in. Trouble is those brick windows make it too easy
---
What happens if all the marchers are destroyed?
---
Yall are very "RAD"ical
---
...I will see myself out
---
started a solo yesterday. completed the start up, got through frogs, got through mutants. as i started to march from the super mutants to the final area, someone showed up. they helped fight what i thought was the last wave of mutants. from there, suiciders came nonstop, continuing to spawn even after the event. the wave of stingwings and wolves was *enormous* and seemed never ending too. we ended up with only 2 bots.
---
while i didn't necessarily finish the solo, it was extremely strange how different the final waves were for that run. thought it was worth mentioning somewhere. i have done it with groups of 10+ people only for ~2 stingwings and a wolf to spawn at the end. since that run i was thinking that maybe they want you to try it with less. granted, i only got a set of plans from that drop.
---
And if they can stop its lighting pattern coming off other lights that'd be great, thanks...
---
perfect meaning no damage to bots?
---
Dude.
---
I wish to know that too :D
---
the event fails if they all die. it also fails if the parade doesn't finish in time. i think the latest i started it and still got it was around 10 min.
---
Follow the main quest and do the daily quests as they pop up. Watoga is good for farming xp once you do Mayor for a Day. 
---
The last time I bothered to run the parade event, the Megasloth dropped .44 rounds(5) for me.
---
I have had lots of enemies recently not dropping any legendaries after checking for them for a long while.
---
Right, ps4
---
I’m on ps4
---
So in 25min solo you can get 50 wood, kill three honey beasts, gather 10 stiens or 20 beeswax or 20 intestines or 20 eggs and/or play a musical instrument.  Then wait for the robots to gather, kill a bunch of radtoads/ SM suiciders and then wolves/bugs/sloth 
---
And all that without anyone entering the event to join you, most don't have microphones or speak your language to tell them to go away because you want to do it solo.
---
Sounds impossible to me 
---
Not sure what system youre on, but I've noticed in the last week, on Xbox, I've been using fusion cores quicker than ever. Diluted stims also don't seem to do as much. I have both first aid 3 and power user 3 equipped. 
---
Same here tbh, I havnt encountered him either 
---
Stopping to block player during session .
---
Why?
---
Get in the freezer then🤔
---
Wait you can sit on them? I usually just stand up and poop... Maybe that’s why the ring is brown when I arrive sometimes...
---
I got into the game and got all mixed up. I have plenty of gunpowder, not enough lead!
---
I'm 140 playing since launch. I started to level fast when I found a good ghoul Slayer weapon. This and power armor helped me plow thru whitesprings. And early on the xp given was crazy high. I would go up 3 levels at a Nuke zone. 
---
Nowadays I level up maybe once a day. Hitting up locations to find good legendary enemies. 
---
Thanks, looking forward to your experience!
---
What??? I've got my camp between Top of the World and Bolton Greens. I've never seen a fissure site in the area. I will admit to having a SB flyover, though. More than once, but they aren't ever hostile. 
---
Just two things to add:
---
1) If toilets are activated I sure as heck will want to browse my pipboy while taking care of business.
---
2) Biv better start handing out a prison toilet wine recipe named Honey Wagon.
---
That is all.
---
I like to bring people to the door because I already have a key and hopefully the plan is already there
---
Super contextual, depends on the platform and on each particular deal.
---
If you are on PC then go to vendor and check how many caps you can get from them. Feel free to use mentats and hard bargain. Screenshot me the price. I'll pay double.
---
And my all rise
---
That's just the Scorchbeast fairy put your Scorchbeast lung under your pillow and when you wake up you will have some caps under your pillow.
---
It was a couple of days ago, but I was in a few parades where the suiciders spawned at double rates - probably 12-13 instead of 5-6. It was nuts.
---
At your level get a set of level 25 power armor, take 2 points in blocker, and farm White Springs. You can easily survive ghoul swarms and level hard. Events always give XP too.
---
I've kept a tradition going over passing around a level 5 baseball bat that deals around 55 damage with no perks. I got it at Flatwoods when I was new, and I passed it on about a month, and I hope they will do the same aswell.
---
New to the game, how does the budget system work? How do increase my budget?
---
I feel like a lot of the toxic people decided to spew their bile on forums and social media about how much they hated a game they never played or even really looked at and the more reasonable people bought and played it.
---
I used to run through the silos and nuke the hell out of Whitesprings when it was worth it. My TSE was doing about 1000 damage and I could level 10-20 times in a short period of time.
---
I leveled 3 times last night (I'm a 125) doing the Fasnacht event over and over again (I just wanted to try to get all of the masks) and running through Glass Cavern. 
---
You can have it all before the event
---
yall don't crouch when you gotta go?
---
Glass Cavern still has decent rewards if you're looking for the XP. The legendaries were actually dropping the appropriate legendary items last night.
---
I hate how wild cats in this game are marked as hostile even though they don't attack you at all. Also, Cheswick at Wixon Homestead always bums me out every time a help a new level through there.
---
As much of a pain in the ass it is to keep my CAMP by the overseer's camp, I keep it there for low levels. Beds, purified water, free steel, you name it. 
---
Yes aae handmade and combat shotgun and mines go a long way
---
Give away or drop any ammo you don’t currently use.  If you change your weapon in the future, you will find more ammo.  No point in hanging on to ammo you don’t use.
---
Haha, you and I have been over this on another thread.  Have to agree to disagree until more information comes out I guess
---
I want one if trying to farm the marsupial mutation but it most working 
---
How! I climb on the top of the building but the sat dishes have no geometry!!! Tell me your ways!!!
---
I like leaving poop bags in people's camp. Spoiled bio fluid, spoiled meat, whatever.
---
I can only confirm as far as last night :) I have them projecting against the corrugated iron walls of the little shack I hope to use for my vending machine!
---
I had been missing the BOS Combat Arms, even before they were removed from the Tech Data reward pool, I could just never get that one. I had read that they could also come from Treasure digs in the Cranberry Bod or Savage Divide, but after digging over 100 of those maps, still no arms plan. I had also read that you could get it from scrapping Combat Armor, but that never seemed to work either, then out of the blue on Thursday night, I found the plan laying on a shelf, and was beside myself with joy.
---
The location was a little Flea market looking spot near Top of the world, if you're coming from Pleasant Valley lodge, towards Top of the World, it's on the left, but I suspect it could also spawn in other locations as well.
---
Top Hat plan can spawn at many locations. 
---
It would also be nice if I didn’t have to ft to 6 (5 +1 because I will inevitably forget and revisit one) different vendors to sell stuff. Can we just have a total cap limit instead of per vendor? 
---
I think you get a "your camp is under attack" in the top left 
---
here is the link I have used in the past to find plans, i hope this helps.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_plans](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_plans)
---
i hope im not breaking any rules by posting the link here
---
The spike board trap is weird because the wiring for it is underneath, so placing it can be kind of tricky. If you're putting it on pure foundation you would likely need to position the "spring" part of the board as close to the edge of the foundation as possible so the "invisible" connector sticks out but it is extremely finicky. This might not be possible if you have walls in the way. Even if you position it correctly the external wiring itself has to also be positioned carefully before it will connect. I don't recommend putting them on foundations just because they don't work super well.
---
In my videos I'm actually using floors, not foundations. Flooring works much better because you choose the "wire mesh" flooring and wire through it easily. Once you're done wiring you can "replace" the floor with solid floor and the connections will stay connected. The mesh floors are great for all kinds of vertical wiring jobs.
---
My calling card is a single 10mm round in a bag on their pillow. I legit watched a guy find it once, panic, and leave the game. 
---
Yeah I've seen some PVP action go down after the event. 
---
Hey hope you don’t mind if I ask a few questions. I don’t pvp but I am going to start with survival. Really want those new legendaries. I am a 1H/heavy gun bloodied build. Pve I use unyielding sent BOS. I have a sent ass bos and vanguard sent marine set.  I’m changing my armor because Im not yet used to the speed of pvp.
---
Why is PA useless in PVP?
---
Do you think I should go with dense or is this armor Tanky enough to pass?
---
What console are you on? I gotta watch out 👀
---
Personally, I'm about to build a character that'll be using damage negation perks, but not Dr, so I can run beserkers with no armor. Weapons will be small one handers and throwing weapons, no guns. 
---
Perks I'll use for damage negation include dodgy, blocker, and fire proof. 
---
I saw him at Charleston station when I was trying to  get the responder bot to spawn
---
I actually enjoy cleaning up my inventory, stash or build my base the X-time quite a lot. Keeps me chilled after work
---
Unless you take the hotbox perk which lets you light one up inside your helmet. 
---
She was probably like, 20 in 3 actually
---
more importanly where do I get the plans for them? 
---
I for one im very excited,i even see the overpowered players as a danger in the world. I mean mobs can be beaten by abusing the system a bit but those Level 200+ players will make you have to find a way around them or to reason with them, if you're lucky
---
all you need to do is take over 4 or 5 workshops, you'll be running round defending them from attack most of the time, exactly like saving the settlements in FO4  
---
no problem.
---
How much are you willing to pay for one? On the market they can go for 2500+ caps
---
And it should be like -4 agility. You should lose AP since you can’t sprint with all that tar in your lungs and you lose sneak because everyone can smell you from a mile away. 
---
... thats where it has been coming from?
---
Wow. okay.
---
I can't find any information on ineffectiveness of AA mod on energy weapons. Some dated info mentions the AA reducing ballistic resistance rather than the energy one. Now AA may not stack with Explosive (which you're probably confusing with Energy (both start with E, I know)), but it's not meant to as there is no explosion resistance stat to reduce in the first place.
---
Stalker can still be used with sneak melee technically, even though it's not very convenient. 
---
Unyielding armor is best for like 30+ perception agility and luck
---
I completed it a long time ago and went there recently and he said something to me like "This must be a mistake. It says here you're a general now."
---
Seriously, you have to go get the military fatigues and put them on.
---
Congrats, Comrade. For acknowledging a fellow peasant's internet accomplishment, you have been awarded 3 internet points...wait, what's this? *I have been awarded 3 internet points!*
---
I'm wanting to avoid glass cannon/unyield bloody build at all cost. Nerf bat is coming for them
---
why do you need to be in power armor when using a Gauss rifle? I only have a basic one, do they get really heavy once fully modded?    
---
If you choose transfer all junk to stash, it moves the mods too.  Maybe the mods are in your stash?
---
Nope. Happy for others that will enjoy it tho.
---
&gt;So in 25min
---
it's 30 minutes.
---
&gt;you can get...
---
yes. all items are extremely easy to gather. once you have done the event several times, you should know where to find everything you need in abundance. if you're farming, you should already have all the mats ready to go. the only thing that may be difficult is wood if you have literally zero. even then, there are plenty of wood piles and fallen trees around. as long as you haven't hit them recently, there is more than enough. small animals have several spots where they spawn like crazy, radtoad eggs are literally right there, decorating is a joke, steins spawn in all the same places and can be found in 2 minutes or less, and beeswax can all be gathered in 20 seconds. you're also exaggerating the requirements. it's 10 beeswax and 12 intestines.
---
defending the bots is just as easy. idk what level you are, but i literally one shot everything that spawns at this event short of the mega sloth. it is a low-level event.
---
the only *real* obstacle is getting people to not join, and admittedly, its my fault for overlooking that part of your comment. i didn't see that statement. my comment was solely on the capability to do the event alone in the time frame, and it is absolutely possible. even considering people joining, it is hardly *impossible.* there are a couple people in this thread who have done it.
---
Yeah I wouldn't even trust what you find online, people put stuff on the various wikis on a whim. I think there's more to strangler blooms because the only consistent method to harvest them seems to be by completing the quest
---
The game needs more upbeat music, if you ask me. If I have to listen to another slow, mumbling, "I'm a sad miner" or "the girl I love left me" song, I'm going to pierce my own ear drums.
---
Damn I might have to save up a bit. I was saving up just enough to buy it from the vendor but I spawned him in a couple of times with the coat not in the inventory. Right now I’m only at 800 caps or so.
---
Agreed.   But you should change your title so that it starts with “wouldn’t it be nice if....”
---
I can help you with the lead martini ,but I used my mats to make my 20 hard lemonade and cannot make more mixed.
---
Anyway one easy mixed drink is the hard lemonade. You find the recipe at the lemonade stand. It took me like 3 server hops to find. I should be on at 7 pm CET. And then later in the evening.
---
Confirmed dropping a nuke causes *one* strangler bloom to spawn.
---
I have hated that song since I saw Halloween 2 roughly 23 years ago now ... 23 years that song has freaked me the fuck out and now I can't enjoy the goddamn 10 fucking songs in the game because of Mr Sandman. Fuckin guy. 
---
Candy from a baby.
---
I'm maxed on caps, so I can't accept the reward, but until Bethesda decides to walls impermeable to power armor placement, no camp is secure.
---
Source: built fort Knox, only to be shown how easy passing through walls is.
---
I'm pretty sure slap damage is actually hard-capped at like 5 damage for a hit.
---
If you have a workshop you're auto-flagged for PVP and it's not slap damage, just regular damage.
---
I got attacked yesterday by a bunch of people claiming I griefed them, me and my friends made about 2000 caps each but they destroyed my camp for no reason other than some guy trash talked them with goat in his name.
---
I intentionally leave work benches near windows for this reason. Suck being out of water or in broken armor or maybe you just need a place brew. Locked door is mostly an attempt to keep the wandering enemies out. 
---
Im not interested in buying it I'm just saying thats what I've seen.  I currently have a guy on my friends list selling all of them at 250.  
---
You are twisted ... I like it.
---
I found the BoS leg mod plan as a world spawn last week - near top of the world.  This was on a lvl \~30 character.  I came back on my 120 and server hopped many times, but had no more luck.
---
Full sent assa or full sent unyielding could probably both do without the dense mod. The truth is however that the one I'd use otherwise I will not specify - I'm leaving here an information that there is an alternative valid choice for chest mod, but its not widely known yet and until I know more about reality in survival I intend to keep the details to limited circle. These hints I believe to be enough. If you are not sure what to do definitely go dense.

PA is mostly useless in PvP because you loose 15 legendary effect slots and 5 mod slots in exchange for 6 mod slots. If these 6 mods are not perfectly aligned with your perks and weapons, it will be useless. The details I gave here would be enough to spark researchers into finding it, but again this is such a topic I'm keeping this ace for myself. If I'll see lots of people struggling and I decide my survival experience is not hard enough, we will publish the details.
---
Important thing to say that is currently within the common knowledge domain is that stagger effect is absolutely critical and whatever tool you use against player if it doesn't do crowd control (the stagger) its probably useless.
---
It's odd that I've never had it pop up. 
---
I had the Charleston vendor spawn recently on the road heading south out of morgantown.  It was not that far south of Mama Dolce, right where the road crosses the stream.
---
not just me then...............................wind chimes  oh oh OH      OH       aluminium !
---
I need to get real.
---
i get them through to the last part no problem, but a stingwing always creeps in somewhere lol. closest i had to a perfect run was 4 immaculate bots and one with a *sliver* of damage. at least your experience eases my concern that i missed out on *the* drop.
---
I agree, my feelings got hurt when I saw the chances off me getting a rear mask. I still tried with close to 100 times and im done with it. 
---
New T-60? Blackbird is for all T-series as well as X-01
---
Man it was hilarious to see him, got those recipes too.
---
And here I spent 3 hours last night server hopping just to find ANY nuke zone to farm some flux and I didn’t come across a single one
---
Didn't know it worked for all. But there are new BoS paints. That's what I'm talking about. 
---
It's not always that simple.
---
There are players that will scream "bug" at everything, even if it's not a bug. They're expecting to find bugs and they aren't willing to recheck a dead body in a few minutes. Yeah i agree that the current state of the game is less than optimal, but it's not always doom and gloom.
---
Then there are players that will deny the existence of any bugs, those are the "if it didn't happen to me it doesn't exists". They're just as annoying as the first type.
---
We as a community should try to find the middle ground between "everything is wrong" and "nothing is wrong" and help other players with tips and tricks.
---
Isn't the trick here that you need to snap a foundation to the piece that you can't remove?
---
Go on, tell them your name...
---
Yes, you only get a pop up if a player is attacking your camp. 
---
I agree. We need to be able to label them. I have been building a couple sets other than the one I carry and would like to be able to name them. The one I carry has a custom paint job so it's easy to separate but the other two, tho totally different sets, one t51 and one x01, I have to set out to sort which is which
---
I Had this Last Night At  whitesprings seams to taken me agaes to get to level 30 but once i Hit that i can now survive there 
---
Was even there last night after a nuke dropped 
---
And Plenty of High Level guys helping out when i got swamped.
---
I Also Helped some people out at windigo caves not in there team but good to help each other out.
---
The Game is getting better and better a few bugs  still loving it.
---
I thought she was a teenager. 
---
Well that sucks. But at least I got to wreck 3 SBs back to back. 😂
---
Weightless or vanguard
---
I wish we could get an additional stash box that was shared with my other characters. 
---
I've noticed even when I first log in it seems to take way longer then usual and if I'm near my base it takes even longer then usual. 
---
Nothing will change... except for the complete removal of slap damage... and the planned removal of all non pvp/workshop camp damage... So how the fuck exactly do you expect people to keep griefing? Halfwit. 
---
YOU MONSTER! HOW DARE YOU MAKE ME READ THAT WITH MY OWN EYES!
---
If you are on ps4 I can upgrade your gat plasma with a prime receiver. It MELTS the SBQ.
---
When are you on? I’ve got the outfit for sure I can check if I’ve got another paint plan 
---
I disagree. It’s a radio station not a game soundtrack. Diversity in music genre makes sense in that context. And it offers up a nice change of pace for players who prefer something more upbeat.
---
That music also allows for an additional storytelling element: juxtaposition 
---
On Xbox it's a pretty common occurrence, that everyone I know has endured, more times than they care to remember, I have a virtually unlimited supply of Stimpaks, so I tend to just string them along for as long as I can, I figure if they are following me around, then they aren't harassing someone else.
---
What platform is the Tyler County Train-station on?  Also what GT name for said platform so that we can find you.
---
It continues to amaze me how friendly this game's community is. Usually, toxic people are drawn to games like this but, for some reason, the majority of players on this game are some of the friendliest people I've ever encountered in a game.
---
Well the lucky mucker quest triggered this morning once so theres that. I also did heart of the enemy after the update but that hasn't occurred since.  I think I've done every daily so unless something changes I'm boned....
---
I may have been unclear. The Gauss Rifle ammo counts as "energy" ammo, so it benefits from the weight reduction of Batteries Included. So even if I weren't using power armor, I'd still be running the perk. Therefor, I might as well wear the power armor and carry a fuckton of cores. 
---
Listen for the squeaking.
---
Never skip leg day.
---
I thought they addressed this in the last patch as well as foundation stacking. I don't think it's possible anymore. 
---
I'd assume at least 18, considering Ronald's... intentions
---
I am very much looking forward to rebuilding the rad showers at all my vendor camps, since the A$$hats won't be able to destroy them anymore.
---
If you are pc. I challenge you to get into my bunker 
---
My point here is not that I need ceramic, but that "porcelain" steins contain no ceramic.
---
Nice, thank you.
---
I will give it a try :)
---
I'd probably give out some of my lower charged cores in a situation like that. But nobody wants them. They want the 100% ones. The ones I spent the time to capture and defend a power station to acquire. 
---
Wasn't exaggerating the numbers, I just couldn't remember exactly how many you needed from memory. Every time I've done the event I've had people join it even tho I was the only one there originally.
---
thanks for the clarification, I thought that as I modded up the rifle it was going to end up weighing 40+ lbs 
---
VATS is, in my experience, most useful for low-AP automatic guns auch as auto pistols. Anything too heavy and too slow firing will cost so much AP that it can be borderline useless. 
---
Take the pieces off the chassis.  Hop in the empty frame.  Get out of the frame and put the pieces back on the chassis.  Then fast travel.  The chassis is now yours and even with the high level pieces it will be automatically reclaimed in your storage.
---
Its' on a hill northwest of Watoga.  I think it might be just down the hill (east) from Westek?
---
This comes up every few days, the "blooming" pods are NOT tied to an event (other than the Radshield event).  Whenever I need them I just server hop at the chem plant until they are up.  I found them last night for Radshield, I found them this morning for the beer.  I generally find them blooming at night.  
---
Bounce games and you will find them.
---
Really?0.0
---
I do not know what made you stop playing but I would say yes it way better now it still have it buggs and stuff but its gotten way better. 
---
checl that patchnotes and road map for past updates and new. 
---
Just get a refund dude their are better games to play out there that are not trying to bleed more money out of you. You clearly are a loyal gamer and this is what dear-ol boy is counting on. This game should be an insentive for him to never try this again. 
---
Probably right then, I never played Fallout 3, saw videos on her though. I made an assumption. My bad 
---
I'd take any change to the ludicrous odds st this juncture.   I think its statistically like winning the state lottery which is just silly to me.  It's kind of a bum deal and its discouraging and disappointing,  two feelings I hope bethesda did not want to instill in their loyal player base with this event.   103 runs for me.  Nothing rare.  I'm happy with all the plans but the mask thing is irksome and just illogical to me.
---
And I've got you if you're on PS4.  
---
\*blink\* 
---
I guess for some reason the game could think you're a protectron that's had it's arms removed ? ..they go up in a nuclear explosion a few moments after that happens.  And getting in PA frame -does- change you from human to PArace, so thats likely where any bug causing the game to think you are a robot is coming from
---
PA sucks for PvP cause you don't benefit from legendary armour effects while you're in PA.
---
I agree totally. Either Bethesda want to add to grind or they're just  incompetent, (hard to tell sometimes) but either way it needs to go back to the way it was.
---
You can't 
---
Thanks man def keep trade secrets lol!!! Thanks for the info tho
---
When I get home I can give you some general VATS tips, first some beer. But in a nutshell VATS build is viable for pistols &amp; rifles.
---
the effect is there, i have dropped 4 nukes in the past 2 nights and i have seen that effect on all 4 that was on xbox tho. also I have only seen it when your close enough to the nuke, i just see a smoke mushrrom cloud when im not close enough. 
---
I understand your reasoning but I think the biggest thing is just a the annoyance factor for a lot of people who would rather not have to deal with that period looks like changes are coming though so it won't be a thing sooner than later
---
I think you should consider the Bloodied one, i was avoiding this in the past but give a try and i didnt regret, as sniper we can stay from distance so the low health is not a problem but the most advantage is the boost on perception and agility that can make your AP points almos infinite (using the right perks).
---
Weightless is also good for you became more invisible.
---
I joined a new server and had two players come say hello. One offered trade and the other just kinda screwed around doing the "taunt" emote. I traded with the other guy then went back inside. 
---
My camp isn't locked as it was located near the Overseers camp and I like to help new players. I've also just had a few players come to admire it, look around and give the thumbs up, so the other weirdo just walked right in and started teabagging me and doing weird shit. After a while I got the notification and he came up wanted. I had pacifist enabled because of the Fasnacht event and he took that as an opportunity to wreck it. I turned it off and me and another player killed him.
---
That's not the worst part though, this weirdo had actually taken screenshots of him doing this to my camp, with my character and GT in one of the shots just minding my own business. Looking at his profile the guy has a YouTube and Twitch account which showed he was active around that time. I don't get the mentality behind destroying it for no reason and going so far as to broadcast and document the evidence?
---
TL;DR I think it would be a good idea that if you have pacifist enabled, others can't destroy your camp and vice versa.
---
Radiation is the least countered damage type and does not get countered by auto-stim legendary armors.
---
Yeah, make the cold drinks bonus last for hours and then turn everybody in survival into cold beverage chugging tryhards lmao
---
Better than that player following people around in the tattered mole mask and bathrobe looping the Barney "I love you" song trough his microphone and making that stupid heart gesture. I probably should have taken a video of him but I decided not to encourage him (or her).
---
Personally I'm waiting a few months before even touching survival mode. I'm concerned that the builds/ weapons that work so well for it right now could end up being nerfed.  I don't want to put time and energy into making a build that Bethesda eventually ends up neutering. 
---
PA does suck for PVP right now, but I   I expect re-balancing down the road when and if Bethesda figures out how broken and unbalanced PVP is. 
---
I don't see how it can continue in its current state where a handful of builds shred everything and other builds are completely useless. 
---
Think from the actual vendor it's 900 caps but as you said most times he  doesn't have it.
---
On a side note the longshoreman outfit the vendor sells for 187+ caps, it sells for about 2k-4k on the market but it's not a common wanted item, so might need to find the right buyer.
---
Selling that might make you some money to buy a hunters longcoat on market.
---
As a cannibal in game, this would be cool, also hope they fix the bug that cannibal isn't affected by carnivore.
---
I had the effect on PC no matter the distance, even seeing from vault 76 to the ash heap, my issue is it's randomly stopped working all of a sudden, I dropped around 3 nukes myself last night and tested at different distendes and nothing, just smoke... tried resetting my .ini files too, I wonder if there is a .ini line i'm missing or something. My game is set to maximum settings bar shadows at medium (because shadows drain FPS like me drinking coffee at 5am)
---
Jet is closer to a standard amphetamine, but it’s extracted from Brahmin dung: 
---
*In the pre-War days, big meat companies had experimented with a cheap protein extract for growing food. However, the product had to be abandoned due to contamination from a skin bacterium, which caused it to act like an amphetamine when ingested. By the time this was discovered, tons of the material were irreversibly contaminated, and rather than destroy it, the meat companies fed it to their cattle in an attempt to recoup their losses - these cattle were the ancestors of the post-apocalyptic brahmin.*
---
*After exposing slaves to vats of brahmin dung sans the plants they had been cultivating, Myron realized that not only had the intoxicating properties of the protein extract been preserved in brahmin tissues, one did not need to slaughter the brahmin to harvest it - Myron was able to develop a process to refine it from their waste, thus providing the Mordinos with the cheap, addictive and fast-acting drug they had been in search of since they had entered the trade.*
---
This... this right here... this wins. 
---
Tick blood tequila 
---
Your entire rant was self defeating. You admitted they kept the bug that made management of inventory obsolete then went off about how it was important. I played the shit out 3, NV, and 4. I know in all those hours, management of my inventory was very little of the experience. If it was an issue and not liked, they would've gotten rid of it just like they upped the stash after complaining. You have no idea what you're talking about and if you managed your inventory when you didn't have to, I don't know what to tell you lol
---
Yup ☝️☝️
---
Better than that player in the tattered mole mask and a bathrobe who follows people around with the Barney "I love you" song looping on his microphone and making that stupid heart gesture. I considered taking a video but didn't want to encourage him (or her). 
---
Thank you. 
---
Every time it has happened to me, I've been dead before I can even finish loading all the way in. 
---
For me though, it is primarily an annoyance factor. I don't PVP. I'm flagged as pacifist. That should exempt me from being forced into PVP. If people want to run around killing each other, more power to them. I couldn't give a shit less. But they shouldn't be able to compel me into participation against my will. 
---
Ah, well, unless they’re different than FO4, it’s more like “darker metallic/orange”. Look up FO4 BoS Paints on YouTube, you can see them.
---
Nuke zones, the majority of my XP came from fighting the queen or glowing ones. However people arent nuking like they used to. Ive only been on a couple servers over the past few weeks when someone launched vs every night a month ago.
---
Dense armor mod for your chest piece. Check vendors (in the mire and cranberry bog) I see them all the time. They are a must have. Protects you from explosive rounds, scorchbeast screams, cars exploding. It will change your game.
---
The one I want is black and red. Super snazzy. 
---
I'll look into that, thanks. What materials would you need to make more hard lemonade? If all else fails, maybe i can provide those.
---
Wonder if Bethesda did this on purpose.....  PvP is coming, and claiming a workshop that produces fusion cores is one way of starting a PvP confrontation.  
---
Oh yes.  I remember you.  The one who carried 1500+ steel on you at all times.  
---
probably gonna be 1400 atoms in the shop
---
If you go almost dead East of relay tower HN-B1-12 it spawned just past the pylons there.  It popped a diseased SB, but it was not aggressive.  I do a regular farm there of iron ore and it's the first time I've seen it.
---
In the case at hand, given that: 
---
- Working out what is in which levelled list and with which chances involves quite a bit of knokwledge given that not everything has been decoded yet and for the aforementioned reason one cannot achieve 100% certainty.
---
- Is a well known fact that items that cannot drop as legendaries like flare guns or syringers have at one point been part of such levelled lists and is not clear whether they still are or not.
---
- Due to code version control issues (or other non-disclosed issues) things that appear as fixed in the patch notes are actually still broken or are re-broken in subsequent patches.
---
It is not unreasonable to assume that if one kills a legendary enemy and its container does not populate with a legendary item within seconds of the rest of the container being populated is unlikely to contain one 'later'.
---
In fact the opposite behaviour could be considered 'folly'.
---
In your camp? You can't sadly. Make sure you scrap anything you've got stored!
---
Unfortunately as of now there isn't. I just found it strange that according to the wendigo lore, eating humans and being greedy is how you turn into one. Yet the Vault Dwellers seem to be an exception mostly likely due to game limitations. 
---
As a melee build there's nothing I hate More than the "I guess I'll just wait until you get bored of screaming at me from the sky" game.
---
I just stand around under a roof taking splash damage and eating stimpacks for sometimes 10 minutes. It's a real joy, that. 
---
Recipes are at whitespring bunker vendor and they drop from scorthbeast queen.
---
at 113 runs so far, i'd be cool with this lol.
---
So bounce servers until you find one with an active nuke zone, yes. Probably faster.
---
Melee weapons did have power in the first 3 Fallouts. Power Fist used energy cells for example. It was a bit of a pain in the ass but not any more than getting ammo for a gun. 
---
This.  To be honest NPCs in previous Fallout titles, and other RPGs for that matter, always end up annoying me.  You navigate through a seemingly endless dialogue tree just trying to figure out what the hell they want you to do, but only after having talked with a bunch of filler characters to find the character you're supposed to be talking to in the first place. It pulls me out of the game and reminds me that I *am* playing a game, instead of allowing me to be immersed in the world.  Yes, the robots in FO76 say the same things repeatedly...but they are programmed robots, so that makes sense. 
---
keep an eye out because I’ve been finding a ton of codes in ash heap. 
---
I sometimes find other people's camps and just look around any maybe use one of the workbenches. As sort of a "thank you for being in the right place at the right time", I leave some Stimpaks and some Radaway as my little calling card since I carry way too much of both at times. Maybe even drop a Nuka Cherry or two.
---
tomorrow
---
 Mi casa, su casa.
---
No you see progression based on what knowledge we have will mean different progression in survival mode to the standard game version.
---
I hear what you said and I think I'll rearrange my camp to be great clearly visible floating penis as part of 'plz wreck' invitation.
---
I’m surprised myself about just how friendly other players are, I’ve been playing for a couple of weeks and I’ve only ever been attacked once, whereas I’ve met countless players 
---
You're welcome to drop by my camp, though sneaking and breaking/entering aren't necessary seeing as how there aren't any doors and everything is publicly accessible by design. I built a store, and I'm not one to chase people off unless they're breaking stuff.
---
Though I must admit, I was utterly perplexed by whomever brought a dozen brahmin to my camp. I left to hit up the vendors and came back half an hour later to find a herd of dead brahmin in my garden. Thanks for the leather and fertilizer I guess, but whiskey tango hotel!
---
Don't forget your 5988Es and that you line date them every day.
---
Dense plus fire proof negates all explosive damage. I fans damage reduction is better than damage resistance. Damage can be reduced using lone wanderer, or legendary armor (sentinel, cavalier, assassin)   
---
Oh right I never used the power fist in fallout 1 so I wasn't sure what it ran on. I read the fallout 3 description and it's described as pneumatic so I went for co2. But then again the old super sledges weren't rocket powered until fallout 4 so it might have just changed. 
---
Thanks! I’ve been waiting for someone to do this :)
---
I also have a bloody gamma and bloody explosive assaultron. I think those would be effective. 
---
What do you mean? Are you wondering if a few *actual* jerks some how got the chance to keep their ill-gotten gains? Probably. But does that mean the innocent should be taken down as well? Hopefully not. 
---
The new pancakes are made with cement...
---
Love it. Great shot
---
and they seem to want more pvp than pve 
---
11 EDT always for updates (though I've noticed it can be a couple of minutes late) 
---
Hey, I'm on PC. I'm only level 44, but if you PM me we can play sometime and I can help level you up. (I don't have many items to give you though :( )
---
Only once have I encountered hostility from another player. Other than that we always just ignore each other, or watch each other's backs while questing in the same area.
---
I was worried about constantly getting ganked at first, but it's really not even an issue at all.
---
I always, ALWAYS, share my extra crap (bullets, chems, resources) at the overseeres box in the church at flatwoods. I know lots of players head there first so i make sure they get stuff they need right away. There are nice people out there in the wasteland.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Shit I never thought of that. It would suck to dedicat to one play style then have it changed. They got new legendaries each week tho I gotta get those lol
---
Whitesprings train station vendor sells warehouse, barn, brick and metal plans.  Just go there.
---
I pieced together a set of 1 star unyielding combat armor by doing BOS events. Line in the sand, distant thunder, surface to air. Took maybe a week or two of hitting every event I saw on many servers.
---
Nice. Damn I should have done that for the shot
---
I think a lot of people on this game are super friendly because were just out here tryin to survive in the wasteland together. I havent logged on in a while, but I used to keep all legendaries I had and then ran a free store to give them to those who needed them for free.
---
TV then, create a settings preset for QoL.
---
Have been so happy with my Excavator Skin Purchase. Was worth doing the daily chores for it.
---
It now has the Atom Shop Mark next to it, so if i have another chasis I can always identify it.
---
I have to say it's sounds awesome.
---
Fallout 76 won't be turned into a realistic survival but it should add some stuff to help out. Can't take away from that good vibe we have already.
---
This was repeated in several places and I confirmed it.
---
Weekly I go through my bulk items and pass it around to friends since I have plenty of other things to sell. They are always amused at my amounts 'I have 76 bulk steel, does anyone need some? I have 27 bulk adhesive, 43 bulk gears, 500 screws...' I bring everything back down to 10 bulk or 50 single pieces because I'll over loot again by next week.
---
100+ runs so far and I'm happy with anything that makes me feel like I'm achieving something. Other than the few thousand caps I've made ofc :P
---
got a few, what do you play on
---
ha yeah that bummed me out too, it looks so nice and clean, BUT THE DOOR IS STILL BROKE!
---
Sometimes i think Bethesda doesnt really know the audience they are making stuff for int heir own game
---
Your definitely not alone, I’ve played since Day 1 and never had as many issues as I’ve had the past 5 days. 
---
Did they fix the assaultron head? 
---
Like, really fix it?
---
This sort of thing is why I do intend to buy the game when private servers and mods are out. I still coming across little things like this in FO4.
---
And I will laugh as I don’t return fire and your shot to the face is for naught. 
---
Yea it loads properly. I heard there was a glitch with the damage but that’s standard operating procedure for this game. 
---
A great way of earning caps is to take over workshops from lower level players. I once got 2000+ caps for repeatedly killing a squad of two at the Munition Factory. They just kept coming and I kept killing. After an hour of massacre I left them be. 
---
That's a tough hand of cards to be dealt, partner. 
---
Also, what do the off-kilter rectangles to the right of two of the players' names mean (the team player names over in the bottom left corner)?
---
No, that’s where you sit on your ha… nevermind. 
---
Iv had it work just one time. 
---
I play on xbox and it's been pretty damn stable for me.  I played for 6 or 7 hours straight on Saturday without being disconnected once.
---
Sorry I dont have any proof at the moment. I'll see if I have any videos on my ps4 when I get home. If not ill see if I can make a video. But honestly it's not that hard (I only have level 1 of the perk) it sometimes takes a few tries but it does work.
---
Update: I got it! :D
---
thanks
---
Low FPS is not my issue. Locked at 60FPS it will simply freeze up and then return to 60FPS, as if nothing happened.
---
When frozen, nothing except the games sound works, not even the mouse pointer.
---
It's happened to me as well. It only started happening with this patch. It didn't happened before 
---
Yeah, this is basically how Skyrim does it too.  Don't want to do quests for the Daedra?  *Then don't do them*.  I think a lot of Fallout fans, especially from New Vegas, expect the game to explicitly pose these choices, or else they assume there is no choice at all.
---
I don't mind the NV approach, but at the same time, it gets into that whole Stanley Parable question of who is really driving the story?
---
lol then I have no idea, 
---
*at that moment
---
Like I said, I was working my way back to sell and craft. I don't normally carry 100+ lbs of junk on me. 
---
I will state, since this started, I have been embedded in circles were exploits are discussed, and there most certainly are *few* ways to still dup. 
---
Just ‘cause we banned are gone doesn’t mean that the problem is also. 
---
Nice. It's my only TSE. 
---
I leave skulls. And paddle ball ammo. 
---
A friend of mine laid Punjab boards on every treadable surface in his last base. Team mates were immune, but every unfortunate visitor ended up rendering the whole place to rubble before leaving.
---
A gunslinger cowboy build can make great use of VATS. That is what I chose for my second character. 
---
... damn. :-(
---
What happens if you spawn the armor and don't get in and simply run away?
---
Do you have to repair the armor? or does it re-spawn in your inv?
---
With the legendary vendor coming soon, I’m absolutely maxed out on my weight as I’m stockpiling legendaries. 
---
Kill it and hope my Bloody Mess perk explode it into pieces and then find a non-gross piece to loot. Easy!
---
I seem to get a lot of junkys medics stalkers suppressor and nocturnal and I can tell you I dont save any of them.   
---
&gt;management of my inventory was very little of the experience.
---
of *your personal experience.* when you have more items that you would like to keep than space/weight on your character, you have to manage your inventory. just because you personally didn't do it doesn't mean that it isn't a staple of the game.
---
&gt;If it was an issue and not liked, they would've gotten rid of it just like they upped the stash after complaining
---
no, they wouldn't have. you are comparing two completely different scenarios. again, there are still *game breaking* bugs in all Bethesda games. people have been vocal about them since release and they have not been fixed. if you think that Bethesda just fixes bugs because people do/don't like them, then you *really* don't play Bethesda games. 
---
Stash space was not changed due to player outcry. from the start, Bethesda said that they planned on increasing the stash space once they can determine that they can do so without disrupting the game's stability. even after they upped it the first time, they said that it still wasn't where they wanted it to be, and would continue to update it. 
---
&gt; You have no idea what you're talking about and if you managed your inventory when you didn't have to,
---
you're clueless. you literally *have to* manage your inventory. it is a requirement. when you pick things up, then choose what to keep what not to keep, that is management. all of these games have been about picking up and collecting bullshit and or things you like. you still have to manage to be under weight. you have no argument.
---
Let's see they weigh 10 lbs each - 1500 lb max weight and 800 lb stash box.  With perks, lets say 400 on you plus another 80 in your stashbox...
---
So, there is no effective limit.  Go wild.
---
I have allegedly never killed a sloth
---
Mexicans will ruin one if those things in a  single sitting.

The FPShooter mechanics are so clumsy, laggy and broken that I’m going to stay away.

When PvPing now I usually get frame drops, just walking, running, sprinting, and jumping around is clunky, changing weapons is not fluent, changing weapons sometimes doesn’t work and you’ll end up unarmed, the weapon wheel is very finicky, the timing on pressing buttons to reload or use a stimpack is very unforgiving with nothing happening if you press buttons too quickly after one another.
---
That’s about most of my gripes regarding PvP FPS. - PS4
---
I wish we could feed them. I am a cat person too and I wont hurt them in game either....
---
the anwser is reactive plates
---
I'm a melee build (didn't really decide on this until like... level 40/45, so now i'm redoing all my perks) that uses power armor for major battles/unknown areas/carry weight, but I also like 2 good guns with me as well: a long range, sniper-ish rifle, and a faster rate shotgun for when i need something quick.
---
Most of the time, I run with a Furious Grognak's Axe. I also carry with me an All Rise with 90% weight reduction, so it's literally nothing to carry. That's basically a back up in case the axe breaks and I haven't fixed it yet.
---
I do keep a couple heavier guns in my stash for nuke fights/scorchbeats/queen--it's been rotating, but some sort of gatling or a 50 cal as they seem to do the some of the best damage against them.
---
Not sure if my strategy is smart or not, but I am enjoying it. 
---
You killed it!
---
With grounded and fireproof they deal 0 damage to you.
---
Lemonade is acid, sugar, boiled water, and wood
---
Hard Lemonade is lemonade and vodka
---
I need you to do mine... I cant seem to ever get down below 650 or so no matter what I do!
---
Someone did this to me also. It was great!
---
Anti-Armour + Instigator + Bloodied Supersledge with Incisor and all the Slugger perk cards to boot. Chemmed out of his/her mind. Critical saved in VATS just to make you post this here. 
---
It works on those low health bloody builds but you both die.
---
In a world where cultural progress never got past the 50's, there 60's music.
---
So do you think it or the gamma would be useful? More or less than the radium rifle?
---
Parade isn't broken, just your expectations. 
---
Seems there’s some vast variation for these issues. It seems most pc users experience the issues, but console is sporadic. Are you Xbox 1x?
---
I spent most of tonight session. I'm down to 270ish on me and a full stash.
---
Need to try and sell some meds and junk tomorrow.
---
That means they're sharing perk cards with the team
---
This week I have been mostly dumping stuff on the floor at the end of the Parade.
---
Thumbs up and Hearts all round.
---
I feel u man. There’s def something addicting about 76.
---
Thanks will do
---
I am in the same boat, all 3* get saved and most 2* (nothing heavy).  Hopefully it pays off!
---
Sometimes they get bugged and can only respawn where they died and don't want to be one shotted again.
---
I suggest unyielding because high special points make vats, critical and sneaking crazy powerful. 
---
If the son of a bitch also dies, I'll be happy 
---
Wow, that is super easy to make, indeed. Gotta find that random encounter now! 
---
At least you can get tech data. They dont spawn for me anymore
---
Not populating a container with loot can be due to poor server optimization. The server takes its damn sweet time to calculate which item to generate. Sometimes that sweet time take a bit more than those few seconds.
---
Is it unreasonable to sometimes wait when a program hangs up? Is it unreasonable to wait on a video to buffer for some odd reason? Sometimes "but i want it now!" won't work. Checking a body later on for that missing legendary item is a tested and proved method. It would be folly if there wouldn't be anything in those dead bodies.
---
This is actually great. What is the uniform requirements? Do you have to have X0-1 PA?
---
Yeah same, I like to sit there creepily in a chair in the hopes they come back to their camp to a creepy clown or something, I just wish our name tags didnt show up above our heads constantly
---
Y'know, the other day, I was testing Steam In-Home Streaming with Fallout 4.  It works surprisingly well.  I turn on the radio and I'm having a good time.  Turn the volume up.  *And then Travis starts talking*.
---
All these hours of Appalachia Radio, with no DJ, made me forget how cringey and repetitive Travis was.  Just shut up, man, I want to listen to music.
---
It reminded me of the last time I did this test too.  I was in Railroad HQ and I'm walking around and everyone's spouting off the same lines I'd heard countless times by this point.  It really does pull me out of the game.  Everyone acts like an automaton, and as you point out, they might as well be automatons.
---
Lol. I do the same except I leave a bag of canned dog food, canned coffee, or other canned goodies.
---
PS4.
---
Got a stalkers explosive double barrel last weekend. So pretty much just an explosive double barrel.
---
I’ve mostly noticed FPS issues inside buildings, the outer world is fine with the exception of the ash heap weirdly. But for me it wasn’t so much low FPS as lagging look movement.  It’s still playable, disconnections and total crashes notwithstanding.
---
Same here but I think it's because we played the beta and it didn't count our progress to get the achievement
---
I'm not sure about other systems (I play on xbox) but I feel like the whole forced PvP on workshops has been blown way out of proportion. I've logged  over 500 hours in the game and have claimed workshops from the beginning.  In all that time I've only had my workshops contested 5 or six times. I don't care for PvP either, so I usually just let whoever is contesting it take the workshop. I've never had anyone trash my camp when I owned a workshop.  I've never had anyone track me down in world for the express purpose of simply killing me.  I'm not saying those things don't happen...I'm just saying they don't happen as frequently as posts might lead you to believe.  After all, no one posts "Hey guys I took over the Red Rocket workshop and absolutely nothing bad happened!  It was great!!".  No, people post about the problems and issues they have with them.  Which creates the misconception that these things are the norm rather than the exception.  And even if someone does contest your workshop and then starts giving you a hassle...simply log off the server and onto a new one.
---
Yes.  Prickett is just an easy one to hop at.  Low level area, no enemies in the place, etc. 
---
Watoga almost always spawns incomplete T45, T51 and T60 armor (at least one of each type at the same time).  There is one in the center of town, one behind a (lvl3) locked door in the transit center, one on top of the building next to the transit center (east of it), one on top of the building directly across the street (south of it), and one on top of the high school.  If the frames are all empty, check the two vendors because lots of people gather the components to sell to the vendors.
---
T51B spawn at Big Bend Tunnel East.  
---
I \*think\* T60 spawns on the 4th floor of Fort Defiance.
---
Damn it...now I have to figure out how to do that, too. 👍
---
I had to create another character after the Beta so I could get the Reclamation Day cheevo 
---
On the additional suicider waves:  that happened to me.  One of the bots got crippled and stayed in the area longer than normal and the suiciders did not stop until we finally missed one and it finished off the bot. 
---
I spend my time on the game changing my base, doing events and helping low levels. I'm only lvl 90 but I've completed everything, I've launched nukes, fought the SBQ raided bases and so on and so forth. Nothing brings me more joy than running up to low levels and offering bags of water, chems, ammo, and armor. More often than not they run away though. ): If you ever see my gt don't run or try to fight me just let ne pay it forward. 
---
What platform? You could play remotely on pc and xbox. Sadly ps is...well...its sony
---
Since lvl 50 is the max level on items, once you reach that level the only thing that gives you an advantage is your skill. He could have been grinding to get special gear since he left the vault.
---
Is it a public discord? Wouldn't mind attending some queens on pc.
---
Yeah, i agree
---
WORKSHOP PVP NEEDS TO BE IN THE WORKSHOP ONLY
---
Black Titanium deposited on the ash heap near to Lewisburg station .... I can rebuild but it won't save
---
I kind of like to look out on the WV horizon as I do my thing. "The sound of birds, the faint hum of a bloatfly, the whine/snarl of a hound, whatever the sound that snalygasters make, I hear the screech of scorch beasts... OH NO A SCORCHBEAST!!! I REMEMBER WHY I LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN NOW!!!"
---
and what happened after? was the final wave normal? the whole thing was like a low-level sbq battle for me. there was shit *everywhere.* even after the event ended we were still picking things off.
---
Cold Case is pretty good, but if you want tragedy, there's quite a bit to go around in random locations, just not as formal quests.
---
My calling card is a plasma core (half) but they dont notice so they think there is a lvl 100+ in there base so they panic and leave the game even though i'm lvl 34+
---
Lol not going to happen for me.  The wolves etc made short work of me and I failed the event.
---
I was there. You owned abandoned bog town. We killed you with full dmg because we contested your workshop, fast traveled to watoga station. We iced you while you were talking ro the vendor.
---
Really wish we had:
---
- Thank you
---
- I’m sorry
---
- Pointing “This/that way”
---
- Wait
---
- “Looks good!”
---
I captured the workshop hours ago about hasn't considered it, more fool me. That's on me. 
---
Ultimately I did try and grab what I dropped but y'all blocked my path and killed me again anyway. 
---
If you're on Xbox I have some Tick Blood Tequila you could have
---
If you're going to attack camps for bounty, attack the cheap to fix stuff like wooden railings and wood or steel walls.  
---
Wait... Can you repair the item after destroying it?  If so, destroy it and fix it.
---
 Hey thjs may be my favorite new sentence in the English language. 
---
Do u get those just for participating ? Or do u gotta be on the leader board?
---
You are right. I haven't tried pacifist can't remember what the middle of the road option is called, but that is what I'm using. When you wave at someone and they take a cheap shot at you that ends up destroying you before you can do anything is frustrating, but it feels like it fits in with the raider thing, but the people who camping at events seems so weak.
---
Could we please add contagious diseases that we can spread by sleeping in other people's camps? 
---
Remember when you used to be able to log out with a partially charged core and it would be fully charged when you logged back in?
---
Man those were the days.
---
Really wish we could build some sort of fusion core recharger in our camps. Not sure what I think would be a reasonable rate, but it would need to outweigh just server hopping and doing a run.
---
Also for OP: I follow this route, roughly, and find that with a few server hops, you can be well stocked up: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbLK42Y2\_Og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbLK42Y2_Og)
---
I will also echo Watoga as there are at least 4 easily accessible frames that you could grab one from (crashed vertibird, top of emergency services building, top of civic center , and behind a locked door (level 3 i think) in the transit center--that one has one in a fusion generator too so it is doubly worth it. This map might be helpful for you as well: [https://www.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia](https://www.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia)
---
most achievements (if not all) did not activate retroactively after launch if you played the BETA.
---
besides those, im having more of an issue with challenges not registering. i have things like "discover locales within the Mire" and the two locations that it wants me to discover are already discovered...
---
I have keypad switches on my camp doors and the code is written on the wall next to them so people can get in and out. Downstairs is the workshop space with attached power armour garage and there's a set of musical instruments upstairs for people to use, alongside a decontamination arch.
---
I've considered rebuilding it recently to downsize it slightly but it took me ages to get the conduits lined up properly and that's the only thing stopping me.
---
I don't mind other players using my camp - I don't even lock my water purifiers- I leave it accessible in the hope that someone won't instead smash the wall or doors down to get in. 
---
YOU SAID THE R WORD
---
The real victim here is the artist that made these cool looking masks which nobody gets to enjoy.
---
Same :( 
---
MGS wow going way back lol
---
Am I going crazy?? People keep saying fusion cores have been better but I still find them at 90% all over the place.
---
Just popped up on Xbox as well
---
Same 
---
im getting a failed to verify game thing on PC
---
I am having the same problem. 
---
same
---
PS4 and this was a while ago, but thanks brah.
---
I honestly cant wait until the legendary vendor i just have legendary weapons and armour sitting around
---
I feel like the era is a bit off. The Beach Boy's Pet Sounds came out in 1966. I feel like FO music tends more towards the 40s and 50s...
---
I'd counter that by saying that if we're talking about realism, none of the cities we see in Appalachia could possibly hold as many people as they claim.  Flatwoods claims a population of \~7,000 people.  Can you imagine 7,000 people in the dinky city we see in the game?
---
There's something very "scale model" about Bethesda's world design.
---
Cuz power armor sucks and you're out of tune with the meta.  
---
My hoarding for the Legendary vendor has ruined this for me.
---
Same PS4
---
I dont know. This will mainly be sniping though, maybe high fire rate CQC weapons.
---
It sounds like you neither understand dataminers nor are you familiar with the Creation Kit.
---
I've been thinking about the music in this game recently.  I don't think it works as well as it did in Fallout 3.  Even the same songs.  I'll tell you why, because I'm sure you're just dying to hear my opinion.
---
Fallout 3 was BLEAK and DARK.  Fallout 3 was a dry, barren wasteland full of things that could kill you at every step and people out to murder you for the sake of it.  Raiders.  Cannibals.  Slavers.  The colors were bleak.  Radiation was everywhere.  Your dog companion could die forever even if you put armor on him.  The world was depressing, sort of like the Toxic Valley section of Fallout 76 but more grim.  
---
And in the midst of all this was a bunch of cheery 50s songs.  The juxtaposition was what made it absurd.  It's black humor to hear *Dear Hearts and Gentle People* as you fight your way through a feral ghoul horde only to end up at someone trying to swindle you out of something.
---
In Fallout 76, the same style of music is used but there's lush trees and vegetation, streams, colorful stuff in much of the map, and the other players are mostly not trying to get one over you.  It makes the game more upbeat than the post-apocalypse oughtta be, I think.
---
Honeybear, I totally get what you’re saying about the Hitachi Massage Monster and the conga line of Michelin-Men-made-of-Greasy-Black-Turds, but I dunno’ if you’re followin’ my singular point about VATS and PvP.
---
If you’re chucking 40mm grenades at a Sentinel they’re probably gonna marsupial-jump their way to victory. Literally straight up-and-down hopping means half your shots might be wasted because the blast radius doesn’t reach the zenith of the hop. Not to mention, hitting an actual body-shot on your enemy with 40mm removes the area damage effect from the target.
---
I know you’d try to turn the odds in your favor by going straight at ‘em with your melee. But AA only cuts through Damage Resistance, and not the Damage Reduction modifier of Sentinel/Assassin, teams with Empaths, Lone Wanderer perk, etc. Only a VATS critical will ignore Damage Reduction.
---
On a side note, I never said your dislike of auto-aim was unfounded, or that you can’t play without VATS. And you don’t have to justify that preference to me.
---
I have photos of cats. Tons of them. Anybody wanna see some cute cats?
---
Same, on pc.
---
Confession: I joined a friend's game and put a bunch of uwu and owo everywhere around his base. Probably something around 25 total the first time around and I've put at least 1 more each time we play. He hasn't noticed yet, but I'm sure it won't be long with as many as there are
---
I think it’s just weekly survival challenges
---
Falls in line with the double spawns of squirrels and other creatures...
---
Likely just a failure with the authentication server.
---
phewww glad i found this, thought i got hacked
---
Ikr happens on Xbox too
---
I normally never have issues killing her. 
---
IDK, if I had a dollar for every player I've come across in full unyielding, sentinel, I would have quite a few dollars.
---
Same problem on pc
---
They could have a currency that is awarded that you can trade at a special vendor which lets you purchase an item. That will also help player economy with rare items because there will be a direct time value attributed to it.
---
MMOs (used to) do this and it lets you have a bit of control whilst working towards what you want. 
---
This post makes me sad. Without -weight perks I'd probably be at 1500+ pounds.
---
bloodied melee builds are insane. it could even be bobble head stacking - not sure if they fixed that. i can say that im confident that they did not clear out all duped bobble heads, that's for sure. had someone run up to me and offer me 300 explosive bobble heads at 100 caps a piece, as well as a couple explosive weapons.
---
after level 50, level doesn't matter. its all about perk loadouts and gear. you, level 80 completely naked, no perks and empty handed vs someone level 60 completely naked, no perks and empty handed is completely even. 
---
Will sell u mine. Message me an offer
---
Same on xbox
---
If only there was a mechanic in the game that generated new fusion cores... 
---
Thirded.  I've spent days wandering looking for this to no avail.  I have better luck running into Grahm.
---
Ill hook you up if you need something. Gotta do me a favor and smash 2 camps. Get a big bounty, join my gang and ill give you half the steel back.
---
I wanna see ya do it. Players gotta be home too. 
---
Run with the bad boys you will be getting scores like that everuly night. 
---
Same xbox
---
You have already crossed into forbidden territory but using the sentence 'poor server optimization'.
---
There are days where this is transgressive enough to be put to the torch.
---
But I digress; you were talking about middle grounds in your OP. Between 'I want it now' and 'I am going to hang around in this now empty area for an unspecified period of time in the hope that the container will populate regardless of the fact that in previous experiences it hardly ever did' surely there must be one of those middle grounds?
---
In my personal experience, which may not be extensive to anyone else, I am used to hanging around because I tend to use and abuse 'Pharma Farma', 'Can Do!' etc and immediacy and those perks do not go hand on hand however my success level with legendary drops manifesting 'later' is low, very low, and one could even go as far as saying 'discouraging'.
---
This seems to be cross platform issue, was there a update or server maintenance go on today? 
---
How am I supposed to get up with you if I dont know your gamer tag? I’m at work right now and I may not have time today so I may hit you up in the future via Reddit.
---
If you’re gonna try to open up a paint shop you’re gonna have to get over not giving out your GT. Maybe just don’t post it? Send it to serious buyers only through a direct message.

Everyone probably smells like shit in the wasteland so I'm sure it's a nonissue but at this point I assume you're just being pedantic because you don't like cigs. 
---
It's not an mmo because the servers would crash. I'm just saying more player would be a big improvement in my opinion 
---
Ikr i have 3 of them and i get confused on which one is which
---
Its good there isent a time limited event going on atm...
---
I have almost always had a good experience with the social aspect of the game as well, and I will gladly go out of my way to help people. I remember being level 1-10 and not having the gears to build all of my workbenches at my camp, so if someone struggling invites me to their party I'll plop down work benches, power armor stations, a fusion generator. Honestly it helps me too because I'm usually so over encumbered it's ridiculous lol. I also like to take them around and unlock the vendors for them, because getting that done on your own is near impossible at a low level.
---
I have had a couple people go out of their way to try and harass me when I take over a workshop or when I'm doing my vendor stop at Whitesprings, but my main can wreck just about anything with a standard combat shotgun, so I usually win. I always add them after though and some of the best people I've played with are the ones that were originally trying to grief me.
---
Here's to hoping the good vibes continue! I'm on PS4, so feel free to add me, ID is the same on both. I've always got some junk and the occasional off level legendary to give away.
---
Same on PC
---
I am one of those crazy loud people who goes around helping new players =)
---
Same on PS4
---
i got the same problem on pc right now as we speak,was playing got dced,and now wont let me back in game,asks me for credentials always when i type them in,it asks again for them,guess something is wrong with the servers
---
Haha, so we have! Points to us for being civil about it!
---
I'm not even sure why I care at this point, I don't even really want the other 5 masks that much...
---
It's because there's a disconnect between how spongey a player is in PvE versus the nearly "realistic" amounts of damage they take in PvP, which tends to be 1-2 shots, you're dead.  Which means to succeed in PvP, you have to have exemplary damage output, the skill to hit first, and perks that offer flat damage reductions.
---
Just waste all the big WS bots. They drop fusion cores when they die.
---
Same issue. I was able to get past that screen but now I get disconnected from server.
---
Same on pc...
---
Nah, springs is where is at. 
---
yup same here
---
The final wave was normal but I missed most of it. 
---
I also just started getting this error.
---
same on PC
---
I’ll do a group post on Xbox where EVERYONE can see it. I used to paint people’s power armors atomic shop but they unfortunately patched that 2 updates ago.
---
Seeing it on ps4 here.
---
And just let it sit in my quests forever? I don't think so. You have to do it because it's part of the game. That's just how it is. I'm just saying if I could say no, that would be cool
---
We're investigating, thanks for letting us know!
---
Ditto, PS4
---
This would be fine. Take all your progression in the story but no items with you
---
You can buy those off of most ash heap vendors. Chad at Camden Park for sure. 
---
I'm now getting a strange error code with zero info on it.
---
$LoginError_GameCodeFailure 
---
[3:0:7]
---
Help please
---
I honestly think it has a lot to do with how lonely this game is. There are hardly any NPCs or anything else to interact with. We need each other to succeed.
---
Yeah any idea what it is ? 
---
Im seeing multiple posts about this and am experiencing it too. I'd say it's prolly somn on bethesdas end
---
Same here on Xbox
---
That or the guy accidentally sold it and then didn't notice... 
---
Fuck it, so all the Gear i stored is gone. Thx BGS!
---
Yep same on xbox
---
We should put the priest robes to good use and have Chaplin assistant around the wasteland. And Bethesda should start doing safety briefs every Friday to cover their own asses. 
---
Sadly no :(
---
I got all my assassains and cavalier armor ready to go. I just recently spent all my caps and idgaf about my junk and aid items. I’m ready.
---
Same on PC. They must be having issues. No need to worry about your account.
---
Same here. "$LoginError_GameCodeFailure [3:0:7]"
---
Just happened to my killed 3 3* and a 2* and before I could loot them kicked me off -_- 
---
500 caps do it?
---
Achievements were not able to be earned during the BETA, so leaving the vault and reaching a certain level before the actual game came out results in no achievement's for the corresponding stuff. You'd have to make a new player to get the first two achievements that you have listed. I honestly couldn't tell you for the other achievements though.
---
Down on PS4
---
I know The Master is unique but holy hell is his talking head repulsive
---
Just sorted by new, guess everybody is affected. 
---
You all fully grasp what “rare” means right. Not everyone is going to get one or is entitled to one no matter how many runs you do. Just because you grind the event hundreds of times shouldn’t guarantee you a rare mask. 
---
Same here Xbox one. 
---
Haha I just got back into the game without playing for a few months and I’m having the exact same thing lmao, keep thinking about what I’m gonna do next, it’s definitely addicting lol
---
Y'all get so much shit but I just wanna say thanks for letting us know you and the team are on it. 
---
&gt;  When you wave at someone and they take a cheap shot at you that ends up destroying you before you can do anything is frustrating
---
That doesn't exist.  There is no "middle of the road option".
---
You're either in pacifist mode or not.
---
Whether you're in pacifist mode or not mode other players can only do "slap damage" which it has been repeatedly shown is very very unlikely to one-shot you.
---
If you're not in pacifist mode and you accidentally shoot someone  then you can enter full PvP mode at which point they can blow you away.
---
Pacifist mode just makes it so you can't accidentally shoot someone else.
---
(NOTE:  These rules change if you capture workshops).
---
Paint me like one of your French ghouls
---
FTFY
---
Let’s hope it’s a drop rate fix on masks lol
---
I honestly think the overseer's box is instanced to each player, the red toolbox on the bench isn't though. Could be wrong but the red toolbox is where I've been leaving stuff.
---
I have no door.
---
Someone left 6 legendaries from 1-3 stars in a cigarette machine at Whitespring Train Station. Better than any loot I've pulled anywhere else
---
I've had bad experiences the more I play lately
---
Like yesterday I was in a mission when two other guys joined in. Helped the whole way through but when mission was over they walked over and just clawed me to death no reason. Twice. Thought the first was a fluke.  I even play in passive mode so it's more obvious. 
---
I seem to run into someone like that about once or twice a week but also lots of friendlies that have been helpful and fun 
---
I did see two guys in impressive power armer right near there yesterday. I'm wondering if they were the same. I just ran though lol
---
Too many bad experiences lol
---
yeah its been a mess unfortunately
---
the only thing we really need in an online game is for the online part to actually function
---
It's really stupid to not have the option to defend the workshop or just abandon it.  I quit doing workshops when I found out about this.   This is by far the worst pvp system I've played in.  Defiance, ESO, destiny 2 all had better pvp.  There's nothing wrong with making it purely optional.  Then everyone can play how they want to. 
---
Ahhhh. Smart. I'm not sure I have those yet. Do conduits act as connectors? Powering nearby lights?
---
The improbability of getting any of those last five Fasnacht masks finally made all the servers explode from frustration. 
---
yup.  having it on xbox
---
Oh yay I'm not the only one
---
It seems servers finally crashed after a week full of lag and disconnecteable. 
---
Jesus...why does that sloth have a human head for genitalia?!
---
I am. Xbox. Just started about 15 mins ago
---
Yeah, but the vaults would take in people from farther away if they didn't have 1k people. They aren't bound to just the map of 76
---
Hope I run into you someday.
---
i’m glad that they communicate with us, immediately
---
Damn that sucks bro! 
---
You on pc ?
---
I thought update was today 
---
Try to have just enough for ur pay out the first time in and see what happens. I’m not sure either
---
I'm getting this on xb1
---
Yup im on xbox too
---
It's true - the way the game chooses your potential respawn locations is questionable at best.
---
It seems the servers are down across all platforms.
---
PLEASE tell us you guys are putting in a fix to make the other 5 Fasnacht masks obtainable...
---
Can only hope Lol, the drop rates for rare masks are damn right imposdible 
---
nop.... right now Bethesda lower down price of turrets so u can make rly great stuff with your camp...
---
Guess there were a few bodies at it last night so ;)
---
Same, PS4. Glad I found this thread, was about to panic. Tried restarting PS4 etc. Woke the PS4 up about 15 minutes ago to an error as well, possibly connected?
---
I enjoy touring camps that are designed to keep the public out, but that didn't plan for marsupial mutants. 
---
that term fits, i remember 3 weeks ago i played for 6 hours straight with no disconnects, twas glorious
---
I can confirm as well for the Xbox!
---
Don't they kind of fall hand in hand? I have slugger and martial artist currently 
---
How long you stay up last night writing this one out?
---
Lol you just named three primary prefixes. You can only have one of those on a weapon. But you were partly right, my guess is definitely on bloodied, instigating is unlikely as most people are never full hp due to small amounts of rads, and AA is good but not quite as good as bloodied for insane one shot damage.
---
I'd be cool if I didn't get server booted 8 out of the 12 times I finished the event.  :(
---
Running a company is about keeping your customers happy right? If it’s not a game changing item and just a purely cosmetic item why not make the collection OCD community happy ... they may purchase some atoms after
---
I think it now depends on where you find them.  
---
From what I have seen recently:
---
Inside a PA unit at a known spawn point: 25%.
---
In an ammo box, loose of a table/cabinet somewhwhere, or in a generator: random charge, usually 50% or better
---
Fusion core processor at a plant: 100%
---
Levels mean nothing in PVP.
---
Power armor means nothing in PVP.
---
You may have good gear but his was better.
---
Level 80 scorchbeasts are like blind 3 legged kittens compared to a PVP oriented player. Don't for a minute think you can compare the two.
---
I've been stuck on this one for days as well.  I've hopped to a bunch of different blast zones (I can't launch my own nukes yet) and the most I gathered was half the raw flux I need to make one - and then they spoil before I find any more.  Super frustrating.
---
Don't you need a window to be able to place and enter the power armor through a wall?
---
If so I think mine might present a challenge lol. No gaps, no windows, and a keypadded garage door.
---
As u level up u get more budget for ur camp. I’m not sure what level it caps at tho
---
and you are why I DON'T lock my doors.. 
---
I have no interest in breaking other people's things or giving anyone a hard time. And I know full well that 1.5k steel, or ~1/2 of what I was carrying, isn't considered valuable. I like to spend most of my time crafting and camp building so I find most junk useful. 
---
Also scraping guns for plans leaves you with a lot of steel. 
---
&gt;The Mistress of Mystery Quest .... just brilliant!
---
Did you notice the terminal message from our FO4 friend Kent Connolly?
---
Or we just prefer playing console? 
---
Go with the garage door and keypad, lockpicking doesn't help them.
---
50 I believe
---
How long you stay up last night missing this irony? 
---
Non-existent is more like it...
---
Same for me ps4 
---
If you Google “Fallout 76 Nuke Codes” this website called fallout builds always has each weeks nuke codes! 
---
 &gt;Between 'I want it now' and 'I am going to hang around in this now empty area for an unspecified period of time in the hope that the container will populate regardless of the fact that in previous experiences it hardly ever did' surely there must be one of those middle grounds?
---
I usually farm whitesprings. If i start at the golf club and there are no drops i'll just do a full rotation. By the time i get back to the golf club the bodies without any drops are now populated. It takes little to no time at all to recheck the bodies since i was doing the full whitesprings rotation anyway. I'm not willing to sit near the corpse and wait either. Sometimes it really won't drop anything. 
---
I hope this is an acceptable middle-ground for you. Things aren't perfect and i do hope they'll improve.
---
&gt;in previous experiences it hardly ever did
---
In my previous experiences it's a really common occurrence.
---
eyoy
---
This and also maybe because a lot of people came back recently.
---
Maybe the stability was just an impression because less people were playing the game...
---
Yes, I agree I saw that as well.
---
same here on PC ,rebooted launcher same issue, trying a scan and repair
---
The 50% less dmg I saw on a YouTube video. Not to plug the dude but I think it was ragecronicals. I would test it but I've never be sub 1k caps since early beta. 
---
I wish I knew more about CELL records etc because in the esm I seem to find indications that these blooms can occur elsewhere, not just in that stretch of river next to the chemical plant.
---
Alas I come sorely short in this particular department; as such I cannot work out what these areas are and under which conditions the wretched things bloom.
---
Until/unless RadShield is patched I would love to have a steady source for these.
---
i put some of the lighted arrows on a tree by my house to point toward my CAMP for passersby, but they seemed to have fused the the tree and are now unselectable
---
its been weeks like this, no matter what i do i cant seem to select them to move them or delete them
---
i guess they are just part of the scenery now fo rbetter or for worse
---
That s just crazy... i  ve been trying for like 4 hours than it started  
---
the game does not want to start anymore after those ridiculous masks drop rates  
---
Fix your game
---
Yikes, I can't live without my Blackbird paint...
---
They did say it was prototype power armor. 
---
You can't sell/transfer Atomic Shop items. They can only be used by the original buyer.
---
Yes, usually play after 5pm during the week.
---
Oh thank gorp. I was worried my roommate got me banned or something.
---
Refund after 200+ hours of game? Kinda impossible. I'm not a fanboy of Beth or FO, didn't play FO4, Skyrim...
---
Played FO NV and FO3, NV is my favorite (and not developed by Beth), had it issues, but it was really fun, I played it on a PS3 and I didn't have any major issue.
---
But I get what you're saying. This revolution of yours is suggested since when EA and Ubisoft weren't the shit they are today, I mean, the whole gaming industry pretty much, and yet, even tho it's been suggested for years now, here we are.
---
Do you have the brahmin pen?
---
Ok my XBX1 gamer tag is  **WAYNESTATON**   what is your gamer tag and I will add you for later today.
---
I forgot that, damn. 
---
I'll have to give a look for that
---
It's almost like you and I are the same person.
---
I used to drop propaganda flyers too, but I've changed that for the Free Watoga flyers.
---
Couldn't agree more, why did Bethesda go to the effort of creating them if no one can obtain them.
---
I've done the event 30+ times and others have done them 100+ and no one has got them.
---
[Punji](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punji)
---
Idk I went to be at 11pm for the first time since I was 15.
---
Remember: DONT FINISH THE EXCAVATOR POWER ARMOR QUEST UNTIL YOU GET THE RECIPE
---
If you do, you’re locked out of the recipe
---
Okay man, that’s a good idea. Good luck to you! 👍🏼
---
&gt;Valseek
---
lol
---
At least the ones in PA spawns have all been 25% for me, when pre-patch-7 they were variable. 
---
The Punjab boards hurt you too though? How did he use his own base?
---
aww man ima delete this post now
---
Wait i just thought that box refilled from  time to time.
---
Logged on thanks Bethesda
---
Exactly 
---
Holy shit I thought I was the only one. I only noticed the empty holes on their backs after doing Fasnacht and that shit makes my skin crawl.
---
There sould be subtitle for everything that speaks. I swear, I can never tell what Biv is saying lol
---
And I'm sure if they posted here it would be a long 4 paragraph post about how a red eyed demon stalked them and just kept slaughtering them for hours and how they are reporting them for hate and unfair gaming.
---
At first I used to believe their crap now I see they blow it out of proportion. But none of them simply just block and leave server no they cry about change and unfair. And now i foresee these assholes building camps with ton of turrets around points. Causing frame problems and stealing kills from players. And no one can do shit.
---
They don't if you're in sneak mode 😘
---
Nah, you can miss me with that noise. 
---
People on reddit are in different time zones. My ign is the same as Reddit add me and I’ll come to you if I am online 
---
just manually log in 3-4 times, it worked for me.
---
No, but mine would be about 1000 caps
---
C00kthemrox 
---
PVP mode is Survival mode
---
I got a full one off a regular scorched the other day. Not a pa guy though when farming and there's a couple perks which make them drain so slow (I carry around 2).
---
Can you craft ultracite fusion cores? Not sure if you can put those into pa anymore, but you might try that too.
---
I noticed this too and the cards are readily available from air escort there. 
---
Those still take up workshop space, I'm surprised he hasn't seen them yet
---
I can’t even begin to imagine how much I’ve spent. I know if fast travel was free I’d be too rich.  
---
There are location achievements in every zone that will not pop for me on a character that never visited them during BETA.
---
Oops! Sorry. Thanks for correcting me on that.
---
No, stash contents are sacred. Always store junk before picking a fight you might lose.
---
Thats rad, hey odd question but does your family own an auto parts store?
---
Just kill someone and get the caps back 
---
You are right, it was been accepted there was a change that was not part of the patch that borked up the expiration speed of food and water stuffs
---
its sucks for people like me that eat soup instead of use stimpacks
---
so far Bethesda has not acknowledged it or the recent deterioration of server stability
---
Well maybe whatever it was just sputtered out the rest of the way and they'll get it sorted now. I can't log on at all right now.
---
Same on Xbox and getting 'disconnected from server' messages whenever trying to join a world. I just kept re-trying until it finally let me in.
---
We were completely immune as long as we were on his team. It didn't affect any of us.
---
Biv has subtitles for me
---
Also the way PvP works in this game helps. People can’t spawn kill you and troll your base hard. All it takes is an ignore or server hop to get rid of the troll. 
---
Lol. Wanted, dead or alive. What with the cost of housing prisoners though, the use of lethal force has been authorized. The warden's targeting systems have been a little wonky lately, but I don't have time to fix that right now. I must stop those escapees!
---
Same here, got the game on release date and I've played the game almost everyday since I got it.
---
I even got other great games at Xmas like Red dead2 and God of war but I've hardly been on them, I prefer to play fo76 over these
---
Travel agent is a must. It’s pain switching it every time u FT but it saves a lot in long run 
---
Yep it’s super useful, and no haha. 
---
😭
---
Even the owner of the camp? Mine always hurt me too, that's why I never used them.
---
They can't ban you for logging out and logging back in.
---
Especially when they designed content that revolves around server hopping.
---
You know that stretching bug  from getting out of power armor? You could easily repurpose that for becoming a Wendigo. 
---
You can go [here](https://outage.report/fallout-76) for the status report for some reason other websites are better than the actual bethesda website
---
I just got an executioners explosive lever action last night. Getting geared up for survival.  I run melee as well and think I’ll be fine. Maybe use it as backup.  
---
Sneaking up with melee is devastating 
---
I’ll try both! Thanks
---
Ok, I'm off to do some real-life work, back on some time tonight. But before go I figured I would propose a few things and see what you think about it:
---
You can pull my list right off the thread I referenced in the original post, and see everything I have, including the locations you previously gave me, which I have already retroactively added to it. If you make me a list of yours as well I can check it against mine, identify what is different, and then start combining lists. 
---
I have been trying to add very descriptive locations for each stash that would allow anyone to find them, even without Fortune Finder, or much familiarity with the game. I reference them to fast travel targets, compass bearings, objects around them, etc. I plan to do this for every stash.
---
After that is done I want to separate them by region (Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap, Mire, Savage Divide, Cranberry Bog) and list them from North to South in their region to make cap runs easy.
---
When that's done, I'll make a mock-up post for you to review before I release it (crediting you as my co-author and great help for the project, of course), and after we both proofread and agree on it's contents I (or you!) will post it.
---
I propose we release it at 6:30pm Eastern time on the day we decide to go ahead to get the maximum English-speaking views from Reddit users. 
---
I know we will miss some, so we should encourage users to update the post with new locations that we can add in as they get found.
---
We should also add "Stashes per biome/region" and "Total Stashes" counters to the post, as well as figure out the rough average number of caps per stash (I did a small sample size and got \~60, but I can do better with data from a massive run or two all averaged together.).
---
\^Take a think on this stuff and tell me what you would like done. :)
---
I understand this post is a little old, but if you are still having this issue, validating the game files worked for me after I was unable to re log from the game menu. 
---
If you are unsure how to do this, go to Game Options on the launcher and then select the Scan and Repair option. It takes a few minutes and I wish it gave you any corrections it could have done, but it doesn't. Happy gaming! 
---
Really. I guess I need to check my setting again. I get no subtitles at all.
---
They only play dead hoping the best would leave them
---
I've been RPing my cannibal character as turning into a wendigo. She randomly got the carnivore mutation, and a perk pack had granted a cannibal card, so when Rose asked her to eat that ghoul she plugged her nose and went for it. Something changed that day.
---
The rule I play with is if I get parasites, I'm not allowed to cure them. I have to hunt until the hunger goes away.
---
Oh just checkin. I used to know a JT Murray so i was just wondering 
---
I just got to log in. hope its good for everyone now. 
---
After level 50, everything is fair game 
---
People. Just people
---
That too. But I have found people leaving stuff there too so I add chems, fusion cores, and a host of other stuff, hoping it finds someone in need
---
If you are trying to avoid PvP, you don't want them.  They initiate PvP on slap damage.
---
I usually like to friend them and see what's up though. One guy was only trying to kill me repeatedly (and losing horribly) because someone that had been on my team wrecked his workshop. I had no idea, so I helped him rebuild it. Now we're friends.
---
You're right.  Sorry about that.  I am in TX, so CST time zone.  Thanks for the offer.  I'll give you a shout if I see you online.  
---
Np, just don't want to see your resources wasted.
---
I have the exact same problem with discoveries not registering. Also cooking plans. Never played in the beta. 
---
Same here ps4 I’m glad I’m not the only one since last time I couldn’t play for days due to an errore that made the game  crash every time I tried to log in I can’t ever play jeezzz there is always a problem 
---
I've never actually seen the paints, since I don't have a T-60 to paint myself.  I have up to Paladin, (PS4 unfortunately).  The only pictures I can find are from Fallout 4 though, I think.  Paladin/Elder seem to be a dark grey with orange/red on it though.
---
Can you put the dog helmet on it? If so I have like 3 of those XD
---
I had the same thoughts recently for things like refrigerators, wardrobes etc but it would basically be like having multiple stashes and I’m not sure if that’s really possible without affecting the current stash limit? Unless they would have low weight limits themselves, idk
---
Maybe:
---
•refrigerator 35 LB Food stash limit
---
• wardrobe/dressers 20 LB apparel stash limit (clothing only armor would stay in main stash as it weighs more)
---
That's so awesome.  I love hearing stories about this.  I cringe hearing about the sub lvl 50s getting killed by higher lvl players because pacifist mode is off and they accidently shoot something or someone.  I know I struggled to get what I needed at first.  It's so great to hear the opposite when players help one another.
---
I think I might be in pacifist, but can't remember. What is the mode where you can't get into PVP until you hit someone and they hit back or if they hit you and like you said do slap damage unless owning a workshop.
---
Living saint! NEW OBJECTIVE ARRIVES!!!
---
Honestly it should give alot of radiation, iirc the amount of radiation taken by a smoker's lungs are equivalent or higher, to people who work on the ISS without an atmosphere to protect them from solar radiation.
---
Again last time was a PS4 cose  error for me that made the game crash it’s impossible to play there is always a problem I just wanna play for God’s sake 
---
Yep, Xbox
---
Bahahahaha, you thought the SpongeBob meme was serious xD lol
---
No problem.  We have a crack team of pedants ready to go at all hours of the day.
---
i agree, id like everything to be darker in game, its like the nighttime isnt even dark outside
---
tv slider to make it dark isnt the same
---
So.. Do you want to Cranberry ironyshine for your daily?
---
Gas mask protection with no -Perception effect is a bonus.  I keep mine on constantly.
---
They gave us an Appalachia radio radio. Jukebox went into the scrapheap.
---
This happened to me last night as well.  Xbone. They took my work shop, I did nothing to instigate.  Then I got a message from one of the members saying they were going to take my other shops.  I asked if it was because of spite. The guy said yes, and that he was leaving them.  Im glad some people are still good. Shoutout to Badazz! Hope you enjoyed the charred SB liver. 
---
but you're referring to challenges, right? the challenges issue isn't a BETA problem, though it's existed since then. had a daily once that said "pick any kind of flora" or something like that. literally picked everything i could find and it didn't register any of it. even tried raw flux.
---
I was referring to the BETA in regards to the issue with the actual achievements/trophies for your platform.
---
OP which platform are you on? I will give you 5 good/rare plans and 500 caps if you can break into mine within a set hour (with vague clues only to it's location - photos of nearby landmarks) - I think it is impossible to reach in normal circumstances.
---
If they run the event 40+ times yes they should get a rare mask.
---
 Not everyone will do that so not everyone will have a rare mask.
---
I frequently break into people's houses on my pacifist farmer character and leave them pies and booze. Enjoy the cobbler and Nukashine folks.
---
Definitely in Morgantown. I want to say it was in the VTU main building itself, but I forgot exactly where i picked it up.
---
PC :/
---
I have been wanting to help another player but I've been in my own personal jam
---
Nope.
---
I am in Power Armor most of the time for those areas that need it
---
From someone who (successfully) farmed the long coat...depending on your luck and schedule, clear out a few days in your schedule.
---
I farmed the event, and got the vendor to show up around 15 times before the coat was there.  Some days I could spawn him 4-5 times, some days 1-2 (I only play a couple hours in the evening most days).  He showed up maybe 1 in 15 restarts on average I think.
---
You could get lucky and find it quicker...but you could take many, many days.
---
Soften the blow a bit by farming the Grafton monster just over the bridge.  15-20 caps per, plus lots of acid and a few low level plans.  By the time you realize you'll get too bored to stick it out, you'll have made enough to afford buying the coat from someone else ;-)
---
Right I wasn’t disagreeing with anything you were staying, just expanding on it. 
---
I also went to bethesda's twitter and they said that the worlds mega servers are down and up for maintenance 
---
I'm trying my hardest dad 
---
I have my rad suit on my favorites wheel just in case. I had this happen when I was server hopping for x01 shocks often and it saved me a few times.
---
Only Atom Shop ones i have are Hot Rodder and Garrahan. But i do have both Nuka suits as well. Waiting for the display option, then ill actually make one of every variant, including every BOS T60. Hopefully when it happens, displaying one wont cost too much budget, as that would be like 20+ armors. I have enough trouble decorating as is because im the type to maximize my build limit to the point i have to be picky with furnishings 😂
---
Similar but reversed.
---
About a month ago I helped out this baby-ish player, about 30. He was starving and diseased and asked if he could take a few plants from the garden because he was hungry. 
---
No, you can have this whole bag of fresh cooked and prewar food and waters to last you a while. And here's some disease cures to help you along. 
---
He asked if I was sure. I said yes, the wastes are tough, we gotta help each other.
---
He messaged me a few days ago and let me.know he's doing a lot better and is over level 90. I told him to come home anytime he wanted a hotmeal. 
---
Wait so they're actually recipes and not in the plans section?
---
&gt; What is the mode where you can't get into PVP until you hit someone and they hit back or if they hit you and like you said do slap damage unless owning a workshop.
---
That's the mode known as "Fallout 76".  When "Survival mode" is added it will be renamed "Adventure mode" and the slap damage will be reduced from "tiny" to "zero".
---
In "pacifist mode" there is no difference in what others can do to you, but you can't accidentally slap someone else, so you can't accidentally enter into combat with anyone else.  You seriously want to be in pacifist mode for shared events like Fassnacht.
---
Nice, will do thank you.
---
I'm sure there is a pc mirroring app to play remotely on your phone
---
Shit. Well I hope it's fixed by the time I get off work. 
---
Seems a waste when running around a test mine in Ash Heap or a few spots in Mire that require just simple gas protection.  I think the only time I really use Power Armors these days are Nuke Zones and Silos.
---
My biggest 'miss' rates are Harper's Ferry and Wes-Tek. If a legendary enemy does not drop a legendary item is highly unlikely it ever will.
---
I haven't done a WS 'loop' for donkeys.
---
My highest 'hit' rate however is 'Monster Mash'. In this case I experience the same behaviour you describe about WS.
---
I can do one round quickly emptying mob containers as they are felled - 'loot hygiene' is key here - then revisit the surviving piles between rounds and chances are if the mob was meant to drop a legendary (or candy for that matter) it will be there.
---
Maybe is a ghoul thing? I don't know.
---
My C.A.M.P. is in a nice quaint spot (south of the Overseer's Camp near an abandoned shack, right next to a pond)
---
The only mobs that attack it: a few bees, a molerat or two and the odd scorched will fire from very far away. 
---
I received a notification when my C.A.M.P. was being attacked, but it was another player (when I got there, he was gone). I don't think the game prompts you if it's an NPC (if they do prompt you, I haven't noticed it). 
---
Basically, if you find mobs are pwning your C.A.M.P. you may need to find a new spot (that is, if it happens frequently enough that it's a problem). Sometimes I'll come back and my generator was destroyed, or one wall is gone - nothing major. 
---
Yeah I’m with you on the playability. Only once did I lose my rag a little and give up, with 4 or 5 connection drops within 15 minutes or so. It was late thankfully so I thought fuck it, bedtime.
---
I’ve noticed picking things up is slow, I’ve been sweeping the parks floors for cups the last few days. Sloooooowwwww.
---
I got AAE Shotguns and a Handmade. No bugs on those weapons.
---
Yep. I've even had it where I killed a critter, got infinite loading, and a few minutes later it was empty. So frustrating.
---
One good rhythm to get in the habit of is to claim a workshop when you log in and build all extractors available in resources to help you stock up on components. Another is to construct a fertilizer producer and corn, mutfruit, and tato plants as well as a water purifier and razor grain. You can use them to make vegetable starch at your chemistry station which scraps for adhesive, plus the razor grain and fertilizer let you repair and make alcoholic beverages once you complete the wasted on nukashine quest near vault-Tec university. You’ll get exp for crafting stuff, and the green thumb, chemist and super duper perks allow you to abuse it for extra yield which you can always bulk and sell.
---
Same.  Appalachia radio all day, every day.
---
I was secretly hoping that that's what the fasnacht stein receipts were for lol.  I think I have around 88 of the excellent ones.  I dropped all the poor and average ones.
---
I have wondered about that.  Either all the haters went to other games because the bought the bad hype, or all the anti-griefing elements both drove them off and made them post over the top bad reviews because they couldn't stand it.
---
I mean seriously.    I have had several people try to grief me, and it just tickles.  Imagine how frustrating that would be if that's how you got your thrills.
---
Anyway, yesterday I helped out a low level guy building his first camp (from the looks of it...  a lot of neat things but done with all low level plans right by the superviso'rs camp).  Was fun!
---
Check their twitter. That’s how I found out about the servers being completely down a few days back.
---
I think the best place is Morgantown. I found a lot of blue flux plants to the southwest of the town (and a fair amount of violet flux there and by the farm where they send you in the biv quest to get razor grain).
---
&gt;If they run the event 40+ times yes they should get a rare mask
---
Lose the entitled attitude. Just because you run it a bunch does not make you deserving of anything.
---
You can farm power cores at the plants why not run all the time lol
---
Super weird
---
And cash registers
---
Right?!
---
It is a survival game... The game is literally themed around you surviving after a nuclear apocalypse 
---
Also stacking PA on top of eachother, then you have to jetpack down to pick up the bottom one and fly back up to keep leap-frogging the stack upwards.
---
This mutation would make sense and should totally change your characters appearance. Not only that but radiation should also slowly turn you into a ghoul if you don’t treat it fast enough... and maybe even feral after a while. But I guess once you’ve become feral your character would be unplayable.  
---
We have 2 PS4's. Both are receiving the same code as well here in US
---
The Lake just south of the water park has a lot of Blood Leaf. Nuking those turns into a large amount of Cobalt Flux.
---
yeah it sucks, it was so solid before the last patch
---
I do exactly this same thing only instead of stranger's camps I sneak into my friend Jon's house and instead of stealing from him I use the small metal letters to write "JON SUX FARTZ N BUTTZ" on the wall in his living room. 
---
How many should I take? I could carry about 12 will I need more?
---
Ah dude 200hrs? You are my new hero, nobody has hope. like you do, if you find fun enough to put 200hrs into it then man their is no way I can argue with that. Beth is not bad or Zen, my peev is the delivery man its such a shame. When we see a fire we know their is smoke and when see a caution sign we know to focus but when Beth makes a game we knew their was going to be a really good game. So this is a shoker beyond the chair you know, they dont usually do this bad, why such desperation to bring this one out as they did? Maybe Todd was going to get fired and he paniced who knows what happened. Still hope it does get better man you deserve it, just anyother that has played it for so long. 
---
yeah its super balanced, honestly cant wait for survival mode so they can just @#$@@$ patch out all PVP from adventure already
---
cant sneak in a chair though unfortunately
---
Having almost 3x otherwise max SPECIAL is just excessive, it will be nerfed I agree and I will still be running this build regardless
---
I think you misunderstand the word entitled.
---
I'm not asking for free handout or do I think I deserve one.  If you run an event 40-50 even a 100 times and don't get one single rare drop there is something drastically wrong with the drop rates.
---
 I have run the event over 70 times at 20 minutes per run. I put in a lot of effort and work for very little to no reward.
---
On a side not has anyone seen my cat?
---
Nice!
---
He shows up at my base about once every few weeks it seems. I'll hear something weird, see him, and then he instantly flies away. Always the same spot of my base, no laamps by him or anything. Always way to fast for a screenshot or a laser blast!
---
He seems to fly away either when you get too close, or when you have line-of-sight. I have sneak maxed, including the one that lets you theoretically run without being detected.
---
Hasn't happened since my conference with the wise moth-man at the lighthouse event...
---
&gt; the dead survivor (~~raider?~~ responder) right outside of Vault 76.
---
Sorry to hear that snowflake.
---
Enjoy your witch masks
---
I’ve never seen a 3* farming watoga, I like the whitesprings golf club, not uncommon to see 2 3* on one run
---
I think ultra rare items are fine, but putting them in a short time event doesn't always work. I would like to see that some people have got them even if it's not me. You want to give people reasons to keep playing, so there should be some hope of a drop during the event. Fortunately the standard masks, camp items, and recipes have been enough to keep me coming back for this one. Perhaps in the future very rare items could also be added to the loot tables of event enemies, just to increase the chance a little bit.
---
To follow . If my job made me work 60 hours a week and threw me a handful of peanuts you think I would work there the next day?
---
 So drop your high all mighty attitude will ya
---
My spot is perfect for me. I'm near a cliff edge near whitesprings. I have a cement wall that blocks the only pathway for critters or the occasional ghoul. It's really only the random SBs that spawn on occasion. Honestly if I got the notification I would probably just server hop and not bother but I was right in the middle of it when I got back to camp. I haven't been hit by SB in weeks so it's not really anything bad. 
---
Idk, it sounds like you take the words of internet randos you don't even know over the developers who actually have access to player data. Anyone can say they're a dataminer and claim shit about the masks. 
---
It is story consistent to get/give help...  I usually just drop some purified water, excess plans, and some food.  You have to eat/drink a ton at the beginning.  If they have a camp, I might whip them up some tweaked out leather armor, gun, and machete.  You can feel free to ignore it.  I drop, wave, and leave.  No worries.
---
The hotbox perk let’s you smoke in power armor but also means you have to smell your own farts trapped in said armor. -1 perception. 
---
For a while I’ve been using a two shot missile launcher myself. Just last night I got an anti armor one at whitesprings so I’m going to try some tests to see how they compare.
---
I use a targeting computer on my two shot and will put it on the AA one for consistency.
---
Interestingly when free aiming the two shot, you can sometimes see the second missile. When locking on, I don’t physically see it. Maybe they clip together due to the lock on but it does shoot two. 
---
I want to compare the damage between the two shot and anti armor and see what’s the most effective. I suspect there’s more going on behind the scenes with two shot that the damage screen doesn’t show. But maybe anti armor will prove more effective. We’ll have to see
---
It would certainly help ! especially is said event is "limited to a week time"
---
yeah bethesda is taking their sweet time getting this MOST REQUESTED thing patched in
---
99% of the players want our houses to be immune to damage in adventure mode
---
I defend Bethesda a lot but damn it if they dont weem to be catering to the 1% youtubers and streamers who love to post griefing videos
---
Did u just start playing RN? They just shut down the servers for a few. Maybe it’s hotfix?
---
Clunky, feels much nicer out of the armor.  Even though I am carrying 20 100% cores, I still prefer out of the power armor.  
---
True, true
---
No matter what we call it. its a return to base game with the bugs fixed and some bribes to get player interested.
---
I want to know how to do that now lol
---
You made sure to send them friend requests, right? Next time it can be three people running up instead of two. :D
---
Wait, this is in game? How do you use it?
---
Ah okay makes sense, yeah SBs never head where my base is, but I'm near the start of the game - wouldn't be very much fun emerging from Vault 76 into a sonic-scream haha. 
---
Fast travelling clears it also.
---
I understand that's incorrect?
---
Yeah, If you are higher level then you usually don't have a lot of low level stuff on you.  Just food and water.
---
Sorry to hear about your D baggery.  There's a douche flute in every crowd. Congrats!
---
This wins comment of the day right here. I got quite a chuckle. 
---
And yeah I’m down 30ish pounds doing the same thing. It’s insane how much sugar is out there. In the real world. I never seem to have an easy time finding sugar in game when I want it. 
---
Yeah depends on location low level areas I run without armor
---
since the first days :-D
---
but since paper bags are dropped mainly this feature is not well known
---
Found it, thanks for the tip!
---
&gt; it needs to go back to the way it was.
---
No it doesn't.  You'd like it to go back to the way it was.
---
Does he give you a new one if you haven't finished the last? I'm enjoying his daily quest but one glitched on me and won't let me complete it.   
---
&gt;game does not want to start anymore after those ridiculous masks drop rates
---
wut?
---
It's  a tree i zoomed in
---
that's not what OP ios saying, nor what anyone who has a coherent argument is saying. all OP is calling for is for our efforts to be considered alongside the already present RNG. not everyone is going to run the event 50+ times, and even then, OP is still proposing substantial RNG. all they are saying is that it is ridiculous that efforts aren't considered, and instead it is an astronomical gamble across the board.
---
we have a small, quiet friendly and helpful discord if you are on PC and would like friends to play with ... we like to help, and adventure and do quests and events , very laid back https://discord.gg/Q3Urjre
---
i cant wait to you go to survival and leave people alone
---
Thank you reddit.   Getting error 3:0:1407374883553289 on Xbox currently.
---
Was in the game and then booted.
---
Damn sucks, it might be do to so many ppl server hopping maybe, it has definitely gotten worst as the event comes to an end. 
---
Yet you still run the events for a virtual peanut which technically isn't your even if it drops.  Why?
---
Do the events around the map. A lot of em have legendary bosses in them
---
Really? They can't login and you take the opportunity to ask about those damn masks lok. Reddit needs to let the mask thing die. They are rare. If everyone got them then they wouldn't be rare.
---
I'm over level 80 now and I still have yet to see a megasloth even once.  Or a behemoth.  
---
I think it should definitely be an option. More accessibility features would always be nice!
---
Obviously they've been doing a handstand and shooting their fecal matter into orbit at speeds that break the sound barrier. That's what's been causing the servers to shake even when there are no Deathclaws or Nukes going off nearby.
---
I've never seen that! Is there also a decline option when someone requests an item from you?
---
Out of all the trades I've done I can honestly say I have never seen this.
---
I have a spare of that plan, if you still want it?
---
yeah its so great only CHEATERS/DUPERS get the good rewards for this event
---
if i ever see someone wearing one of these masks im reporting them and following them to their CAMP and using a orbital strike
---
Its been there since the begining.
---
Exactly my point, lvl difference will be great so it wouldn't matter if we carry our old character or not. The result will be the same. 
---
Have you ever searched before shitposting? 
---
It's not Deezer is it?
---
Yep.
---
I am very sure I don't have MODs. I did a video via my PS4 to youtube this morning before work but I dont see it up yet or I didnt do it right. I showed my stash and my inventory and then went to mod the x-01 and showed that I had all the lamp modifications available for just using ingredients. Plastic etc. Currently using the red lamp and love it. Problem is I don't remember how I got the plans if thats how I indeed obtain them. I have a feeling its a bug or I was treasure hunting and just not paying attention.
---
a KenHELL?
---
It's the height that attracts them I assume. But I think that having a high level character spawns them too. But I've never encountered 3 in a pack outside of a fissure site tho. 
---
I wanted to relocate for a change of scenery but I really like that spot cause it's quiet 95% of the time. And it's about the middle of the map for fast travel. 
---
they aren't saying they want everyone to have it or that anyone is entitled to anything. can you read? the post is not suggesting the removal of RNG, just a slight boost to those putting in the effort. hardly anyone is doing ~10 runs, let alone 50+. saying that *everyone* would be *handed* one is a gross exaggeration. you shouldn't be handed or guaranteed a mask for hundreds of runs, but at the very least your efforts should be recognized. OPs suggestion/model still leaves substantial room for RNG. the percentages aren't wild and it would be completely reasonable to slightly boost odds for those putting in the effort.
---
That's the implication
---
Because they wanted the $$$ from the PvP players. They sold both PvE and PvP players a crock of shit which led to two communities in the same server who hate eachother. 
---
The PvE lie: *You can completely opt out of PvP* 
---
The PvP lie: *Its a PvP enabled game, you can be as bad or good as you want to be. Players are the raiders!*
---
Well you cant completely opt out of PvP unless you server hop whenever an unkown player comes near you... Sounds fun right? 
---
And if you PvP theres a big obstical... Players server hopping, pacifist mode, etc. How are raiders supposed to know who wants to PvP? You know how much time raiders waste approaching people who just server hop? Or understand pacifist mode and avoid the damage? Not to mention half the community now hates you, for doing something you were told was allowed. 
---
Now all the raiders and PvEers are nasty to eachother... All becasue Beth launched the game in one server rather than 2...
---
Survival mode is tommorow though!!!!!
---
This reminds me of the scene from Resident Evil 2 where the Licker is crawling on the church ceiling.
---
Take a nap before you do an XP run.  It boosts XP gained, IIRC
---
Because the game is fun. I enjoy seeing all the people together having fun.
---
 Enjoy seeing everyone's outfits and the masks they're wearing.
---
 I'm going to wager a guess that you are the opposits and you try to ruin everybody's fun when you play video games.
---
 Playing video games is all about fun having a non existent drop rate is absolutely rediculous.
---
Or maybe... Just maybe... It's just people who were lucky?
---
When I got eye of Ra and Blade of Bastet at level 25 I 3 hit killed a 170 in X-01 while defending the Steel Works. PA is great for PVE and Nuke Zones, but you will be at a disadvantage when facing even basically outfitted PVP players.
---
Have you been hanging out in the Ash Heap?
---
I've slept in your bed. I've never not had radworms
---
It’s going to be a rad-rage build and other one hit kill build paradise 
---
Beach boys would make more sense if this was Fallout California lol But I do agree it doesn’t sound right. They should just stick with songs from the 50s...and maybe more then just 5 songs cuz unless every single radio station and music store were burnt to a crisp I’m betting there were a wide variety of songs the good people listened to prewar.
---
I remember that scene. That was kinda scary too.  
---
Crazy
---
Oh boy
---
Make sure the other players don't drink any cleaning products.
---
i can attest to the fact sometimes it IS broken
---
i dont take any workshops,pacifist always on, one time both myself and a teammate were in whitesprings repairing weapons and a lvl 200 came in and one shot us both
---
we both were confused and pissed
---
Come to the dark side
---
I got a shit from whitespring yesterday.  If you nuke it more on the northern side but keeping the bunker in the zone too.
---
Honestly, the only reason I kept running the stupid event was for the caps (though honestly, the event was pretty good, if a little slow).
---
I'm hoping that all the plans/masks that I've accumulated might at some point be worth it to sell (player vending?!?), but I'll more likely just give most of them away.
---
I'd have to go back and count my masks, but it seems like I've made 4-5K caps running the event.  Doing the math I hope it's not that many &gt;.&lt;
---
Mama Dolce’s 
---
Only place I know you can still get them is the grafton monster that spawns at hemlock holes . Three different times I've seen it drop BOS combat armor arms or chest. Not the legs yet tho
---
Yes please - my favorite thing is choosing an appropriate outfit for any missions and what not. Gets me into trouble with my team, but they are starting to come around :)
---
Yes, just let it sit in your quests forever. Stop tracking it if it bothers you to see it on the main screen. It's part of the game, but it doesn't have to be part of _your_ game. None of the quests _have_ to be completed if you don't want to! :)
---
The camera mode starts off behind the character for some reason.
---
Pretty hard to hit someone with Speed Demon and Marathoners, especially if they start to move sporadically.
---
I had a similiar [idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3ef6m/an_idea_for_better_stash_space/) hope the devs keep seeing this as a desired in game option!
---
Uranium Fever has three 3\* mole miners every time
---
yeah the servers are back to crap, this will kill any good word of mouth  he game started to get
---
in an online game, we really need the ONLINE part to function
---
Read up on popular builds and spend some time with a perk calculator before you level too high. Figuring out a build and getting the right perks early on can save you a lot of headache and wasted perks.
---
Worth booting up for.  Thank you for adding me. 
---
You mean the Fatman?
---
Happened to me once where I couldn’t loot the body, but the head was detached and allowed me to loot the head only. Weird.
---
Happy to!
---
Noticing general instability increase and just weird stuff happening. 
---
The real question should be how a Mr Handy is able to move his stall around all by himself. 
---
OMG.. entering edit mode..lol..
---
Those things will kill you!
---
how come when anyone makes a comment on the odds the knee-jerk statement that comes up is "sO eVeRYoNe GEtS oNe???" nobody is saying that, dude. all anyone is suggesting that there should be a reasonable reward for your efforts. giving people a *slight* boost in odds in exchange for tens of hours of effort hardly devalues these items. OP's model is simply an example that can be adjusted, but their numbers really aren't even outrageous. the great majority of the player base will not exceed 25 runs, let alone 50, 75, 100 etc. pair with that the fact that rng would still be pretty substantial, these masks would not just be on every corner.
---
i seriously don't know how anyone can argue in favor for these astronomical odds. they are so rare that we can barely get proof of them. they are so rare that one of the ~2 people that came forward said he was offered *$500* for the mask. that is just downright insane. 
---
I live off of old beer and preserved food.
---
You wagered wrong, and if your having fun what's the problem?  Some people enjoy the grind for rares, seems to me your the one wanting to run their enjoyment by making everything common.
---
The mesh flooring fixed it, thanks for answering!
---
Same
---
If your on a new character any other new character that pops you in the head with sneak attack damage will one shot you.  Not sure why your worried about TSE when you'll die to a pipe rifle anyway lol. Just saying :P
---
Low level = sneak everywhere or make friends.  
---
I've got a group of 3-5 guys I'll be rolling with, and no, we aren't set on just running around killing people for no reason.  However, that 20% xp buff, compounder with 15% from charisma team perk, and 5% from resting and 5% from cranberry juice and 5% from the mothman enlightenment event buff...well we have plenty of reason to roam around with our high levels.  
---
Hello, and thanks for the reports! We believe this login error is now resolved.
---
Man i really wish i’d bought that emote now.
---
im an advocate for adjusting the odds/algorithm, but nobody should be guaranteed a rare mask. 
---
Bethesda please, because the masks aren't dropping they've started to come out of my console and assault me.
---
One managed to get on my face and I thought I felt a slight pain in my head and now I hunger for blood.
---
Please fix this.
---
Hi everyone,
---
Thanks for the reports about this login issue, and for your patience while we looked into it. We believe this is now resolved.
---
+karma 
---
You can't pick up everything then. I'm a shotgun/vats/crit build and I still squeezed in weight reduction perks.
---
I‘m glad that it got solved so fast, still lost all my gear tho..
---
My Melee character (67) currently can hit with my DeathClaw Gauntlet for 785 (1500 if you are at full health) damage and ignore 75% of your armor. I could probably up that a bit more if I eat a Glowing meat steak and take a chem and some booze.
---
And triple that if I manage to get a surprise hit on you.
---
And double all that if I drink Nukashine.
---
It is very possible to one hit folks, even in PA.
---
Nice! Np!
---
PC here. I was getting an issue where it was saying "Unable to verify game code" today and validating the files from the launcher helped fix this issue. 
---
Plural of anecdotes is not data, but I've noticed an uptick in "Mutant's &lt;x&gt;" since I stashed a Mutant's Power Fist. You may well be on to something.
---
I've had mixed luck with this, but my Bloody Mess was only 1 star.
---
What I've been experiencing more and more as time goes on, is that the loot will not include any kind of legendary.  Once or twice there was a syringer, which I assume takes the place of a lego, but *well* over have the time yesterday there was nothing except junk (and screws, TYVM).
---
Sounds like someone may have been talking out of their ass.
---
Do you just make up stuff to argue about?
---
 I never said I want them common. If a hardcore player is going to put in 50 plus runs on an event the likelihood of one rare drop should be greater than 0%.
---
 They designed 5 masks that nobody will ever get to see except for on those , how does that make any sense in your head at all?
---
Agreed these stories always make wonder. I play on PS4 and at lev160 with about five hundred hours I’ve never had these experiences. I’ve also never been killed by slap damage. Something never adds up in these cry me a river ‘griefer’ stories. 
---
Thank you!  Union uniform plans for me!
---
It could be a ghoul only "feature" i don't have enough experience with other types of mobs to know if checking back later works.
---
The only thing i know for sure is that checking a dead ghoul later for that missing legendary item can work.
---
It's never anything good anyway... 
---
It’s in the black mountain ordinance works
---
Or can each vendor have their own caps instead of 200 per faction? I honestly feel like that must have been a big that just never got fixed.
---
i didn't know those generated an actual report... what do they say?? the decorator also gives a score for what you decorate.. maybe this is tied-in in some way?
---
I had it happen a few times, way better having 2 quests.
---
We believe this login error is now resolved. Thanks for your reports and patience!
---
For low levels... you can find 2 Military Ammo bags as guaranteed spawns at the Relay Tower west of Flatwood.  Can also find a few at Camp McFlintlock.
---
I would recommend not spending them to repair armor at anything below 45/50 though.  Get your Armorer and repairing perk cards up high enough to reduce the cost of crafting / repairing items, and it should remove the Ballistic Fiber requirement.  I know that Armorer rank 2 removed Ballistic Fiber until level 45/50 gear.  Not sure what rank required for repairing.
---
Nice! I got the Confederate uniform plans today!
---
My sniper character would give anything for a ghillie suit.
---
That is a valid point, and another example of how much Bethesda just didnt give a fuck when developing FO76.
---
Im sure ive declined offers and never had this come up, and ive seen people saying there was no way to say why it was declibed so i dont know, id never seen this before
---
Any BoS camp and the place where line in the sand event is, I forget the name , but tons of military bags in there.
---
Not a guarantee but greater than 0% would be much appreciated
---
You get it at Camp McClintock, The BOS headquarter (Allegheny) and from the various BOS outposts in the Bog. Look for military duct tape and ammo bags.
---
I didn’t play beta but the “discover locations within..”, learn recipes, and other challenges are broken for me. 
---
Nope. Been hanging around the Forest then my screen starts to shake as though there's a Deathclaw nearby.
---
Guys sorry i was super high. I dont even know what does any of this mean. I just said the exact opposite of the op. :D i had a giggle
---
Cool
---
The case that duping wasn't bad for players merits discussion, but I'm disgusted that meta for endgame builds has been directly controlled by a small number of selfish assholes. I see some pseudo-rage on this sub about duping, but most high level players I know have a duper friend with maybe one degree of separation. When they're getting rare materials and gear on the low they don't care if it was duped and it gets swept under the rug; dupers and their dealers get a pass.  
---
Biv is always drunk. Maybe it forgot it already gave you something to do
---
And you keep ignoring what I say. Not suprising
---
Do you need Union?
---
They just need to do a whole Fo4 DLC where they give us all the assets they neglected to put in the game in the first place.
---
Maybe I’m drunk and I’m seeing double 
---
Lol did you even read my post? I said I didn’t mind at all. I got a bunch of caps and didn’t even lose that much junk. Aren’t we all swimming in extra junk?
---
Only down side is it caps at lvl 40 but with certain roles can still be very worthwhile 
---
for me, not so much the fatman, but the missile launcher.I even bought a 2 shot tracking missil launcher.
---
No there literally are none for rifles.
---
Yeah, that's the only downside to the location I picked in regards to Fast Travelling. 
---
You can Fast Travel to Vault 76 for free, my base is only like a 3-4 cap travel (from an equivalent distance) from Vault 76. 
---
So having a base in the middle of the map is smart for cutting down on travel costs. Regardless I'm sitting on a decent stack of caps, normally the actions I perform after fast travelling will cover the cost anyways.
---
They really don't say much other than the steins you gave him were matching the appropriate time period.
---
They also state they had wine or spices in them but nothing leads me to believe that they will actually be used as a currency.
---
But what about the funky music from Nukashine. I'd much rather have that. 
---
I don't have that one yet!
---
Is it an open server? If it's on PC I'd be down to join
---
I don't think its unreasonable to be over level 150 by now at over 4 months since launch.   I have taken things VERY slow, always played solo and only play at most 2 hours a night and I am level 65.  Did you mean to type level 33?
---
r/woosh.
---
u/enseminator was suggesting you inhaled strange vapors that made you weird. Not a cause to your bugs.
---
I guess me, all my friends that played it, and the message boards I went on at that time all had a different experience than you 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
---
Literally just happened to me 5 mins ago as well 
---
is there anything that you noticed from it that suggests you can adjust whatever your doing to get a different/better score/report? im not home rn otherwise id check for myself lol.
---
I wouldn't sweat it, level 41 is still pretty low level, especially if you play solo. You'll get plenty more chances to help out once you complete the storyline...and a lot more ability to help as well! Right now, concentrate on surviving and lend a hand when you can. That's plenty good enough at your level! 👍😂
---
No idea i didnt try it
---
Yo I’ve met someone like this, I asked for steel, stims, and adhesive. He gave me 200 bulk steel, 120 bulk adhesive, and 600 diluted stims and as well a ton I plans. Also he gave me a full set of ultra site power armor. Nicest best dude I’ve ever met by far. I had to actually drop like half of the steel because my box was full and I was like 150 overweight.
---
You must be suffering from the "ghost" items. Try submitting a ticket.
---
Nope, it’s definitely not him.  But I’m sure it’s a reference to his greatness.  Deezer’s lemonade was it!
---
I hit decline on an offer for things sold to me and this menu came up
---
That's not how I play though. I'm a completionist. Gotta do everything 
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Your the one making things up, didn't someone datamine it was .03%?  That is greater than 0 and for an event that runs so often for so many people it's an acceptable drop rate for a rare.  How does everyone getting a rare item makes any sense in your head at all?  Everyone owning one = common, not rare.
---
It’s yours.  Heading back to you. 
---
I agree with that one too..have a Bunker Buster sitting right next to the Fatman in virtual stash space..
---
Take my upvote for logic and reason.
---
And those are very mighty  balloons!
---
If they could figure out a way to make it not affect server stability and just remove it that would be awesome. I don't want to have to eventually get rid of my wardrobe
---
I don't want everyone to own one, not everybody's going to run the event more than a handful of times.
---
 Nobody owning one = non existent
---
I think a good method would be something like this :
---
There are X items in the loot table with percentages varying by item.
---
If you already have the rolled item, then split its odds evenly among other items in the same tier. 
---
If all items in a given tier have been acquired, reroll until you find an uncompleted tier.
---
In this way you will never get a repeated item, and will eventually get all items, while still maintaing RNG options.
---
But to be honest, if its a rare item and you dont manage to get it tgen fair enough. The above method works for longer events, but not for limited duration events with too many items.
---
Yeah this is the part of WORKSHOPS that is broken
---
Bethesda doesnt seem to want to fix it, even though many many many people have complained about it
---
i can almost start to see why people are/have left the game, Bethesda really needs to step up their game fixing crap like this
---
THIS is how workshop contesting should work:
---
PvP is ONLY in the Workshop!
---
if you see the workshop is contested, you should have 2 options:
---
1) I do not travel to the workshop, and i lose the workshop to the other player who contested it. Contesting players cannot find you anywhere in the world and kill you.
---
2) I travel to the workshop to defend it, and once i step inside the green border ring, PVP is on!  after that, its a battle until one player is victorious.  Once battle is started, PvP can extend beyond the green border ring
---
The broken part is that any player that contests the workshop can then leave the workshop area, find the owner anywhere in the world and kill them.
---
WORKSHOP PVP SHOULD STAY IN THE WORKSHOP!!!
---
I noticed this too. Her wing attacks seem to stagger anyone standing there, but if you are right next to her it doesnt look like it deals the physical damage. I've notice her back up when I aggro her and she seems to do more significant damage from that distance.
---
I hit 2 n 3 sometimes. 
---
+karma
---
You can find some military ammo bag in Fort Defiance or any military zone, or if you fine for buy, train station vendors. And if you are lucky, Mothman drops ballistic fiber.
---
Here another tip for save some ballistic fiber; you can use "White Knight" perk card in Agility.
---
Or people that realize the 60 caps + mats (hello screws!) are still worth the effort if you have literally nothing better to do with your time.
---
Used to be worth the effort.  Last night, 10-15 server hops to find an active event (odd luck I'd guess), fortunately I was doing other things offline at the same time.  Still, I've been making much more than the 1400 caps a day you can get from vendors.
---
Noooooooooo!
---
If you’re still on in 5, I’ll join you 
---
It won't let you complete more than 1 a day but you can have multiple active. Saves you the trip :)
---
I like it but it will just be a power armor exploding shot gun feast. I can also see people building mobile theme camps  at the edge.
---
The aster at the whitespring turns crimson.  
---
I always stand on top, so they're burning me. Lol
---
Yep, I'll be here!
---
I feel u. I got two legendary .50 cals, legdary fatman, shotguns and melee weapons I keep saying I’m gonna use but I always end up using the same shit
---
They gave me lots of plans to learn. I was very thankful.
---
No, I completed them both. Both completed separately.
---
Well that would cause problems, yes! ;D I can only applaud your determination. Good luck! 
---
if only it had good legendaries...
---
Now that's cool! It's so rare to find out how the random folks that I've help out are doing now. I've friended several, but my work schedule and other obligations keep me from logging on as much as I'd like to, but I'd love to hear the stories of their progression. 
---
Yup, but they have a pretty minimalist base so there is a lot of potential owo
---
I'll tell you some good news. It appears to me that there are certain items that are actually meta, but are commonly ignored by these guys. Items that I believe to be priceless can be still bought for shit and caps. Yesterday we had some mixed trade (ie few items for few items). The seller had no problems with giving us the best gun he had yet objected heavily when we asked for a medicore one thats considered meta. This game is way to complicated to cease experimenting and settle for 'this is the right way'.
---
I like the people who build underwater entrances.  I have aqua girl, so it's no barrier to me, but it is a neat idea.
---
Yeah I tried that, the foundation piece snapped but the walls just stayed unremoveable.
---
since i can count my trade activities on one hand and made them only at the beginning, i am absolutely sure that it exists since the beginning.
---
I believe it is only active if you reject a requested offer as a buyer.
---
my god what a @#$@#$ snowflake you are, you get triggered by a "passive aggressive statement"
---
i weep for the future, kids today are such pussies my god grow up and grow a pair
---
Oh I know that. I still keep a Tesla rifle for low level areas, and a metric ton of aid items and ammo because why not. I can still get it down to around 140-150
---
That very kind
---
I was having this issue this morning and from the launcher, scan and repair fixed this for me as relogging from the game menu several times did not work. 
---
Could be True, look closely at the "burning man" bonfire and you will see a shoe in the pile
---
You mean like canned coffee? I'm already hoarding canned coffee
---
well good for you, but alot of us DO care if our bases get leveled by an orbital strike by a 13 yr old bored kid
---
Any lever action rifle or metal building set plans in stock? If so how much?
---
Me too. 
---
Glad to hear!
---
Yeah I’m trying to figure that out, that’s the goal... I’m just getting super weird results already. But next time i have some time I’ll try it with suppressed mutations and a dense torso and see if I can get useable data. 
---
Yeah I don’t get attacked very often.
---
Oh no I was suggesting an in game occurrence. If you haven't explored Hornwright Industrial in Charleston yet, it explains why. Spoiler alert;
---
There's a giant automated mining machine that is still operational. I can't recall the name but it is what causes the rumbling.
---
Try getting into a different PA frame and see if that explodes too.
---
Please search this Reddit for how to defeat sentinel build. I beg of you. :(
---
Eh screw it, I'll put it here, though there are more: any perk that gives a chance to stagger.  (One gun army for example) (stagger =not standing still and not standing still means no sentinel damage reduction).  Their disadvantage is that they can't move.  Their advantage is that nobody searches the Reddit to know how to easily make them move.  
---
Also then keep in mind the implications the legendary vendor might have on the game and accessibility to gear.  Then refect on the fact that if u get ur butt wooped, you can head to adventure to recuperate.  :) 
---
As the tenth, I would say "Do that twice a day". 
---
But then again, I mainly cure people with nukashine.
---
You can see the whole leg if you look at a different angle.
---
Here's a [word cloud](https://i.imgur.com/FPKAunN.jpg) of this comment section
---
Might have something to do with the kid who killed himself in the real helvetia.. Google it, it's actually pretty interesting. 
---
Do the fasnacht quest, sloth is automatic.
---
As per the behemoth, I heard it spawns in the water park up north.
---
Honestly I don't care, as long as I get paid caps.
---
Thats so nice of you!
---
I am disinterested with any forms of future communication with you. Have a great life coming to people who are sharing some of what they know and dully trying to be ironic. Blocked.
---
screws fall out all the time. The world's an imperfect place. 
---
That would be ideal. For any legendary also, it would be nice to be able to upgrade their level. Idek if it's the fill cost of making another, or of we need the plan first. 
---
Yeah I'd love the Nukashine jukebox.
---
Thanks! I'm just trying to help out fellow vault dwellers :)
---
It is nice, it's also nice to have a level 45 Somerset.
---
So good not to like these masks. 
---
I like smashing camps. That pacifist change extending to camps makes me sad. 
---
End of an era
---
Well, Somerset Special is great for a pistol build (or just a light backup weapon). Pistols don’t get any other anti-armor so having that guaranteed is nice.
---
And the blade of Bastet is amazing for a 1star. Highest base damage 1h in the game I believe, with light weight and inherent 50% armor piercing, it’s another great backup weapon (or primary if you are a melee specialist, until you get a better legendary)
---
Oh really I have no idea why that would happen then
---
Yeah, I mean when it first released it was just me and one other friend. He recently stopped playing (Idk if for good or not) so now it's just me, all alone.
---
I started doing more events and this sub got me to try to help someone just the other day. I just led him to my C.A.M.P., which they used for quite a while, I dropped them some armor and a 10mm. But, like I said, they weren't anything too great and I won't use them. He ended up taking them, so I felt decent.
---
but at least the robots walk so fast its easy to get multiple events in... right?   anyone...?
---
aw who am i kidding i actually hate fasnacht now after all this
---
I haven't seen that yet, but I don't know that I've helped with those specific quests so I would like to test that.
---
Love hearing things like this! I play as a medic and have my camp over the River from the whitesprings gold corse without any locked doors and two unlocked water purifiers I come home often and see people using things so I just give a friendly wave , drop some stuff they may be able to use and head off again
---
Very good of you! If you're on PC hit me up sometime. IGN=The_zimmers.  
---
Cheers! 
---
Dude their is not live lost for Beth or Zeni its the blatant disrespect to the consumer,  like you and me man. Sure they had games with problems before but they never released a game this broken before. That is not only disrespectful but greedy when they ask for full price for a broken game, and dont give me that story about updates are comming to fix it because no matter when you buy in the world I doubt you have ever paid for half of something and then sat back hopping for the other half to be delivered? So dont even go there about hate mongering. Its you who has a bigger problem because your contributing to this behaviour from them. So go and play your game untill you cant do anymore because its either broken or incomplete, and ill play my W3 that happens to be a complete game, oh and look DLC thats basically another game for the price of a DLC........ Have fun!!
---
Damn,son! These dirty plaster walls scared the crap out of me... For real, I forgot how awful they looked since I switched long time ago to the clean plaster walls mod I made :D
---
Never-mind all that, where did you get that parka jacket, really want one?
---
you can just look up the lyrics...
---
"You don't need a hole in the head."
---
Haaaaa. My bad then. I thought you said so because of those weird fumes cause his comment was out of space.
---
(I've seen around all the map now I believe, even if I may have missed a few points, I definitely have seen that huge thing, and I've taken its workshop a few times)
---
I have the level 50 version and it still does decent for me. I was killing legendaries in toxic valley pretty easily with it, and I have no SMG perks at all. Shotgun build.
---
Thank you! Good luck on what your doing as well!
---
Maybe that’s how we get the other masks, by not burning the effigy. It might time out and give us the other masks. Speculation here.
---
Yikes. I’ll try that next time I test. I’m not so sure suppressing mutations is working properly either. I tried doing that on my main to eliminate Adrenal and instead I “locked” my damage to ludicrous numbers. I’m talking my bloodied Gatling gun showing 900 damage. Relogging fixed it, but yeah... 
---
You miss the point. I will not use VATS. 
---
 My Instagram is full of my new kitten, he's just 7 months now. He will be a real Tom Cat and he has unrestricted access to the wild here on Vancouver Island. Hmm, this is actually my Instagram name too. ;)
---
Enjoy every minute of it. 
---
Okay cool. Only have 4 charisma so.
---
remember, best way to get into a locked house is glitch in by accessing crafting station/chair/bed/musical instrument htrough windows... pulls you right inside!
---
Yeah, little metal pipe things, all kinds of different shapes. I think there's just one plan and you get them all. 
---
I know there was other ways to clip wires through walls with out them, you can find it on YouTube, but I don't know if it's been patched to stop that. 
---
The only other way I know is running it through a window. 
---
I’ll keep that in mind!
---
Not really. if you give him the proper steins he gives you the excellent.  There are also metal and wooden ones around the town I'm guessing are the average and poor steins.
---
How did you make them? I prefer clean myself 
---
Rc
---
I may have to test with higher damage weapons and just spam stimpacks in between to get bigger numbers to work with. That sounds roughly like what I was getting, though. I did find that missing didn’t seem to matter, as I accidentally missed a shot and the damage didn’t reset. It might reset if you hit a different target, though. 
---
If you team with higher level players, then it shouldn't matter too much what level you are. 
---
That is really nice, wonder how long it will take to get all recipes learned.
---
I love the area but all the creatures with really high DR makes me really reconsider where I go there. 
---
I love that idea. I love the functionality of it and the display aesthetic it could add to our shops. Def dig it.
---
What was not so funny was I just had to renew my drivers license the week before. So I told my wife that this quest was making me crazy because it was making relive what we just went through at the DMV :)
---
I only costs junk that we all have a lot of though. It’s not like we even have to place the objects again. And the most of the junk item needed are very common. It’s at worst a minor inconvenience 
---
Actually the last couple of weeks on PS4 I've ran into worlds where my friends are being full and having to wait to log on. Never had that happen before the new content.
---
Thanks all. It’s the only type I struggled with
---
I almost posted the same thing 
---
Honestly, I'm divided. I kinda like rare stuff, but at the same time I can't help but remember Halo 3 and the brilliant way they handled the armours.
---
I remember Recon was actually a challenge and not RNG based at all, it is probably one of the only times I can think of moment in my gaming life that a game has had really good shit *and* it's not been a p2w/luckfest.
---
Reach was also very good, but you could still get a bit of luck with the jackpots after games.
---
I was new in mmos once. I remember how much it sucks when high levels shit on you or when you can't do things alone, so I try to help when I can.
---
I'm not as think as you drunk I am *hic*
---
They're taking out slap damage so nobody can kill you ever if you dont want. I've never been killed anyways. Maybe three people have tried initiating pvp with me and all I did to avoid it is exit to the menu. They cant kill you if you aren't in the server anymore.
---
My Dad used to work construction, he would never close the door, why you ask?
---
The crane operators would fuck with you as soon as you closed the door. You had to keep your guard up. 
---
That one where u need to drink and do something while the buff is active is the daily.
---
The other where u need to gib Bov some Booze u made by yourself is a weekly.
---
I doubt anyone came back just for the masks, or that people worth playing with are going to leave a game they enjoy over it. This is being made into a bigger deal than it is. Rare is rare.
---
I got two on my first time two. One was to make High Voltage Hefe and the other was to drink Beer and shoot.
---
Yeah and toxic valley tops out at like 25; you’re using a level 50 gun. The 10mm SMG is decent on its own; the legendary fire effect is negligible difference. 
---
Found this googling my issue. I have 2 2080Ti's in SLi, but the way my motherboard works (ASUS X299 TUF Mark 1) the lower GPU is #1 by how the board sets the hardware IDs or something. MSIAB sees the lower as GPU #1, the BIOS calls it GPU #1, but nvidia ctrl panel calls it GPU 2 of 2 which adds to the confusion. FO76 doesn't look at how the board sets the addresses apparently as it was always trying to render on the top GPU even though SLi was OFF and all monitors were plugged into the lower GPU. Following this method completely fixed the rendering card issue and I am back to 4k @ Geforce Experience Optimized settings (Ultra/High mix) running \~120fps.
---
Thanks for this post.
---
Sad thing is it was going take a year to get enough tokens to get the set, with this week delay and probably going be a month before a fix, the devs should either give us more tokens or let us be able to do all 3 dailies at camden a day.
---
I’m still yet to get a recipe at all and I’ve done the scorch queen loads lol, it’s all just luck 
---
Smart, very smart. I'll have to remember this, thanks!
---
I like checking in on my babies. I have one friend who started as a punk trying to powerlevel at whitesprings and 2shotting melee builds.
---
He's over 70 now, a lot calmer and not so aggro, and we try to play together often. He's still a punk tho. :P
---
I had a similar story, though your's outdoes mine on generosity.  I was level 8 and was exploring Wavy Willard's Waterpark when I get a message from a level 80+ guy saying that my Workshop was being attacked.  I saw the quest icon, but as I barely knew what the workshops were and I did build some minor defenses I didn't think anything of it.
---
Well I went back to the workshop to find he had defended it, and he proceeded to tell me how to lock extractors (I didn't even know the game had extractors at that point).
---
After that he invited me to a team, told me to come to his CAMP which made which looked like a palace compared to mine, and gave me some armor and some plans.
---
&gt;There is a certain breed of Fallout fan who thinks that every Fallout ever released is the worst ever and completely destroys the franchise. 
---
r/fallout. 
---
Seriously, the day 76 came out, one of the top posts on that sub was "Fallout 4 was really a lot better than we thought it was". Like, yeah, people have been saying that for years but got pushed more towards r/fo4 because "gud gaem bad fallout". 
---
I had all the robots die around me randomly at the Military Training Camp.  Had to find a new server 4 times (having to do the training ALL OVER on each) to have the Sarge die on me...
---
Ah right
---
I found it at the flooded trainyard near watoga. Its the explorer outfit.
---
**It's one of those flaming bags again!**

*Don't put it out with your boots, Ted!*

**Don't tell me what to do, Devil Woman!** \*Stamps out Flaming Bag\*

---
Always.

Oh I'm so leaving a Giddyup buttercup head if I can find on in someones bed...
---
Not really player vending will only work if you find someone's camp. Having a meeting spot makes a fun online market, Use discord to gather everyone!
---
That’s exactly what everyone who has a argument is saying, “if I grind the event I should be guaranteed a rare mask” there are even people who think that Bethesda didn’t even put the masks in the game. Efforts shouldn’t be considered for a item that is rare, that is the whole point of the item being rare. I hate to say this but it comes right from the entitlement generation and the generation of everyone should get a reward. 
---
The Parade ends tomorrow, right?
---
Tom wins
---
Maybe try games like RUST/ARK/Atlas (probably more like it)... Breaking (raiding) player bases in those games is way funner and more rewarding.
---
Try the Enclave. Go to the military wing and search the desks in the first room you come to.
---
Yeah, I feel the C.a.m.p system has a lot more bugs compared to the rest of the systems in-game.
---
Often just to get a piece to snap I would need to look at it from different elevations. It's snapping yo the same piece but If I go from up high it snaps, down low? Nothing.
---
I guess we just gotta wait for them to iron out the problems......eventually.
---
Ya sure 
---
It wastes a lot more time prepping a nuke than either doing the parade or server hopping to find a new one. Congrats to you.
---
i think at end of today? i better check again
---
Foxes. Poor foxes.
---
I would like to see death match and team death match game modes! Your right there is allot of potential for PvP just hard to organize!
---
I saw someone yesterday that had what looked to be racing stripes on theirs. Had not seen that paint scheme before???
---
No it ends on 26th.
---
Advanced Power Connectors is the switches and its at Harpers ferry  - Around 270 caps
---
Powered Gates is the doors and its at the BOS bot in watoga (Not the train station) - around 190 caps
---
1. there is a warning
---
2. fast travel exists
---
3. server hopping exists.
---
You did no harm, no need to be prou..i mean guilty.
---
I see, except people do own them but because you didn't get one they don't exist.  Something something entitlement blah blah... You seem too wrapped up in yourself to continue to bother with.
---
nuka grenades? Imma throw my exploding PA at those supermutants :o
---
btw anybody saw the ability from FO4 to eject destabilzed power cores that explode after a given time in FO76 yet?
---
Kinda related question, but did you find that turning in several pieces of technical data at a time yielded better results than just one? To me it seems like only the first time I do it the reward is actually okay-ish. Then it's just stimpaks and ammo. Regardless of how many or few at a time I do.
---
Lots of servers aren't totally full, too. Then most people aren't going to be also hanging out around that little place, so I imagine you'd see maybe 1 or 2 people (if you're lucky) on each server.
---
Right because 5 or 10 people out of a 1/2 a million seems right to you. What a joke.
---
Thanks a bunch 
---
It's here, I just repainted standard wall textures: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/220
---
Also I included some other variations for wall textures here: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/253
---
I dont know exactly how many times I grinded  this event, but it’s probably close to 50. It wasnt until last night that I finally received the Beret— I was super stoked.
---
Is it a bit of a let down to always receive the same masks, hell yea... but I also know that people are selling bundles of the 5 common masks for 500c right now. As this game improves and more users enter, that number will only go up over time.
---
Not to mention the other loot Ive received such as weapons, mininukes, waste acid (Beeswax) has been rewarding itself.
---
Everyone having tobacco breakfasts rn are laughing with you.
---
All the while their cancer slowly grows...
---
Lol it’s a little funny. I doubt anyone got blown away but you bet they scattered 😂 oh well get a mask kill a few glowing things sounds like a good time in the end. 
---
If Bethesda didn't want it to be possible, they would have placed Helvetia in the green zone
---
Happy to help!
---
Probably your best bet, although I’d probably see if a perforating mag did better. More damage per shot is probably better, and it might even be lower AP usage. A pipe gun wouldn’t do as much damage, but would weigh about half as much. 
---
I'll be playing mostly survival starting tomorrow but add me, PrimordialPear. Just join up whenever.
---
These masks aren't rare they are practically non-existent.
---
I would say settle down Rosa, but I'd be right there with you.
---
The one and only time I killed a cat and saw that it's only possession was a strand of yarn I felt terrible.  *Terrible*.  I've never laid a hand on one since.
---
You have a misunderstanding of the term ironic if you think this situation represents any sort of tangible irony.
---
I guess you’re not that smart after all.
---
You just know how to use thesaurus.com
---
ok thanks!
---
Which platform are you on? I have ~150 pieces with nothing to use them on. 
---
I stopped wasting my time farming for it, and instead buy bulk from the vendors when I see it. It runs about 280-315 caps based on your perks, but you get x10. 
---
Got a mic, and lvl 150 something cant remember the exact number haha
---
good words
---
hmmmmm
---
&gt;There's something very "scale model" about Bethesda's world design.
---
There always has been, and it's due to software limitations. You would have to increase the map size drastically to accommodate towns that are the actual size in 76. Hell, look at the Imperial City in Oblivion. Only ~190 NPCs live there. It's obvious that more people live there in the lore; they just weren't able to show hundreds of thousands of people in a huge bustling city while also making the rest of the game. 
---
&gt; quick
---
&gt; slowly
---
I'm not saying everyone should be guaranteed but  It's almost Lake, and I don't have the numbers so I could be wrong, that they used the same percentages for getting things like the jumpsuits from events that happen all the time and put them in for this timed and limited a vent. I don't know if that's the case but it sure feels like it and it's just kind of a strange to me. Maybe don't prominently have those masks out there if the chances of getting them are so low that they're negligible.
---
Probably.... 7 or 8 if you wanna do it really easy
---
Yes, I was worried that I should be trying to get a little armour piercing effect in there. Having all those rounds in a drum is nice, but if I have to use half of them... :) Weight _does_ seem to be an issue with the handmade. I wonder if I should just go with pipe gun as you say or maybe even combat rifle? They're quite clunky too though, right? 
---
That sounds cool to me lol it reminds me of like a scaled down pubg or something 
---
, added themed camps on the outside would be kinda cool too as like a trade hub or raider betting grounds lol
---
Yeah the jukebox in the Big Als tattoo shop at VTU plays some different music out of a jukebox
---
im just tired of the same music over and over
---
i really like how the jukebox looks
---
ALSO it would be great if the jukebox REMEMBERED the on-off settings we set it to
---
everytime i return to my CAMP my jukebox has turned itself on again
---
I met the opposite, im a noobie and three high level dudes kept chasing me pelting me with their automatic weapons while im tryin to quest, it was small damage but damage nonetheless i actually had to heal. Relogging seemed to fix it though lol. 
---
Sheesh I would sell that mask for $500 if it didn't get me ban, cause this game will eventually die and boom you got $500 to invest somewhere else lol. Honestly the rare these mask are going $500 is kinda cheap for it.
---
I read on here a while back that the hill above the Whitespring Service Entrance has three that always spawn.  Hasn't failed me yet.
---
Fair enough.
---
I used an improper word, will edit now.
---
I am deeply apologetic to you, Mr. Merriam-Webster..
---
I made a post a few days ago to collect spawn locations:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b48kgi/spawn\_point\_locations\_for\_the\_lemonade\_robot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b48kgi/spawn_point_locations_for_the_lemonade_robot/)
---
Or just one jukebox but let us choose what it plays like an actual jukebox
---
Wow thanks guys. Ok I guess it's time to look at a non power armour build and figure out where to find some decent gear!
---
Just like IRL, you gotta close the door then s(h)it.  Not the other way around.
---
I've been camped behind the flatwoods church, and every time I log in, I add to that box. Low level weapons and armor, chems, food, water, plans.....   Paying it forward, I suppose. Often, higher level players end up taking a lot of it (the food, water, and ammo, mostly) so keeping it stocked for the new people can be tedious (sometimes I fill it 4 or 5 times in a half hour with low level lot and supplies).
---
Regardless, I enjoy helping people, and if it weren't for that aspect, I might not be playing this still. But, I play the same as I live irl, and that is to help those who need it.
---
Thanks for doing the same.
---
Nah, we need to be able to roast beans and make new types of brews. Like Grafton Rads: a hint of chocolate and hazelnut with a lime radiation finish.
---
Also tomorrow: OMG BETHESDA BROKE THE gAME EVERYTHANG PuRplE AtoM shOP GOne I AM DONE WITH THIS shIT GAME
---
I must say getting this outfit is proving demanding.
---
Said that I am glad that is an outfit and not a 'mandatory' weapon/armor like other games I have played... 
---
Oh, I bust out the explosives anytime I see a large group close together. That’s one reason I really appreciate FO76- you almost never got clusters of enemies worth unloading AoE on in FO4- in 76, there’s loads! Especially Distant Thunder events. I’ll just go nuts raining down explosions with quad missile/Farman/Autogrenade on those, forget waiting for Artillary. 
---
&gt;Roll on the downvotes for not claiming FO76 Is tHe BeSt gAMe eVeR!!!
---
Call me crazy, but if you end up getting downvoted, it's more likely because you're insinuating that devs who spend three years of their lives making a product didn't care about the product, not because you don't think 76 is the second coming of Jesus. 
---
Switzerland was neutral, you monster!
---
No honestly going through all that trouble to launch your nuke, kudos! Best parade in years!
---
I can't argue with you, I mean, I agree with you. This game was released in a desperate way indeed. They rushed it, clearly. Two words could have soften this shameful release: Early Access. This game was clearly far from done.
---
They're fixing, and fixing... But their engine is dated, I mean, people blame their dated engine.
---
There are other engine that are old (enough), the thing is, they were updated, Rockstar has RAGE, it's not a new engine, it just happened to get updated for each new release, heavily updated along the years. Cry Engine is another one that that managed to keep up with time, there are others.
---
The light in Fallout 76 is absurdly poorly done. They fixed some stuff, but using the Power Armor lamp/torch can blind you (in game) so you can't see objects over a table, right in front of you.
---
And I'll not even talking about the "legacy bugs" that people mentioned that were present in Fallout 4 (I didn't play it yet) and are present in Fallout 76. They just don't overhaul the Engine and it's really needed. I don't know if they fixed it, but I saw some ray lights coming out of the sun passing through the ground because a mountain was blocking the sun from the character view, so I couldn't see the sun but I could see the god rays coming out if it, passing though the ground LOL.
---
Fallout 76 was clearly half assed and delivered. There's no doubt. They're fixing stuff, adding content, like the new mission, pretty much an excuse to make players grind more over itens, killing hordes of enemies (easy, low level enemies, what a shame) while waiting for something, like a robot doing it's thing or protect something while a timer go down, like many other missions/quests/events.
---
Ah! The "Social" part of the game, it's bugged AF. A lot of times we have to close the game and run it again so we can join a team.
---
There are a lot of hassle involved when you play this game.
---
I just can't stop playing it tho.
---
Mayor for a Day can kiss my ass with its lvl 50 Gutsy horde :’(
---
Thought there was a difference between rare and ultra instinct shaggy rare?
---
Out of curiosity do you know what 0.03% out of 500000 is?
---
 My math is a little rusty but it's around 1,500. That's how many people would have to have the mask for that percentage to be correct.
---
That’s been a long-standing rumor that’s never been proven true. I consider it false.
---
Please me this in on PC...
---
Thank you!
---
I nuked Dyer Chemical yesterday just to test and see if the pods bloom.....nope, but they do glow a very pretty blue. I have no clue how they open but I just server hop like everyone else.
---
why remove mods? from armor? i am the confused
---
I’m on Xbox but I would to have people from all platforms participate! If you want I can send you the discord link 
---
i used all my saved up mini nukes for the parade
---
the final part where everyone stops defending the robots and shoots at the legendary sloth?
---
i didnt forget!  i just lob a mini nuke and take a=out all the wolves/stingwings in one go
---
parade saved!
---
I've had people take stuff out of the overseer's box as I'm putting stuff in, so I do not believe it is. It will reset with something like a boiled water and some yum yum deviled eggs or something like that for each person, but stuff you put in there is seen and available to others.
---
Damn that sucks. I thought it was a 100% thing like the receiver plans because on the player market the prime receivers sell for as much as the recipes. I got the scaly skin in my first every sbq fight but since then I haven't gotten anything 
---
It's more like an hour, and it's a daily thing lol.
---
Yes!
---
Eh? I use red laser auto pistol. The thing about laser gun is they have superior crit capacitor. When you combine that with legendary effect like furious + crit damage + -ap cost and perks like concentrated fire + better crit + crit savvy + four leaf: you can land insane crit damage 3 times in a single VATS activation. 
---
If you pop coffee before fighting, You can down SB with this setups in seconds. 
---
It is not remotely close to 'irrelevant'
---
Xbox, but we accept everyone 
---
I think the problem is that it is a time limited event that has odds that are worse than getting a perfectly preserved pie. If it wasn't time limited, it wouldn't be a problem. I'd say keep it rare and special, like the pie. And at least you get a small boost in odds every time you try to get the pie.
---
If you are that far you had to have already fabricated it, it's the first part of the quest tree. Did you put it in your stash box or accidentally drop/sell it?
---
Ah that’s what I had, right makes more sense then, thanks
---
Mods for PC users, not in game weapon and armor mods.
---
The guaranteed way to get them is from MODUS Medical wing in the Enclave. They are very expensive, so save up and use perks.
---
duh. sorry.
---
That's perfect, I'm xbox as well. I'd love to join. However I'm not much for mods, im a bit of a set hoarder
---
I like the idea. I will add it to the list for potential use.
---
Interesting, retracting my previous statement until reverified in further testing
---
Lol if you weren't on console I'd say some hacker is trolling you. Is your X-01 modded? I remember in the past people couldn't wear their armors that had certain headlamp colors because they became atom shop items of the mothman eyes; might be similar situation.
---
its broken, Beth doesnt care
---
servers broken, beth doesnt care
---
workshop pvp broken, beth doenst care
---
ATOM shop bug? BETH CARES!
---
That’s fine, I can send you the link if you’d like

I've just met him at the Highway 89 near Slocum's Joe. Nice! 👌 😉 
---
What always got me about the outrage over only robot NPCs and no humans was that they always functioned the same in Fallout games. In terms of functionality, Codsworth was always the same as Piper. Dr. Klein was the same as Veronica. Hell, one of the extremely well-received DLCs for NV has *no* human NPCs, just like 76. It's literally just a change in what you look at. 
---
For me everytime I've logged on someone drops a nuke at least once. Weird. 
---
"Two Left Hands" - I love that song.
---
That'd be great
---
My gourmand is most certainly gaining weight, not getting skinnier!  There is just soo much to eat out there!
---
Yeah, its really unfair cause people duped the tokens or were lucky to have the daily repeat for them infinitely if they server hopped. While legit players get punished with slowness and the quest being broken over a week now.
---
just go after starred legendaries
---
When it comes to SBQ, furious should be the obvious choice for any of the big mag guns. Even before the nerf to TSE, it was considerable first affix, because when TS was 100%, then Furious was 90%+ something. Problem with AA that it is hard to understanding how much damage it actually does. It aint "500 armor enemy, remove 50% armor and now my weapons has to ignore 250 armor less, which means 250 dmg more". And because there are no dmg meters or testing dummies, these 3 guns (AAE, TSE, FE)...there is no way to be sure which one of them is the best, with what build.
---
Wait if they steal your workshop they can still pvp you???
---
Important info!:
---
When the sloth works properly,  every person who got in a shot can loot it. When he floats, you can bloody mess him into pulp. But know that when you loot the pile, it disappears after, only giving you loot. 
---
One time I caught swamp itch from sleeping on a dirty sleeping bag and a few moments later stumbled across a CAMP and slept in their bed.  
---
Any easy place to find them?
---
Yeah, essentially it’s a massive disconnect between PVE and PVP. It’s not hard at all to get an All Rise into the multi-hundreds damage range, and power attacks increase that more. Include 75% armor reduction from 3 perks, and your 550 armor becomes about 125 armor. Against a super sledge powerslamming you for 500 damage (and that’s an easy number to reach for a melee specialist; bloodied builds can get 1k damage without power attacks), your armor doesn’t amount to much. At that point you need % damage reduction effects like Blocker, Lone Wanderer, Dodgy, or legendary effects like Assassin’s and Sentinel. 
---
For me, I had to kill 10 scorchbeasts, and I did it at the "Line in the Sand" event. It triggers almost every time you server hop at Fort Defiance. Fixed up the AA turret, and went to town
---
I did mine server hopping at Whitespring. Could do Watoga also, not sure if you've completed Mayor for a Day though.
---
dude, 20 times watching those slow ass robots walk around is too  many
---
Get some popcorn to watch the shit show. 
---
Wes tech,whitespring and the place where AWOL armaments is
---
That could be fixed by giving both players fighting in the workshop the green circle radius and if someone steps out their damage becomes slap damage instead of full to avoid players abusing stepping in and out like your example. Because the circles are big enough to snipe inside still. Especially since they made it were you can attempt to steal a claim anywhere inside the workshop I don't see how travelling to the player that isn't at the workshop make any sense for pvp.
---
Usually average 3 to 4 each server
---
I gathered everything from scratch twice yesterday all by myself. The parade started with 14 minutes left on the clock. I know where all the items spawn. Not impossible but you can't screw around or be doing your first one with no idea where to find everything. 
---
You mind if I get some input, and does Four Leaf still trigger per shotgun pellet?

---
I'm honestly surprised that they were three years working on this. Part time modders have produced superior content, using this same decade old engine. 
---
I dont blame the developers though, they have done what they were told, the ultimate blame lies with the producer and project managers. 
---
There's a pond in the Savage divide that has a behemoth sleeping in it, ala Swan in FO4.
---
I know!  I want them for my camp!  The lemonade stand as well!
---
Yes, been that way since the begining.
---
Combat rifle is pretty clunky and roughly the same weight as a handmade. Pipe guns are super light but yeah, lacking in damage output (and mag capacity) 
---
I have done the event over 60 times and only got the common masks.  Your Drop rate IS BUGGED.   
---
Very Rare is not the case here.  It must be Ultra Rare. I have never seen one in game yet.   
---
Cant you make improvement for THIS event before its gone?
---
Not to feed the misinformation fire, but Ill share my experience.
---
About a month ago I bought an AAE .50 Cal. I specifically tweaked my character’s build around this gun.
---
Even with my heavy weapon perks applied (heavy gunners x3, stabilized, one gun army) and bloody mess, adrenaline, demolition expert etc, I was not very impressed with this weapon.
---
Does it do damage, absolutely... But it doesnt drop high-level enemies as quickly as I expected, no— I began to experience buyer’s remorse.
---
A couple weeks ago a 1* mutant’s LMG dropped, and even though it has lower base damage, it seems to do more damage than the AAE .50 cal.
---
Now, I understand the fire rates differ, which effects DPS, so maybe thats why the LMG “feels” stronger... who knows.
---
I’ve recently converted both to prime specifically for Scorched Earth, and really enjoy making minced meat of the hordes of enemies, even though it’s an expensive endeavor. :)
---
Sad thing is Bethesda nerfed fusion cores spawns, so I feel like eventually people will need to use the workshop to make nice cores, but we can't because of these pvp abusers.
---
Oh my God. They need to shut the door! Take the water and food but shut the damn door.
---
"This power armor has been modified with anti-theft measures.  Don't get any ideas.  ...Chump."
---
I do forbidden knowledge for Heavy Combat Armor as that's more or less all I wear, and the golf club for good measure.
---
This has become my exact response to people trying to troll/grief me and my camp, to the point where i can exit out in basically half a second and have yet to lose so much as a wall or turret from a griefer. When you can’t beat em, just hop servers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
---
Where you find the lemonade vendor? 
---
Thank you to the person who had 10 owl masks who did not want to sell any if them! You're the real hero.

I’m on PS4 so I can’t use them but thanks 
---
I’ll put on excavator Power Armor and carry them
---
Hmmm... maybe I should go for Lever Action. They are less weighty, definitely and I have the plans... I just balk at the thought of crafting and scrapping them every time I see the 'ten screws' cost! :)
---
So people are killing with slap damage? Yikes if that’s the case I’ll definitely stay off until this tues. I think this new patch removes slap damage in the base game mode. That’s bullshit. 
---
Thank you! You where right, it was already in my STASH.
---
Wow wtf that's amazing. Good luck with the testing, I'm excited to see what figures you come back with. To eliminate the possibility of higher damage from crippled limbs you could put on adamantium skeleton 3 and test it again too
---
Where is glass cavern I dont think I have found that yet. I'm level 88 and have been grinding hard the last few weeks to get here.

Here is a picture.  It predates the DLC.

If you get a friend you can have them hold the vendor and leave then rejoin until he has the outfit. It’s what I did to help my friend
---
Dang I didn’t know it predates the dlc 
---
I saw that AFTER I posted. 
---
I should have searched, but I was all wound up and excited when I saw him. 
---
Yeah, can't seem to get a head shot in VATS...
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I did everything, to include reinstalling the game and deleting and resorting the ini files. The only thing that fixed the issues, all of them, was running the game through a VPN.
---
I'm still unsure if this is an ISP or a Bethesda issue. I need one only for 76 (for bug free playing) and ESO (when updating).  All of my other games work fine. Both Bethesda and my ISP are denying it's them, so who knows what's going on.
---
I appreciate the help, though. 
---
And something to adjust the safe area because my tv doesn’t have a setting for that and I can’t see the full screen.
---
Awesome, didn’t know you could do that.
---
Yep: https://discord.gg/du5SBMb
---
You can find some decent shotguns for under 7 pounds depending on mods. Pipe weapons biggest issue is ammo capacity. You could always look for a weapon with weight reduction. Shotguns aren't bad depending on how you use and mod them. A pump with a pistol grip is under 7 pounds. You can use vats to snap aim on enemies then cancel to save ap points. Takes some practice but it works.
---
I'll give you 100 screws and 50 springs if it helps when I get home. Would be glad to help. All for free btw
---
I had a sweet floating stacked concrete foundation bunker over by v9 for the queen fight. I feel pangs of jealousy whenever I see people keep their existing stacked foundation bases after the fix.
---
I've since moved onto making a single foundation mobile base to place down at v9 for nuke drops. Since the "a fallout update has blocked the placement" will always occur in this spot, logging out and in will give me a free camp placement without the cost of caps.
---
I'm looking forward to all the salty posts from people that tried a PvP server and lost their first fight and declare the new game mode broken.
---
Yeah I’ve been trying too it’s really hard to get headshots I think it might be impossible but idk 
---
Valid point? What on Earth are you on about. Show me a single fallout game that had a vault map big enough to accommodate how many people were meant to be in a vault? Personally I only know of one. The vault with the one dude and all the puppets. And you want cities? Please. 
---
You could also check your Fallout76.ini and see if it updated.  It will have the sResourceArchive2List line that mod authors use to load their mods.
---
Of course the safest method is to just disable them until the mod authors either confirm there are no conflicts, or post an update.  
---
No need for a nuke zone to be there. I helped someone find them and we just server hopped and looked for one where it was night time. Although it's not guaranteed (still saw pods at night), but eventually we came across one.
---
Levers are great, I use that as my primary sniper rifle. Small mag size and limited fire rate though (far better than a sniper rifle, but much less than the semi-auto rifles), but their damage is very nice. No armor piercing but the damage output... you basically don’t need it. 
---
So, not sure what you specifically mean— if I unequip those perks, the base damage goes down, but go up if equipped. They absolutely increase the base damage.
---
I can test/verify later if you’d like.
---
Just play fallout shelter on the phone
---
"Forbidden Knowledge" quest
---
Lol you can't blame *one* person or group of people for mishandling a product launch. We can only confidently say that it likely wasn't the devs making the choice when to release. We cant just talk about a finished product and act like we know all the inner workings of a company we don't work for. 
---
Also, show me a mod that is similar to 76 but better. The only one I can think of off the top of my head that would even be close is New California, but the writing in it is awful, with a small boring map to boot. 
---
Creation Engine is literally not a decade old. If you think it's the same thing as Gamebryo, you don't know how software development works. 
---
I had a 3\* robot spawn in Watoga that gave me a 3\* AA golf club. :) Not too shabby.....
---
I need that Nuka Cola lamp
---
I did indeed.
---
I’d love to but only have 300ish caps left over after a serum purchase.

Yeah they just have to open the trade menu while you aren’t in the world so he doesn’t move and if you are lucky and quick enough you can get it. Be careful though he sometimes will randomly die but I’ve only had it happen once.
---
I'm skipping the remake because that scene in HD = do not want

Fastest way I get to level up, without having the bloody place taken by some OP bastard who 1-shots them all

I dont know man that sounds dangerously close to what a soon to be Wendigo would say 
---
Before they added push to talk and the (AREA) text with your name showing that you're talking on mic, I used to sneak next to people's CAMPs and make funny weird noises over my mic, it was the funniest thing ever hearing people go "What the hell is that sound?!" ahahahaha
---
yes please.
---
Exactly what I thought but I got scared as id never seen it before. All this talk of bans had me worried 😂
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Do you pick them up or just look at them in the transfer window? Do you stash any legendaries or do you carry some other type of legendaries? In your case, maybe the game doesn't see any legendary preference but could see an item type preference, so maybe you get more combat shotguns but with varying prefixes.
---
ur welcome bro!
---
Seems a bit high, but 1.5packs/day is about 8000mrem. In colorado you're taking about 125mrem/year
---
I’m hoping the player base shop expansion will give us ammo vending machines we can use that for.
---
I'm rocking that with a bowler hat and monocle. Fuck Garvey, but it suits the gentleman Western look.
---
Whoa, I got up this morning intending to get rid of it, but now my Pip-boy shows all effects. I think my melee weapon DMG numbers have gone up as well, but I'm not totally sure. Has the glitch resolved itself?
---
I made 120 ultracite plasma cores over the weekend for my bloody gatling plasma. Thing is a beast, hits 500+ damage when I'm fully buffed, and at 91 fire rate... yeah, it's impressive. Even though armor pen doesn't work for it from Stabilized, it's still actually reasonable damage vs. the queen. I can't wait for them to fix armor pen. It will be slightly higher base dps than my bloody .50 cal, and bigger magazine. 
---
Although, on half of those cores I did screw up because I didn't have 20 int, only 15. So they don't have the full overcharge. it's like 318 shots or something instead of 350 (max). RIP Yellowcake flux. Oh well. I predict we will see a LOT of gatling plasma users once that bug gets fixed. I'm trying to use up all those 318 charge cores to hide my shame lol.
---
As a power armor mechanic, I’d  love to see this 
---
When I looked at that first picture for question three, "men" is not what initially came to mind...
---
If someone follows you to a different server they are either on your friends list, or is friends with someone on your friends list that is helping them find you.
---
Oh. Nvm then. 
---
Get some power armor, a partner, and run around Whitesprings a lot.
---
No problem.
---
im ok with that!! ill sell my 5000 .38 ammo for 500 caps!
---
Level 20
---
God fk yourself Mr Level-Endgame
---
That’s two accounts, maybe I’ll add it into my rotation! Thanks!
---
Mine is BerkaSherka (I don't remember if it has a space or not) I should be on in a few hours and I'm down to team up.
---
 but you must have BOS Initiate Paint 
---
I leave teddy bears.
---
Energy weapons in general are still behind due to the lack of armor pen. Stabilized adds a huge amount of dps, especially on the queen, and it doesn't affect gatling laser / plasma. Such a bummer. If that's fixed, Gatling Plasma will be the highest sustained dps weapon in the game.
---
2k? can u keep it for me please? i will be in game tonight  psn same as name here...100% reliable
---
They are just really rare. I've boughten all 6 of mine unfortunately and none were from a drop. 
---
We just need to be able to combine Fusion Cores together (like you suggested). 
---
Make it so that one of the work-benches (the ammo one presumably) give us the ability to combine cores. If it costs an additional material(s) then just have the new core equal to the total of the old cores. Otherwise, combine cores at a small cost of the total energy (10% for example) so if you combine two 25% cores, you get a 45% core.
---
This is just a suggestion, but I think we need to ability to do this. 
---
I wish it worked like that for me. Have stashed a few pieces of weightless and chameleon and I can't get a good drop of either of those prefixes to save my life. I've had to buy every piece I own.
---
So basically every player will run more than 150 times to get that items?
---
Pay attention to which materials you tend to use more than others, specifically when repairing stuff.  Depending on what armor you use, repairing can use up plenty of ballistic fiber for a while.  I would also say make your camp near an area where you can reliably get some of the materials you're going through.  For ballistic fiber, going to the military camps is a good bet.  I tend to have my camp in the vicinity of the story quests and exploration I'm engaged in.  Having a train station (or other vendor) nearby is always a plus, too.  
---
Also, I planned WAY ahead with my SPECIAL points and perk cards.  Your plan would depend on how you play.  I focused on getting the most out of my food and drink, and managing inventory space.  I maxed the perk cards for Pack Rat (junk weighs less), Slow Metabolizer (food satisfies more), Dromedary (drinks satisfy more), and Good With Salt (food spoils slower).  
---
Lol.
---
Do we have to write bad poetry?  Not sure I qualify if so.....
---
Thanks for this post, I had given up around lvl 22 and went back today at lvl 56 and finished it.
---
I completely see how frustrating it can be, it’s certainly something that Bethesda should look at ways to resolve. Unfortunately until then I guess it’s unfortunately a case of accepting it’s an online game and not all of us are dicks.
---
Can't they just go to recent players on Xbox home and find you that way? There's a good chance my friend didn't block/ignore them in time. I feel like if you turn on pacifist mode, once your shot by another player you should be able to travel away and that player can no longer see you on the map. Some kind of solution.
---
Sell them to other players. With Bandolier only certain ammo types actually have weight, so it's better just to hoard it all and turn what you don't use into caps. Ammo usually sells pretty good.
---
In the words of Nelson Muntz: Gotta nuke something...  [Gotta nuke something](https://youtu.be/4IUxK_0WLbg) 
---
psh i told the guy i would have taken it no question. if i get banned, fuck it, i'll find another way on lol. not that they are too concerned about that anyway. if you want to feel discouraged about Bethesda's enforcement of things like that, go over to ebay and search "fallout 76." there are insane amounts of listings up for all kinds of weapons and armor.
---
Luckily, my friend had to do this quest, and it turns out the sloth at the end of the parade gives 1 commendation each time you kill it
---
so we just played normally, and when the parade came up, we did it and she completed the quest after a bit
---
for me, i just went solo to whitesprings/watoga and farmed enemies
---
lots of starred enemies at whitesprings ususally
---
Are you on PS4? I'd buy them from you
---
X-01 is the standard issue PA. Non-power users should wear their officer uniform if such rank is attained. All other personnel should wear standard U.S Army garment and armor. 
---
When I saw the Starlit Sniper outfit I made a cowgirl to go with it. Western revolver is backup (the single action revolver looks more appropriate, but that reload time...)
---
Get a good lever action, go all in on rifles/vats and maybe stealth (I did), it’s amazing. With the right perk loadout I can walk in on a group of 5 enemies and drop them all with headshots in 5 seconds with Vats (Gun Fu).
---
That being said I went all in, low health Unyielding build, so I have a ton of AP from having 34ish agility 
---
There are a ton of videos proving that it does not increase with level... It was a rumor started, then spread, on the forums. It was never confirmed or denied by Bethesda though.
---
I finally had it happen yesterday. Finally got the trophy for being at ground zero
---
I do miss that! 
---
What platform? I've dumped a couple of one star chameleon pieces recently since I've already got a piece equipped. May still have a level 50 leather (standard, not heavy, which is why I dumped it) left arm lying around.
---
If you're on PS4 I can craft those
---
Ran into this random encounter on the road north west of Ft Defiance. So thankful for enforcer perk. Also glad I was wearing my brown pants. I hate those things.
---
I also just tried to launch a nuke with one other person. The room where you have to repair all of the pipes and stuff got glitched. We repaired everything multiple times and it didn't continue. I lost a lot of PA cores and Stimpacks. 
---
Only semi related but have you gotten the dense mod unlocked through your scrapping? I've made probably a hundred chest pieces as well and I feel like I'm wasting my time.
---
Have you tried talking to them first? If you just run up to people spamming trade it's not going to end well.
---
Or even better pre-arrange trades on Reddit or Discord.
---
on the trading reddit do
---
[PLATFORM] W: Low level Legendary hunting rifle. H: Caps
---
Yeah it's cool. For the most part I don't have problems when I just stick to playing solo. I've met some very nice poeple.
---
I noticed the spawn timer, but can you elaborate on how it works exactly? Is it just a flat timer where nothing can respawn in an area for a set amount of time, regardless of how many people log out / back in?
---
I usually farm nuked Whitesprings with 2 accounts (go ahead and downvote me haters, but you can do the same thing with a friend), so I nuke it and then just rejoin after I clear it. I use a specific route which takes about 8-10 minutes per clear, then exit and rejoin my alt account. By the time I do a full circuit of Whitesprings and rejoin, things will respawn for me. Seems like it must be about 5 minutes or so? But yeah, you can't just keep respawning golf club anymore for sure.
---
Why do people waste so much time doing that quest? Even if a rare mask could sell for 25k, you would have made that just killing things and selling junk by now. Or just killing other players after the parade. It is, by far, the most boring quest to date, and everyone does it. Imagine if people amassed for every protest march.... My dad would have a job by now. 
---
We shall play tonight!
---
I am lvl 39, ID is crossdogfly. 
---
But I‘m on CET time...
---
More people win the lottery on a daily basis then win rare masks, lol.
---
Also i have a level 25 ts dragon if your interested
---
\+200 for me and nothing 
---
Why not just run a silo? It takes like 20 minutes tops.
---
This is a good idea. I would make a ton of excavator sets for people to buy. 
---
Merry Fasnacht!
---
I'm also on Central time so that's dope
---
The road along whitesprings train station has a lot. 
---
well, in your defense, you are doing the best thing to counter this, server hopping
---
but, the only criticism i have of your post is that its not really someone being an asshole if they simply load into an area, they have no way of telling what you are doing there, its not really their fault , they are just playing the game like you are
---
in fact, in whitespings i actively HOPE that someone will load int o make the enemies respawn so i can kill them over again
---
It says your settings won't let me add you, try adding me when you can
---
Thanks muchly!
---
Wish that was an exaggeration :(
---
I could not believe that a week after the patch hit posts like that were still cropping up.
---
Oh, interesting idea about the VATS aiming, will give that a go too, thanks!
---
Did you read the post of yours that I replied to? Just to refresh your memory:
---
&gt;The fact that no redditors have reported earning the masks in any legit manner
---
I linked you to one redditor that reported just this. I didn't state that he had proof or would be providing any; all I did was disprove your statement.
---
No! But if you looked at how I spend my play time you'd think I do. I'm to the point of stripping my extra weapons and armor down to barebones to get their weight down in my stash.
---
I also do that. But I only sit and play only if I can provide at least a 3 hour scratch to my itch. So I sometimes miss a day or two, depending on my after work responsibilities.
---
You bought an always online multiplayer game...
---
*i dont like multiplayer*
---
What happens when you order a cheeseburger?...
---
*i dont like cheeseburgers!*
---
The first player wasn't an asshole. They were just playing pvp. You chose to take workshops and not have on pacifist. This is going to leave you open to misunderstandings. You shot them, they thought you wanted to pvp so they retaliated in kind. Just because you lost your junk to them doesn't mean they are an asshole. They probably didn't want to deal with retaliation and so just left the server.
---
Second person is unfortunately an asshole player. Some think it is rping a raider role but still. You can be an asshole and a raider. Best just to leave the server. It's the only way to save your base.
---
Third situation is just the way the game works. Sometimes if you have taken enough time and someone els comes it can reset the spawns. Sometimes that sucks and sometimes it is a bonus. It's not the other players fault as they are wanting to play the game too. They may not have noticed you on the map or if you were in stealth you were not on the map.
---
maybe but do you have any lower level items
---
That be sweet. Upvote for awareness
---
Indeed they can follow you by the recent players menu, it's the same way I get back on to a server I was dc'd from.
---
It would seem not, otherwise I wouldn't have made a "shitpost".
---
i am, ill be on later tonight after work  :)
---
Yes please, in fact everything from that room if I’m honest!!
---
I’d like an occasional teammate, sadly I’m on pc though.
---
There are a few traditions where someone had to be sacrificed to end Winter.  Or had to be sacrificed if winter went too long, to remind or show Winter how to die. 
---
I already don't use mine. My assaultron helmet is way better. 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh yeah, I've been helped by higher levels so many times. Those guys are some real fallout OGs. My first handout was in the same place, but I was only a level 4 (literally just wrapped up my first hour in the game) and had a guy make me one of each pipe weapon, ammo for each, and fully moded armor all suited to my level. Not only all of this, but then he told me to add him and he would come check on me regularly to see if there was anything he could help me with. Since then he's come around twice and modded/helped wherever he could. Nowadays I have a fallout list of friends that's longer than the list of the rest of my playstation friends, this community is the best. So, naturally, since I have been helped so many times by so many others that when I see someone at a lower level than me I usually run up to dump some goodies on them (what goes around, comes around), not to mention it's a great way to get rid of some stuff you might consider worthless cuz another player might need it like it was made of screws. 
---
Id prefer private servers over the upcoming pacifist changes...
---
(Pacifism extending to camps ruins immersion and removes raider leverage)
---
i dont think so but ill have a look later.
---
You must live in a warm climate. Passionately burning an effigy of the personification of winter does not seem at all odd for us northerners.
---
ps4 has 2 different remote plays on ios. R-play and thier official remote play app. I like R-play alot more. Its more stable and I have a Mifi Controller to play 76 at work!
---
and now it will mysteriously appear in the ATOM store for 1500 ATOMS
---
He had a friend on the server questing.
---
PC. My ultimate goal is chameleon heavy BoS combat chest and heavy leather limbs. I've been trying to upgrade as I find stuff but I never see them or have them drop. When I finally had one drop, it was a lvl 35 leather chest from the sloth at the parade. So close and yet so far.
---
I don’t think I’ve even found a .38 weapon yet! I just dumped my ammo in the end.
---
I agree. Helping people is so important. I have dropped pa at the vault I had extra and greeted a new player. I helped others level up or just defeat the sorchbeast that was kicking their butt. I often leave ammo at stash boxes. I am a melee build, I only use 10MM. I have been helped by others. So, I pass it along. It is a good way to live.
---
You've been awarded 3 internet points. 
---
Every time I nuke whitesprings and farm it for a few hours to stock up on glowing / hardened mass, I leave all of my 1 star and junk 2 star legendaries in the blue suitcase by the Whitesprings train station. 2 hours of nuked whitesprings farming can yield 100+ legendaries. Always check, ya never know.
---
ok add me at frank woods on ps4
---
frankwoods012
---
Eeuuuuuwwwwww!
---
If the only reason you play the game is to get some masks, I suggest you move on.
---
ok what would you offer for the dragon
---
Kinda how I lost my workshop. I was in full power armor + gatling laser and they just stayed on the very edge of the workshop with sniper + stealth boy/chameleon armor. Even my targeting HUD couldnt see them
---
 I have done the event over 60 times and only got the common masks. Your Drop rate IS BUGGED.  
---
Very Rare is not the case here. It must be Ultra Rare. I have never seen one in game yet.  
---
Cant you make improvement for THIS event before its gone? 
---
They could add a new workbench just for ammo
---
I'm just disabling them until I see someone post the all clear. I've always run mod free on previous BSG games, but the inventory management in FO76 is already so time consuming that if I didn't mod the inventory UI, I would have to drop the game entirely. Really wish that BSG would just pay the mod creators and integrate these mods into the game itself. Really no excuse for how deficient the vanilla UI is.
---
Sounds about right. Raiders are important, otherwise its a single player game. A little tension, you could die, what's not to like. ;)
---
 VATS is evil. ;)
---
Not required at all!😂
---
Can't you still get it for free though?
---
Havent had enough time to fully test. 
---
Seems to be a timer that wont allow respawn till it runs out (if "speed it up with atoms" becomes a feature, I'm setting something big on fire.)
---
I never bothered with the rooms sections, just the main pro shoppe area and the maint shed behind the main resort. (Highest density) so that shaved quite a bit of time off my loop. IIRC the pro shoppe clear time/legendary drops rate was almost half what the total area was producing. So I stuck to the proshoppe and just relogged the shit out of it.
---
What the use?
---
Weightless helps with stealth. Power armor gets massive core drain with VATS use, I wouldn’t recommend it. If you aren’t doing a low health build... yeah, I’d probably go with weightless for stealth benefits. 
---
What does TIL mean?
---
Also thats pretty neat.
---
you probably have, pipe pistols and rifles use it and there is a .38 receiver for the hunting rifle and I believe one for the submachine gun too
---
Maybe it got fixed in an update?
---
Whitespring.
---
The answer to Life, the Universe and Everything.
---
Yup I'm addicted as well. I pretty much just sit in this sub to see stuff about 76 while I'm at work. I should have applied to be a moderator since I'm on this sub during my 10 hour work days.  
---
I agree with the other player Joining my area. He isn't an asshole and I wasn't mad at him. It's just how the game works. Absolutely no malice towards the other player in this situation. 
---
Acid goes for 2-4 caps per acid (non bulked). It's been less lately due to everyone being able to farm the bee hives. I need to finish stocking up on that myself before the event is over.
---
The exploit shouldn't work if they are on a team I don't think. Either way, as soon as they separate the PvP into a different server it will be better.
---
Not to mention sometime this year we get a whole different main questline in a brand new area to explore! I'm stupid excited for that.
---
not really interested, but am looking for lower level 1 star legendary 
---
I'm pm you my PSN. I probably won't be able to get online tonight though. But I'll buy it all up as soon as our schedules line up.
---
i didnt play the beta but didnt get the possess 10,000 caps 
---
ok
---
"Yeah I shot a someone and they shot back at me a few times and they killed me!  Griefers are ruining this game!!"
---
Not to say there aren't balance issues but some people really don't get they are fighting other people, not AI. 
---
Farm caps from players who own workshops in adventure mode. 
---
Go to survival and lose those caps!
---
Repeat. 
---
Nah, but seriously with the respawn being limited... Engagements may be more "escapable".  If you get killed. Place a 5cap bounty on the fella that kills you. Now hes on the map. You aren't. 
---
Advantage is yours! You can avoid him easily. Or kill him for his aid/junk. 
---
Farming players for caps may not be a thing in survival. It may still be in adventure mode that we do that. Due to the respawn system
---
Sorry bro, sounds like PETA got to your server
---
Nah they don’t, not with my testing in patch 6 anyway. 
---
This seems like the easiest thanks! 
---
Its hard for it to be an exaggeration when there were 8 witnesses at the camp including me, and i wasn’t even on their team or in the workshop boundaries. I was still being one shot by an invisible guy with an overpowered boomstick.
---
Would love it if you could recharge empty or low ones at CAMP with the fusion generator!
---
how do you get tamed creatures to your camp?
---
I agree. Or a bookshelf door. Okay.. AND a bookshelf door.
---
Oh yeah. I have food and Chen weight reduction perks on. When I’m unloaded I weigh about 130
---
Speak for yourself
---
😢
---
Wait, you do reduced damage with a bounty? I go out of my way not to be wanted so.
---
I’m a firm believer in what those high level folks did, and good on them for helping you out. I had to stand up for some low level folks getting griefed by players 100 levels higher with one shot bs while I was making trades, trying to make some caps, so it’s good to hear folks believe in the same mindset I do for this game. I don’t stand for swindlers and toxicity. It is a pvp game, but doesn’t mean we have to be weenies to each other for no reason. 
---
My buddy and I are both Environment Artists. Playing through Fallout 76 with him has been super rad because we both like reading and exploring the environments. We take turns on who reads out loud while the other person loots. 
---
Why settle for just coffee, when you can mix up a white Russian now? At least, that's how I abide. ;)
---
Today I Learned
---
Me too but must ammo types got for less then 1 cap a shot so unless we can bulk or set say 1cap per 5 the ammo market is dead on arrival in player vending.
---
We also need that option in player to player trading
---
Thanks! Would you recommend going low health build? Concerned over "rushing enemies"
---
Clever 
---
Player that punches me as I'm actively selling my stuff to a vendor.   
---
Crimson is super abundant in the cranberry bog. All the cranberries are crimson flux. Just make sure you gather a bunch of the other materials first, hardened mass etc. 
---
Make sure that you're equipping bountiful harvest and good with salt perk cards too. You get more and it lasts longer. 
---
Which one?  There's one in the nightclub that sounds like the tune playing at Valley Galleria and a faster tune at the other location near the pool table.
---
Player that shows up to the parade and does nothing.   
---
I go up to trade with someone and immediately look in ammo and aid.
---
Twice, I've given someone power armor with a full core, if possible
---
This mod accepts all the followers of Dudeism as far as I'm concerned. 
---
Yup, many are like that now. I think I'm missing only a couple recipes so I expect many lame rewards going forward.
---
Player that gets mad when I won't sell them my favorite weapon when asked to randomly trade...
---
Hmm, never tried, but can you sell it via the trade direct to someone? So if you modded up say a T-51b with a Jet Pack an Nuka paint, what is the steps to sell it for CAPS to someone?
---
So if there's a syringer then they won't end up eventually dropping the legendary item? I wasted too much time waiting at that body last night....
---
If you do the holiday event 10 times you can get it (legendary Sloth) . or if you Play uranium fever 3 times  (# legends per event)
---
&lt;3
---
I spent the first day of the event grinding constantly. I went outside for a minute and saw a squirrel and thought "intestines!" Lol
---
Tyty I’ll try today 
---
Someone told me to go outside the circle, between 12-1 if it was a clock. Apparently the area is slightly off. It has to be ghouls wearing the golf outfits.
---
Get those stealth boys ready, ima be stealing em like crazy 
---
Yes, I thought of that as well, as long as they made it so someone couldn’t just walk up and take it.  I’d be fine with someone just walking by and rechargeing there cores, I never lock anything anyway as I think it’s great to find a camp when I’m out and about and need to fix or scrap something.
---
I played each and every Fallout and I love all of them. The masks are not the only reason of course but i love to collect apparel especially rare ones, i have like 260 clothing in my Stash. I was waiting for those masks since november cause in the Book Guide they were already listed. After looking at the Photos of the event showing them I expected them to Drop more frequently . Last day of the event knowing i didn't collect any of the rarest ones with +200 runs makes me a Sad. I enjoyed the parade but I know they are bugged and Bethesda does not even admit that. Even worst if this drop rates are deliberately set like this so the event can come each year without adjustments. Do you get my point?
---
Unless it has been patched recently, the anti armor effect does not apply to explosive damage, like AA on laser weapons.
---
Hey, so I'm not super interested in caps at the moment as I'm already pretty close to the max cap limit. I'd happily trade it for something however. Do you have any interesting plans to trade it for?
---
Lol. I almost need to do this. Happy cake day btw.
---
Heh. I must have stolen your chameleon arm then. I've got similar goals; currently have chameleon right arm, regenerating right leg, and autostim combat armor chest. I'll check my stash when I get home and let you know if I've still got the arm. One star, but free is free, right?
---
Had someone test it recently and found it would and leave you in pacifist.  It's been reported multiple times since patch 6.
---
Yep, the patch before was great for stability, then it got worse :(
---
That was my third Biv daily I’ve ever done. I’m missing a whole bunch of recipes. Frankly, it’s really making me think this is a waste of time.
---
The only difference is the insignia? 
---
The one asshat firing a fat man into the crowd of people after the parade finishes 
---
A player that server hops to get away from me trying to collect thier bounty 
---
You learned how to brew hefe tho while doing it 
---
Lakeside Cabins.
---
For no particular reason other than i like the New Gad lakebed area.
---
I can probably craft one on Xbox one later
---
So basically every player on FO76 then. Best of luck with survival mode
---
100%. I want some actual EFFECTS to accompany drug use. I'd settle for the FO4 approach, but...
---
Imagine drugs giving hallucinations (enemies that aren't there for anyone but you? Maybe picking up junk that you think is something valuable, only to find a pack full of rotten meat when you sober up)
---
Vision effects... maybe intense lens flare, or blurry vision.
---
Maybe auditory... sounds from directions where there's nothing.
---
The possibilities are endless and awesome to consider. Then we could get into actual withdrawal symptoms...
---
Inability to sleep. Unquenchable thirst. Intolerance to light or sound. So many things.
---
Please Bethesda, PLEASE. Make those drunkard/ junkie characters something unique to play.
---
That would be absolutely amazing if you still have it! How much would you want for it?
---
SinisterChrisP - will be on from 5pm today
---
I logged in last night at Helvetia in a nuke zone, deployed my power armor which promptly went invisible and I could not enter it, and tried to log out but died before it completed.  Cheers!
---
Is he still there?
---
I just went to bed, but if you have an aae guass for sale, I’ll get back up!!!
---
Sure thing man, looking forward to it. I will say, thanks to the cap limit, I'm not super interested in caps, but if you have something to trade, I'm sure we can work it out. At the moment I'm mostly interested in expanding on the schematics that I don't have, so something like that would be ideal.
---
Oh man this post makes me wish I hadn't given up on collecting known plans and recipes for newcomers. The end of a Fasnacht parade would be the perfect spot to drop all of it. Totally going to start doing this again.
---
Toss em in a shady box in the garage and nom the squirrel on a stick, ignore the stink eye from thy neighbours!
---
I never saw his comment before it got deleted
---
I see \*somebody\* doesn't have chem fiend.
---
I do this once every 5-6 play sessions or so. Go to camp to scrap and bulk, head to the nearest station to sell off piles of chems and purified waters, double check my stash and character loads, sell off the load of moltov cocktails I forgot about, and I’m on my way. 
---
Thanks. I was actually looking for screenshots like these.
---
The only one I use is the beret and that’s only bc it looks good with my armor. Besides that, the rest are already dusty in my stash
---
LOL.
---
 #1 I stay healthy and full strength as a matter of course.
---
 #2 All you get from me iis "How ya doing" to see if you can talk to me. I have had some great experiences with peole I have met with their mics on.
---
 #3 This is ludicrous.
---
 #4 This too. You have a CAMP obsession. 
---
 #5 Mine is always wide open. Anyone can take my Purified and use my stuff. We were in the Vault together and know each other.
---
 #6 The Raiders we always have with us. Bless they evil little souls. ;)
---
Well that can be difficult when there are six plus other player's all doing the same task. It's also not very clear at first.
---
It's good for trash mobs, I prefer the Tesla rifle though.
---
Okay cool. I wasn't sure.
---
I start at the train station and head for the first house, kind of on the right (there's one ghoul that spawns there). Go down the housing line till I get to the golf club, then after golf club take a left through the parking lot next to the tennis court and clear the couple of houses back there. I seem to get lucky with 3 star ghouls often in the housing areas, and there are two big houses (skinny staircase and wide staircase) along the way to the golf club that have 4-6 ghouls each in them. 
---
Part of it too... and I'll admit this is terrible, but part of it is that clearing everything and putting it on respawn timer discourages other people from hanging out and taking my spawns. If I don't, people will hang around and end up killing my spawns over and over. I've tried to get people that want to farm there organized into a group with me to farm it over and over, but it often just makes a mess of things. I'm so much more efficient solo, when I can blow through the whole thing in 8 minutes. 
---
I also hate that glowing mass, hardened mass, and ionized meat are public drops, so taking people along decreases how many of those I get. All of which I'm there to farm - I only eat ionized meat and I farm tons of ultracite ammo so I need the mass for flux.
---
Server also gets weird when people don't take their loot. Sometimes it won't respawn that mob until I loot the public drop off of it (which I don't mind, but I'd have rather killed it and gotten the full loot), at which point it will respawn again.
---
If you tame a mole rat, and mole rats attack you settlement, does your pet get attacked?
---
 my reaction plates are ready, I hope to see dead hundreds of players with melee build 
---
Would love to use Perk Loadout, but you have to use that other website to do it, and the hassle doesn't seem worth it at this point (I'm only level 67). I was looking at the Wild Appalachia timeline on BSG's website and it says that PVP will roll out tomorrow. I'm assuming there will be at least a little patch to implement it, even if most of the code was in last week's patch.  Better safe than sorry.
---
Maybe. Who knows.
---
I do know it works, I did it st my base, it’s just a certain area it will not work in 
---
One of the Charleston random events that you get on your 20th try for the wandering venderbot.
---
Yeah, drills and syringers will sometimes replace the legendary item... Bethesda said it was fixed but the issue still appears. 
---
Newb players that think power armour is "full strength" and blames everything on TSE weapons :) 
---
I'm Merrowench :) and you can have it for free 😃 
---
Fast travel to Abby's bunker and head straight north. There's a Hermit crab that spawns on the highway.
---
I have no friends like this, sadly, lol.
---
You also got the recipe just by doing the quest. Those ones don't give  a recipe reward because you get one at the beginning.
---
Wow, I need to ask for adhesive more often. I totally get what you mean. I'm giving things away a lot too (lvl 80). I am looking forward to vendor selling, but do plan to give stuff away still. Just fun helping people out.

You know... you make a point. Although, I couldn't imagine the cloud a uranium powered vape could produce!

Oh nice! I have an indoor garden but with brewing coming out there is a few more plants I'd love to move inside. I thought I missed out.

I mean just stands there.  I was doing the parade,  activated all the bots, protected them the best I could.   Guy standing at start doing nothing.   4 died 1 survived.   
---
Almost makes me want to buy apple...almost
---
Its got a nice view and it easily defendable.  If it had better recources it would be my fav
---
no
---
I f@#king hate that, no I won't sell my tse lever rifle or my hunters longcoat, as you can perfectly see I'm f#$king wearing it so at would I be selling it lol
---
Guess you hate me then.
---
I have nothing out in my CAMPs, I tend to camp around pre-existing structures, pull out of storage what I need when I need it and put it away when I am done.
---
In fact there are places where I set up camp where you would not be able to tell that is one at all. Don't ask me how, I don't want it patched either.
---
I got my camp levelled for someone else's pleasure and entertainment once. I found the experience wholly frustrating. I made sure I did everything in my power to avoid it ever happening again.
---
I once found a furious dragon
---
I must confess..I’ve been #2... it’s usually to the low levels trying to get their attention to take the stimpaks and water I’m trying to give them lol There really needs to be a “take the bag” emote.
---
You are my saviour! Wasn’t sure how many more runs I could handle! Will Add you when I get on 😁

You can apply this to any mmorpg

I roleplay as ADAM KATZ on  PC occasionally. A raider personality.
---
Im a simple jewish raider, looking for fix up a motorcycle and head east. My cousin has some power armor waiting for me. Just gotta get to 95 and head north. Gonna fix up my bike and hit the road with my girl. So im looking for some gears... Shaking people down for junk to fix my bike
---
My name isnt important... But my gang The Buckle Biterz will live on forever.
---
I usually get 45 caps and a stimpack.
---
I can kill you in PVP.
---
Let’s get to know each other.
---
&gt;The first two players werent assholes. They were just playing pvp. You chose to take workshops and not have on pacifist. This is going to leave you open to misunderstandings. You shot them, they thought you wanted to pvp so they retaliated in kind. Just because you lost your junk to them doesn't mean they are an asshole. They probably didn't want to deal with retaliation and so just left the server.
---
I accidentally shoot them once and take off running for my life. This guy is obviously looking for a fight and his PVP strategy is to run me to death. I'm glad they looted me, that's the first step in avoiding confrontation or retaliation. I get it. 
---
Most of these people will be leaving for survival mode here soon, hang in there 
---
I've heard the reason she won't land sometimes is that whoever she is aggroed on is on a building or in a tree. So get on the ground and she should come down.
---
I know what you mean, but it's a bit chaotic, and everyone's shooting at thin air most of the time.
---
I was "stuck" at 9/10 for what seemed an eternity one night last week. I don't really server hop, I just usually roll the dice on the server I get. That's probably why I'm LVL 69 with only launching a nuke ahead of me. However, I've turned that quest off to grind/explore the Wasteland to totality.
---
Anyway, I'm jump around from FT to FT and just couldn't seem to find any legendary anythings.
---
Decided to call it a night and put my player to bed.
---
FT to my CAMP, boom 2* radstag staring at me as I shake off spawn.
---
Took it out, got commendations needed, went to bed.
---
That just means (to me?) you never know what's coming your way.
---
Keep grinding!!
---
What goes around comes around. Hate on.  
---
That’s also my other favorite. I have six or so masks, but I’m not worried about the rare ones. I don’t have the time to chase the rare ones
---
Where is forbidden knowledge at?
---
which version do you have? who is reading it? one person or a whole cast?  the one i have is one person, i forget who it is, but he has a very annoying high pitched voice so id love another version if you could recommend one
---
Xbox
---
Thanks friend.
---
Hadn't thought of the theft element! But yeah, I think it has potential and would effectively remove the need to have a bunch in the Stash given how much they weigh. As it stands I wait for Poseidon to be operational (never doing that quest again until they make it so quest markers actually mark quest items...), plug in the Fusion Core generator wait around till I've got 10 and that's me for a while.
---
For the few bad ones I have met in game I have met far more people who are always willing to help you out. This is a game that is meant to be played with other people and I always try to help out when I can and have received help when I needed it to. Pretty awesome community here imo.
---
&gt;That’s exactly what everyone who has a argument is saying,
---
it is literally not though. case in point: this exact thread...
---
&gt;there are even people who think that Bethesda didn’t even put the masks in the game
---
so? frankly, im not completely convinced myself. if they are in fact in the game, the odds are astronomical, and i don't get why you would advocate for that in the first place. there are literally so few that *maybe* two people have come forward with the masks themselves. the only other evidence we have is a handful of random sightings. the event has been run literally *millions* of times. let that sink in. if the drop rate was really .03, that means that at 2 million runs (a conservative count) 60k masks should have dropped. where are these masks? why are there like 5 pictures of 2 of them? with that many drops, there it is borderline statistically impossible that we don't have a picture or video of the actual drop itself a day before the end of the event on any platform of social media, especially with all of the controversy this has stirred up.
---
&gt;what everyone who has a argument is saying
---
and i used meticulous wording for this reason. anyone who has a *coherent argument.* saying "everyone should get one just because" is not a coherent argument. that is the definition of entitlement. a definition you're clearly not familiar with. people suggesting that their efforts should be rewarded with slightly increased odds is hardly entitlement. we are just asking for our efforts to be recognized on some scale. it is not, on any level, entitlement - the belief you have the right to something. 
---
it has nothing to do with a "generation of entitlement" so you can get that shit attitude out of here too. everyone getting a reward is not the same thing as people thinking that serious efforts should be recognized. i don't get how anyone could think a lottery-scale drop rate is more preferable or fair to allowing someone to get a leg up because they put in the hours. at 15 min/run, not counting failures and time spent server hopping, i have spent 30 hours grinding 113 runs. i don't believe they should just give me a mask, but my odds should not be the exact same as some rando who shows up once. im not entitled just because i believe the fact that i put in an entire day of my life should count for *something.*

I am not a fan of the overall "ERR'BODY IN POWER ARMOUR" players for sure. I showed up as Fasnacht last night, and I was the only guy NOT 100% kitted out like a BoS recruit.
---
Players who have 100% ZERO interest in any type of interaction... not even a wave hello. 
---
The slappers, of course. The "Fight me" bunch that refuse to take no for an answer, and see any unwillingness to PvP as "please follow me everywhere and make my game suck now please".
---
As for #5... I'll confess that one of my characters will rob your extractors all day long if you don't lock them. ANY lock at all, and I won't pick it. I tend to lock my stuff with level 0 locks, just to keep the creepies out, but any player with a bobby pin can get in no problem.
---
Nice! Rocking a similar set up, and working in building a friend’s base at Seneca rocks, it does not want to work! 
---
Should probably wait until level 50 to do Mayor for a Day since the weapon you get as a reward (All Rise) is very good but scales to the level you are when you complete the quest.
---
Players that constantly request trade with anyone near them. 
---
The Age of One-Shot is nigh
---
I most likely won't play the mode as I'm too casual for it, but I am hyped for the stories and battles that we will hear of.
---
Hopefully some good battle content makes it too the interwebs.
---
At least this is going to be addressed,  as they mentioned pacifist mode extended to camps under review.   
---
This is actually fine. My first camp was in a ruined house near the fire breathers. But i couldnt use the bed so i left.
---
Whoa. That sounds like a bug but I wish I also had this bug. I’m desperately trying to find bright headlamps for all my sets. 
---
Of course! Enjoy your life!
---
Ever played Halo? The guys in the competitive playlist play the more laid back playlist for easier competition and to warm up. I sure hope that’s not what happens here. But, you could very well be right and I appreciate the thought at the very least.
---
Remind me in 96 hours.
---
If you decide to go the lever action route can mod one free for you. Also have 200+ excess screws I'd let go cheap. 
---
VATS
---
Nope you won't. 
---
Then they want to trade with you after you finish with the vendor
---
Yeah, but there needs to be some sort of shop system. Something to let players know that you are wiling to sell/buy items.
---
You don't and that's part of the fun of a good game. A really good game will do that to you. WoW in it's prime was the absolute worst. It's all I wanted to talk about with friends / family, and I knew they could care less, so I just didn't say anything. Any free time that wasn't spent in game felt like wasted time. Now, I sit on Reddit all day pretending to work. I get my actual work done in like 1 day per week, rest of the time is just pretending to be busy while browsing FO76 forums and Discord.
---
I look forward to more of your stories.  
---
Okie, add me, GT :RacketMaestro55 
---
You can redeem them for prizes and I’m trying to get the mr fuzzy costume which in total is 450 tokens
---
I'm just surprised they seemingly packed all of this into Patch 7, considering we haven't heard anything about a patch or even downtime tomorrow.
---
I agree.   
---
This is what I do now that I'm done with the main game.  When I get a bunch of plans/recipes I usually stop by the front of Vault 76 or one of the close train stations and dump a bag of goodies.  Hopefully the new guys learn to look at the paper sacks.
---
he was like, "Owl get back to you about those"
---
Holy heck wow. What. 
---
It's not RARE if everyone gets one. Also if you have to do around 70 runs to get that lvl, then I'm out. I don't want to grind the same thing over an over, like 10 times in a day for 7 days straight. Not me. I'm fine with what I get I'll just sell my extras later.
---
I fought a skilled 3 man tactical team taking my munitions factory. 
---
1 melee, one PA shotgunner, and one stealth sniper.
---
I came out ahead in caps, and it was the most fun I have **ever** had at a workshop, but running solo you **will** die to teams. It's inevitable, and is going to be the biggest hindrance to solo snipers. Plus, berry mentats remove any defense you have as a stealthy sniper.
---
If I was going to do it right, I'd have the "bait" in sentinal or cavalier armor, and two/three gankers just waiting for you to pop a shot.
---
(Reminder to self, find a gank group before Survival starts)
---
When do you play? I don’t mind playing with people but I usually play during the day - when kids are at school 🤣🤣 and there will be toddler noises in background 🤣

So I read stuff saying taming them and leaving makes them disappear, but that doesn't seem to be the case to me. Every time I tame one it takes off sprinting for my camp but like it has unlimited AP and I can't keep up. It'll charge into danger before I can save it. Instead I just leave. I'll server hop and fast travel all over the map, and usually when I think "maybe it didn't work" then it shows up at ny camp. It's worked every time for me after I tame a sloth.
---
Oh yeah. I tried that and it targets the bots you're supposed to defend or that lvl 200 guy in full PA
---
Oh you know what. Even pre patch I tried to move a water purifier indoors for my brother at his base and it wouldn't let me. Even though I could do it at mine. Maybe it has something to do with being the owner of the camp or just a party member. That would be my only guess.
---
i eat them raw, along with chicken thighs, sloth meat, honey etc. didn't even know they went to a drink recipe!
---
im out here grinding this event, aint got no time to be running off and getting food, plus i need to save my wood for woodbot.
---
People who want to pvp with retaliate when you initiate. Just because you ran after the first hit doesn't mean pvp should end. 
---
If I was that player I would have run you down too. For all they knew you wanted to pvp and then after taking a big chunk of damage decided it was a bad idea and ran.
---
This is why pacifist mode exists. It's to prevent these mistakes in initiation of pvp. 
---
Yes as you can see you have a number of options.  I've actually used this to negotiate pricing before with a seller.
---
I think, and I don't know this 100%, but I'm assuming if you're attacked by the same type of creature as your pet then no, they won't be bothered, but they also won't fight the same type as them. I think it was like that in 4 so I'm assuming.
---
Players i hate. People who dont mindntheir own damn business and get involved in matters that dont involve them. Its my choice to lock you out of my camp its mybchoice to fight people and its my choice to do what inplease without people like you making post about it. If you dont like other peoples decisions then you got issues of your own and probably donthese things your self so dont be a hypocrite its just a dang game
---
3ish eastern time
---
you get wanted for lockpicking. thats dumb. If you didnt, locking up wouldnt bother me.
---
But also, i leave my stuff unlocked cause i dont mind people taking stuff.
---
Now that you mention it I do believe the game gives me more melee than anything else and that's what I've been using more than anything.  As far as the prefix...I mostly use instigating and I almost never see it drop
---
Okay so any TSE or FE will be the top contenders then thank you.
---
&gt; When the sloth works properly, every person who got in a shot can loot it.
---
So don't fucking one shot it with some explosive piece of shit.
---
You can but ive been farning the location and ive pnky seen it 3 times so its a hit or miss 
---
I guess I am taking my friends out to dinner tonight and open a tab while I am at it.
---
They share the same issue of people camping where they spawn too lol
---
Do we know how Adventure mode fast travelling and then joining Survival Mode will work? Can I fast travel somewhere on Adventure, then log into survival and I'll be there? Or do we start at Vault 76 or our camp?
---
I'm really worried about how many ways there will be to get around the mechcanics that survival mode introduces.
---
I'm not being rude and just asking cause I myself did this when I first started playing. Did you place items into your stash or the overseer's box? No offence in this post.
---
I've played this game since beta. I've only encountered 1 griefer, ever. He tried to kill me with slap damage when I was low level, so I just blocked him and switched servers. I've never had anyone try to destroy my camp, or be jerks. 
---
People either ignore you and go on their merry way, or they are more than happy to give you anything you need.
---
This community is great :)
---
I like how evil you are!

i have drop screens, but its in russia  language :)  [https://imgur.com/a/AYZYykp](https://imgur.com/a/AYZYykp)

I just started playing last night on PS4. Someone was outside the bunker when I came out and dropped a bunch of stims for me. It was so nice. I don’t know how to communicate on PS4 since there’s not proximity chat and I don’t have a keyboard hooked up so I couldn’t say thanks 😞

Leader of the pack: 3-4

Uranium Fever: 3 (maybe less if unlucky boss spawns)

Surface to Air: Scorchbeasts with turret assist as fast as you can kill them

His fucking gamer tag was like somethingSLAYSU 
---
I think he was actually coming to initiate PVP with me. 
---
I'm a shotgun in da face type of guy,  with a hint of knee-capping....
---
I can't wait for survival. Ever since the Beta i have prepared my build for pvp. I can say confidently that i can survive anything the wasteland throws at me.
---
I'm wondering about glitched/foundation bases letting people top the survival time scoreboards.   
---
Distant Thunder always has lots of scorched clustered. I've tried it on the sbq at over 900 damage and it seemed pretty lackluster. Tried it in PvP to the same result. It isn't too bad for motivating people not to build their base behind the Whitesprings club house though.
---
What are you talking about? 
---
Lore states vaults hold 1000 People. When V76 opened, there should have been 1000 people walking out to colonise the region of Appalachia.
---
Cities? No, absolutely not, I didn't even mention them and neither did Alfa. But there should be human NPC;s and more human players in one server/world.
---
Munitions before the patch that made stashes breakable. You could make that place an impenetrable fortress. 
---
Now, it's still Munitions, just because of all the action that happens there when you own it.

0.03 change to get one of the 5 rares making the odds kinda like a lotto and more like a come play the game with no content with fake promises we did say it drop mind as well push it harder and make it 0.001 so then nobody really gets it and specifically really on duper’s and other ways

I feel like a lot of my play time is devoted to clearing my inventory actually.... inventory management is a huge pain in the dick.

My IGN is Sharkweather
---
Says who? Most people I talk to don't run it because they say they don't like running low health builds, so to me, that seems like yes, it's very very good, but it's also a big sacrifice you're doing for that damage. IMO it's worth it, but a lot of people don't seem to think so.
---
I am looking for a bloodied gauss 
---
The nuka cola plant can have low level ghouls and a few nuka cola, as well as possible power armor pieces. On top of Poseidon energy plant is a hazmat suit, minigun and bobble head. Razorgrain can be a good source of food and water if you plant in your camp and make razorgrain soup. There is a lumber place near the overseers camp that you can get a lot of wood from.
---
My hope is Bethesda is logging the event so they have statistics of how many times it's been run and how many of each reward dropped.  So they can look at the numbers and decide if there's a problem with the algorithm they have for the drop rate and perhaps increase it.  I don't think they realize the actual drop rate is as bad as it is.
---
Aww, that was my first
---
This might bring me back to fallout 76
---
Look, I can tell you're one of those people on reddit who just likes to argue with people, critiquing anything they say and always bringing up the reasonable doubt like it was the most likely situation. I'm not going to argue with you. I am going to turn on Pacifist mode, because regardless I can't actually defend myself. 
---
HE CALLED THE SHIT POO! 
---
oh wow never seen that, granted i dont trade very often at all
---
ill have to mess with it tonight, thanks for the heads up!
---
I would given you 201 caps lol
---
Don’t be shy, I got 1,800 ranged damage with your name on it!
---
The way VATS chooses to target things is horribly flawed in general.  You could have your crosshairs on a Scorchbeast, hit VATS, and it will target a Scorched Conqueror a mile away instead.  I have no idea what's so difficult about prioritizing the thing I'm currently looking at, or assuming that this is what I want to VATS.  IMO, in Pacifist Mode, it should outright never target players unless A: They are hostile or B: I manually flip over to them.
---
The enemy respawning is something that also deserves some tweaking.  Early on, I used to like jumping into the fray and helping others fight, only to realize that my very presence had a high probability of getting them stuck in the first place by spontaneously respawning everyone.  This isn't a design that promotes interaction and, again IMO and as a general rule, I really don't think enemies should respawn if the player who visited the area is still there.
---
What section of the map is that in?
---
thanks for making our lives a bit easier 
---
When I don't have anything to do I go to the oversee camp and drop plans/ junk/ weapons and try to help lower level ppl.
---
It's nice. 
---
Ah! I never tried. 
---
Destiny did this with Escalation protocol. If you dont get a certain item (usually the Ikelos Shotgun) your chance of getting it the next time is greater. I forget the exact amount but if you ran it a certain number of times with no drop youd be almost guaranteed to get ir
---
I plan on tuning into Twitch to watch some of the mayhem.  Can't wait.
---
These ranks have been uselessly wasted. Could have bound these ranks to PVP, like you had in old times in World of Warcraft in PVP.
---
I know the feeling.  I'm at max budget.  Mine won't even let me place a succulent.
---
So what? Many players have gamer tag with things like that. 
---
Your story has the player in among the HIGH level ghouls. That player probably spawned them and was killing them. Even if the player was going to initiate pvp, 5 hp wasn't going to kill you and multiple hits without you retaliating would let them know you are not interested in pvp.
---
I have not encountered this issue.  Can you tell us more about what types of items were in storage?  I notice you mentioned crops, walls, and turrets, is that all you had stored between sessions?  Also what platform are you on?  It may be worth submitting an actual service ticket with all of this info to [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) as this seems like an actual bug.
---
i know this post is old, but how much are you looking for for leather coat?
---
Making them so rare encourages duping.
---
I've given up tbh. I've tried my best but I could be trying for a thousand hours with no luck.
---
I'll just buy a duped set.
---
Thanks Bethesda.
---
In Pacifist mode you still target other players?
---
I find this concept... pleasing.
---
I spent hundreds of hours - before SIM Settlements was 'a thing' - building my settlements in FO4.
---
Even after the gem that is that mod I still reserve some settlements to build them myself.
---
If that they comes I welcome the challenge of trying to blend in a CAMP with an existing derelict location in an immersive way without the help of Place Anywhere... at least until private servers are 'a thing'.
---
yeah it could be like the fermentor for alcohol! pop it in, wait a bit, and check later, its refilled! hooray!
---
I, on the other hand, killed a tabby cat, took the cat meat, and when my 13 year old daughter got home I told her all about it and showed her the cooked meat.
---
Don’t touch my CORN!
---
Can you not do enclave events for commendations anymore?
---
Southeastern edge of the map.  Danger Zone!
---
I couldn't agree more. I'm on XB1 and met random players that just wants to craft me stuff and give away plans. I pay it forward by doing the same to others regardless of levels.
---
Some players just build really nice Camps to welcome anyone to utilise. Small gestures like this really restore Appalachia ;) 
---
Camp building storage - the tab next to recent and blueprints, not the actual storage chests.
---
Really?   If so, that sucks because it no longer drops (Although I have it already).   
---
Well, I figure that breaking into someone's house is 'wrong"... soooo... yeah,  you get wanted... makes sense to me. Dude, you're busting into someone's house.
---
I leave my stash box outside, though.
---
I will check today when I’m on, and I feel your pain, I’ve crafter sooo many and scrapped it’s disheartening lol 
---
This is correct. My first camp was sucking 100 juice out of a substation before I realized it wouldn't stay at that level of power.  
---
I don't personally feel the time investment is worth it while playing solo, it's a neat quest though.
---
Is every part of the body receiving same damage? Mobs can vary quite a lot, depending on where you hit them.
---
I'm following this tread with a lot of interest 😁
---
No worries..bear me in mind, I will be around. Add me to friends 
---
Hmm interesting. Is it a legendary dragon? If you tell me yours, I'll tell mine.
---
I've leveled a char way past 50 and killed SBQ without touching the main quest. Scorched immunity is just through plot armor too.  Shame really as I was really impressed with how scorchbeasts fight and infect other things.
---
I mean, it is a parade.
---
But in general, I wouldn't say no to a moratorium on quests involving slow-moving Protectrons.  There are way too many of them in the game and the schtick is pretty old.
---
I like the idea. Kovac Muldoon drop style but it's legendary gear, rare plans and outfits, in boxes that are public loot. 
---
I played a game called Rend that is open world survival and it introduced rare artifact gear that could only be obtained via "gifts from the gods", which were big viking style chests that rained down and had big beams showing their location. The gear had unique effects that you couldn't get anywhere else, like reducing the weight of raw resources by 50%, increasing your harvesting yield (lot of harvesting in that game) by 50%, or doing two shots at once with half the attack speed on bows. The mad dash to get an artifact when you saw that beam in the sky was really fun, and lead to a lot of pvp conflict in high level contested areas.
---
how much? 
---
Well we already had those random automatic gun fire hallucinations that followed you everywhere when the game launched.  That was from chem use...right?
---
I used to drop the legendary I got from the sloth, because it was always something I didn't need.
---
But now I've given up on the sloth anyway and just focus on the wolves. I think it is pretty sad how greedy people are in that regard so I stopped taking part in it. (The fact that he didn't drop anything I needed probably helped)
---
wow, arent you special. everyone look at him!!! 
---
Lol...good reply, if I had an AAE Gauss..I would never sleep!
---
I'm checking what I have..be right back
---
Every day we stray further from the light.
---
As if this game doesn't have enough PA in it already.
---
This is exactly what happens. Everyone says to turn in more technical data, yet the data only shows 1 in my inventory no matter how many I pick up and still only stimpacks and ammo. 
---
It must be broken 
---
Oh wow I was way off. My bad. Yeah that seems really strange. 
---
2k and people actually pay that 
---
Leader of the pack nets you 3-4 commendations and the enemies are lvl 10
---
Friday night on PC, someone nuked whitesprings, then nuked directly east with the edge of the nuke touching the white spring nuke.  The train station roof was safe, but the awning on the east side was in the zone.
---
Then they nuked directly east of that - same touching edge.  This one covered Westek.  Westek was totally useless because the supermutants were no different than when they aren't nuked.  Looking at the map, there were three circles in a row - perfectly aligned.
---
It's really the presence of other people that makes it.  It's the same thing with Scorched Earth.  On their own, both events are tedious and pretty boring after the first time.
---
 you must know  BOS Initiate Paint 
---
I just keep too much junk, in case my next CAMP is a concrete bunker with 500 lights.  I just may need that 400 copper one day.
---
When you hop three servers in a row to escape from slap damage you get frustrated.
---
You so salty. 
---
How much do bloodied and vampire gauss rifles go for both 1 star 
---
OH SHI -
---
I know cats are tameable (I even had one for a few days before she randomly stopped spawning), but I thought it'd been proven that dogs weren't even in the game. Fuck yeah!
---
I think there’s two more with the dead dogwood events. Agility to bury the barrels and another one to turn on the windmills I forget.
---
There are 20 red hot blooms in front of the main white spring building.  With green thumb, that's 40 raw crimson flux
---
Should mention I'm on Xbox 
---
whats 2k? xD srsly pocket money...at some point there are no better things u can spend them on so meh...
---
Mostly it was crops, a few of each type.  Outside those I had some basic building items like a few foundations, walls, a few stairs to help me get on my roof when I needed to repair power connectors if some griever decided to wreck stuff.... Luckily nothing hard to replace. 
---
I certainly seem to, although like the Scorched Conqueror, I never make it happen on my own.  It's what VATS, for whatever reason, thinks is important.
---
It's the Northern most workshop on the East half of the map, very top of them map above the Red Rocket workshop.
---
Nah, we get the other masks by going to Helveita IRL and burning one of the inhabitants.
---
Unfortunately I won't be able to get off work tomorrow so I won't be able to check the theory out.
---
I hope they redo the event next year -- then I'll be able to book some holiday time.
---
ha! same here on replays. He starts in with his monologue and I'm nope..nuka grenade!
---
Best of luck, I'm also grinding for Fuzzies and it feel like it will never end. I'm at 86 now and I can't even count how much dross I've tossed and rancid hot dogs consumed. We'll get there one day!
---
More people would do that if they knew it would increase their chances...
---
Ive watched MxR do a Fallout 4 Frost playthrough awhile back. Not something I would want to do but fun to watch him get one shoted nonetheless.
---
Billings Farm has lots of corn but I've never tried nuking it.
---
I took a Furious Prime Gatling gun out on her last night it was incredibly powerful.
---
Then again I'm a heavy build, with a dozen mutations and was drinking high voltage hefe and had psycho popped so that might have contributed.
---
Anti armor black powder pistol. I recently switched from auto pistols to single shot due to the vats and critical nerfs from last update.
---
Well... You do have a mic
---
yeah its wrong. If you blow down their door/wall to get in, then you should get wanted. Picking the lock should be considered sneaking. 
---
You hit up any number of these "Woe is me, I'm at my Cap limit and have nothing to spend them on!" players. 😂
---
That was patched and we don't know if set camps will carry over. Hopefully they do not.
---
Why the salt, friend?  I was simply expressing an opinion.
---
The grind is for real I’m only at 51 and it’s so continuous the least they could do is give us 8 or something a day instead of 3-4
---
Oh im gonna touch your corn. Im also gonna frollic through your grain too!
---
You need green thumb and good with salt perks for flux farming, it makes life so much easier. If in doubt farm thr other mats first then tun around picking plants.
---
Dont be mad for not having friends
---
You can definitely trade power armor pieces individually.  You cannot however trade them with paint from the atom shop.  But I assume paints found in game would stay on the pieces.
---
Yea the game is super discounted so you could probably pick up the game for 20 bucks again, sucks about the progress but 500 bucks are 500 bucks
---
Ive tried the emoji wheel that comes with the game. Still doesn't work.
---
Dang I remember when everyone was looking for it people were hoarding the plans lol how much they go for 200?
---
It should target the highest level enemy in the area. I suppose with pacifist mode off it should be another player in that situation. But, then you're very vulnerable and some people have really evil fantasies that they can carry out in video games without repercussions.
---
I want to be peaceful but I also want the ability to hunt assholes and destroy them and their CAMP if it's kill or be killed. 
---
&gt; By now u should know that everytime you burn that pile of wood you are probably burn a dead body with it
---
A dead body?  That's pretty weak.  Most traditions would have us use [a live one](https://ok.ru/video/333489638136).
---
hah!
---
Honestly, though, I think my idea has merit. Imagine Appalachia crawling with tweakers and junkies. Watching some dude firing at nothing, or chasing something that isn't there. Running around naked because in his game he's fully clad in armour, but not the rest of us?
---
I dunno, I think it would add some "fun" and make people actually think about using them in game... great benefits, but some horrible downsides, too.
---
Agreed. I ‘m hoping everything in his room becomes available. I did find a bunch of Nuka Colas there yesterday, when I stopped by. It would be great to be able to craft different Nuka Cola flavors!
---
So where is the part where you got cheated?
---
Not the grain! I’m gonna sic my Moo Moo on you.
---
I don't do anything anymore because some obnoxious jackass with an explosive gatling plasma obliterates everything the moment it spawns.
---
If the event actually needs defense, I'll shoot, or throw a grenade, but most of the time it's not needed at all, and I'm comfortable just idling by the church.
---
Because high lvl players have absolutely nothing else to do.  Running through all the known best loot places throughout the world is just as in mind numbing.
---
Dont be mad i choose to lock my door lol . break it down its easy plus gives me a lil target practice. You being the one thats salty. ;)
---
I've seen Distant Thunder mentioned a couple of times.. I don't believe I've come across that one, iirc, is that in a quest line or event?
---
Lemonade ?
---
Oh yeah! Well im gonna milk her!
---
You have a thing against me sitting on a bench and collecting loot while I make a sammich IRL?
---
Nice. I have a explsoive harpoon launcher, it stacks with heavy weapons perks. It packs a serious punch.
---
For a plan I've gotten 5 times and that's with lack of trying suppose it all comes down to how much somebody wants it. 
---
That's a weird integer overflow
---
I am sure glad some folks got to laugh about it; I sure did after the fact. It has been refreshing to not have the STASH max'd out.
---
Well, sneaking through someone else's house when they not home... it... ya know... Break &amp; Enter. Just sayin'. 
---
Ok I'm PS4 but bloodied gauss one star..unmodded..around 500 min price, fully modded..2K add another 1k if the Gauss is 2 star and if it's 3 star..min of 5k but I would want 7-8
---
Yes! The calcium makes my bones strong!
---
I think it's kind of funny to be honest.  I think it would be funny to drop one on a peaceful location like Flatwoods or the overseers camp. 
---
I lost a bunch of punji sticks the other day in the same fashion. XB1 
---

---
It's going to be a "who sees who first" game. A Sent/Ass build will die just as easily in one shot as power armor build if he's moving or gets staggered. The thing that pisses people off is that, assuming you see eachother, the SentAss build can do full damage to you (which is shockingly high amounts, like 1 shot on any decent ranged weapon) and not take any damage from you.
---
I also just can't see myself doing my normal farming activities in Survival mode. Why risk it? Not enough reward vs. risk. They should increase the spawn rate of 3 star legendaries and make them guarantee a 3 star drop if you kill one to incentivize it further. EXP boost? I'm level 315 on main, and have a 111, 72, and 42. Any exp gained through the boost will be lost when I die and have to run back, thus losing farming time. Doing my normal farming routes like Nuked Whitesprings will be a no go considering how heavily camped it will be.

I just don't see any reason to do this unless you're running a full SentAss build or CavAss build and walk around stealthed looking for people to one shot. And to be honest that doesn't sound very fun to me. Sounds like a lot of walking and not seeing people for very little reward other than bragging rights.
---
Any military installation.  So, Camp McClintock, the different BoS Sites in the Cranberry Bog, etc.
---
Take the perk White Knight and your armor will cost significantly less Ballistic Fiber to repair and last longer to begin with.
---
There are worse uses for PTO!
---
On ps4 how much on Xbox or pc , server hoping will yield a plan... so if you have the key lol 
---
I have .50 and .50 ball and no guns I have use that ammo. I had a black powder pistol that uses the .50 balls I looted off an enemy but it was like lvl 40 and I was lvl 27 when I looted it.
---
I ended up selling it rather than having it take up valuable stash room.
---
lol yeah pretty much see that one coming.
---
That is your experience, I have about 940 hours in now, have taken workshops now and then. At least 80% of the time it turns ugly. But on ps4 , maybe less grief on your platform 
---
PC - but thank you for offering. I'm going at it alone as it was entirely my fault.
---
If you go to white springs and make a loop around the property killing ghouls at the golf clubhouse and the the cabins and what I call the motor pool. Good xp. It is good to do when it gets nuked. They all turn into glowing ones.
---
Aae and tank killer have kept these bloodied sentinel fools away from me. Some guy tried to grief me yesterday and I just kept putting him down with aae handmade. Eventually he raged out of the server. 
---
Well, if you are gonna let yourself in, at least wipe your feet. 
---
Where is your mind at! lol
---
There should be a speedrun version that has assaultrons instead of protectrons lol.
---
Nuka-Grape
---
locked door should mark an area as a tresspassing zone. If they see you, then you are wanted. If not, then you wouldnt know who pickpocketed you anyway,
---
I guess they were happy you played along with what they wanted? 
---
I had something similar going on the other night. I tried to buy plans from someone, and their Assaultron Blade plan showed 4294967295 copies in MY side of the trade window when he set a price on it, but showed he only had 3 in HIS inventory trade window. We ended up dropping it on the ground to complete the sale. It was so weird. 
---
I’ll pay 550 if you want to hold it till around 7pm CST
---
 Yeah but I like the idea of having a fusion core maybe a plasma core charger as well. 
---
Or if all the power plants have fusion core machines workshops that would be ok.
---
They are the only source for most of the brewing recipes.  So I do them every day.
---
Plus, talking to Biv is a reward in and of itself.  You ever wonder what’s it’s like to be...  what’s the word for “not drunk”?
---
I’ll buy plasma cores 5 caps per core
---
How can you craft it?
---
No i wouldn’t make sense ( a new line of coding just for breaking , risking the bugs coming with it ), selling in the other hand and increased pool sizes to vendors will work for the problem.
---
Ability to sell like on earlier itinerarios of the game , and increasing the vendors from 200 to maybe 400 will help the situation with unwanted caps , base price 1 cap per 1 ammo
---
I hate people who are at full health and wear Power Armor. 
---
Dude, what?
---
What if we are BoS recruits?
---
I did, I also took my shoes off at the door as to not track outside bateria! Muahaha!
---
I don't know which servers you all play on but I have never gotten any help excapt from team mates occasionally. I mostly play solo and have seen more than my share of assholes and griefers. Especially when I claim a workbenches. Seems like almost every time I do some dick about 60 levels above me has to come and claim it.
---
Then there's the people who like to bust up my camp. Now they can do some damage without getting a bounty on them. I even had one guy try to lure a scortchbeast over to my camp. He failed when the SB killed him.
---
So as a result of all this I ignore lower levels now and if I have weapons and armor I no longer use I either scrap, sell or throw in a river.
---
If they do slap damage just walk away, let them use the vendor and unload into their back which is now full PvP. Get some easy caps and junk.
---
its a new drink added in the same patch as brewing, theres a new npc that sells it along with recipes
---
You can craft serums for all mutations if you can get a hold of the recipie
---
Man, I'm still trying to get through the main quest lines. Can't really do events until I get down to fast travel weights.
---
I quest and scrap and farm and take my time, and I'm at your level. My husband got tired of that and has taken to running face first and totally unprepared into Whitesprings and I farm repair supplies for him when I play solo. He's leveling much faster.
---
Apparently the Leroy Jenkins school of leveling works well in this game.
---
Players that beat me fair and square at pvp because they are better. Assholes
---
Not gonna be that guy but are those masks really worth running this event 70+ times ?
---
Pretty sure it shares with the watoga market vendor. When I found the lemonade vendor it was out of caps already and I never sell to the Charleston bot vendor. He never spawns for me
---
Way too low man i'd rather throw them in the mire.
---
yeah and who gets the caps. some vault tek rep in 63 ?
---
It happens when an item bugs out. If you log out/in the item will disappear along with the millions of components it “contains”.  I had it happen with a giddy up buttercup and it said I had 4 million or so screws which I didn’t really have. 
---
I got all 10 of mine from the parade. Took a few hours and a few shots.
---
there was a cat literally right next to my camp. Never shown up. Also a possum nearby that never shown up.
---
holy what!
---
u/ladydevann
---
Explosive not so great in PVP. All someone needs is Fireproof or Dense armor...
---
I assume you modded it with flechette ammo? I imagine that lowers the explosive damage per hit quite a lot.
---
My thing about the survival mode is Bethesda shouldn't allow you to take your adventure mode character to survival mode but that a whole nother discussion.
---
I’ve tried all weeks got of lot of asshole responses , like if you keep in mind a base price of a token is 3 -5 caps a suit will go for 1500 tops I offered a price similar and the person got so offended never replied again.
---
Got people saying they still spans by fast travelling to several spots but on my personal opinion no luck.
---
I did had the idea of creating a new character and collecting those 9 tokens and mulling them to my main account , since the initial 9 opening quest tokens are still being granted freely.
---
Just NW of Grafton there's a big junk pile of cars and windmills featuring some lights and a crafting bench. I've built a junkers camp intertwined with this tower and it is amazing. I have had no enemy spawns (except 1 angry radstag). 
---
I've embraced the mess.
---
They will refill tomorrow.  The desks are instanced (I think).  Why would you want more than one at a time?
---
MidX
---
I think the fact that one of them lvl 100+ did all the base damaging and then let their friend claim the bounty rather than having the bounty available for the OP.
---
It’s in the upper part of the map. You should still be able to do it even if ur early lvls. 
---
Good to know this isn't the only SPECIAL check in the game. I know BSG is moving away from OG's Fallout's hard core RPG limits, but there's something to be said for a game where your decisions about your character build have consequences.
---
Parades bot can you drop something other then toothy witch soldier owl giant ?
---
Then y'all deserve to be thrown in the brig. Acting like drunk civilians.
---
I'd expect more military precision from a BoS recruit... not uncontrolled fire, and general tomfoolery.
---
I'm ALL for role-playing... but PA does not a BoS soldier make.
---
I think of it went to the extreme of not having your armor equipped that it would get really old really quickly. But some hallucinating and weird sounds would be cool as hell
---
You can place a foundation, drop a doorway, move the foundation, and then replace the doorway with a wall. Fairly well known already?
---
I don't use power so every power core I get I just toss it on the ground.  It's a shame they didn't implement some kind of player vendor earlier, like at launch.
---
I couldn't even tell you the amount of power cores I have dumped on the ground including 100% ones. Shame.
---
GREAT STORY! This is what Fallout 76 is all about 
---
I have a 3* .50 vampire machine gun.  Weighs 90% less and.... I can't remember the other effect
---
Got a guy interested for 900 
---
I suppose that might explain why it goes after the Conqueror, because Scorchbeasts are very low-level for what they actually do.
---
I wish this feature was more widely known!
---
That would be me, and it’s called fireworks. 
---
lol. There is a vendor that says "Please dont stab customers while they shop."
---
I agree . I miss the speech checks and the variety of choices you could make. I kno it’s be hard to do that in this game but still, I feel like its a big part of fallout
---
I think a lot of it is confirmation bias and the human brain seeing patterns. However, I do see patterns so I'm not sure who's fooling who! 
---
I do it, personally. You can still get surprised on occasion, but with 3/3 stealth and the 30+ agility you have from Unyielding, you can be very, very stealthy. I’ve had scorchbeasts literally land on me and stayed in caution. And the damage output gets absurd. All the other benefits of having +15 in every stat (but endurance) certainly don’t hurt, too- at 34 Luck with the right perks, every other shot can be a critical. 15 extra intelligence is that much faster leveling. 15 extra strength is that much more you can carry. 15 extra charisma is that much more you can sell stuff for (as well as sharing 5star perk cards- sharing counts off your total charisma, not base). 
---
I'm going to assume its base only vending. One of the loading screens has 1 of the machines at somebody's base.
---
This is a little off topic and has nothing to do with obtaining the masks, but I found the more you do for the event the better are your chances for getting a legendary item apart from the megasloth drop.
---
I ran the fasnacht event last night and beforehand I gathered all the supplies you need to donate to start the parade, e.g. 50 wood scraps, 10 steins, 12 intestines, 20 radtoad eggs, and 10 beeswax. I found all the robots before anyone else and donated all the items that were required to start the parade, and at the end of the event I received a level 50 troubleshooter's leather arm. 
---
If you play the event right you should walk away with a legendary drop from the megasloth and a legendary drop from the actual event. 
---
Its identical to Skyrim, a release from 8 years ago. The engine was around before Skyrim's release. The engine is a decade old. And it really shows.
---
Objects, flora and building elements are even lifted directly from Skyrim, as are some of the textures. If not directly, then someone has obviously done a cut &amp; paste job to save time. Some of the sound effects are the same as well. 
---
FO76 looks outdated despite being a modern 2018 AAA release, if you can call it AAA and keep a straight face.
---
When will it start costing 40 upwards caps then because im level 45
---
You appear offline to me 
---
Players that are high level and clad in power armour will always be found in Morgantown now because of Biv’s daily alcohol related quests, there are also a number of cap stashes in Morgantown that some have built a cap stash run around, myself included, I have a cap stash grand tour and Morgantown is part of it.
---
Another event has an Agility 5+ check for throwing barrels.
---
Never even thought of that,  brilliant!!!
---
Maybe they launched them.  That’s a thing now that is making its rounds.  They use a floor trap that flings the cows.
---
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
---
Any chance you're still on?
---
facepalm.jpg
---
Nice. Guess it's time to explore more!
---
Did anyone try killing the robot and takingn the rare mask from them?
---
Why you gotta hate on PA users? We farm the hell out of everything and need the extra carrying capacity. Sorry our guns are sometimes better too. I admittedly do just stand on a roof half the time to please everyone. Even my little guns are pretty strong so i only kill what absolutely needs to be killed.
---
I don't bother locking my camp anymore, but i also dont get many visitors. The ones that do definitely dont laugh at it tho.
---
I absolutely agree with this. I was just thinking this over the weekend. I am now working on my second set of PA so that I can have my Excavator set for farming and then a "combat" set that I use when I am questing/event driven stuff.
---
Mb just a token system instead then? Collect x tickets then go buy a reward. Like dailies that award Mr. Fuzzy tokens. I think it's a great concept.
---
Make those extremes for extreme situations. Not the first time you use pyscho… but the 50th time? Man, your brain should be fried, and make it "once in a while", not always. Maybe this time it's visual hallucinations. Maybe after day three of no sleep and endless drug use... things get a little crazy.
---
You probably have one combined with a foundation. Place them down and see if you have one built already. If not then just reset the game 
---
thank you
---
&gt; Rather than bumping to 1000 stash limit, I'd rather you keep it at 800 and add a 200 shared stash. 
---
Yes! I like this. I constant problem I am having is that one character is built for rifles and one for heavy weapons.   I'm constantly finding good legendary rifles with my heavy weapons character and vice versa.  It's a pain in the ass having to use team mates to transfer stuff. 
---
I mean I have it , I was just wondering thanks for the market price check 👍🏽
---
What patch? 
---
As far as I know scorchbeast queen is the only way to obtain them in game. I got a few there and bought some from other players.
---
How terrible to get a guarenteed new reciepe
---
I’ve haven’t bumped in to the lemonade vendor yet , do you need acid for the lemonade ?
---
It didn’t for my testing during patch 6, but given how buggy and inconsistent this game is, I’m not surprised if it doesn’t always work as expected.
---
I did a massive test of slap damage during patch 6, and included some tests of a few reactive damage sources (specifically including reactive plates) to check for “involuntary PvP”, the only one that broke it for my testing was Electrically Charged, and then only when the attacker was Wanted. 
---
Wait so blocking a player and encountering them in the server prevents VATs?
---
I completely agree. I shoot the sloth with a ranged weapon a couple of times then finish the horde. 
---
Yesterday’s I got nuka cola dark but I can’t craft it 
---
This why I don’t trade with 90% percent of people anymore.  Every time I try to trade without fail people try to buy my full set of max vanguard combat armor or my TS handmade and all my 556.  That’s my main equipment  I need it and when I decline I usually just get attacked. 
---
"Neither have I"
---
Just logged off...will log on in two mins.
---
The thing is, yes they might gate other players from destroying your CAMP, but that's not to say enemy NPCs couldn't, or that they couldn't be led into attacking someone else's CAMP.
---
Which isn't to say they should make CAMPs immune - only that I really wish they'd fix the bizarre foundation problems that prevent CAMPs from being replaced.
---
I actually like to build immersivly. In fallout 4, i would use  materials i would expect in the surrounding areas.
---
The do it bubba
---
This is the oldest play in the book.
---
There really are some awesome people in this game. I (level 12) was desperately low on ammo last night, and was scavenging around Morgantown looking for some, when I came upon a camp. Camp owner (level 118), said hi, and asked me how my campaign was going. After some small talk, he dropped a heavily modded hunting rifle, and 250 rounds of .308 ammo, and told me to help myself to water from his purifiers. I was in a rough spot, and he totally saved my ass. Thanks stranger!
---
Most of the plans I got are weapon plans, some mods, and technical data plans.
---
Lol deal! :)
---
Iv'e done the quest line or brotherhood of steel but I haven't found any mods for the ultracite power armor
---
Now online
---
well to be real, i don't think they would ban your disc. don't even know if that's a thing. if they banned, it would likely be your XBL/PP account, as well as your Bethesda.net most likely. the Bethesda.net wouldn't be hard to circumvent, but if they ban your whole online account, you would have to make a new one with an online subscription. it's even possible that wouldn't work, as im sure they could ban your IP, meaning youre *really* screwed. curious if a vpn could get around that though..
---
I didn’t realize it until the last queen run but mine glitched and just kept replenishing the same plasma core over and over.
---
Once I switched to another weapon it properly consumed them again but for that one last fight,  I had essentially unlimited ammo and it was amazing.
---
Whoaaaa maaaan. Faaar out.
---
Happen to me twice already always the same patter guy in chameleon either destclaw hand or power fist or a hammer 
---
Bit high the price init? On the market they are going between 500 and 900 caps with some at a pinch scaling up to 1500 
---
To the low levels putting your shitty camps next to the parade also stop. I don't need more crap to load and cause lag.
---
Im on PS4, and have been having issues with my cores getting used too fast. I had 5 cores, and was bearly able to get through a Censes Violence event. 
---
It feels like they severely amped up the core energy drainage.
---
What? That doesn’t make sense. Are you flagging for pvp? 
---
power armor is about useless in pvp
---
Yes, absolutely 
---
Maybe elaborate on how you were cheated out of cap and mats. I can see how the players were able to destroy your base but not have a high wanted. The teammate of the player who destroyed your base claimed the bounty before you showed up. That is done all the time and is an unfortunate loop hole in how bounties are supposed to work in preventing ass-hattery. Hopefully the new pacifist mode will help prevent unwanted camp destruction.
---
However, you obviously thought you were pvp ready when you started pvp against two lvl 100+ players who from their actions play pvp. That's your messup, lesson learned.
---
Sounds like those aren't random spawns. They need to be from certain locations in the map where random things occur. Sometimes it's a robot selling lemonade, other times it's a lone mega sloth. When you have enough charisma, the animal friend perk maxed, and they're a random spawn you'll get an option to tame, not pacify, and it'll ask you if you want to send them to your camp.
---
Most servers you'll end up on will be full, it's only 24 players per server. It's not uncommon to run into other people, especially in certain areas or doing certain events. As for RP groups you can hang out here, groups sometimes come here to recruit. 
---
Yeah, I have no idea, I was just speculating as to why a 160damage missile was oneshotting a 360hp character. More testing needed; I’m getting so many weird damage results from few different tests I’m doing (trying to test Furious as well)
---
I’ve always told those who ask about the game this exact sentiment - all the people who hate the game aren’t playing it; yet there are still way more people than I could ever interact with who play the game. Those who I interact with are phenomenal 
---
On PC, can login on like a 5th attempt. Scary!
---
Just found this place yesterday after having played since launch.  Also found my first buried treasure thanks to Toxic Valley treasure map #4.
---
Personally I would not pay over 100 caps for a 1 star item
---
Luck 8+ to 'kick' the first windmill you interact with during 'Dogwood Die Off' rather than spending resources to fix it.
---
I found that quite charming.
---
Well, hold on... I deliberately do very little because the low-levels need the XP way more than I do.
---
Also, my character won't kill a bunch of harmless squirrels for their intestines.
---
The engine was created *for* Skyrim. Again, you're showing that you have no idea how software development or forking works. Engines are iterative; you don't just throw one out and make an entirely new one every 5 years just because it's old. This is a very *very* tired argument at this point. Again, Doom Eternal is running on id Tech, which was created for the first Doom in 1993. 
---
Also, objects, textures, sounds effects, and all those things have nothing to do with the engine lol. At best you're muddying your argument here. 
---
&gt;lifted directly
---
&gt;cut &amp; paste job
---
These mean the same thing. 
---
And I'm confused as to why your dislike of this game somehow means that Bethesda isn't a AAA publisher all of a sudden. That's not what AAA means lmao
---
Last two days gave me the recipe for Nuka Cola Dark each day.  I hate getting repeats.  
---
Keep it.  You can 'craft' a new one, but only if you HAVE the old one (it's one of the materials needed).....it's how you level it up.
---
My Lebenspartner actually said this,
---
He’s legitimately quit the game und return to playing World Of Warcraft but he’s watched me run this event approximately seventy plus times now with absolutely no rare mask or sightings of any other player wearing a rare mask.
---
It’s disgusting really - as someone who remained a devoted player of this game despite all they did to make it less than enjoyable I was actually looking forward to this event but as day go by und it is now one day away from the event ending...
---
Still no rare mask, honestly? I feel like I’ve been lied to - as many many people have said, if these mask were in game someone would have posted because it is human nature to post and as they say “Show Off” rare item.
---
I do not believe they are in the game but what I do believe is that Bethesda should get their shit together - fix this lie und extend the event time because this is just disappointing honestly.
---
Even if these masks ended up in the store which I fully believe they will, what is point? The point in rare item is earning it or it take away from it the satisfaction of gaining rare mask.
---
If you see this Bethesda - wake up, people aren’t stupid and it’s becoming obvious more each day that you not only lied to your player base but probably plan on placing these rare masks in the Atom Shop.
---
Because what’s also obvious is that $$$ matters more than pleasing those who payed good money to play this game und took part many times in this event of yours.
---
You should be damn ashamed.
---
Ahhh I thanks for the info.
---
That would make finding what power armor I want to wear easier instead of taking each one out till I found what I wanted
---
I dont hate PA users. I use it myself. Im not talking about the ones using excevator armor. Im talking about the ones in Xo1/Ultracite/t60. As I said, they explore low level areas like morgan town, or even flatwoods. The enemies dont get that strong to even need power armor. 
---
Yes please. My friends aren't always on for transfers and it takes forever. Plus it can cause problems when you have almost identical pieces and didnt take a pic b4 transfer. I want a separate  stash box just for transfers between characters. 
---
TYL what TIL means
---
I never tested it but just stating reasons why maybe they couldn't be targetted. I mean this game is buggy and players love finding ways to exploit it.
---
Just find people in game and interact with them. You can set your mic to area, team, or off. When you come across players turn your mic on area and don’t be afraid to start talking to them. IMO the best people to play with use a mic and are not afraid to chat up strangers. If they won’t use a mic or don’t want to interact then move on. 
---
I've seen them go anywhere from 10-20c on Xbox in fo76market 
---
Well the recipes so far are part of the quest - he goes here's a recipe, make it so I can drink it, he drinks it, he gives me... Greek letters as a reward. His dialogue is pretty funny, I'll give him that tho XD
---
Oddly, that one and Unstable Isotope didn't give us any issues.  Just the Reactive Plates.
---
Thats good to hear.
---
Seriously though, the crafting menu should allow for purified water, favoring boiled over purified until there is none left. I'm tired of using all my wood when I have a TON of perfectly good purified water.
---
Not a problem just sold mine for the agreed price put it up for 1k somebody will pay it 
---
I carry a LE and a semi-auto handmade.
---
LE is for distance sniping, and the handmade has a stinging magazine (armor piercing, and 35 rounds capacity), that gives me a solid defense for multiple up close or fast moving enemies.
---
I've never heard of these ghost items before. We were thinking the next patch might fix it, or is this like some sort of fluke where we need to submit a ticket?
---
OHHHH. It is a random spawn.Sometimes it's cats, sometimes its robots, sometimes, its fireflies, etc. But my charisma is at 4 so I can only pacify. Thank you I will try to respec fore more charisma.
---
Yes if someone is wearing dense armor and has a the fireproof perk, it will do less damage. But still, its a harpoon launcher, it does damge. And if that doesn't work i'll use my prime 50 cal TSE. or my TSE minigun. If you can survive that i'll be fucked, but i have yet to meet the one that can kill me before i kill him. So yeah can't wait for survival.
---
Nope, I can't either login even to the Bethesda Launcher. PC + Europe here.
---
Something is better than nothing in my opinion. Good luck on your spring cleaning sale dude 😁👍🏼
---
Ya, how does he take 300 caps unless he has a bounty already?
---
Fallout 76 is like endless sodomy.  Every patch os another inch deeper.
---
I’m glad!
---
I just buy it. Farming specific junk items can be infuriating. Especially balistic fiber.
---
You're better off farming something expensive like strait jackets at the asylum and buying bulk.
---
Just my two cents. 
---
Yes. Please.
---
I have a good stabby weapon I want to transfer from my rifle character to my hand-to-hand combat guy but don't want to bother the one person who still plays the game.  
---
Oh no I’m sorry to here that.
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
On PC, can't get in.
---
I tried out Hefe and although I saw the effect present on my Effects page, it did not increase any of my energy weapon's damage on paper. Same went for Ballistic Bock on my .50 cal. 
---
Furious weapons are cool, I just wish it didn't take away your stacks when you switch to another target. I've heard it caps at 50%, and if that's true, I'd have to choose between a constant 50% from the Furious effect or 60% from Adrenaline.
---
an acceptale explenation. Morgantown was just an example, but i meant in low level areas in general.
---
Same issue all of sudden(
---
There also needs to be a "no, thanks!" emote.   I've had people offer ammo and such to my alts, who really don't need it thanks to my main.  I'd rather they give the stuff to a real new player.
---
I haven't started playing yet (beyond the beta and about an hour of the retail version). What's annoying about people in power armor?
---
10/10.
---
Make sure you don't have a bunch of low charge cores - had similar issues with gatling laser.
---
Exactly, I am glad to see you are paying it forward.
---
Ill help, im level 46 but im going to play the nee bf firestorm this week but on weekend ill probaly play a few hours
---
GT kennymj
---
People are missing my point,  one other player was with me and stood there the entire time.   If  people are there doing stuff,  fine,  but I was frantically trying to do all of it...
---
I was in a nuke zone recently and there were some bloated ones attacking an assaultron guard. I tried not to hit the guard but accidentally hit it and killed it so the other 2 aggroed on me. I killed one but the other got me. Another player that was nearby watching it all unfold grabbed my loot. He didn't try to save me with a stimpack, that's for sure. Oh well. This is the nature of the game. If I'm teamed with someone and this happens I'll guard their bag until they can claim it.
---
Yeah send me an invite sometime. My gt is Kuso24 and I’m totally willing to build u a base
---
You  can craft the marine assault helmet?
---
All the "special" vendors supposedly share caps inventories with the Watoga Station vendor.
---
yup, its acid, boiled water, sugar, and i forget the 4th thing
---
It's an idea that seemingly gets brought up every couple of days and I can't see why it wouldn't work barring inevitable bugs.
---
What Bloodied weapons do you have?
---
Thats so nice.
---
Like I said it's best offer 
---
Same Problem, i can't log onto the Website either, was playing 10 minutes ago then game crashed and i cant login anymore, says invalid user, or password doesnt match username :-(
---
aye.  apparently this is the error for maintence...but no maint is shown
---
That’s basically raiders. I don’t see an issue. And once the event starts PVP is disabled. 
---
I wasn't wanted, if thats what you're asking. I would try to get revenge and he would kill me again.  Then I would ignore and he would still kill me. 
---
Thats very kind
---
You do know the BoS is made up of deserters right? Also they would be killing peeps who refused to hand over their laser rifles.
---
"Fury time bitches!" - Toazd every SBQ fight. It's a WIP.
---
I like to build a platform and just run around picking up from the collectors, practicing my camp building...I could do that for hours there!
---
Glad to hear it
---
Ghouls Inside Buildings.
---
Ha its fine, just annoying. I knew theyd kick my ass if i engaged. 3 dudes over lvl 200 in power armor vs a lvl 16 me? No chance. 
---

---
same.  been trying for about 15 mins.
---
local pc has issues, so I tried geforce NOW which is run remotely and streamed.  both bethesda clients eventually login but error out saying they cant retrieve the games list and to check internet connection.
---
something must be up server side
---
How did having those mods cause you to lose anything? 
---
Hmm. \*Looks at the 300 cores on his mule alt\*. Maybe those will actually have value now.
---
Or the one where you can build down from a 2nd floor and have floating walls 
---
Sorry, what is 3/3 Stealth?
---
No,
---
In another thread in regards to the rare mask a player specifically said that him und his group of friends tried the elimination process of various robots - from what I recall they tried all variations along with all variations of decorating the barn und so forth.
---
So whichever dev said this is also liar - what a great way to divert from the truth which is they never planned on anyone getting a rare mask.
---
What they probably also didn’t plan on was how intelligent the player base is - meaning they have now basically tried everything, every combination but still not a single sighting of a rare mask.
---
Huh, that's actually a pretty interesting concept. How many technical data plans do you have?
---
Yeah, once I am level 20 I will probably give away my scoped hunting rifle to someone lower level if I can.
---
I wish I could grind for the tokens.
---
Dailies don't spawn for my current toon.  I'm training up another toon to be strong enough to cope with Camden park enemies so I can carry on.  
---
174 tokens and counting....
---
Honestly I'm going to give it a go not strictly as a PVP gamemode and more as regular game minus the training wheels white glove slap. Probably gonna be a mistake but basically just gonna be way more weary of people but not gonna shoot on sight first without reason and still gonna try trade.
---
You should give all your gunpowder to me. For safe keeping.
---
I just put 1000+ shotgun shells to overseer camp for newbies. Now it will be gone after server restart.
---
Believe it or not there are some of us out there ;)
---
I have launched before but I have three kids and if I launch it’s no guarantee I would have much time in the blast zone.  It’s usually easier to happen across them.  The three hours this weekend was a rare occurrence that someone wasn’t crying!   
---
But as you said maybe a launch on a weekend is the best way.
---
Very true
---
I was setting up my first camp at level 7 three weeks ago... Brand new to the game you see. I got everything I needed and even put defences around my camp. Outta nowhere some asshole starts blowing me up and then I died, respawned, died and it just happened this way for a good ten minutes. 
---
So I got real pissed off.. Spawned sort of nearby and I messaged a randomer nearby to see if he could help me get rid of this utter nuisance of a player. Suddenly he runs over and takes out the troll and the troll respawns and he gets taken out again 😂 so the troll leaves and then I get a friend request from this.. This hero of a dude. 
---
He's called Chris. Level 175 bless him. We are good friends now. I'm level 40 because he took me to kill a shit ton of scorchbeasts and ghouls and deathclaws. He's even gifted me two sets of full power armor and I couldn't be more thankful. 
---
This game is a blessing in disguise and I just love the community of people you find here. Chris got me from level 7 to level 40 and still messages me everyday to see if I wanna tag along some more. I sure do!! 🔫 Let's go lmao
---
Same problem. Im trying to redeem the free TES III Morrowind and cant sign in.
---
Keep me updated on what you find. I’ll save this thread so when I get a chance to do some tests and I post my findings.
---
Wish there was a way to see how much numerical damage we do to enemies. But for now I’ll have to find similarly tanky ones and compare HP bars
---
Right. I'm still seeing them on 'adventure mode'.  
---
I am glad there are so many people giving things to others.
---
There appears to be two different quests.  One is a “make me this drink” and seems to automatically give you the recipe to make it.  The other is a test, “drink this type of booze then do something”.  That one doesn’t automatically give you the recipe for it.  But rewards for completing the event can give you recipes.  I have only gotten the first type of quest twice.  The test one I get each day.  
---
It really is.
---
Confession: I lure low level people to the Savage Divide let them fight the enemies. Gotta see if they're Brotherhood material. 
---
The harpoon certainly scares me the most of everything there. It sounds like you use power armor. All I can say for certain is if you stand up at all, you will be dead in one shot.
---
I am on PC if you ever want to play around.
---
If you have a mice there should be proximity chat. I play on PS4 also.
---
We really need sinks. My "Employees must wash hands" sign in the bathroom could use the company. 
---
If it bothers you, log off, and go jerk yourself off and cry yourself to sleep like you do every night
---
Helping others is the absolute most enjoyable thing I do in this game. I’m branding myself as “the mechanic” and as such, I’m spending money on any mods, perks on carrying and building, and my time on collecting Junk so I’ve got huge stockpiles (and overflow of them that I can then sell for caps). Whenever I run into a lower level player, I figure out what they need and provide it all, plus a fully modded gun based on their level/preference. I don’t accept anything in return but for them to have a great time playing the game and keep the friendliness alive. 
---
Through this process, I’ve met the socially awkward, shy, quiet people and even some living with disabilities. They are often the hardest to convince that I’m straight up giving them what might take hours worth of work...but once they realise I’m the one offering, usually open up to me and we have a great time :) 
---
Speaking of which, I haven’t heard from one of my new friends in a while...I’m going to message him now thanks to this post. He provides the best backup against nasty hordes 
---
How can I do that? Given that the fabricator no longer gives me the potion to craft things.
---
Grandfathered in. If you had a bunker before the patch AND don't move camp, you can keep the bunker. However they can never move their camp and keep the bunker.
---
Are you still helping people learn how to make the marine armor helmet?
---
Lmao
---
Hi, the atomic shop will not load for me now since this error was fixed. Its constantly greyed out with the loading icon, anyone else have this issue?
---
Could possibly be used as a binding agent, although that would be redundant as a simple mixture of water and flour is already enough of a binding agent for most baked goods.
---
It's just PvP. Plus once PvP beta comes out you won't see people like that in adventure mode
---
Oh I religiously go there. No dice. Haven't found one there or anywhere in a couple months.
---
I will love it too...
---
Wear the straight jacket and Fasnacht Man mask though. It really pulls everything together. 
---
Lol. I gave two newbies, level 2s, a whole bunch of stims, chems, and even some mid tier legendaries. They also each got a Nukashine. Happy travels.
---
Oooo i found the dog.... buuuuuuut it's scorched and died
---

---
Maybe your suspended for having too much ammo or something... 
---
Get you a .50 cal or Gatling gun and shoot them out of the sky....."We don't need no stinking landing bats"  They swan dive quite well into the dirt.
---
There is also one in the room past the Vault door in the Whitesprings bunker. 
---
I am getting an error on PC, "Unable to connect to servers to verify your bethesda.net credentials."
---
I did that on PC this weekend. Sold like 40K .38 ammo from my mule for 4K caps lol. Then I traded all of my .45, Shotgun Shells, and .308 for .50 Cal. Now sitting on 60,000 .50 Cal ammo for my machine gun. I'll be using that for a very long time lol.
---
Okay but YEA I'm with this.
---
Smoking gives you rad damage + health debuff + ap buff +whatever else. You can grow your own tobacco to avoid the rad damage.
---
Make it happen plz
---
Pro tip: If you want the Nukacola logo for now, the string lights in the Atom store blink it over the walls. Not quite the same, but I found it somewhat satisfying! 
---
More posts are popping up describing this. You are not alone. 
---
On ps4 atomic shop stop working
---
I can join server sometimes
---
You animal. A sloth lives there. 
---
What system?
---
I guess that's fair enough. The cook-station-into-structures one is still doable though.   
---
I had one of those helmets in my inventory before, dropped it on the ground 
---
Gotten to the point I’m using shotgun shells and 5.56 as a second currency. They’re super easy to buy and sell at 2 ammo:1 cap and the price hasn’t moved at all since the Reddit pages went up. 
---
My main character has bandolier/batteries included and that makes most ammo weightless or near weightless. I ship it all over to him and liquidate when I need caps. Works for me. 
---
Huh, I've never had the test version, I guess it's random which type you get. I'll keep doing them a while longer then, see what I get
---
If someone comes to check my CAMP out, I will deplete so many of my resources as thanks... sounds like this guy was equally as proud of his base. I spent literally hours making mine so that it’s this nice hahaha
---
I had no idea! I do have a mic 
---
Its your choice to engage in PvP, don’t complain. Also FYI for everyone you can join the event and then deselect it if you want to pvp. 
---
You don't need a lot to tame, they just need to be *from* a random spawn point, not a random creature that always spawns in one spot. [Here is a map of them](http://imgur.com/a/icSh8Vu). You can only tame a creature from one of these spots.
---
This is what happens the second your warranty runs out.
---
I've been playing by myself since the beta. If you loved the exploration and combat from Fallout 4, then yes, it's totally worth it. 
---
Is Bethesda down, as I can't logon via their netpage or via client? Or am i being banned 4life? I dont know.
---
I would just like some sort of update about about the drop issue. I’m not mad about it by no means but just some sort of acknowledgement of the situation would be nice. Some of those rare masks are pretty cool looking and I’m kinda bummed I didn’t manage at least one with all the times I did the event. 
---
I love posts like this. I finally got my main character to level 40 and am bored of the grind to 50, so I’m just roaming the wastes helping all the low levels I stumble across. The Fasnacht event is super fun and an easy way to gather all the low levels to help. I hope when you’re a high level, you repay the favors and continue the cycle of kindness I’ve learned to love in this game. 
---
Thanks for the advice and information, by any chance did you get a beret form the event?
---
Officer and Paladin have red orange secondary coloring whereas the rest of the sets have white, but yeah most of the difference is the rank insignia (or lack thereof, in the case of Officer).
---
It appears in random encounter locations. I came across it just outside watoga, to the west.
---
I do this. Im a raider. If i reject the event... I can still attack people!!
---
Who wants a stupid mask.. Ill taks 1k caps for farming players at the silly event.
---
You can add me, IGN JanynFletcher. I am on almost every night and weekends too. Would love to have some regulars to play in game with!
---
That sounds pretty solid and something to try out, thanks!
---
We're aware of the issue and looking into it. Thanks for the reports on this! Will update you as soon as I have more info to share.
---
PC
---
Yeah, that's my main complaint with the backstory.  If we were the vault that was supposed to rebuild, we'd be rebuilding.
---
Some scouts sent out to figure out what's going on, pick a place to build a town, and all stick together as we rebuild society.  You're not going to rebuild a country as lone wanderers.
---
We will still pop into adventure mode to grab caps from workshop owners and event scrubs
---
Hey all, thanks for the reports. We're investigating this now, and I'll let you know as soon as I have more info.
---
If anyone wants some ammo, mods or just hang out, Im on Xbox - Tavvy Jay. Only downside is I don’t play at set hours/days, just more when I can, but usually in the evening in EST 
---
Smash them...
---
I wonder where you get your number 90% ? i do servers hop many time and many time i see same ppl and they all want the rare mask when i trade no one need plans and i have all of them for trade
---
"RIP AND TEAR!"
---
Wait, different Bethesda game. Still going to use it. 
---
You can deselect the event and PvP if desired. Those players would be white instead of yellow. 
---
That's very kind of you, but I'll get there eventually! I don't ever seem to have many screws - probably because I use every last one I get to craft those damn handmades in the hope of learning the suppressor mod! :D
---
In all honesty, explosive weapons need a nerf. They take all the fun out of the game.
---
I've got a "Login Failed. This account lacks the required entitlements. [4:8:2006]"
---
Not sure I'd want them to be tied *solely* to PvP in 76 but it was cool how that worked back in the day in WoW (didn't those titles come back after Cataclysm anyway?)
---
I was also hoping for some sort of rank progression with the Enclave, not just "Private, then General".
---
Do you stash other legendary items? What I'd do is, remove all legendary items from the stash, relog, place only the weightless and chameleon stuff there and relog again.
---
You'd be surprised. Ask whoever you're playing with if they want to read the story. One of my other buddies, a medic from Alabama, he surprised me when he asked if we could slow down and read the stuff. Don't be afraid to ask. If your friend is still playing Fallout 76 this late into it, they probably read the stuff when playing solo anyway. 
---
you are still a good person for doing it regardless!
---
[Try this](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fo76+reddit+is+the+game+worth+buying+yet)
---
You've never done an event before? Because if you have then you just called yourself a scrub
---
That's the definition of rare.
---
That's weird. I've had some luck with them spawning at the satellite arrays too.
---
no, you said exactly " *"I'm not saying those things don't happen...I'm just saying they don't happen as frequently as posts might lead you to believe"*
---
Darn. All the cool builds are on PC or PS4
---
You know da way. 
---
I just vats crit them... Not that hard to kill sentinals.
---
Yeah two types, you either get drinks and recipes as rewards or just a drink. For one my characters I get two quests at the same time, pretty sure it is a glitch, but he sends me on two different quests. But it's pretty much greek letters, a drink which you should keep for next time and it makes it easier to complete the quest and/or a recipe you can trade or a learned recipe at the beginning of the quest.
---
Without seeing the underlying math on 'chance to get certain items' here's the only thing known for certain. 
---
 Loot 1 Data and turn in = 25 caps and 350 xp.  Loot 2 (even though it only shows 1 in your inventory) it's 40 caps and 400 xp.  Loot 3...same as 2.  I've tested up to looting 5 TD and the caps and xp don't change.  If you loot more than 1 and then log out, it resets your count back to 1 because the turn in is 25/350.
---
The thing is it is just a time waster going to all the venders to sell stuff. I’ll spend maybe 3 hours in the evening playing and about 30 min of that might be game stuff. The rest being waiting, server hoping to get all of us on one server. Selling and organizing. 
---
I know what the word rare means.
---
...Theresa May? Here? This explains so much.
---
Even after double checking my user and resetting my password while chicken pecking in the new one still unable to login through the launcher AND the website.
---
Im #6!
---
And #2!!
---
As far as I can tell the quest doesn't change until you complete it. My friend had his for at least 4 days, they should change. Why can't you guys craft nuke cola dark ?
---
&gt; Uh oh! We're not able to connect to our severs to verify your Bethesda.net credentials
---
I'm on PS4 , obviously no mods available. Can confirm last patch removed about 80 pounds of junk from my stash, black titanium, screws , springs , circuits , gold. Seemed like it only hit valuable stuff, several of my teammates had the same issue. One friend logged in to find his main weapon gone. It was a one star level 40 gatling gun. Another friend had the worst luck tho. Over the past week , each time he has logged in , more of his inventory has disappeared. He decided to quit playing yesterday, the dude loved this game , but one week of losing everything he has was literally game breaking.
---
exactly. it sucks that everyone uses that or all rise. they need to make weapons more leved in power. 
---
Or just make attacks on a wanted person not PVP their entire group.  Then the teammates couldn't attack.
---
Don't. You won't like it.
---
Everyone is mean, they kill you constantly right outside of the vualt until you cry, and then they loot all of your hard earned caps you've made in two levels. 
---
Then, they jump around you in their super-powered, indestructable power armors, all while laughing at how you look like a noob in your nooby vault pajamas.
---
If you survive that, prepare to be forcibly molested by gangs of scorched beasts before you can even pick up a pipe rifle. Seriously, your character will be walking funny for the rest of the 5 minutes you can stand to play this awful game.
---
Haha noob, you won't survive 15 minutes!
---
It affects some but not others.  Many users are still able to post on Bethesda forum.
---
Now see there is exactly why I play. Nice people like you. 
---
Yeah it really shucks when the corn gets creamed.
---
My buddy uses X01 with 2x Calibrated shocks. Does pretty good with perks for hauling. He loots mkre than i do and never uses excavator.
---
Ultracite... man thats just too expensive to fix lol. Its the principle, not the mats.
---
/u/Valseek, I'm getting signed out of the Bethesda Launcher at random, getting a Lacking Entitlements error code if I try running from the EXE, and before that was getting disconnected instantly every time I tried connecting to a server. The launcher also wanted me to agree to the ToS again.
---
Cause they are a bit corny and want to be noticed by you 
---
Same. Only been playing for 3 weeks ish, level 29. I can’t wait to play when I’m at work, and when I’m at home, every opportunity I like to squeeze some game time in. I’m addicted.
---
You could have choices if you would have server persistency. This game needs communnity tools. An example of how interactions within the game unfolded recently in my national f76 group. One guy tried to sell marine armor helmet v2 (the legit one). Moderator of that forum banned him for that, and refused to accept that the player did nothing wrong and proofs for that. The banned player took his friends, said the mod he's piece of shit, and bombed their camp. The mod seemed to be piece of shit indeed, but now as the ban is justified (guys crossed the line of good taste when insulting your opponent, I mean 'yo momma so fat she falls form bed from both sides' is ridiculous and not offensive, but 'I hope you die you worthless piece of shit' is where I'm okay with banhammer). As a result, there's now one group of people that will try to screw the other group, that will remember the insults, and that will not be able to coexist. This is a negative example, but its an example of division within the community, and we need some of it to make this game Fallouty.
---
Nothing so ambitious, but I have walked stretches of the highway, or challenged myself to not fast travel for a while. You do get more random encounters that way! 
---
1. That's me, but I play solo. If I'm on, I'm farming something. Nuke white springs and clear / reload it for 2 hours until the nuke goes away. I don't go to low level areas though, unless I'm dropping off free stuff. I just farm Whitesprings and SBQ.
---
2. Never met someone like that. Maybe they're intimidated by my level? IDK. Most people wave and then move on. Finding someone with a mic is rare.
---
3. I've never had anyone say anything about my camp other than thanking me for having all the workbenches and letting them use it. In 350+ hours. I mean, it's a 2x2 box with a bed and every crafting bench though, so... you know, not exactly fancy.
---
4. LOL now this is actually 100% me. I have 10 industrial water purifiers, a 2x2 shack floating in the air, and like 100 razorgrain and a few other types of crops. I mass produce Ballistic Bock / High Voltage Hefe so it's needed, and I use lots of purified water as I run a bloodied build and use diluted stimpacks / diluted radaway exclusively. That said, my camp is waaaay out of the way and you'll probably never run into it.
---
5. I do lock my stuff, but that's because I've had mobs come in and kill my sleeping alt (I run 2 accounts, one mule, one main, useful for resetting mobs at whitesprings after nuke for farming, transfering items, etc.). Also had random players punch my alt to death, or try to. At least this way they ahve to get a bounty to do so and I can fast travel and one shot them on my main.
---
6. This one is... eh, pretty rare. I've been in like 2 pvp fights in 2 weeks. One guy got mad because I was killing all the bloated ghouls in whitesprings. In all fairness though, me relogging is the reason they respawned over and over. So he shot at me and I shot back. Another guy was attacking my sleeping alt. We traded a few kills, but being level 300 meant I had to get 3 kills for every one of his, and as soon as he started losing (thank you bloody explosive harpoon gun) he called a sniper friend in. And that's when I waved goodbye and left the server. Not really a huge deal.  
---
I'm curious if people who have these issues are mostly console, because I just don't see them on PC.
---
I'd be happy if there was only one rare mask at 0.03% or whatever it is. But there's like 4 or so that are almost impossible to get. 
---
Yeah you got both the recipe and a drink, it will vary, the quests are slightly different each time. The point is to learn as many recipes as possible, so not a loss.
---
Farming players at the parade event is an example.
---
Scrubs are the ones im farming when i reject the event and bait PvP.
---
I just wish it stayed turned off when I turn it off and leave my camp.
---
I don't think i will get one shotted. 726 dr, dody perk and lone wanderer. If someone can one shot me through that i will rethink my life choices.
---
Sorry the vampire is 2 star 
---
If you can get it cheap then yeah. Its definitely not a $60 game yet imo. But honestly I think it will get there and with the new player vending coming soon the game will have a nice community feel that it has been lacking
---
I’m surprised by how much I need steel at a high level. Has to be one of the easiest materials to come across yet it’s one of the things I seem to be short on most often. 
---
Please, don’t do this.
---
Anything that causes stagger will break sentinel. Pain train, breaking a limb, etc.
---
The dog armor is leftover from Fallout 4. 
---
This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever read you obviously had one bad experience no need to go full force and shit on the game 
---
Sounds like they suddenly have a a host of issues.
---
Do you though
---
Oh allow trading, but the caps go to the bounty first.
---
At the DMV right now, at least in the game you don't have to wait 5 hours
---
Last night there was this guy how was trigger happy and wanted. He would fire at anything with explosive automatic rounds. And just being kinda of annoying. He also had two workshops, 
---
Poseidon and the junkyard next to it. 
---
Apparently you can launch a nuke that hits both workshops. 
---
I like this idea
---
I tend to get just a single beverage.  I've received Greek Letters 2-3 times and yesterday got the Oak Holler Lager recipe...which I already knew from a previous quest when I had to craft it.
---
Oh, I do hope the anti-griefing elements ran the jerks off! I've had to server hop several times because some rando would come along and just decide I looked like a good mark. The other day I actually had a guy wait for me to finish with a vendor before chasing me down to smack on me. Too bad for that guy, I have the marsupial mutation and a chameleon armor piece. He couldn't jump on top of the train station after me and couldn't find me to shoot me after I popped over the edge of the roof and stealthed. I'll never understand the thought process of players like that. If you like PvP so much, go back to CoD.
---
It's so much more enjoyable to me to drop helpful items for the random people I come across and pay forward the kindness I've received in the past from other awesome players. 
---
My camp is near the parade and has been for months. It’s still a short walk and shouldn’t affect anything yet people still fuck with it 
---
What? You can do underwater entrances? How?
---
Can I get a Rusty Trombone, light on the sauce?
---
Damage boost, also more damaged to scorched enemies
---
Same here...
---
What issues were you having? Most of the overly frustrating problems have been fixed, and server stability is much better.
---
if you would have asked me 2-3 weeks a go, i would have said yes, they seemed to have the server disconnects fixed,
---
but it seems with the last patch the servers are shit again
---
my team got disconnected 5 times yesterday, i just finally gave up trying
---
😐
---
It also kills you sense of humor.
---
You've been warned!
---
It appears to be back up as of 10:58mst (in case anyone reads this far)
---
I just got Royal Jelly and Hive Paper from one of those giant bee things this weekend. first time i think i've see either of those.  was this part of the update?   
---
Sorry that's only served at one of those raider bars.
---
Traditional fallout games have lots of bugs. But you can get around them by console  command or fan-made patches. This time all bugs rely on Bethesda, while this company's bug producing capability is much greater than fixing. You still can enjoy it if you just want to explore and grind. But endgame contents may depress you. Nuke silo bugs, SBQ bugs.. all are very annoying.
---
Man ever since they buffed headlamp brightness, it's ridiculous inside. Worthless outside still, but inside... it's so bright I can't see what I'm looking at.
---
97% of that link is if the game is worth "buying". If you read the post, I have already bought, played, and put it down due to so many bugs..  If you would like to comment something productive and not troll, it would be appreciated. 
---
The game takes so long to let you move after loading in, it was impossible to access the favorites wheel, let alone the pip boy.  Result:  Instant death every time I loaded.  Those idiots owe me a shit ton of aluminum!
---
i was **a-maized** how all the attacks on my corn made me a **husk** of my former self
---
Green lasers! And more damage!
---
Already bought it when it first came out. Just wondering if it has improved to the point of playing it again.

Outside looks great. Inside needs more Moth.

You people are evil. This is a serious matter!
---
I'm getting this one.    "Login Failed. This account lacks the required entitlements. \[4:8:2006\]" on my PC. 
---
Yep and many others. Like having to server  hop to get cap stashes. They only get them every 24 hours now not unlimited likw before. Why are they not making the stashes spawn every time. 
---
If you nuke Dyer chemical itself you convert the pods to thing that give you violet flux, you have to nuke somewhere else
---
Yeah I don’t have friends so I have to find a container to do it myself, write down a bunch of people in the world, and hope for the best. 
---
Yeah, the game and site are not working for me.
---
Follow the main questline / overseers holotape quest. Explore every location you see along the way. Try out different weapons. Try out power armor / different armor types. Learn what workshops give you which resources (spoiler, none of them are particularly worth it except for the free fast travel point).

End game is all about nuking prime fissure site and killing SBQ for loot / plans, and acquiring better gear / more crafting perks.
---
just farm legendarys and you will get it over time, you are going to be spending most of your game time just farming legendarys anyway
---
I've figured it out:  in survival mode the rare masks give you ludicrous player damage bonuses when worn but are dropped and lootable when you are killed.
---
I'm joking but that would be hilarious if it were the case. 
---
Same issues as everyone for the first month of the game. Quests not working properly, server instability, freezing at random times when using power armor, enemies glitching constantly, etc. 
---
Glad to hear it has at least improved. I received an email about the DLC and it made me want to try it again. 
---
I'm having issues just logging into bethesda.net at all with my account. I was just playing like 20 minutes ago.
---
That I think is a great idea!  Make it so next time we earn "credits" as well.  I'd be fine sticking with a 0.03% chance to get a drop if we get enough credits.  Then go turn them in to the Parade Master who will have the rare masks available for purchase.  Obviously, it would have to take a lot of credits but at least this way it would justify an extremely low drop rate.  
---
Okay cool, definitely the exploration- What’s the pvp like? 
---
That depends. I only use PA(the ultracite one from the BoS) and have no other armor at all, just a mechanic outfit and welding googles. Out of PA even three lv1 scorched attacking me from behind could have the time to kill me.  
---
And my only weapon is a switchblade.
---
/7. Gatekeeping losers.
---
Leave them cloth and bone shards.  
---
Lessons best learned early.
---
Same issue here: I have the -50% hunger penalty even with  class Freak 3
---
Cool!
---
Humans Being Bros
---
Ahh that’s disappointing, are you console or pc?? 
---
If you are on PC please team up against me because I will make you both reconsider these choices.
---
And seriously, there is no such thing and unkillable build and there is a paper for every rock and rock for every scissors in this game.
---
There is something [going on](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1204454237):  
---
* `Exterminator's`: My main weapon is an *Exterminator's Handmade*
---
* `Nocturnal`: I never keep these, but could be related to the time of day of the loot drop, which I currently don't record.
---
* `Hunter's`: No idea, I haven't stashed these so far and the enemy type is diverse (robot, ghoul, super mutant).
---
* `Assassin's`: I have an *Assassin's Pickaxe* in my stash and an *Assassin's Leather* 
---
* `Mutant slayer's`: started stashing these weapons lately hoping for a *MS Handmade*.
---
* `Ghoul slayer's`: started stashing these weapons lately hoping for a *GS Handmade*.
---
* `Zealot's`: My secondary weapon is a *Zealot's Handmade* lvl 35. I started stashing these in the hopes that I get a lvl 45 *Z Handmade* replacement.
---
* `Vanguard's`: I used to stash an armor piece with it, but no longer, drops considerably rarer since then
---
* `Troubleshooter's`: started stashing these weapons lately hoping for a *Tr Handmade*.
---
* `Cloaking`: not sure, sometimes loot stays longer in my inventory around Whitesprings, but I don't keep these
---
* `Weightless`: I have 4 in my inventory but not in my stash.
---
* rest: probably due to the default distribution, I don't care much for these.
---
Honestly, I find I'm using my handmade less and less. Most things die by the LE before they get in range for me to switch. I mostly use it sometimes to save .45 ammo on trash mobs.
---
The only issue withe the LE is the lack of armor piercing, but it still outdamages the sniper/hunters.
---
The entitled lazy people, who just like in real life, don't want to put in any effort at all, they do nothing but ask and beg , and do nothing to contribute. They are a plague. Log in and immediately start asking everyone for everything, refuse to pick up and scrap any junk, because " it's boring" . 
---
i side spec into shotguns with my rifle character and it works great, bloodied pump action  destroys anything that gets close
---
Wait till tomorrow. New game mode comes out.
---
On the PC can't get in and when I was able to, I was getting server disconnects and the Atomic shop was acting goofy.
---
I know this isn't a solution, and I want a shared stash just as badly as you all, however, just a note that you CAN run 2x Fallout 76 on one PC. You need two accounts, and you need to use the exe file in the FO76 folder to run the game (not the Bethnet launcher). It will prompt you for a login. Open, log in on one account, open again, log in on 2nd account. AFAIK this is not against ToS or anything like that. Those of us that are serious about playing do this and have dedicated mule characters with full 20% weight reduction gear.
---
I am not saying this is a solution. It's a stopgap.
---
ps4, but ive read its bad across all systems now
---
if you can stand the disconnects, it really is a fun game, particularly if you enjoyed fallout 3 and 4
---
its just frustrating losing progress over and over due to the servers
---
That must've been it. The only thing abnormal was the dead brahmin, everything else was as it should be.
---
If u have low health and build your luck with unyielding you can boost luck and charisma for legendary looting
---
Stealth Patch
---
Oh yeah, all those things have gotten a lot better. You'll still get the occasional glitched enemy, but not a lot. Game doesn't lock up anymore, and I haven't had a disconnect in ages now. Also there's been multiple quality of life improvements.
---
&gt;I don't have friends
---
*oof*
---
Stealth Patch gone wrong.
---
I am active on a trade discord and you sometimes see them get to 400 caps but that’s high. 300 is about the most common probably but 250 is common. 
---
Plus there are plenty of people who will make them for you for free if you bring the required materials. 
---
Once you get the plans you can craft then and it’s a competitive market. If you just compare it to how much you’d have to pay the enclave vendor then your price isn’t that bad, but taking everything else into account you won’t get any bites. 
---
its how i like my brahmin steaks cooked
---
That one is reasonably easy if you have marsupial. ANd you can place a camp there.
---
I'm absolutely loving the Fasnacht event because beeswax breaks down into 2 acid and I've been collecting all I can. I can probably smelt lead ore for the next year now.
---
Stealth Patch gone wrong
---
They do happen out in the wild sometimes, but yeah, it's usually in the more populated areas. That's probably just by virtue of running into people more often in those places; with the relatively low player cap per server, paired with the large map, you're only gonna run into people so often while you're out of the "hot spots".
---
Once was in a somewhat common area, the Morgantown Airport, three guys trying to punch me to death. Had to server hop cause they were making a dent in my health through the slap damage, but that was quite a while ago. Maybe during the beta, or just after release - slap damage may have been adjusted since then, I can't remember. More recently (just a couple days ago) it happened in Flatwoods, couple of *big tough dudes* trying to harass a level 8 character, as well as another incident with a couple lads at the Whitespring using my level 111 like a punching bag. Think they were trying to bait me into going after their bounties. In both of those situations I could pretty much just ignore them, they *eventually* got bored cause I wasn't paying them any attention but boy howdy did it take a while. I give them credit for their dedication.
---
A fun one was at Mama Dolce's after a "Feed the People" event on my level 111. Some guy *clearly* running some sort of Berserker / Bloodied build (naked, next to no health, unarmed weapon) kept punching at me, trying to get me to fight him. So I ran up to the roof of the Mama Dolce's, and he followed me, punching all the while. I jumped off the building and took a pretty good chunk of my health out, and he came right down after me, but since his health was so low he just died on impact. That one wasn't "griefing" cause I had a good laugh, just figured it was relevant enough that I could tell the story.
---
Aside from directly attacking me there has been one incident where a group of three players followed me to my camp and started taking it apart. Again, pretty simple to just hop servers and be done with it, but it's frustrating that I should even have to do that to save my camp from total destruction.
---
All in all it's gonna be nice to have a separate space where the more PvP-oriented people can work out their itch to kill players, and at the same time have further protections in Adventure mode to make this sort of thing an afterthought.
---
Might be delay atomic shop broken on ps4 right now 
---
So you're willingly participating in pvp and bitching about getting killed. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
---
Okay thanks for the info, I’m ps4 too, I might wait it out then until a few more updates and keep my eye on the subreddit.  
---
TIL what TIL means too.  
---
Can't say I've had much of a good experience with people. Most of the time getting my camp destroyed or chased down by random high level players... even a couple times I've done events with other random players in the area, then after the event was over they killed me. So I'd say your experience was top notch! Thanks for sharing!!
---
I wonder how many Nukashines a player could drink? Sounds like a challenge! lol
---
I'm not buying this game twice to use a more complicated solution than just doing it on my one account.
---
It's not fixed yet.  I can't sign into the bethesda.net page nor into FO76.  FO76 gives me the "Login Failed. This account lacks the required entitlements. [4:8:2006]" error.  I attempted resetting my password just in case but it is still down.
---
Are your servers getting hit this hard and crapping out over giving away TES3: Morrowind?  Also, any chance of extending that offer if we can't sign in within a reasonably timely manner?
---
i drop my unwanted ammo in suitcases at train stations. somebody who wants it might find it!
---
Sit and play banjo throughout event
---
I am away from PC so decided to claim free Morrowind and f76 from my phone...cannot login despite doing a password reset...I hope I don't change my mind on buying f76 in interim....arrrgghh.
---
March 26th is the last day of the event, as to how valuable it is, definitely very especially to the right buyer/collector. Probably even the common masks and plans will spike up in value a couple of months.
---
If you do find a seller of one of the rarer ones, you're looking at 10-15k+ caps (maybe greater) or just an item only trade in exchange for OP gear. Could be wrong, though.
---
Fuel, how much and how much u want
---
Now can't even log into the Beth launcher.  It worked a hour ago, but FO didn't.  Now, nothing.
---
I love your build!
---
Im melee cavaliers and you guys are always a suprise! I usually get downed once (my swing kills you but i get downed) then revived by a teamate.... Or a slow death on my knees
---
Then i just run around you in circles &amp; let my sniper buddies take you out. 
---
Either way that build is a fun enemy. Im always like wtf was that? Oh yeah plates!
---
What's funny is most of those guys are just guys starting new characters and already have a lvl 100+ character in the game
---
I feel like there should at the very least be some holotapes and journals explaining how the stations are still running after everyone died.
---
You have a point there. I did state that part as fact rather than opinion.  I suppose I should have stated, "in my experience, they don't happen as frequently as posts might lead you to believe".
---
Fair enough, I'm not saying you should, I'm just saying this is the only current option. And it's a lot easier to log into both accounts, drop crap on the floor, alt-tab to second account, and pick stuff up. This only applies to PC players.
---
That would be sick. Imagine if there was like a box that could be placed underground, and you could have like a secret bunker with that. 
---
You build over water and have walls touch the water with a staircase underneath.
---
Never did it, but seen it 2xs north of Solomon's pond.  Cool idea, whoever thought of it!  Take a bow!
---
Not sure. Maybe. Probably because of me being a horder.
---
Definitely, I recently picked it up on sale and have had no issues or regrets. 👍
---
U can try to get them next year. This event is seasonal, like many more events, where rare items gonna distributed like some candys
---
Same thing on Xbox. Cleared cache and was able to play again.
---
Somebody in PC definitely had one, legally obtained or not. Who knows
---
That think is super cool too. They should add that as a reward for the wasted on nukashine quest. Or you could find it in the room that it's in. 
---
Totally agree!!   
---
Yes they do, explosive perk doesn't affect heavy gunner perks.
---
If it did, explosive would be the worst legendary you could roll.
---
I love the fact that community shortcut for assassin is obviously ass. The game seems unbalanced to people playing alone and PvE, but for team encounters of decently geared people its actually pretty nicely thought. Sentinel is considered the meta, but its not an all-purpose tool, and it needs to be supplemented by teammates that can cover the ground while under fire.
---
As it is now game has no incentives for ganging up. The truth is that for it to be a proper wasteland experience, there should be three choices. Either you are the most badass guy out there and you can run alone, or you are part of gang and you run in group, or you are walking loot bag. I suspect we will see big increase in ganging up once survival servers hit the ground.
---
Doesn't end tomorrow? 
---
But nobody got one... the event just didnt drop them at all.
---
Most people just exit the trade if they don't like the offering. I did not even realize there was a decline option.
---
and sorry if i seemed stand offish, i guess im salty due to external issues, so sorry
---
my families house i grew up in got destroyed due to the flooding of the midwest, ive been a mess all weekend since i cant get to them as the roads are all closed
---
anyway, dont let my bad mood ruin your day
---
Ammo, LOL.  I now have 3 different favorite guns to spread the ammo consuption around.
---
10000000000k caps
---
I like this change. It's a smart subversion of the skinner box system a lot of games have.
---
Why not just play it again and find out?
---
Lots of people here enjoy it, though there are still some bugs and balancing that need to be worked out.
---
That could be cool. You could make like a club with that. 
---
That sounds like a lot of fun! One of my greatest joys in this game is exploring, and following the highway sounds like a great way to see things I might've missed.
---
I go here every session and collect a few, but still just stimpacks and ammo for reward. I’m gonna try again today and report back what I get 
---
is this the prime stuff?
---
So 1 out of every player got 1 of the 5 rare masks? That's still ludicrous.
---
100%. I already have a locked brewing room in my camp. I would totally decorate it a ton of I could have this door. 
---
Today is the last day
---
Seems like people have been having issues all day. I wonder if it's too much to ask that there's an extension on the Fasnacht event due to the server downtime? I'm sure a lot of people were unable to play until later in the week so this must be taking a pretty big chunk out of the time they had to try the event.
---
Maybe so.  Most (but definitely not all) of my interactions with other players have been positive. 
---
Yeah, it's what i read. But also, thoses ghoul never spawn unless someone of lower level get there first...
---
What makes you think bottomfeeders like that would stand a chance against proper consensual PVPers? They'll get farmed like crazy against anyone actually prepared for PVP, and probably come back to the PVE servers to farm unexpecting workshop holders because that's the limit of their skill.
---
10 Billion XD main most I could get is 250K if I make out both of my accounts XD Maybe my Quad Explosive Harpoon gun?! XD
---
what is the rare mask
---
I am curious to know if this was an intended design or if it was a bug with the % calculations.
---
Tomorrow is the last day, don't know what time they're going to end it though.
---
FUCKING KILL !!!!
---
My favorite as well 😁
---
Special checks in a game with linear quests are pointless.
---
Going rate will probably be 500 usd 
---
That would be nice. It could maybe give them an effect like the vintage alcohol. 
---
It would be nice if stuff like ammo boxes could be marked to only show the ammo tab
---
The condition to my statement was that the mask had to come from a legitimate source. By failing to provide such a source you wasted both of our times and failed to support your point. Good job. 
---
Scorched rad roaches lol 
---
There are 5. Jester, demon, oldman winter, sun, and skull
---
Watch them be in the atom shop next week 
---
Try dropping it and reclaiming it by getting in after? 
---
Possibly. Checked out the atomic shop and it was selling things i already owned. Server disconnect after that. Cleared cache and was back in.
---
One of the guys who actually has one of the masks said that he turned down an offer for $500 so I doubt that any amount of caps is even a conceivable option. 
---
Thanks! I really want the Death one (or Goblin tbh) though my odds of people posting they have one with a buyout I can afford will probably be as rare as finding one myself XD
---
The Royal Jelly has been around since launch. As for the Hive Paper, I’m unsure. Fasnacht has been about the only “reliable” place I’ve been able to consistently kill and loot honey beasts. If I had to guess, I’d say it was from launch too.
---
Hey! Neither can I. I bought the red stove.  I put in a help with Bethesda support, however no response yet.
---
we should all create multiple burner accounts to upvote.
---
try to close and reopen. even so, after a while it will appear. dont forget to equip the emotes again 
---
0.03 % let that sink it’s not even a full digit not even half a digit 
---
Why would I want to run an event next year when I just ran 70 plus times  And never saw a single person wearing a rare mask including myself.
---
Was the biggest waste of time I have ever experienced in a game in my life.
---
I've not seen this yet.  I got like 30 legendary items this weekend.  However I'm not saying it isn't happening to you, but the issue might be more complex if it's only happening to some people.  You think maybe it's related to latency?  I join scorched Earth queen events using discord, and when I join someone in Germany (I live in US) the game runs like crap and I d/c and loot never shows up in general.  Also although I do always get legendary items off legendary creatures, they don't always show up right away, I've had to wait like 30 seconds sometimes.  Another reason I think it might be latency related 
---
The answer is the same. Should I buy fallout 76 yet? Should I redownload fallout 76? Should I discover free thought and make decisions for myself? These all have the same answer. If you search before posting, you’ll save time, energy and will be directly helping to prevent the cancer of duplicate posts :)
---
You are likely asking about buying Fallout on a Fallout subreddit. The answer is obviously going to be "Yes." 
---
Man I really want the old man winter 
---
Happened with mine too, on pc. I was just playing last night, wtf
---
happend just now ?
---
My atomic stor icon is just spinning and grey'd out...
---
HOLY $%^&amp; XD
---
About 95% of people you meet in the world (at least from my experience) are nice as heck, if you ever feel like interacting with someone, find someone on the map who's out in the middle of nowhere (Most likely at their CAMP) and go talk to em, they'll be happy to have someone stop by and admire their CAMPs!
---
But it says through March 26
---
Well remember, I have anti armor so you only have 363 armor against 1800 damage. You would need to match that damage in armor in order to cut that in half. Even if you cut my damage in half, 900 is still enough to kill most people 3 times over. You would need to stay permacrouched to survive, but I have other weapons to help combat crouched players too.
---
Tommorow they are changing how PvP works with survival mode. The slap damage Todd loved so much is gone in adventure mode, if you don't want to do PvP you can no longer be harmed. In survival mode it's open PvP. There will be leaderboards for players that live the longest, and legendary weapons will be handed out each week as rewards.
---
Regarding PvP balance, we will have to see how it plays out. Interestingly, power armor is actually bad for PvP because legendary armor effects do not function while in power armor.
---
I dunno, eh. PvP servers dropping on the 26th. I just rejoined as well becuase I got bored of the lack of content. It's mosty the same right now, with a beer brewing quest and a mask event where everyone gets to parade of there charchters and gear.   
---
I was so bored yesterday just decided to PvP 2-3 players with top weapons. Ended up losing 4000 caps but it was more fun than what I was having...  
---
Hopefully the survival mode will be intresting. I am going to start a new charchter for it so should eat up a bit a time, and being in a constant PvP enviroment will be make the game more exicting. I'm a bit worried though cause the players I fought weren't even specced in the best gear. If Survival just turns out to be a big hide and seek, with top geared players being basically unbeatable, well.... I'll probally still play Fallout 76 for a bit, but as long as I'm not bored I don't think I would leave.  
---
There's other stuff coming after the Survival Mode. Like Nucluear Winter a 3rd mode, Prestige! System, Legendary Vendors, 2 "dungeon" vaults... but to be honest this should have all been in the main game....  
---
I guess the most likely scenario is I'll play Survival as a new charchter till I get bored and move on. I won't delete 76 this time and just hop on when new stuff drops and play until I lose intrest... Still the Survival Mode sounds promising.
---
If the Atom shop is working.
---
On that topic of ammo. Anyone got shotgun shells they're willing to sell/trade? [Xbox]
---
It ends tomorrow early I'm the mourning 
---
I've wondered that myself, and I was always bummed that I never got to meet Mr. New Vegas. There's a mod that changes the music and adds a robot DJ that introduces songs but still, I'd love to have some radio-related quests or holotape lore.
---
Sure, but they still act as a military force, with military discipline.
---
And... all that "kill everyone for their tech and hoard it for ourselves" all went out the window with Bethesda taking over the franchise.
---
Now they're the happy-go-lucky "everyone can join, tech is super-neato" wasteland police force.
---
Yes. A hidden bookshelf door could be perfect for that too. It could be like the powered barn door. 
---
if a workbench is near a window, you can often craft and clip right thru the building.  remaining unwanted.  fun surprise when owner returns.
---
It's just... silly... in terms of the franchise history.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xS44ARcDtc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xS44ARcDtc)  found it !
---
I thought about trying to find hardcore pvp players to be friendly with. I can help supply them, they can provide protection for me when I'm farming. Thing is, that's the point when there are no worthwhile rewards for me on survival mode? If I got more / higher quality legendaries, or more loot, or something to make it worth my time (exp doesn't matter to me at lvl 315), then sure. But right now just doesn't seem worth my time over adventure mode. I'd like the incentive for pvp servers to be high enough to draw in people like me.
---
Back in SWTOR, there were events that were in contested areas that were required for great rewards. You had to take on a boss while also dealing with other players. My PvP guild merged with a top PvE guild, and dealing with the pvp players on the opposite faction so that our PvE force could take out the boss was extremely cool. Really brought the community together.
---
Don't matter what armor someone has on , that's a dumb way to judge. I have been nothing but good to everyone I've met , I have all pa, I mod them all for different purposes, when I'm in low level areas , like Morgan town, I'm hitting up containers with pharma pharma, so I have enough extra to give low levels. And the enemies there do not level up unless they are nuked. But judging people just because of what they are wearing is a narrow view to have.
---
Some dude just gifted me an owl mask and another an armor piece (maybe because I had the parade's back and didn't rush the sloth)
---
The crowd rocks.  Sorry you had a griefer, but that is a cool escape!    Can't wait until I score that mutation or a jet pack.
---
She made her choices.  Colonel wasn't able to. 
---
Stop trolling atomic shop broken over 1 hour on ps4 
---
Honestly, the only way to find out is to start it back up, play for a couple of days and see if whatever annoyed you first time has been fixed. Otherwise we can only guess at what made you give up. Hopefully you'll be pleased with the experience now
---
Most vendor you can lure over some enemies if people afk at a vendor. 
---
found it !  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xS44ARcDtc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xS44ARcDtc)

Have hundreds of those. Screws are way more rare.

---
You have to already know the stove plans before the red stove will be available. It's just a new skin for the existing object.
---
Was a post on here from someone saying they mined the data and the percentage on the masks was horrible indicating they put in the wrong numbers. Though it seems they couldve fixed that error in the past week. Which is telling.
---
I think the Bethesda servers went down.
---
Bump and upvoting 
---
Vendors will be prime hunting spots for solo stealthers.
---
I got the dog helmet as a drop. Still have it in my inventory but I can't do anything with it thought it would be funny to wear but it will not let me do so.
---
Crazy theory but maybe it's a "lemonade stand?"
---
The mine just east of Whitesprings is a great place to farm mutations. Sure, I have a couple I don't like, but I have several that I just adore!
---
Very cool place! I love the outdoor seating area, nice touch.
---
God I hate this aspect of melee.  
---
Get ghoulish and rad reduction like Rad Resistant or Sun Kissed. Stand near a rad source and regen all that damage. then just pop a radaway once in a while- far less than stimpacks.
---
Its not like rad sources are hard to find, either.
---
But yea, making their flight and screech AP based would force them to either fly or screech, but not both for very long.
---
Can't upvote this enough
---
TY
---
That's why I leave all of my doubles in brown bags near vault 76. I couldn't even say how many lvl 2 and 3's that I have given masks, and plans to this past week. 
---
Guys. Now that pvp is out, should I come back to the game? Please ask me to come back. My parents didn't love me.
---
why do you need to wear your pa in low lvl areas?
---
Oh okay I like the sound of that, I think I’d stick to the adventure mode for the start aha or is there two separate character saves for each mode?
---
I laughed. Then I sobbed a little.
---
No worries guys. Today it works again. *magic*
---
It's protected unfortunately. Wish you could nuke that as well. All that razorgrain / corn.
---
I just assumed it would since the heavy gunner perks say non explosive. That’s my bad.
---
Did you test with a wanted attacker? I didn’t test Unstable Isotope, but Electrically Charged wasn’t an issue until the attacker was Wanted, then it’s reactive damage initiated full PVP. 
---
My full write up on the results I got during patch 6 is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/
---
Not running after market game mods but I still lost screws and springs. The worst was the scrapped ultracite 🤦‍♂️ ~2000 rounds of .50 and 5.56 and nothing to show after killing 2.5 SB and getting DC’d
---
It is what it is.
---
Also lots of variety of junk to distribute for repair, but more importantly how or why does it effect you at all what someone else is wearing. So long as I'm not attacking you , I attack no one 
---
just looks dumb is all.
---
I was on yesterday and noticed a player with a 115 cap bounty.  I headed over and popped a critical on him, then left so he could go back and collect his bag.  A little while later, we both wound up at the parade event and I saw he had a bounty again.  A felt a little guilty when he saw me coming and popped up the *angry* emote at me but, alas, my gun seemed to raise of it's own accord.  I wandered off so he could collect his bag once the deed was done.
---
He came back to the parade throwing *angry* emotes and *thumbs down* while I happily sent *hearts*.   Then I gave him a bunch of known plans and we took a selfie in front of the burning effigy.  ♥️
---
Yay, no more dealing with their crappy launcher.
---
Tents pop up all the time - not enough to cover the whole area, but still. And it has been 25 years - not sure what would be left or if those same people would have moved into the now vacant towns.
---
3/3 points invested in the stealth perk, I forget it’s actual name. 
---
He should give you a new one they are different every day
---
can always message the vendor and see if he'll do customization.  He does "regular" bottles too that need an LED base.  I imagine you can find a rotating base somewhere and have a top made to sit on it.  I actually just placed an order for one each of the Quantum and Victory since I've been looking at them for a while.  
---
In my experience it works pretty well. Maybe they're not afk, just distracted or taking their time. You can't really tell if someone is actually afk but if you click through the vendor lines about 5-6 times you'll definitely get a reaction
---
I was just making a joke dude. I feel your pain. 
---
way to prove my point, good thing is i can block you now kiddo
---
enjoy puberty!
---
Sorry, we'll stop with all the corny humor.
---
Bloody super sledge could probably reach like 5-6K damage per hit. Melee is super overpowered.
---
Yeah I'd say play it again if you've got it. I am a level 17 and have been having a good time even though I adventure off the beaten path and get mauled by radscorpions.
---
And if you like PvP then that update is just around the corner. Personally I'll stick to adventure, but I know there is a lot of blood thirsty people out there haha
---
Hmmmm I'll check next time I'm on. If you buy it in the shop you would think it would be unlocked.
---
I've only seen it from lists of cosmetic items people found in the data files. Old posts where people were trying to find all the cosmetics in the game, and I've at least seen or heard of most of the others on the lists. But I've only ever seen one person bring attention to it. https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Grafton_Monsters_jacket_and_jeans Here's at least a page for it here. It has stats and an editor ID but no one has a picture.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ak9i4c/how_do_i_find_grafton_monsters_jacket_and_jeans/ A guy in this post said he got it, but I'm taking that with a grain of salt.
---
I feel like it's in the game, but not added yet maybe. The VTU jacket and jeans I know was only a low chance to drop in an event in the forest, but at some point bethesda added it inside VTU. Maybe it'll be something similar to that
---
Bethesda said something is wrong and they are fixing it.
---
cool
---
Thanka for the tip friendo
---
No, because I don't believe you're supposed to be doing that anyway.
---
I want bos paints. Otherwise I could care less lol
---
No worries, my friend.  Sorry to hear about your childhood home.  Is everyone in your family ok?
---
There's not a kernel of truth to this.
---
Alright. Thanks for answering :)
---
Can't, if I read the lore correctly - 76 powered down permanently as a followup to reclamation day.  So for the same reason that it can never be a player hub, it really shouldn't have operating radio stations either.  It's dead and sealed so as to force us out into the wasteland.
---
I'm sure that there is a catch. Maybe trade in all of the duplicates for a rare. I'll be boned if that's the case I have given them all away. Oh well. It's not like these wont get scrapped as soon as the stash is too full.
---
just looks dumb. does nothing to me. just look dumb
---
Summer looks pretty good too
---
I am able to login the launcher, but then get an error message when trying to load the game itself.  It was working about an hour ago when I had logged out to make a post about a different issue I noticed with my stored camp building items vanishing  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5ce2t/dude\_wheres\_my\_crap\_are\_camp\_stored\_items/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5ce2t/dude_wheres_my_crap_are_camp_stored_items/)    
---
Happy Monday I guess.
---
Uranium fever event?
---
I was thinking of getting an alt account if I see a decent sale some time, but figured I'd have to run it on a second PC.  Do you use dual monitors, or can you run the game twice in a windowed mode on one screen?
---
I built my friend an arena, and what I did was I built with metal walls surrounding the fighting area. Then I built a garage door for both people to enter and had two portapotties in each corner for the people to go into before starting. I also had many obstacles for hiding and cover and had second story floors around the walls with pews for watching the fight
---
I always pull out my explosive .50 cal and juggle the corpse for a while if someone does this. Fun times.
---
I keep mine locked.   The only thing that is in my camp.
---
Also....  Great storage area for nuke mines in case of rule breakers.
---
You sneaky bastard!  I cant reply your joke! You corned me alive! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5cutn/am_i_the_only_one_still_having_problems_getting/ejclrea/?context=1000
---
They are looking into it, I'm getting "disconnected from server" when hitting play sometimes currently, had the same issue as you earlier. Just wait and hopefully they'll fix it, seems to maybe be some network related errors as some servers works.
---
doot do do doot doot doooot dooooot do doot doot doot do doooooo
---
Filthy casual question, but relavent. Can I build a porta potty for my camp? I'm tired of going in the woods out back, or inside my power armor (there's waste recycling in those things... right?).
---
I have 20 cores all at 100%, I wouldn't want to take anything less than 1500 caps tbh.
---
Thank you bot, now create a default response for alternatives such as "play", "download", "redownload" "get back in to" etc.
---
yes they are ok thank god, my dad finally left before it got really bad, he wanted to try and stay through it all, now he's very glad he left
---
we did lose some family pets though
---
:(
---
thank you for asking
---
I literally just started playing. How and where do I go on this last day to get a thing 
---
Yeah for most of my tests I can test on an alt, I have 2 accounts. I did some testing for Zealots on a nice “neutral” scorchbeast to confirm they’re vulnerable to Zealots- as far as I’m concerned, they are. 3 shots with Zealots sniper vs 3 shots with a normal sniper rifle gave me a consistent amount of HP loss each time, and the difference was noticeable. And I was letting it regen health between shots so I could directly tell where on it’s name each shot took it’s healthbar to. Testing with things like Furious and explosive weapons is a lot trickier though
---
There is some kind of partial outage going on:
---
 [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Showing there a outage for fallout76 on Bethesda status page
---
From my testing, AA / Armor piercing perks definitely don't work on energy weapons. Can't wait for this to be fixed so I can run a bloody gatling plasma on SBQ.
---
I "fixed"  it   with   scan and  repair  , butafter  few hrs  i got  similar problem again  :   Unable to connect to servers to verify your bethesda.net credentials." 
---
Nah it's a separate thing. It's supposed to be a varsity jacket for the Grafton High school's football team if the editor ID is anything to go off of
---
Alright!  Adding now. 
---
I am also the main crafter for my whole guild, my stash and character are both always maxed on junk. I'm always ready to repair a bunch of weapons and armor for any teammates . I am always over encumbered without pa. 
---
Most important, it has no effect on you, and I don't care what anyone thinks is dumb, I'm old enough to realize others opinions don't matter that much. I save such concerns for real life shitvthat actually important 
---
Lol I can't login to the server right now but I'll get the number once I'm able to.
---
I ain't lookin to get banned!
---
True true
---
Leave some open and some locked.  That way passersby can take some, but some gets left for you.
---
Yes please! 
---
Somebody just dropped a nuke there about half an hour ago - unfortunately I was just getting ready to log out so couldn't take advantage of the situation to farm for materials.
---
I can fly. I'll fly in any area I want with my blue and purple quantum armor and you'll be stuck on the ground like the low level hater you  are.
---
Enforcer.  You seek Enforcer.
---
but are we gonna be able to transfer the ownership of the game to Steam Platform for free?
---
That’s just over estimating it’s worth. 500$ irl is worth more than anything in game and I doubt he will get more than that
---
I usually go around to low levels and tell them if they collect Bloodleaf and Soot Flower for me. I'll pay them five caps per leaf. This guy made around a thousand bucks yesterday. And I made around 2000 healing salve. 
---
Block people so you can hold yourself in your own echo chamber. Great Idea! Anyone that has opposing opinions or viewpoints should be ignored! Enjoy life buddy, it will be tough on you.
---
Kinda glad this is happening. Now, I'm forced to do stuff I was putting off by playing fallout.
---
wa-wa-wee-wah! i'd buy that for a dollar!
---
Depends on what you mean with "state"
---
If it's buggs, every patch that fixed something brought more buggs in so no difference there.
---
If it's stability, many players left so you'd expect better stability and less laags but that's really not the case.
---
The quality of the pve content? Enemies still scale with high level players (what makes the entire map a minefield for leveling players), the xp and caps were nerfed so you gotta put more effort into getting out of this hell spiral. Endgame content still doesn't exist.
---
Pvp? There's a new mode that disables the pvp locks so that's that. If you fancy beeing shot down by level 150 players, go ahead. Otherwise you won't find it in a different state to what it used to be.
---
Limited one
---
i have a 2 star mutants combat shotgun, I cant remember the second perk, i'll have to check tonight after work. What are the perks on the 3 star tesla?
---
I lock my camp because the  neighbors are wild.
---
However if you have marsupial you can get in.
---
Never heard this idea before. Brilliant.
---
Twice in windowed mode on same screen. 2nd monitor is for monitoring Discord for nuke drops =). 
---
Be forewarned, you need a good GPU to pull this off, and you may have to reduce the graphics settings. For reference, I run an i9-9900k with a 2080 ti, BUT, I also run on ultra settings at 1440p and have my FPS uncapped in FO76 and capped at 120, and I usually get 100-120 FPS except for one weird staircase in Whitesprings that kills my FPS. You can probably pull off 2x FO76 on a 1080 ti with ease if you're willing to run 1080p / 60 fps. The biggest issue I ran into was actually memory. Had to upgrade from 16 GB to 32.
---
Is it over powered for the given situation?
---
You may be old enough to realize others opinions dont matter that much, but you dont seem to be the age of putting that into effect. From your responses, it looks like my opinion matters to you greatly.
---
Well, like the propaganda posters in the game say, we're all in this together...even if we occasionally have differing opinions.  Take care.
---
I'm gonna go with: _probably_ not
---
Well stated.
---
Right now there is no in-game faction/guild support. Social features are also lacking as there is no text chat, only voice chat and emotes. The game is purposely designed to make you feel lonely, you will never see a large numbers of players as servers cap out at 24 players. You can see other players in the map though. You can also add friends whom you can fast travel to at any time.
---
Servers are semi-persistent. You don't select a server to play on and you are not stuck on one server either. When you hit play the game will put you in a random server. If you exit to the main menu and hit play again you can end up on a different server. The idea here is to seamlessly allow people to play the game without worrying about server selection. The game is also regionless, which is pretty nice.
---
I'm also a charisma player however its level 9. I basically have s and a maxed. 
---
I'm thinking taking off 2-3 points put them in L. 
---
Honestly though if you max out super duper and refined wars you actually get a lot for your effort, acid is sort of hard to come by but especially during the Fasnacht parade event if you have leftover beeswax you can scrap it for acid right now
---
I’ve had so much kindness thrown at me in the game it actually restores my faith in humans. I know it’s only a game but those people do not have to go out of their way to help others and I think it says a lot about someone when they do! I’ve had higher levels help me kill enemies when I was struggling, give me tons of stuff while at a vendor, someone has even given me outfits and neon lettering (which I only found when I logged back in) and someone even kitted out my whole camp for me &lt;3
---
Drop in the suitcase in front of watoga station vendor, it has become very popular.
---
Still can’t login now . 
---
It is a very different game than it was at launch. Granted, its still got some bugs but they're not nearly as frustrating as they were in the beginning but it doesn't feel like you're playing a BETA game. It seems that the game population is a lot higher than it was a month or two ago as well, at least on PS4. Bethesda made good progress on it and has some pretty cool stuff coming in the next few months.
---
lol, Finally they worked out text chat xD /s
---
This is actually a very fine idea. I'll will write it down to make sure to never do it this afternoon.
---
Why in the world would it be unfair for me to give my rifle character a good Rifle I picked up on my heavy guns build... You're saying it's logical you're only *supposed* to use the weapons you pick up on each character? So why is there trading? I guess *I'm not supposed to* trade huh? It's really simple. I'd like to trade item I've picked up to another character. The account that charater is on should make no difference, whether it's mine or someone elses. You're saying you're not *"supposed to be doing that anyway"* ? 
---
Ehh… you can tell which ones are new and which aren't, by seeing where they go and how they act.
---
and they will kill you for it
---
BTW, does anyone known a Fatman drop location?
---
You can break into my camp and do whatever you want, I only ask one thing: CLOSE THE F***ING DOORS!! :)
---
yeah, i mean i never keep cloaking armour but i get a lot of it drop, same with exterminators, hunters, troubleshooters etc so i'm not sure what link that has to the stash.   
---
I'm guessing by your "I've started stashing", you have yet to see any results yet?  
---
I still think it's our brains seeing patterns that aren't there. I've farmed WS for hours before and had a lot of drops but i've yet to see any real patterns in those huge numbers, other than a lot of "trash" effects!
---
Hello,  
---
It's beeing investigated.  
---
https://bethesda.net/fr/status
---
I'm just telling you what I've seen. 
---
Yea I'm having hella problems trying to get on a server an then stay in it too. Atomic shop also has a loading icon next to it. Cant access it at all
---
Somethings going on. Atomic shop wont load and when i hit play to load into a game im being immediately disconnected from the server. On ps4 here.
---
Ive never run into a lv 100 raider in another fallout game...
---
player vending will be a game and economy changer imo. It's difficult to trade w/o a mic (puppy ate it)
---
What makes you think you're banned?
---
They didn't ban you because you talked bad about the game. Also are you getting a error code that says your banned OR is the server still down and your jumping to conclusions?
---
exactly
---
same thing happening to me on xbox EU
---
If you take it, be prepared for it to be contested. Often multiple times. I used to blockade every doorway, but now I just take the doors off. It gives me more access to snipe from multiple places.
---
Don't forget to place your fast travel mat someplace out of the way, where you can't be seen when you FT in. If they take it, you can camp that spot waiting for them to FT back in as well.
---
Uranium fever 
---
Watoga hs (good exp)
---
The line that runs from watoga to ammunition  plant (wonderful exp) occasional  legendary
---
They better give out steam keys to everyone who has already fucking bought it on Beth.net.
---
Is the summer insanely rare because I’m 100% positive I saw someone with it?
---
Same.
---
Oh thank god it’s not just me 
---
ill have to check
---
Same.  Lots acting like it's battle Royale lol.  There is no shrinking boundary forcing us closer and closer to one another and just because I see a lowbie walking around does not mean I need to shoot him.  Besides, some of my best friends are made after we wooped each other's asses in some kind of PvP lol 
---
Any proof would be neat.
---
Also, servers are having some issues now, see https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
You sure ya banned and not just being affected by the current issues?
---
if you got the 4:8:2006 code you're not banned. https://bethesda.net/status
---
If you are getting the error that ends in 2006 you are not banned.
---
There is some trouble brewing:
---
 [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status) 
---
Probably thinks he was banned because the servers are broken.
---
There's a note on the red stove that says you have to already have the stovepipe plan unlocked :)
---
Spelling checks out. I'll be sad, too.
---
Nice cosplay
---
How about 100% VATS accuracy &amp; crit build that sits in bush with chameleon and dragon, waiting you to walk by?- This something I saw someone mention and if this actually works, how you counter it? 
---
derp
---
As much as I'd like to play it on Steam and not the Beth launcher, I'm not buying it again :/
---
That is pretty annoying. Also half the time the "cap collector" doesn't work either and you don't get to do the secondary search. This doesn't happen with "pharma karma"
---
I died there and then.
---
There's an issue going on. I want to try Morrowind too, hope they fix it on time or extend the giveaway.
---
HA!
---
yeah i just logged in derp. feel like an ass now.
---
I meant as a reward I got the Recipe for Nuka Dark each day.  I complete the quests every day so far.  I just hate duplicate rewards because I still have others I want to get. 
---
As for not being able to make Nuka Dark, doesn’t Bubbles in Whitespring sell it?   I would just buy one to give to Biv, pretty sure that works cause both days I got the “give Biv a drink” quest i already  had the booze in my stash since I have made sure to keep two of every booze I find.  
---
yup, looks that way :/
---
Cool :)
---
Yeah, I'm bloodied melee with unyielding/sentinel I got an bloodied/explosive shotgun just for survival mode. If I see someone in PA I know they're not getting any %decreases in damage from legendary so I pull out the shotgun, otherwise secret agent makes melee OP since it prevents vats.
---
Why don’t we have bloody mess for player corpses, so our heads can roll down slopes
---
sounds like you ran into some filthy casuals. 
---
Its broken for me on PC lol I'm serious about the ban wave thing they don't discriminate.. 
---
seriously, almost nobody stays back to get the wolves and stingwings.  i park up on the house porch roof at the end and just blast the ground when they spawn with a tesla rifle, about 3 seconds and i'm done. the one or two that go around the house the other way get mopped up pretty quickly after that.
---
I don't think you know how small 0.03% is.
---
Definitely the best one, first time I heard it I felt like one of the 'psychos' from Borderlands.
---
It's not even letting me log into [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net), says my password is wrong, then gives me an error when I try to recover my account
---
Mutation receipes can be bought in the Bunker in either the Science or Medical wing, I can't remember which one, but they are expensive
---
I like when you repair all the pipes in the first stage  but they don't register as being repaired. Sometimes the server will catch up, but other times it just fails and you have to  go back to the terminal and shutdown the reactor again. At that point there is a 50/50 shot if that will even occur.  
---
If you have a friend, when you sit down, they can close the door for you. Pooping is a team effort!!
---
Did you get an email stating that you are banned or are you just jumping to conclusions?
---
same :(
---
Check the server for 100+ lvl players, and don't launch it if Whitesprings is nuked, or the fausnacht event is active.
---
I get the same mask pretty much every time I run it. I only seem to get these 3
---
Owl Mask
---
Toothy Man Mask
---
Giant Mask
---
Honestly the fact that something like this can be done is one of the strongest allures this game has and one of the ways in which player actions can have some weight. Some might see it as grieving sure but it's not a thing you get to experience in many games.
---
Yep. Was literally running to the SBQ to grab my loot and got disconnected. The servers have been TRASH since the last update to the point I'm really not even playing anymore
---
extend the giveaway would be the best move for them.. else people will riot
---
i got this:   **this account lacks the required entitlements \[4:8:2006\]** 
---
Fallout 4 did the same thing. The USS Constitution has some stat checks in it. It's weird, why just the one time?
---
At least it goes both ways I guess. I've been farming stealth boys and I've got a little over 45 minutes of invisibility built up for this exact reason. He who hits first wins. At least until they balance combat a bit more.
---
*TankDonutsJr has died
---
What platform are you on? I have a few extra Beret’s. 
---
I'm not able to log in either and several of my friends.  This issue is NOT RESOLVED!
---
I'm able to login but the atom shop won't load.
---
.003% drop rate I think
---
Things should not vanish from the stored tab. It's a bug.
---
Xbox, though it seems there are some login issues across all platforms at the moment anyway.
---
What do you mean by regionless? As in USA and EU servers etc. exist in same place?
---
Wait it is that rare? I have that! Maybe if it's that rare I can trade it for one of those rare masks!
---
If the drops are so low, how will all the dupers all get their hands on one to dupe in the first place?
---
I’ll take “Things that didn’t happen” for $1,000, Alex. 
---
I doubt that. They don't want to fight people who can fight back. 
---
Yeah now I can go level in Destiny. 
---
only issue is getting them to realize you are actually trying to gift them stuff!  even with a mic and me telling them that, alot of them seem to run away lol
---
That can’t be right, I had 3. Lmfao I sold em to whitesprings for space in my stash hahahaha 
---
I had to wait for 3
---
Servers are banned, you're not broken!
---
Also, I'm kinda jealous of the owl mask! That's the cutest one!
---
Only briefly. Maxson changed that and reabsorbed the outcasts. 
---
BoS in Appalachia take it on a case by case basis but the mission is the same.
---
And they act way more like a militia than anything resembling an actual military. 
---
hey cloth is useful again after all the fasnacht decorating i did at my CAMP, im out of cloth!
---
pre-war money has actual value again!
---
Crops don't like moving house apparently, but they also don't seem to wind up in my stash until they've rotted.
---
Had at least 30 plants going on my little farm, and today I found 13 rotten fruit, no sign of the still fresh fruit.
---
Not so bothered by the loss, but confused as hell to where it actually ends up.
---
Outstanding!
---
I was able to connect and log in again, but there's something still wrong going on.  It takes a few minutes for PA to appear to equip.  9 out of 10 hostiles you kill disappear and don't provide a lootable corpse or meat pile.  I'm logging off until this is resolved.
---
Wow that guild stuff sounds totally awesome.
---
Well the truth is its all about the experience. For me, currently I don't have to think to dominate, and I like thinking very much.
---
There is no concerns such as in the scenario I describe below, with open PvP rules, and I want my game look like below:
---
Lets say after long battle my resources are heavily depleted. I know of one place where I will get them, but unfortunately its either walking for ages or fast travel to a point that visiting usually ends in violence. I take the dangerous path and FT to that station. The plan is as soon as it loads run like hell, get to hiding and listen. The game opens up, I give all sides a quick look then start sprinting until I broke line of sight with whatever could see me there. I stop and listen, trying to ignore grunts of nearby monsters. I hear human footsteps. I pick out my explosive bait and throw it somewhere near the monsters. I wait for them to start making noises and as soon as they do, I sprint away from the direction I heard footsteps from and the bait. There is a small hill nearby, so I circle it quickly and go there so that I'd be facing the mess I made. I pull out my silenced rifle and look around to find the source of the footstep sound dealing with the monsters. With three shots I fully load my vats crit bar on monsters, then place a devastating head on the guy. Few dozen caps magically appears in my inventory and for that I am always grateful. I continue my path towards my goal, and soon I am there. The area where I fought previously is within the range of gunfire sounds, and the area where I want to loot is occupied by gun-wielding critters. Its either do it fast and loud and attract revenge, or do it slowly, from hiding, and with silenced weapons. Knowing I'm short on aluminium, I look at the weapons condition to decide which one will last me longer, and seeing that silenced rifle barely holds up I run head-on for my desired junk and then just sprint until I can FT to my camp.
---
Yes, I could definitely farm 20 aluminium faster than in the above example by just jumping to adventure, but I will never be able to get as intense experience from this 20 aluminium if I won't be hunted or risk being hunted in the meantime.
---
Helvetia at the back corner of the bookstore spawns a pickaxe pilsner.
---
Man, im fairly sure you were not banned for voicing your opinion. 
---
I have blatantly poked at bethesda in many ways.
---
I run NukaCrypt which trivializes the end game process for launching nukes. 
---
They are not going to ban someone for voicing their opinion about the game, the backlash they would receive for that would be insane, which they definitely dont want.
---
Having disconnect issues upon log in, Atomic Shop not loading - Ps4
---
This is a great idea, but I doubt this change will be made.  This would likely eliminate the usefulness of lead extractors and other lead scrap sources.  It would also make the ammo perk less useful.
---
...if anyone wants to buy it twice that is
---
Same here but my rad resist is a lot better since I have a few trapper pieces. Im am a two hand melee medic. The gun I use in hopes to get the scorch to come down is the gatling gun since it has the highest damage output using the lightest ammo or one of them anyways. Without any damage for ranged weapons. When the fucker hits the ground its pretty much dead.
---
I just started taking them on with no pa and Im fine. If I can get 300 rad resist without PA I can share rad sponge and be fine since I rely on my mutations for extra damage.
---
I am working on changing my build around so I can use a gun or two. I think I can pull it off because the only damage I take that actually hurts is rads. My build is already weird enough but its fun for me so I guess it doesnt matter much.
---
I believe their is an inactivity timer for vendors, so either wait or try another vendor till they move on the map. I haven't really run into this as an issue so not sure how big of one it may be.
---
Yeah, it's because of the free copies of Morrison's GOTY they're giving away today. 
---
The actual reward is the recipe you got and all the friends you'll make giving them beer.
---
Ohhh bomber jacket. I was thinking of something else. 
---
I can't even log into the site, says my password is wrong, then won't let me reset
---
Annoying.
---
I see. It happened the same earlier on to me as well. I had killed the process then logged back, but it took some good 2-3 minutes to just get logged to the launcher.  
---
  Anyway, I'd suggest you wait untill the server maintenance/fixe, then if you  are still unable to log in, then send a ticket explaining everything.  
---
Make screen shots of your posts, if not already, in case they'd been deleted.  
---
But I for real know only about one 'developer' that bans people in their game from posting in different forums, and it's not bethesda. ( so I know of).  
---
This sounds really weird if real.
---
Same here and I’m on Xbox.
---
It cannot be that low. Not even remotely.
---
I remember being flooded with those in my hayday of doing Forbidden Knowledge, so much so that I was leaving them in the locker above the 'mailbox'.
---
That's awesome. I've had to deal with a lot of jerks with the game too so mostly I avoid people, but I try to help out where I can. I have the perks to re-search med kits and food/trash bins with the possibility to get more items so more often then not I'm swimming in non-perishable foods and various med supplies. 
---
With that extra supplies I go back to flatwoods and put a little stock into the cash bin there. But what I really stock there is the mail boxes and small bins there, cause when I started I looked in every bin just for the possibility to get stuffs, so I know the lower lvls are gonna be a bit more thorough with searching. And when I get a repeat recipes, ammo I don't use or if I have a weapon  I haven't sold yet those get dropped in there too. 
---
So if you don't come across anyone to help you could always do what I do just to give back a little bit when you're able to! Just gotta do what you can when you can. 
---
Create a new account.
---
For me I'm still working on healing 20 players and finding using magazines. Csnt figure out why I can't complete. 
---
It was an Atom shop mask.
---
Unless you are a mid to short range full auto rifle user who spams crouch jump with marsupial mutation, I do not fear thee.
---
I know what I do well against and what does well against me.
---
I want the game but for 60$..... oof
---
I haven't seen others wearing one, or at least don't recall it.  No idea if rare.  Wear it inside my PA.  Wasn't expecting to be called a cheater because of it.
---
I do that but that’s because I’ve been running two characters through it. So I only do stuff on one and park the other. 
---
Helvetia, I’m on mobile, otherwise I’d be more detailed.
---
the cheaters who glitched into the dev room have them, that is about it
---
so they will get rewarded for cheating... great!
---
I like to lure people into my camp then bomb them with artillery from a friends camp. 
---
Yeah I really wanna link up with folk. I LOVE the building aspect of FO4 so I imagine I can spend lots my time gathering for that :3
---
It seems fair. I mean I played Runescape 1 for hundreds of hours and I never got santa hat or halloween mask. If something is supposed to be rare, then everyone shouldn't be entitled to get one. 
---
Anyway if you are on PC I will gladly make dinmer out of people that attack you so you can get your legendary stuff in peace.
---
\+1 for T.E.N.T.  and smoke grens
---
Though, why flashbang when you can just toss a nuka grenade and see bits and pieces fly?
---
One thing I'd really like though, is modifiable ammo for M79 launcher. Smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, homing grenades (hey it's the future), mirv's, plasma/freezing/EMP not to mention flare grenades that you shoot up in the sky and come down with small parachute and lit the fuck up everything etc. -&gt; bring versatility to the table.
---
Automatic launcher could have regulars and incendiary and mirv for ultimate fiery exploding death.
---
RMT it then turn around and RMT it?
---
Yes, anybody can play with anybody else on the same platform. So all PC players can play with all PC players no matter where they are. I am in the US and I've played with people from Europe and South America and did not notice any lag.
---
You know it’s serious when atomic shop is broken. And I’m certain they’re working harder than ever to fix it.
---
Whether it actually happened or not is honestly mystery. It was that 100 juice no pulp Guy with the old man winter mask, it was on his post someone asked him how much the most he's been offered he said $500 who am I to know if that's true or not. 
---
Can't you buy that from the Atomic Shop?  (Can't confirm since it's currently down)
---
In order to that you would actually have to find somebody that has one. A needle in a haystack the size of a city.
---
Oh good lol, had me annoyed at myself for a second there haha
---
I only hope to help the public opinion fire you try to ignite for others, for myself personally, I care not, for the sake of community, I care, I'd rather not have more rampant ignorant hate than this world is already infected with. I'd like this game to thrive, and opinions like yours may effect lower level players , that could askew their views of the game as a whole. So as far as me personally, hate me if you like. But I love fallout 76
---
Ohhh
---
Well I imagine you use chameleon or stealth boy and either sneak away or sneak up behind them.  I mean in any game with guns, if you're just walking around in the open you're vulnerable.  
---
Now if you're just hell bent on sprinting around in the open I'd say your best bet is cavalier (15% damage reduction while sprinting per piece) assassins (8% damage reduction from players) appropriate DR perks from agility (maybe dodgy but it drains AP so you can't Sprint), chems for more damage reduction (or whatever).  It's hard to game this situation without more details but that's a general start.   
---
Could just stealth boy mod some power armour and get around that way too.  I've been picking up stealth boys all week in preparation for survival myself (not using PA)
---
You are correct 
---
I don't think it's exclusive to low lvls, but Agreed! the other night some jackass had his "shop" set up right there, and wouldn't stfu on area chat about his awesome sales. 
---
Yea! This is the post apacalypse, not the bloody Ritz Carlton. You want a working sewer system for your golden buttholes, you best rebuild society first.
---
I thought I was insane
---
I will check in ten mins
---
Yes!  Was grinding for that mask and plans.  Soldier is fun, and others are occassionally something to wear.  But owl rocks!
---
Aesthetics?
---
You can freely choose the mode you want to play in, no need to make a new character.
---
Thank you for admitting the mistake rather than blaiming Bethesda for misinterpretting the error code.
---
SBQ drop for item you need is 0.0000001%...compared to that, 0.03% is nothing.
---
Theyre a 1/3333 deop chance it seems
---
I love how they say it’s a partial outage but everyone I know can’t get into the game...
---
The one in game has the orange BOS underarmor, I have that and kept it as I collect BOS items and do a ~~insane~~ normal amount of tech data turn in.
---
Not just you, it's basically everyone... I've personally completed 130+ events and attained nothing rare.
---
At least I learned that Helvetia's surroundings are a good place to farm flux for lower level players. Cranberry bog is a bit too stressful for me and Whitesprings seems to get nuked way less now.
---
Also Bethesda will expect Nukes in the next limited time event, so maybe we'll get bonus nuke content then. Honestly it was foolish of them not to expect them now.
---
Haha I’ve had this happen a few times. I’m like okaaay, your lose! 
---
I do, fairly well. Would be really fun if everyone ran around with the rare masks like they did with duped weapons/armors?
---
you can drop them in my pocket!  im on ps4, id be happy to relieve you of the burden of those cumbersome items
---
I know what I'm doing tonight! lol
---
Sbq is always there not marketed as a one week event 
---
Fell through the world with the mods installed and could never pick up my dropped bag o' loot afterwards (it was located underneath the world surface and unattainable - I waited about an hour in the hope that it might appear above like legendary meat piles do, but no luck).
---
I swear t o god I just saw post like this 2 days ago
---
Yep I believe the devs explained it last patch or so, because it didn't quite make sense
---
Not that tse. Tech data reward drop
---
Time to go make a sandwich. While still in trader menu.
---
Huh that's interesting. I've played that event as much as I could server hop hoping I could get the demon mask or any I didn't have but no luck. thanks for that though I'll play it more I guess
---
I love to help people with my camp stuff but i hate when they don't shut the door lol
---
I got the camp near Watoga in the place where there are the junk extractor and the tunnel, i use the half destroyed building there to leave stuff for others since it got 3 boxes, i labeled them "Loot" and put a light inside.
---
Thank you for the teachable moment lol. I'm new to Fallout and had noticed the colors change, not knowing what it was. 
---
people talk about toxicity in online games but i have yet to find one person like that. everyone is very nice. 
---
I noticed a while ago I was losing mutation abilities (with starched genes) I purged them all and got them again.
---
I immediately noticed a bunch of differences in how motions worked. I could jump higher/ hang longer and reloading became super fast.
---
I have 4, they arent that rare
---
7: When randoms want all your plans 😁
---
XD true true, just was not even aware the Bomber Jacket was rare XD
---
PC I can't login either. Very frustrating...
---
That's the Vault-Tec Bomber Jacket.
---
Not sure what the one in game looks like.
---
What is with that anyway? They request but then don’t seem to offer or ask for anything and no other communication 
---
I've seen someowhere the drop rate is about 0.03 %.  
---
This is a friggin joke.  
---
All that for a dumb carnival mask, no thanks.
---
why did you let them see you coming?
---
I don't know if Bethesda didn't make these masks attainable but I have absolutely never seen anyone with these masks.
---
I started crafting and scrapping both at first. Just seemed like a waste of resources for me because I'm always farming weapons and legendaries. I've been pretty lucky getting lever action and handmade drops for scrapping.
---
the fuck are you on about? was just a light harted top 6 list. 
---
I was getting something similar on PC. I tried about a dozen times before I could login. Atomic Store was still offline.
---
All of these are great ideas. Modifiable ammo is a need.
---
I was really caught off guard by how cool and nice people are in this game. A few days ago I had a guy lend me a suit of power armor so I could come along for a blast zone to level up. 
---
Sounds fun.
---
Is just you.
---
Everyone else got theirs, as a matter of fact I am wearing the demon one right now and I am standing next to no less than three old man winters.
---
I am not surprised that you didn't realise, there have been no mention of the subject since the event started.
---
But yeah, they are fairly common so is definitely just you; maybe next year hey?
---
I would let you borrow some of mine but... I don't wanna.
---
The event isn't even necessary. The barrels in the shed thingie at the entrance of the mine have enough radiation to do the trick. I decide to shake things up about once a week and see what I get. 
---
qp
---
Just to note - it wasn't those mods only or in particular. My understanding is that it was any mod that relied on the particular archives in the previous versions of the game that were altered by the last patch.
---
Yeah ive done it a ton without one also. Apparently if you play 24/7 for the entire event and only do the event, you could do about 500 and have a 14% chance of getting one of the masks. Its pretty stupid
---
Yeah.. for me it is. :3
---
But think of the resell value if you get repeats you'll make Bank if you haven't maxed on caps. These will for sure become sought after.
---
Bethesda.net having issues, they’re aware of it
---
The word hate is toxic
---
Signs that Bethesda has given up on making money on the actual title and is hoping to make something out of the atom store.
---
You could make an entire sub for these posts alone
---
I’m on Xbox and can’t seem to connect to any server 
---
Cool story 
---
#5 - I set a box outside with a weapon station and a stove. Usually all a passerby needs.
---
I was putting a rad shower as well, but griefers destroying it makes me put it away when I am not using it. I can't wait till they get shunted off to their own little sewer.
---
I gave mines to bud , he doesn’t wanna sell it back ( of course I regret the drop but hey he won’t let go of it )
---
Not rare. I have received 5 from tech data runs. 
---
True. I just wanted to do the new added event for a cool mask but honestly I made myself angry doing it over and over and getting no new stuff.
---
If thats the case, rather be pissed now than later...
---
The point is, we can scrap a pencil and get lead....okay...if we scrap weapons etc. no lead normally...you have to farm like a hamster to get enough lead etc...for logic it should be possible to scrap ammo, i mean we are the mcguyver in the wasteland, so give me a bubble gum and a bobby pin and i will build you something that explodes 
---
Nope, The cap stash is always empty when you try to check for it.
---
servers are back to shit after the last patch, very disappointing
---
before that i would have told you yes, but its an online game, when the servers fail, the game fails.  and it fails ALOT
---
got disconnected 5 times yesterday alone, finally got so sick of it i just quit playing for the day
---
Yes that will work or should. Also I read if you buy it from a vendor, it counts as crafting as well. I plan to use this if I get a drink that is too tedious to craft .,,yeah game should be smart not to give you duplicates.
---
Seriously!!, never really went hard at making my camp, but that makes me want to make like a batcave/mothcave kinda thing aha
---
I got some problems to use the mic for long time (expecially since i'm not so good in english speaking) and the lack of text chat make me play almost alone (i learned hot to use emotes properly but it's not enough), but since i'm  used to play Fallout in that way i can get over it and enjoy anyway. Some days ago a friend bought the game and now i can try some team play. I loved the game from start, even with all problems it has, hope they will add a text chat (even if not global) so i can make more friends. Anyway i agree...the Mistress of Mistery Quest is awesome, hope they will add more like that
---
Very true. I would just keep them until either someone wants to buy it for a fair price or you gave enough to just give away
---
I had a shower remove my mutation with lvl 2 Starched Genes, but that was a couple of updates ago. It may have been a glitch they fixed. I haven't tried it since then because I'm too afraid of losing some of my favorites. Radaway doesn't take any of them away, though. Also, Nuka Grape gets rid of rads without stealing mutations in my experience. I'm not sure if you would lose them all trying to get rid of one or not. I've kept the couple I wasn't thrilled with and just rearranged my perk cards to balance out the features I don't like. Lvl 2 Class Freak helps, too.
---
In all fairness, a sizeable portion of the worlds toilets are "squatters" by design. In the Asia, Middle East, and Africa youre just as likely to have to squat over the hole to poop as you are to have to sit on a seat above the hole. 
---
Yes im here to remind people that its dead game and it has no endgame content/pvp
---
What can I say. The server outage has me bored.
---
Chalk it down to 'bUt I aM rolePLAYING As a rAiDer' or something.
---
the sarcasm is strong with this one
---
Have seen so many great outfits in Fasnauct.  Usually give people the taunt one.
---
&gt;Is it me or has people not keen to join the Scorched Earth event anymore? 
---
 Maybe because everybody already has their ultracite explosive vent plans?
---
Again I agree. I think it should be a perm switch. You take your current character over. They stay.  Too bad so sad. 
---
And all those “I don’t have time to make a new character and level them” people, they can spend time transferring stuff to their mules just fine. It a new leveling character is too much I guess. I mean it’s not like we have multiple characters before on other games. 
---
That’s interesting considering I’m playing right now.
---
Southeastern corner, right by fissure site prime. The BoS quest will lead you there.
---
I wounder if I can get a code from Bethesda so I can use Steam instead. I was never opposed to the Beth launcher but it's just nicer to use steam, something I already have.
---
As long as people aren't trying to actively ruin my playing experience, good for them.
---
I run around low level areas to drop off supplies, and get dailies done (do 15 quests while intoxicated wearing a beer hat). Yes, I run a PA build, so doing that in the Forest is a viable proposition, unlike higher-level areas.
---
It's best to always stash the gunpowder too. When crafting it's pulled from your stash, so no need to carry it.
---
Would love to see something along the lines of that INT check in Fallout 1. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IuBjeLiWhek. Absolutely hilarious.
---
I think people would be furious with Bethesda if this was some calculated duper trap, rather than just accept it as their normal RNG asshattery.
---
PVP is part of the game mechanics and saying people should just go play COD is bullshit. Griefers suck ass but they are the Raiders of this game. I could say the same to you though. If you do not like PVP go play Fallout 4.  
---
The most fun I've ever had in this game was when I first went into the mire with my cousin and a few randoms and all of being being blown away by how gorgeous and creepy everything was. We were up until the early hours of the morning, just walking through and admiring everything. Once we hit *Tanagra Town* though, that's when we were really blown away. That's the coolest location to me in any Fallout game. I really wish I could build a camp up there
---
Before we all start foaming through the mouth, is is 4:8:2000 or 4:8:2006?
---
Because that digit makes a world of different, trust me.
---
I lasted to about 30 before falling through a bridge. Lasted all of beta and another 3 weeks after that. 
---
I really like the nice people of the community. May be rare (at least in my case), but when you do see them they are quite the sight for sore eyes. I was playing with my cousins once, and saw a dude with a bounty of 5 caps. I messaged him and asked him if he wanted me to kill him to take away the bounty, I wouldn't take any of his stuff. He thanked me and said sure, and I followed through. He had done something menial if I remember correctly, I think accidentally damaged something at someone's camp or something.
---
Hahaha, nice. 
---
If only we could’ve gotten those rare drops :) we could’ve been swimming in some money for a mask 
---
Do you have Cap Collector equipped?
---
Ditto, along with scap, weapons, and chems I don't need.  I've notice other players starting to do this more frequently.  The Fallout76 version of take a penny, leave a penny.  I found someone had left over 50 glowing steaks one time😁.
---
I hope they will review the drop rate, or at least with the next event.  
---
I mean they're removing the fun variable by doing so, unless they do indeed want to turn f76 to a mmo.
---
It ends tomorrow. Not sure what time though.
---
What's the point of rare masks if no one is getting it.. five people allegedly..? They might as well say there was one mask for each... make more sense then simply calling it rare...  
---
Did they said anything about giving a Steam Key to actual owners of the game?? If so it would demonstrate that they actually care about the actual playerbase.
---
maybe to sensative kids like you.
---
Your guild literally made you a slave. "Gather our materials and fix our shit" Game isnt that hard that you need a designated mats farmer.
---
Don't know about explosive but I heard its usless for energy based weapons atm.
---
Gonna try that next time.
---
I was referring to the masks but good job finding the jacket!
---
Be able to trade 25k+caps, full sets of god armor/weapons? They'll be able to price the trades so high, that no regular player could ever hope to compete.
---
Could have had friends as lookouts.
---
First time I died was when I got a Bloodied weapon and decided to mix it up a little. Level 110 or so. Ever since then I've died countless times but the game is a lot more fun.
---
Ok, thank you great sloth! 
---
Have you been to the Mire much? It's really pretty, and has mutiple sloths. And as others have said, there's a pond in the Savage divide that nearly always has a behemoth. 
---
XBOX UK, can't log in. 
---
Yeah limited atom shop one.  Also had a hot rod power armor station u could get at the time too
---
Yup seems like servers are laggy , not like I was gonna get anything other then a crappy 1 star legendary and a solider or toothy man mask 
---
Sounds like a recipe for disease for sure. At least you'll be high AF when you're sick. 
---
Some people oh lordy lordy.
---
This would be fun to add as a follow up to the new Brewing/Distilling stuff. Everyone started making their own booze and getting drunk all the time [lots of daily/weekly challenges involved being drunk] and the next update deals with "oh shit... maybe i've been drinking too much?...." as you start to lose your shit due to alcohol. 
---
&gt;It's one of those flaming bags again!  
---
&gt;Don't put it out with your boots, Ted!
---
This is the best night of my life
---
Cause I'm a dickhead. Ba dum pssshh. 
---
MTTH increases with completed thressholds = 10x 25x 50x 100x etc
---
I run with an unorthodox build I'd describe as all-purpose cavalier-leaning cavalier sentinel mix. I'm weapon agnostic meaning I have zero perks that increase damage of specific weapon types. I climbed my way to regular godhood and asked if thats all there is to it, and decided its not. Instead of maximising damage, I tried to maximise various perk, legendary and craftable effects, and the only "main" parameter of this build that I maximise at the expense of other things is time spent sprinting. This has served me well both in powertesting (researching how much damage you can take from various sources vs what builds you can reliably kill) and in actual PvP. If somebody says my build looks like bullshit I will happily agree having just one concern: "It just works".
---
Personally I think it's less than 0.03% that would be 3 masks for every 10,000 runs, right? There are 4,000 people on this subreddit right now. 175,000 total. I have seen 1 non-pc post and a handful of (possibly compromised) pc post this week. If it was 0.03% there would be more pictures of people qearing them or with other players who have them. 
---
Personally, I like the idea of one day running into someone with an obscenely rare item and I think the event is worth it on it's own. I'm on the Fasnacht is fun side of the debate, I just wanted to give my two cents on the 0.03% poll.
---
Scared the InstMash out of me, I thought they found my paddleball string duping super secret technique.
---
&gt; Watching some dude firing at nothing, or chasing something that isn't there. Running around naked ...
---
Well, that IS what it looks like at the Fasnacht event!
---
No one's been banned. They've let the intern manage the login servers, that's what's wrong right now.
---
you dont need PA in the forest.
---
I heard from someone earlier that a person got a rare mask and was offered $500 for it. If they’re that rare I think it’s outside the realm of tradable items like you said 
---
Same. I pre-ordered BFV deluxe and haven't even installed it :/
---
I ran a Fasnacht with 3 Piper lookalikes. Wish I had taken a pic but the 3 were never close enough together.
---
the sad thing is, it will probably be sold in the ATOM store, as opposed to in game plans
---
This is all correct. Although some time when picking say legendary weapons it says it was an explosive version but changes back. So yeah. 
---
I think they changed the wording, but it used to be when I brought up the Steam overlay it would tell me "You Have No Friends".   I'd be like "Well what about ... but ... yeah, I guess you're right"  \*sob\*
---
Once I get PA sadly, it takes all of the fun danger out of the game when I can just spam stims whenever I'm taking too much damage.
---
I need to try and modify my build to incorporate weight management perks, otherwise I'll be living in my PA and it defeats the purpose of my build.
---
I agree. The event only has a day left so I guess I'm SOL unless I grind my heart out and maybe get lucky. But honestly I don't even know I've done the event so many times that I know all the robots dialogue and know where everything spawns. I love the masks but c'mon Bethesda make the drop rates reasonable
---
Xbox? I loaded in without realizing Helvetia was a nuke zone yesterday and almost died haha.
---
I only got those 2 recipes as well. I got another mask tho, last night I managed to get the Witch mask to drop from the event but that was about it.
---
Will there be cross play between them or no?
---
I cannot even log in. And even if I could I ain't touching it until the outage is resolved.
---
I'd rather be mildly bored than foaming through the mouth because I insisted on logging in a server I knew that it was unstable and lost 'x' amount of progress or worst case scenario items 'n stuff.
---
No sir... I am just going to be a raider for the evening while the matter is sorted.
---
I redirect you to this thread, from few minutes before yours. It anwsers it.

I agree 1-4 suck for sure, I'm a 5 or 6 guy myself so sorry for annoying you or causing problems
---
On Xbox. Atomic shop won't load and everytime I join a game it disconnects me immediately 
---
I got two back to back last week on Xbox 
---
Tomorrow when the servers go offline for the new patch.
---
They're not rare, they're bugged. 
---
That's a good idea, and it makes perfect sense. A rare thing on this sub.
---
You are welcome Wise Mothman.
---
Anyone buying plasma cores for that much is a fool. Make cores they are easy.
---
No lol
---
:D 
---
"While wearing a beer hat." I know you can do that in PA, but I'd rather not. Anyways, you seem to have something against power armor.
---
Hmm good point.  Hopefully they see this or are aware and provide a solution.  
---
Yep. Also if you try to logon to [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) site, no can do. Too bad that there is one day only free copy of Morrowind. But always on games are so fun to have.
---
Thanks!
---
I cannot join any server on XB1 right now - :-( 
---
Lol true I have so many toothy man masks those are my least favorite by far. It's just so ugly.
---
When I build my settlment camps, I place the radshower in the doorway of the "clinic" where the chem station is at.
---
Stove in bar/resturant along with brewing station.
---
Weapons, Armor, Tinker, and PA i put in a little hut. Usually in a more public space.
---
Might have to if someone has afk people all over the vendors in adventure mode lol
---
I would really appreciate Bethesda giving Steam codes to all of us who already purchased it, especially considering I  purchased the Power Armor edition before it was even announced that the game was going to be a [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) exclusive, and I purchased expecting a Steam code. 
---
Buuuut I'm not gonna bet my money on that ever happening. 
---
I haven't seen one, but I have seen some non-PC pics of people who have seen at least one.
---
Would be nice, but I'm resigned to never seeing one.
---
Thanks for the tips, all!
---
Wow, you should see a pyschiatrist.
---
ok, this post is the best. i approve of ALL these!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Ahahhahaha xD
---
I have seen people wearing winter and demon on PC more than once. 
---
Same. I would love for them to give us Steam keys, but I doubt there's a chance of that ever happening. 
---
I have 3 bomber jackets, hand in technical documents every day, not rare anymore.
---
May I recommend recording a video of your inventory by section? You can look at all your stuff later on. Best way is to go into modify mode and scroll through your weapons/armor so you can see each star. Also, writing down recipes and marking the best locations to get those ingredients. Maybe even where you remember caps stashes, power armor spawns, magazines, etc. Then you can move your camp near a triangulated location of world loot and ingredients. Finally you can design your camp on paper! -sincerely, an addicted person 
---
Omg the same thing happened to me yesterday! I had my mic on and I mentioned doing the Wendigo Quest, and this guy ran up and gabe me a bunch of stuff and told me where to find it! People are so cool on this game! 
---
Check the progress here:
---
One last thing I remember; I've read somewhere it has to do with the robots beeing destroyed. Has more chance to pop up if the robot been harassed and repair than not.
---
I could tolerate it IF it would stop nagging me for my password. Bethesda, PLZ.
---
The fingerguns? That's a good one 
---
I never noticed either of these thing's, considering we have no idea what affects the drop chance server side it can't hurt to go for the best result for both.
---
It's tomorrow as long as it doesn't get pushed back. 
---
Console only, though; no PC
---
How are people suppose to know if they can help if you don't put what system you are playing on.
---
Day one, I had a shit little house.
---
Guy runs up, spams me with trades, shits items all over the floor and then blows up half my house with grenades. 
---
I was on a bench at the time it was destroyed, so I was stuck HARD.  Had to ALT+F4 it was so glitched.
---
I was like, great, another game like this.
---
Next day, Fasnacht Event for the first time.  Dude spent the whole time using power armor suits to block the marchers, got us down to like 3 minutes by the time they got to the end section.
---
Dev room
---
Thank you! 
---
getting a few different messages ranging from launcher problems, account not allowed (something like that) to immediate disconnects when hitting play.
---
On PC
---
I would fully suspect this will happen, I doubt they will give current owners a steam copy though. 
---
Look for the Fashnact parade event, and fast travel to it. middle of the map. 
---
It will be here (town in brackets)

I am having similar issue. Stored a few things. 3 concrete barriers, 2 small generators, and something that I can't remember (probably turrets). When I got to my stored tab (in the same session, but after a while) there is only 1 concrete barrier and nothing else. IDK! I wish they would fix it, but i'm scared of what will get broken if they do. I also had to re-find plans for camp items that I had already built in my camp. example the wood stove. I had one already. I liked the red one from the atom shop so I bought it, but I wasn't able to build it until I found the plan again. 
---
You're free to call whatever you like but it's absurdely hard to die in this game if you play it safe and have a stimpack and some radaway keyed to the favorite wheel.
---
Hahaha what a fucking loser.
---
I know there are some angry people, and a lot like me are pretty frustrated with the way drop rates were set, but I don't think it quite reaches the same level as if people knew BGS purposely screwed everybody.
---
"...Considering the incredibly low chance of getting it’s going to be damn near impossible for someone accumulate more than a **couple of these**..." 
---
If you can accumulate a couple, then you need to stop what your doing right now and get to Vegas and buy some Lotto tickets on the way.
---
I have 8 on my character currently. 
---
I was so sad yesterday I hopped for a while to get a dog. Loaded back in and he was dead. 
---
None on console and non confirmed with pics anywhere 
---
Same, except I respawned in the nuke zone and somehow became immune to rads. Completed the event w/o PA (no intestines luckily) and farmed some flux. Was a good time.
---
ty ^^
---
As long as there is cross play I’ll be fine with my copy on the Beth launcher 
---
Says the guy who still keeps playing that shitty ass game :D look the reviews dude
---
so, cheaters then
---
That seems to be the placeholder for a players marker as they load in. When I load into friends games, they see me there as I load in until I’m placed on the map.
---
I cant connect on xbox right now either... 
---
It's completely server sides. You may (almost definitely) lose your photos if your hdd is wiped, though.
---
They're hunting the wild [Wooby](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/01/11/fallout-76-developer-room-holds-wooby-the-last-human-npc/).
---
No, it's server  side. If it were client side it would open up way to many ways to exploit things.
---
Low level players are much less likely to have the stimpack recipe though, and that needs tick blood.
---
Ticks are found easily near Vault 76, in a few low level areas.
---
With the invention of brewing, i also make sure they get a bottle of Nukashine too.  Then encourage them to have a toast with me followed by the "Oh my god you didn't actually drink that did you?"  I like to think i'm doing them a favor, would have taken forever for them to just walk to cranberry bog.
---
Need an emote for 'LOOK AT THE DARNED BAG, PLAYER, THERE'S STUFF IN THERE'
---
no i dont. I use PA myself. Just in areas where I need it. Thats the thing. People wear it in areas where it isnt needed, and it's kinda stupid. Also i didnt just talk about PA, it's using their best weapons too. They are fully armed, and armored to kil some lvl 1 scorched.
---
Forest is so weak, you can practically pick up any weapon and kill well enough.
---
Right, it didn’t work every time, but it gave me a better chance.
---
Maybe but no idea how you get in on a console 
---
Lol surprisingly, even though I pretty much live with parasites and dysentery, I only got a disease one time from consuming all of that. Pretty crazy to me, seeing as I can take a couple sips of dirty water before feeling Montezuma's revenge
---
the saves are on the server side. you log into your account and you start back up where you left off.
---
It would be fun for the people who had the masks.
---
Right now it's only fun for the three people in the entire playerbase who might actually have one. And you, for some twisted reason. 
---
They don't need to be rare to be fun. That's stupid. The idea that things are more fun when people can't have them is stupid. 
---
My friends that I’ve met on here are the best !We are all different nationalities,  some from other countries , socioeconomic backgrounds etc . but we have this game and a bond of loyalty to each other in common. 
---
We share support and back up each other every step of the way . If someone needs a plan a weapon mod whatever it may be , we share it all and we all benefit from that equally . It’s the embodiment of teamwork!! 
---
Yes, it is showing items that you have already obtained as purchasable. It’s likely related to the issues that people have been experiencing intermittently logging into the game too. 
---
Assaultrons in those masks would be a worthy pic, I'd spend the time to get every one for a compiled pic of the lot standing in line to start the parade.
---
Dev room is now in a seperate world space and no longer accessible.
---
It could be worst !
---
I've been staring at this post for 30 seconds trying to figure out what the flip is going on with it. Thank you for this reply it made me giggle :)
---
I like it when people help, but only with like slightly underpowered (for me) stuff so that it's not just Easy Cheese Mode.
---
A few bobby pins, a hundred or so bullets, a handful of stimpacks and maybe a few caps.
---
That sounds nice.
---
Is patchy. I could get on, then I couldn't, then I kind of could but the Atom shop - and related content - was not loading.
---
Staying away until things settle. These are definitely NOT the conditions I want to play a game where there is 0 chance of retrieving anything that is lost.
---
Servers are down, along with ES: Legends and Bethesda's website.
---
You can't check anything on your account right now because the servers are down. 
---
the worst part for me was I had just gotten a free day, so I was gonna go claim so workshops. I wasn't even finished with the initial "Defend X Workshop" when I got booted from the server.
---
I mean, I can say the exact opposite for me, but from what I've seen the real only reliable way to get springs are toasters and clipboards, and they are relatively rare compared to typewriters and desk fans. 
---
Would be nice to get some of those Achievements I keep hearing about.
---
This is wicked cool!!!! I love the location of it too!
---
I read that post and some thought it might still be accessible. Still no clue how you would get in using a console 
---
They're patching the mask drop rates.  Thought they were too generous.
---
That's a pretty good list. Agreed! 
---
I DARE YOU, TOD
---
it's so that new players/characters still leave Vault 76 on October 23rd. the date doesn't mean anything.
---
Maybe later, but itll be 1000 atoms. Lol. 
---
Not resolved for me as of yet. Atomic shop is greyed out. When I login it says world found then kicks me.
---
This is a really dumb question. The game servers will never be different for different game launchers.
---
naa no one is causing me problems. This post isnt even personal. 3 maybe a little. Was just a fun little top 6 list
---
They're not dropping. They're bugged. Just accept that. 
---
Yes, I can help you learn that helmet. IGN: jchamlin
---
I've submitted a ticket to Bethesda about this, after emails going back and forth they now assure me that a "specialist" team is looking into it and they'll keep me posted. Not holding my breath though. I have started a new character to get it done and so far so good. It would be nice to get it done on my main character though as opposed to the new one, I miss one hitting scorched with my ski sword!!!
---
I agree. If they increased the drop rate so that people who worked at it were probably gonna get a "rare" mask, they have made it *uncommon,* not *rare.*
---
Rare means you may be out of luck even if you try hard!
---
That said it does seem like the drop rate is overly stingy. 
---
This is my favorite thing to do. Every time I see someone leaving the fault I try  to be ready with some water, food, a lvl 1 and lvl 5 hunting rifle and an outfit for them. If I see someone a little higher I’ll offer to help make their existing armor better :) it makes me feel great, and I love helping. If anyone ever needs anything please don’t hesitate to ask :)
---
I mean what if the whole event was a trap. Surely it would work. Best way to make people show their colours. 
---
And coming from Xbox I can believe it. I’m on server Fasnacht event crash number 12. Like kicked back to log in page: “ the server has unexpectedly blah blah blah. Joining new world.”  What better way to get dupers to dupe? Tell them about a rare set of masks and how to get them only to not get them. 
---
Very confusing. You are tanky? You have sentinel armor, but also have all sprinting perks? Sounds like I would just use my black powder pistol for when you sprinting, gamma gun when you are stationary. Is cavalier the prefix where you gain armor when sprinting or bonuses when maximum health points? I am guessing a melee weapon?
---
I agree the drop rates cold be higher. But they shouldn't be ridiculously high so that everyone gets one. Eg. some people want bad luck protection, that is, the game guarantees a drop of rare mask after X attempts. That would make the game just a boring grind for the rare masks, as you know you shouldn't stop till you hit X even if you are completely burnt out. Moreover, people are gonna have a lot more bragging rights when the even ends. It IS fun for the people who have the masks now, even if it's just 3 people in the whole player base.
---
Something weird happens when they load in. It's not all the time, but it's like a 50/50 shot for me that they drop dead. I moved to keep a pet safe and it hasn't helped at all. I'm just done attempting. I loved my sloths but until they fix this I'm not bothering again. It's too much work and way too fucking sad to just lose it for no reason. I've lost four.
---
Thanks asshole
---
Oof, now I wish I would have got it for steam instead :c
---
Why did you have a bounty? 
---
Guy destroyed some stuff at my CAMP followed him to his camp, ran a train to his camp and let high level ghouls destroy his camp. In the end, I asked him what his dream camp was and I built him a fucking tower in Whitesprings. 
---
Sometimes when I have dupe plans I leave them in the Overseer's cache in Flatwoods up for grabs for the next innocent low level who comes by. That and a bunch of other things like full set of modded metal armor at level 10-15, ammo, recipes, mods, and chems. 
---
Wow! Love the roof design. What location is it?
---
Was disconnected upon login and all friends in social menu are listed as "main menu."
---
They have an outage right now.
---
It down for everyone 
---
Lol they're probably capitalizing on the epic store hate recently.
---
Trying to log in now and keep getting the same error. Or it just disconnects me from the server before the game loads. 
---
I think I went 20 levels between discovering Padded/Dense mods, and forgetting to put on PA for a 3-man SBQ fight. That was also a (scorched) yao guai.
---
Had other runs broken by walking backwards into a fissure while shooting scorchbeasts, and misjudged cliff drops. Non-bloodied rifle build with marsupial and speed demon, so it's rare to get into a situation where you're trapped by enemies.
---
Currently working on a shotgun alt. Fun when it works, but far easier to get wrecked by backstabs or close-range miniguns.
---
Me too 😭
---
How long do things stay in the world.
---
Let's say I dump a bunch of stuff I don't want into the Lunch Pale at the Train Station.
---
Do the items stay in there after I log off?  Do they stay until the server shuts off?
---
Its lazy. World clocks should sync, not calendars. It’s just dumb that they can change your pip boy with a skin but cant keep track as to how long that individual character has been out in the wastes! I know the two features arent even the same kind of same, but its something that helps me with my immersion in any of the other games..
---
Also, if you zoom out, that's the center of the map.
---
It's definitely a "0,0" placeholder kind of thing.
---
Oh, ok! I though you were asking because you're on pc.
---
I had not even any Owl mask drops, but a few soldier masks instead. Luckily someone traded me an owl mask though.
---
It would be even funnier if there was like a "Ghost Mode" where it hid the fact that you're a player.
---
I keep accidentally shotgunning myself with my quad TSE double-barrel so my survival rate is pretty low :(
---
If it were me I would put a post on  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/) 
---
You could try offering 200 caps or something to sweeten the deal and then only use someone with reasonably good trading karma to ensure you get someone you can trust.
---
If you were on PC I'd do it for free :)
---
I'd also recommend waiting until the login shitstorm has ended. People are getting very patchy connections to servers right now.
---
Thanks! There are lots of clues in the pictures if you want to find it, consider it a treasure map ;)
---
&gt;Paint me like one of your Grafton Monsters.
---
Your point about bragging rights brings me back to my last point. Why is it fun to keep people from having something? That's stupid and ridiculous.
---
I could see ONE of them being 1% and the others 5-10. That's a proper rarity. All five being 0.03 is absurd and may as well not exist. 
---
There’s a timer of how long you can sit at the vendors trade screen. And hopefully they lower the afk timer a little to adjust this. 
---
If you watch closely there has been another grey text box that pops up before finding server when you click join game. I don't have a pic handy but it says something like selecting game type. Only reason I've noticed is farming Fasnacht events involves a lot of server hopping.
---
Why can't we reverse pickpocket useless ass landmines into them?
---
I’m in no rush, really just wanting to make the connection so I have a person available when my friends aren’t 
---
And im at work. So im literally getting paid fo this back and forth banter.
---
but kellog isn't alive atm. cant have the outfit of an unborn man.
---
For a while my camp was just down the hill from Wade Airport, so I'd take that one fairly often - also a really quick run up the hill if there's a defend quest for someone else.  (That camp location was also convenient for me to grab the fusion core in the control tower before the spawn rate for fusion cores dropped)
---
But lately, Charleston Landfill has been my favorite - I've been using Chemist and Super-Duper to generate lots of diluted radaway to sell, and I can fill up Charleston with at least 6 medium water purifiers plus the one large one that comes with it, and generate a ton of water pretty quickly.
---
IGN oddROGUE. I'm on most evenings.
---
What a fucking putz 
---
I'm getting paid too( salary) nice ain't it
---
It's called a Fasnacht day surprise and its elegantly classy. 
---
LOL
---
I completely agree that the rates are ridiculous. Even if all the rare masks were 1% it would be fair IMO.
---
Picsssssss PLEASE!
---
on what platform are you? Had problems earlier on xbox, right now i’m fine.
---
Blue zip billboard just south of top of the world. 
---
I’m on PS4 I will trade. I kept the extras
---
Oh? Which one is that?
---
DEF NOT resolved, lol.  I cant even log onto the forum.
---
ugh yeah im sorry that happened to ya, its frustrating for sure
---
i swear disconnects go Up whenever you take a workshop or drop a  nuke
---
I think the rule is that speed boosts are capped to 20 or 25%. I didn't find that Speed Demon made a detectable difference on top of Squad Manuevers (aside from the reload speed), so that makes sense.
---
You didn't. 
---
Pretty sure it's 2006, mate. Calm down, servers are down now.
---
That's great since they literally hand you a bottle of water, some glasses and a pup tent and shove you out the door.  No weapons, nothing...
---
I did! 
---

---
Roadmap above. To answer your question, 9th april.
---
I am tanky. I can sustain lots of shots, but as anybody I can be oneshot too. I have more of cavalier pieces than I do sentinels. Cavalier is the damage reduction while sprinting. I dont use melee at all. Chances are and depending on the build you'd took me down with the pistol, I wont deny that, it should be possible. I think I'd kill my clone with mine, as its part of the eight weapons collection I'm trying not to be overencumbered with. There are lots of valid choices in this equation.
---
I’m in a safe spot I just need better luck taming and today the servers are junk. Do you know why a bunch of times I can pacify but not tame? Is my charisma not high enough? (7ish) I thought maybe camp budget and scrapped a bunch just in case. 
---
You are going to love the clubhouse ice chest during a Whitesprings nuke, then.
---
Every legendary or interesting item that you can't carry or don't want gets put in there. I have seen it have so many you have to scroll for days to read them all.
---
I love helping! I'm only level 43, but I ran into some level 5's taking over a workshop. I entered and they all stared at me. So I dropped about 50 purified water, some stimpaks, made the heart emolji and went on my way. 
---
I hope all new players have a positive experience like you did :) 
---
I’ve seen this too. My buddy died and I was looking at the map while he respawned and we were both in harpers ferry when he died yet on the map for me it showed he was where this market is but on his screen he was next to me. I think it’s just a glitch 
---
Nothing new. Nothing like generating fake items and fake caps that everyone will touch at some point and screw up the economy again. Yay....
---
Hey we are traders, we have PC, playstation and mostly xbox players. We are looking for people interested in joining us, so everyone is accepted. Here is our discord : https://discord.gg/sJbs6WS
---
Dude's got a wee few more views on his twitch now. Clever lad.
---
It might reset your survival time, lowering your ranking in the leaderboards.
---
To be fair, I flipped the heck out when I first got a 4:8:2000 (right after the wave of duper bans; at that point I had never even traded with another player). Was a bit more level-headed, though - checked the server status before launching into a reddit rant. They really need different codes to differentiate between "failed to log in" and "login actively rejected by servers due to account suspension".
---
Run speed (what speed demon affects) and Sprint speed are two totally different categories. I haven’t tested anything with sprint speed, but I can confirm that in the Run speed category no effects stack with each other. Cap seems to be 20% (possibly 25% with Speed Demon and Strange in Numbers, or Emergency Protocols torso mod with power armor; I haven’t seen a difference personally though.)
---
You're absolutely right.
---
I just want to say that if you even TOUCH the master volume slider (PC) you lose the ability to hear other players.
---
So, there's probably that.
---
thx mate &lt;3
---
THANK YOU! Seriously I couldn't find this on Bethesda's website or even by googling it!
---
And you obviously missed my point in the original post, and I did agreed with you didn't I.  so I do understand what your saying, but you don't understand mine now that is not surprising. 
---
I did a Helvetia event inside the nuke zone last night on a server that had 3 down at once, all in places i'd never seen. The other two were overlapping over the DMZ and nearby areas.
---
Honestly it was a completely wonderful time and a great deal more interesting than Whitesprings or Prime Fissure again and again.
---
Probably.
---
Btw , we are not only traders. We host events, in witch everyone is welcome. 
---
DAT LIST 
---
I didnt know it was even avaliable of steam. I thought it wasn't 
---
Thanks Prize-Bot!
---
Now, where can I get my 100k that's going to take a year to get, but that I'll be taxed on during that time.
---
If you really think about it they wouldn't move into the vacant towns because that's where all the ghouls are, as well as there being no food or water. In the forest, there is groundwater and wildlife. 
---
I know still just shocked that I had a "super rare item" myself XD
---
I don't know. That's still too little for a week long limited event. It needs to be possible to get them all with grinding. As it is, or at 1%, it's really not. 
---
I had a camp right when you get off the bridge going to the overseers camp. I built that spot up real nice. But you cant build there anymore. I was on a bridge over a river for about a week. Just tore it down yesterday. Im at the overpass on the highway right before morgan town. Trying to build a bar/inn that leads from on top of the overpass, to under the overpass. Also make it look like a checkpoint. Then im going to start nuking morgan town. People can use my camp as a safe zone.
---
Me too give me a few and I should be able to get on
---
I don’t die to ai enemies anymore. They can do whatever they want. Pvp is another story though...
---
I drop all known plans in the register at the Whitesprings crafting center. I see others there often. 
---
I have doubts now but I can't check atm
---
I have never seen that! Where is it located in whitesprings again?
---
Play it on steam? What do you mean?
---
It’s not available on steam I don’t believe, nor would you have any benefit of launching it through / via steam
---
It isn’t on Steam. 
---
No but it allows you to
---
Farm longer without making a camp trip.... also
---
My farming routes includes low level areas and high on the same run.... why not use my best gear so I do not have to change mid trip...
---
You don't. The dev room accusations ramped back up because people are jealous of others winning the lottery and getting a rare mask.
---
was on discord with friends playing the game, so no, it didn't occur to me that could be a partial outage :-/
---
It's coming to steam in 2019.
---
There's more to the game than PvP. Those people who treat it like CoD or Fortnight don't seem to understand that that isn't the whole point of the game. I've literally had some guy come into the area I was in with my team and say, "As you can see, I own all the workshops so that means I own this server. Leave or die." Wtf? That is NOT what the game was designed for.
---
Removed details as OP replied in original thread. The votes here mystify me though I shouldn't really be amazed at anything on Reddit ;)
---
If you walk west on the monorail track (literally on it) from garrahan HQ there's one on top of it at the end where the rail is broken.
---
It was announced today that all(?) Bethesdas upcoming games would eventually some to Steam and 76 will be on Steam later this year.
---
But... that's what... rare... means.
---
You seem to think "rare" means "early 90s comic book issue #1" rare. Or "early 90s baseball cards" rare, and not "action comics #1" rare.
---
Keep them rare. That's the point of them.
---
They tweeted today that they are adding it to steam in 2019, along with DOOM Eternal, Rage 2.
---
I believe the proper phrase is "twinking items between characters" and this was perfected in Borderlands 2.
---
[You dropped this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tin_foil_hat).
---
You still shitting ARK Style?
---
Yes, we do. And that is a suitable chance for something labelled "rare".
---
Homely means ugly.
---
You probably meant "homey".
---
Go to Ella Ames bunker. Then do Organic Solution quest.
---
And steel since allegedly my ammo is made with steel cased Russian shit cases......
---
It’s true, due to a bug interaction with the visual effects. They may come back at some point if the bug ever gets fixed. 
---
Because it's literally just the third person camera turned into No clip mode
---
Times like this really prove that people don't read before they post.
---
Check your fire, we've got hostiles
---
Done, hope you get something sorted.
---
It would certainly help their image in terms of good will to their customers to give current owners a steam key.
---
That's gotta be a meme they did.
---
TP would be one of the first things to run out.
---
That's good to hear, actually. I'm really hoping Starfield will be on Steam, but it will probably be on Beth launcher first. 
---
They only take up as much budget as a defense turret and the cost of those have been reduced. If you can't tame it it's not a random spawn event and you'll need to find one of those.
---
Makes sense 
---
So true
---
I get the same results, whether or not I have cap collector equipped (or even learned) 
---
Damn, well I'm sure someone would help, and anyways it nothing that you can find again.
---
Spoiler tag just in case... &gt;!There is an broken assaultron below the extended bridge to the Vault door that has an INT check providing more details on when MODUS went all GLaDOS on the Whitesprings. !&lt;
---
I just farmed like 8 of them (with Green Thumb of course), just to the west of Dyer Chemical (toxic region).
---
It was broad daylight, you just really really need to look for them. I picked up tons of pods too.
---
Well, there has not been any 'noise' about another banwave however there is a partial outage affecting a number of Bethesda's services and many of us have gotten the 4:8:2006 error.
---
Being stubborn and insistent I have managed to log in with at least one of my accounts but the Atom Shop - and related content - does not load.
---
You can check the progress here:

This one is unoficcial but is a good 'coalmine canary' of sorts:

---
They did give everyone who owned all the Skyrim DLC's on Steam, a copy of Skyrim SE for free when it released, so maybe, just maybe. Then again, that was back when Bethesda had way more integrity as a company, imho.
---
I have at least 2, maybe 3 on my storage alt, all gotten from turnins.  
---
We don't know, we'll find out later this year
---
Holy hell, you could have checked on server statuses at least 25 times in the time it took you to write that wall o' text!
---
And thanks for blasting yet *another* exploit for people to use. That was a real *upstanding* move, giving jerkoffs another tool to one shot people.
---
I'll have to test that thanks bro
---
I love going around giving people pumpkin pies 
---
Oh wow that's really well done! Please say they had a soundboard.

Explore and uncover every area in the game gives XP too. So does claiming public workshops. I got to level 37 in a week. 
---
Seems like cavaliers would be perfect for melee users then, yet you do not use it.
---
You have a very curious build. I wonder how it manages to kill anyone though. Maybe you use a gamma gun? It does not need damage perks to kill someone. That would make sense.
---
Can you link to something with patch notes, etc?

This is the sound of Bethesda giving up on making money on selling the actual title. The whole reason for not using steam initially was to not pay steam their cut and keep more profit in house. Now Bethesda is just looking for increased distribution in the hope that they can make more money in the atom store.
---
The further you go with your build the more you realise that PvP is decently balanced and that the playerbase is missing a key point that will become much less obstructed when survival hits. My point is that in this complicated rock-paper-scissors there are no tactics that will dominate all the other tactics, and that its not only your build that matters. Its also the builds of your teammates that are important, how they are all aligned, how you communicate, how you control the map, how you read the build of your enemies based on how they behave and how you pick appropriatr strategy to get through their builds.
---
The fact that visibility will be the key for survival in survival is IMO great - right now I can be stupid and I can live, but in survival I'll have to gauge for factors I can now completely ignore, such as the sounds made by my PvE encounters, as they will attract people from hundreds of meters.

I was able to login by using nvidia expirience on pc
---
Never tried, although I've also seen that the "Heart of the Swamp" has to be active for them to bloom?
---
I've seen that too.
---
Its the "I brought 50 raffle tickets and the person that won only brought 1" attitude
---
So this is the original paladin Danae then he became a synth in fallout 4??
---
Not to mention they’re just masks.  Not some special weapon or armor etc.  Just goofy masks and people are just devastated they’re super rare.  I think it’s cool there’s only a couple in the world.
---
It would be nice to have a not bugged event ... I couldn't care less about drop chances.  
---
People already complained about Fastnacht being too easy and lame - but it's happening in the "low level" area so that also new players/characters can join in!   
---
Just go nuke the queen or something and leave the "fun" stuff to the people who play this game for fun, and not for adding another challenge/chore to their day. Thank you!
---
I have the same problem can you explain how you solved it?  I can’t progress at all!  It means I can’t get PA frame plans for my dwelling now...
---
The Uranium Fever event also occasionally shows up there for some reason but when you fast travel to it you go to the correct location in the mine. I’ve only seen the Uranium Fever event show up there which is weird, but maybe because it’s the closest event to the center of the map.
---
Hmm. Only one I know that Iv been checking is behind the southern lookout tower. Luckily it’s not far from my camp. Any other good spots to look for them?
---
Nope I was just hanging out picking them up, no event. I've seen that a lot, I'm going with general misconception 
---
There was between ESO and Steam so I would assume it's a given. Bethesda doesnt want to fracture the use base.
---
Double mine and still nothing? Well at least I won't have to worry about it anymore in a few hours
---
You have a lot of hate in your heart m8
---
I have to say as a level 26 that logged into the Faschnat event during said nuke drop (must have logged in as it hit and didn't get the warning) with no power armor, I was not fast enough to get out of range. It killed my armor and took all my adhesive and screws I had collected to mod my weapons to fix my armor. I did not find this humorous. Not upset at the rads because thank God I had stockpiled. Wanted to start a donnybrook with the nerfherder who did it. But I forgive you.

 You guys are either Bethesda developers hiding as normal people or your masochists.

I am killing people by shooting at them until they die. I have a gamma gun but I haven't refreshed its ammo this month and now its close to 30. I am open to verification of what I said if you are on PC.
---
I wonder why they would go through all the hassle of making and designing these masks if no one practically gets to use them
---
Don’t bother, stupid people and statistics simply don’t work together.

I've gotten pretty good at this as I play the no strength stealth build my first play through of any Bethesda game.  I think I got myself back down to 88 last night.  1 weapon, 1 ammo type, cut back on aid items, and your weight goes down in a hurry.
---
My stash on the other hand always hovering around 650 at the lowest, because I hold on to weapons I either want to test or hold on to stray power armor parts that I think I might want to use over the Excavator (which I barely use anyway...&lt;_&lt;).
---
You taking about ultracite lasers and gatlings? I’ve heard that rumor a few times, I’ve no idea where the idea came from and have never seen any proof of it. Got a source?
---
They are recipes and in the plan section under notes.

Don't feel bad.  Their website can behave pretty oddly.  Especially on mobile.

High respawns happen anywhere outside of the Forest.  I think the prison, WV Lumber, and Camden are the only places in the forest I've seen enemy levels boost when a high level is around.  The rest of the forest does not.

Co-Commiseration:
---
 having been chased across the map and killed repeatedly by a trio with at least 1@ L100+ when I was a 15....It's why I rarely take workshops.  Dont need the aggo, and collect enough junk w/o them.
---
Attacked in a train station by someone 3x my level in chameleon armor.
---
Nuke zone last night, had just made L47, solo fighting a group of bloated ones.  L297 comes out of the trees and starts smacking me with a fireaxe.  
---
Same question as you - what can I do against someone 6x my level?
---
The little house - Pacifist on helps remediate that problem - and open mike.   Pacifist on so I don't do damage, open mike, to say oops, sorry.  (If you've done the parade or have been in a busy nuke zone, you have experienced   the nature of the chaos - oops sorry over the mic usually works.)
---
Several times @L25 an under - swarms of L48+ mutants in the lobby during the excavator quest (died a lot) , filling the streets at Lewiston (still died a lot), and the buildings at path of the winds (died a lot more). 
---
Went back (days later), all low level scorched and ghouls - much easier.  Except the Wendigo, but thats another story :)
---
Sorry to hear it, man. I'm on XB too, and haven't experienced any problems with the event. Haven't been on yet today though, seems beth is having service problems all around this morning.
---
Server hopping is not a trick 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Or were people who understand that rare isnt a garuntee or what it means to have "a chance" at winning something
---
True, I didn’t think about that
---
Oh i have a whole lot more hate.
---
No, straight slap without Wanted.  That's some good testing.  I'll have to revisit the reactive plates as I have them in my inventory waiting to use them again.
---
How do you repair the bots?
---
Possibly, the spinners just spinning.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, i work pretty well with statistics and im stupid
---
You may have found a niche market to sell them if you can keep getting them reliably. May try when I'm on later...
---
Currently doing this on my medic. 
---
naa, im ps4
---
Wait what? How?
---
This is really cool, I have not had good encounters with higher lvl players. Yesterday someone was in my camp smashing all my shit and stealing my things :( 
---
And what if I use an alt account to travel where I want to go, then join survival mode and party up, can I fast travel to my alt account? What if I set up my alt accounts camp where I want to go? I just see a lot of ways around the limitations.
---
I still try to do as much as I can, but that is pretty annoying. especially when they obliterate the low level legendary before letting the lower level players get some shots in. It's not like they need the lvl 30 10mm the pops out of it. 
---
I had that experience once. I ended up coming back over and over again just to take them out while also yelling into the mic "Get the f\*\*k out of my camp! Get out!" and punching them when my weapon broke. All that was left of my camp were floors and a chair. Once they were done, they gave be diluted stimpaks before they ran off. 
---
I declined an offer to buy something, was greeted with this menu
---
It's because they've offered The Elder Scrolls Online for free "today only" if you log in and redeem the code.  
---
This has put a huge load on their servers, meaning we can't log in.
---
Can you explain please?
---
Well 50% of stupid people are more stupid than the average stupid person. So there’s a bit of variance.
---
I thought he was talking about Prime receivers, being that they use ultracite ammo, I may have misunderstood until I saw the green laser comment.
---
Good to know about zealots. I had a hunch it did but hadn’t tested it myself. So would a zealots weapon stack with a prime receiver too? Might be an interesting niche role for a gun.
---
Explosive is normally a total crap shoot for testing due to AoE. I’m hoping that by using the lock-on for both, I can get some accurate tests since it’s a guaranteed hit. 
---
Can’t imagine trying to accurate test furious. You’d have to do it with a friend or 2nd character so you could see the numbers. 
---
These aren't rare at this point. They're mythical. Most people haven't even seen them outside of the bots.
---
Interesting how there's another answer here.

I have not noticed any effects from the Nuka paints in FO76...  I had T51b for a very short time, but my X01 is now full Quantum.

*\*Couldn't care less*

Have to agree.  And watching some of the people can be quite entertaining.  
---
Only real issue I have is when the Sloth bugs and doesn't drop....  
---
Then disappears w/o leaving a meat pile.
---
servers arent down yet
---
Yeah check it, definitely a nessecary resource to obtain. Just take your time and really analyze those trees lol
---
Get out of my camp you lot. I've been happy up here since beta without moving and this week it's been traffic o clock. 
---
Something fishy is definitely occuring.
---
What recipe? 
---
North of Abbie's Bunker. There's a couple trucks on the road north of it that point towards a fenced in shack with some ticks. Something spawns there, if it's not what I want there's another spot further north of that with a pond and a crashed vertibird.
---
I soloed it my first time with lvl 25 excevator armor, and a war drumb. I was like lvl 40-45ish
---
Yeah it's intermittent causing me login issues ..
---
Oh ohhhh, you fallen for the statistic trap, gotta remember that a lot of people are at the "average" and even 1 person being exactly average means that theres less then 50% above and below that
---
You don't like farming for Cat Meat as your main food source?
---
The excavator power armor recipe
---
I have a bloodied Gatling laser with 90% weight reduction if you’re interested in it
---
I have been helped &amp; helped others. Asking those helped to pay it forward of for no other reason, because there are are horrid people that ply this game. But it is fun and the comraderie is beyond awesome, so I want to do my part to ensure anyone I touch knows that. I've also been hurt and it sucks big time. But they will NEVER win! Enjoy the game. Hope we cross paths
---
Would be cool if this was true, but I'm pretty sure paint jobs are cosmetic only. 
---
&gt; Well I imagine you use chameleon or stealth boy and either sneak away or sneak up behind them 
---
That would be only the case if you can survive the opening hit. That is "no skill" hit, with 100% success chance, that does critical damage addition to stealth damage, and maybe even more if he that 0.5 to stealth damage increase. Can you even survive something like that?  
---
I found a 2 shot rifle. the one where you can load bullets 1 by 1. I want to name it "Cool Cowboy" cause i feel cool shooting it.
---
I had the same thing happen last night.  Level 198 guy and his buddy in PA with their TSE guns.  Luckily it appeared they had pacifist on because I was always in their blast zone, but none of the other players, most level 5-20, managed to tag the sloth at the end.
---
You’ll want a hazmat suit and lots of everything but junk I recommend 800+ rounds of ammo
---
I give them a machete, pipe pistol a diease cure, 10 stimpacks, 5 radaway and some ammo. I also guve them some food and water
---
Wow, kudos.  I just change the hair style and hair color from the defaults and play on.  This took some time.
---
I really wish I saw this as a main post on here, this has to be the most cohesive, thought out, and perfectly worded argument about the whole Fasnacht debacle.
---
You deserve some kinda Reddit cred from someone richer than I.
---
It's a lot like a competitive sports tournament. Everyone puts in their blood, sweat, tears (and time) into winning but in the end only one team takes home the prize. The owl masks are like participation awards the rare masks are like the 1st place trophy from a RNG.
---
Giving a steam code to everyone that bought the game sounds like a recipe for like a billion steam codes people are giving away because people mostly did not like this game much and few of them are still playing. 
---
I only took a pic when I started the giant ass saw thing
---
People still use Gamefly…?
---
Game is broken your not banned nor server are offline 
---
I have had a lot of people helping me out somehow thru the game, now sitting at lvl 62 and I am repaying that.
---
If I get legendary weapons of low level I stash them and pass them on to low lvl players, I have soo much ammo I don't need in my stash and every time I see a low levek I ask if they need any of that ammo and I pass it all to them.
---
Same with plans and mods that I have multiple copies.
---
This is the beauty of this game, sharing, helping others
---
Reclaiming the wastelands for Human!!
---
I doubt they'll be able to do anything about that. There's only so much you can do to try to limit these minor exploits by powerusers. My guess is the mode will launch fairly unbalanced and probably be a lot better in 2-3 months time. I still doubt it will be perfect as I could just glitch into the "basement" of my CAMP and idle for days on end killing anyone foolish enough to wander in through the one way wall of the terrain.
---
Hoping it's a stealth patch to fix the event drop rate...
---
am i the only one who read it as "I met the incest people on the game yesterday"
---
Dang , I really want it on steam.A bad game on a bad launcher = a bad game , but a bad game on a fantastic launcher = a really decent game.But I guess Bethesda ain't gonna do that so imma have to buy the game again on Steam when it launches there :/

Someone tried doing that to me as well.  I basically just ran right by them and ignored them.  I wasn't unappreciative of the offer and I didn't mean to be rude but I like to do things on my own.
---
 Not that I had any way to communicate any of that to him anyway.
---
#1  Don't kinkshame!  PA is actually pretty hot
---
to be honest i prefer steam
---
Yes, and if you'd bothered sorting by newest posts you'd know this.
---
that makes sense :-(  thank you for the additional detail... 
---
Please don't tell how to do the free standing walls. I use it to make I treating roofs and don't want it patched either. Well. Assuming it's the same method.
---
There’s rare, and than there’s one in a million. If the masks were actually rare, more than 5 out of tens of thousands of people would have them.
---
Power armor is excessive outside of nuke zones or unless you're carrying extra weight with it.  Some people like excessive and there's nothing wrong with that. I personally almost never use power armor because it disables all the legendary effects of your regular armor because it unequips all of it.
---
Yes, you could hire me as defender.
---
I was going to say that in my post but there is always that one asshat who has to provide like 29 cats in history that lived to be 30 therefore that cat could have totally been alive when the bombs fell and then I get down voted into the 9th circle of hell. 
---
this one game was client side.S4 league. We had gatling guns wth perfect accuracy, infinite ammo, infinite health, etc.
---
This game has like zero endgame, what good does it to remove all the challenges and twink them up to the least interesting part of the game? Why not let them play the only part of the game where the survival aspects matter and quests have worthwhile rewards? Are they supposed to be happy to just have the whole actual part of the game bypassed? 
---
1. Don't kinkshame, PA is actually pretty hot
---
And again people who bought first get screwed since they will be stuck with a shitty launcher. Ill finally buy the game now though
---
Whoops thank you !
---
*lived
---
Launching a nuke solo isn't too bad. Just be able to handle waves of robots.
---
If you watch a few videos ahead of time it'll show you the path to take (all silos are identical) and likely a few time-saving areas. Like if you want to just do the repairs or lock pick and hack your way through a section.
---
Being level 50 helps so you can get max level armor / spend all your perk points, but it's do-able with lower levels.
---
My first run with my heavy gunner I took thousands of rounds of ammo, a couple hundred of grenades, loads of stims, food and drink and..came back out with most of it unused. I suppose it's best to be overprepared than under though.
---
I just helped a lvl 35 buddy run it. It's easy enough if you have help.
---
It's not rare. They are 10 a penny from handing in technical data. I have no clue how many I've received from it. 
---
It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to launch a nuke
---
I effing love it when people give exact descriptive directions. Thanks. I’ll check there once the game is running better. I always get the ones like “oh look around Abbie’s bunker”
---
Shitpost
---
I had this issue an hour ago, on PC. Had to run errands so not sure if resolved yet for me
---
Yeah I met the worst fucking person today. Some guy on Xbox was at the Faschant Event and started fighting, I'm level 103 he's only 74. He must have a bloodied build or something cause he shot me even in level 50 X01. After seeking revenge back and forth he just kept killing me robbed me of 900+ caps and a inventory full of junk. (This is on Xbox and his gamer tag is GodsSaltyOne) I was upset and messaged him asking him how and he refuses to give me at least 500 caps back. 
---
I have about 2,500 shells I can sell.
---
im the last person to kink shame. We all want a spin on the Danse Floor.
---
Yup...You're definitely a friendless loser...
---
Don't you have pornhub to visit? 
---
Uh, that's because EVERYONE can read your comment history. It's not as pathetic as you'd like to make it seem.
---
It’s really amazing how they keep on fucking up mutations over and over and over again. I mean, what the fuck are they doing that after almost every single patch, a new mutation is broken...
---
Well that's interesting considering Elder Scrolls Online fully supports add-ons and mods and is a Zenimax product. They are definitely sending out mixed messages with this.
---
Oh sweet! Thanks
---
They don't really seem that great to me. They wear out really fast compared to non explosive guns and enemy specific buffs work better as long as you know what type of enemy you're going to be facing. Like when I go to whitesprings I would rather take a rifle with a 30% buff against ghouls than one with an explosive prefix.
---
All good. Yeah it seems that if you hit the sloth with TSE before it becomes targetable i can crash the server. Who knew?
---
It also seems that if ty have duped mask even though everyone has 3 of the standard ones the game gets confuzzled and freaks out. 
---
I hope this down time brings a little piece with less pinheads and dupping.
---
The other day I was doing some inventory management, I took a bunch of my known plans and recipes and stuffed them into the Overseers stash in the Flatwoods Church.  Varying from armour to Chem recipes and camp items. I hope some low level found them. 
---
And here I am sitting on 5,000 aluminum scrap =). I get it though. My first online survival PvP game was REND, which, today is pretty much dead. I loved that game though. It was mostly about PvE, and the PvE stuff was very challenging. You started off on a team, so you had friends by default basically. Friendly fire existed, but you were heavily penalized for killing your own faction. Each faction had a starter area, then the higher tier resources were out in the wilderness. The PvE enemies were extremely dangerous. They could 2-3 shot you. PvP was just as deadly, but it never felt unfair really. If I lost it's because I had inferior gear (my team didn't farm fast enough) or I missed too much. Winning involved fighting over contested areas that generated points which went toward the win condition. PvP kills also awarded points. It was this great blend of very challenging PvE with the ever present danger of PvP. If you wanted to make the best weapons for example, you had to mine 3 different ores and smelt them together. Two of the types of ore existed in the opposing factions territory, so you HAD to go there to take it, and they were incentivized to attack you not only for points towards the win condition, but also to prevent you from progressing in your tech tree.
---
I hunger for those organic PvP experiences, but I'm primarily a hardcore PvE player who has optimized like crazy for PvE efficiency. I worry that I won't stand a chance in PvP on survival. I doubt many people like me will be there.
---
Feeling salty today uh ? I will next time don't worry :) !
---
Good bot.
---
I just wish i had knew/had some way to decline requested items 
---
[Item declined:reason; It's my axe, you can't have it]
---
To whoever gave it, thanks for the silver!  I hope Bethesda takes a look at their policies for banning.
---
This is old bait.
---
Yeah probably a bad idea. I’ll be the guy killing everyone before they even see me.
---
So you you buy it on steam, so that steam could open up beth launcher for you? 
---
17,500 caps for each one if you have 20+ charisma (or 16 + 3 ranks in the hard bargain perk).  I plan to eventually collect them all.
---
Still can't login on PC 
---
I just helped a lvl 35 buddy run through it. If you can find someone to help you with it, it's much easier. Lots of people here would be willing to help out.
---
 It's easy to get turned around, and stealthed assualtrons can wreck you, if you're not careful. The bots spawn continually, so the longer it takes you, the more ammo/mats you're going to burn through.
---
Here is the rub, if you are that level and you have some high level friends with you, you are going to have a bad time. The level 50+ Col Gutsey HURT. 
---
If you go in at your level solo you may be okay. Keep in mind as you kill lower level bots higher ones to match you will be made.
---
Good luck and godspeed!!!
---
Meh. Makes that "one in a million" that much cooler.
---
I've got the witch and the weird napoleon looking dude. Do the event, get a mask, have fun... if I get some exceedingly rare mask, I'll wear it, just to be chased by people wanting to trade for it. Good fun. 
---
It's an arbitrary RNG loot drop that does nothing but add a cosmetic tchotchke to your stuff. Play, get lucky, or not... it'll come around again.
---
In the meantime, high five the lucky few that have gotten one, and stay jelly til next year. It just makes it that much cooler for the people that did get one. 
---
rofl!
---
*Bethesda wants to know your location*
---
For me the grief happened early (L15), lost the workshop, lost what I was carrying, chased across the map and repeatedly killed by a 100+ player.
---
I didn't take a workshop for a long time after that. 
---
I'm a 47 now - Last night, got attacked in a nuke zone by a L297.
---
list goes on....
---
OTOH, like code\_gate, most interactions have been positive - also early on, had a high level build a wind generator at my camp, built my house while he was at it.... another gave me a weapon that I still use.
---
I've tried to pay that forward, but I've found lots of lower levels run away or server hop. 
---
Pipe weapons default to .38, and there are mods for the Combat Rifle &amp; regular Rifle that allow them to take .38 as well.
---
If you can stand your ground in Watoga or the AMS Building inside it, you can probably take the silo.  Your first time, it will probably take you about 45 minutes.  Robots will continually respawn, but you get a bit of a reprieve as you clear each group out.
---
The silos all have the same basic layout and five main objectives:
---
1. Get past the forcefields.  You need to find a tiny blue card and use the scanner in the medical bay.  There are multiple cards for multiple players scattered around, so it shouldn't be hard to find one.  Then, you use a card slot next to a terminal to wipe the card, use the terminal to imprint your biometric data on the card, and run the new card through a different card slot.
---
2. Reactor needs to be repaired.  This is reminiscent of fixing the cooling system in the Powering Up events.  You bring down the reactor and walk up and "use" each of the steaming pipes to fix it.  Alternatively, if you Lockpick and Hacker 3, you can bypass this event.  This area is irradiated, so you will probably want Power Armor.
---
3. Destroy the mainframe cores.  You have to smash the little rectangular mainframe cores on each of the computers.  The lockdown ends when the integrity of the mainframe is zero.  You can leapfrog parts of this with Lockpick.
---
4. Repair the mainframe cores.  This is by far the most time-consuming task.  You remove the damaged cores and have to replace them with fixed ones.  The fixed ones are scattered around the room, but there is also a Tinker's Workbench you can use to repair the damaged ones using Steel, Circuitry and a Damaged Mainframe Core.  You keep the damaged ones after all of this, so you can repair them at your leisure for your next run if you want.
---
5. Defend the launch robots.  This is the big battle in the control room where you have to protect the 5 launch robots from the security robots.  If one dies, you have to use a terminal to construct a replacement.
---
Do all this, and you can finally launch a nuke.
---
* You put the Nuclear Keycard in the receptacle.  Obviously, you get these from shooting down Cargobots.  It's a good idea to bring more than one, just in case you screw up on the next step.
---
* You input the launch code, which you can parse yourself or visit the Nuka Crypt website (note: codes change every Monday, whether you're in the silo or not!).  Entering the last digit of the code will automatically accept or decline it, so make sure you check your work before entering that last digit!
---
* Now, you use the computer in the middle to select a launch target.  If you want to fight the Scorchbeast Queen, you need to make sure that Fissure Site Prime, in the southeast corner of the map, is in the blast radius.
---
* Completing the quest rewards you with Missiles, which you'll probably want to dump so you aren't over-encumbered after all that.  While there is an escape tunnel, which leads to those topside port-o-potties with the Mysterious Buttons, you can fast travel from within the silo to wherever you want to go.
---
I just want to play some soccer with it!
---
I just got in … so I guess hopefully the issues are intermittent … 
---
Yep hive paper has been around a while.
---
Giving you the excuvator armour is a nice thing to do. However personally I would sell or bin it. There's lots of clues as you do the quests that the armour exists. I did not see someone in a set until level 35. I did not even know it existed until that point. I only say this as it's part of a quest line. I forget the level you can actually wear it. But I liked the quest to get the plans and build it.. It's kinda fun having to play for it. Having said this though each to thier own and we can all play the game in our own way.
---
Came for mask, left glad it was not mask
---
Damn, was hoping the effects would carry over from F04, but again, can't really find any actual confirmation if they have or not. Once I get my T51b suit finished tho, might be able to confirm if the +3 Agility is in the active effects tab on the PIP boy.
---
Probably not but why should you?  They aren't unkillable so they aren't really the problem mentioned by the OP.  Most of the crit damage from crit builds is perk based not item based so you can easily fight fire with fire by equipping similar perks and buying a 1* bloodied weapon off someone if you ain't found one yet :P just my opinion. 
---
Besides if someone just does nuke your ass, you have the option to put s bounty on them.  Putting a damper on their stealth ability as they are now the only person showing on the map lol
---
Unfortunately that only lasts until you leave the server. After that, they're gone.
---
Not nearly, it's one of the rarer brotherhood outfits but I have multiple
---
Yeah, but Kellog had to get from somewhere.  
---
Not sure when in the memories the outfit shows up but he walked from San Fran to Boston so he probably walked through WV... 
---
I climbed the National Satellite Dish, it's fun and difficult!
---
That just makes me think of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4sDQAYTmXA).
---
You have a Tinker Bench, just need to let us brake down is all.
---
Write to me your IGN and I'll help you create a PvP toon. You seem cool and I want such people share servers with me.
---
Hrmmm. Username checks out.
---
As for your dislike on #5 player I have my base locked out for ransoms but I do have a trashcan stash box available for others to use. I just don't like people going through my things
---
So, In your world, everyone gets the same shit if they log the same hours.
---
Dude... that's like, the video game version of working in a cubicle. 
---
Came to upvote this.  We only know what they said in that tweet.
---
If you think they’re nice wait till you meet me, I’ll nice the shit out of you.
---
Smile to yourself as you walk along enjoying your extra carry weight. At least that’s what I do. 
---
Is it required to paint it to achieved higher rank paints?

"I'm almost level 178 and i have not found anyone that can kill me in pvp "

\*eyerolling intensifies\*
---
It seems like my refresh rate is a little faster than normal on the X01 quantum, but again, I can't really quantify how much and there's no active effect showing for it so maybe it's my imagination :-D
---
A lot of insight here, thanks! Gives me a good understanding of what to expect. 
---
No it doesn't. Fuck grinding being an auto payoff... that just makes the game a grind. I've played games like that... they're dull as shit.
---
Thanks. I did, one person is sending me their old Xbox one, and donations should cover almost all the games and the rings. The mods deleted our posts though, evidently it breaks the rules, I asked and it was due to something about reddits policy of personal information, and then they don't allow transactions of any kind here.
---
They can take perk loadout manager out of my cold, banned, hands.  
---
I mean I'm still running an unyielding cavalier (got lucky finding that) and assassins cavalier build just in case.   If you want to open fire that will be on you.  Just be ready to die :P
---
Melee is strong yes, but strongest melee builds also come with high risk (higher than any gun/rfle build).
---
AFAIK, latest nerf can with patch 6, I don't think there are many nerf since. They actually buffed some enrgy/heavy weapon.
---
 I have killed him with pretty near everything. Auto Grenade Launcher last time. I have a Cultists Dagger, I'll try that next. ;)
---
Also know as "The story of my life"
---
Remember watching commercial in 2006 or 2008 old asf
---
I had this issue constantly with wood at Helvetia as well. Once I couldn't milk Brahmins as well but server hopping fixed it. 
---
Also they can’t close/open a bunker “door”
---
30 minutes, according to some people here
---
 Lol it's funny either way, pretty accurate too!!
---
There isn't much of a point, but I think everyone tries scaling Seneca Rocks at least once.  You can reach the top if you're careful.
---
I had someone do it to me the other day then go about destroying my camp from the inside. 
---
I tried to get the free morrowind thing on their site and thought I forgot my password.
---
Well after resetting three times and it telling me its still wrong I've given up.
---
Except when you spent 30 mins powering up a powerplant and getting some resources being extracted, the jumping servers to avoid someone griefing you wastes all that time.  And when you are spending most of your time just managing weight anyway, that lost time is a bitch.  
---
Am I the only one who thinks it's illogical for a flying creature with ranged attacks to land and try and fight you wing-to-hand?
---
Melee is already OP...I kind of like this being the consequence. Maybe if you can piss it off enough first, then it will land? Or maybe it lands to try and eat you? (I think a Cancer Bat eating a player animation is sorely needed). 
---
I feel the down-votes already, but melee builds can pretty easily invest in shotgun perks, mount them with scopes, and have a pretty decent way of taking them down. (You laugh, but the scopes narrow the spread for some reason) Most of y'all already have TSE shotguns anyway!
---
I actually dropped my full set of level 30 T-51b Nuka Cola painted Power Armor outside the Responder's Bar in Flatwoods last night.  Decided I needed to finally get that out of my Stash for good when cleaning house.  It had been sitting there ever since I got high enough level to use T-60, months ago.  Also filled up the Overseer's stash in the Church with 100lbs of aid, plans, and ammo.
---
Someone hit a small mid-level jackpot strolling thru there after I left.
---
I find it useful mainly to escape not explore. If you get overwhelmed outside (for instance, by the ghouls at the Whitespring Golf Club) jump on a building and wait it out. That's how I've been farming for legendaries. Lure em out, jump on the building, and pick them off one by one.
---
You get it when you complete the quest I believe. Just did it too. 
---
Well I have about 500 caps to spare but I also have like 5 fusion cores to throw in as well at varying levels of charge. How much would you be willing to give me for that?
---
I thought it was my fault and have tried resetting my password about 3 times before giving up, glad/sad to see it wasn't just me.
---
They saw an account that participated in an exploit (breaking the rules they provided) and banned it. I don't see what's so wrong about this. I hope they ban more accounts like this because it means less duped accounts and less duped items in the game.
---
It appeared at the same time the new "purple box" vault did.
---
Yeah ive had people come up and try and trade, and the only things they want are my own personal weapons that arent for sale
---
It is something that has been going on for a while. I'm not saying they made changes yesterday but I am worried it's going to continue.
---
Can we play shirtless while wearing dog tags and Aviator sunglasses? 
---
Duping was somewhat fixed, but instability caused by those duped items were not. Think bethesda was giving dupers a chance by letting them login so they can destroy duped items but most of them just decided to hoard everything so there you go. re-ban
---
They changed it a while ago when they nerfed TSE's.
---
This. Bored of everybody saying we should all the rare items. I don't have one and that's fine. I'm not entitled to have it and happy for the guy I met that had one.
---
It would take you 30 000 times to do SBQ, it to count as 0.03%. I bet when next year this event comes again, you havent done the SBQ even 1000 times, so even tho this event last for week, every time you finish this event, it counts what? 1000 or 10 000 SBQ done?
---
Can't wait to see how the Vendor Selling features work. 😎 What I can't put in the box I'll sell direct to people. 
---
No, you get it during the quest from a terminal, which you use to do the quest, unless it was changed
---
I could 100% be wrong because I’m going off the wiki, but idk
---
some people say that the overseer's quest isn't technically over yet... but who knows?!
---
Yeah if we had a way to denote what can/cant be traded or even the ability to simply decline the request without looking like an ass, I'd love it.
---
Nice
---
Every time that bot calls me a chump I shoot it.
---
Yes that's true.. again I'm just concerned they are going to keep going down that route rather than releasing better stuff... this plus reduced drops as made the game less fun
---
Me too! I have been known to chase people down too haha. I like to drop a nuka cola outfit as well for lower levels because they are so cool. 
---
I heard a gal say she liked my witch costume in an area chat, then she vanished. So i went back to my camp and made one and snagged my extra witch hat. Scoured the server...ported too her yelling, wait I have something for You! She was pretty excited and it made me super happy to give someone a cool outfit. 
---
oooh yess i [know that feeling](http://www.securitiesdocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Smails.jpg), ive even tried the reverse, maybe if i only buy 1 ticket ill get the main prize, nope,[ i still get nothing](https://i.imgur.com/ThbkL6K.jpg)
---
Oh no I spent $20 on Ebay and they nerfed my duped tse shotgun
---
and these masks aren't character bound. Means they will become part of the market.
---
Never spent a a cent.. been playing and grinding for all my gear since day one 
---
Is this include the ini changes?
---
Ahhh... still though. Pretty impressive!! 👍
---
To be fair, you probably stomped up in power armor with a big-ass gun. If some stranger runs up to me in the equivalent of a tank, I'm not gonna stick around to see *IF* this Iron Giant is friendly, I'm gonna run for the hills.:P
---
What if all this time in order to get a rare mask you have to destroy the robot yourself to obtain it? Been focused on getting there masks that I've seen people run up to super mutant suiciders to take the blow. 
---
He was never unbanned and would have gladly deleted every nuka cola on his account.  The weekend when people were receiving the unban he was never unbanned.  
---
April 6th
---
J47.
---
I think you guys are reading too much into this 
---
yay?
---
I'm afraid I can't tell you certainly. It's a matter of how you interpret the wording
---
Or maybe a present emote! 
---
Same. I'd rather not play the game than play without that mod. Bethesda really needs to implement it as an official feature.
---
That's great for people that haven't gotten yet, but, just as with the immediate price drop, kinda sucks for those of us who supported the game early on. I would have much rather bought it on steam.
---
First off what are you doing creeping around a 2 week old post. Second go level up and get exp like everyone else. The community has spoken about this cheesing way and Bethesda knows and has or will change the area so you cannot camp there
---
You're adorable, generally speaking that's exactly how statistics work.
---
Yeah, that’s what I was doing, got super weird results but it’s a start. Another user chimed in, had similar results to me, but I would like to try more tests (results seem to indicate roughly 5% increase to damage per shot, to a maximum of approximately 60-70% on shot 10-12. My results tended towards 70%/10 shots, his 60%/12 shots, but the variable factors were huge.)
---
Prime stacks with Zealots, for sure. I had a prime Zealots 50cal for a bit, it straight up melted scorchbeasts. I’ve since switched to a bloody build and have a bloody 50cal, so I don’t carry the Zealots anymore- the situational increase that Prime gave over my bloody gun wasn’t worth the ammo costs and having to keep track of 2 50cals in my inventory/hot wheel. 
---
"fixed" 
---
The catch is that he never duped.  Trading items in game is perfectly legit.  The fact that he chose to trade a large number of items was a bad idea but Bethesda has stated they will unban and the items deleted.  This is not happening.
---
Sounds like a POG wrote this
---
Oh there's a carry weight bonus? Nice
---
What time are you?
---
Last patch, I lost stable flux at login due to falling through floors and eventually dying due to texture load issues.
---
Do what I do, Berserker Weapons, a lvl 1 Hazmat suit (no other armor ever), and try to get to 50 without using any perk points (I am currently 44 without using any perk points, All stats at 1, though I will use them once I hit 50). It is fun, challenging, and makes people question my sanity!
---
I did only changed some graphich settings and pipboy light color. That's it.
---
I mean, I'm a steroid junkie but even I believe in recycling. (Is how I can imagine someone justifying doing this) 
---
+20
---
Time for the second great resource war in the fallout universe /s
---
he didnt get his outfit till after he met the institute, before then he was using random armor ;)
---
As opposed to everyone grinding the same hours and nearly nobody getting it?
---
Absolutely. 
---
Okay, just message me on Xbox when you’re ready and when the servers are good again
---
There is 2 pictures of guys in ps4 with rare masks the winter mask and the jester ...
---
But those drop rates sucks ...
---
Responders bot is rare , bos jumpsuit is rare but the fasnacht masks are super mega unique rare ... 
---
Bethesda could increase the drop to about 2% each rare masks they still be rare but at least ppl can get it and still rare since this was limited to just one week
---
Ugly!? You enclave loving X01 wearing son of a....
---
 No I mean character with background and perks, need a story! 
---
https://goo.gl/images/nN8rUH
---
Haha, with the server issues happening this morning, I thought I had been banned too.
---
Then buy him a new account and get over it. He was warned by you not to engage in fishy behavior and ignored it. Lesson learned. 
---
I have two  beret s if you want i can give one to you
---
Look at the trade off range and being close range. 
---
Melee does need a nerf, no one should be allowed one shot another with such ease. 
---
Sure it’s fun for the person one hitting others. No one should have to log in and wonder who among us is running another one hit wonder build. 
---
Also, their rules never stated trading for items would result in a ban.  Except for people have large amounts of ammo or colas, I have not heard of another reason for people getting this ban.  Just a few days before this ban was handed out, there were a lot of weapons/armor that were deleted by Bethesda and that never resulted in a ban for those people.
---
A sample size of 200 for estimating a probability that is of the order of 1/10000? Are you sure you didn't miss your statistics classes, cause I sure as hell didn't
---
You might have more success with Alt-Tab if you change the windowed mode.  I currently have it on Fullscreen, but I'm pretty sure it was Borderless Windowed at one point, and don't have normal issues with Alt-Tab, although I haven't tried it under Steam streaming.  To be fair, it's really easy to confuse Steam, although when it works, it works impressively well.  I was playing Fallout 4 on a lowly HP Stream the other day and it was as responsive as it was on my main PC.
---
How much does berserker scale when you have no armor?
---
I prefer the trading interface because bags are so damn glitchy.
---
As opposed to it STILL being a grind, only in your world having nothing to show for it at the end because of shitty game design.
---
Yes, it should be possible to get them all.
---
out of 50,000 people, there should be 15. 
---
But, the odds reset with every event, for each person... so... good. If I get one, it makes it that much cooler. 
---
if I get one, and all anyone has to do to get one is grind the event 30 times for a guaranteed drop... then it's worthless, and it becomes a sign stating "i have more free time than you do".
---
As it stands, it's a "holy shit! that dude got a skull mask!" Trophy. 
---
THAT'S the whole point of it. THAT is what gives it some value.
---
I like it this way. I hope they keep it this way.
---
Well, just wait then. Bethesda never said they would unban those accounts when patch 7 lands. They said they would unban you when all those problems are solved and it's not solved yet. 
---
Who's willing to bet it'll still have the Bethesda launcher when you buy it on Steam? lol
---
I never had the key, just server hopped until it was there.  Door is usually open.  Why this is? I have no idea lol
---
Not likely.
---
And you can already do that.
---
Wow you have the two things I want most dearly, one day I hope to be so lucky 
---
Was it not on steam? 
---
I think what upsets me, is there are supposed to be **3** tiers; common, **uncommon**, and rare. 
---
But the uncommon drops are just as unlikely to drop as the rare..
---
Psn: Chlebostrom
---
I will give you 1k caps as motivation :D
---
Oh really? Hmm nice
---
Lol. Okay, you got me there.
---
Your son knowingly took part in the duping epidemic. He was part of the problem and paid the price. Pay another 15 dollars for a fresh license and get over it.
---
I lost 15%-30% of my DPS and all my burst damage thanks to the automatic weapon critical hit nerfs. I had to switch to a single shot PVP build because 12 headshots was no longer killing players or enemies. 
---
I went from doing 688 critical hit damage per clip to only 57 damage. A big F you to auto pistols. I switched to a black powder pistol so I could at least do 323 critical hit damage. I do not see how auto pistol users can naturally deal with sentinel users now. Low critical damage, no stagger chance. We need that critical vats interaction back.
---
The raider vendor bots! They have some of my favorite lines hahaha
---
This was a feature as far back as fallout new vegas. There's no reason it shouldn't be in 76. Selling to vendors should also be an option as well.
---
I mean, if you have a bounty, I'd say you're fair game. 
---
Show a link or pic of one other than the single player who had one on PC that might not even be legit.
---
There are some server issues that have been going on this morning, which could have lead to fewer people being able to join.
---
But also, a lot of people tend to feel that the SBQ is generally a waste of time, as it takes a lot of time, ammo, and weapon/condition to take her down, if she even does get taken down. And ultimately the rewards for doing so are generally just not worth it. It's a rather unfortunate situation for the game's only end boss to be in.
---
banners are broken, you're not a server
---
Yeah it works well. Something about FO76 makes it go wonky. FO4 worked great.
---
If they could fix that and SLI support I'd be happy as a clam. Only reason for SLI is that my wife's machine gets super bad stuttering when she turns it on. She has two 970's in her machine. Runs buttery smooth with SLI turned off though.
---
Well, by order of succession, if there's only one member left, they are the de-facto general.
---
It's knight_wanderer, my alt account is knight_wanderer2. My main issue is that I run a bloody heavy weapons build. usually run around in t-51b with only 19% HP. My damage output and pve clear speed is insane, but I'm sure I'll get one shot in pvp, even if I put on blocker and other pvp oriented perks. My only saving grace is a bloody explosive harpoon gun, so IF I happen to see them first, I can probably get a one shot kill. Also picked up a bloodied Gamma Gun last night, which sadly it seems only the physical damage scales with bloodied. I've got a bloodied or AA variant of most melee weapons, as well as a bloodied dragon and bloodied gauss rifle, so a stealth sniper character is an option, as well as a melee... or maybe a hybrid. I've largely ignored pvp because I'm lacking the full 3 star armor set, and i kinda feel like... unless I have the perfect gear, there's no point.
---
The other thing is... I just don't see PvP as an efficient way to farm caps. I guess it is now, with them doubling how much you get... assuming people actually have caps on them and don't transfer them to an alt account, which I'm assuming most will. And even then, I have like 50K caps... not sure what I'd need more for. As for the aid items / junk.. well, my junk mule has 3-5K of every resource except acid.
---
If they made workshops output like 20x more stuff, that might make it worth it. Or if you got more drops from SBQ, higher chance for 3 star legendaries in the wild, etc. 
---
I killed a 3⭐ sentry bot at the rail road thingy near mid of map and it didn't drop one. I let it mutate before the coup de grace, waited 5 mins checked again. Went to clear the train hangar, came back and checked the bot, still no legendary.
---
I have seen the drills and syringer, they make sense (it's just a bad listing on the drop pool) but the sentry Bots is the only one I have confirmed don't drop a legendary. 
---
I think not many notice this because they are not common, and legendary ones are quite rare. 
---
I love this game and play everyday but physics and common sense isn't their strong suit. 
---
They never said all the problems.  They said when they patch the duping glitch.  They have now patched 3!  Its an online game and will always have duping glitches.  I have never known an online game to NOT have that issue.  Basically Bethesda is saying this account is perma banned!
---
While they should change the wording, it’s still a warning
---
Just ignore them. They time out after a few minutes.
---
If people would shoot me a short msg first, I would more than likely join, but I don't find myself trusting of random invites.
---
People don't get that perk sets are a thing and can drastically change a situation sometimes 
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1110235368673210368
---
NOPE!
---
&gt;This is the sound of Bethesda giving up...
---
Man, I don't know how many times I've heard that BS over the last few months. Bethesda supposedly gave up before Christmas according to all the haters.
---
But yet...every time I logon, server is full.
---
*shrug*
---
"work".
---
It's a video game. It's "play", with an arbitrary reward for said play.
---
Chill man. It's a meaningless, valueless tchotchke that will have no bearing on your life in five years when you no longer play this game at all.  Just like all that shit we did the grind for in Battlefield 2 and Team Fortress 2 and a million other games. 
---
Just chill, and be happy if and when you get it. More importantly, be happy for those who did. 
---
 I thought it was just the guy who took the plan left it open. You got it with an open door? Seems fucked up. ;)
---
Yes, but I've only gotten it once towards the beginning of the week. I have multiples of all the common masks but nothing rare. I have most of the plans but not all of them. I'm missing the donut recipe and a few camp items.
---
I don't know why I never saw it the 1st time through. I'm gonna go run that mission again and see what happens.
---
My bad, its the 9th
---
would buy it through steam....so much cheaper else where plus steam is so bloated...they need to slim down it launcher.....I personally avoid steam vavle are not a company i like to support they are anti-consumer and bad for the gaming industry.
---
I don’t know a trick for cap collector but the stash itself, sometimes you can fast travel somewhere and come back. Then it shows. 
---
Agree to disagree.
---
Not everybody gets a damn trophy. Sometimes you play and lose.
---
Does that mean they are using the same servers for fo76 also?
---
And can I download that on ps4??
---
Ah, that makes sense (in a Bethesda sort of way)!
---
Try batteries included perk.  with that, my cores weigh 0.3. 
---
What level are you?  Asking b/c my low level core consumption was very high - I could burn a complete core walking from top of the world to helvetia; 
---
I'm usually carrying too much to fast travel, so I walk/sprint everywhere, and farming the spawn sites I know about.
---
I've also noticed as my level goes up, power burn rate has dropped - dramatically.  Whether thats the perks I have loaded or part of the leveling process, I dont know.
---
Seems to me I'm doing about an hour+ in WS on about 30%.  
---
I Bethesda has issues atm. I cleared my cache and was able to get in.
---
im in a server now and have been all day
---
He doesn't have to do the dupe himself, accepting a trade of 100000 nuka colas (your some isn't ignorant enough to believe these were legit I don't think) is participating in an exploit and like Bethesda stated they would provide bans for this. He tried to gain and unfair cheaty advantage and got banned for it. 
---
If he didn't partake this wouldn't of happened it is his fault so you can say it's Bethesda's fault or "they don't care as long as they have your money" but as soon a you purchase the game you agree to follow these rules and agree that if you don't follow there is a high chance you will be banned.
---
I dont know where you get an account for $15 but its not that price for xbox.  Also, the duping issue was caused by Bethesda being lazy with their programming.  Punishing people for trading for in game items is not right.
---
Up voting for relevance
---
Yeah the trade off is currently you either keep you distance and hope to get a head shot in.. you miss or are seen you're screwed especially if you're a bloodied build as you'll have no health to take any damage.
---
Or you go in melee with a stealth boy, still wouldn't see you coming and you get one shot.
---
Couple of easy examples both of which seem fair to me as it's about the tactics as much as weapons
---
Cleared your cache ?
---
Yeah I YouTubed it on first day. Girl did s tutorial, and didn't get it. She server hopped and got it.  So now that's what everyone does it seems lol.  I have two of them now actually.  Two extras
---
Yeah some of them deleted their items but they are minorities. Most of them would just sit there and think of any workaround they can come up with to somehow move those items to other characters without losing any. 
---
I'd like to see a main menu option for transferring items. A sort of cross-character stash. By doing it from the main menu it would also keep the extra items from needing to be loaded on the game servers, which seems to be an issue the game has. A way it could work is: 
---
* Main Menu item for I.T.E.M.S Box (Inventory Transfer and Enhanced Management System)
---
* I.T.E.M.S opens up a menu with all items in it on the right and your currently selected character's S.T.A.S.H. on the left.
---
* From  here you can move inventory between STASH and ITEMS. Since it's not on a  server, there's no worry about large quantities of items hurting much.
---
* The  ITEMS box would be tied to the player (not character) allowing all your  of characters to share the same inventory in the ITEMS box.
---
If it's a meaningless, arbitrary reward, then who cares if it's rare or not? Let people have them. Let people enjoy the game. It SHOULD be play, but having five masks with less than a 1% chance makes it work.
---
It is slightly random. It spawns in one out of three places.
---
So are you saying there are no issues with the login server and all the posts I'm reading are fake?  Woah....
---
They do not state it in their rules though.  And they have left many other accounts alone after deleting obviously duped weapons/armor.
---
Pacific time.
---
Sorry, i mean the error initially mentioned here has been fixed for me. Im not having anymore issues other than the atomic shop not loading at all...
---
This is a fantastic story and reflective of most of the encounters I have had as well. Lots of really great people playing this game. 
---
I lock my doors because it's my home. I live my water purification pumps unlock. Take all the water and vegetables you need.  Just stay out of my house.
---
Rather I'd have preferred they tied them to a faction level later when factions might be actually implemented.
---
&gt; xboner
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Yes! I have long wanted more station options on the juke
---
im not saying there couldnt be a problem but everyone that i play with has had no problem logging in today
---
 Cool. I'll do drive by's till it drops. Thanks eh'.
---
50% damage boost
---
Too soon.
---
... You may have missed my point. I literally did the exact same thing they did, to show them exactly why they got that reaction.
---
And there's better than %50 odds I'm older than you, mate.
---
No they seem very confused.. cards now seem to not make the difference they should whether your a melee build, sniper, whatever none of it is in line with anything else 
---
I’ve got a two shot explosive prime minigun I wanna name DOOM
---
So I should find the photomode pic I took next to him, upload it, get the link and post it for you to dismiss anyway even if I bothered? You're salty you didn't get one. Get over yourself. You're owned nothing. I don't have one either and that's fine.
---
My buddy had one he got from someone from the dev room, we need a recorded drop.
---
I can dig it.
---
You are what we call a sociopath. You should seek help. 
---
I've looted several from static spawns, fusion generators, and ammo crates, and they have all been of varying charges. Most have been 50-100% though, so maybe your luck score finally affects fusion core charge just like weapon durability, because I have a 15 Str/luck shotgun crit build.
---
*sigh* if only they had text chat.... even if it was an "in trade screen only" text chat
---
Punishing people for knowingly trading for duped items is perfectly right. Your kid bought over 100k nuka colas. Teach him to accept the consequences of his dumbass actions instead of blaming someone else for not being fair.
---
I think the community should make a massive feedback about the drops ... and ask for another week of the event with buffed drop rates or a exchange system ... like change  15 commom masks for a rare mask limited for a week...
---
Can't wait to use my Berserker Explosive 50.cal and Berserker explosive reduced weight Gauss at 45!!! SO CLOSE!!!
---
I'm downvoting you for the shitty attitude, actually. 
---
My son just wants to be able to get back his level 140+ account.  He and I both tried to log him on that entire weekend.  We even talked about deleting anything that Bethesda might have as a reason to ban him.  If his account had been unbanned, we would have done that.
---
Sorry, I misread. And considering what a PITA it is to get the plan, I am not shocked at the price.
---
I too feel this is OK for a cosmetic item.  
---
The rarity is what gives them value. That's it. That's all. 
---
Not rare? Worthless. 
---
Everyone gets one? Worthless.
---
Everybody running around in a goblin mask? No longer fun.
---
Then, it's worth as much a pipe pistol. Nobody cares about them.
---
It will always be too soon, never forgettii
---
&gt; - Bee Swarms: Are now visible.
---
I swear this exact same thing was said to be fixed in a patch like 3 months ago.
---
Did they nerf things again with latest patch?? 🤣
---
15 minutes and 125 weight... This is the Fallout 76 subreddit, what game are you playing?
---
It's inconsistent. The login service keeps going down for some players. So you may have no problem at all or get disconnected fairly regularly. The "I've been banned posts" are indeed funny though 😆
---
I played before work this morning as well.  But the psa is more for people to stop making new posts asking about the severs having issues when there are so many clearly having issues lol
---
Why not..? It’s a different take on the area and those who weren’t interested could hop servers. Haven’t been through it yet, even at lvl60, but understand it takes effort and time to get to the stage to drop a nuke..?
---
&gt; is it just because Obsidian didn't make it and its not new vegas?
---
It's exactly that.
---
Why do I feel like there’s more ranks coming to knight paints? And also will we get more things like maybe something called lieutenant? Or other military ranks?
---
I was trying to get the Free Morrowind game too. I reset my password twice and still get the error that my name and password are wrong. I was trying to log in the Bethesda.net.
---
Vats crit, 1 shot dead. Next.
---
What ^that guy/gal^ said...
---
Yeah, if he/she wants to lock their stuff then good on them. That is their base
---
Yeah I will give the set I have right now to someone once I get the plans. The arms will be very useful though.
---
Yeah there’s a few ways to about it, again tho I’m not against group PvP just zero cap exploiting.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking.
---
I did this the other day. Needed a craft bench but they were locked up. Made it my mission to get inside. Found a way in, used the crafting, and left a pile of meat + an Insult Bot flyer.
---
Slept in their bed for a while, was hoping they'd come find it and i'd laugh but i got bored of waiting around.
---
Hope they injoyed their insult. 
---
Well then stay banned. I don't see any reason why bethesda or normal players would want to have potentially toxic players unbanned. Bethesda is being generous if unban happens
---
I can’t wait.
---
The Butcher: You are were one of the many cooks in Vault 76. After years of being trained by your late father you took the GOAT and got accepted to the job. 
---
Always one to cook using dangerous techniques with fire. In the week leading up to Reclamation Day you spent all your time make everyone’s favourite meals. 
---
Once you leave the Vault you rebuild doing the only thing you know cooking. 
---
Armed with the Flamer and shishkebeb and your trusty Molotov’s the people will not go hungry.
---
So you think because you have done the event 113 times you should have better odds then the person who has done it let’s say 10 times correct. That’s entitlement right there, you think just because you have done something more then someone else you should have better odds at a reward. 
---
You also say that “everyone getting a reward is not the same thing as serious efforts getting recognized”.  But it is the same thing, if you put in serious efforts in let’s say a sport and you lose should you still be rewarded for your effort? It’s the exact same as this. 
---
Then there is the best line I have seen. “There are literally so few that maybe two people have come forward with masks”.  I would bet that most people who play the game are members of this subreddit and even if they are they probably don’t care enough to post a picture of a mask in the game. 
---
This is what I've been waiting for, want to basically have my character as 76's version of Sierra Petrovita with Nuka Cola themed everything at my camp
---
I’m glad to hear!
---
I love those encounters. There are a lot of cool folks who play this game.
---
Yea it sucks.
---
Got 2 before I got the key...
---
Got a 3rd when I got my key
---
The churches, with the pagan-esque idols in them, and the sacrificial altars
---
That would've made my day to be honest, but nope :)
---
Can confirm also other Latinos in construction will fuck with you. Once drop kicked a port-o-potty with a co worker in it. 
---
This. I will always ask politely and offer if I want something you are active or using, but I never get mad. Also why I went shotgun instead of rifle, most people don't want their shotgun shells.
---
That's just not true at all. No, everybody won't be running around in them. Not after a week. Then, only the people who actually like and want them will be using them. And it will be fun to them, rare or not.
---
The whole idea that something is more fun to use on your character because others don't have it is ridiculous. Keeping people from having something they want shouldn't make it more fun for someone else, that's kind of fucked up. 
---
Yea it’s acting crazy 
---
I don’t know how many times that I’ve purged mine and it’s still hit and miss.
---
I got mine in Dec., and never had any game breaking issues, or server disconnects. People from Beta I've spoken with said it was a hot mess at launch, so I'm glad a waited a few weeks.
---
I love the game, even *with* the %@&amp;#, &amp;#%@$*, $*#@ing Fasnacht event.
---
What did he do to you to make you speak like someone from 4chan?  From his comments here he seems very educated
---
No, if you die and can’t cover the cost of your death, with or without a bounty, you do -50% damage to players for 4 hours.
---
I've heard that before then as well as since, so I'm sure I just caught a bad glitch. I recently got the mutation back that I lost then, too, so yay!
---
Indeed there is.
---
👍

Ofc I’m thinking of PVE character 
---
IGN is WanderingWolf15. Feel free to add me, I'm on PST time. I'd love to have some people to run with, especially with survival launching tomorrow!
---
Me too. I have a fully modded combat shotgun, and all the damage and crit perks, plus 3 ranks of concentrated fire. They wouldn't even be able to exit the screen.
---
So confident :) guess you missed the part where they are changing how damage works.
---
Here you go sir.
---
Tuned for Combat
---
We’ve made some over-arching adjustments to PVP damage in Survival Mode to make weapons feel even more deadly in your hands, while also limiting the likelihood that another dweller can drop you in one hit
---
are you really not gripping the difference between a participation trophy and earning a reward?
---
As a high level character I help lower level players when I'm able, giving any known plans, spare ammo, weapons, or armour I may have on me.
---
I've also started contracting C.A.M.P builds for a moderate price, so if anyone is interested, shoot me a message.
---
Very frustrating 
---
They are fine now. The bag doesn't build until you exit out of the pipboy. Then it builds it at your feet like normal. It takes a few seconds. When you exit out of your pipboy look down at your feet and you'll see it appear.

Any of you guys able to let us know if people who already own the game will receive steam keys for it or the ability to link their Bethesda account to steam?
---
Yeah this. Learning experience for him. Make him do extra chores and earn allowance that he can put towards the purchase of a new account, and this time he will have learned his lesson. I botted and was generally an illegitimate player in Diablo 2 and got banned. Honestly it was for the best, as I'm now a purist legit player in all games. 
---
I'm gonna have an aneurysm if I see this question again...
---
There's more of that attitude.
---
But I'm sure you know my reasonings better than I do. 
---
My NO STEAM NO BUY strategy paid off!
---
It's literally a gamble. 
---
Casinos don't give everybody ten bucks to "make sure they're happy.
---
Lotteries don't hand out participation prizes, because you played every week this month.
---
it's meant to be a luck of the draw reward. it's meant to give rewards to folks for playing... why does the dude with four kids and an hour a week to play deserve less of a chance?
---
The fact a player can devote 8 hours a day to the game doesn't make them "more worthy" of something. he paid just as much for the game as you did.
---
Yeah after resetting I went so far as to do the account recovery option, only to figure out I have no idea *when* i made my account and there's no way I saved an email from probably years ago (one of the requirements for account recovery is **date of account creation**)
---
Since launch. But it hasn't worked the last few times iirc
---
On top of whitesprings!
---
Atomic shop up but still missing emotes ingame
---
Stop by the entrance to Morgantown and grab yourself a free party hat!  :)
---
I really love the idea! I will do that build it’s really amazing! 
---
And I can do the shop! Shop to sell the food! When patch is online. Thx a lot! 
---
First chainsaw, then un-equip and present goodies... wish there was a better way to signal to look down at the bag than tea bagging it though. I mean, who wants bagged goods??
---
It's a travelling and bids have been ridiculous lol. I pulled it as I started to realise its value. But last bid I had for that was 15k!!
---
Hey also you might be interested in re-reading this part of the announcement:
---
They persist beyond you or suitcases  couldn’t be used to pass things to ones own mules (and they can). I’m not sure how long they last. 
---
Or you can patiently wait until bethesda unbans you. Why sould your son get the privilege and given another chance? They will unban you when the time comes. Stop whining
---
I agree with you 100%
---
Power down the Xbox by holding the logo on the Xbox till it turns off. You know you’ve done it right when you see the green splash screen when you power back up.
---
I actually rarely use my power armor anymore. It moves slow, and I actually lose carry weight in it.
---
Yeah but it does and there needs to be a better punishment even if they’re not on a team. I’m excited for new content aswell but this threads more about zero cap PvPing which needs to be fixed before they release new content, along with some other exploits aswell.
---
I highly doubt it. People will just sells the keys.
---
Don't forget a rolling pin.
---
You should find the tree house in that area...
---
Thought about a corn joke but thought better of it...it may be a priority thing.  For me if I have turrets enemies take them out first and then move on to my garden.  Otherwise they focus on my generator(s) first then my garden.  But they don't pick on my corn exclusively, they are equal opportunity to any of my crops
---
Sorry I used to play with a different fish i guess.
---
Toxic player? Really!  Where do you come off with that?
---
I know this may seem basic, but Lucky hole mine, and the assylum.
---
it's the screeching that gets louder as you get closer to the obilesk.
---
the assylum. There is a section I call "The section that dont exist." You only can get to it by a collapsed piece of ceiling. There is a room that has written on the wall "Nothing is real." And a headless skeleton sitting in the room. On the floor there is a brahmnin skull. And there is a coloum with just a ligter on it.
---
They have to be quick to get away from me.
---
That’s how it should be when in adventure mode. 
---
I guess they are trying everything they can to boost sales except making the game better. By better I mean less crashes, more stable servers, better optimization etc.
---
Especially the flooded bunker to me
---
I thought someone on here tested that and found they last until the server shuts down or resets bags.
---
Thats why I thought maybe the ability to link the accounts together so can only play owned games
---
Mostly that people are starting resist radiation so gamma guns aren’t all that helpful. 
---
Always carry a land mine. 
---
Also that’s why I don’t run bloodied. Instigating is so much more worth. 
---
And the little blitz thing melee gets is not good. You can’t do anything to counter that sans for dodgy and blocker. Which work when they want to. 
---
In my opinion it’s not as creepy when you find out it’s all set up
---
I've been doing that too, but it's so sloppy. I need to organize better. I'm on my way home now to see if I have conduits
---
I love helping people in this game. I usually start with the essentials like Stimpacks &amp; Radaway, then gather up a bunch of legendaries adjacent to their level and help them out with some quests here and there. I’m level 53 &amp; helping people is probably one of the best things you could do in this game.
---
"they can use PA, just as long as it's the 2nd worst stat wise and, to some, ugliest in the game."
---
you know that thing where you are saying the quests seem like typical fallout quests? be aware that 5 hours in you may easily be a 3rd or more through the entire questline. 
---
See, the problem is, you don't even know you are toxic.
---
The only thing they have nerfed is the two shot legendary effect and the explosive perk. What else did they nerf? They just beefed up big guns like they should have and if I recall they beefed up automatic guns early on. Also they beefed up laser and plasma guns.
---
I didn't understand that part either.
---
Good news, this to me reinforces the opinion that theres gonna be another FO76 push at this years E3
---
No one took any video or screenshots tho? 
---
I'll pop on again tonight - and see what I have on Xbox and PS4. 
---
Scorchbeast drop bos mod plans. 
---
Please enlighten me then.
---
Which is all fine, but less than a 1% chance for half of the masks in a week long timed event is stupid. If you don't have time to play the event, yeah, you probably won't get them. If you play the event 50 times and don't get a single one, if you initiate at least twice that number of trades after the event and don't see a single one in anyone's inventory, if barely three people on this entire subreddit comes forward showing that they got one, something is fucking wrong. 
---
Depends on your character build, mutations, and weapon. I just leveled a new character on my alt account, and even without all of my damage perk cards I was owning the SBQ at level 45 with a bloody .50 cal Machine Gun. If you have enough damage, everything but the SBQ becomes trivial. With all the nerfs, getting to that level of damage output while still remaining tanky enough to take a hit or two has become challenging, but it's doable. 
---
You don't need nividia experience, just launch the game directly outside the launcher
---
Fallout 76 players I hate:
---
The ones that constantly complain about how other people choose to enjoy the game.
---
Dude. Spoilers, man. 
---
SPOILERS... geez man.
---
Hey, I'm on PC but I'd love to join in! I'd love a discord link please!
---
It’s because Bethesda likes to retrofit all of their old shit to save money like the Russians do. The fact of the matter is that FO76 runs on a 10+ year old engine, and it really shows when compared to recent releases. Even their patch methods are old and tired which is why we are getting the drip feed of fixes that we are getting. Most games now have server settings that can be tweaked on the dev side, where patches can be made to the server without needing to change the client - Bethesda lacks similar flexibility. 
---
It gets here when it gets here
---
Oh no. The screws and said junk were in the stashbox, it just took all that I had in the stashbox. I'm constantly modding my and my team's weapons so I'm usually in short supply or looking for them. I had some newly found level twenty weapons I wanted that junk for. Regardless, I'm never autologging anywhere but C.A.M.P now. That's the lesson I learned. Just spend the caps on the fast travel. 
---
They have to make melee good because it's so incredibly boring to play.  If it wasn't somehow perceived as being better than everything else then no one would touch it.  
---
Personally I think it's much less good than everyone seems to think, but melee players can be handy in the sbq fight.  So bless them and their boring builds. 
---
So I should run around nude? Got it. Thanks
---
I would rather just see legendaries as a concept removed from the game and exchange them with hard to craft weapon mods that are less nonsensical.
---
Thats just an upside down 6. All good lol
---
I can't login either... PC
---
thats fine.
---
Well, it's more because their authentication servers are swamped with a ton of people logging in. 
---
Also, unfortunately, Morrowind only came out on Xbox and PC, and it's not even available on Xbone, so it's PC only. On the upside, the game is so old just about any PC today should run it. 
---
Helvetia must be the closest to Flatwoods and vault 76 you could land a nuke?
---
So I should run around nude?
---
Yes, I do. Otherwise what's the point? Otherwise where's the fun? 
---
incredible!
---
&gt;Probably not but why should you?
---
Well, I'd understand that this kind of shot was made without VATS. It wouldn't bother me, it would been one hell of a shot, but because it is done by VATS, that is basically like playing with aimbot, it is really bothersome. If this actually is that strong, there is no strategical counter to it, you just die and you don't die because he made great shot. You died, because game basically asked:"Hey, do you want his player to be dead?" and he just pressed "yes".
---
&gt; you can easily fight fire with fire 
---
There is not much of a fighting. You both sit and hide in chameleon and wait till one moves. One who moves first into others killzone is automatically dead.
---
do you not have regular armor?
---
That makes no canonical sense...
---
Bring your son. I'll talk to him
---
Because they know it's wise to hit economies first of their enemies.
---
Sometimes I like to go to low level areas and help struggling players. Sometimes they get in over their head because they don't know the spawns like we do. I don't take over, but I will step in and save them or revive them. It gets boring sometimes, and as a recovering addict being nice is the only high I have left.
---
\#5... locked doors keep the Super Mutants out. 
---
Your aneurysm or the update?
---
The Poll counted 751 people, with a total of 9,308 runs. Now if you want to argue that the sample size is too small for your liking then thats fine. But to say thats not how statistics works at all is you just attempting to minipulate people, like how you said it was only 200 people or when you use the word "conjure" in place of using math.
---
Maybe they’re gonna release a story mode for the overseer
---
Yeah, did you read my other reply to this post also? 
---
I like it. Either this, or just allowing us to scrap legendaries to learn their effects and gain some kind of "legendary mutation dust" that can be used in large quantities to craft legendary versions of items. 
---
It does me no good when I'm in PA
---
To be fair, would that be a bad thing for the long term longevity of the game, especially with the atom shop system in place to make non-sales revenue?
---
you dont need PA though
---
I've tried bringing this up in threads as well. Clearly points towards some kind of unknown balancing and yeah it feels like everyone hasn't noticed it.
---
Nope. Many have speculated that if it was released on Steam in its broken state Valve would have given players a refund no questions asked.
---
Thanks it was a pain to launch it. I did it by myself at level 39 so there was a lot of dying to get it done. 
---
I’ll do that! Where to get chef hat?) and maybe someone have rolling pin recipe?
---
Says nothing about stopping a vats crit from 1 shotting you or anyone. 
---
Ohh you’re the type of dude that needs to run with a squad nice, I’m the type of dude that wrecks full squads by himself, nice to meet you.
---
they stay when you log off, they seem to walk back to your camp so i'd imagine when you log off they disappear even if they hadn't made it to camp yet. and they don't do much, they walk around and will technically defend it if it gets attacked. 
---
I think that's why it was a big deal at the time, pleasant surprise.
---
It they truly are changing the drop rates today I'm going to laugh my ass off if they drop at twice or three times the rate as the common ones did. since everyone was complaining that would just be funny on their part. 
---
Yes, I do.
---
Otherwise what's the point? Otherwise where's the fun in any of it? 
---
You might say there's some feeling of accomplishment if to finally get one, I see that used a lot. Not really. It's more a feeling of "Well about fucking time, now I can stop doing this dumb shit all day, that was so stupid." 
---
Great the only game I own outside of steam, bought two copies and now the make the move to Steam. I wonder if they will allow us to transfer accounts. Most likely not.
---
Yeah it's absurd I'm pointing it out to two different people in two different threads right now as well as all week since the announcement lol
---
I wish there were some way to decline a requested item.
---
Ill still wait until it has private servers.
---
I'd like it if 3-star enemies always dropped 3-star legendaries and 2-stars always dropped 2-stars. I think I'd be happy with that adjustment.
---
(Also would like to be able to inspect legendaries in vendor windows again if that hasn't been fixed yet.)
---
that's an awesome helmet though, makes him look like Dr. Doom.
---
I'm certain you do :) 
---
You are right. I am a commo operator. But my ideas not bad and it's up to the community and eventually Bethesda.
---
Bethesda is not giving steam 20-25% if sales revenue unless they need the additional player base and are willing to let that profit go to steam in return for increase sales in the atom store.
---
Of course the server is full, its only 24 players.
---
Capitalizing on Obsidian's oopsie I see
---
Still gonna get killed in one hit
---
Bloodied users we're able to double the damage bonus somehow. That was fixed.
---
Also vats and critical hits we're changed where automatic rifle/pistol users no longer got the damage and accuracy bonus on each consecutive shot. They said they fixed a separate exploit out of vats, but that also effected vats automatic criticals.
---
Vats builds in general were nerfed as you can no longer target a crouched player ever. Previously you had to shoot them once for five free seconds of vats time. No more. Crouch and the enemy will never be able to critical hit you. Have fun with those crouched sentinel users now...
---
Ye I did the same but had to change so I only store weapons 3*. ’Fallout: Over encumbered’was not that fun of a game.
---
This.
---
I hated the Raider roleplayers at first, but now I love them. While I'm definitely more of a Responder/Brotherhood hybrid, I do enjoy the dynamic that we as players have created. We have made a "story" of our own and it is beautiful. Bethesda let us make the game world ourselves. Responders, Raiders, Brotherhood, Enclave, Free States, lone wolves, shiners, crafters, traders. I actually prefer this fallout to any other, especially now that the servers are finally starting to fill up.
---
Where does it say that you cannot accept an item in trade or pick up an item in game?  He did not use any sort of exploit.  That is what is against the rules!
---
Ahh i see. It didnt make sense before, but now it's all clear. You're a bitch.
---
Thou shit talking aside, vats crits and high damage builds (probably bloodied also) will probably be affected the most.  I imagine they are going to cap damage somehow...we will have to see.
---
I had my camp set up on a junk pile near there.  Had to turn the jukebox on to drown out the screaming.
---
but they like to probe your booty
---
That's really would be. It's scuffed that they have to fix it a couple hours before the event ends
---
There was no "last week's patch".  Fasnacht was already in Patch 7 .. it was just activated last Tuesday. I'm assuming Survival Mode is also in Patch 7 (as well as the Burrows and other underground locations) and just have to be activated, since the patch was 14+ GB....
---
On Xbox, I'm getting kicked out of the server just after the loading screen. Says disconnected from server. And I can't access the Atom Store. 
---
Didn’t know about the crouching. And the marsupial thing is a timing thing. I’ve seen people clearly airborne and still get hit. Granted that’s a sever issue. 
---
By all rights, everyone who bought it should get a Steam key, but that'd be lost sales for BGS, so nope.
---
I'd love to see some attention given to the M79. I've got one that's Instigating, it's a real riot to use, but it probably could benefit from more interaction with Fallout's weapon modding system.
---
What I want to know is this:
---
Players who close the trade and then reinitiate it several times. What the hell are you doing? How are you screwing this up so badly? 
---
I’ve gotten the same bug in PS4. It even pings sometimes when the caps stash isn’t present at all. 
---
Weirdest location is the caps stash between Charleston FD and Riverside Manor (wrecked house, second floor, top bunk bed) that seems to have disappeared entirely last week but still pings.
---
Most of the responder bots have the rolling pin plan and chefs hats is in most restaurants. 
---
Based on what? What if they normalize damage or cap damage so it can't exceed 200 or some crazy shit.  We really have no idea.  I'm  guessing bloodied and vats crit builds will be hit the hardest in survival beta or at least within the first week of balancing lol
---
I believe you're correct. The whole quest revolves around crafting a full set of Excavator PA, so the plans should be obtained at the beginning of quest.
---
No, it won't, because I'm not going to join your silly little mode. 😂
---
Ok then, starting in 1 hour 
---
Lesson #2
---
GTFO of nuke area 
---
Leason #2A
---
Always have a rad suit or PA on you 
---
Not trying to be critical; the same thing happened to me about lvl 25 at Whitesprings.  I logged in (nuke zone already in effect) and died like 6 times in a row 
---
Nice! I'm sure that made somebody's day. I've been hitting the jackpot too this week as far as finding plans I've been looking for forever. I couldn't find them with any vendor, human or robot, and then this week I just found them laying around in paper bags at train stations. 
---
Been a problem since beta, I have 2 xboxes, one has a friends list, one doesn't. One can connect and one can't. This sounds stupid but works, reset your main router, the game gets confused with servers/ip's or something. Then try connect via the xbox menu. This is a trick for multiple xboxes in the same house, but works even if you not. Invite is probably not on the fix list.
---
Also if there were enemies close by it won't let you send an invite. Sometimes both of you need to reset your routers and try a new server.
---
Bloodied build was also reduced massively, rads seem to do more damage now. Radshield does not allow you to keep your mutations, they took away explosive from certain weapons. Again I'm not saying it's all recent just that there seems to be a trend of making things less than they were rather than improving on what exists. It's a computer game, it feels like if something is good or desirable than we will take it away/reduce it/make it impossible to get in the first place. 
---
The new PvP mode has new weapons but they aren't anything special... why not? Make them something that everyone wants or if there is a build that stands out make something to counter it. People moan constantly about duped weapons and how anyone higher level must have cheated or bought it all off Ebay. Bring out some weapons that make those that were duped undesirable. That aren't a 1 in a billion drop or make it so that you can grind for them. Don't go the other way and take stuff away from the game.
---
I am super addicted too. Also all these updates are SO GOOD that its hard to not be invested. 
---
Vot iz your name? You are also going on ze list!
---
You're literally grinding an event non stop... to get a mask. Nobody is holding a gun to your head. If it's stupid... if you feel it's stupid... then don't do it.
---
At that point, it's not a game any more. It's work. Why is this mask so important? 
---
Like I said... for the third time. Agree to disagree. Nothing I say is going to change your mind. I like it the way it is. I like that the dude who can't play the game nonstop has an equal chance, with each run, to get a rare mask. That's the way it should be, to me. 
---
I still don't have the skin I want in Overwatch, despite near 200 levels and 100s of hours of play. Oh well. By your logic, I should. 
---
every run of the parade is a lottery ticket, with an equal chance fore everyone, for every run. 100 runs, or 1... still 0.03% (or whatever it is). As it should be. 
---
This I actually agree with. There is one "friend" of mine in particular that tried to come get me to build the walls for his shack because he didn't have enough wood. Wood. WOOD. 
---
So because I only feel like using one set of armor, I'm now a bitch? 
---
Oh, my self esteem has plummeted because some rando on Reddit insulted me. You've won. All of my arguments are now invalid cause you said a swear.
---
You feel good about yourself now?
---
Start over or spend levels. There is no other way.
---
The fact that you see nothing wrong with what your kid did is disturbing, good riddance to him.
---
Unless they designed the bunker very smartly to allow the door without the trick.
---
Someone probably 1 shot killed it. 
---
Might be a good idea to save your level ups until then so you can respec if necessary.
---
I've been redoing perk points all weekend for survival lol

Just a heads up, tagging more than three people sets off the spam filter and doesn't send out any notifications.

I've been rocking either the civil war suit with bowler hat or hunters long coat with welding goggles and confederate kepi.
---
People are still doubtful. Someone will find a way to still one hit and it’ll spread and add more fire.  BGS needs to show this new reduced one hit wonder in action and  not tell. 
---
Well, you would still have to meet the requirements to even have a weapon capable of being legendary, so I wouldn't say this is easy at all, it's just less frustratingly random. You might have to do a lot to unlock a legendary weapon, but at least you could see progress towards your goal.
---
Yeah very true. I should start stockpiling some now.
---
I've got an assassin 2-star that does extra limb damage, and it's fun. But I'd l8ve an instigating one and some better mods.
---
Or at least get a grenade arc. Currently, grenades and molitovs are my go-to for softening up a tightly bunched group of mobs, but I'd love to get more precision withthe launcher.
---
Let the slaughter commence &gt;:D
---
So set up steam to launch the .exe file
---
I never said I saw nothing wrong with it.  I actually said exactly opposite.  What I did say is Bethesda's response is completely lacking.
---
I also want to know the answer to this
---
I think having people running around as different "factions" adds to the depth of the game. I love seeing Responders, Brotherhood, and Raider roleplayers. It makes me smile. Hell, we even have some die-hard FO4 fans that roleplay the Minutemen.
---
I've actually been thinking about roleplaying Caesar. He started out east, and this would be about the time frame the first one rose to power.
---
OH SHIT I forgot about survival mode! So excited :)
---
Lost all my junk because of their shitty servers crashing. 
---
Which is crazy, because I was still alive when they crashed. 
---
Nice! 
---
Damn that's sucks thanks for reply 
---
Yeah I'm sure it will take a lot of balancing.  That's probably why they are doing a beta (suprised they are doing a beta for anything in this game lol well maybe they learned their lesson)
---
They are the best non rocket turrets
---
Well it must be a miracle if a game of this scale launches without no hiccups so it must have been expected but people kind of blew out the bubble into this constant thing and it sucks to be honest. It definetely is causing people to reconsider before buying.
---
And happy days for you the Fasnacht event is ending tomorrow and i don't even know whet it is happening lol
---
Just go to Whitesprings and take down the 3-4 sentry bots that are roaming around.  Their fusion cores are almost always 50% or better. 
---
sry cant send you msg via pa4 and looks like you have audio turned off in game
---
Sick use of the archway, love it when people use preexisting assets as part of the camp.
---
If I could make a suggestion, use the coloured lights set to red so the glow comes out through the windows so it's like the eyes of a Stalking Mothman. Purple would look tight as well but I reckon red would set a nice contrast, whilst making it look a little sinister. 
---
I had this a couple hours ago. Error 3:0:7 or something. It was down for about an hour and is working fine now

---
Well yeah, but unfortunately I don't see that happening. So if legendary items stay a thing, let's at least take away the frustrating RNG side to getting them.
---
PvP being optional is part of the game mechanics, yes.  But it is deliberately limited because it is not the heart of the game.
---
The game is clearly designed to be co-op, and the whole plotline is about that.  Multiplayer =/= PvP.  You seem confused.
---
People who WANT PvP are getting the game changed for them... it's called survival mode.  And have fun with it!  I am all for people having their fun.
---
Agreed group dynamics will be paramount!
---
The junk mode where the highway and railroad meet?
---
I used to rock the bathrobe and top hat.
---
Now it's the straight jacket, tin foil hat and prisoner collar
---
The trade thing disconnects randomly. They probably aren’t do anything. 
---
Of course everyone should have the same chance, but the current rate is fucking dumb when basically nobody on the entire internet has a single one on the second to last day. One should be like 1%, and the others maybe 5%. Whatever it's set to now wasn't a good idea, or something is just broken because again, nobody has one. 
---
&gt;Bethesda is not giving steam 20-25% if sales revenue unless they need the additional player base...
---
Hm, and I guess that's why they're releasing all of their (mostly) single player games (RAGE 2, the new Wolfenstein's, DOOM Eternal) on Steam, too - because they need the additional player base in games that haven't yet been released?
---
I managed to log on to the website but the code for the free Morrowing doesn't work. Gives an error. Hope they get it fixed soon. 
---
I’m sorry if I sound aggressive man, but why in the hell would you want them to put it in the game that way? Why not make it a plan or part of a quest instead of something tied behind using real-world currency or challenge grinding that is more immersive breaking? 
---
Same here 😂, all those carry weight reductions legendary perks pay off
---
i mostly avoid honey beasts.  had a bad run in with a couple when i was a low lvl player.  Still stings me to this day.
---
Well yeah if it is actually true, but who knows what they actually did and so far they haven't shown much of a reliability, when it comes to thinking ahead. It is very possible, that something like "VATS 1 hit kill build" has been over sighted, because they were focused on figuring out how to remove spam healing.
---
Okay, so am I missing something? My weapon feels more deadly during pvp but I am no longer able to 1 shot people? Doesn't that mean that my weapon's less-deadly now? 
---
I'm on the opposite end of your spectrum, essentially no caps but a boat load of interesting-ish odds and ends across a few characters, haha. 
---
I'll check my plan mule later tonight, road trip today but will be active tomorrow, I'll see if I can whip up something interesting enough to feel like a good trade!
---
Maybe they need to cap pvp damage so that it’s more in line with the health a player can achieve. If you can get a switch blade up to 400 damage against a 250 health player what’s the point. Same for guns. Sure they can still one hit. But the damage doesn’t go on for ever with all the perks boosting it. 
---
Against mobs keep it at what it’s at. You didn’t hit That 3* Star oh well. 
---
You have been awarded 50 internet points 
---
&gt;Why do I feel like there’s more ranks coming to knight paints? And also will we get more things like maybe something called lieutenant? Or other military ranks?
---
i know about BOS Sentinel paint, but its not in game
---
I got improved reliability replacing my heavy machinegun with a heavy laser. (The heavy machinegun was ignoring some enemeies.)
---
Ev'rybody Danse now!
---
Yeah I gave it a go, same thing.....im beginning to think Bethesda is producing bugs in everything they do anymore.
---
When’s the release date !!!!
---
Probably mistaken use of the Cancel button trying to "back out" of various selections when trading.  I have been known to accidentally cancel a menu or selection and pop out of trade with my teammates by mistake.
---
Are you sure about that? May be if you only do main quests but i side track a lot and have a large list of side quests stock piled which definetely will take more than 5 hours to complete. Even if the main story is short who cares its about the world around it and the real good stuff is in the side quests (Nukashine is really cool in my opinion)
---
no. literally on the overpass that goes over the highway. close though
---
Get marsupial, some teammates, and strange in numbers. Last queen fight I joined, I was jumping and hitting her in the air like a crazy person.
---
Yeah the terminal at Garrahan HQ gives the plans at the beginning of the quest. 
---
I hope so badly they improve the camp budget again
---
&gt; u/ladydevann  u/Valseek  u/jessBethesda  
---
Ah good shout
---
Mid trade? Idk. But if its as soon as they accept, if they have multiple of whatevers on top then itll initiate trade request for that (bring up the number slider) and sometimes when you try to back out, itll glitch and quit the whole trade.
---
Here’s to hoping. 
---
Maybe enough people cried out. 
---
THIS TOO!!  +100
---
I've noticed since the last BIG patch that if I dont trade within like 20 seconds of trading with someone that it just drops the trade. My friends and I have all been noticing this, I'm assuming it has some connection to the upcoming player vendor thing. So they arent exiting on purpose and probably are also wondering why you're exiting and trying to trade again. 
---
so how much coffee did you go through to get there? ;P
---
You say "nobody", but you don't actually know that. Maybe "nobody on reddit has said they have one" but how many installed games out there? How many players? 
---
Using absolute terms like "nobody" puts the burden of proof on you. 
---
and, IF "nobody" has one... so be it. Lottery prizes don't get won every week. If "nobody" got a specific mask this go-round, they'll adjust the drop rate for the next event. *shrug*
---
We have fundamentally different thoughts about gaming, we're not going to see eye to eye, man. It's all good. 
---
I know I do it sometimes because I forget that the "back" button actually closes the trade when what I really needed to do was change the filter from offers only to everything
---
I'm online and audio is now on
---
Agreed, 50 caps a core sounds much more reasonable, but like I said, I'm open to negotiation.
---
Damn, I'm good. No your ideas aren't bad at all. In fact the only thing I want more than a bunker is the Noir Penthouse from FO4. I could tell by the way you phrased some things that you weren't a grunt. Also it wasn't written in crayon and most of the words were spelled correctly. 
---
Is the batt robe an atomic shop item or is it in game?
---
cool. im gonna buy some condoms for when my mom goes fooling around with the other gamers on the enemy team.
---
You have to level up another 100 times and change 1 point each level 
---
No, you don’t.
---
I found him at the random encounter right next to Fissure Prime, during a nuke... dude is hella committed to making a sale. 
---
...nope, you just failed to not be that guy.
---
In game. I believe I bought it in whitesprings 
---
The free drinks are to loosen your wallet. 
---
In this case the Fasnacht equivalent of "free drinks" are "common and less rare masks".
---
Yeah me too. But judging how they added more ranks to this game then F04 I assume they’re going to add more.
---
There is one in the whitesprings bunker, its to the left of the main door on the lower area under the walkway, you need 7 intelligence to activate a destroyed assaltron. It says some pretty interesting stuff.
---
I’m roleplaying as a shopkeeper, and I couldn’t tell you how many times this has happened. It’s constantly, and very annoying. The trading mechanics need to be explained a lot better, it seems so confusing for folks at lower levels  
---
It’s also very fun for people that enjoy watching players choke on their Doritos with rage over “not having all the things.”
---
You being hit is likely from the blitz lock on. Without that, you would leap right over them. They would have to meet you in the air or time your landing. Still, it should buy enough time to survive that first instant kill.
---
I'm starting to think that your "son" is actually you...
---
It's not an outfit, but I've been liking my [Marine Armor with BoS Combat Armor Helmet, Surgical Mask, and Welding Goggles!](https://imgur.com/a/IlFhlTk)
---
Yup, it's a non-power armour dudes that I'm wary of. PA bros are fine, no threat to anyone :) 
---
Also, whats up with the people who set an item to 0 caps just to undo it a second later and before I could accept. Then they do it like 100 times in a row so you have to hammer the accept button to make the trade. Why??
---
All that hate'll burn you up, friend  
---
\- #1 and #5 
---
Isn't all the data about your inventory stored on a server though?
---
This would be a brilliant arrangement for legendaries and rare plans at all events.  Too much of this game is too grindy and repetitive, and it would be nice to be able to dedicate more time to exploring and adventuring with friends.
---
Wow! Really nice details and inventive use of the half walls. Thank you for sharing such a cool creation :)
---
I've got a fever... and the only cure... is more Moth.
---
I also got attacked by 3 scorched Wendigos
---
Its bad business, but they're a company trying to churr a profit so they do what is most profitable and in this case this is the most profitable for them even if it is super shit for us users. I forgot to mention i had to wait 4 hours for my game to download because the client decided to only use 10% Bandwithd (not sure why), but this is less the actual game more the shitty client. About the patches i don't really have an opinion of them i've only played for 2 days. I guess when survival mode drops it will be a nice test from them to me 
---
Obsidian can tell a story but can handle money. They had to sell the fallout franchise to keep afloat. They need epic money to get to a better place in the industry.
---
Sick I’ll have to check it out!
---
Oohh nice! 
---
Sorry, just letting the place air out after using the toilet.
---
Reactive plates is a pleasant surprise to those annoying tools that want to mess with you. 
---
Was at Whitesprings last weekend minding my own business farming ghouls when all of a sudden some slappy starts hitting me with what I think was a Deathclaw Gauntlet.  Of course the guy was also dressed in a clown outfit and with a skull and crossbones mask.  Anyway, I turn around to see what’s up and there he is - lying on the ground deader than a doornail.   Seems to me he must have gotten a taste of his own medicine thanks to reactive plates.  Even better, I have unstable isotope and electrically charged muts.   Enjoy dickweed!  
---
Really enjoying my look with the winter jacket jeans, blue bandana and the American trucker cap.
---
They are not doing anything. My wife and I play, so I get the benefit of seeing both ends. As soon as she lets go of square it cancels the trade. When we trade now she has to hold square throughout the entire exchange, or it backs out of the trading screen. 
---
Where’d you get the helmet?
---
I would love the ability to scrap legendary weapons to learn that prefix for that exact weapon. so if i scrap a junkie's flamer i learn junkies for the flamer. if i had a 2 star Junkie's flamer with crippling i would learn both crippling and junkies for said flamer as 2 separate
---
crafting a prefix could require a high amount of resources of stuff, each star would need more and you could only add a secondary and 3rd if the last prefix has been chosen. 
---
say for instance the cost to craft a learned legendary effect could be 
---
1 star - 10K caps, 3 of each stable flux, and the weapon's repair cost
---
2 star - 7K caps, 2 of each stable flux, and the weapon's repair cost 
---
3 star - 5K caps, 1 of each stable flux, and the weapon's repair cost
---
so total to craft a custom combo of legendary prefixes you would need 22K caps 6 of each flux, and 3 times the base repair cost of each item added
---
i feel this way it would still be special to find a good legendary weapon. you could keep and use it for yourself, but you can learn how to craft them yourself and attempt to create a weapon you would enjoy much more. perhaps they could limit them being trade-able for a limited time after their modification or creation 
---
T Shirt and Slacks. ;)
---
Marine wet suit, full marine armor, then doing the headless glitch and putting on the assaultron helmet. Now I get a weapon out and put it away again to make the front of the helmet open up. With the headless glitch, this looks so funny. It looks normal from behind, but look at my guy from the front and you can see right through his helmet
---
I would say some of them are raiders.  A lot more are wannabees that just annoy the shit out of you.  
---
It's a paint job for the Combat Armor Helmet; if I recall correctly you can get it from scrapping the helmets. There are a few others as well!
---
Fashnat Man/toothy man + Straight Jacket + Drill/Pitchfork
---
Witch Costume + Grognack Axe
---
Civil War dress + Gatlin Gun
---
Synth = NPC
---
Idk why I got downvoted for saying that lmao
---
There's a hidden area is watoga that lets you inside a building. Which using marsupial lets you get to an inaccessible sky bridge that leads to a building filled with water.
---
Yes I get bored easily
---
I've had this issue teaming up with my friends. It usually resolves if you close 76 and restart your PS4
---
Cap dmg? What are you smoking man, and if that’s what they do I’ll ask them the same. 
---
Honestly I wouldn’t be against the vats crit guaranteed hit through walls 1 shotting all being removed, it’s a bit game breaking, or a lot game breaking.
---
But they better not f with my bloodied dmg, it’s not like how op Tse was before the nerf with super high reward and no risk, I have to run around at 20% hp, the risk justifies the reward.
---
That is awesome.
---
Well shit. I've got them, I just cant figure out how to place or use them. Very limited choices, and no straight or curved pieces. This kinda sucks 
---
Same problem here. PS4 / Germany
---
Dont know how to team up. Nothing in the friendlist is working correctly.
---
You clearly aren’t grasping the fact that people don’t agree with you. Just because you grind the event still doesn’t mean you should have a better chance at receiving a rare item. Again that’s the whole point of rare...not everyone is entitled to or should get one. 
---
I do grasp the difference between a reward and a participation trophy, but if all you have to do to receive the rare reward is grind the event then it doesn’t make it rare it makes it a participation trophy. 
---
My friends and I are having this issue right now too. We tried this and sadly it did not work for us. :(
---
Lol yeah I'm not sure,  I can only guess somehow weak people get buffed up and strong people get debuffed. But I'm speculating just as much as anyone else.
---
They stated during the streaming that each mask was meant to happen at varying levels of success and suggested several bots die.  However I can't verify this as I can't get people not on voice to cooperate.    Our only chance is to nuke it before the event starts which deters people from coming.
---
Blood for the Blood God.
---
Cool suggestion, I'll have to play around with the lights and see what might work good.
---
I don't think most people are complaining about being killed just because they are in PVP from taking a workshop, I think more are complaining about being killed REPEATEDLY.  The simple solution to this is to give the player a choice upon death to abandon the workshop, which would end PVP (and protect their camp), or to attempt to continue to defend it, which would leave them in PVP (including possible destruction of their camp)
---
Hey man. Sorry I got a bit too salty here. I personally think this game had so much potential but duping's ruined it all. So when I see someone complaining about the bans over duped items I immediately jump to acting like an asshole. Hope your issue gets resolved
---
Same problem here. Just started today
---
Tomorrow!!!
---
Disable mods, restore your modded .ini file. New DLC will always break the game if you've used hack mods. 
---
My friend screenshoted another player wearing the jester.
---
The trade feature is pretty glitchy,  so be a little more understanding.
---
Resetting doesnt work unfortunately 
---
Unbelievable! I love me some Danse!
---
Well ESO also has official written documentation how one such addon should be written, meanwhile F76 has no official support to addons. It is just there, because it was copied from Fallout 4 and that game was singleplayer game, and now building addons in a way they did for fallout 4 could lead for major security flaws. If they had no time to figure out that textchat is needed or how TSE was going to be op af, there is no way they would had time to figure out how you can abuse the "creating addon" code to cheat. So it is much easier to write it into ToS, that this is not allowed, until they go through all possible scenarios you could abuse the mods.
---
I don't think that you are going to find much sympathy here. Most folks here are pretty ok with that particular mass swing of the banhammer, some of us wish that they had swung a little harder. Why isn't he on here pleading his case?
---
eh, i think we've heard enough on it. once again the sub is divided into two extremists that don't believe in middle ground. some idiot barks "THE ODDS ARE FINE" and another goes "WE SHOULD ALL GET MASKS FOR DOING 10." anything in the middle is usually perceived as an argument for the other side and is downvoted, and any productive discussion is usually buried in the comments of some random thread. instead we get "to the guy who xyz" posts hitting the front page, or some other lame ass cringe rant about gamers rising up.
---
honestly, this sub is trash. there are a handful of people who really put out quality stuff and stir great discussion, points, and constructive criticism among the community in a way that not only lets our voices be heard, but also finds an objective middle ground to have productive discussion. some of those people run data, do research, datamine. content like that should be the focus of this sub. Pokémon Go has a dedicated sub that is very strict on the content you can submit. the result is a tight-knit community focused on providing helpful information, while also doing research and presenting both raw and organized data in order to learn the game's mechanics and numbers. if this sub was like them, we would have had rare mask rates after 24 hours. we would have *actual evidence* of the mask dropping on the "event completed" screen within *hours.* if we didn't, the community would immediately sense something off and do additional research to confirm before ultimately rallying a message to the developer. we got a post like that, with the OP datamining the odds in the code. people rallied up to get Bethesda's attention onto a possible issue, and then all of a sudden, there is a counter post. its an emotional rant about how we should just be happy and appreciate the event, saying that, undoubtedly, those masks are out there (while simultaneously citing absolutely nothing. this was before we had any pictures). it overtakes the post featuring actual data and code, getting gilded just as much, and that was pretty much it. now people frequently post about the masks (from the extremes and median perspectives) with no comments or upvotes outside of toxic bullshit like calling people entitled. it blows my mind that at the very least people aren't advocating that we get more info from Bethesda on rates or if methods affect the drop. if they are as rare as they are believed to be, shouldn't we know that? instead of "maybe youll get one!" they should say "these things are rarer than fucking diamonds dude, good luck." why would anyone argue against that? who tf knows.
---
anyway man, i know you didn't ask for that, but this sub really irks me sometimes. 
---
tldr: i don't bother making discussion posts because they go nowhere here unless you're making an extremist statement based more on passion than fact.
---
the devil ried and failed
---
(Oh getting real edgelordy)
---
Capping damage will likely break most people's builds and make DPS king. 
---
Black powder weapons NEED to kill on the first hit otherwise they are useless. The long reload is a massive liability. One hit builds are easily countered by serendipity bloodied builds.  You shot me with ten billion damage? I dodged it. Bloodied builds are easily countered by automatic DPS builds.
---
 If my 1,800 damage sneak headshot critical black powder build does not kill in one hit, I see no point in bringing it to survival. My guess is they will increase range penalties for certain guns so you need to get closer to kill. My black powder pistol won't kill at maximum vats distance. I actually need to get fairly close.
---
I caught the bots dialogue on I'd say my 4th play-though of the event. When his tone changes from happy to like a mob mentality angry voice "Burn him Burn Him Burn Him Burn Him" I seriously crack up for some reason. 
---
Once you get calibrated shocks it goes the other way, so far as the weight goes. You certainly do move faster without it. And can be potentially much , much stronger without it. Power armor with mods cannot compare to good legendary armor. But with my shocks on my pa I can carry 320 on average. But most players without pa can do more dps. I play heavy guns , .50 cal and gatling gun, my damage comes from stabilized . It's an intelligence card, takes three points. While wearing power armor heavy guns gain stability and armor penetration. So pa is part of my build. It's definitely not for everyone tho. The strongest way to play is not pa. It's assassin / sentinel/ cavalier. Three claw meat hook with barbed wire , bloodied, iron fist , gladiator, incisor , martial artist, dodgy , serendipity, bloody mess, fire proof, class freak, strange in numbers. I do none of that. Just not my taste, I like shoot and boom. 
---
I would rather be able to name power armor chassis sets. I have like 6 and when i need 1 specific one i have to drop all of them to find it
---
This.  Reinstalling the game doesn't necessarily fix the Fallout76Custom.ini file
---
Its a great game ultimately.  I have thousands of hours in since the beta.  It breaks occasionally, but most of the oddball design decisions have been dealt with, its much more stable than it was, and it has that same feel.
---
The multi player has settled into what it is, which is as you describe. I run into people all the time, mostly really nice players, I give them stuff, they give me stuff, occasionally team up, but mostly its pretty passive.  I think the whole PVP thing was a serious put off in the beginning, I personally hated it.  But after nearly 5 months, the people remaining or coming into the game now are having fun.  
---
It worked fine for me yesterday, it just started to happen today. I'm starting to see a few other posts popping up about this so it seems we're not alone
---
I'm pretty sure you're talking about the missile silo hatch.  It opens when you launch a nuke.
---
I like the RNG element. Honestly I think they should drop less.
---
According to this they have some outage problems today. 
---
Sounds good man, looking forward to it!
---
I’m lvl 149 now and didn’t start playing until well into December.  Back then a lot of players could lvl up very easily due to glitches and dupes and now it’s much harder to do so.   
---
Anyone saying they can level 10+ times a day is either full of it or they ramped up before things got nerfed or fixed through patches (see TSE). 
---
I still think it’s ridiculous to see some You Tube video of a guy with a TSE pushing 1500 dmg.  Yeah that wasn’t a dupe lol.  
---
Awesome thanks!
---
&gt;I do grasp the difference between a reward and a participation trophy, but if all you have to do to receive the rare reward is grind the event then it doesn’t make it rare it makes it a participation trophy. 
---
this is hands down the most idiotic thing I've read today. thank you.
---
I changed my password for nothing. I just wanted a free Morrowind GOTY.
---
Hope it's resolved quickly.
---
oh stop.
---
I got disconnected twice so far today.
---
Piper was fun, but I ultimately went with the nurse.  The detective and old man by the sea had some of the best patter.  The hothead was fun at first, but didn't keep up the 'tude like Suzie Shotgun (Drood/Nightsend reference)

They are also offering the Morrowind GOTY

OP: Personal situation, I discovered a glitch.  (Dont ask.I wont tell. i dont want it patched.) 
---
TL;DR: Someone said OP base building sucks, so now they hate everyone else.
---
I still haven't found a rad suit....probably about time I did. 
---
I'm sure bloodied and vats crits will still be the most damage dealing builds but I do assume the "gap" will be lessoned.  The way it is balanced now  is for PvP that is pretty much entirely optional.  So I'm not suprised they would be changing it for survival.  Question is, how much. We won't know until we try it I guess lol
---
Because I asked my son not to post.  I know how toxic reddit can become.  While I hoped that would not be the case, apparently I was correct as my post here has turned out to be getting me downvotes extremely fast.
---
It takes less than 5 minutes to create a loadout. Swapping individual cards in-game is the real hassle. This mod actually *saves* a ton of time in the long run. You can switch entire builds in 4 keystrokes.
---
Sounds good me and a buddy are gonna launch some nukes. Do you have power armor or a hazmat suit yet?
---
Multilogging on the same ip will probs block you. 
---
Yes I think it has to do with the event glitching there
---
i ran that stupid event 400+ times and got none of the rare masks i was after , thoroughly pissed ... will be taking a break for awhile ...burnt myself out grinding that stupid parade ...now i dont even feel like playing the PVP shit tomorrow .... 
---
I don't know man, you may already have a majority of the quests that exist activated, this game is extremely light on content.

They are not required to unban the accounts. They personally choose to do it after they delete the duped items but they are 100% in their right to keep it banned.
---
Literally laughing, thanks! Gotta get some plates.  Had unstable isotope, but lost it.
---
"A Slappy"  &lt;- gonna use that
---
Not gonna lie here 
---
Well I'll gladly meet up with you pick it up!
---
i think everything is very unstable right now, they are having some kind of problem with the servers, even the atom shop :/
---
I've done it several times before.
---
I think he meant “always running at maximum threat level”. Probably mostly annoyed in the context of the parade, since you can do it just fine with level 10 shit, oneshotting everything (especially the legendary at the end) can make it less fun for low levels. 
---
Well, *I* appreciate the thought you and all the rest have put into it, even if that doesn't mean much😅.
---
Thanks at the very least for being able to see the forest instead of just the trees.
---
76 breaks conon plenty of times, like why are there nuka weapons in appalachia? Theyre supposed to be test weapons at the bunker in nuka world.
---
You bear a heavy sin-debt, but absolution can be yours for say 2000 caps.  It only goes higher as the number and depth of your sins grow, such a deal, get redeemed now!
---
Would you consider that a viable tactic for using Unarmed against the Scorchbeast Queen, so long as she isn't in a Nuke Zone?  She kicks out so many Rads these days that I can't even get close to her without Power Armor now.
---
I do not. I am only level 8. 
---
I'm seriously getting it every time. Are you doing the event? Seems to be every time I do that it happens...
---
Id agree with you if not for the fact Bethesda has stated they'll unban his account and they indicate that while he obtained duped items through trade they never stated or implied that he actually duped himself.
---
400+times and nothing...fuck bethesda and this shitty troll parade ....
---
I wonder if there’s an unseen penalty for being naked with no armor. Doesn’t seem likely but the fact you did more damage than listed is really strange.
---
Dark souls 3 has this but the game showed you the penalty on the stat screen. On the off chance this is what’s happening here, it’d be nice if the game told us that.
---
Also it would be the final nail in the coffin on a beserker’s build. Not that it was very viable or advantageous to begin with, but still.
---
Made or not, he steals other players. Almost every day you read about new cases. Although he is on the blacklist but actually he is banned for life
---
I appreciate it.  I really think that Bethesda should reconsider how they are reacting to things.  They need to fix it but unfortunately the damage has already been done.  I really feel my son learned a lesson an I realize there may be nothing that will be done and his ban may remain permanent since there will likely always be dupes.  I have never known an online game not to have them.  
---
My son plays on Xbox and I am on PC.  If I had a second PC, I would just end up getting another copy of the game for him and fast level him to get him back up closer to where he was on xbox.  
---
I'm still hoping something will be done!
---
Just rebooted and now it says something about having trouble syncing my friends list.
---
Got that error this morning playing my main but since I wasn't mucking around with my Alt, it didn't bother me
---
Looooooads of times when I've been in the trade menu, I'll select the thing I want to sell and then at some point while setting the price, I'll suddenly be offering an item other than the one I was intending to sell. I think that's probably what's on the other end of the behaviour you're describing.
---
What patch?  There is no patch mentioned on the website...  PATCH 7 on March 13 contained (From my understanding) all content for WILD APPALACHIA ... starting with Nukashine on March 13, Fasnacht was simply activated on March 19 ...  we know that some people have seen the SURVIVAL MODE selection at main menu and others have been teleported into The Burrows (underground area) the past week or two.  I'm pretty sure all of this content is already in the game since Patch 7 and just needs to be activated.  "Hotfixes" may be implemented if needed to fix or address an issue, as they did almost 2 weeks ago
---
I'm adding what happened here into my role-play.   
---
The character I'm playing as *was* a well meaning vault dweller who honestly wanted to build a better tomorrow. As he emerged from the vault, he saw numerous horrors, things beyond his worst nightmares. Still he soldiered on, determined to succeed. After many adventures, the final straw was when a harmless little kitten wandered too close to his camp and was murdered by the very turrets he built to protect him. In that moment, the line between him and the monsters he fought was never so thin, and something inside of him broke. He saw how futile everything had become. That was when he became something different, something predatory. 
---
They couldn't even make it 76 atoms
---
[They've done it before](https://youtu.be/tKfWNTKwudY), quite well. I would totally go on a punga seed binge in the Mire...or a Sundew grove.
---
We don't know what they will do.  No sense arguing over out speculations.
---
I just want a Robobrain butler to welcome you to my C.A.M.P.
---
im still getting one shoted at my workshops from time to time but other than that the people is nice
---
We've got a sourpuss over here, folks.
---
Agreed, made me want to do a PC mod for it
---

Check the roof of Poseidon power plant. Usually one up there in one of the huts
---
But dupes have been patched!  Bethesda has it in the patch notes where 3 dupes have been patched since he was banned!  I have never known an online game NOT to have dupes.  I asked Beth to explain and have gotten nothing.
---
I'm only going off my past experiences. I don't work for Bethesda I don't know how to fix every problem with the game. 
---
Games fucked. Crymore. 
---
I’m 127 now and also have a weight issue so have never fast traveled and hit 6 vendors every play session so my loop takes about 3 hours and 3-4 cores just for that  baring any side tracking.  I’d love to have all the weight reduction perks loaded but it’s really not feasible if I wanna fight anything really at all.  It’s not uncommon to go thru 5 if I get hit in a bunch of scorch beast battles but yeah I may have to try and tweak my build to add it in if I can’t come up with a way to find cores.  I haven’t yet taken it and none of my packs had it drop.
---
I removed everything that doesn't spark joy and I'm still at goddamned 780.
---
No offense, but it gets really annoying when i just want to create a mule or an alt.
---
 He goes down more easily every time. I would pay to kill him as I have a deep hate for his fuzzy ass. The acid is welcome ;)
---
Wanna I don’t know maybe describe why that is or are you just going to attack me now? When you don’t have a coherent argument you just attack the poster is that it? 
---
Like I said if all you have to do in your eyes is grind the event to get a reward that is suppose to be rare then it doesn’t make it rare, because everyone will just grind the event to get the reward.  If you also think that just because you grind the event you should have a better chance at something then someone who doesn’t grind the event that is exactly what entitlement. You feel you are entitled to something because you have done it so many times. Clearly you don’t grasp any of that. Like I said people don’t agree with you. 
---
I just read your thread on your furious testing after I saw this comment. Interesting stuff. That’s the most in-depth I’ve seen anyone get. Whereas I’ve seen people throw 30% cap or 50% cap around in casual comments with no data to back it up. 
---
I totally believe you with the prime zealots thing. Sometimes all you need is the eye test. Perhaps if I find a prime receiver on my zealots Gatling plasma I’ll try it out. Though I probably won’t go out of my way to get one. 
---
They were probably thinking something along the lines of "let's make a fun way to track hours played, most people will find it amusing and not freak out."
---
I stick them in the cash register, but it is the same idea. I would like to recycle some though. I would love to convert the 100s of shotgun shells back to plastic, lead, and gunpowder. Plastic is the main one though.
---
That would be ok too, though you still have to RNG grind to learn the effect for your preferred weapon.
---
yeah, is show my main char as in the main menu when i try to join it, even if its in the game.
---
I wouldn't play at all before things get stable again :/
---
i've been trying to help out new players in small ways too - i like to craft full sets of modded level 1 leather armor and when i see a new player in the vault, i drop a bag outside with it and some stims/rad-x/radaway/water (not too much tho, don't need your intro the Appalachia to be over-encumbered immediately) it's fun and frankly it uses up some materials that are maxing my stash and i would like to get rid of. :)
---
It's inconsistent.
---
What I suspect is happening is that while the crippled wings force the Scorchbeast to land, it first has to find a valid position to land and get into position.  And depending on what else is going on, or other interrupts (like when you stagger it), it may take its sweet time getting there.  Flat surfaces seem to matter too.  I've never gotten the Scorchbeast to the south of Whitesprings to land on that sloped hill.  I always end up leading it to a flattened space.
---
Maybe, who knows.  Point is they have already announced they are doing something and everyone is acting like the announcement was never made lol.   They did however specifically mention being one shot will be less likely.   How they attain that? No idea.
---
The question says the easiest way. The easiest way is to do leader of the pack event when it pops up as it gives you the highest amount of low level legendary monsters, and they proc up the counter. The fastest way is to combine that with uranium fever and random legendary hunting in between. 
---
Survival Mode servers aren't up yet. So I guess the servers may go down to add that?
---
Yeah, I’m not discrediting a high price because I get it. But 10,000 is asinine 
---
I dont need excuses! Im allowed to be a bad guy!
---
NO GRIEFING THO! IVE NEVER GRIEFED!
---
Me too. It would be nice if we could somehow tame and domesticate kittens and rabbits, maybe even foxes and squirrels, and keep them inside our camp. I mean I have seen dog bowls in the game, so why not?
---
I double dog dare.
---
true, but there would be moderately less. say you find a main prefix you want on 1 piece of gear, and a secondary on another, scrap them both. build a new one and attach both prefixes to your new gear (after paying crafting cost)
---
There is something worth saying is that he could find anyone on the map if he's got no bounty and Chase people off.
---
They'd have no one on the server beside them to play, so I'm not sure what the point of that is. Theoretically possible though.
---
I think player vending is the answer. If your character has bad RNG, then instead of grinding legendaries all day you can farm caps and buy the weapon you want. I like your idea and I think they could incorporate some of it but I think we need to see how the Purveyor will work before we get too caught up in massive reworks like this. 
---
Is this some drug influenced raider poem? I want more
---
Suck a dong
---
Gotcha.
---
Honestly, unless it's costly to power them I'll probably use one all the time once I get one. They're just cool...   LOL! 
---
Tell me about it! A slow moving brainless ghoul they'll just chug along like, "Nope, nothing here to shoot", but a kitten? They turn into the T-800.
---
radaway doesn't take them away but suppress them for a little time, so the best is not using any...
---
also i remember some guys said that if they you use diluted radaway the mutations weren't suppressed but didn't test it since i don't have any
---
They’re actually all over the place if you know where to look. There’s a dead assaultron in the Enclave Bunker that has an Intelligence check 
---
I am Root

[This is how much of the map i've explored](https://imgur.com/a/yEYNz3x) I'd say that's like 10-15% so i highly doubt all the content ends there especially when i've seen youtube videos of quests far beyond where i am.
---
I thought it was a joke?
---
We’re coming for you 
---
I think he means running all that will in lowbie areas.  Places you can one shot punch an enemy into next week with a sideways glance.
---
I typically like to step out of my PA in these areas because it feels like overkill or grandstanding.
---
Commenter: TL;DR: Someone said OP base building sucks, so now they hate everyone else.
---
TL;DR: I think Im cool.
---
Yeah it seems to be what everyone is doing so they have always been gone when I went through lately.  I may have to start server hoping which they say causes stability issues but might be what I’ll need to do.
---
Supposedly its a 1/3333 chance drop
---
Maybe you should offer to buy them?
---
Ugh I hate that. You get the same XP, please let everyone get a shot in. No one gives a fuck that your Gauss Rifle can one shot a legend bro. 
---
Best part of the conversation were those two comments.
---
Knowing what platform you're on could prove very useful
---
He had no bounty, so I'm sure whomever else he and his teammate did that to did the same as my team. We bounced as soon as they started attacking. We had both waved as soon as they showed up, thinking they were just playing the game like most people are, and then they made their announcement and started attacking.
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
I side spec'd into shotguns as well, but only for a rank 3 Enforcer perk. Anything that gets too close gets its legs shot off. Which enables me to back up and drop them with my sniper rifle.
---
Hey, I'm with you.  Unless they turn around and find your son also had a hand in duping items, I think they should follow through on their word!
---
I fear you will consigned to the abyss of maggotty torments for eternity, but alas the choice is yours. Cheers!
---
I'm not ashamed to say I would buy it ftom the Atom Store.
---
I guess I will just die as I wait 5 seconds to reload my single shot gun...
---
No, you're fine. You're using that as the devs intended it. 
---
The regen rate with ghoulish is insane, but related to rads. The higher the rads, the more insane it gets. It is a balance between the rads incoming and rad resistances.
---
For best results, get a couple of Rad Sponges in the group and let the full rads hit you. Every blast will refill your health bar and rad sponge will keep the red out. We have two rad sponges in our regular group, so I drop the Rad Resistant perks and glory in the heals.
---
Correction: I AM cool :)
---
Not saying what you’re describing is not the case for you but it was always the item we agreed to trade in my case.
---
Id argue against being able to sell ammo to vendors. Ammo is one of the most common items in the game. If you could sell ammo then everyone would be getting caos a whole lot easier. You could just collect abunch of useless ammo and go to a vendor and thats easy money. Kinda take away the fun of finding a caps stash or a good item worth selling. 
---
[Sure.](https://i.imgur.com/9jamc5Z.png)
---
It reminds me of something James Cameron said when he was talking about his original plans for Alien 3. He said the Alien would not had been in Newt or the cat because, "*I'm not that f\*\*\*ing cruel!".* So see Bethesda, James Cameron even agrees it's wrong to kill a cat!
---
If they dropped better loot then no one would care. But they don’t, they drop garbage. 
---
Either one - there will be blood.
---
I’d go 20 a core for 520 caps
---
Oh my God I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. There are multiple posts with people freaking out. 
---
I put jump on O button (PS4), anything else feels wrong. For whatever reason, this changes the trade request also so I have to hold O to initiate, then release at just the right time or it closes the trade. Sorry, blame lazy button mapping?
---
I've got one. I should be on tonight. I'll send you a message with my GT.
---
I believe I have an extra one. GT etienne_henriot. I’ll hook you up tonight
---
Ps4, sorry
---
Screw Steam
---
Sorry. You have no idea how sad this made me. 
---
If you scroll over another item before setting the price or they buy an item it switches the line you have selected. Similar to trying to navigate the social menu.
---
I ate the mushroom underneath.  Is that bad?
---
What the fuck? You post a problem and I offered a reason why it might not work, you then say 'well I've done it before' to which I reply 'in that case sorry dude I don't know why' then you're toxic at
---

---
which system?

"I think I AM cool:)"

They're just an obstacle to avoid, and the fact they can hurt you inside multiple walls ...
---
As long as I can transfer my characters over without having to re-create an account
---
Pretty sure I’ve got an extra. GT etienne_henriot. I’ll be on tonight about 9ish cst
---
It is, but when you log into a game server, it's assumed, all your inventory is loaded from the storage sever into a single string table that houses all items on the game server. When loaded with too much information lags and crashes servers, hence the dupe glitches that used crashes to function. 
---
That's why there was such a low cap on stash storage, helped with server stability. So my thoughts for a good solution is to keep a large cross-character stash off the game servers. Would let players keep tons of items with little burden on game play.
---
I just want a response and explanation from Bethesda.  They are not giving it.  If they had actual proof that my son was duping then OK.  I would never say a word.  And he would be in big trouble with me for cheating.
---
They are just Skyrim dragons, but worse. Bethesda has a talent for making bad flying creatures, just look back at the SINGLE most hated Bethesda creation, the Cliffracer. I feel like Scorchbeasts are only a thing because someone really thought dragons were cool over at the home base, and wanted to add them to Fallout.
---
That's a big 10-4 good buddy. Will do! Thanks for intel!
---
Idk why but I saw them as clunky, bullet sponge „wink wink” bosses. They feel boring. I dont even do nukes zones anymore. Not for scorchbeast i guess 
---
Yah, if we could force them to land... that would be enough. Don't have to change the AI to make it land more often.
---
I mean, they have air superiority, they should use it.
---
In that case, that's a bit annoying. I think those people may need attention some times.
---
Also, not just on this sub, but in general I've seen a large amount of people forget what "entitled" really means.
---
I think it would be cool to say have a quest that has us find where Appalachia Radio is broadcasting from and we could find music archives that would add more songs to the station.  But I would be willing to pay 100 atoms for a new playlist. 
---
&gt;  if you're willing to run 1080p
---
Such hardships are beyond human endurance.
---
Indeed
---
Don't worry, I'm not the one balancing the game.  Don't have to convince me lol
---
Odd.

Thank you very much.

I hate cowards that delete their comments. Stand by your words, and take the downvotes like a man.

I think I'll orbital strike the next parade.

If I break in can I invite you over to my camp so you can meet my amazing cow MooMoo the 7th?

I bet once you hit the 7600 hrs it will give you 20 atoms and switch to 76000 hrs for 20 atoms. Just a fun little way to track your time played.

Thats very kind.

Bethesda has not announced any upcoming nerfs.
---
FO:NV did it!
---
Well, it's supposed to be a *beta* of survival, though I'm sure more than a few will forget that when it angers them tomorrow.
---
Yeah, and I think what some people are missing here is that at 50 bucks (how much my license cost me in Canada a week or two ago), that's deserving of an answer.  You already gave them your money.  You shouldn't be in the dark.  Either you should have received a time frame or they should have said it was permanent and why.
---
Weapons Workbench.  It'll be under the appropriate category ("Bladed Weapons", IIRC) and one of the listed "ingredients" is a Blade of Bastet.  When you select to craft it, like with most weapons, you'll get a level selection list for the level of blade to craft.  It starts at 25, and goes up at 35 and 45.
---
So should I keep my bloodied stuff?
---
Saw a guy yesterday with two of the fasnacht skull masks. I requested one of them cause I assumed he didn't need two, but I was apparently wrong since he quickly exited out of the trade and gave me a thumbs down and shot at me a few times. What a loser.
---
No, I didn't take any pictures or videos. I could have, but so far I've seen nothing but negativity and assholes on the photos that other people have been posting of someone with a rare mask
---
I saw a post
---
There has been nothing stated regarding any nerfs of any kind slated for tomorrow
---
I've been having problems with trading on PS4 where we get kicked from it without hitting any buttons. This might be what you're experiencing.

An opinion? Not a suggestion?
---
Sure
---
I love the way they fly away when they die. I have seen so much map and ran across strange places as the bodily blows away like a lose kite.
---
Although some are to clingy. I had one that kept following me after death. He appeared in so many strange places. I killed him in watoga and he followed me to harper's ferry. The little guy was just hanging out in the building.
---
So in short. The comic relief
---
It weighs nearly nothing so i keep it anyway. I Only ever drop mini nukes and missiles.
---
no I got it set so I can launch it via steam. I only use the beth launcher to update
---
I should also mention that you can do this with ALL the implements of the Mistress of Mystery, except for the Eye of Ra.  The Blade of Bastet, the Voice of Set, and the Garb of Mysteries.
---
You'll want to have at least 30 circuits if you go to launch a nuke.
---
Its not even the money.  Its the 200+ hours that he put into the game for the first 3 months.  Even if I got him another copy, I'm not sure he would play because of the time he lost.
---
Not interested but i want to fight some of you guys
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ it's the least i can do. i don't have time to play for long sessions/take folks under my wing. so i think back to my initial frustrations; damage, ammo, survival (hunger, thirst, stims).
---
Nah its not even worth your stash space.  Just hand it all over to me.  I'll take good care of it.  ;-)
---
I'd smash
---
I got insulted last time, but I am now on top of Cliffwatch. He followed me up here, but keeps telling me to wait, and does nothing. I am sad. I wanted to be insulted by a robot.
---
I know Rad-X suppresses mutations, but I've never had that issue with Radaway. I'll have to watch and see if I ever have that issue. I do tend to use diluted radaway before the full strength stuff and I almost never have a shortage of either. After gaining the ability to craft rad shield, I tend to sell off all of my rad-x rather than risk the mutation suppression.
---
If all it took was 40 times you can bet your ass A LOT of people would have those masks.

Portside pub in Morgantown should have 1

---
I always hold as much gunpowder, lead, and steel as I can for ammo. I suggest looking at the repair components for all your main weapons and armor and remember to always keep those specific materials. When it comes to other material, I only keep an upwards of 100 unless it is ballistic fiber, which I NEVER get rid of because it’s so valuable to me. Objects like gold, silver, and copper you shouldn’t keep too many of, maybe like 50 as they don’t have many uses. I don’t suggest keeping too much wood as it’s somewhat heavy for scrap and you don’t need it for really anything besides cooking once you have your camp finished.
---
Theres two places there. One you hope over a sign to get inside the building but my fav is a door that wasnt sealed :D its amazing to see the world without layers. You truely see the hard work.
---
If youre on ps4 I'll show you
---
You'd think if they really wanted to enforce this on mods they'd not allow an edited ini to load non-vanilla ba2 files. Seems more like wording the TOS in way to ban cheaters at will with no leagal recourse.

---
Real simple but i like the raider-ish look.
---
Thanks
---
Try looking around raider encampments, they spawn there occasionally and are somewhat reliable
---
It fun to climb to the top of a cliff and launch them off the side.
---
I thought so, too. Ended up being more experience for my team, since we had to clear the area again after server hopping. It was just annoying.
---
Depends on what your offering, I one shot people with my bloodied stuff so that's why I was asking if they are nerfing my stuff.
---
deal if you're on right now
---

you could scare some people

That's what I always do!

Rare ?
---
Especially with what Nukashine does, I can see that being possible... and fun!
---
They dont

I am highly sceptical of any attempts at rebalancing, this game os so in balanced it really needs an entirely different approach to fox pvp. I read this in the notes and have been extremely cautiously optimistic that they are at least trying.

And it’s Napoleon.

Check the bar right outside Bivs room. Train stations, outside are also a good source of beers and liquor. Vodkas the white bottle so theyre easier to notice.

---
lel
---
Like time line wise?
---
And about PWmoney we used to be able to sell it decently in f04
---
Sure, thing is, no one is arguing.
---
If I were you I'd start preparing him for the worst, depending on how much stuff Bethesda determines was illicitly earned he may already be losing progress when he's unbanned.
---
I would consider getting my first "wanted" status by slapping him to death...
---
Sometimes I just search the map for low-level players to see if they need anything. I know how hard it can be just starting out. Many that I run across are experienced players with a new character. I have been helped out and given things many times. It feels good to help out the ones that need it. Just yesterday at the Fastnacht event, a player told me he had just dropped a Dragon rifle. He led me to it. It was 200+ damage. I thanked him very much.
---
Given its 12 mask even a 5 percent would be cool , give yo do it 100 times ( I might be close to 50) you would be ensure to get something but to have half of the at a 0.03 was pretty lousy 
---
Sorry to hear that! They aren’t so awful once you’ve leveled up and worked on a more refined build. Definitely not as bullet spongey as Gulpers
---
Scrap it for Cloth.
---
Learn a Civil War Hat plan.
---
Make a hat for 1 cloth.
---
Sell it for 15 caps.
---
Oh well change that! I think I might have an extra. If not I’ll find one for you in a second
---
Yeah think it happens in fallout 2? That's like 200 years later
---
 I love them. They are so much fun and generate madness like nothing else.
---
 Hunting them is what I do. The more the merrier ... but some always run. ;(
---
Will try, thanks
---
You sir are bomb. Lol thanks.
---
If I recall correctly it's 16
---
The event also has a chance to award a leveled legendary item. I've gotten two. They should make events work like a team, so that loot is available regardless of who needed to kill the critter.
---
Shotgun! How much? Can I buy one on PC?
---
You genius you!
---
do you have a perk that reduces the weight of drinks? because those perks do not apply to stash.
---
Just finding vodka bottles around Al's, including the roof just now...  time to server hop.
---
I was kidding.  I have a bunch of bloodied weapons too.  I haven't heard of any incoming nerfs.  Some people are blaming bloodied builds for all their problems now and calling for nerfs, as though you couldn't possibly one shot most enemies without it.
---
Why don't you read your reply back and tell me again how sorry you were telling me to cry more.
---
Again - suck a dong 
---
OOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
PC but I can figure it out 😃
---
Don't waste it on things flying around... 
---
Can modded servers be far behind?
---
http://gamasutra.com/view/news/339311/Fallout_76_and_a_handful_of_upcoming_Bethesda_titles_now_headed_for_Steam.php
---
It's partial because only a part of the online services doesn't work: authetification servers. That means you can't get into the game because your credentials can't be verified, and not that a pat of players can get in, and another part can't
---
 Its worse, way worse ... its actually the best Fallout so far. ;)
---
They actually patched that specific part to be more stable in the last big patch believe it or not. So not only is it not a glitch, but they removed some of the glitchiness of the non glitch.
---
Wow, I didn't know that's how early in the timeline the game is. Thanks all!
---
I'm not sure if this was a suitcase you dropped in, but I was at one train station, and I happened to be terribly low on steel scrap.  At the time I was in the midst of a quest and very low on ammo and really not looking forward to a massive foraging trip to stock back up on steel before getting back to the quest.  I popped open a suitcase and found about 850 steel scrap!  It was the coolest thing I've yet found anywhere!  Thank you to the angel that left that for me!
---
Ahh yes, tru-hiker ***.
---
Makes sense now, thanks! :)
---
Wahhhhh I can't join my butt buddy on fallout and Bethesda should fix it for me RIGHT NOW. 
---
That's how you sound. Are you old enough to own this game or did mommy buy you it with your Good boy points? 
---
Haha that is not the reply I expected, I've heard many say it's the worse this far. 
---
I forgot to mention it also has an mirv launcher lmao
---
*OP states that people who judge other bases critically suck*
---
*Follows it up with how much OP thinks other people's bases suck*
---
*Fails to see the colossal irony*
---
Agreed 
---
I don't think bloodied needs a nerf because it makes everyone else's PVP build a one shot build against them.
---
I always let people go through my known plans or give them to low level players. Most plans are junk anyway.
---
Tired of the nerfing. Bloodied has the offset of running at &lt;20% health, that the masses of TSE meta bots did not have. They already fixed the nerf they made to Adrenal Reaction, I don't see them nerfing bloodied weapons.
---
Unless they're doing a mass damage nerf, removing vats teleports from melee, and a host of other issues that would just become the next meta.
---
Swimsuit, tinfoil hat and fashionable sunglasses. Something about running around post apocalypse in bare feet makes me feel badass. 
---
Psycho is a hellova drug.
---
I got the winter man mask but i needed cloth so i scrapped it.
---
Yeah that would be great maybe something like a free atom shop item of your choice.
---
&gt; Can you give the main points why most people don't like it?
---
It isn't Fallout 5 and it's online.
---
Human NPCs don't exist yet as the story is at a spot where everyone else is dead and you have to figure out why and fix that up.
---
Destroying camps
---
Found the only weirdo in existence who thinks shooting the same target for 5 minutes straight is at all enjoyable.
---
Fallout 76 is 25 yrs after bombs 
---
People didn’t read all the notes that said it is not FO 3 or FO 4 and hate all the things that are different. IMO. 
---
I hate having 5+ launchers on my computer, I like everything centralized on Steam. Why didn't they just do this in the first place?
---
I'd love to move it over to Steam but I doubt they'd do that.
---
At least it would encourage more people to buy the game, maybe.
---
Yes, I *appreciate* when they bother someone else, and leave me alone.
---
Im getting the vibe your needing alot of plastic. If you arent, then my bad. If you are, then not sure if anyone's told you, but if your looking for plastic, Morgantown or Watoga high schools are the usual ones. Any kind of children related place, all those toys have plastic as well.
---
Did anyone else read incest the first time around?  
---
It’s not great in my personal experience. But not bad either. It has some Fallout 4 elements. But a lot lesser than that. The map is bigger that’s good. But no npc’s only robots and no companions.. 
---
This is for when this game goes f2play on steam.  
---
It totally is a spoiler. 
---
lore wise jet hasnt been invented yet (apparently....it seems there was a vault in fallout 4 that had a terminal that talked about it prewar I think so it is something for lore fans to argue over)
---
pre-war money, like ammo, took a hit for gameplay over all else, and cant be sold to help keep inflation down. (kinda like in WoW lore wise resurrection is a hard spell that takes days but your priest can cast it in a few seconds)
---
In my opinion, it's super addicting, but once you complete the main quest line, there isn't much to do besides events and camp building, so it drops off a bit. 
---
It’s pretty good. Survival servers are out tomorrow 
---
Noo I don't want to be a dick! XD
---
Why does that bother you though? I'm like you, my PA stays in my inventory until I'm about to go against...well it used to be scorchbeasts and super mutant canes, but now that I have my build ironed out I rarely use it at all. Mostly to jump off cliffs when I don't want to go around 😂
---
It doesn't bother me that other people do it though. If that's how they want to play the game, they should feel free, and it shouldn't bother you that badly.
---
You just spoiled this for me for real
---
I like them because they're a gear check. Keeps folks on their toes when they've ventured too far.  They also remind me to fix my perks when I've been running around the map with my crafting ones enabled. I hunt them down for fun. Occasionally you'll find one packing heat. Like a radium or handmade which I love scrapping for mods 
---
Head of nail, meet hammer.
---
Well if you've already got it, give it a whirl and see for yourself.  You might like it.  
---
Had some guy try and nuke the event last night. He launched it right when we started fighting the sloth so we had plenty of time to finish the event, trade, and walk out of the radius.
---
He quit the server after he failed to kill everyone. I’ll admit I laughed. 
---
I definitely thought I put my system on the post, my bad! I’m on PS4
---
Seriously! That lamp would be awesome. To those complaining about it potentially being sold for Atoms in the Atomic Shop; It's a cosmetic item that everyone would want. Therefore it would make a ton of money for Bethesda, some of which would be funnelled into development for more stuff. As long as it's priced at a fair point (300 - 600 atoms IMO) there's little to be upset at.
---
Actually I run up in the ritual mask and bindings so I probably look bad but let me lovvvve you. 
---
it dont bother me. it just looks dumb.
---
Yeah still fairly new to the game. I had about 28 hours in and no one had ever attacked me so some guy does it out of the blue and kills me. Loots a shit ton of junk from me. I choose revenge, am at the spot a minute and he's gone. Nowhere to be found on the map at all. 
---
No, I do not own Cap Collector perk card. This is exclusive to Fortune Finder perk card
---
How very true but the thing that blows my mind about all this is it's not a weapon or armor that can be used to advance your game. It's a freaking cosmetic mask that can only be obtained during one week out of the year.
---
 Why hide something like that behind a ridiculous drop rate?
---
 I wouldn't be surprised if they add them to the Atam shop when the event is over for a ridiculous price.
---
 Seems Bethesda doesn't really care about their playerbase as much as they care about the Almighty dollar lately. 
---
I messaged you
---
The Mr fuzzy tokens sort of exist this way in 76. You are awarded the tokens for the Camden events. After you receive 450 tokens you can get to complete mascot outfit. You don't see many people running around with those outfits so it's effectively a "rare item" even though it's completely accessible. If you want to increase the chance of getting rare items just dump more tokens into people's laps after an event.
---
Low levels
---
Why is it dumb to get wanted for breaking into someone else's stuff?
---
Oof.  That happened to me twice at Whitesprings in times past.  I keep a hot-keyed hazard suit in my inventory at all times, now.
---
Suk a fat dong.
---
Chef's Hat, Lab Coat and fashionable glasses or welding goggles.
---
If you're having trouble finding a spawn and don't want to server hop, the bar in Whitespring should have some for sale.
---
If only there were a way for you to form your own opinion on the matter...
---
The way that thing reads implies that it applies to all Zenimax products which would include ESO. Regardless of what 76 does or does not have and what ESO does or does not have is made irrelevant with the excerpt shown above. Read it carefully and it is most definitely sending a contradictory message which is all I was pointing out. IF Zenimax really means exactly what that says then it would include ESO as well which will upset the entire PC player base which uses mods which is probably everyone on ESO PC. Not looking for a debate just pointing out the obvious in the text.
---
Yep. Or it shows them as offline... when they're literally standing next to me in game. I also get an issue where friends go missing from my list at random, too. Only way to fix it is to restart.
---
Guess I was bound to get some awful opinions. You like them because they do something every other enemy in the game could potentially do without being as boring to fight.
---
cause if you are good and sneaky, you should get away scott free
---
FeelsBadMan
---
There is no mechanic to implement that with people though. If it was an NPC thing then sure, but we as players would have to report them or something.
---
Not to mention with all the tech and the instant warning that something is getting attacked, it just makes sense that we would know that something was broken into.
---
A level 7 at the end actually attacked him at the end when it made other players actually able to attack eacother again
---
Then I'd assume you're trying to either A), recruit me to join the Cult of the Mothman, or B), kill me and feed my corpse to a Snallygaster. Either way, I'm gonna run from and/or shoot at you.
---
How about more bugs in general.
---
How many technical data did it take to get all of those
---
Day 1 Overwhelmingly Negative reviews. YouTubers start up talking about it again. Hate cycle begins again.
---
Thats it really? I do wonder if synths will be coming to 76 in a near future to "act" as NPCs.
---
Junk bag only spawns after they can’t be revived anymore 
---
I think of it as a tale of two games. 
---
TL:DR-A personal experience of two recently popular online game's community.
---
My best friend and i both got Red Dead Redemption 2 at the same time and tried the online game. First time in game, still getting used to the controls and not doing anything to anybody, we got stuck in a town and took us over 10 minutes of trying to get out of the place before giving up the game in disgust as we kept just getting killed by randos as soon as we respawned anywhere. Even if we tried to get indoors, they followed inside. Second time, we spent close to an hour just quietly hunting, and got a pretty big haul between us to sell that included bear and cougar. On the way to sell it, again, some rando decided to sniper kill us for no reason except his jollies and we lost the lot, bar some rabbit and squirrel. Pissed us both off. 
---
Fallout 76 i had been playing since release date, been having great fun and seeing how the community was evolving in game and friendly forums. Finally got my friend into it last month. First time in game for him, we get him to the Overseers camp and two guys show up and drop him over 1100 rounds of 10mm that will do him well for when he can use it. Second time in game,we were just exploring and sightseeing the place and at two different places,two different people showed up and gave the both of us items. Including one in a pretty  intimidating set of X01 PA who got out of it just to wave hello. 
---
We have a pretty good crew in here. 
---
Did the institute exist at that time?
---
Some people find them boring. I do not. But I also kill them very quickly. Not much time to get bored .
---
"1300 with my bloodied Dragon."
---
Whereas I'm a stealth build and have a TSE dragon with demolition expert 5.  Base damage is 596 and I have a 2.5x stealth multiplier, so I get 1490 out of the weapon not counting critical hits.  Figure 1/4 of a L50 scorch beast's health per shot (non-crit).
---
I get 190x2.5=475 per shot out of a conventional lever action rifle with 9 levels of rifleman and 3 tank killer.  That is further tweaked by concentrated fire via headshots and crits plus crits being affected by Eagle Eyes mutation.  I can't even calculate a headshot crit from sneak, but maybe someone else here can.  It's substantially higher than 475 and is usually a one-shot to a L68 supermutant.
---
TL,DR:
---
Bloodied/Low health builds are not the only way to play the game.  ;)
---
Find out tomorrow, I'll let you know if I'm one shotting people! :)
---
I really don’t follow your logic that a bad game is decent if it’s on Steam. 
---
Doubt it.
---
I've been using the storeroom to add a new mutation each day when I get my daily booze quest from BIV. I'm up to 7 now and hoping I can get the few I really want before I get stuck with Empath.
---
Well we know you can post stats from the game, so announce how many times the event was played, and how many rare masks were dropped.
---
Same problem. Solution is you and your friend go back in menu, re-team in menu then the one who own the team launch a game and you join automatically. I had to do this tonight
---
You can also combo this glitch. If you use the masks to do the glitch and get the assaultron helmet on, to where your head is invisible inside the helmet, you then get into power armor. Get back out, draw/put away weapon. Helmet should open up under the mask. Most noticable on the toothy giant and witch common masks, and more so I'm sure on the rare ones, but can't test it.
---
I'd love a canned coffee producing workshop. Apparently it would be highly contested for PVP
---
At Haven Church in the Mire if you go by it at night the organ will be playing creepy music. The first time this happened to me I didn’t know where it was coming from and all I heard was a faint dirge slowly growing louder as I homed in. The snarls and scuffles of the wendigo just make it worse. Gaaaaaah!
---
I had to put radaway on my favorites for just this reason, takes so long for armor to come out that the only thing you can do most of the time is shotgun radaway and hop it's enough to keep you alive. 
---
It would either need to be a conversion to Steam (don't know if that's  thing), or tied to a specific Steam account (pretty sure that's not a thing), or else people would just sell them.
---
I agree, I just don't see a vehicle to get to that point.
---
I’m a big fan of the Hunters Longcoat/Tattered Mole Head combination 
---
Can someone make rolling pin lvl 1 and lvl 5 and give it to me? PSN: Tommy_n1ghtmare
---
Good job on that!
---
Im not entirely sure. Maybe they did? Cant place when 1st gen synths came out.
---
Watch all the kids still bitter try and tank that review
---
in so far as that is where a non-vault-tec bunker with people is, I am not sure if they orginized into the institute yet, but they certainly do not have synths at this time.
---
No, that sounds exactly like "rare" to me
---
Haha yes!
---
I don’t know i just completed fallout 4 for the first time lol
---
If you think about it, a bounty makes you a target and is literally a license for others to kill you.  Someone trying to do so should not agro your team.
---
Hell yeah keep that shit!
---
Atomic shop is now available, for me anyway not sure about others...
---
Yeah I find one of the funnest things to do is go in with my Jetpack X-01 and TSE Plasma Gatling to an area where lower levels need help. The reactions are priceless to seeing me to this and then saying "Me Frank Horrigan, that's who United States Secret Service"
---
Yup, I messed with this a lot as well a few days ago. Wasn’t sure how known it was, it looks pretty cool in some cases. I’ll try it on the rare masks as soon as one drops! 
---
It looked awesome on the map.  The results were decidedly less so.
---
Oh which faction? Do you plan on doing the DLCs?
---
Hunters longcoat with sunglasses and faschnacht beret or military beret
---
I did the brotherhood and I am doing far harbor right now 
---
Institute existed Day one after the great war, they moved under ground before the bombs dropped 
---
You can get accounts for free on XB1. Make another account and link it in your family and it gets gold. You can make as many as you like just as long as you play on a console where the owner has gold. Should be free.
---
Aw, shucks 
---
But did synth exist because i know that they needed fathers dna for gen 2+ as far as I know
---
For real. I make hats, and with the money I take out of the vendors registers, I use it to make more hats.
---
"In 2110, the survivors and their descendants founded the Institute, an organization dedicated to furthering pre-War science" What year is fallout 76 ? 
---
Performance, monetization, design, moderation. In pretty much every way that matters, it's one of the biggest fuckups of BGS history, certainly of the last decade.
---
I wasn’t offended and I wasn’t trying to talk smack about Fallout 76. Were good 👍
---
Not even 2100 because 2077 + 25
---
Your floors facing different directions is triggering my OCD hard.
---
Because the game is not exactly designed to cater to those who are griping about it. There are bugs and glitches, yes (what online game doesn't have at least a few?). There were also complaints about the lack of human NPCs... You play 76 as one of the first to emerge from the vaults so there would be no humans (other than mutated ones that came from those that didnt make it into a vault) with full stores and settlements. The glitch complaint was invalidated because most that complained also were taking advantage of said glitches to dupe etc. Then those same people received bans which gave them further reason to gripe.
---
There were also complaints about balance and metas but all games I have ever played have gone through nerfs/buffs in order to bring things into a more balanced system and there have always been preferred meta builds for PvE/PvP/etc.
---
It all essentially comes down the fact that no form of entertainment media (games/movies/books/etc) is going to appeal to everyone. Always judge things from your experience &amp; not off what others say or feel...
---
Just use them whenever you feel like having a giggle and blowing up a few mole rats with a nuke. Unless you have a two-shot Fat Man or something, the weapon's not really worth its weight otherwise - it's rather less powerful than you'd expect so it's probably best to stick to your regular weapons for actual, serious fights.
---
This has happened to me twice (claim this workshop, get shot for your troubles).  I now leave the server after completing the challenge.
---
Jump on top of the Red Rocket in Flatwoods 
---
Gen 3 didnt exist around 76 
---
Indeed. Now that's a good idea right there. They need to bring more ideas from all the fallout games in the past as long as it fits the fallout 76 setting. I grew up around books and not socialize with others that much. Military helped me get confidence and learn to socialize better with other individuals. It's a WIP. Glad to see I was a go on intelligence. Sometimes it's good to talk to other players who understand what I talk about and i tried my best to make it easier for some people who never went our path. I hope they can get a grasp on what I'm trying to show so that they can enjoy some new things that may be helpful. I'm here to help and not cause problems but there will be both sides who agree or disagree with ideas put out before them.
---
when you join a team your mic gets set to (TEAM) you need to set it back to (AREA)
---
Why is the map being bigger a good thing? 
---
So cool!  Love the floors!
---
&gt;Wanna I don’t know maybe describe why that is or are you just going to attack me now?
---
oh wow, you really don't know the difference. okay, the concept of a "participation trophy" is the idea that you are given something just because you showed up/participated. this is not at all the same thing as working for, *earning,* a reward. its pretty straightforward.
---
&gt;because everyone will just grind the event to get the reward
---
it's like you didn't even read the OP before commenting. yeah, sure, everyone will grind for the reward (gross exaggeration, because even if the masks were guaranteed at 100 runs, the great majority wouldn't do it) but that doesn't mean that everyone will get one. it will still be a lottery, except that a few more people may get it because they *earned* it.
---
&gt; If you also think that just because you grind the event you should have a better chance at something then someone who doesn’t grind the event that is exactly what entitlement.
---
no, it isn't lol. if i was sitting here saying "I HAVE A RIGHT TO A MASK, IM OWED ONE, I DID THIS MANY." *that's* entitlement. im just suggesting that rewards should let you work towards it instead of being a complete toss up. again, not saying everyone who did 100+ runs is entitled to a mask. just saying that it should be considered. 
---
if you don't agree, then that's cool. i have my opinion, you have yours, end of discussion. but don't act like its just a whole bunch of entitled kids crying "gimme my mask!" OPs post is a completely reasonable model and isn't calling for handouts.
---
also, gonna take the opportunity to say that it's fucking embarrassing that so many people are blindly defending Bethesda on this. you don't want to change the rates? fine. how about transparency? you would think the community would at least support things that come into question. instead, issues are written off by asinine commenters like yourself, looking past any issues with the system going "muh these kids and their entitlement." if everything is as fine as Bethesda suggested it is, why don't we have numbers? we should have odds, and an overall tally post-event detailing how many masks dropped. they are so sure that they are dropping, so they should have that metric right? why argue against releasing that info? its so fucked that so many of us are blindly looking for these masks that may not even be dropping properly. the game has been buggy from day zero, but all of a sudden Bethesda has flawless code? the code suggests there are 3 tiers: common, uncommon, rare. where are the tiers? so far we have 5 common masks (appropriately labeled in code) and the rest are about as rare as a winning lottery ticket - including the ones labeled uncommon. how does that make sense? if there is anything that I think we're entitled to, it's an answer to those questions.
---
&gt; Like I said people don’t agree with you
---
also quit saying this, it just makes you sound like an ass. all of a sudden you're the voice of the people with your original comment sitting at -9? ok guy. you sound like trump: "people tell me all the time!" "people are saying it, all the people." "I've heard from people, lots of people are saying it."
---
Yea so they most likely won’t appear as npc
---
 Oh I like a bunch of em', so that can take a while. I hunt them. I want a 'pissing in the fissure' photo mode badly, as I seek them out and troll the occupant.
---
 I will not use VATS and I hip shoot em' with a Lever Action. I figure I'm getting 60%+ into her and I target the wing roots for a quicker resolution. I kill em' with a knife. ;)
---
 Its just so much fun. There was this one time I was jumped near the edge of the bog and she ran pretty quick. I chased her sorry ass almost to Watoga and ran smack into a Mirelurk Queen as I did so. Literally ran into her, she's like 2 stories tall. ;)
---
May the full eclipse of mothy borthers and sisters note the infamous name of pencilgun which is to be recorded as one beyond redemption and destined for tarnation once his flesh becomes fodder for larvae. So mote it be.
---
I have a Fatman that only ways 6 pounds so weight isn't really an issue. But I get what you mean
---
If you look closer, it is actually a very carefully arranged hatch pattern :)
---
You can only get violet flux when someone nukes WS. right? We have the plans for fusion core generator. Shame we couldn’t put the 1/2, 1/4 partially used FC to charge them.
---
I've had this issue and found that my in game chat  settings were set to team. Changing it to auto or area helped me before. If you already have done this,  then I'm not sure what your issue may be.
---
I think that would be neat on xbox I'm cowboyhat98
---
There isn’t much of a point to life with that attitude, there are lots of places to explore with marsupial, just use your imagination.
---
I will answer here so i don't get heavily downvoted but i don't think this is such a big deal. You played this game for a couple of hours and already think you met the "nicest" people in this game? Isn't that kinda early to assume ? Anyway, good luck with the game , enjoy your stay.
---
Another bullshit TV preacher. ;)
---
I had not experienced that issue before then, and what a time to have it happen.  I will also add it to my favorites as you suggest.
---
I’ve done that in the past but then my teammate also goes to area. I’m wondering if it’s possible to have my teammates on Team chat but everyone else hear us aswell
---
I get it but that pisses me off. Would have much rather played it on Steam in the first place but because i was an early supporter I'm stuck with the Beth Launcher. No way in hell I'm buying it a second time. I bought the freaking CE I've payed enough already. Speaking of which where the hell are you are on the bags u/BethesdaGameStudios_ ?
---
That’s also a spot that a specific flower grows in- I can’t remember the name but I glows and grows on trees. There’s only a few spots where you can find it. So maybe they are collecting them?
---
Oh, I saw it, but it still would be a no-no for my camp.  Everything else in your place looks nice though.
---
Buy my beard? Admittedly I haven’t played a ton of Hearthstone but you can buy beards?
---
Gotta love Leroy Jenkins!!
---
Feet for the fetish room.
---
They don't need to respond 
---
 They dumb. ;)
---
We're on the same team!
---
I wonder if it would increase chances of a rare mask?
---
Steam would have been a better option. Average steam customer cares more about a story than the average epic customer. At least, at this point they do
---
PS4 restart of complete team solves the team up bug for us.
---
But you explore and that is kind of the point of Fallout, so you are at least likely to find new and hidden things. 
---
I concur with your statement.lolz 👍

I knew it was a bad idea the moment I read it in the notes but this is much worse than I imagined. I've avoided workshop since the patch and generally swap server afterwards. Even before the change I stopped waiting for the defense mission when I realized people can trigger the claim radius just to kill me with full damage when I'm standing nowhere near the workbench and never tried to contest their claim attempt. The patch just amplified that form of trolling.
---
&gt;s about 3 hours and 3-4 cores just for that  baring any side tracking.  I’d love to have all the weight reduction perks loaded but it’s really not feasible if I wanna fight anything really at all.  It’s not uncommon to go thru 5 if I get hit in a bunch of scorch beast battles but yeah I may have to try and tweak my build to add it in if I can’t come up with a way to find cores.  I haven’t yet taken it and none of my packs had it drop.
---
Wierd.  I got batteries included about L30.  I have read there is a power consumption reduction perk that drops starting @ L50. IDK, havent made 50 yet.   (Not sure if packrat affects core weight.)
---
At 127, you're probably no longer spending much time back in the western part of the map - at 47, I havent spent much time out of points westward.
---
That distinction noted, there are (at least) a dozen spawn points in the forest (other than posiedon) that dont require PvP- I hit one last night after leaving the parade - and picked up 3 cores in the same building  - one at 25, 2 more at 80+  
---
Each time I did the parade, I visit that building .... 
---
Last night, found two different spawn points literally right across the street from each other in the ash heap.
---
Since I'm always overencumbered and have to walk everywhere, I check all the spawn points I pass in my travels...so I have what some might think is a rediculous amount of cores.

" **90sMemelord ign grushnak has stolen me** "
---
Help I've been "stolen me" and I cant get up! Unfuckingbelievable
---
Maybe (AUTO) but I have no idea how that setting works. I dont team up that much.
---
Few years too early (like 100+).
---
What sorcery is this ?
---
What's the games current condition?
---
I haven't been keeping up and last I heard/read was when they dropped a patch that undid a lot of fixes and it was a while of checking up on it and still not seeing anything being done. So is it better than ever or still full of disconnects etc? I never ran into bugs much, it was the disconnecting that made me quit. Taking forever to launch a nuke bc you have to run around doing pointless garbage just to put a code in and consumable, just to be dc'd and lose that server.  
---
I miss FO but don't want to waste more time on it if it's not in good enough condition STILL.
---
Maybe they can do something similar to what ubisoft and rockstar have that unlocks the game bypassing needing a key altogether but allows you to use the steam launcher instead.
---
Honestly, I’ve only had good experiences and interactions with other players on 76. I don’t know if that is because I play on pc but everyone is super cool and the majority seem to be playing like Fallout/Elder scrolls fans. So I’m glad the haters are playing something else. Keep spreading the good vibes 👍
---
Bloodied builds are easy pickings for pvp. I say let them attack you. And if you dont like go passive 
---
Except for war, War never changes...
---
 Considering her voice actor, I wish if every once in a while she dropped an "I WILL DESTROY YOU" and other Jack-isms. 
---
Nobody wins because these are so rare:
---
First if the masks don’t get out and don’t get used, what’s the point!  If this game makes it to next year people should have been excited to get out their rare masks and go to the parade, but no it’ll be the same masks everyone has and maybe the next 5 drop this year? 
---
Next, they are so rare those people who did win them can’t use them because everyone will be accusing them of cheating 
---
Then Bethesda can’t use this to advertise/ brag on cause everyone’s so salty now. 
---
All are punished 
---
The way i have fun after completing the game is trying to collect all power armor and power armor mods (200+ hours in and still not done), doing all events, getting every rare event item (again, still not done with this), legendary farming, and launching nukes every possible chance i get (in my opinion this is the most fun out of the bunch). Another way i havent tried is just trying a new playstyle. Been doing mostly melee since launch. Also, PvP is pretty fun.
---
bully for you. most people aren't ever going to get to the level where that happens because there's not enough content to justify it. you're bringing your weird edge-case as an argument against the majority of cases- which are going to be people watching the same two attacks happen over and over while their weapons do nothing.
---
What mask are you wearing? How do I get it?
---
I've been tempted to convert my Furious Combat rifle into a Full auto .38, just to use the ammo I stockpile...It'd let me use my .45 soley for my Executioner's lever action..
---
this is my #1 concern in the game along with server stability
---
Workshop PVP should stay in the Workshop
---
I agree, why having *, ** and *** enemies if the drops are just random. It doesnt makes much sense. I am lvl 167 and all i do is looking for legendaries.  *** legendary items are very rare to find for me. And if i find one its a pretty shitty weapon or armor.. 
---
Yes! Main reason i love RPGs. Just traveling and taking in the world at your finger tips.
---
Main reason why it took me years to complete the main story in fo4...wait I still have yet to rofl
---
Have you completed all the quests and side quests? Have you done every event? Have you found every location? In the immortal last words of Calvin and Hobbes: "It's a magical world...let's go exploring"
---
This game is choose your own adventure. Find out what's fun for you and do it. If only following the main story is all that's fun for you, then you are done. A lot of people like collecting so they try to find all the outfits. Or they like camp building so they work to get all the plans and build neat camps.  Others like being a merchant so they farm items to sell or trade.  Some like finding all the little secret unnamed locations. You do you.
---
Start farming legendary items for your build? Have you found every location? Maybe rebuild a camp? Side quests all completed? Photo tour? SBQ fight? Tbh, I’m lvl 99 and I sometimes struggle deciding what to do as there’s still loads I haven’t done yet. 
---
Sorry for just throwing vague suggestions, hopefully you find some inspiration lol.
---
Atom shop. I think it cost 350 or so.
---
So it is a console story after all. Got it.
---
Auto pistols went from being fantastic to garbage since the latest critical hit nerf. I had about 3,000 damage to deal in 1.7 seconds under ideal circumstances.
---
I switched to single shot pistols so I could actually get some damage out of my PVP vats critical build. My black powder pistol does over 1,800 damage under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions here being vats, sneak attack, head shot, critical hit, and in range.
---
It is ok for PVE. Before the nerf a scorchbeast would be left with maybe 25% HP remaining. Now they have about 50% life left after my burst damage.
---
Probably Not, but i could See bethesda but in real humans after we dealt with the scorched plague, after all there are New Main quests coming in summer. And iam Not thinking wva will be unpopulated for ever, after all the Slogan of the game is rebuilding America. 
---
Thats why I control my arch with a pressure pad.  Can't leave that bad boy running.
---
Yes, it will break the balance
---
Lol same, u have a bloodied melee character among my toons  xD
---
Yea but that wouldn’t make much sense because you can still nuke the queen 
---
it happened to me a bunch of times when I was hopping servers at whitesprings looking for Power Armor mods. 
---
Bombs dropped in 2077 vault 76 opened 25 years later.
---
2077 + 25 = 2102
---
So 8 years before the institute was founded.
---
The BoS paint is an in game paint and as such won't have the atomic shop logo next to it 
---
Same holds true for all weight reduced items in your inventory.  They don't apply to stash weights, and it doesn't not display full weight in the GUI, even when the item is in your Stash.  (I believe there are mods for PC users to show real weight values, but not for vanilla or consoles).
---
I was able to log in and play for a while.
---
I love this
---
Thats kind of depressing i really hope they add some type of npc's. 
---
That was a complete pile of a comment, run across the map with only a knife and standard armour and see if you get bored .
---
Yeah like I said, I’m not against a change like that but really this threads more focused on zero cap PvP exploiting. Even if their team couldn’t attack you back, the wanted player could and if they don’t have any caps then there’s nothing to lose. 
---
I'm sorry. You asked for anyone having positive opinion of them. I've stated mine, and you've twice replied negatively.  I'm confused by your request and intentions. I'm not trying to convince anyone else; just stating that I enjoy fo76 cliffracers more than TES3 cliffracers . Peace.
---
I mean teeeeeechnially there are they are just robots and mutants
---
Thank you for this!
---
I like it the way it is thanks. PvP is map wide... Watch your back!
---
Did your friends actually play the game? Or did they just assume its bad because of the youtube vids
---
Can I interest you in a brahmin hide said to have been chewed upon by the divine Mothman in his larval form?  A merre 10K caps and it can be yours to inspire all your friends and acquaintances to envious paroxysms of joy at your divine blessing?  If not there is a penitent from another vault that has expressed more than a passing interest in this one of kind relic of mothy divinity.
---
Hard Bargain level 3 perk and you can sell for 35c each.
---
Tried whitesprings first and didn’t find any.  Simple rehop at Al’s and I was good to go
---
Just 100% done with this game now. The event was fun and it was nice seeing players working together, which is like the core for fallout 76 / "rebuilding Appalachia" but I'd rather be grinding my teeth down with a file than grinding for masks that literally impossible to obtain. My two cents I guess. 
---
Yeah it’s an American thing lol 
---
Yes! 
---
Last night's SBQ reward was a 1 star hatchet,  a left arm ultracite power armor plan, and 3 stable flux.  Well worth the about 1,700 ultracite 5.56 ammo I used.  I feel your pain.
---
totally agree
---
Plenty of sites let you link your steam account for various benefits.  There should be a way to do the same thing with bethesda.  They would just need to take the time to implement it.
---
Yea but its not great, i mean some of them arent bad. I didnt mind rosie to much she had some funny moments.
---
That would be ever so useful.
---
Right click the shortcut in steam and select Properties, in the "set launch options"  type in "bethesdanet://run/20" without quotes, it should launch without requiring the password every time, it may still ask for it once in awhile, as it does such thing for me.
---
I wish there was more with her
---
Dunno who downvoted you but I voted you back up one lol
---
Found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b48kgi/spawn\_point\_locations\_for\_the\_lemonade\_robot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b48kgi/spawn_point_locations_for_the_lemonade_robot/)  
---
I don't want to promote my post but it has some locations and their sources.  
---
Basic: there are random spawns everywhere in Fallout. Keep a lookout for balloons.  
---
 You'll find him. The recepies are neat and lemonade is cafted very simple.  
---
If the workshop was being actively contested, you know what sure. Let it be global.
---
But the moment that the workshop control is taken over, that PvP flag should be removed. There's no reason someone should be able to step onto your claimed workshop's radius for 1 second, and then be allowed to fast travel to you and kill you with impunity anywhere in the world. 
---
Yup, that is what I did when the game came out, I only launch Bethesda launcher when I need updates for the game.
---
New plans: Fully charged core =2 - 25% cores + 23 Stable Violet Flux
---
Seems to me I've heard of something like that before as well, though it wasn't something that had to be specifically allowed, just a 'thing' you could do in Steam.
---
Might have been in a bygone era, if I'm even remembering it right.
---
That wouldn't tie achievements into Steam though, which I guess some people care about.
---
It's worth it. Use the .38 on low-level stuff or for tagging during group events, then all your .45 exists for the Lever Action. You can basically just drop down to those two weapons for most content, pull out a Handmade when things get too serious.
---
See that is the bull shit in your opinion of my opinion. I didn't say fallout 76 sucks. I love the game.  It is your preconcieved notions that anyone who thinks the atom store is the path to success means the game must suck. I actually think that Bethesda can rescue the financials of the game if they make the atom store awesome. Realistically they are not going to make the game awesome on title sales alone. Not when they are discounting the price down as they have been. 
---
No one is yelling that fortnite is failing because they give the game away for cheap / free and make their money on the store.
---
Maybe your gun just broke? Check in what condition it is in...
---
Their ground attacks are pretty much harmless.  Level 80 SB lands, it's basically saying "Kill me please".  While it's in the air it doesn't do a lot of damage (those screeches while blinding are not very powerful) but it is mobile enough that non-VATS attacks, specially while blinded by a screech, are very difficult to land.
---
And VATS AP doesn't last very long to land but a handful of placed hits.  Which is where reliable VATS targetting of wings would come into play.  A few well placed wing shots, maybe a crit, on one wing and it's maneuverability is hampered.  A few well placed on each, and it's crashing.
---
Still crashing *a lot*. 2 separate occasions I’ve tried launching a nuke just for the server to crash immediately after taking my key card. 
---
Yeah, melee often fails to register direct hits properly.. the game even plays the sound effect of it hitting. Plus; it makes me sad every time I press the melee button and character doesn't melee. 😔
---
go around back. People farm the entrance across from the clubhouse a lot, but seldom the main entrance or putting green
---
"They kill people who aren't ready to fight them" and "I'm high enough level so it doesn't matter to me!" are not strong opinions tho.
---
Nah, for a few days now, having this happen widespread, guns and melee...  Hope it's not just me.
---
What balance?
---
The only way to do this is to use a program like teamspeak or discord for team chat and the game for area chat.
---
Saw jester on ps4. They do drop afaik.
---
Pretty much,  but for me as soon as I completed the defense,  a three digit fella showed up,  waved at me, and proceeded to sledgehammer me up death with two hits.
---
Jackass.....
---
Does Herd Mentality and Empath stack? If me and my three party members had HM does it stack and give +8 to all SPECIAL stats? Or is it just +2? 
---
Ok... Never encountered this bug.
---
Lucky me
---
But I will look out for it
---
There is no end game
---
This! Or you hit the melee button once and for some reason it swings like 3 times and you just gotta sit there and wait before you can do anything 
---
No need to activate Poseidon. Just drop a fusion generator and plug in the fusion core machine. It starts cranking out cores as long as it has 100 power.
---
I got most of my mutations from the barrels and pool right outside of the mine.  I bought speed demon and marsupial, but got talons, bird bones, unstable isotope, and electrically charged from bathing in that pool.  My understanding is if you take the shower or use radaway with starched genes removed it will take out the last mutation added. 
---
I got Empath pretty early on. *groan* It doesn't seem to effect me too badly, but I tend to run with a teammate more often than not.
---
Well if you want companions you have to find other players to tag along with.  If everyone would have companions it would be a bit weird no? Imagine 10 players at whitesprings and everyone has dogmeat as companion..  Or you get wanted because you accidently killed someones companion.  In fallout 4 i didnt used companions much, they mostly stand in front of your aim sight or blocking the way. The good thing about them was that they could carry your stuff. 
---
 Your god is a devil. You are a poor dupe doing his bidding and all right thinking people should hunt the evil Mothman.
---
 Now my god is sleeping deep in the mine. Someday he will awaken and we will bring justice to all. Your pitiful excuse will just poof ... like a moth in a flame.
---
now if only i could get my account linked to steam and play via steam
---
Sutton station. There are 2 tables outside that have a chance to spawn them or an empty bottle. If both are empty, server hop and check again. Don't touch the empty ones and full ones may spawn with a server hop. But if you pick up an empty by accident, a full one wont respawn in that spot until your personal timer resets. 
---
Unless they changed it, dropped bags leave when you log off, but items in storage containers persist
---
I usually invite anyone that shows up to group. Most accept. If they refuse, then I know they just came to fight.
---
Been happening to me if switching weapons. End up barehanded and have to open the menu to equip 
---
I'd rather just run Batteries Included and keep the partial cores at that point haha
---
Hmm. Good idea. Just not sure if discord would block the area chat. I know on other games it does such as PUBG. I’ll try it though. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I don't have a problem with them... They take like a minute to kill and have a small chance to drop rare plans. Also the corpses littered around their fissures are full of loot and there's usually 3 around most fissures, not to mention ultracite nodes for ammo if you are using a prime receiver. 
---
Actually, they have a support site all set up for this and any other issues.  If they plan to not respond to their support site, why do they have it?
---
Well, heres hoping they do. It would probably earn back a lot of peoples respect for Bethesda.
---
I have class freak 3 so you don’t suffer negative effects (or much less) from the mutations.  It’s a must have if you have a number of them. 
---
It's kind of a dumb stat tbh. Why force people to run around with low HP? Although it obviously wasn't designed to be used that way as I'm sure Bethesda intended it to be a backup mechanic for losing a fight, like auto-stim armor.
---
It would be nice.
---
Well, if they allowed acount transfer or connection to bethesda account (basically if we don't lose progress) and offered some discount (like 50-75%) to existing users, I would probably buy the game on steam, I bit the bullet to play the game on [Beth.net](https://Beth.net), but the launcher is really barebones and quite glitchy...
---
Well ESO has approved coding method/guidelines for addons, while F76 does not. What means ESO addons, built by following guidelines of documentation on how to build addon for ESO, it goes automatically under approved third party applications. 
---
Just the last one?  Sweet, nice feature
---
Do not bother with bugs and wolves, kill the sloth afap because event is complete once he’s down.
---
Interesting thought.  I'm not sure how "honest" that would be though.  I do appreciate the suggestion though.
---
Or if they ever have the ability for players to be infected by The scorch plague, have regular NPCs show up as scorched enemies.
---
&gt; Last night, got attacked in a nuke zone by a L297.
---
You need to familiarize yourself with pacifist mode. Not turning that on is why this guy could attack you. One stray shot, and they can take you out. With pacifist turned on, this cannot happen.
---
Thanks, I will try that. 
---
This game is the example of make your own opinion. I love it. My brother wont even try it because of his friends. Try it. If you don't like it trade or get rid of it. You already own it. What's the harm in a day of trials. 
---
Market price ? I have seen it twice only 
---
Who gives a shit. I will play it.
---
Yes I make sure to keep all the circuits I find!
---
I watched my boyfriend play for a while before I finally made my own person so I went in knowing that I absolutely NEEDED to keep certain things like circuits! I saw the hell he went through when it came tiMe to make his excavator PA so I keep all the black titanium I find too. Although I’m not really a heavy PA user. I just hit level 30 and I’m using my T51 here and there so I can burn up the million fusion cores I amassed lol! 
---
But anyways, back to your original point, definitely keep circuits! Thank you!
---
I did use the loadout mod. I will try this, thank you! I did think a reinstall whould also reset my ini files but I guess not.
---
The reward isn't the event, man.
---
Meeting other players, checking out their outfits. Maybe some post parade PVP if thats what your into. Thats what makes the event fun.
---
No idea... happy to take offers
---
prewar money = cloth + acid = gun power + steel + lead = bullet + Enemy = dead enemy = "Fun"
---
if you follow my math. Money = "Fun"
---
It’s code for “that guy” that wants to come around and mess with you with melee weapon.  Or someone with a lower level weapon that is trying to gank you with multiple hits that inflict little to no damage. 
---
I heard they wanted to have the bugs fixed majoritivly before realizing it to steam
---
The celestial Mothman soars over the dead entombed remains of a would-be god who lays dreaming of ever eluding greatness and sheds a single scale from his wings then flaps on to fulfill his divine destiny.
---
PA/regular armor balance
---
I have noticed this too. It does seem to require you to go at least partial of the way into the reload animation (like 2 secs) before swapping to another weapon for at least 10 secs or something. 
---
I did not know this, thank you! I will try this.
---
More to explore naturally. But it gives you a chance to either continue exploring  new regions in order to be a well traveled wanderer, or limit yourself to one particular sector in a need to find every single settlement and shack. Which in other fallout games usually meant seperate dlcs 
---
Wow, people do not like to hear the truth I guess.  All these down votes for saying this?!?
---
Fire away 
---
I believe it’s because of the 30 percent cut from steam. That’s a lot of money, I would go with epic if that was the case. Does not apply to me as I play on console anyways.
---
This is what's happening to me.  Not cool in the middle of a fight.
---
Interesting, I'd always thought the institute was the Fallout version of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) It made sense with Fallout 4 being set in Boston, MIT is in Cambridge.
---
Maybe I'm just reading too much into it.
---
I’m steering clear of launching a nuke until Bethesda can improve server reliability.  I don’t want to waste a bunch of time and ammo and chems only to get glitched out of it.  Not sure what has happened recently but the drops and log outs are happening a lot more frequently now. 
---
No it's fine. Still fun to be had if you're a fallout fan.
---
Everyone on this sub already plays it. The point is that new players are now going to see overwhelmingly negative since people are gonna buy it just to leave a bad review and then refund.
---
No new players.
---
if so, I'm a little sorry. Item locking for not selling and breaking is surely needed.
---
I find so much gunpowder ive never needed to make it regular. But thanks good tip !
---
And then you have the pieces of shit that legit try to pvp anything that moves or breathes. I was at the Charleston station trying to repair some of my weapons and some lvl 100ish asshat in full x01 power armor started to pound me with a super sledge, even when I tried to show him I didn't mean any harm
---
50% shot with a black powder now? That’s pretty great to me lol. May I ask what perk cards you used?
---
As do I she had me rolling a few times.
---
I've sent you a friends request, I'm on now though.
---
Agree that workshop PVP is broken, but there's ways around having to use them. Just about any resource they provide you can find elsewhere, and with the right perks you can produce them in greater quantities (I'm looking at you, ammo factory). 
---
THANK YOU!!!!
---
Tbh I'm trying to become a good Samaritan by just giving low level people weapons I don't use anymore. So far it's worked with the snubnosed .44 and the 10mm pistol with extended mag, suppressor, and reflex sight
---
There is nothing against it? It’s how you make multiple accounts for games like r6s. There is no rule against it and you can just say it’s a different person.
---
it may be because i can never have enough bullets. but then again i actually enjoy using weapons like the minigun
---
Our group of 3 people did the quests every day. We have some duplicates but not many. We usually share the recepies between us. The greek letter plans have a high reward rate thou. Try selling it to a player if you can. But remember, it is high drop.
---
I saw a player in Watoga log out after seeing a suitcase full of junk then a mule logged in a few seconds later and grabbed it all.
---
How about spending some time exploring this forum?
---
I get it and I agree but on the other you cannot just take seriously gaming "journalism" and reviews from random people. You investigate by yourself, plus you can try it easily on steam and get a refund.
---
People need to fix their mentality as well.
---
Especially the queen 
---
Concentrated fire, covert operative, better criticals for perks. Blight soup for critical damage. Eagle eyes mutation for critical damage. That is the crux of it. Then just get damage perks and utility like escape artist and AP regen to keep those numbers up.
---
I use the gatling plasma varient.
---
And here when I try to help people they just run off without using an emote...
---
I still think it's going to be like deer hunting - sneak around and wait til they are off guard, then unload before they have a chance to react. 
---
But being bigger doesn't equate to more exploration. If you take the content in 76 and spread it over an area twice the size it's still the same amount of things to discover.
---
And Graham and the Lemonade stand share the same pool as Watoga train station.
---
Awesome thanks man!
---
Hey! I accepted your friend request a few days ago :) . It's only 8am where I am (Australia), so I am not on yet :( .
---
If our time zones are an issue,  we might be able to play on weekends together,  as I can play in the mornings then. 
---
Fallout Shelter.  Create Vault 76 and play it as a prequel to F76. Rename best character after your F76 character. 
---
You can buy them from the Enclave, but they are like 19K caps
---
I'm all for them adding them in as long as we are given the option to turn them off.
---
I do crits/pistols. I got lucky and have a bloodied black powder pistol to use after I get a crit ready with a faster firing weapon. I've also got a calibrated receiver (double crit damage) on my western revolver for regular use. And the eagle eye mutation.    
---
I doubt any of this is optimal, but I can kill a scorchbeast with no problems at level 55.  
---

---
I suppose its a small price to pay in the end. Might just be an excuse for people to make a new character and earn them again for those hardcore achievement hunters.
---
Inside Whitesprings clubhouse. Then inside Whitesprings resort, that'll be interesting. Really annoy hardcore SBQ attackers by tossing one in the mix when the queen is grounded. Lob one straight up and see just how good your armor stands up to it. Go to the top of Garahan mining company and send one to each point of the compass.
---
Golf outfit and golf skirts are money.  Like 25 caps each and they don’t really weigh all that much.   Downstairs room at Whitesprings and there’s 5-6 of them.  Usually a couple more in the back locker room where the wendigo hangs out.  
---
"THE STEAM CODE ISN'T MADE OF ACTUAL STEAM!"
---
I’ll invite you to the Xbox club 
---
They have the animation for it but that would mean that you'd have to stand still for an unknown amount of time while another player, presumably not friendly at all, will nuke you while you're smoking one. I just don't think that it's really needed. Besides, I don't think any Fallout game prior has a player that smokes at all. 
---
You can enter your login information in the .ini file. It's not encrypted but if you have people browsing config files on your PC I think you have bigger problems.

I will look into it definitely.  I just do not want to do anything related to this that could jeopardize any future account.  That's all I was trying to say.  Also, my post is more about getting Bethesda to be both consistent and give better explanations of their banning.
---
Raiders vendors. I picked it up yesterday from the Top of the World train station vendor. It's not always in stock.
---
Hoot would want to buy them anyways?
---
For the most part you're correct; but occasionally the daily or weekly challenges require you to take over a specific workshop location. 
---
Hence the fact I even encountered and found out about this as I haven't touched workshops since they were originally nerfed production wise.
---
Not only not getting any rare mask is bad enough but coming close second is the morons who rush towards the end to kill the stupid mega sloth who by the way only drops rubbish legendary’s.
---
In the meantime a robot or two are lost because the fools hunched over the sloth corpse miss the final mobs (wolves und sting wings) who run in to attack the robots.
---
I am so tired of this idiocy - focus on the bloody robot not stupid sloth...
---
Little bit of column A and B, those who played said they enjoyed it for a bit but it lost its luster after a while.
---
Those problems might be because bethesda got a giveaway event for elder scrolls online morrowind for PC.  
---
Server problems connecting to servers while serverhopping started when a few people said they could not log into their accounts to redeem the code 1 hour after it was posted.  
---
Just take a break, remember good times and play something else until the servers come online again.
---
I'm pretty sure non-related Morrowind promotion tanked one of their services and this is just fallout from it. 
---
"Fuck you we have your money already"
---
That’s a good idea to look at my weapons and armor and base it off of that! I was definitely wondering about the gold, silver, and copper so thank you for that as well. 
---
I really appreciate your input thank you so much!!
---
well right now the servers are for me the worst part, you cant really play at all if you get kicked constantly
---
also, it seems they just make more and more bugs with each one they try to fix, very frustrating
---
they also fix anything that has to do with the ATOM store immediately, but the most requested/complained about bugs they seem to just leave in
---
ive defended Bethesda on this game so much, but the last few weeks its really gone downhill
---
they really need to fix workshop pvp as now anyone can troll you  by finding you out in the world and kill you, they dont even have to be at the workshop1!?!?!?
---
you know what, dont even get me started, i dont have the time
---
I like fighting them and I hunt them for the plans they drop. 
---
Also after entering and exiting Power Armor. Also the Grognak axe is very difficult to keep equipped.
---
I was wondering why my gatling laser was unequipping... Especially annoying, since the gun forgets which core it had loaded when I pull it back up... 
---
Sell or trade it to other players.
---
Always hittin' a combo of them shrooms and that Nukashine lean while lickin' dem toads.
---
That's the serum isnt it? Not the plan to craft the serum.
---
Thanks appreciate it and it is useful because I’m always looking at character building lol
---
Hey I have a growing crew that lately has been focused on the queen. We killed her 5 times last night. I'm mayday91088 if you wanna join in. 
---
More like please let me have a nuka cola machine door in my house
---
What they did was very nice, but in many ways they ruined the game for you. Now everything you find is going to be second rate to what you already have.
---
I didn't knowthe Beret was that rare. I got in in my 3rd ir 4th run. Never hot it since though.
---
You like PVP so much, why don't you take one for the challenge each session? Open yourself up to other exploiters like yourself? They do opt you in to PVP after all. Isn't that the argument? It would come to you. You guys don't take them because you know the system is faulted in the contestors', and you're not into PVP or a challenge as much as you are into easy caps. 
---
Serums will run you just under 4K from the enclave.  The recipes, the plans to craft them, are 17K-19K depending on charisma and perks.
---
LOL.  You go right ahead with that.  Its liable to be several hours before I return. :)  Take a nap on one of the beds, and play the piano while your waiting.
---
Lol, I thought the same thing. Like ok, my place isn't the newest, but we don't need to make things ugly for me to believe I could live there. hahahahahah
---
Have 5 of them not rare
---
Even worse when said legendaries give you a syringer or drill
---
Im lvl 230 now and just started collecting all the rare outfits maybe a month ago. Server hopping for rare plans. Doing events and farming legendarys. Recently i started doing the daily and weekly quests on 2 characters, so i don’t have to buy atoms if there’s something cool i want to have. I farmed the behemoth for a couple days. Kill - loot - server hop - repeat. Unlocked so many Weapon/Armor mods by this way. There’s just so much to do in this game. 
---
Last email I got about it, they reckoned somewhere around June. 
---
For people with genuine requests for support not whining about an account that violated the rules and is now banned for violating rules.
---
I drop ammo, armor and any weapons I happen to have at the church in flatwoods or the overseers camp every time I log on. Sometimes I drop duplicate plans as well. I dont use many energy weapons and dont bother with pipe weapons. I drop aid items but not the stuff I use. Right now I'm about to start gathering caps like a mad man so I'll be dropping the stuff I scavenge more often. I dont trade as I dont carry anything I wont be using so if ya see me dont bother. 
---
That's true. I find this style rewarding to me. But you may get 1490 from your TSE Dragon, but you said that's in stealth. 1300 is me without stealth, so it's 2600 in stealth along with my bays critical going higher. Unyielding armor gets me around 30 perception so I can vats long range. I have a TSE Dragon but demo 5 no longer gets me the damage I want, so I went Bloodied. 
---
you sure it isnt stuff like nerd rage and the dodge perk and stuff? i thought the same (even see their hp go down) but it instantly springs back up, learned its just crappy way of visualising the perks.
---
my last 3 star enemy dropped me a 3 star item, i may just be lucky. it was an Explosive Assassin's Dragon with +1 perception.
---
I agree. When I see a bloodied build trying to pvp me, I think "awesome easy caps"
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1110235368673210368?s=20
---
They've confirmed we won't get it for free on steam :(
---
Sorry, I meant no offense. Just wanted to clarify it for anyone who might be new or to maybe find a cap stash I didn't know about.
---
People would farm the queen if she had a  guaranteed 3* drop... Right now it's such a waste of time... Last fight I used like 40 stims, died 4 times, spent like 10 ultracite cores and we killed her with less than 1 minute remaining. Also broke one of my gatling lasers. 
---
I got a 1* Suppressor's shotgun.
---
Just... No. 
---
Yeah looks like glitches a bit and delays dropping the brown bag. But looks like this is making the bags always appear. 
---
Careful. I tend to give intruders a dragon blast to the face, and that's if I'm not carrying my fatman by chance. Too many online losers attacking me. 
---
Yeah of course DLCs are free, how else are they going to justify charging money for a broken games dlc? And no I did not let reviews creat an opinion about something that is obviously broken. Ive played it and did not even get beyond level three before the dam game currupted my friends game save. So no its not a biast opinion its from experience of trying for 5 hours of tring to get pass the broken errors and crashes we had when we played it. Dude been there done that. 
---
I usually capture settlements and leave everything unlocked so others can take stuff at will without having to capture.  The other day some guy attacked me immediately after I had finished setting up the settlement, complete with my sign blueprint that says "Feel free to take some resources - They're unlocked".
---
I am recovering from clinical depression I've had my entire life and have just started treatment a few weeks ago.  Before treatment, this kind of thing would have enraged me.
---
My new response was to switch to another server and find some newbie and give them a ton of plans I had already learned.  Then I walked Faschnacht(sp?) and did it for the first time, getting an owl mask I love.
---
Good people are great.
---
Better than getting another owl or witch at least something different
---
what is the big deal doing this? can't you just logout and log in to another server?
---
Since they said the account would be unbanned when duping was patched and the patch notes say duping was patched in both patch 6 and 7, it is a legit request for information and to unban like they stated.
---
Why you so mad ? because im right that the game was huge failure ? :D
---
With the MIRV attachment on it and the right perks, it would sure be a fun weapon to mess around with
---
Well, sure. But then there's the random spawns, the possibility of a scorchbeast passing by. Grahm the vendor and his MooMoo. Plus there's the whole fast travel actually making the size unimportant If you have enough caps in your pocket. The game's as much fun as you want to make it. Either you make it enjoyable or it'll annoy you. I've got a game, that apparently is awesome, which after I tried,  simply didn't interest me. But it still made great sale numbers. I've  played maybe 2 hours of it max. While out there someone will be in the 100's of hours played. Different expectations, and tastes I guess.
---
Yes, same problem. Can't invite people to group up as well.  
---
But it only "gets stuck" at one or two players.
---
hmm, suppose i could make a macro to jump repeatedly on the bed for a few hours.  that'd be a better AFK than crouched in portajohn.
---
An RPG based on RNG loot is always frustrating, like current WoW. I just hope the legendary vendor is worth waiting for. In the meantime I do pretty well with a 1\*Bloodied Meathook that deals 1,5k damage without nukashine and an 1\*Instigating Dragon which hits for 2,4k in sneak. I mean bloodied builds are not for everybody, buts it's your best chance at doing "decent" damage without playing the whitespring lottery. The second best option is to find a decent forum and trade with other players.
---
500
---
I’ve had the weapon swap bug since release if that’s what you’re talking about. So many times I go to switch to my melee weapon and get my fists. 
---
You do not really want that if your team is attacked by someone for PVP (if you own a workshop, say). That is why on team or auto just your teammates can hear you. All of your team would have to individually set their chats to area to be heard by everyone around, but then you could not hear them if you weren't in proximity. 
---
I personally want an Armor Piercing Instigating Two-Shot Combat Shotgun, or a Quad Instigating Two-Shot Pump Action. I'm getting a seni just thinking about it.
---
Ive got one. Threw a mirv on it. Its magical
---
But no
---
Ammo is expensive and heavy and I swear it doesnt kill anything at high levels.
---
But I'm rocking it during the parade!
---
Thanks for posting 
---
Tough love : I'm with your parents, don't come back, to the game, or the house. 
---
but still not rare at all, also got 2-3 berets ;(
---
Holy fucking shit
---
This almost makes me wish I was around back when my college supposedly had a coke problem. The potheads here just blast loud music, but hearing raptor screeches every once in a while would have at least been interesting
---
&gt; occasionally the daily or weekly challenges require you to take over a specific workshop location.
---
Ahh, okay. I gotcha.  I never really look at the challenges.  A lot of them are mundane tasks that  I usually end up completing just by playing the game and doing my daily grinding haha. 
---
&gt;Maybe picking up junk that you think is something valuable, only to find a pack full of rotten meat when you sober up
---
This doesnt sound fun or interesting, it sounds annoying.
---
As a former heroin addict/dealer, I can both vouch for and renounce this statement.
---
So you’re admitting you didn’t even get to level three and you’re attempting to make a review? I’m level 142 with over 400 hours in. You’re level 2 with almost zero experience. 
---
Then you just said bethesda is charging full amounts for dlc on a broken game (which has been dramatically improved since launch by the way, you would know if you actually played it) so you can probably see why I take zero advice or listen to someone like you. 
---
The problem with 76 is people like you. Gamestop reviews are riddled with false reviews just like yours, “owned less than a week” “1 star” 
---
You haven’t logged any time on the game and you’re trying to review it. 
---
Good point. Although we rarely participate in PvP. 
---
Hey, the cheaters in the dev room got to use them
---
Exactly! There’s so much to do that eventually you’ll organically find that thing you love to do (or maybe not, then just move on to the next game). I personally started like you, collecting power armor til I had enough cool full suits and would show off my collection to newbs at vault 76. Started being a bro while I was there greeting newbs and began giving out resources I had too much of. On the side, I would tinker with camp building and watch guide videos on how to build cooler structures. Learned how to build round buildings and that was that, I was hooked. So I started collecting building plans like a madman. I could never keep enough caps cause I always found plans I needed to buy. I now have most building plans and have been perfecting a store camp for about a month where I just give away or sell plans I have duplicates of. 
---
Then I got so hooked on being a shop keeper that that’s all I do now. Fucking manage a shop. I still do workshop takeovers to build inventory and will buy dirt cheap duplicate plans from others to trade or give away later. It’s so pointless, but so fun in a weird way. I have a shop window that I sit behind, in a chair on a desk to be at the right level with the customers. While sitting in the chair, I can turn on the radio and tv I have next to me, can activate the mothman statue on the customers side, blow the alpine horn on the customers side (once to signal the buyer and three times for a successful complete transaction), and can activate the siren on top of the house to bring customers in. All from my command center. It’s so stupid but so fun. No reviews talk about this aspect of the game. And if they did at launch, I don’t think I would have bought it, who wants a shopkeeping simulator. Not me, but that’s where I am currently and I have so much damn fun with it! 
---
how do?  I launch through Steam and would love to know how to do this, thanks!
---
1. Go to Poseidon Power Plant
---
2. Go around and up one of the stairs on the left, outside
---
3. Look for a small portable trailer
---
4. Collect Hazmat Suit inside
---
5. **Always keep it in your inventory for just such an emergency**
---
The monorail down by the tower mansions has one at the end of the line before the gap. If you catch a blast zone there is sometimes a bloodied fat man on the legendaries and there is sometimes one that drops at west tek off the legendary super mutant
---
The dragon is a last-ditch weapon for me.
---
I usually use a conventional rifle with a suppressor.  I stay in stealth and can pop their heads off all day long while perched invisible (chameleon) on top of a streetlight.  They never figure out what's going on.  
---
To tell you the truth, my armor is simply to give me more carry weight (my strength is only 1) and to give me fall damage protection.  I'm not even sure if it's leather or what.
---
Yes, I love it! There are speed bumps, but that’s like. For me the pros outweigh the cons by far 
---
But then everyone would be fucked by the cult of the mothman
---
check your loot probably. but yeah, sometimes I accept switch to offers only as I have no business and... nothing Damn dude what you want lol 
---
We sort of have that with mr fuzzy tokens, except people just duped all the costumes and masks instead :/
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one bothered by that phrasing lol. People say it wrong ALL THE TIME
---
It WAS bad.  
---
It is getting better appearently. BUT expect some bugs, be patient and get friends to play with to keep you at ease. \^\^  
---
That seems like a odd phrase. Twinking in gaming is general used to describe intentionally staying at a low level while min/maxing at that level.
---
Ive just always known it as transferring items, and the extra character being labeled as a mule.
---
Right.
---
I feel like you did this lol
---
Should be able to get I about 1900 caps with hard bargain 3 and grape mentats.  
---
If you play on ps4, I am more than willing to help transfer stuff. I have 3 characters and know this struggle all too well.
---
Just pointing out the wording of what was posted and is pretty clear they said all Zenimax products which includes ESO. So yes it is a contradictory message since ESO allows add-ons. All I'm saying is they better clarify exactly what games they are talking about and not use such vague blanket wording.
---
Sorry everyone I didn’t even knew prime weapon were a thing!
---
You said you felt what your son did was wrong/a bad idea.
---
Then you tried to justify what he did by saying he never actually duped or exploited.
---
Your son indirectly participated in a very well known exploit. 
---
I also have some concern that you allowed your son to play 200 hours of a game in the first 3 months when he apparently is young enough that he needs to be shielded from reddit. 
---
That said, Bethesda said they would unban the accounts, they did not say when that would happen. Yes, Bethesda has a support site and team and I am glad that team is prioritizing tickets submitted by players who didn't choose to exploit over the ones complaining about how their ban was unfair and asking when they will be unbanned. Sorry, I guess the right phrase is suspended. 
---
TBH, Bethesda let exploiters off easy here. Most games it would have been a permanent ban. 
---
This is your opportunity to teach your son a life lesson and be a good role model for him. Instead you are on reddit complaining about how his time-out has been too long. 
---
10-20 years from now you will be complaining about how your son's generation is "so entitled" and refuses to accept the consequences of their actions. Hopefully every time you do, you'll remember this moment. 
---
My boyfriend has the old man mask. He got it the first time he played the event 
---
My favorite has been the drifter outfit with red bandanna, wraparound goggles and black cowboy hat https://imgur.com/a/GaiBNp1...
---
But I did rock the pristine miner uniform with yellow miner helmet for a long time!
---
&gt;I got all my assassains and cavalier armor ready to go.
---
I'm half expecting that to be nerfed. And that doesn't necessarily mean nerfing the armor. It could be don by  by buffing anti-armor perks and weapons.  
---
Not saying for certain that it will happen,  but I wouldn't put it past Bethesda.  That's why I am waiting until a long while after the Beta phase to even touch survival. It's hard to imagine that re-balancing won't happen, and I don't want to make a build just to have it nerfed. 
---
Seems to be rare for some players. I only have 2 but about 10 of everything else
---
There was no arms there , just legs :-(
---
My calling card is an orbital strike. Really lets them know someone was there
---
Me too. I'll even sleep every other day if I'm in the middle of something I want to get finished. Which has been since I got the game pretty much. Now we're getting new content? My life is forfeit. They should start employing Game Masters so I can get paid to play the game.
---
Its a ban
---
Bethesda nerfed the ammount of loot the legendaries drop after so many whined about the game needing more content and not being hard enough after the YouTube asshats farmed the shit out of white springs. It was a stupid move. They should have just kicked the players doing that shit. Sounds harsh but I havent got ANY decent loot sense the nerf. Then they nerfed the explosive weapons cause people were throwing a fit about one shot kills and people not being able to group up  in the blast zones, claiming people were not sharing the loot. Had they not been farming for hours on end it wouldent have been an issue but it's the players more than anything that have keep the game on the edge of ruin sense it came out. True fallout players dont do that crap, only the call of duty and fortnight rejects. 
---
Like I said I know the difference between a reward and a participation trophy but you just keep backing up my previous claim. You think just because someone grinds the event they should have a better % chance of obtaining a rare item over someone who doesn’t grind the event. That like I have said is entitlement and shows that you think people should be rewarded for participation.
---
Just by grinding a event doesn’t make you earn something over someone who doesn’t grind the event. Plus you also state the vast majority wouldn’t grind the event anyway even if it was guaranteed at say 100 times, that is also like saying the vast majority of people who play the game probably aren’t members of this subreddit so I bet there are more masks out there then people realize. 
---
So by you saying that everyone who did hundreds of runs should be considered receiving a mask then isn’t that you saying that everyone who did hundreds of runs should be entitled to a mask. Your words not mine. 
---
It is mostly like a ton of entitled kids saying “I want my mask because I have sunk hours into the event”  that’s exactly what all these posts are people who feel entitled because they have sunk hours and hours into the event. 
---
I’m for transparency, I hope they do release the numbers. 
---
Ohhhh nooooo my original post have people down voting me, shit it’s the end of the world for me how am I ever going to continue with life because random people on Reddit don’t agree with me, sarcasm by the way, I could give two fucks about upvotes or downvotes. Also hypocrite much because all of a sudden your the voice of everyone who has a problem with the mask drop rate. 
---
Want to grief, Go over to survival mode and grief.
---
Brokers are served, you’re not a banner. 
---
Me either, too many wendigos that need killing.
---
We've had a dozen other threads on this today.
---
Did he screenshot the event rewards pop up showing it as a drop?
---
I’ve never seen it before wow
---
I have encountered far more good people in my travels than dbags.  
---
I would submit a ticket. At one point, quest items intended for other players were just rendered invisible instead of non-lootable, so people ended up with inventories full of literally nothing. Your situation sounds similar, and I think they only patched future occurrences, not existing ones.
---
God damn wood armor 
---
I actually want this but I wouldn't want it to be 1:1 I would want it to be 1:2 or 1:3 in break down, also ammo types would matter in how much you would get back because some ammo is more common then others.
---
Bloodied combat rifle with a Hasty .38 receiver. I call it the Hasty Tasty .38
---
It'll be worth more in a few months when the supply has completely dried up.
---
Can we please have new perkcards or something that allow for cat/dog companions?
---
If they die they respawn at your CAMP. AFTER I BURN YOUR CAMP TO THE GROUND AND YOU'RE TRIPPING OVER MY PULSE GRENADES YOU EVIL FUCK.
---
They should variable them as to "mostly attack while flying" and "mostly attack melee" as well as "mostly spawn mobs".  
---
Then things would change up a bit, you'd have to adapt to them.  
---
All in all, they are annoying to fight when they do not work as intended.   
---
Remember them saying the beasts would stop shrieking more frequently? Ya ...  
---
Oh there was one other thing I wanted to bring up, still I think it has limited uses and I haven't tried it myself so maybe its garbadge.
---
The cryolator, I'm told it drains all AP when you get hit.  (so makes dodgy not work anymore and also vats)  I'm thinking of trying that out as a backup weapon for such situations, have you experienced this at all?
---
Alright when can I cast a pole and pull in a mutated monster! 
---
Congrats. I have 40+ masks and no beret

Yeah, the 2 days it did not work after patch 3 were the only 2 days I've not played. 
---
Do you have any spare plans? I will buy them off you. 
---
I've said this before and I'll say it again - not one of these guys using this current exploit would ever take a workshop for the challenge of being on the owner side of this battle because they know how broken the mechanic is. If you did it to see how good you were, you'd take the munitions factory or a power plant or both and and play until "raiders" came to challenge you. But you know you'd die, so it's a big nope from you. 
---
ITT We learn what TIL means today
---
Totally agree. I was gifted a 2 shot explosive lever action and used it as my last resort weapon when I got overwhelmed but then it was nerfed and now a base gauss rifle does more damage. Had the YouTube losers not farmed so much and posted their stupidity, this would not have been an issue
---
sounds awesome to me. You wanna get shitty on drugs? There's a price to pay. I like role playing games... there's enough "meta build" games out there already. 
---
Man don't play Warframe then you'll die
---
Very well done, the green accent lights really enhance the mood.
---
I've always tried to be a helpful person. It just comes naturally I guess lol. If you're on ps4 friend me, my online id is the same as on here. I usually don't mind teaming up or just helping with something really quick. I can also make decent sets of armor and weapons, missing a few plans though, especially for like robot armor and the other high tier. I can make all of the heavy leather though, and that stuff has ridiculous DR.
---
Thats just like yesterdays dilemma. I was busy looting junk at Artkos Pharma while I had a lvl 89 female trying to slap kill me with a combat knife. I ran all the way to the roof and she kept following me trying to kill me so I decided to jump off the 4 story Artkos Pharma building, killing me on impact. Luckily Where I re-spawned at I was literally next to my paper bag where I had dropped my loot.
---
Looks like a mackerel. In freshwater. Totally unplayable.
---
Wrong. First thing i do is take the shop next to my camp. Then i use the system to hunt players. 
---
Its not an exploit
---
How do they get back to the same server?
---
Sure thing. You may not need four-leaf with crit savvy as it only gives you a little boost. Cannibal is just for fun and being gross. 
---
There's always next year.
---
They can take the feedback regarding the drop rate and re-evaluate, then make it better next time around, it's a seasonal event after all.
---
Looks great 
---
I just got the beret too! It was my first solo completion of the parade too! ✨
---
I'll test it tonight on my guy, he just hit level 55 and still needs the quest. If I can get them to spawn I will tell you how I did it.
---
Ah, for sure. Thanks!
---
thanks!  does it go in the regular ini or prefs?
---
Cannibal is definitely fun lol
---
If it wasn't that rare, hardcore players would farm all the masks day 1 and just not give a damn. At least it kept me doing that parade over and over. Sucks I didn't get any of the rare masks but it would have been so awesome if I did. and that kind of anticipation makes people keep playing
---
Oh cool the pve crowd suggesting changes to pvp again...
---
This sub is 1% pvp. Bethesda dont listen to things upvoted here.
---
I'm on satellite internet, so bases sometimes load really slowly, piece by piece. Often I'll just be able to walk through a wall or jump up a floor because for me it's not there. 
---
One time I hopped up a floor and the guy said, "What the FUCK." And I was all, "yo can I borrow a cup of sugar?" and he logged out cause he thought I was going to grief I'm sure. 😂
---
It'd have to super rare.
---
Higher with blackpowder. But, flipside... need more misfires with black powder.
---
They are pretty easy once you get nice gear. I shot this after the tse nerf but before they made them easier because of whiners [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7km3qIhHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7km3qIhHg)
---
I get it every now and then. have been for the past month, not often, but since purchase, for sure.
---
It should definitely just behave like it does the first time you use it in the vault. I have no idea why it would behave properly to begin with and then go all ridiculous afterwards.
---
What in gods name are you building with that?
---
Only speaking from experience haha
---
Join a friend.
---
That happens right now? Or this is an idea of yours?
---
They are there, usually covered up by murky water. The fish actually loads in before the water. You can't interact with it at all. It will actually disappear depending on your viewpoint.
---
Buddy; I'm fine with PvP. If you want to duke it out in my workshop that's fine.
---
But you stepping your little toe into my workshop, then traveling to my camp or even worse a public event where PvP is normally disabled to kill me by gaming the system? That's where I draw the line on the difference between actual PvP and trying to grief someone.
---
That's been in there for at least a month.  Never really checked before that so can't say with 100% certainty 
---
Meh, I'm still a little iffy lol. The trade interface is there for a reason!
---
I never tried to justify, I simply said what happened.
---
The amount of hours may not be entirely correct.  Even so, 90 days with 2 hours a day is not a lot.  I had twice as much time and I work 60+ hours a week.
---
Bethesda did say the account would be unbanned and stated that would happen when they patched the duping.  They stated duping was patched.
---
They let some actual dupers as well as people having multiples of obviously duped weapons/armor off without anything.  They simply lost all but one of the items.
---
I am not complaining about the "time out" as you call it being long.  I am complaining that there is not response from Bethesda.
---
I'm the one on here complaining about the inconsistent banning policies of Bethesda and lack of communication.  I'm not sure how that has to do with what my son is doing in 10-20 years.
---
I was scrolling though replies, and stumbled upon this https://twitter.com/byKanonymous/status/1110231181625384962 .
---
So i think it's safe to say it's a no? 
---
Ammo
---
I too got 5 Jester mask on the first day.  So easy!
---
Put them in cash registers at vendors, that's a pretty common spot, or drop them in a bag next to a stash box at a vendor location so they'll be seen.
---
I used to stay up an extra night when there was that span of time where servers didn't put in new players. Couldn't help myself taking all the workshops in a server alone for 14+ hours haha
---
You're completely ignoring my point about them releasing single player games, that aren't out yet, on Steam and instead picking the one battle you can win, which just happens to be an offhand quip at the end of my comment that's completely irrelevant to the point.
---
This would be a much more engaging battle than what we have now. Which is me cursing at them when they're in the air and then laughing like a bloodthirsty maniac when they land.
---
lol?
---
Thanks, I will totally not use it, especially no with the mininukes dropped by the suicider super mutants that attack the parade.
---
The fixed a lot of them during the Wild Appalachia patch. Give them time, they have done everything they said they would do. Honestly, it doesn't happen often and it doesn't break the game, so I wouldn't expect it to be high on anyone's priority list.
---
Ok wow sounds like doomsday prep lol
---
I’ve got the Beret on ps4 so pm me if interested 
---
How do I download the PC version? Morrowind was my very first Bethesda game.
---
Huh...the Bethesda Launcher never nags me for my password.
---
They probably should unban it like they said but my point is they don't have to unban anyone. Unbanning anyone is their choice and you are trying to make them out to be the bad person saying "they don't care as long as they have your money" (this is why you are getting bombarded with downvotes). If I were them I wouldn't unban anyone related to duping it has made a mess of this game in more ways than one.
---
Your son has violated the terms of service by partaking in an exploit and you should be happy with Bethesda that they even considered unbanning him because they don't have to. 
---
I'm sure they will unban it anyways it is probably taking more time than usual for other reasons such as the new report feature is probably keeping them extremely busy.
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
"I personally demand..."

Your name is Karen, you've got on Ombre bobcut, and you always want to speak to the manager.

I don't PvP but I like it the way it is. I think it is the right balance between risk and reward and changing the PvP boundries would mitigate a lot of that risk.
---
Thanks for the idea but no thanks.
---
Step 1: Travel to Whitespring Station
---
Step 2: Equip level 3 Hard Bargain Perk
---
Step 3: Consume Grape Mentats (and any other charismatic chems you may possess)
---
Step 4: Purchase metal building plans for less than 1900 caps
---
Step 5: Enjoy
---
 I'm pretty sure all the rare ones will be for sale for atoms some time after March 26th.
---
No, and while I prefer not using PA, if someone else wants to live in theirs that's their choice and that really shouldn't bother you.
---
&gt;and then laughing like a bloodthirsty maniac when they land.

---
Lol i mean i need 500-1000. I craft ammo and try to triple the profit. 
---
Put a hazmat suit on your favs. 
---
Awesome, thanks for the easing of mind. I definitely want those perks!
---
I'm a mix. I was heavy/rifles. TSE shotguns and quad Explosive double barrels were very desirable, so I switched. The nerf happened so I went back Heavy/rifles. And now that I'm using rifles and no longer in PA the entire time I can play as a Union Soldier with Blackpowder weapons. Kinda fun to roleplay. I hit hard, quick, and retreat if they don't hit the ground first.
---
Only real use I found is getting onto Watoga medical centre roof without having to go through the building. There's some loot up there and chance for legendary just inside the door
---
That and I think the strength "buff" is actually a debuff when your strength is maxed. I can have nothing but an outfit on and still lose 5-10 lbs of max carry capacity when I jump in PA
---
I disagree. 
---
Its nice the we are both entitled to our own opinions isnt it?
---
So i will continue doing that kind of thing guiltfree. For me, it isnt about "muh salt" im not into making people feel bad. 
---
I expect every player to know the system and how it works. If they feel "griefed" its on them. If anything i taught them a little lesson they can then benefit from in the future. 
---
So ill keep using the system as it is. You can posture and have some ethical concern with it but it wont change the fact that raiders are out hunting workshop owners. 
---
I think awareness is the most important aspect. We need players to knpw this *can* happen, so eveyone enjoys their time in the game. 
---
- Buddy
---
Encore, encore!
---
I'll check my stomach next time I log in, there always seems to be some there.
---
Haha! I will be sure to include that. :)
---
Okay. So right above it. You could do your base there and still reach the junk mode. I've done it lol.
---
Indded, better someone getting it than remaining forever forgotten on that vendor at least. 
---
Cheers!
---
If you're doing it alone, I agree, it's not. If you're having a teammate contest while standing next to an unknowing workshop owner to kill and then repeat to farm for caps, it certainly is. And I apologize for wrongly grouping you with those fellas if I have. 
---
Er. That went out in left field pretty quick.
---
With the ridiculous rise of the prices of all the good stuff, what's wrong with everyone getting caps easier? I don't agree that the game has to be as grindy as it is for no good reason.
---
After a while, when you have most of your wanted perks. Don’t spend the level ups each time you level up.
---
Can you can re-spec many quickly
---
doesnt bother me. i can hate something that doesn't bother me
---
Yes I do? You're not me lol.
---
People who say Fallout 4 or 76 have assets lifted from Skyrim are just like people who claim Fallout 4 still has glitches from Morrowind, they say it frequently, but never seem to have or bother to provide any damn proof
---
For people who wanna use it on steam, you know you can launch the game directly thru steam if you add the .exe as a nonsteam game
---
No there’s plenty I like
---
I'm super sneaky with a 20 agility. I'm much a more accurate shot with a 20 perception. My vendor prices are great with a 20 charisma. ect... 
---
I put together a full set of bolstering armor but it was nothing compared to my set of unyeilding. 
---
That’s what happens rn 
---
Sorry meant for someone else
---
Tomorrow when the Survival Mode comes out i think all the people are gonna see just how broken as hell the system is.   It's litterally gonna be everyone running around with chameleon and bloody builds.  power fisting and mole miner gauntling everything that moves.
---
So let me get this straight; you honestly think killing someone in a server wide event where PvP is normally disabled and prevented is fair game just because they had a workshop?
---
Ammo sells for good? Honestly I just dump it on the ground. Having 2k in random ammo suck. Who the f need 500 cannon balls. Me I guess cause my dumb ass picks up more
---
I am currently using a shotgun/vats/crit build, and I love it. I can solo literally everything but the SBQ with no PA.
---
Im those fellas. I use a team
---
We are *raiders*.  Were the bad guys. Im not your team mate. Im not trying to rebuild appalacia. Im trying to look out for me and mine by taking things from you. 
---
Ill take whatever advantage i can get. Thank you for your comment though . i disagree.
---
My location I meet the Lemonade guy is actually just south of Lady Janet's Soft Serve (much easier)
---
Do you actually read what you type or?
---
Exit the elevator and go directly across the hall to the barracks room. It will be on the bed straight in to the left.
---
Leave that room and go to the end of the hall. Left is the bathroom and shower. There can possibly be one on the shower bench.
---
Leave the lavatory and go across the hall to the other barracks. the 2nd bed to the right can also possibly have one.
---
Good luck! You'll need it!
---
This game is a nice guy goldmine, especially in the evenings.  
---
The past few days I have played has been a really great experience.  Two very nice guys on separate occasions helped me complete quests, level up, and helped me build a camp!  I think the most valuable part of teaming up with a more experienced player is being able to ask questions and be able to see what higher level's daily experience actually look like.   It feels even more lonely playing alone after all that help. Thanks to the nice people helping others to enjoy the game.  &lt;3
---
Try the second room on the left, 3rd floor.   Sometimes the first room on the right.
---
Not in a world where I can store my PA in a computer on my arm. And know that my workshop is under attack from across the map.
---
I just love the challenge of staying undetected.  I regularly visit the fissure sites and collect ultracite from the decaying veins.  As long as one of the scorched don't trip over me they never know I was there.  Same for the circling scorch beasts.  They just keep flapping around.
---
For a challenge, I've started moving toward weaker weapons like combat rifles.  Now it takes 3 headshots to take down a lv68 supermutant and they'll all start rushing me after the first two go down.  It's a challenge to put the rest of them down before they reach me.  
---
One downside is that I went through the glassed cavern without even raising a caution and never got my suit of ultracite power armor.  Probably because I left the scorch beast there - sleeping.
---
I have a fish too, actually 2 fish lol
---
Yeah I would like more budget to pack my camp with unnecessary crap
---
I mean no offense but you don’t seem like a PvP player so I’d understand why its not high on your list. I’m not ragging on Bethesda, but it happens a lot more than you’d care to admit so just understand this is a discussion, this isn’t a complaining thread so much as bringing to light certain issues and exploits, thanks!
---
"Punishing people for trading for in game items is not right."
---
"Also, their rules never stated trading for items would result om a ban."
---
"The catch is he never duped."
---
I could go on, but I won't. All of this comes across as you trying to justify it. 
---
Alas, none of this really matters. The one and only fact that matters here is Bethesda will lift the suspension on these accounts when they are ready to do so. They do not owe you or your son any further explanation or response as to when that will occur. That right was forfeited when the TOS was broken. They have already said it will happen when the duping issue is fixed. The scope of what is included in that fix and what they considered fixed is up to them. 
---
 Just be happy they didn't make it a permanent ban. 
---
They pulled a Rockstar console/PC delay with BethLauncher/Steam. I'm not buying it again and I'm not starting over. I like Bethesda games, I cannot stand their launcher (namely b/c it's simply a DRM manager).
---
We did and sent a report to bethesda. I didn’t record though because i have no space on my ps4
---
I've noticed that I'll flactuate between 370 and 400ish when in Excavator armor and I've just come to accept this as a bug.
---
I suspect most will play Survival Mode for all of 30 minutes before they return to Adventure Mode to try and get 'easy' kills.
---
Not being able to track people on the mini-map is going to hinder most of them massively.
---
I suspect it’s not really completely RNG but a relatively small and fixed pool of loot per server. On several occasions I’ve got exactly the same poor loot from different creatures within minutes on the same server. 
---
If it’s truly RNG, what are the odds for me to get two stalker’s hatchets within two minutes, both one-star and from three-star creatures? If it’s completely RNG the chance would be near zero given all the possible combinations of weapons and armors. Yet it has happened to me many times. 
---
Lol depends on the market you have i sell to 6 people. 5mm, shotgun shells, 5.56, amd .50 cal i only craft 5.56 and find the rest and sell you can get 2 for 1
---
I am a heavy trader and I've been running out of room. So I figured if I level my mules up to 15 I can reduce a lot of weight with perk reduction. I try to add people in random games to get way point unlocks. 
---
These two complete strangers accepted and then proceeded to level me. I wasn't using a mic so they just decided to do this on their own accord. They took it a step further and built my mule a house and furnished it! 
---
Needless to say this act of kindness deserved a reward. I traded to see what type of build one of them used, and saw she had an average pump shotgun. (She wasn't bloody build.) I went into my stash and gave her an aae pump shotgun for their unprompted generous act. 
---
I don't think they thought that through on adventure mode. So someone shoots you at the queen and then jumps in front of your gun, now your in pvp xD Do they even play this game?
---
The dude just spawned when I inserted Technical Data at Camp Venture. Followed me a bit, saying the "stop, halt" thing. I then fast traveled to my camp...
---
Yes. I have to reject the event to do it. (Ive done it plenty)
---
I am a bad guy. Jeez why is that so hard to understand. The game has a path for bad guys... Unlike fallout 4 lol
---
But seriously, raiders are bastards. Its part of the game and a legit playstyle imo. Im not losing sleep over it. 
---
You should understand you are never safe if you own a workshop. Awareness is the key!
---
Hahahaha YOU BUM!
---
"balance"
---
PVP is disabled during Fasnacht?  Since when?
---
That's been happening a lot to me recently. If I'm not killed on the first shot I throw the confused look out like "really dude?" Usually they go away.
---
When Bethesda stated that they were leaving steam for their own platform for fo76 they specifically stated that the decision was for fo76 and was no for all titles. That being said, my gut tells me that the non steam launch of fo76 did not pan out well in terms of numbers of titles sold for a AAA game. So they are deciding to launch their new titles with steam to avoid the mistakes of fo76 launch by using the largest PC game distributor with the most audience. Additionally they are taking fo76 which has past it's prime selling period and giving it over to steam. Steam will then run their typical promotional pricing to drive new players that will hopefully result in more atom store sales.
---
It's not that difficult of a strategy to see and a lot of MMORPG titles have followed the same strategy once they have passed their prime selling period.
---
There ya go mate.
---
I do this too. Don't give them too much as it'll rob the fun of the struggle/scavenge . If it's too easy it's just a grind game (high levels back me up here).
---
Seriously. I love the idea that all these Appalachian Wastelanders are running around patting themselves on the back for their newbie care packages when really all they're doing is littering and wasting items they could sell on people's alts. But whatever makes people happy I guess...
---
The servers have been wonky all day, and they're working on it.
---
Random people are getting login issues. Give it time and it should start working
---
300 is what you'd normally be able to carry if you started unarmored and then got into the armor. The extra 100 carry weight is a glitch, which is known about, but as of yet, hasn't been corrected. 
---
It would be nice if melee attackers recoiled off of you on PA, but it already gives quite the stat boost so I understand in terms of balance.
---
While the event is active. Once the quest is complete it's free for all.
---
The immature idiot in me giggles when I hear power fisting. 
---
Vats builds are great dude, you definitely don't want pa for that set up.
---
Go into the start of the launch silos they tend to have a gym loaded up with lead weights
---
Gesh hmm smart
---
I don't believe anything should have less than a 1% chance to drop, especially on a time limited event. 
---
extra hundred pounds if wearing when logging in,good til you exit pa.
---
Good on you. I'm trying to work sneak perk into my deck, I don't see how yet. Too many good perks!
---
The interior at Valley Galleria really gives me the fear for some reason. The tone of the place reminds me a bit of  the dunwich building in F3. 
---
It's more along the lines of, whenever I bulk stuff to go sell, on the selling trip I find I pick up almost as much as I sold. Then I need to drop off technical data, and pick up more junk. Then I'll claim a workshop and defend it, do a quest, then need to sort my junk. 
---
After that I'll go make some food and find I need water, and that trek leads to more Junk. And chems. Chems for days. 
---
75% is a clear exaggeration, but some days it feels like it. 
---
if you need to learn how to build the helmet, scrap salvaged assultron heads, then scrap the junk version of the heads. it is how i learned all 3 of my robot helmets
---
Pretty sure you learn the Assualtron helmet by scrapping scrap assaultron heads.
---
Find Salvaged Assaultron heads (the weapon).  Scrap them to get the Scrap Assaultron Head.  Then scrap that for a chance to learn the Helmet.  May take a few tries.  My friends and I each learned them in about 1-3 tries each.
---
Cool. You the son?
---
Alright, thanks for the heads up
---
The worst is the creatures that spawn INSIDE your house. Showed up to my house once to find my fusion generator and decon shower destroyed. But the outside of the house was pristine.
---
Oh, I never knew that.
---
Hey u/FritoZanzibar,
---
Letting you know that options are being looked into. 
---
&gt; **Request to have something to do with unused ammo.**  
---
&gt;**STATUS:** We are looking into options that will allow players to spend their unused ammo for either caps or other ammo types. We want to be sure any direction we take does not have negative impacts on the economy.

No problem mate I can't play without them as the motion blur does my head in.
---
A George Clooney soundboard.

Where can i find them?

I'm still waiting on my new car!  I'm tired of walking around like a post apocalyptic homocidal Jesus.

If you’re on PC, I can mod all the Prime receivers.

And yeah, I hate taking things on faith. If I think it’s important, I investigate. Big fan of the scientific method, controlling for variables, repeatability.

Seen my post on slap damage testing? ;)

Carebears deatroying the way of the raider everyday. Lame
---
I'm going to try the music one tonight
---
24 perception, 23 agility right now.  I may dump demolition expert and move 4 more points over to agility
---
Okay, i saw a lot of people on my friend list online but if it just targets some people that explains it. Thank you
---
I can kill you during it if i reject it FYI
---
Beret is the real stand out for me.  Screw the unobtainable masks!
---
Duping issues are never fixed in games.  They just get slowed down sometimes.
---
I prefer not to pvp, so I don’t take workshops. I’ve had no issues. 
---
You're on a highway to the danger zone, bud.
---
I'd get as many diseases as possible so they'd just get continuous pops.
---
You've contracted Parasites 
---
You've contracted Radworms
---
You've contracted Shell Shock
---
You've contracted Bones Worms 
---
Doubt it man, but i will try restarting the game. Thanks.
---
You go to the news article on Bethesda.net about the 25th anniversary of Elder Scrolls, and there's a promo code and a link to redeem it. The website is being fucky right now, so it's not working for a lot of people. They're working on it though. 
---
I wouldn't say "perfected"... you could only move 4 items at a time.
---
They really are.
---
Today I’ve tried to 2 one perfect run - giant mask and plan , two robots died - witches mask and a plan 
---
Yes please! I'm known as the dirty diseased whore in my team group (it's not as fun as it sounds, I basically never have disease cures and am constantly diseased with *something*), I'd love to contaminate everyone's stuff with my cooties.
---
Hop on one foot while saying the alphabet backward.  Then face North when the parade starts, and make sure you are facing South when the parade ends.  Each of the robot need to end the event with a 25% HP if they are wearing common masks, and 45% HP if they are wearing rare masks.
---
Then if the Sloth stays alive for more than 10 seconds, and someone is playing music when the Pyre is lit, none of it will matter because it doesn't affect the drop rates at all.
---
This guy gets it! Ill still wreck your house if i find it tho!!
---
Waterworld?
---
The bug is an “extra” 100 if you log in wearing it. If they fix the bug it’ll just be 300 always. 
---
Conversely how can one drop from any height in power armor and not become an indistinguishable reddish pulp inside the suit upon landing?
---
To quote one of my favourite machinima creators 'rules of the Wasteland Codsworth, rules of the Wasteland'.
---
Do you get a Brahmin automatically? I never built one.
---
Would you like a link?
---
NP. When you retry it I'd recommend fully powering down your PS4 just make sure it tries to login again from scratch.
---
Same name?  How does that work?
---
I’m glad.
---
Every major current MMO disagrees with you. 
---
...but if that's the case then I guess it's a permanent ban since it will never be fixed. 
---
There are so many nice people!! I judt hit level 50 and i help whenever i can. Ive met a few mean people Nd some who said they wanted to trade only to find out they wanted 14000 caps for a 2 tap weapon. :( 
---
Watoga theres efficiently 3 or 4 I forget honestly 
---
&gt; I’m wondering if perhaps being drunk on that two minute timer when the event ends might do something 
---
If you want some feedback from an event grinding person- There were some drunk event challenges to complete where I used the event, and I'm over encumbered using whiskey and other alcohols during the end of event often. I've run it 130-ish times. No rare drops. I've not used nukashine and made minimal use of the new alcohols aside from high-voltage hefe, which I used a few times at the end.
---
Go to Watoga and kill the Assaultrons there.  Helps if you have done the Mayor for a Day quest, and you can get up behind them and shoot them in the Combat Inhibitor multiple times before they can respond.
---
Large enemies (Deathclaws, Sloths, etc.) can sometimes drop the Salvaged Head weapons.  So can the regular protectrons around Watoga.
---
If I wasn’t such a cheapskate I would’ve awarded you gold for this comment. Unfortunately those funds are going towards the purchase of a new keyboard to replace the one I spewed Coke Zero on while laughing. 
---
Do these drop in that order? 
---
I did the quest a few times and managed to get BOS Knight, BOS Knight CPT and BOS Knight SGT. 
---
In that order. I really want that paladin one
---
I did this but it makes my game lose sound and I have no idea why.
---
We do disagree. I think you are a plague akin to dupers, using the system in a way that it can be used but for which it was not designed (Bethesda stated why they made the change - to stop uncontestable workshops), lessening the experience of other players for your own gain. But life goes on even in the face of so-called "raiders." Thanks for still taking workshops. I think it's nice you stick your neck out a little bit, too. 
---
Or just have a chance for our water purifiers to get clogged with fish. Or let us build fish farms. 
---
There are lots of nice people on 76 that do things for others .. there just a few bad apples that cause players not to want to be around another .. i placed a home next to the event from day 1 for all to use then yesterday some dick greafied it while i was afk like wtf
---
Broad strokes indicting those of us who actually saved all those tokens.   
---
Got 2 legendary wood armor parts today wood I'm lucky,going to turn myself into a tree.
---
Anti armour dragon is pretty op. I have one, not selling 
---
Maybe not, but at least it’s something new to do while farming a repetitive quest for an item w/ a .003% drop rate.
---
I see what you did there :)
---
There are a lot of nice people on 76. I am on my 3rd character (different builds to see which i like best) on my highest char which is lvl 80 i always find low lvl people and give them plans i already know for differnt things like weapons and armor to help them out. I also keep a lot of purfied water on my char so i can drop some for low lvl players to help them stay hydrated. When i started my 2nd char i had a high level person give me a bunch of plans and purified water as well as ammo. To pay it forward my 2nd char is melee build so i also give my extra ammo to low lvl players because i don't need it but i still collect it for that very reason.
---
Well thank you too. I appreciate the civility. Im always honest about my my raider ways. People usually call me a dick or whatever.
---
I like to spread awareness of what we do. Im not happy about pacifism extending to camps in the future tbh
---
This
---
Hey, no shame in being #4.
---
There are times where I either fat-finger the “close trade” button by mistake when I’m trying to change menus or go back from selecting an item. This usually results in swearing and restarting the trade
---
Half of the time when I do the Fasnacht, there's always some dickhead that goes around shooting\hitting people. There's also been several times even I'm just walking around and happen by sometimes camp and they just come out and attack me. Oh, and the other day when someone came into my camp and started destroying stuff.
---
Just saying YMMV.
---
That's what I do, the cons for that are someone got them and waste of caps fsst traveling. Working on walkable route with minimal cap use
---
nope
---
High Voltage Hefe is what I used when I tried it on Friday, but I only did it once.  I’m more curious about Nuka Shine, tbh.
---
This solved the issue, thanks!
---
Lol after they already trapped everyone into their launcher and got the full $60 and no refunds. 
---
Servers are glitchy but the game is fun. It's definitely more fun as a team than solo. II really like it personally, but my husband hated it. 
---
Ofc more nerfs are coming cause people cry about everything all the time
---
Butt_ermybr3ad. I'm normally down to do anything. I often help lower levels out, known to drop nukes, or just go scorch beast hunting. Got a pretty awesome camp. 
---
I've said it before: the parade is a pagan ritual paying tribute to the RNG god in the hopes that you will eventually get better loot. 
---
But it looks like it takes more than protecting some robots and lighting a bonfire to win his favor. 
---
Guess it must’ve resolved itself when leaving j joining a new server 
---
Or i server hop a silp because they have most weights, then Charleston, then green country, and finally vault tec
---
Maybe let us bulk and sell it to vendors, that way they can set the price really low as it's common. Players buy shotgun shells on the market if you want a flip. The problem I have with lead being so easy is the lead/steel market is decent money for farmers.
---
I have also completed the event several times on different alcoholic beverages due to challenges, same old drops every time. Also have not used nukashine though.
---
Because of the challenges my characters are either drunk or suffering withdrawals from alcohol addiction &amp; neither one has made any difference to the drops for me.
---
I also stuffed myself with the Fasnacht donuts during the event but no difference.
---
I wish we could of seen a video of their adventures after drinking the 'shine.
---
Awesome! Im goin to add you! I'm Sgt__Lucas 
---
That particular method has been fixed. But I think there's as many people looking for dupe methods as there are developers looking to fix them. 
---
Excellent, glad to help :)
---
Pretty cool! Im goin to add you also! I'm Sgt__Lucas
---
Good to know about the donuts.  That was one thing I was going to try tonight.
---
Most, 90% of the people I meet and trade with are cool as shit.
---
Thats good!
---
That is a killer weapon 
---
I have a one start Hunter Explosive Dragon and it’s pretty decent. 
---
Try it any way, you never know it may work for a sober person.
---
Level 265 here. Other than farming plastic for shotgun shells and searching for an elusive bloodied explosive double barrel shotgun, that's pretty much all I do.
---
It feels good to just go full Hoarders on my stash every now and then and toss a bunch of crap. My friends say I poop legendaries bc I'm constantly dropping them but what else can I do? I have max caps and no stash space, why keep them? Now if only I could stop hoarding plastic and shotgun shells for absolutely no reason...
---
23 perception and 28 agility. 27 perception and 32 agility if on a team from herd mentality. My Bloodshed Dragon is 1283, and TSE is 1104, then TSE drops to 979 with demo 5 instead of Nerd rage 3. Demo 5 is trash anymore, and only works for explosive weapons rather than all like nerd rage's +20% damage to all weapons at low health.
---
Nice! I’m level 172 and finally trusted someone to trade for the first time ever (glitches scared me)
---
Ended up getting like 20 plans I didn’t even know existed!! Haha it was great. I haven’t played in so long and it’s great out there in the wasteland 
---
I like that! We could do a whole aquaponics thing.
---
They bringing servers offline tomorrow and patching again 
---
Oh yes please my ps4 is is sprintracing 
---
Looking into the future pose had been missing since last patch 
---
The latest Inside the Vault said that survival mode will have its own weekly challenges that are supposed to be harder compared to the adventure mode ones. They will also reward you with unique legendary weapons if you can complete them. No mention of daily challenges though, so who knows what those will be mixed or not.
---
Someone did extensive testing and confirmed slap damage at the current patch is 5 damage per second, no more. Don't know what you are experiencing, but bloodied isn't doing any extra slap than a normal build.
---
Starting a new character full on trying to resettle maybe flatwoods or another peaceful town 
---
Elite: Dangerous did it just fine although it took a couple months..
---
Done, thanks
---
Well if you bought it for Xbox, do you expect to play it on Playstation for free?
---
Full assasains gear ?
---
I had this happen to me twice in the same game, not happened since. 
---
Im sure they'll be and that's gonna suck for the people who don't partake in pvp. It would be pretty cool to have different challenges depending on the mode you choose.
---
as a general rule of thumb, sell things for slightly more than you'd get from selling to a vendor, but a good amount less than what it costs to buy from the vendor. Ballistic fiber is one of the most expensive materials and it goes for about 7 each, whereas steel goes for 1 cap a piece (if you cant sell it to a vendor it usually goes for very cheap, another example being ammo)
---
You must have meant "snipe them with the missile launcher". 🤔
---
It allows the possibility of more people purchasing the game which in the long run is the important thing.
---
You'd be surprised what people will buy on the market. I usually sell stuff at price or below and that gets trade done quickly. Holding onto a item you don't need because of greed, hoarding, is a common mistake, just let it go. I vendor guns and chems, sometimes stimpacks if I have too many.
---
Berry mentats.
---
Its just berry mentats being used by someone you are in an event with. Should have no effect on the rewards received at the end. 
---
I mostly agree. Alchol challenges tried to promote the new content but they were still a private event that could be done by anyone in the game.  Now pvp challenges would't be private and they would be locked out to all the people that will never touch survival.
---
Let alone pvp challenges could be easily trivialized by having willing friends.
---
Nope, didn’t take any
---
One of the mentats, I think Berry, gives you the detect life effect ( the pink mist ).
---
Nice, thanks :D
---
Great idea! I'd like to be the new Delbert, giving cooking lessons
---
I have friends that drive tanks.  
---
They say things running into you and bullets is no big deal. 
---
However if you get hit by an RPG. The magnitude of the explosion will shake the tank so hard that you will have to shovel out the tank driver.  
---
They usually get the next tank driver to shovel out the guy before him. I’m not joking 
---
Odd, it went away after the robots were dead
---
Agreed, which I addressed. I still think it’s just very weird timing is all. We’ve had no word about it coming to Steam and all of a sudden it is when Bethesda is in a bad place. 
---
I somehow made it to level 70 something ( casual player since game release) without ever being on a team. Friday night at Whitesprings trying out the glow sight perk on some green glowing globby ghouls I get asked to team up with some folks that after a minute or so of chatting I realized knew a heck more than I and helped me tremendously. Now I know, being on a team for events or in a nuke zone makes the game So much more fun
---
Same happens to me, they’ll want my Mr. Fuzzy costume or TSE 3* Tesla and when I decline they’ll love tap me with a bloodied melee weapon 
---
Clem!
---
Oh wait this isn't warframe
---
Bethesda really has improved this game a lot since the launch and it keeps getting better. They patched all the major bugs and glitches and now are focusing on new content. If you stopped playing because of the issues that this game had back when it came out i can tell you that they have fixed 90% of the problems it had. I can join a server now and stay on the same server for hours without disconnection or lag.....unless someone nukes whitesprings lol.
---
Hey man, trades aren’t very common on this sub. I would hit up r/Market76 for a better audience!
---
My efforts weren't 100% solo. During the tail end of the first scorchbeast, I turned around and saw someone in power armor leaping down from a higher venue. 100+. It happened so fast I didn't catch a name or get to chat. Not sure how long they were there. My guess is they were nearby when things got hot. Maybe they were planning to take it over, and instead helped with the defense. I appreciate that they didn't just gank my character for an anti-climatic event. I've had enough of that in other games. Sometimes I just want to get into the game.
---
Prob just coincidence. I use it all the time during events that require protecting something from enemies. I haven’t been using it at the fasnacht event cause there are so many friendlies and it does the same effect to them as enemies so not as useful in my opinion.
---
I respect your POV, but I’m not referring to policy and how to report it. It’s correct, absolutely so, to state if the person who is griefed or bullied feels as such, than it happened. The griefer/bully cannot, neither can a bystander or witness, say it happened or not. ONLY the person it happens to can, in a game or IRL. 
---
This runs contrary to what a lot of us were raised to believe or what policies state. It’s understandable to think only those conditions apply, however it’s incorrect when talking about a personal experience. 
---
Here comes another witch hunt. Ive personally done more damage with aa weapons woth slap damage then bloodied its still so little damage it shouldnt kill you almost immediately somthing else may be affecting you like poison and burn damage 
---
ya. never said something bothers me 
---
Bloodied Builds require someone to be at 20-30% HP it's a trade off for massive damage and having no HP.
---
I held off on buying it for PC.  Glad I waited.
---
You have to hit it at least once, idk if people know this but it’s complete aids. I help during all of the quest but they destroy the sloth instantly and I can’t get the drops.
---
Easy loot, troll or bored im guessing 
---
1. They're changing it soon so you'll take no slap damage.  
---
2.  You dont need a bloodied build to 1 shot another player. 
---
I find it hard to believe they had no intention of ever bringing it to steam.  It makes more sense business wise.
---
Well, what do you know. First server I checked and it's the pink one, which is the one I wanted the most.
---
That clears things up. Thanks for the info!
---
The owl one fits so perfect with the urban scout armor haha
---
Ran out of time?
---
Did you run out of time?
---
I've never been able to take it out of my stash and have the quest start. Tried dropping it, relogging, eveything I could think of, and it's never worked once for me.
---
Other people seem to be ablento start it at will.
---
West Tek developed the first power armor pre-nuke era, so the BoS “non-frame power armor” cannot be a precursor as BoS was founded after the nukes fell. 
---
One of my biggest goals is to have a well furnished camp that’s not a base but a home, and stuff like this would definitely help! Unfortunately though a lot of the things I want for my house costs atoms, so I’ll have to grind.
---
Didn't look at the time tbh so could have been that. Kinda annoying if it ended right at the end.
---
The Bethesda launcher seemed like their new “next gen” thing tbh. I agree it wasn’t unlikely they would bring it to Steam eventually, but the way they’ve been treating the launcher it seemed like it had a chance of not happening too! 
---
It happens haha
---
Sometimes you see youtubers, like ran into Alexkgb at the event and stabbed him a bunch of times. Sometimes you get a guy blowing up your camp. Other times it's just guys who picked your locks or fell into your trap and think they deserve some kind of payback for the stolen bag. Lots of reasons. Guys with high bounties are caps. Workshops are caps. 
---
Somebody popped Berry mentats Eventually everyone at the event will have it, there's noted problems with the coding for how it works.
---
The answer to your question is in your question. It's your FIRST impression. At least finish the main quest-line before judging the game. Fallout 76 is one of those games that get worse the deeper you go into the end-game. Not to mention that the early and mid-game are at best decent. I can critique every single one of your points but won't because it doesn't really matter.
---
Haha! This guy ^
---
I have a hoarding problem lol. I just cant stand to drop them and let the game eat it hence why I'd give it away for free vs drop them.
---
Does nukashine have a cost?
---
yes please. make it really loud so it echos.
---
The Crosshair. Northern edge of map, maybe 1/3 of the way from left side of map. Random raider armor spawn point. Sever hopping is usually needed to complete a full set though. 
---
Not sure tbh. 
---
I'm on now
---
i think if you had technical data in your stash before starting the bos quest, you cannot use that to trigger the event. maybe try giving it to someone else and then having them hand it back?
---
If you are raider you will go survival. If you are griefer then you prefer to bomb camps of people that don't want PvP. If you are raider, you accept you can be shot on sight by people who don't trust you. As a PvPer, I am happy that camps of my fellow pacifists will not be able to be damaged on adventure servers because that means more overall worldwide satisfaction. I'll go look for my harsh experience to people that actually want to provide it.
---
Underrated comment.
---
The suits are only known as BoS by the time we see them. 
---
Just saying we have two forms of it. Not the placement of when. 
---
Sounds good. I will be on around 1030 EST
---
“It’s bethesda's fault that I broke their ToS, not mine!”
---
That is true as well. There are mechanisms to reduce the effectiveness and overall usefulness of just randomly attacking people, and I do feel most toxic players simply took a pass on 76 for various reasons, but there will always be some.
---
I always rock the civil war Union outfit with the beret. 👌
---
I think its uncommon. Definitely doesn't drop as much as the 5 commo masks. But I assume most people grinding the event will have at least 1 beret.
---
Not sure it's considered rare.  Usually when people refer to the rare drops they are talking about the goblin, sun, jester, skull, and winter masks. 
---
Seems properly rated to me
---
I had the same issue. I made a paper bag by dropping some spoiled meat and then put the technical data in the bag. Picking it up kicked the quest off. People have been reporting issues with this quest recently though so YMMV.
---
yeah im just glad i got it on my first and only try so far
---
You're right, next time I ever see anybody with a rare item I'll assume they got it legitimately instead of one of the thousands of duped copies
---
And you just "know" this was from bloodied builds?
---
Not some exploit, or other reason (workshop/wanted), you were vulnerable to pvp?
---
You know what needs nerfed? Not understsnding how game mechanics work.
---
I get where you're coming from but this seems kind of silly. The issue I am presenting is why couldn't they have just started with Steam? I'm not disagreeing with your comment, but my post is pointing fun at the fact that making the Bethesda launcher was probably not the brightest idea and they could have just started out on Steam in the first place. I probably would have never touched the Bethesda launcher had it not been for 76. 
---
I thought it needed more. I'm glad you're happy.
---
I've never had an issue with honey beasts, just gotta get within melee range and it's dead after 2 or 3 swings. Snallygasters though....
---
Paints from the world like nuka, quantum, BOS, etc all stay when transferred player to player 
---
One quantum. I've only used it a few times.
---
Its not that I dislike the new potion system, I think its pretty interesting. I would, however, trade all of it for canned coffe recipe. Personally its unbeliveable for me that the only thing my character consumes less than me is coffee.
---
People who are unhappy when I lock off certain areas of my camp.
---
Bloodied and below x% health this happens PVPers
---
People who want to buy all my TSEs and Fasnacht Beret when all I want is some .308
---
I need clarification as to the perks and details as to how to upgrade this weapon... Thanks 
---
I believe the intention was that you were supposed to sell it to other players somehow. That's why vendors won't buy it and it's basically useless.
---
IMO, they should change science, science expert, and science master so they also boost energy weapon damage.
---
Dude I made the comment three months ago wow
---
The map marked is glitched for the Uranium Fever Quest market and that is where you go to "Join Event" but in reality it is farther inside BlackWater Mine
---
When I first started playing i had a lvl 44 person attack me i was only lvl 22 at the time so i ran away. He followed and kept shooting at me. He didn't have power armor so i pulled out my frame and jumped into it. After a 5 min fight him shooting me with every thing but the kitchen sink and me with my trusty guitar sword and Sprint power attacking imagine both our suprise when i beat him and he left the server lol. It just goes to show that you will be suprised what you can do at low levels Espically with power armor lol.
---
Was completely working yesterday so I have no idea what happened. 
---
Weird. Maybe attach it to another node and see. It only has to be attached to the power source to work.
---
Nah like health doesn’t drop. Just doesn’t register the hit
---
I get technical data from someone who hasn't started the quest and only some of it works for the quest - maybe half. It's weird, like some of it does not register as the document you need. 
---
That is valid, how about if sleeping for X amount of time reduced the rate of food water depletion by Y% or gave a percentage boost to AP and or AP regen?
---
"you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"
---
I dont believe that's the case at all. I think this is just a bugged event and Bethesda not listening to the community. however...
---
If you plan a week long only event in a game, and there are special triggers to get the most sought after loot, then the responsible thing to do is let the actual player base KNOW ABOUT IT. tease that theres unique ways to unlock special gear. You dont just drop an event and let people figure it out. 
---
These are cosmetic items, not special op guns, but silly cosmetics as a reward for completing an event. There is absolutely no logical reason to enrage your player base by having there be a drop rate this low or not at all. AA  and TSE guns dropping hardly ever fine, they alter game play. But a collectable mask available for 7 days, just bullshit. 
---
Im at 100 hours and still haven’t had any interaction with anyone more than an awkward wave in passing. 
---
We’re prepared 
---
Not worth selling great way to travel I guess seeing as I can't fast travel
---
They reported "earning the mask in a legit manner". Whether their report is true or not, I can't and won't say, but that was one player that did report that they earned the mask in a legit manner. Your original statement didn't say anything about providing any kind of verifiability. That's just you either [moving goal posts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts) or not being clear in your original post, wasting both of our times and failing to support your point. Good job.
---
Thanks ;)
---
You aren't supposed to do that period lets alone more easily. 
---
Rate is fine. No drops after some people competing this event 200 times is not. How in any way would it effect the gameplay if the way they were rewarded was increased. You grind 100 parades you get all masks. You do 10 or 20 you probably dont. Effort=reward. How it is now there is honestly no reward when the most sought after items are unobtainable. 
---
The majority of people I see in the game including myself do stuff like this all the time the community is surprisingly friendly in that game. And active despite what people will want you to think about it.
---
I HAVE THE SHINIEST MEAT BICYCLE!
---
It’s the rarest one actually obtainable 
---
That’s fair, it is a learning experience for them. 
---
&gt;When Bethesda stated that they were leaving steam for their own platform for fo76...
---
Got a link where Bethesda says they were leaving Steam specifically for FO76? Because it wasn’t the first game of theirs to be Bethesda-launcher only...
---
&gt;...and was not for all future titles...
---
Got a link to where they said that, as well?
---
&gt;Ps: if you don't want someone to call you out on your rudeness don't be rude.
---
Sorry, when was I rude?
---
Thank you for this.  It annoys the hell out of me seeing the constant "bloodied builds need to be nerfed" and "dying from 2 hits from bloodied build" posts.  I'm sorry but it can't be done.  Slap damage is exactly what it is.  There's more proof of people showing that slap damage with bloodied builds can't kill someone as compared to those saying it will.  Of course, their defense is "I know what I saw".  I think it's more game mechanics that they may be unfamiliar with.  Thanks for the post. 
---
Nice, I hate him.
---
I've never. 
---
Until Survival comes out, I might give it a go then.
---
Did you read the article though. They said if someone shoots you and you're in pacifist, no damage. But if you shoot back while in pacifist, you enter into full pvp. So like saying at the queen. Someone shoots you then jumps in front of your gun, now you take full damage. It's amazing to me they can have a rule chang like that.
---
Yeah, someone took berry mentats and right now everyone in the area gets the effect (which I hate). We haven't failed to lose a robot when someone has taken these at the parade because people can't make out friendlies from super mutants. Do everyone a favor and don't take berry mentats at Fasnacht. 
---
First and foremost, thanks for the find! (I should have written this in my first comment, but I always tend to forget that this is Reddit and any discussion without some overt indication of courtesy tends to be seen as aggressive.) If you could also source your find for the lore-nerds out there, that would be extra nice.
---
My only objection was to the first sentence in your second paragraph where you mentioned that Recon/BoS armor/underarmor was a precursor to the frame. The frame, assuming that West Tek developed the whole system, was invented before BoS entered the picture.
---
You have done this event over 260 times? 😲
---
Ah - cool idea. I’m out in the boonies so no structures around but that’s a great suggestion.
---
Ohhh that comes out tomorrow? 
---
NPC = false
---
You're not the only one.  I built my base on a cliff next to the downed airliner. 
---
About a quarter of the time I log on I am bathed in the warm orange glow of the nuclear aftermath.  Makes for great pics!
---
Bless you and your kind ;)
---
No karma system here, you're thinking of r/Market76
---
There's the corpse on the tree in the NE side that doesn't fit in with the rest of helvetia.
---
That was me and elconvict doing that. Im not sorry. By the wqy did you notice the flamethrower trap inside my base?
---
np
---
I've lost count of runs, but someone else suggested this before too. And it does make sense. I'd estimate I've done it now about 70 times and about 5 or 6 times I got plans but no masks and there were zero robot deaths. 
---
It's much more logical that those occurrences were meant to be the rarer mask drops but they didnt trigger than the other ideas on drop rates. 
---
I think it's about time they increased the stash limit again so I can fill that with stuff I never use too.... 😐
---
Imagine complaining about judge players telling you your camp sucks, and then immediately whining about players' camps in the same breath. For both 4 \*and\* 5.
---
I've met nothing but nice people so far.  Always have fun teaming up
---
Oh yeah i finally just hit 50 a week or two ago and now anyone thats under like 120 i try and put up a fight with and have absolutely won a couple times, but when theyre 200+ and hit you with a legendary explosive minigun or assault rifle its game over
---
I think I have everything Grahm can offer but I grabbed the starburst clock plan for future trade (or a friend)
---
Holy shit.  Thats a fuckin good point!
---
i didnt pass judgment on them.
---
Ok, so...
---
First... You can't be killed in two hits of slap damage. Not even at level 1. That isn't what happened. You had a workshop. Or you were on a team. Or you were wanted. Bottom line is, you were engaged in PVP and didn't know it. Not entirely your fault, the game doesn't explain the mechanics of PVP much at all. PVPers have been experimenting and learning the system for months and they take advantage of that knowledge gap.
---
Second... there are many ways to one hit someone. Anti armor build. Vats crit build. Instigating weapons. The list is long. Anyone who is built for PVP and knows the mechanics can one hit a player OF ANY LEVEL. It sucks, but thats the way PVP works in this game.
---
I called it a precursor as PA looks really thin in the games and just recent ones has bulk. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recon_armor_(Fallout_3)
---
It’s a wiki but I can’t find the one I saw years ago. 
---
I could be wrong but I remember reading the same stuff in NV not sure on the where abouts. 
---
So many classics are missing from fo76! Maccreadys outfit too!
---
I’ll check it out.
---
Pretty sure with that odds,someone would have dropped one. It must be way way more than that or impossible to get.
---
I managed to do 4 in one hour server hopping. It's possible. 
---
Just to add that I've done the Fasnacht run about 25 times so far and at least twice we had 0/5 robot marchers destroyed and I was rewarded a beret and a plan but no mask. I'm curious if the game in this instance _thinks_ it's giving out a rare mask but then doesn't actually 'drop' the item. 
---
Blackwater Mine, The Gorge Junkyard (locked trailer) 
---
okay but game design isn't about what you like, it's about what makes the game enjoyable. Having to refrain from looting because i took some psycho artificially increases the time i need to spend playing (because i can't remove the drug effect). 
---
Not a fun mechanic, the others you mentioned were interesting though.
---
I tried that and all other variations of it, sadly no luck. Maybe eventually they will fix it.
---
Some of my favorite things to do in this group is help others. I don't let griefers get me down, though. I assume that's what would happen if we were really out in the Wasteland!
---
Yep, except I only drop mine in the blue suitcase at the Whitesprings station.
---
You are a dumbass. Actually read my comments, I was always asking for proof.
---
I want a nuka cola lamp and nuka girl wall hangings for my place. Class up the joint.

Tee hee hee, see you guys in Survival Mode. - Mr. Cannibal Raider Guy
---
For god sake i just bought it a week ago, should have waited more :(
---
Theoretically, they could set up ITEMS servers that are not game servers, thus reducing load on the game servers.
---
They'd still go to the same backend database, but the ITEMS server would be doing nothing but inventory management.
---
I’m currently rocking a casual outfit and fashionable glasses with my beret!
---
Ugh I feel ya, it bigged me enough I just scrapped the damn thing.
---
Bugged*
---
&gt; So yes it is a contradictory message since ESO allows add-ons 
---
Yes the wording uses Zenimax products, which includes also ESO. They don't need to clarify anything, the wording already says what it needs to say- In both games it is not allowed to use **unapproved** third party applications. This doesn't mean that ESO addons are now against rules, it says that **unapproved** addons are against the rule, this means addons that aren't built to accordance to official documentations. This means someone trying to inject addons that isnt built in LUA or inject addon differently than it should, are against the rules. 
---
If Beth now took someones addon for F76 said it is approved to use, you could use it or if they said:"Hey, yes you can build this way addons for F76", these addons would be approved and wouldn't be against the ToS.
---
Also idle animations...
---
That can't happen
---
lol no. Just trolling reddit
---
It gets kinda of the end game after a while lol
---
Well I have a lot of plans and masks to sell next year when new players want them, or so that's what I tell myself to keep justifying don't the event lol.
---
It's still fun even if it's a grind
---
Thats the point
---
i have my camp on the cliffs above cliffwatch.
---
love my little concrete base against the wall so i can get inside but no one else can unless i open it up for them :).
---
Can’t wait to have you dead 
---
there were Nuka cola cherry paints for all armors in the fo4 Creation Club, so I'm kinda surprised nothing out of the creation club has made it over to fo76 (i can understand community made stuff, but half of the stuff on there was just made by Bethesda)
---
My name it’s um...

Guy
---
Uh

Guy R Bailey.

Yeah that’s my name

Let it go, people. It’s a cosmetic item of no intrinsic value.

Unyielding sentinel is highly duped and easily defeated. Other sets, like weightless sentinel, unyielding cavalier, unyielding blocker, etc haven't been duped nearly as often.
---
Hi! Thanks for the tags and for your report. Sorry I missed this the first time around (my inbox has been a bit cluttered). Will make sure we have eyes on this internally.
---
your name is incredibly accurate.
---
Paints are purely cosmetic in 76. I guarantee you this. 
---
what if Xbox has like 2nd store, that was not so popular and you first had to buy it from there and now it comes to original xbox store where most of your friends and games are, how about then?

Survival isn’t meant to be let’s all play nice.

I want all the STASH boxes while in CAMP to be separate, for proper organization purposes. The actual STASH box (that you see at train stations) can still function as is, but all the foot lockers and boxes and dressers (STASH ones) should all be separate storages WHILE IN YOUR CAMP. Any time you check a STASH box at a train station or Red Rocket, or even in a friends CAMP, it is to function as it already does. 
---
Im just tired of pointlessly placing different containers simply as aesthetics and not functionality. I really want to organize my belongings and id really rather not have to sort through EVERYTHING, EVERYTIME.
---
End rant/idea.
---
Is that a bug? I thought my pc was just crap. I see them quite often.
---
Thanks!  Will be on later!
---
Thats the number floating around. Theres also rumors of others getting these masks. No pics from what ive seen. 
---
Any tips to spawning it or is it just completely random? I know about the specific spawn points but I was just wondering if there was something to increase the chances of this specific one appearing. If the rare masks are anything to go off of then I'm going to say no lol
---
Are you dumb? I dont mind not having one, what I mind is fake content. No one has provided proof of any of these claims and so you are just another "he said she said" case. Sorry of I dont believe you when no one else on the internet has one either.
---
sounds like **no**
---
Makes sense. 
---
That all escalated quickly. I agree with the original point here. Just tell us something please. 
---
At this point I’d prob just stay on my second account anyway but I’d still like to know what’s going on with my main. 
---
It's not about the item. It's the principle of the matter here. You advertise an event for a limited time in a game with rare loot to encourage people to dedicate their time to grinding and then dont reward it? 
---
If pvp mode comes out and they promise unique legendary weapons and then only allow half of them to be obtainable would you say the same thing? 
---
Well a couple things:
---
1: Love the dedication and data to back this all up
---
2: I've thought the event was bugged from the first couple days (Never even seen a mask on anyone out of 100 runs) and all the accounts of seeing it are from secondary sources (I saw someone else with it, never themselves)
---
3:Regardless of what the actual drop rates are, if they are glitched, if everything is in fact from the dev room, Beth will say the drop rate was intentional and how they planned.  With this type of limited event they'll save face to not continually seem incompetent when it comes to game balance and coding. 
---
4: Don't worry and have some Hard lemonade at the top of the world.
---
Thats the problem. Now I carry 3 with me and can't tell the difference between my T60 BOS and my excavator.
---
Someone datamined the event and none of that factors on. The only changing variable is that more bots surviving slightly increases the chance that you get a mask.

Combat shirt and boots with the beret and a black bandana ❤️
---
I was in the same world standing in the same spot with a friend who it showed offline. For then it said I was in the same world but we couldn't actually see eachother.
---
I've done the put it in a container trick and while the quest doesnt trigger, I can still deposit it and get the quest completed to trigger. Its bugged but sometimes works that way.
---
Reasons why it didn't launch on steam...
---
&gt;Steam refunds
---
They knew their game is garbage and people would have refunded on Steam.
---
Man I feel broken
---
I have been instant killed by players, but I'm sure it was because of the workshop. It annoys me beyond that it is easier to blame the unknown than attempt to understand it. I, as a bloodied build, can one shot in PvE but also can be killed in one shot. If anything, bloodied builds are weak, if not fair.

JT616 on xbox
---
No sweat, it was actually my fault. If I tag more than 3 people at once, the antispam filter picks it up and doesn't send out notifications. I just figured this out today, and changed it to only tagging 2 of you in each comment :) 
---
Thank you for getting back to me. I sincerely hope that its just a mistake, and Ballistic Bock is supposed to work with heavy weapons. 
---
Me too, buddy... me too.
---
I actually did that a while back. It seemed to help for a while, but the problem came back. I should check the .ini, maybe a patch blew away my changes. 
---
100% couldn’t agree more.
---
Sadly you are for sure always gunna have atleast one guy tell you: “you can’t just call yourself a raider to cover being a d**k” 
---
Someone vendored one. I promptly bought it. 
---
I guess you could call it a bug or glitch when the water doesn't load in fast enough.
---
i have also ran this over 200 times and noticed no mask on no robot death runs. good theory 
---
It remembers my username, never the password, so I have to paste it in every reboot. One once in a while the game itself will wig out, and I get the password screen in there, too. 
---
Yeah I leave spare plans and ammo there too - just wondered if they didnt appear to others
---
Lol yeah i have not been attacked by anyone that high level thankfully but i would not even try when they are the high level they have probably mattered their build and likely have weapons that would allow them to give the sb queen a run for her money solo lol
---
&gt;It’s the rarest one actually obtainable
---
Yeah I agree.  The Beret is what I would call "rare." What Bethesda calls rare is not rare- but ridiculously rare to the point where there's legit reason to question if they even exist. 
---
That isn’t fat on the Raiders, that’s muscle. Real tough to chew through.
---
Transmat firing.
---
Still 😲 I have managed an entire 6! 
---
Dibs on the liver!
---
It does, but I never run dodgy. I need my AP and I carry a bunch of AP restore aid. Kind of a limited use
---
His hat is kinda there. 
---
8/10... need more lämp
---
65 times. 
---
Well 66 now 
---
I am running 4 accounts at once for this quest, in a control test, with variables (stats, completion, etc) I can control.
---
Sitting on one server as I do work, with a timer set every 20 minutes to check in, and every 50 minutes for the event.
---
Hey bud, they know what the saw, and it's all bloodied builds fault they are op plz nerf. They don't understand game mechanics, it's all bloodied's faults though. Lol, OP jumped on the "bashwagon".
---
Any specific level?
---
Just to conclude this soul-crushing experience - totally self-inflicted, no one forced me to turn a fun and goofy event into a five day long grind fest  - I did three runs today - sitting at 163 runs x 4 now, can't stomach any more - with one toon taking advantage of a glitched mechanic that allows for unintended stat boosts sitting at 50 CHR/LCK.
---
I had the same result on one occasion. All robots unharmed, mask and plan on two toons, mask and beret on the third and just a plan on the high CHR/LCK one.
---
On the bright side I have unlocked all the available plans for all the toons and seeded various servers with the leftovers.
---
I hope someone has found joy upon encountering the Old Man Effigy plan in random suitcases.
---
Absolutely true.  The problem I think is too many people aren't aware of how workshops work.  It makes you subject to pvp.  I run bloodied as well.  All I can do is hope that if I'm engaging in PVP, I can close the gap before they off me with their 2 shot explosive weapons.  That's the price we pay.  Massive up front damage at the expense of long range negatives.  It's a fair trade. 
---
Man this is exactly the data / info / confirmation I was hoping to get
---
Wish I had grabbed the clean white ski suit from the atom shop before it disappeared. I think that might go nicely with the beret. The dirty one you can find probs not so much.
---
I always try and help out lower levels.  Will craft em armor sets and weapons to make sure they're maximizing their effectiveness at their level. I remember how hard and frustrating the lower levels could be sometimes. 
---
Haters just gonna review bomb the game bad idea to release on steam 
---
I'm not the only one, good to know!
---
This. If I had the choice early on to buy between Steam and Bethesda, it would be Steam. The thing is we didn’t. 
---
Donuts and beret felt like what the rare drops should have been like... Maybe half as often
---
Fisherman, can confirm. Unless player tears have made the water that salty.
---
The only thing with being a good Samaritan that would be a problem are Smurfs. Although rare, they'll use your kindness to their advantage and maybe even turn on you. I'm not telling you guys not to be kind, but if noobs look sketchy, don't go out of your way to help them, unless if they ask for it, at that point it's your decision.
---
Bloodied cavalier disagrees.
---
New PvP mode will be hilarious when all participants join after they empty their caps junks and aids, it will be a penniless crowd’s melee fight (ammo is too costly when there’s no guarantee for rewards) over nothing 😂 
---
The sad truth LUL
---
Highest. So 45 or 50?
---
They do have mods that boost damage 
---
Leave server try again. Otherwise the picture kind of looks like its clipping the top of the extractor. Could be a problem. It's not quite clear though.
---
Try the bomber jacket + patrolman sunglasses
---
I haven’t experienced it used on me or tried it. But cryo grenades have the same effect and are pretty effective so I imagine a cryolater would also be effective, in certain situations.
---
I guarantee you the reason they are seeing a spike in disconnects is the Fasnacht related crap.  I’m guessing that a large amount of people are server hopping to play it over again or collect masks. 
---
Besthesda did a good job to recover several weeks ago (server stability) but it looks 
---
1) Thanks... 
---
2) Agree... Wanted to prove/disprove, hence why I am doing this
---
3) Can't comment, but not saying you're wrong.
---
4) what did you spike it with?
---
I have yet to get the donut recipe. I will weep in my common masks. 
---
I would, but then again I'm not looking for rare items.  I find enjoyment from other mechanics of the game like C.A.M.P. building and exploring. 
---
I realized that with my first play through, when it dawned on me I'd be stuck with a level 10 perfect storm. I agree The all rise is the only weapon worth leveling up for but its kind of nice to have a high level stand fast and last bastion. I'd also throw in levelong up so I'd have a level 50 ultracite PA and only have to male 1 excavator armor. 
---
It sucks damage wise but is none the lesson extremely satisfying
---
I want to appalachian antiques, I went south to the random encounter spawn point and server hopped when he wasn’t there(after taking any random encounter goodies) 
---
It's the principle of the thing...
---
100% on point.
---
I have long range from unyielding armor. I'm good on all fronts. Just fragile.
---
Burn him burn him!!!
---
can the bomber only be gotten from the atomic shop or is it on the map aswell?
---
I wish people were mostly this nice instead they kill me t-bag me then take my junk all because i accidently hit them
---
I got 🍩 on my first run.  Didn't they were rare.
---
He's mentioning that you remove mods because you fall through the map and die. That's how you lose junk and it applies only to those on PC running mods. If you're losing stuff on PS4, that's something entirely different unrelated to what OP is talking about.
---
Ha! I was looking at black powder weaponry information a while back. Apparently they popped off unintentionally quite a bit in the heat of solid firing sessions. Due to a glowing ember still being present when new gunpowder being put into the barrel. Most injuries occurred when the act of tamping down the gunpowder. It is something that should've come in the game I think. Devastating damage weapon, with a 30% of blowing apart each shot would make it a last resort choice.
---
Efficient thread title.
---
I completed it?
---
I agree ^  I sold all my masks to a vendor for like 2 caps each.  None of them were rare mind so don't panic!
---
All my weapons are semi-auto and I use rifleman perks, so wasn't sure if it was worth it or not, I'll give it a go next time  I'm on. I've also been thinking of making my FE Handmade into a full auto. Right now it's setup with a suppressor and LR-NV Scope.  Scope was for giggles, see what it was like as I had 3 mods for it in my stash. Probably gonna swap back to reflex sight. 
---
Folks are screaming "PROOF" to players who have the mask.
---
How about showing me proof you ran the event that many times.
---
Dammit they got me. Should have known they would cave and put it on Steam within a year.
---
Has anyone tried scrapping the beret to see if you get the plan for it?
---
Did it occur to you he may have been engaged in behavior you were not aware of? Like, if he duped himself or engaged in mass purchases of Nuka cola quantum or grape (I have heard this was a thing duper’s had, I don’t know for sure)?
---
He may be lying to you out of shame or fear. 
---
That’s right, hide your pain from the wastes.
---
I clicked it. Not bad.
---
If you went after a bounty and died, that's your own fault. 
---
Steam reviews is known to be haven of haters. Dont do it Bethsheda. 
---
I have to farm for crap enough already, I will not be doing it for donuts.
---
Speaking of ammo, does anyone want to trade rounds. I have 3000 5mm rounds and I need .44 rounds.
---
I got beret on my first run too. Didn't know they were rare. Donut took about 10 but I have everything now......except, well you know.
---
I'm assuming you're trying to get the new paint plans. Have you been able to get more then two a day if you gotten any yet? I can't seem to get more plans after getting two and was wondering if you're experiencing the same thing.
---
Yes.  
---
That’s the point.  
---
Can’t wait. 
---
This would ultimately mean the stash space is increased to 1000+1500x1(4-number of alt toons used) because people could then just change other toons into extra stash space. 
---
Instead of this I want there to be 2-3 slots in a "mail" system. Put 2 or 3 items in the mail and any of your toons can access those items. People will still be able to transfer over shitloads of stuff, but it'll be a hassle for someone who wants to abuse the system and people who just want to trade some guns/armor to an alt won't have any issue with it.
---
I only say this method over simple shared stash space because one it seems easier to implement. Two, it feels like Bethesda is trying their best to reduce the amount of people using a bunch of mules so perhaps this idea is more likely to get implemented for that reason as well.
---
He did cheat. He knowingly purchased items he was warned (by you) were the result of exploits. So, yeah. Don’t know what to tell you. 
---
I got the donut plan for some kind sole who dropped it after the event.
---
I have to admit, I really enjoyed that part of the event— creepy and cultish, I would repeat aloud like a real good weirdo should.
---
I'm gonna get on later and help sum noobs
---
I’ll check how many I’ve got tomorrow and get back to you! I have the mining helmet so I’m happy and I was saving for the suit but I’m gonna give up haha and I’ll give them to a happy home (you!).
---
If I don’t get back to you please message me because my memory is terrible!
---
Well, I actually agree with you on this one
---
Anyone know where to find cooking oil??still can’t find it. 
---
For my pistol build I use a bloodied grognak’s axe.
---
Pistols are too underpowered to be considered a build.  I started as a pistol build then became rifle then heavy guns and now melee.  
---
GT UPSTANDINGsecretraiderGUY
---
Thanks for the reply. I’ve already tried that. I should’ve added that into my post. I’ve edited to reflect it now
---
I see it as a bait and switch. They promise something and then deliver something else. 
---
I mean, that makes perfect sense, RPG are design to penetrate armor plating, so yeah the passengers will be shovel out of the tank unfortunately, but I am talking about punching a tank.
---
Certainly is a possibility.  The purpose of this post was because I cannt get a response from Bethesda.  that is what I am asking for.
---
I just want a method to transfer a single weapon or piece of armor from one character to another.   Whatever works and doesn't cause stability issues is fine with me. 
---
They screwed anyone banned, wrongfully or otherwise(especially in wording it as a suspension). And by the time they unban anyone again they'll hope you'll forgotten how angry you were, and be more willing to accept it and just play again. Or just buy a new account (as shady as that practice is). 
---
Also they have no incentive to admit or even talk to anyone about it, all it would do is hurt their PR. So silence on the matter and letting the community witch hunt anyone involved, while unfortunate, is the option their going with. I've already uninstalled. Friend list pretty much now empty anyway, and have no incentive to play if I can't even play with those I want to.
---
Here's a brief tutorial:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8CGdx4nt60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8CGdx4nt60) 
---
Haha awesome 
---
Do you have the extractor in stored tab? Try scrapping it if so. Seriously the amount of camp bugs since launch. Smh
---
200 times is fine. I see some world of warcraft players do siege of orgrimmar runs for over 3000 times and still not get the tusks. People's been grinding for that valentine's day rocket for over a decade and 99% of the population don't have it yet. THAT's called effort. not this 1 week long grind
---
I’ve met this guy in game. He is around level 357 if I remember correctly. I can personally attest for at least 20 or so events I’ve done personally with him, and given that his camp has been located directly adjacent to Helvetia all week, I’m inclined to believe his numbers are accurate. I’ve been playing all week and never seen anyone with a rare or uncommon mask, so that’s really all the proof I need. I ask everyone after the event if they ever SEEN someone with a rare or uncommon mask, and they always say no. Go ahead and read OP’s last post listing all of his collected data if you still don’t believe it.
---
That’s way to long to be a gt
---
I would say perfected. Just like he did, 4 items at a time was plenty and the reason it was so limited was to stop people from just using it as storage rather than a trading mechanism. How frustrating was it to grind out the right perfect item on that game? I remember farming one boss for 50 hours for the right item once, imagine if you got that item... just on the wrong character. That's why it had a trade system. FO4 is much like that, bethesda doesn't want to add in an extra storage system, they seem to want to keep our storage fairly limited. That being the case, if you simply want to trade items 4 at a time seems more than fair.
---
This happened to me on my second event with no robot casualties. So if this theory is true, then I’m actually just really lucky 🍀 Is that right?
---
For your crimes I shall have you hung 
---
That's only at workshops and pvp events
---
Mmm... forbidden donut. 
---
Wait, YOU'RE the guy who keeps stretching out across the stall and just kinda drops it wherever it falls?!? Jesus, even my mole rat won't go in there now!
---
That's awesome!
---
Its long gone, and it shouldnt be that convoluted
---
Neither should i have to plop down every chasis to see what armor is on which...
---
But such is life.
---
Rip ultracite power armor 2019-2019, i knew you all of one minute... 
---
...And my t51 nuka cola arm that mysteriously vanished while making x01 armor.
---
I am not screaming anything at anyone.
---
If someone legitimately got the mask good for them, I am truly happy they did.
---
If someone got it from the dev room and they can finally wear it 'in the open' good for them too. I root for Prometheus, not for the corrupt Gods in Olympus.
---
The only thing that concerns me is that I did everything in my power to get them and miserably failed.
---
As opposed to the Reddit kangaroo court I don't think anyone owes me jack shit.
---
Thanks I really appreciate it and for sure I’ll remind you 
---
I think the whole thing should be wrecked after a huge fall along with the occupant 
---
I've been trying to get these ever since I found out they existed, I've gotten Initiate paint twice somehow. First one dropped a month or so ago and second one a few days later, haven't had a paint plan drop since. I do love my bomber jacket though. Really wish it had the BoS insignia on it somewhere...
---
I’m not pulling the trigger. I don’t wear my pastors vestments for nothing. 
---
Says who?
---
Ok I stand corrected, I confused taming and pacifying.  I succeeded in pacifying a scorchbeast, until now I did not know there was a difference.
---
Check your challenges.  One of them lists all the recipes
---
Add me gofukyurslf326
---
I have it
---
Pardon my ignorance but "perk calculator"? What's that exactly
---
It's a possible drop from a BOS quest called: Forbidden Knowledge. You turn over technical data on Camp Venture. It requires you to have completed Defiance Has Fallen. If you are on PC, I have an extra one i can give to you. 
---
At the cooking station outside Flatwoods' Responder's Bar.
---
In the Kitchen in Helvetia where the Donut Bot (collecting eggs) is.
---
I'm sure plenty of other kitchen/cooking areas have it.
---
Should be noted, it is auto scrapped for components if you do scrap all.  It is Junk, not Aid.
---
I meant to the base damage of the weapon. E.g., a level 45 unmodded laser gun has 44 base damage.  Burning damage doesn't count, and I'm fairly certain the stocks only add bash damage. 
---
I'm not mad over a few masks, i am just mad that they lied by saying that you can get those masks. I wasted a lot of time doing the same event for the same rewards over and over while i could have done other stuff. 
---
It was stored when I shifted my CAMP the first time but when I wouldn’t let me build the extractor I went over to the stored tab and scrapped it. Still no luck.
---
sadly im on xbox but thank you!
---
Switchblade, sub machine gun, suspenders, bowler baseball bat, knuckles, Molotov.
---
I can bearly find legendaries and if i do its gonna be a one star on the odd chance that it's a 3 star it drops 1 star legendaries and in the super rare chance that a 3 star drops a 3 star legendary it's allways a trash legendary for me.
---
Bloodied builds are only really broken when combined with some OP gear affixes and serendipity. What happened to you wasn't slap damage though.
---
I'm right there with you, I use all 5 toons for different builds. I have a two hander, heavy gunner, shotgun, pistol and rifle characters.
---
Buy another copy of the game for "your son"
---
Jesus fucking christ, just stop playing the godamn game if you can’t live with the implemented items and mechanics and stop asking for sense- and useless nerfs!!! This is fucking ridiculous!!! It’s like asking Namco to remove punches from Tekken cause you get hit in the face and you don’t like it! 
---
Lol well that explains why I don’t have it. Thanks got to stop auto scrapping. 
---
"negative effect on the economy" lol, what economy? This is basically a single player game.
---
Yeah being on a team really does make the game much better.
---
If work as intended it should add a new layer of hardcore to the game and I would feel fairly above advantage with semi god equipment lol 
---
Maybe breathe some fresh air into the game who knows it might suck badly 
---
We appreciate the help.
---
Hmm, weird.  Has not happened once for me.
---
He knows 
---
Wear the beret with the Longshoreman Outfit :)
---
Yeah it’s only bash but the game adds it to the per shot damage.  I have all of rifleman mars and bloody mess so 81 is fine being a semi auto with a good rate of fire. The burn is just extra. 
---
Please dupe it. I want
---
I'm well aware of that.  And since obviously you believe that I am talking about my own account, why do't you check my posts yesterday where I trade stuff on Market 76.  I have two accounts of my own.  I play PC.  My son plays Xbox.
---
I’m sorry to hear that.
---
This is also a universe where adding radioactive materials into drinks to enhance flavor is a thing, so it wouldn't surprise me if the cigarettes in game are unfiltered, or had such treatment as well (most of them were exposed to the fallout after all)
---
I know right!
---
Isn’t easier to just ( if really want to play this ) create a new account and move on ?
---
I had given up my fair share of fighting a Corp and it’s pointless at times , sometimes better to just move on ...
---
What do you play on?
---
Actually, Bethesda’s exact words for certain masks were “exceedingly rare”.
---
So you’re not wrong, but I think people forget that those masks were never meant to be obtainable just by grinding. 
---
Something about FEB or do you mean the actual myth?
---
Usually get 1 or 2, but remember that they don’t drop plans you already learned. Don’t turn in that much that I feel I deserve a third drop.
---
Contesting workshops is an intended mechanic. Bethesda said so in the patch notes. Barricading the bench so you can't claim without taking bounty is not an intended mechanic and bordered on exploit abuse. Further, with a 10 cap bounty I lose 20 caps on death. Without a bounty, I lose 140 caps on death. This really only prevented trolls from forcing people into PvP via the bounty system - it did not stop people who deliberately took on PvP
---
Can Two Shot and Assassin's role on the same weapon?  Aren't they both Prefix modifiers?
---
We should but then treating the item as an atom shop item would make as if dropped destroyed ( make it easier on the coding )
---
Don't jump!!! Unless you stored ya junk, than be my guest
---
Not too hard to find this with a little server hopping. And when I say a little, I mean a little.   There's RNG involved, but it's RNG lite. 
---
You may want to use push to talk on both and bind them to different keys.
---
I don't know this game so I don't know if this is possible but you should gain their trust. Then when they're off doing something else steal everything they have and then destroy everything you can't steal...
---
Oh wait this isn't rust, nevermind and good job op. 
---
The puffer ( from that noise it makes with a suppressor lol )

I'm Saberoid lvl 276, but I live in New Zealand so my connection will be crap unless you live in aus/nz.

I'll take the shotty if you don't need it :)

I was gonna say...
---
I wanted to spend hard earned grinded atoms lol 
---
Thanks for the support.  Not sure why my post got downvoted so much except that people think I'm just saying to unban my son.  There are also the people who think I am talking about myself.  My post history on reddit kinda proves otherwise but I guess those people aren't smart enough to check.
---
Really need to try that, thanks!
---
I can't come here anymore seeing so many crybabies. These needs to stop somehow before they turn this game into a Disney ride. Hell, i would gladly pay full price for a copy of a game for each banned crybaby they provide.
---
&gt;Im playing against you, not with you. The game has a path for bad guys... Unlike fallout 4 lol
---
You could lead a raider gang into the commonwealth after nuka world. It took a while, but there was eventually an evil path in fallout 4. But I agree, there should be an evil route. That's been a hallmark in all fallout games since the beginning
---

They were incredibly easy to farm early on. The dailies would reset if you stepped just outside the area of Camden Park and walked back in. A lot of people obtained them that way. Not disputing that they were also duped, it was a lot of work, but there are plenty of legitimately obtained Mr. Fuzzy suits. People also buy the tokens for 5-10 caps a piece which honestly makes getting one rather easy.
---
That story made my day.  I'm in the grinding levels hitch at 90.  I'm too good that lower players don't want to play and trust me. But not as good that the 100+ want me to weaken their team.  After a bunch of trying, I switched over to Division 2 and haven't picked up the game since.  Your story changes my point of view, where I think I will give it another shot.
---
Loading screen says they were the results of FEV experiments.  I believe prior to the experiments that lead to Super Mutants.
---
It deactivate it yes. 
---
I’m so happy to hear that!
---
There are more than a few people who can account for dozens and dozens of the attempts, as they either participated, afk'ed between events in my camp and or BS'ed during the events.  
---
Check my post history, I'm invested in this game working, and succeeding, this is not a troll but an attempt to find if something is broken and get Bethesda to address it. 
---
Sentinel's is arguably the best though. Cavalier requires you to be constantly moving, and blocker requires you to time your blocks or you'll receive normal damage. And I don't even know why you threw weightless in there considering the "Chameleon" legendary effect on one piece throws that all out the window. All the sentinel armor floating around is arguably what's breaking the game right now imho
---
Nick Valentine: Great Hacker, Fantastic Dialogue, Amazing Backstory, and the best style. 
---
And if he chooses to play again by buying a new copy of the game, that is his choice.  It wont change the fact that I will still make an attempt to get a response from Bethesda.
---
You get one hit by people a dozen levels below you BECAUSE LEVELS DON'T FUCKING COUNT. DID YOU READ THAT? LEVELS DON'T MATTER. AFTER LEVEL 50 WE'RE ALL THE SAME
---
Is the game even worth it? I’m not trying to buy a game that can barely get by as a game in alpha development state 
---
You go into your pip boy and reject the event. If you ever see people with white name cards, they rejected the event. You can PvP while the event is active even without using workshop hostility flagging
---
Ok, I should just wait till tomorrow to turn more in then since I already got the next two plans and I don't want to run out of data.
---
Precisely where I drop mine 😀👍
---
Thanks for the support.    
---
Spot on that's me, Thirdstorm is 357 (main).

I set my camp up to help with the wolves that sometimes bug out and massacre the robots before we can respond.

Or maybe a birthday event only for you? You have to find and make certain things to get your "gift"

What about crouching for the chameleon effect but jumping in place? Also what about jumping in place while standing?

This is r/fo76 m8. Any criticism and you receive infinite - karma. Unless your on the high horse of the white knight brigade you ain’t getting no support 💀💀💀 no cap no cap 🚫🧢🚫🧢

The drops are definitely not 100% RNG. When I killed a random spawned 3* enemy with my friend, we both got 3* Furious, swing speed, -weight melees. Mine was Death Tambo and his was Boxing glove. The odds for us getting exact same 3* rolls is next to none. I have also experienced this solo when encountering multiple legendary enemies at once: I got Executioners Power fist and Exterminators Power fist in 5 seconds. These seem to be preset and not RNG imo.
---
They are annoying, They fly and they give me headaches. tbh I can't think of anything positive.
---
Another multi-boxer, good to find another out there!

Think it's worth tagging the community managers at this point?

So you really have to be standing ok. I thought as long as you weren't moving it would work.
---
OMFG let it go I was just making a simple point and the wording is very clear it says ALL 3rd party apps period. Just let it go, my observation did not require any elaborate irrelevant verbose so let it go damn.
---
Couldn't you simply bulk ammo like you do with junk? Say 50 .38s can make a bulk, and that sells for 50 caps?
---
Personally I'm not insinuating the lied, Just suggesting there is an error / problem with the event, because to date I've not been able to find a single confirmed, non-Dev room mask
---
not a terrible idea, but I hate having to carry that thing around. 
---
Just google fallout 76 Graham map. 
---
There's also one in the dried lake in the Southern Forest area. North eastern part of the lake.
---
Fast travel to the area, turn area so you're facing the East and walk 50 feet. You'll be on top of the random encounter location.
---
*Get out of here with your facts!*
---
Vendored it sorry! 
---
Read my other post, my problem is not the lack of reward overall, but the fact if it's working as intended it completely screws the casual player
---
Why don't you read it before posting..

Ummmm yes..
---
It was a sarcasm actually :).
---
I don’t want them to add it in the atom shop, but that how I see it if they would add it.
---
If you look at what what’s available in the shop, its mostly decorative items.
---
But hey if they put it in a quest the better :)!
---
Oh thank god. I already bought it through the Beth launcher, but now we can launch it through steam. Hopefully the steam overlay works. 
---
LoneWolfNoise is my ign, and no problem man. It’s been pretty clear to me you’ve done your homework lol. 
---
It's highly likely that there never was a real Danse and that the synth that escaped had their memory wiped and set up shop in Rivet City 
---
Yeah, I figured. Not complaining ;)
---
I'm fine with that.  I honestly never cared about the masks to be honest.   I'm just saying that there's masks featured in the promotional materials that I have not seen one single person wearing. 
---
Bethesda says that they exist, and I believe them, but I also understand why people would doubt that.  
---
Eh, just revoke the original key... 
---
I thought they worked like fo4 and wanted the old music, not the classical.   I was disappointed when the only juke box was classical. 
---
Nice story! Too many give aways takes some of the challenge away, but that's me. 
---
I actually had 2 people chase me around, egg me on and mock me, and shoot me so I couldn't fast travel away. It ended up being pretty fun, chasing me in whitesprings bunker etc.
---
I did it once. That was enough for me 
---
Wtf is going on here this is trippy
---
Totally agree! It's a risky life as a solo player :/
---
I've seen you!  
---
Let me know at the end if you're missing any plans / recipes etc...  
---
Been hoarding for data until the end, but plan to share the wealth when done
---
I nuked the event last night as well cause the opportunity presented itself, it prematurely ended the event which was just... satisfying.
---
If it makes you feel any better though, its a terrible spot to farm for anything but the raw flux, barely any good mob spawn locations.
---
Yes that happened to me as well, one time last week within minutes I got a Suppressor’s and a Exterminator’s boxing glove. It appears to be a small pool of items per server. 
---
There are people that really are into cosmetics.
---
Who am I to judge if this is the part of the game that really tickles their fancy?
---
Besides there has to be something to it when there is an entire market across many games and platforms sustained - an making a total killing - by cosmetic mtx alone.
---
Besides, as OP point out, is the principle. There was a comment on a completely unrelated thread citing this article:
---
www.phys.org/news/2017-02-animals-unfairly-dont.amp
---
I personally found it... enlightening and I would think applicable here too.
---
Gift me donuts please, for along with rare masks, a donut recipe I do not possess. 
---
Yeah most of the stuff they gave me is just ease of use. The carry weight is a nice bonus and the 10mm is good for just scorched. Right now I can’f even use the power armor.
---
i want different juke box variants that can play any radio station
---
ps4
---
That makes NO sense! They said they had their own launcher for future updates and more control of their software and now it's just "eh screw that, put it on steam"??
---
How did they reset? My camden dailies never even showed up until that patch in january or whenever. I remember seeing many other people saying they had a similar issue. I felt like the general community consensus at the time was that they were essentially unobtainable aside from the few exploits
---
Also, do tokens really go for 5-10 caps each now? Last time I tried trading, the suits were going for many many thousands of caps each. That's assuming anybody would actually sell them, they pretty much always just wanted max level TSEs
---
I mean, most people just run it for the carry weight or jetpack, I know personally, point pleasant is a rather low-level area but can be really frustrating to explore some parts without a jetpack
---
My friend im not making a review im making a comment if you dont like it tell redit not to bring it up my buletin page ok, dont care how many hours you got or if they are paying you to kiss up so much for something incomplete. Thats you bra if you dont like my comments block me. And we can all be happy, you getting ripped off and me playing a normal video game not a corporate cash cow. ✌ with a capital ✌
---
Yeah I just hit the cap recently and I never looked I guess so I didn’t know it even existed. We need more photo space. 
---
I used the spotlighted areas by the crafting tables in Artisan's Corner so it's easy to spot.
---
What platform are you on? I’m on ps4 gamertag is Didney_LaN, would love to see that sometime.
---
For the thrill of the hunt
---
They should have made a single shared stash with 5000 space. They should have made recipes &amp; camps shared(account wide), so I could delete all my toons and start over when ever I want.
---
I will save you the trouble.
---
'We will make sure to pass this on to the devs.'
---
Done.
---
A lot of kids are smoking IRL and a lot of kids icons are smoking too. That's enough.
---
+ you can carry your own cigarettes packs for or purpose anw.
---
thank you so much for confirming this friend! now to waste another 10 hours farming technical data in the enclave bunker...
---
I LOVE wood amour, I have 3 sets. I do not love that \*\*every day\*\* i play, I kill a 3\* and get a 1\* piece of wood armour. If it was 3\*, i'd be really happy, but it's not, it's 1\*. I did AWOL armaments yesterday, I got a 1\* Assassin's Fatman, that's rubbish!
---
Sentinel's isn't the best. When you're not crouched, you can easily be killed by any crit in VATS, and crits ignore sentinels. Cavalier's is just as vulnerable in the same way. Both can be staggered, which also negates their mitigation. Weightless sentinel, however, you can't be targeted in VATS while standing and not moving, so the only way to break through the damage mitigation is through staggers. Chameleon cannot be active while sentinel's or cavalier's is active, so weightless has some utility. Blockers can be used while crouched and moving, so you can't be targeted in VATS and if you're spam blocking there's only a small window you're vulnerable. Blocking counts towards ranged as well as melee damage.
---
Sentinel+assassin isn't arguably the best, it's just the most common. There are only a couple builds it really works well for. If people understood these mechanics and knew they could just crit a sentinel build to death, there would be less people complaining about how broken/unbalanced the game is. You can't complain that the system doesn't work if you don't understand how it works
---
Y’all give Bethesda too much credit for their programming skillz.  
---
I don’t think anything matters, as long as some of the bots survive and the event is completed.  
---
I’ll show myself out 
---
Maybe I've figured part of it out. The terminal does not seem to recognize or work with conduit switches, only wall switches. If there are no wall switch boxes it doesn't complete initialization.
---
I also thought that a terminal would control Nixie tubes but it doesn't seem to recognize them.
---
I farm Watoga every single day for a couple hours usually. I have looted enough wooden armor pieces to rebuild the wasteland 10 times over. I’m level 117 currently and through all the nuke launches. All the Watoga runs. I’ve looted one single weapon, an ultracite explosive laser pistol. Granted the gun is pretty bad ass with my spec, I’d just like to see an increase of useful stuff for my build. 
---
Can do man! I appreciate that, and the help you and your friends have given me with modding/painting my armor. You’re truly a kind vault dweller!
---
I still have one. It's a Vampire's sledge hammer with sharp rocket mods. It's 3 star, and I think one star is swing speed.
---
myth or fallout literal lore.
---
I see, but is there anything beyond that?
---
Amen
---
Did you try to pick one up?
---
So you hate everyone?
---
I’m also not interested in the masks. I’ll wear one while participating in the event, but that’s it. I expect that most people are the same.
---
Personally, I’m glad that there are finally some items that are rare in the literal sense 
---
No problem at all! If you never ask you'll never learn, right? Perk calculators are tools like this https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/
---
that allow you to plan which perks you want to take and which to ignore. I wish I'd found one before I started. I spent quite a few perks early on making a rifle build because that was all I found. That changed the very second I picked up the .50-cal, and was like, "this thing is a keeper!" I had to redo almost my entire perk layout for a heavy gunner build, but if I'd looked at a perk calculator early on, I could've saved myself a lot of headache.
---
Good idea and I miss the NPC’s.
---
I'll give you shells for free. I lost my civil unrest somehow (since we can't fucking lock weapons in the inventory) and never use shotguns anymore. Dunno how to meet up with people though...
---
You’re screaming at the ocean. People will convince themselves they aren’t dicks  and then justify it by “playing a raider.” 
---
Well, raiders didn’t tend to fast travel around a map following you in any past game. They didn’t do things like jump in front of your gun while you’re engaged with scorched/monsters/beasts/etc to “bait” you. They didn’t kill you and stalk you repeatedly. 
---
This is the thing with online gaming. Have to accept it as part of it - some people are dicks. They enjoy being dicks for whatever reason. Maybe they get walked all over at work (brace for “no man I get along with everyone” response). Maybe they’re incels (brace for “my gf or wife is super hot actually” response). Maybe they got targeted early on and are taking revenge on everyone (brace for “nah nobody did that to me u just need to get gud”) response.
---
It doesn’t matter how many people call it griefing. They never will admit it. It’s part of how they troll. I’ve only dealt with one odd instance of it personally. I avoid PvP because people being dicks unnecessarily is why I’ve always avoided online gaming. 
---
Survival mode won’t help. That’s too risky for them. They won’t be able to use exploits to their advantage as much. So yeah. It’s an unfortunate part of the game that isn’t going away. 
---
That was only in FO4.  There is no benefit in FO76 for having the paint job.
---
ive encountered this 3 or 4 times after doing the parade 20 or 30 times total 
---
Marine armor with Union Hat
---
The pic is not me,But he says can pick the masks.
---
Someone found all our missing drops. 
---
&gt; Worth tagging the Community Managers? 
---
Yeah. They've been mostly quiet on the subject though.
---
I'd also love for them to someday confirm/deny charisma and luck affect your chance to get more rare event drops because I'm still unclear on that.
---
&gt;Tomorrow when the Survival Mode comes out i think all the people are gonna see just how broken as hell the system is.
---
Oh yeah. It's  a big part of the reason I'm holding off on putting time and effort into a survival PVP build.  It's hard to imagine that a shitload of "balance changes" aren't coming.   I'm concerned that if I make a PVP build that it will end up nerfed in the coming months. 
---
Do not try and bend the spoon, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no spoon. Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.
---
That's so weird.
---
I would be very much interested in joining! Do you have a discord?
---
Confirmed, thanks!
---
Just so everyone knows, I'll be updating these in batches rather than one at a time, and will be crediting everyone for their contributions.
---
Who the fuck is going to buy fo76 in 2019?  what a stupid idea not letting us transfer to steam
---
Lucky hole mine nets you ~700 lead, but you need acid to smelt it. 
---
You can get a lot of acid from the workshop in the north part of Toxic Valley. It has 3 acid pools you can collect from and build machines to collect more. Also there are more acid pools at the ruined golf course next to the workshop.
---
I'm on PC and over the weekend I saw someone running around with that mask. Only seen it once though.
---
I heard, but not confirmed, that more pieces allow you to remain undetected better.
---
I mean, I play the game all the time and I wouldn't rate it nearly as high as previous fallout games
---
They're atom shop masks but still odd they're not in bags
---
I guess someone does not want this seen!  You cannot find this post on r/fo76 anymore.  Its not in the list when you sort by time posted now.  The post no longer shows that it is posted in r/fo76 either.  Really  [**u/BethesdaGameStudios\_**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_) ?  
---
No, they don't, there are exactly zero things in this game that needs a nerf, and there are certain things where the buff is due.
---
What server? lmao
---
These masks can buy in Atmic shop only.
---
I have two and I always wear one with military fatigues pretending that I am the military escort for the parade!
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snallygaster
---
A donut farm would be amazing. 
---
Ok well if I find one I will report it
---
He's hilarious
---
That's not what i was asking about, but okay.
---
Make it so storing items in their specific storage container(fridge for food and drinks, wardrobe for food, maybe a log pile for wood etc) still connects to the stash but makes that item take less space. That would be pretty cool.
---
he has some plans that only he sells like disco ball , starburst clock ect
---
And sausage.... Gotta use those animal intestines
---
PC unfortunately :( I'm glad you like it though!
---
The trick with him is that you have a friend that holds him and you do "stationary server hopping", where you keep refreshing his stuff and get chance for a rare thingy
---
I'll give you that.
---
I bought a ghoul slayer shishkebab, a vampire grognaxe and a mutant slayers harpoon gun for about 100 each in one world
---
This will just make there be less 3 star enemies. Drop rates are fine and are not supposed to be easy.
---
Hmmm I never see new shit with him. He attened the parade last night
---
There’s a terminal in West Tek that alludes to their creation. Pre War, about the same time as the Grafton Monster. Apparently they’re human. 
---
this
---
Goodluck! Should be a really helpful map when it's all said and done.
---
V2 should contain loot pool data. I'll be sure to take notes during my hunts.
---
Yup, this is what I waited for. Finally gonna give this game a try now!
---
Wow 3 stars? Nice find. If not it sounds like some merchant I unloaded
---
Bethesda has stated that they are different platforms. Given their stance on cross platform in the past, it seems unlikely. However, there’s always hope!
---
It’s a novelty. Not very useful. 
---
I have done it 10 times and got a mask every time.  None rare and several repeats.
---
Harpoon and axe were 2* while shish-ghoul-bab is only a 1
---
Claiming and going over to kill you isnt even the biggest abuse. Theoretically even if they fail the claim they're still hostile so they could just endlessly farm you until they get bored or you hop servers.
---
Meh. If it gets too bad I can just do what everyone else does when they get some bad karma and delete the post. Until then I still will hold to my opinion that Bethesda finally giving up on making money on title sales and hopefully focussing on the atom shop will 1) give us more cool stuff to purchase and 2) generate more money to support dlcs and keep the servers running.
---
is the goblin mask one of the rares if so I just got a drop after this faschnat I will attacha picture
---
What happens in the master of ceremonies gets killed?
---
Rowdy’s where it’s at
---
Shiiit, if you guys find me (Burdseyeflu or VaultedNurse) i always give out the cranberry cobblah! come say hi
---
Players have less than 400 HP normally. Crits ignore all damage mitigation, so you're looking at 2 hits instead of one. Sounds like it's going to be much the same.
---
It’s not really a path so much as a random spawn on most roads. I run up and down the road from Billings homestead to the mothman town and he spawns pretty regularly. 
---
Back up off of Graham! Let him live!
---
Dude ... let’s go I’m hype I haven’t played the game in forever I personally loved it but all my friends ragged it so hard and glitches there levels from the beginning and I got out of it cause they honestly just persuaded me the game was bad ... looking back at it I fucking loved the game and all my friends were pessimistic assholes the games great lmao 😂 
---
This tweet is not me, I don't know,Maybe PS4 or PC.
---
What so you play on?
---
Me, too!
---
Every Bethesda game lacks perfection, has lots of little gaps and rough edges, but surrounding all of that is this... charm. Moments of surprise, even hundreds of hours in. There's always a little discovery waiting for you if you take the time to look. 
---
Their games are about making a world and letting me be in it. Now I'm not just stumbling on interesting locations but other people, too. I hope that future games of their's have a multiplayer component like they've established in FO76 (whether core to the game or an opt-in mode).
---
All your photos are saved as screen captures (on ps4). But that’s no help if you want more than 50 loading screens. 
---
This has happened to me twice on Xbox. Reboot your console it fixed it both times for me. 
---
Source? I don't remember seeing that removed from the drop table.
---
West of the Hunter's Ridge on the road there are two random encounter locations in close proximity to each other. It's mostly crashed satellite/tent/suitcase/etc but civil war bodies are sometimes there. 
---
Charleston station has the well known Vendor bot spawn but on the other side of the pond a little bit is another random spawn that I think some people miss. It can have the civil war people, pretty much the same assortment as the hunter's ridge stuff. 
---
Sunnytop Station has a random spawn on the road to the... umm south or west. If you're going downhill from it that's the wrong direction. It's not very far from the station.
---
Sorry I can't do a picture currently.
---
Omg last light 10 peoe crowded him after the event... And still nothing not even a owl mask lol
---
This is good direction. Guess I’ll start hoarding ammo!
---
You’re still invisible with more armor on. 
---
UH
---
junkie
---
faster reload 15% 
---
increase vats 33%
---
Man it would be epic to see some guy just swinging at shit in the air due to chem usage...
---
I like that it feels really co-operative, too! I can get my competitive PvP fix in other games; here I just want to explore with folks. :)
---
Reminds me of The Fool tarot card's artwork. 
---
[[Link]] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/RWS_Tarot_00_Fool.jpg/330px-RWS_Tarot_00_Fool.jpg)
---
Lol fuck no.
---
I miss the Synth light chest piece. 
---
Hold your tongue, profligate.
---
I should have mentioned that I play on PC.  Rebooting does not help.
---
Which Bethesda rightfully earned, they aren't a victim
---
Oh true. I was gonna try getting one.
---
What about crouching or jumping in place?
---
mentality is fine, I like this game but more consumers don't expect crashes and certain types of bugs are glitches 
---
This makes me love the game that much more!
---
Night before last's SBQ reward was the server disconnecting and rolling us all back to pre-loot state.
---
I’ve had a similar experience as well ! 
---
I found the lemonade stand just a few meters down the road from the oddly creepy Church with the endlessly playing organ in The Mire, just past the section of road with the broken tarmac.
---
I have also encountered other events there like supermutants vs deathclaw etc. 
---
No-one else on the internet? I just told you I met somebody with one. I don't need to ask you back if you're dumb. "Literally no one" is wrong when you've seen pictures of it on this very sub. Do you know what it looks like? If yes: you're talking shit because you've seen it.
---
Even if it's not legit and shouldn't be in players hands that's fine. It either means somebody gonna get banned or means it's still coming. Maybe to anybody that participated in the event. Or maybe as a special reward for something. Or you could just be a dick and call me dumb because you keep saying nobody has something players have seen.
---
That’s a lot of tries. I lost interest in doing this event after about the fifth time, but none of the rare males appealed to me anyway. 
---
Noscope_420bird I got a bloodied radium rifle 
---
U literally have to be standing yes
---
To me, the only thing that works is allowing people to trade ammo at the train station vending machines.
---
If breaking down is allowed than that creates XP farming opportunity.
---
Alternatively, we could achieve the same result as trading at a vending machine by simply converting ammo at a workstation (without XP gain) regardless of the resources on either side of the conversion.  I don’t like this method because it requires us to accept that a shotgun shell could be magically converted to energy cells at a workstation.  Trading one for the other makes more sense from a lore standpoint.
---
I'd check the Discord, I got mine when Survival mode was announced for 8k (so like a day of half-assed workshop player farming). I'm currently in the process of collecting an unyielding/cavaliers set so I can pop a stealthboy and sprint behind cover instead of hunkering down and trying to hit them first. I thought I was being clever with Sentinel but it's pretty much only useful saving my ass when I ambush solo players.
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
I'm glad to see there are still some good out there. I personally never attack or harass other fellow vault dwellers but my gosh lately I've been randomly attacked when I was playing with a low-level character I had just from a troll. And even get attacked with my high level character every time I have the munitions factory for more than 5 minutes. 
---
I was starting to think the whole community just turn to violence but I'm glad there's some good people out there who just want to have fun and play with some honor. 
---
Sorry man.  Try a lead deposit workshop and build one there if itll let you. Or shift to a different  type of deposit and try building that like a junk node  other than those I'm out of ideas for you.
---
How about uncommon? There's 3 catagories of mask, not 2, so how many uncommon masks should have dropped, by definition?
---
The deathclaw merchant is always found dead as far as I know. Usually find him at random event spawns with a living deathclaw and some enemies, with a deathclaw nest and some eggs.
---
The lemonade vendor is just for that: lemonade, and the plans to make the hard lemonade.
---
Graham has some random things... Sometimes weapons, a few rare plans.
---
Don't forget about the responder bot at Charleston. Got a hunters long coat today, there as well as random clean items including spacesuit and helm previously.
---
This sub isn't run by Bethesda.
---
Volunteer moderators removed your post, and they must have their own reasons.
---
Whats rare on his inventory ?
---
50 caps for 50 rounds is way too high. Most normal ammo sells for around 1 cap for 3-5 rounds on the trading subs/discords. Something that generates fewer caps than that would be necessary. So that selling to players is more beneficial for the seller and buying from players is more beneficial for the buyer. 
---
At any rate, I like the idea of bulk ammo. 
---
They won't give out keys.  Your game access isn't managed by having the game files installed, but by logging into the game after launch.  So they would just need to give you the game files.
---
It'll probably be similar to how Steam integrates with Ubisoft to handle entitlements for your accounts on both platforms.
---
Ahhh ps4. My 2011 machine boots me from the PCMR
---
My team gets this intermittently. Have to close app and restart and relog. One guy is definitely worse than the rest of us. It was never fixed as far as I can tell. 
---
&gt; 3: Judge Players that feel a need to say other players camps suck. 
---
I often roleplay as a [stuck up rich bitch](https://i.imgur.com/0GVFjy9.jpg) so I go into CAMPs and tell people their decor looks like it's from 2050. Please don't take me seriously.
---
I believe you can find a terminal at west tek that talks about specimens developed using an  advanced FEV. 
---
What you playing on?
---
What platform? 
---
So glad.
---
How can you fall off a mountainside and and land unharmed, instead of your bones being liquified by the impact? Being in a suit would make little difference, nothing could absorb that shock to your system. It’s just a game. 
---
Where do you place your items? I've been putting mine in the desk in the church in Flatwoods. 
---
Neither.
---
It literally only works under the circumstances quite clearly stated in the description: standing (which is to say not crouching) and not moving.
---
Even staggers will disable the damage mitigation.
---
Thanks bot &lt;3
---
Combat sniper if you get the drop. Shotgun if you wanna glass canon. Handmade (auto) for head on.
---
Cool! I’ll add you and check it out. :)
---
Okay. It’s your sons account and you are also taking ownership of it. This situation is awful for IT and likely your sons “ownership” of the account is moot if he is still a minor, this completely screwing up the entire process. 
---
Oh I’m on ps4
---
Get your 6 or 7 owl masks in the event like the rest of us losers! 
---
I’m glad
---
He broke the rules.......now you are at their mercy. No sympathy for cheaters......
---
So let's get to taking out their command, one by one.
---
I've been very surprised that most of the people on 76 have been nice and helpful. With a lot of online games it's the complete opposite. I was kind of shocked, but most people are friendly and helpful. This makes me want to be friendly and helpful as well.😊
---
You can put them in the toolbox at the overseer camp.
---
Great work!
---
Sorry I only see this tweet, I don't know detail for report.
---

PS4
---
I’m glad to hear it!
---
And lead, too!
---
So if your son sees that a person has accidentally dropped his wallet and he steals it rather than reurning it, he is not a thief, he is just misunderstood, right?
---
Come on.
---
Is your chat volume (same menu as type) slider set above zero. Mine keeps resetting to zero. 
---
The griefers have there own server now. Thank god.
---
Bethesda should make stash limit unlimited so all hoarders would get endless game content. That is the only content this game can offer anymore. Hoard endlessly junk.
---
I do this!!    [level 150, ps4].   I frequent the top of the World area for the armor plans and pick up every plan and recipe on the way through.  I then pass them on.  
---
Lately I’ve been helping out at site Alpha.  My camp is just up the hill and if I see someone there I’ll run down and help out.  I’ve done it solo before and it takes a chunk of time and is draining on stimpaks.  I haven’t had anyone toss me out yet...
---
A couple of level 40s were doing a Nuke run.  Probably their first.  I dropped 30 stimpaks for them when they ran out.  
---
I would love to join the Brotherhood! Ad Victoriam!!!
---
If you need anymore help I'm level 73. I'm on ps4. My PSN is Maskedpretender7.
---
They have to return the event right? RIGHT?!?!
---
I realize it’s Monday and in 30 minutes they will reset,  this is a copypasted message, if you choose to be my hired gun, i will call on you when I have the codes 
---
We have this problem on ps4 too.  Always one guy who no one can hear, our two people who can't hear each other. Spamming area with our chaos is torture.
---
Ok. I'm a level 159 and I like to trick out low level weapons and leave them. Someone gets something cool and I get AP. Win, win.
---
I know I have 2 spots on the side bar where it shows your building options, and it's got a bunch of variants each. 
---
As long as you've got the ones that have a wire node you're good to go. The main one is a wire node with 4 short conduit pieces coming of it in the shape of a cross. 
---
One of the variants of it is the wire node with one conduit piece. Put one inside, poke the conduit through the wall/roof, put another one outside (the 2 single conduit nodes will connect leaving you with a wire node inside and one outside. 
---
Wire the outside to the door, and the inside to a switch, and you can then use the switch to open the door from the inside. 
---
If you can't figure it out, I'll make a video of it tonight. 
---
I like to wear mine [like this ](https://imgur.com/a/QIWYRsy) 
---
Buy the excavator blue and red, it's only 800, it's a crude solution but I'll work 
---
No, you cant. Go try. And they deffinetly cant be killed when they are following you.
---
So human, but not super mutant since that was a failed FEV experiment?
---
Alright let me know, psn — Savio0rtega 
---
Send a message here also. I might not be on until a few hours now 
---
Good story,  I think. TLDR
---
I've been trying from the Overseer's Camp because that's also pretty close to the spawn point but I'll try yours next. Unfortunately it's pretty much all luck and the RNG gods haven't been too kind to me recently haha
---
They really do tidy up your wiring.
---
Only having a short wire running from the node to a switch along the wall is very nice.
---
Ok thank you my psn is my name -LRS0907
---
Bad example.  Nothing similar.  We are not talking about stealing here.
---
It's going to happen regardless.  They did it with Fallout 4.
---
Then don’t take it? I mean, this isn’t rocket science. If you don’t want or need it then leave it for someone who does. 
---
With no explanation or reason.  Sure, I believe it.
---
Have you found any correlation for the completion of the event and the random leather legendary that you sometimes get at the end (not from the sloth)?  If I had to guess, this was meant to be the "uncommon" mask drop...
---
Check the road on the east side of town and over the gorge by the river. 
---
lol that stuff on BrthNet was actually the Beta. This time on Steam is the real release, I promise.
---
-Pete Hines
---
I think it was a weird sub-strain. There’s a terminal somewhere in the West Tek building with info on its creation. 
---
Then don't take them
---
I have severe doubts that the bash improvement stocks increase your damage. 
---
What probably happened there is that with such a stock your laser gun is classified as a rifle and suddenly benefits from rifle perks. :)
---
I mean, they clearly asked why drop lots of masks can take, and I too would like to know. For me, the game usually only no masks drop can take do find obtain.
---
Good response I think. TLDR
---
You could paste it? It wouldn't even let me do that so I had to type out the long ass random auto generated password every time...
---
Bingo 
---
I had someone destroy my camp around me just to grief me... I wasn't upset because it only takes seconds to rebuild everything I had. I also needed to get rid of a lot of junk so all he was doing was helping me out. I guess he expected me to rage.
---
He had followed me on the map back to my camp just to destroy it... then followed me to the Whitespring resort. He gave up trying to annoy me after his plan failed... he was trying to agro all the ghouls so I couldn't kill them... what he didn't think of was that I did NOT need to kill them... all I needed to do was get 1-2 hits into them and if he killed them I still got the loot. 
---
He quickly figured out he was doing me a favor when he saw me looting the bodies and left me alone LOL 
---
With all of the trolling/griefing bullshit on other games, it’s nice to see people actually helping each other. What, exactly, is your problem with it? Is it making you realize that you generally act like an ass?
---
I have had 2 in my 2 different camps, both always worked no problemo.
---
I'll sell fasnacht donuts how much are you willing to pay
---
https://youtu.be/baPRIIk3jEE
---
How about make the effects fun and interesting instead of LOL YOU PICK UP THING THAT LOOK LIKE OTHER THING. A truly skilled player should be able to overcome downsides, randomness is shit.
---
Either a damage increase for laser guns or some AP bonus is warranted, yeah.
---
Also it was a seriously missed opportunity for a fo76 version of NVs 'set lasers for fun' perk.
---
You’ll get the Nuka Cola Clock and Cookoo Clock Plans as well. 
---
I lots of not masks can't take. Why find don't obtain :'(
---
If I may chime in, the players that hunt 2 cap bounties (or something small and similar) The amount of times I've gotten small 1 cap bounties by doing accidental player/base damage, only to be hunted down is ridiculous.
---
Sorry, I need the plan for it
---
Absolutely not, as soon as they hit over 150 i consider it game over. Nobody is that high of a level without at least one legendary explosive weapon. Levels a C.A.M.P. in 30 seconds
---
i got a saloon where the main door, toilet and guest room are unlocked but a halfway/back door/personal only doors are locked..
---
PS4 psn is LRS0907
---
There is a holotape about the "legend" of the Snallygaster,  a book also in game. 
---
I did this once... had a couple players in under level 20 I ran across playing together. I stopped, built my camp for them to use nearby them. I had all the benches and they appreciated it. I left it there for them for awhile... they got a kick out of it and it helped them alot. 
---
I found that I could paste into the launcher, not the game. So when the game flips its wig and demands a password, I force-kill it (because in that state, the game has no graceful way out!!), quit the Launcher, restart the launcher, paste the password, and restart the game. It's faster than typing my long gibberish password. 
---
does it have advanced fish AI tho
---
 [**u/MisterWoodhouse**](https://www.reddit.com/user/MisterWoodhouse) , not sure if you are the one to ask but you are listed as a mod.
---
Ugh, mic hogs. Like, just because you have a mic doesn't mean you need to tell people how to do the event they've all probably done 100 times. 
---
I have, and still didn't see a squirrel. Ill check again next time it happens, thank you tho
---
I'm a new player, and I was really surprised when I found out that they didn't! (Energy weapons are my favorite, too -- love that sci-fi flare.)
---
It’s a real joke of a game when a hammer hit does more miracles than a machinegun bullet and energy weapons are next to useless - in 100 years. 
---
Well, i already have trouble selling everything I collect (like drugs, stims) elsewhere. Playing vending can't come soon enough. I wonder what the update will ne tomorrow...
---
And up the hills too
---
PS4 here. Been having this issue since the Fasnacht event started. Sometimes when I log in the chat volume is turned all the way down, but turning it up does nothing. Usually I wouldn’t care (I don’t use a mic) but during the event I’d like to hear if people are communicating about which areas they have covered, etc. 
---
New hairstyles might be nice. That is if they don't come from the Atomic Shop
---
Makes sense. I just went with the in method above so it auto logs in. Don't even have to use the launcher anymore
---
Same here.  I just got to 150.   The biggest hurdle was getting to around 65 or so.  Then I got power armor, All Rise (level 50) and started doing White Spring Nuke events.   I could level up twice per full Nuke event.   65 to 100 was a breeze.  
---
White Springs seemed to happen at least 3 times every night.   Over the last two months I’ve seen a large decrease in White Springs Nuke events.  Either not as many people going on Nuke runs or they added a bunch of servers and its spread out more.  
---
Scarecrow stopped my animal attacks (close spawn), just mutant and scorched spawns from further away now. Mole rats definitely stay across the river. 
---
That's what triggered me :)  
---
The event is simple enough, I don't know why he felt the need to try to direct everybody's actions. He's the second one I encountered doing that event, and I was tired of it after the first time.   
---
I hope the low level at least got the loot, but I sort of doubt it.
---
I rarely have any issues on PC. Today they had some more major issues this afternoon, but those appear to be resolved now.
---
I lost my camp, my beautiful camp. It was perfect and now it's gone. All gone....
---
Let's take this into ps chat 
---
If u need someone to play with feel free to add me 
---
Psn: purpleduke_15 
---
Soooooo true. I feel like I was the one getting burned in the end.
---
Even when I had name/pw in the ini, I still had to keep the launcher happy to get updates. 
---
Seems like everyone has a different experience with this thing. 
---
I saw one person attacking another players camp, destroyed most of it.  I had resources to get rid of so I started rebuilding it. I rebuilt a bit of it while the owner of the camp and his friend was trying to kill the griefer. I didn't have a pony in that altercation so I ignored them. The person attacking the dudes camp got more kills than the camp owners.
---
Eventually the camp own server hopped... the person griefing them called me over to the nearby train station... I followed him... he then went and got a ton of Junk out of his stash to replenish what I used to rebuild the guys camp.  I thanked him and added him as a friend. Not sure what was going on... 
---
There's actually 2 random locations in the dry lake.  The one described above when you fast travel to New Gad and one that is at the southern end of the lake if you fast travel to Burdette Manor and look west it's on the last bit of land just east of the beached wooden schooner.
---
If you are close by a thing that needs to be mini nuked 5 times, THEN it’s useful but useless in any other occasion. Not worth the caps since you can just have a friend build it.
---
That's amazing I got was 6000 5.56 for free
---
When I see I low level I always ask them if they need anything I have tons of plans I’m always willing to give people weapons ammo double of anything I have !!! Sharing is caring 
---
You also have the slight issue of the ammo factory.
---
It has to be done in such a way that someone can't just squat the ammo factory and rake in the caps.
---
gotta leave it alone so folks like me can squat the ammo factory and make buckets and buckets of 5.56 god damn it
---
Oh yea, forgot to mention I was on PC.
---
Appreciated. I spent a few hours at WS waited for lowbies to come by, blowing up cars, lol.
---
Nice camp. 
---
I love living in the Ash Heap. 
---
Check the spawn point north of town. Always a bunch there.
---
Empath is really good if you're in a party of empaths. As far as I can tell it doesn't seem to be affected by class freak. It should've been a moderate damage increase when I was solo but I found it to be quite substantial.  
---
Of course it could be working but the damage boost is calculated before its reduced by your armor which would make the increased damage actually higher than the % states simply because it would reduce armors effectiveness. 
---
The two answers are compatible. The above statement from ZeniMax forbids the use of third party applications and scripts while the Bethesda Support page states that mods are "unsupported".
---
The difference being "forbidden," i.e. we'll end your service agreement; and "unsupported," i.e. if the game messes up, you're on your own. 
---
Once/if they add full mod support, I'm sure the ToS and support pages will change. :) 
---
P.s. I've been a mod author since Morrowind, and the games' stances on mods and scripts tend to evolve like this. They're not supported until the official tools and capabilities are launched.
---
I've never checked that far, didnt know they spawn all the way over there. Ive always checked inside all the buildings and around the town, thank you Ill try this next time.
---
Can confirm, this worked for me. Hop naked, used beer I found in whitesprings, shot a ghoul on the ground. I did not have to be hit and then hide as mentioned above. Thank you for the tips!
---
What platform?
---
No really, I'm proud of you for whatever you did there. 
---
Because that would make too much sense. 
---
No. The stock when selected shows the damage increasing. And when adding to the gun the damage is raised. 
---
If it does add the bash damage to the guns firing damage then what ever it’s helpful. 
---
If anything the game just adds the two sources of damage together and not separate. 
---
And that’s when I do remove rifle perks and damage increasing perks. 
---
They would be fine if we had "dragonrend" syringer ammo. The only real problem with them is that sometimes they just refuse to land.
---
And there's also another one on the road between Crevasse Dam and Braxson's Medical Supply before the last wrecked truck on the road to Braxson's.
---
Taking all the drugs at once in FO4 (well at least one drug in each category) and hearing a slow mo “OHHHHHHH YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHH” before murdering whatever poor bastard was in front of you. 
---
Check back tomorrow after the update. Maybe it'll be a little better.
---
Yeah, I've only done it a few times. You really just need people ahead and behind the parade bots and you're good. 
---
What bothers me are the clans that go ham on the mega sloth and don't allow lower level players (like me) to at least get a tag shot in. 
---
bethesda isn't going to give a fuck about steam user reviews and rightfully so because steam user reviews are garbage.
---
Nobody is calling them a victim. Bethesda is gonna be fine no matter how Fallout 76 ends up. 
---
The point is that steam just gives the bandwagon an outlet to brigade and start the outrage all over again. Nobody is going to go "maybe the game will improve! I'll try it!" they're just going to buy, write a review to call it shit, then refund and brag on reddit about how they refunded it.
---
Ooh good point. I have never taken that factory so it didn’t occur to me. 
---
Nothing. People have nuked it, and all it does is piss off anyone trying to do the event. There's already YouTube videos on it, and everything.
---
What my name ?
---
Can you do that at in my world lol. I'm low level and just having ammo at all is a privilege.
---
I want to know why there's fire work launchers with power connectors on the rooftops in helvetia that we can't use. (I haven't tried moving my camp nearby to see if I can hook them up)
---
It shouldn't affect ini changes, as that's native to the game, not something a third party created to cause unintended modifications.
---
I want the one that plays in the Pi House, I really like how catchy the music from the jukebox in that one is.  I hope we get the option.
---
Good luck on that. A-shop is their golden goose. Video games are expensive to make and maintain. This is how they make up for it. 
---
&gt;I only brought 3 fusion cores for my power armor which died 75% of the way through
---
Huh. If you don't mind my asking, do you run the Power User perk? Do you spend a lot of time in VATS? Do you use a Gatling laser? I run a [heavy weapons / power armor build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f373e86&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22ic4ip2ih2id2s72ls2lt2a04pe2cu2sg2eh2e12e60&amp;w=e00es2c52ik0e82at1lm2iq2p90p80pa0&amp;n=Hevy%20Waponz) and I keep falling ass-backwards into fusion cores faster than I can burn through them. Is there any way we can help you get more out of your fusion cores?
---
There is also a spot here  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY5zR0ZkL80&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY5zR0ZkL80&amp;t=5s) 
---
Energy weapons sans the Gatling models are more geared for support fire. 
---
Wow this looks amazing!
---
All along the river. 
---
Was wondering about that. My base is nearby and I kept seeing multiple players there. Was very confusing. Thought someone must have set up camp, but never saw a camp. 
---
So we can finally give a review of it. Shitstorm incoming ;D
---
God yeah
---
Give me a spiral staircase (like you can take up to the top of churches) or a couple of different types.
---
Maybe even a ladder that has its own animation
---
It’s a social experiment Bethesda has been doing with this game, to see what an individual would do to another for a few virtual currency. 
---
I went through all my ammo this weekend and dropped it,  I felt lighter! lol I have 2 weapons and I have ammo for those only. It would be great to sell, trade or break it down. Maybe make fireworks out of it :) like fallout 4..
---
I met a level 120 when I was playing with a friend of mine (he was a 24, I'm a 62). He asked to trade with my buddy and they proceeded to trade. Man's was giving my friend some really good deals on some weapons he had and gave my friend a bunch of materials for free then proceeded to make fusion power at his CAMP and honestly couldn't thank him enough. Gave him something like 40 stim's to try to compensate for how happy he made my friend that evening. There's some very nice people in this game no doubt.
---
Keep in mind I'm a lvl 81 who plays like a noob and if I wasn't a female I'm pretty sure no one would play with me. So good on you. 
---
I would say not very. If you want pistols, you'll probably need to go automatic and pop lots of criticals.
---
Nope. Just fun. You can pop the one vault 76
---
I wasn't aware someone had already tried it.  I would of tried it myself but I didn't want to piss off the whole server... NTM I've seen a lot of low level players in the Parade...
---
I'm at work so I can't watch the video. But I'd hope the enemies that spawn in during the event are harder. Make the event a lil more challenging.
---
You will know the song by hard right now
---
It's a simple analogy. You are trying to imply that Bethesda is to blame for the fact that your son was using exploits.
---
There ar enough pics on this sub except the PC guy who may not have gotten it legit. Curious how none have been seem on console.
---
I was running up and down the riverbed trying to find some, nada. Over by the buildings where the mutants spawn, nada there too. Up the hills behind the restaurant place, and my plague carrier mutation was going mental, just lots of tiny squeaks from all the affected animals. Went from none to 10 in about 15 seconds.
---
Eh, this would make legendaries too common. While I agree some legends are just useless, this shouldn’t change the whole system. 
---
I just wish they'd give us a point emote, so we can gesture in any direction.  Paper bag on the ground?  Point down at it.  Wanna go somewhere together?  Point.
---
A probablility of 1 out of 10 for a rare mask seems rasonable
---
It actually was pretty good about three weeks ago.  Then Patch 7 happened and PC stability became pretty questionable.
---
Yesterday and today have been better though, part of which I might owe to fewer players server hopping for the Fasnacht event.
---
I try to be a good samaritan but so many new players either dont understand (no mic) or dont trust me.
---
So instead of patrolling the Vault 76 area, i made a rest stop to the north of the overseer's camp. Every kind of workbench, a public garden with plenty of food, and the surrounding areas have logs for wood for cooking. Even a bunkhouse for sleeping and a campfire with guitars for the well tuned bonus.
---
I havent had many visitors, but the ones i have had greatly enjoyed it and through me a heart emote after using every station (aside from one asshole who leveled the place when i refused to fight back when he stabbed me)
---
When player vending becomes a thing, i plan to sell as much as i can for affordable prices for a new player. I cant help everyone, but i can help those who pass by.
---
If you're not able to find a seller you can make 5.56 at the converted munitions factory. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Converted_munitions_factory
---
&gt; the reason it was so limited was to stop people from just using it as storage rather than a trading mechanism
---
You could move 1 set of guns at a time - what if you wanted to move more than that set? What about shields and class mods? What if your current character was out of vault space so you needed to shift a bunch of stuff over to a different character?
---
Wouldn't a "perfected" system let you move as many items as you want with no chance of players abusing it for more storage space? BL2's was good, sure, but not perfect. 
---
Honestly, I'd just do some research and find what perks you want. Right now I'm working on a mediocre rifleman sole-survivor build (do everything he needs on his own). 
---
So I'd just say find out what perks you want, and add them in. 
---
We definitely need single tile, multi-level staircase that can be used to create multi-story structures in a more economical way.  At the moment you can stack the 2-tile staircase on top each other with some clever exploiting, but it has some awkwardness to it. 
---
Try changing what you are filtering by
---
You should really read what I wrote instead of assuming something.  
---
That being said, since r/fo76 decided to hide this post, I'm not interested in discussing anything else.
---
No, I don’t run that perk. I use a VATS crit rifle build although I’m starting to slowly switch over to a heavy weapons build by getting rid of some fluff perks first. I have more cores I just didn’t bring more than 3 because of the weight and since it was a blind run I didn’t know if the silos had any good loot in them.
---
I do sprint a lot in PA the rare times I use it so I’m guessing I should take that perk for it. 
---
Thanks, that’s my go to....spent everything on the Queen so looking to reload easier 
---
Thank you. I almost quit after using my matches cards on an already open bunker. 
---
Second try, both me and my wife were able to get the plans. Separate servers but playing it at the same time in two tv’s. So I guess not as many people are doing this now.
---
Such a fun hidden quest. The hard one for me was finding the keys for tnt 2. But have that figured out now as well. Someone had already unlocked the one with t51( or whatever #), armor paint. They even left the plans after unlocking it. Super nice of them.
---
Mines are great!  Why useless?
---
Yes.
---
In particular, I'd really like dreadlocks.
---
