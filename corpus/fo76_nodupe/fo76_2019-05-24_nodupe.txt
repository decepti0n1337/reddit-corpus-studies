Breh, they don't play their own game.
---
---
---
Well...it's not that i wouldn't understand that. Fingers crossed!
---
I had a daily mission to take a picture of two players fighting each other while you were all naked. Wish I was making this up. So not only does Bethesda make broken games they’re also pervs
---
yes,  the item showed up with a player given name , however named after my power armor 0\_o
---
Just say fus roh dah.
---

---
Dense mod on chest piece also negates its attacks by alot.
---
haven't found any
---
Yea it’s hard to make friends online as an adult. I just don’t know how. I don’t have any friends. I can go for days and not speak to anyone. I really needed 76 to be good.
---
Come back tomorrow.
---
Any idea where to find that mod for marine armor?
---
That’s happening for me too.   Crafting tables are gone, safes, Whole walls sometimes.  But my friend said they were there for her.    I fast traveled and that seemed to fix it.  But it’s happening a lot since this last patch.
---
The only time it was ever this bad for me was when duping was a thing. That being said I just crashed a survival server by nuking Morgantown
---
The Mr. Handy you first meet inside the vault will use your characters name if you happened to pick one that got voiced. My science guy Grant was greeted by name when I made him.
---
I hope they will add some sort of alien themed update/dlc! I rememver the ufo flying over me in fo4 and freaking out! Good times
---
I save up and then spend equally on 3 and 2 stars.  
---
Saving for 3 stars mostly makes sense to me personally if I'm already good to go with solid 2 stars.  As that's not the case for me personally I prefer to try to get a bit more bang for my buck with 2 star items.  
---
If/when I have all the 2 star gear I want dialed in, I'll start exclusively buying 3 stars.
---
Well obviously it’s a coding issue not translation error.  If diseased ghoul are shown as blue angels, that’s poor translation.
---
A two shot explosive flaregun would make my day.
---
Landview lighthouse had it on first try for me
---
Wow! That rivals some FO4 modded settlements!
---
I’m destroying my beautiful brick mansion tonight. Your build pleases my immersion.
---
Wow. Just like Codsworth
---
Wonder if that means he can still greet you by "Mr Assface"
---
Can prob buy mod from vendorbots, mabey try watoga. Not completly sure on which vendor though.
---
The connectors were titanium steel and one of the first things stripped by raiders for their power armor jobs.  That’s my head canon for working this out :)
---
yep, agreed.  the tertiary effects are often useful but not game breaking.  Good 2 star items are the foundation of a solid build.
---
I've seen two of those bastards, and both times were within the last month.  These challenges are so niche they're beyond ridiculous.
---
Pretty much everything you said was a lie though? People are just too stupid to realize it.
---
whats tagging?
---
I like how everyone downvoted you just to make their complaint seem more valid. Petty at its finest.
---
So now every time I fast travel I crouch immediately so there’s a chance that the invisible enemies won’t detect me right away.
---
Yeah but Titanium is literally everywhere.
---
[removed]
---
i can game for 8 plus hours on ps4 no crashes :) and people say PC is so much better than Console, yet they are crashing every 2 mins :)
---
My whole team is adults. We have old guys, young people, ladies, it's great! I think it's worth stating most of the ladies are mothers of 3, so definitely bot youngins
---
That’s really strange. I sold a lot of ammo today and paid close attention to my cap count and round count and the caps I’m getting from sales is accurate with the 10% tax. I will say that every time I log off and log into a new world my camp budget duplicates again so maybe there’s multiple bugs with this patch.
---
I'll add you. I'm rich-monsoon on PS4.
---
Store them. Don't list stuff that will put you above cap limit? Don't list when close?
---
Yah it wouldn't be a issue of it tagged all players who do a set of of dam to all enemies in the event to qualify OTHERWISE people would spam your events and lag you out potentially looking all loot for everyone.
---
#falseadvertisement
---
Tried solo project paradise and fa iled badly. But still killed the sheep squatch will help of a turret. Repaired it a few times alot of ammo but was worth it. Lol never again cause the assaultrons are murder...
---
All depends on the mods. Sorry, but a mod that allows you to use keyboars to write numbers is not cheating, its adjusting console UI to PC reality, and if you played F76 both on pad and keyboard/mouse you'll agree this UI is 100% console oriented.
---
While stuff like glowing bags and plans is outright cheating imo, because it makes a competetive aspect of gameplay neglectable for some people without sacrificing the results, the keyboard-number stuff or Better Inventory mod have NOTHING to do with cheating.
---
I rolled with one of those for over fifty levels....I still break it out now and then.
---
I don't think you can steam it at all.  Unless you bought a physical copy, I guess.
---
The way to get around this in the past was to close the respawn map that comes up and then open your map normally.  It would display all of your known points and you could appropriately choose where to respawn.
---
I'm on now. You? 8:11 EST
---
This is why I just stay quiet and take what's given to me. I don't know how any of this works and I have other things in my life to do than to learn about some random game shortcoming. If enough other people have the time and energy to speak in a more educated manner, then I can learn from them, maybe chime in with a personal anecdote to back things up, and leave it be. I refuse to be chastised for being human in gaming communities anymore.
---
So empty out 4 full vending machines every time business picks up? I guess some people prefer to work harder than smarter. Not a difficult mechanism to add to the game. It’s already in place when selling to vendors. Literally there is only three variables to change to the coding that already exists in the game to make it work.
---
I found a camp with 4 locked industrial purifiers, so I just nabbed all his crops and left.
---
It’s simple, just make the RLS option only available after a crash/freeze. It can be easily abused.
---
So I figured this out based on previous questions. Bethesda removed the ability to get the dense mod by scrapping combat armor. I’ve scrapped over 200 pieces and got everything but. I picked up the dense mod from the grafton responders vender for 55 caps. It’s just called combat dense torso mod. Just keep server hopping till you find it.
---
If this would be the case, it'll either ruin lore of 76 or the point of the game prior to the expansion.
---
This also applies to sons of dane if you let the event go as long as possible it will continually spawn enemies alot of them with the boss crown and they drop tonds of chems sometimes you will get legendary enemies.
---
 I'm pretty sure Wallace has that. In Harper's Ferry.
---
I'll be on at 9pm EST, until about 11. Please contact GT Antlawa. What mats will you need?
---
Yeah the moment I see them pop up at my camp I just log off now. They're not worth killing for the loot at my level and I'm fine with jumping to another instance so I don't have to content with them.
---
respawning during the event i always reswpawned into the event again never had to fast travel at all
---
 I'll keep going back. ;)
---
I imagine a world where opening a safe isn't a dice roll to crash to desktop... Man I'd be so happy.
---
This is also me. My husband actually played my character until I got to about level 75, then we got a second PlayStation and now we play together. He kills the things and I loot the things. It works well. Are you on PS4? You’re welcome to join us if you ever want to. Whereismowgli and iambagel1.
---
Oh I know, I started at the beta. There was a ton of things that needed fixed from the start, but BGS even said something along the lines of "this is our first online game and there's going to be a ton of changes and fixes in the first few months based on player feedback" from the beginning and people were still here acting like it was completely out of line that an online Fallout game had bugs at launch, and spun it as "literally unplayable" because of any number of things that didn't permanently restrict your ability to play the game. 
---
I think that people just hyped the game up way to much from the beginning, shat on the game when it didn't meet those expectations, then the whole outrage culture that's all too prevalent in game took over and you had people that had literally never played the game also shitting on it.
---
Are you talking about Fallout 4 or Fallout 76? 
---
Because in my knowledge there are no mods yet that have made it into Fo76
---
Yeah once the modding community fixed them lol. Same with Elder Scrolls.
---
That’s genius. I’ll try this with my friends later.
---
Those are possum badges, not tadpole.
---
This shouldn’t be a suggestion, it NEEDS to happen. Nonetheless, we barely have enough time to load the troughs up so I think we need extra time for that.
---
I bring a quad tesla to events when there’s many people. Level 40 supervisors are very squishy, so are the glowing ones in WS. Tesla or db shotty let me tag a whole bunch without killing any.
---
Last count 132 on my main + maybe another 150 between my other 3 toons still no ultracite powercore plan.
---
Thank you. Its incredibly frustrating trying get a tag on the main boss sometimes. Whenever I'm at the event with the imposter, it's very hard for me to get a shot on him because of all the robots. So I, along with many others, will focus on taking out the mobs, becoming conduit, and reviving everyone while the more powerful players focus on the boss. It really sucks to do all that work, only to not be rewarded because you weren't able to slap the boss before it killed you.
---
As an fyi, you can discover locations on an alt character to trigger the credit for it.
---
I can mod it free, but it will be an hour before I get on.
---
Will there be an announcement when this gets implemented?
---
There is no point and no value gained from switching to heavy variant of same armor.
---
Level 20 godroll leather armor is vastly superior from level 50 BoS Heavy Combat with imperfect rolls. People overestimate the influence of DR in this game. The rule of thumb is the more effects synergy the better the end result, where DR is only a small fraction of the math that's happening and just a single defensive effect. Get a wooden armor, dense, fireproof dodgy + crafted light leather armor and put that against heavy bos vanguard 1* armor, none of those perks, and test same explosive weapon against the two combinations. The lowDR good combos will stand much more shots.
---
see I am at 900 hours plus so some times I get all smarty pantsy and know it allish then someone like you makes a brilliant but simple suggestion that gives me new humility . thats an awesome idea I should have thought about ages ago but I have been impatiently scrolling down past everything the whole damn time.
---
Im the clueless chicken. But I res downd players all the time and just wildly shoot my smg in the direction of baddies. Im having fun and someone almost always gives me a goodie bag. Some ppl are grateful to be healed and not have someone waiting for your junk bag.
---
I think there's a consensus outdoor gardens our community gardens.
---
IMO, the Legendary should be part of the quest reward, as well as rare items like fluxes, plans and not looted from Boss. The Boss mob should only have common items. Mainly because now that the Purveyor is in the game people can, particularly melee, take the legendary and turn it in. It's worth something to them. Greed has always been part of these loot based multiplayer games for 20 years but there are ways to keep it under control.
---
It's not complicated to scale the quest reward level to the contribution amount. Late joiners, for instance, don't get credit for completed phases that they didn't contribute to.
---
&gt;maybe same needs to be done with weapons..
---
I'd bet my life that you spend yours protesting violence.
---
We already sort of do. You can directly trade caps for a random legendary roll(s) by buying assaultron cards to do the encryptid event. Plans are a nice but temporary cap sink - if you trade or sell to players enough, you might already have every available plan. Fast travel eats your caps away, but too slowly. We need more small  conveniences that cost a certain amount of caps - having an in-game vendor with repair kits instead of atom shop ones would have been perfect. Player vending tax works great, and even though people are using these machines extensively, it's not quite enough.
---
I like it when the camps are centralized.  It’s like mall.  
---
We should be able operate a pretzel stand or a cell phone kiosk where you can buy crap accessories for your phone.
---
I've actually got some pretty good stuff from people there.
---
Yes please, don’t need all these fucking keys in the way when I’m trying to find ore and gunpowder
---
&gt;Pinpoint locations condemns you to death.
---
Well....only from the...very few who stand a chance....right? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cringe.
---
I get that the legendary rolls themselves make the item but I’m looking to just change it from normal set of 3* unyielding to 3* heavy unyielding
---
Problem was I owned two workshops and didn’t want to leave them. 
---
But it didn’t matter cause the server disconnected after I killed it 🙃
---
Congrats!  I have a explosive lever too. Good times.  Great sniper!
---
It's a waste of resources to be locked! The extractors and purifiers fill up quickly and being away from the camp for long enough, they stop producing and is a waste if people aren't taking it!
---
Foot traffic. That's one of the neccessary things for any business. People that have set up shops near to common stops are just increasing their odds to make a sale, maybe not the original poster, but maybe enough to get a comfy bit of profit.
---
I got a bloodied 50% more critical dmg and -25% vats cost lever action for 75 caps 😂 traded it for a be lever action and a tse laser rifle
---
I'm on PC. It went down yesterday, in about 3 hours of play. I was surprised, its very rare for me.
---
thx
---
True. It is nice not having to spend caps travelling around. Its just theres always that one guy who builds his vendor almost at the front door on the tracks and i cant help but feel like they're forcing it on people lmao
---
I kinda agree with you... I mean they could at least have a little creativity and find a plot of land on the golf course like the 5-10 other peps on every single server
---
The Mirelurk Hunter not the Queen.
---
Just killed the alpha sheepsquatch in Paradise, no plan nor costume, not even a usual rolling pin, just meat and bones.
---
Nope
---
Back in the dark days all I got was bullets to the face and death
---
It doesn't matter how good you are when someone is stalking you via GPS. The few players that can destroy me don't stand a chance if im stalking them either.
---
I didn’t specify, but it was a hunter. Why did it decide to attack? I tried to block it from going up there.
---
carot is a rolled cigarette
---
caret is /\^
---
Using caps really gives too much control to the dupers and people already close to God level in the fsne and would further hurt people that struggle for caps and just enjoy the game. I know I'll ge down voted but the average player would be so far disadvantaged by using caps
---
No. There are already 3 in game. Moving camps fast travel, vending tax. That's enough.
---
I found it faster to just make another character!
---
Cool. Where’s the generator?
---
My first time doing that event we succeeded. 
---
Every other time the event has failed, and it's always because nobody protects the friendlies. It's a super frustrating event if people don't work together as a team. I'm not sure how in hell the first time was successful, as we only had one creature left and it only had a sliver of health from almost the start.
---
The light/medium/heavy aspects of armor are considered mods and are applied as invisible mods which add weight meaning thay the medium and heavy versions of armor types don't benefit from the 90% weight reduction. They basically get the same numerical deduction a light piece gets.
---
&gt; when I get to looting she just spins
---
smack the crap out of her in melee when this happens. usually makes her lootable. I've seen it happen more than a couple times and it has worked every time.
---
Free range Sheepsquash are 1* anyway!
---
I agree
---
Do you honestly think that saying cringe like that is less cringey than someone clarifying their opinion? 
---
C'mon man. It's not.
---
Think so?
---
The alien is the playoffs minter you can fight it late game
---
Im also big on spots so i would never want to fight over spots with other store owners out that way. Id there rather set a nice store up near overseers like some do.
---
Maybe it's time to remove the other useless melee items like the pool cue, knuckles and walking cane.
---
Yep, that's the sweet spot. I think I'd play survival if it worked like this.
---
When was this? And where exactly?  take pic next time bro ! Plz! Haha
---
I never move my camp.  I can't stock my camp vendors because I'm at cap max.  And why do I need to fast travel when I can pick a spot and switch servers over and over again.  Even when I do bounce around the map in 4 hours of game play, I'm LUCKY if I use 500 caps of my daily 1400.
---
That’s a good bit. Bet you’re chuck full of them.
---
Problem is i join a server and see an event and im expected to wait 5 minutes before joining said event to actually play?
---
I think they are hinting at us that ALIENS ARE COMING !!!!!? haha ( its a question) .
---
Sell them for nearly free at 20 caps, unless it's a rare plan!
---
Spear and jackson shovel?
---
Still waiting to hear what your point is
---
is tagging just shooting?
---
I only ever get 1* from that event.... Sometimes only one legendary spawns....
---
This lore is 90% game
---
About 700hours, spread across 5 toons( I know I have a problem) I have seen it 5 times, killed 3.  4 times at 2 did camps.(the lead by the supermutant home town, and the lead between berkley and the meat shack.
---
I don’t even know why they made survival it sucks dingaling
---
That's tru I try to do both but your right
---
I agree, and I would like to see the distinction acknowledged between them and legitimate predators.
---
Yep
---
Shit, it even has additive lore - not retcons - for Fallout 1 and 2!
---
When lusting after a female robot isn't enough...
---
It should not, because perks only work on what you have on yourself.
---
1. They are considering the entire playerbase not just you.
---
2. Many people move their camp fairly often
---
3. Most people play the game and so they do fast travel alot rather than just sit in one spot and server hop (not sure how you are having fun that way)
---
4. The average player also doesn't grind the daily 1400 every day.
---
If you're on the side of the pacifists you're not representing yourself well
---
That's not a goodie bag its people dropping their garbage loot lol. All you gotta do is what the quest tells you. It's all laid out for you and even has markers.
---
I played on XB1 today for 8-9 hrs ran completely fine. Only 1 stutter for a few secs after completing the Encryptid event.
---
2. This game is not free to play. I paid $60 to play it.
---
Check r/falloutcaptures for photo lovers. 
---
Im on that as Well.
---
Ah did not know that
---
Ive seen three in almost 600 hrs, the first disappeared when I shot at it. He was across a ravine in the hills south, the second I killed in the forest, the third was near a shack with poison pond or something, it was being chased by a yao guai into the pond and killed it? Then the bear died. Have a pic of them both dead.
---
That wouldn't make any sense at all, since it only a spawns a cryptid and not a specific one (so no way to control if you got the one needed for the daily that day).
---
Yep, all of the above. It's pretty common too.
---
No perk that grants double meat
---
Has a ‘chance’ to grant ‘extra meat’
---
Anyway, save the perk card slots. 
---
Use Herbivore and plant corn
---
Eat corn soup. Satisfies hunger and thirst at the same time. Most efficient
---
Eh, those are at least viable. I know some people use them just for fun. The pool cue is surprisingly powerful for how light it is, it's a nice option for people who are willing to give up a bit of damage for not carrying around a 20 pound sledge.
---
You are completely missing the joke here.
---
If you have so many caps why not buy legendaries from other players and then convert to scrip? The average player struggles to earn enough caps to buy anything cool they want so you buy stuff from lower levels you're also helping them out to. And no I'm Not saying give away free stuff etc but the average player doesn't even have one mule or any really impressive weapons because they don't farm legendaries they simply roam around with friends. I understand they need more content for you higher level guys but allowing a simple cap to legendary trade at the vendor further bridges the gap between the average and the dedicated player. Look at recent posts about lower levels are even having trouble getting a single legendary because higher levels one shot everything.
---
I kill the trash mobs in the SBQ just so I can try and save the poor frames.

---
I always go for herbivore .. silva homestead .. grab corn run to the shore to the west with the cookin station load up on water boil it cook it, like 2-3 mins tops .. corn soup fill both food and water .. only perk I ever use is rejuvinated .. I only carry maybe 10-20 corn soup on me lasts awhile then just repeat .. no need for reduced carry weight or reduce rads or ... etc etc etc

Use / Select / Activate.  General  "do stuff" button.

When did you sell it?

funny how other "data collectors" mention ammos being the worst sold... and even excluding Shotgun Shells

You're not running West Tek Mart. You're running a mom and pop Red Rocket franchise.
---
Grafton monster is a alien
---
Like I said. Start off easy!
---
It was clear in my first comment. I'm making light of your misfortune
---
Same here. I feel like maybe the people experiencing the massive disconnects have corrupted files or something.
---
60% of the time it works every time, you say? Thanks I’ll give ‘er a good beat down next time 👍🏻
---
The Omertas had a good cap sink idea. A couple good ideas actually. Too bad they're a few hundred years in the future.
---
Can confirm it’s not.  I’ve taken photos and killed the Grafton monster many times. Both challenges are not complete
---
stable flux would be another option but sure, I don't see a problem with the general idea.
---
That sounds like what is left after you kill him and not when he flies away (never had anything left behind when he leaves only from kills).
---
I'm looking for one to try out. I'll see if I can get a pic with one.
---
Maybe that’s the way you run yours. But I am buying 10k of inventory of day and maxing out just as fast.
---
I was just wondering if aliens are gonna show up soon. The world challenge for take different pictures of creatures, I snapped a pic of a flatwoods monster i killed. The challenge checked of take a pic of the flatwoods monster but it left the take pic of an alien open. It did not work the same as killing a flatwoods monster counting for both.
---
lol Though, joking aside, what I give is a direct result of what I personally do not need. Sometimes I have enough aluminum that I dump what I have, sometimes I am in short supply. Same goes for Adhesive, Oil, Nuclear Waste, etc :P
---
The yea, the Imposter is the stuff of nightmares. If you have Power Armor, then the real Sheepsquatch is like a nice massage. There's some pain when having knots worked out, but it all works out in the end; especially if you fight it solo, as it's much weaker. Imposter though, since there are generally so many folk that attend, the difficulty scales, and so you'll see people run-for-their-literal-lives when they get targeted :P Me, I activate one of the pylons and jump and jetpack on to the roof of the cabin so she can't ram her hydraulics-powered-fist up my ass... that's just not my thing, sorry. lol It's not just her though, it's all the fucking Mr Gutsy adds that she spawns. I don't care about the laser-firing ones, but those bullet firing bastards HURT!! So I make sure to bring roughly 30 Plasma Grenades with, and when they're in a nice cluster (usually right as they spawn or if they've amassed to harass someone in particular), and toss 3 or 4 kind of spread out, since they usually 'run' to avoid the explosion.
---
And yes, the PVP does seem kinda fair, regarding levels. Particularly if you get some good sneaky shots off. I've not engaged in PVP (intentionally), but have been on the receiving end a few times. :|
---
I do buy legendaries when I can find them.  If you got them on xbox, hit me up.  20 caps per scrip.
---
I forgot about this because I usually mashed a button to skip everything.
---
I do enjoy 76 takes us right to the game.

My PC's not the best, gt1030 8gb ram and and i5 3470 I play for about 3-5 hours straight every other night once in a while after an update it's a bit laggy but only the occasional disconnect.
---
😂
---
Awww, thank you. Very much. I love designing bases. My only gripe is that I can't either have more than one, or that the blueprints barely work if you want to build anything neat.
---
Alright, I’ll do it but next time it should be more challenging. Because, anyway I think it could be great to have community challenges and upvotes as rewards. I’ll upload in a few minutes.
---
Useable ones?! ;0
---
Haha this has happened to me recently at whitesprings 
---
My camps have always been slow to load and i put that down to my crappy internet speed 
---
I logged into whitesprings 2 nights ago and i thought that someone else must have killed everything in the clubhouse area so i wemt wandering around then something started hitting me i couldnt see anything so put it down to disease so took a cure and again more so i just started whacking at the air with a sword luke a loon then i was dead 
---
Loaded back in and all of a sudden dead and flat gouls started appearing like fish on the ground 
---
I again put it down to my crap internet and the beer 
---
Good to hear this isnt my internet and better again the ammount of beer 😀😀
---
Sounds like a problem specific to a niche. How about cutting back?
---
"Come back when you are ready to go all the way." - KL-E-0
---
No
---
At the time most of us we're silly strong though. I remember i could one shot the sloth with an emote 😂😂😂. So I think people killing quickly wasn't intentional
---
Allow conversion of  caps to scrip at a 50:1 ratio.    25000 caps would get you 5 3* weapon rolls.
---
Herbivore means no disease chance from plant based food, so no need to iron stomach.  Also, no need for double meat perk, or cannibal perk.  
---
I am currently carrying 158 RadAway and 89 Diluted RadAway.  With Travelling Pharmacy at lvl 3, the combined RadAway and Diluted weigh 7.41 pounds in backpack.  Radiation is not an issue.  No need for Lead Belly.
---
I went Herbivore and have Green Thumb loaded. I have 8 corn stalks at my base, which provides 16 corn.  I gather 32 Dirty Water and convert the dirty water to boiled using 16 wood.  I then craft 16 Corn Soup (Weighs 0.5 per) using 16 more wood.  With Super Duper rank 3, I usually have 20 to 24 Corn Soup which lasts a couple hours.  Herbivore means that you also get twice the bonus for Food and Water per plant based meal.
---
Meat is HEAVY.
---
What stereotypes? I call everyone man, apologised ma'am :) hope you find some friends to play with soon!
---
I totally agree with you, though you sounded a bit rude.
---
They mean letting everyone get a shot in on the enemy that way they are part of the kill and get to loot the corpse aswell
---
It tagged as complete though we I did it ??? Had a friend tell me that was how to do it
---
It is a random at a fixed location.
---
Flat woods Monster is a Random encounter
---
It's a static spawn in the world
---
It's found in the toxic valley. Kinda hidden but always at the same spot.
---
Son of a bitch. Flatwoods. The purple thing. Not grafton. That’s my fault
---
Static spawn, part of an unmarked questline
---
There's 2 there, did you get them both?
---
That's good news!
---
Carnivore. It's what I have. Just kill stuff and eat it. Or cook it up if you want the buffs. I never run out of food to eat. I don't use lead belly anymore. I have one point in Sun Kissed. As for diseases, I don't worry too much about them. I mostly catch them from fighting enemies or breathing toxic air. I just carry around disease cure and antibiotics. I still use green thumb to make certain plant recipes for the buffs (for example, cranberry relish).
---
Everyone should be able to loot the corpse as far as i know
---
I'm sorry but I disagree with you completely on this and what you wrote on the person's comment.
---
Hunter hunted isn't successful because not everyone likes PvP when they feel it can be unbalanced vs players with specific items. Theres a very low chance of reward, the reward isn't good and there's already survival servers.
---
Everytime I join a Sheepsquatch/queen, there are PLENTY of people there, because of the notification. But I've had times where I went to the Arktos event, wait around for 2-3min and nobody shows even though that event has a 3* legendary at the end, uses less resources (bullets/stimpack/radaway-queen. Stimpacks-sheepsquatch) and new content rewards. Because no notification.
---
The notification isn't intrusive, it's a tiny little banner that shows up in the corner of the screen for like 5-10 seconds. It's not sirens blaring like every nuke going off. But hey, if that's apparently SO intrusive, then they could just add a world events notification filter in the settings
---
I have! Some of my older builds atleast, I haven't posted this in it yet
---
As others said, it only spawns in one place. There is a sort of hidden quest around it, but it's so cryptic that pretty much no normal player will ever figure it out. That quest also leads you towards the plans for the ammo and converted fusion mag mod (so you can make it shoot fusion cells instead of alien blaster ammo)
---
Be wary though that you will be highly disappointed with it, the damage is outright awful and it's pretty buggy
---
I've only seen Flatwoods once, ONCE! and I spent a whole day looking for him once
---
Herpetologist is fixed, Chemist can now be completed because the new event lets you unlock the Stimpak Diffuser. There's a chance Musician has been fixed too. I can't remember the others, sorry.
---
upvoted cause this would help me save the planet faster ... 
---
&lt;&lt; H.O.W.E.V.E.R &gt;&gt;
---
if mounts are to be added we need these mounts FIRST AND FOREMOST SIR!!
---
1. Molerat
---
2. Rad Toad
---
3. Snally Gnasters
---
Everything else would be just silly .. move along
---
Did you make sure you updated everything including the FalloutCustom.ini after the updates?
---
Sorry I’m not sorry.
---
That's so nice thank you! Lol
---
I got a Vanguard's sentinel scout armor for 500 caps there lol
---
I mean, it serves Hornwright right for their industrial sabotage against Garrahan, firing all their workers in favor of robots and hiring contractors to disperse them when they protested, shooting a journalist investigating the Motherload, and turning an air purifier into a machine that sucks metal from the air and solidifies it, and then lightning their old mines on fire (ie, Belching Betty) to make a profit from it!
---
I thought I reads on here that the Flatwoods monster doesn't count as an alien. Could be wrong though.
---
No problem thanks for responding. Musician didnt work for me today.
---
You can give those to me, I have never had more than 2k caps because fast travel and repairing CAMP, armor and guns takes all my caps. Not to mention player vendors that takes ton of caps to get new plans and such stuff. We should instead balance the economy because there are 50% of us who have nothing and 50% of players like you who have like 125k caps. Game should base fast travel cost according player cap amount, like if I have 300 caps it shouldn't cost 50 to fast travel across map , rather 20 caps. And for player that has 20k caps it would cost 500 caps.
---
Thank you so much!
---
BRUUUH  if you were still willing to give out codes I'm interested
---
A Deathclaw mount would be pretty cool though.
---
I’m a herbivore through bad RNG, I’m often too busy killing things to boil water and cook a healthy meal so have found that in desperation you can still eat spoiled meat and gain food through the cannibal perk card.
---
Wait you mean they should add a toggle that players can turn on or off? Like I suggested? Maybe you don't disagree as much as you seem to think.
---
Carnivore for constant easy food. You can easily have too much meat that it will all go bad because you won't have to eat it lol
---
This comment killed me, all the legends and spookiness behind him only to see him get wrecked by a mutated bear
---
exploding anti armor doesn't matter the perks what's that is done
---
Handy Blades with the Electric mod are still great against softer targets. Great for ghoul grinding, especially if you get a Furious or Vampiric legendary. Vampiric, I can kill a SB without even the slightest concern, although it does take a while.
---
Ooh! I like that theory. Personally I thought it was a cover for a shady government agency, but this is also quite fitting. And thanks for the mention!
---
No, when a nuke is dropped it makes sounds. Cryptid has a silent, small yellow box, in the top left corner, for like 2-5 seconds. That's a world event notification. If it's not that memorable, then it's not that intrusive.
---
I don't think hostility will get you far in a suggestion.
---
These are great points.  This is how I set up my camp and I can say that people buy all the time.   I keep prices low to move stuff.  Only 3 or high quality 2 star stuff in my vendor at low prices.  I will put a stash close by.  That’s a good idea.  Hopefully others will follow.  Sooner or later, players will realize the 1 star Troubleshooters golf club isn’t going to sell for 850 caps.
---
I have found that the rad kelp spawns but doesn't glow immediately, taking a small amount of time to start glowing and producing smoke. and especially certain spots that are lit up by the new plants don't show up easily, and if you run around spamming the pick up button, espescially along the edges of the zone you can grab lots of rad kelp that doesn't show up but is collectable
---
This might be xbox weirdness, or some other bug on my end, but I have solo almost gotten to stage three running around grabbing the invisible kelp. I think the most I got was 57 solo, which is just short of the queen. I had to not turn off the robots to achieve this as that takes time, the most I've gotten turning off the robots was 43.
---
I wonder if the anglers and such are supposed to be dropping kelp like the enemies in the other zones.
---
I'm building a new character that's non-PA, rifle, stealth sniper, one handed mele character.   My lvl 192 character is happily a heavy gunner and my go to for SBQ and nuke events.  I'd like a respec option in case my new build isn't working.  I'd like a solution for dupe cards though... I've got too many redundant cards (some given by game, some stupidly picked by me).
---
Good lord, KL-E-0 was a hand full
---
"I'm a woman, baby. Can't you tell?"
---
"Anything that can kill a man, I sell. Except suicidal depression. That is unfortunately not packageable."
---
"I've got a weapon for every situation. Hunting, protection, cold blooded murder, ***HOT*** blooded murder."
---
"Each weapon tested on someone who deserved it"
---
"New Designation: K-L-E-0 'Kleo'. Fully independent small business owner. But as far as I'm concerned, I'm a woman. And I run a store that sells *very* large guns."
---
The problem people have is that these are not challenging: they are just tedious and unnecessarily stupid grinds. A proper challenge would be a 10 or 20 point daily to launch a nuke or kill a scorchbeast. Taking a picture of your friend mooning a legendary radroach at 3:15PM is not a challenge, it's just a waste of time. It's annoying and potentially stressful to the people who want to play alone due to social anxiety or just preferring that game style. Fallout has been a single player franchise up until now, it's not surprising that a large amount of players want to continue playing (relatively) alone. 
---
I agree that the repair kit thing is stupid. I didn't ask for them, but their presence doesn't affect me at all. The only repair kits I have is a hoard of improved ones from events, and I have yet to ever use one
---
Man thats actually a great idea. I give away the .38 ammo so imgm guessing you would never need to craft it. An almost free ranged weapon.
---
Sadly doesn't always work, as I have alts and the locations still won't unlock for them either.  I did manage to get a few of the other ones completed that hadn't been working though, so it seems to be hit or miss on resolving the issue.
---
It is still an unwelcome intrusion on an already busy screen. I don't know how it is so difficult for people to understand that some people do not want this on their screen. We are not going to come help you anyway.
---
Thats what I've told everyone I've helped. They say they'll repay me somehow, i say no no no. When you grow up and get well equipped like us, go out and find a you. Help them build a fusion generator, help with their cards, give them some materials. Just pay it forward to the next one.
---
You’re being paranoiac, I need a real proof for that Stalker Scorchbeast.. I can’t believe that it would fly from one corner of the map to the other just to fight you. I think it was a rare coincidence rather. And you must be tired, you should take a break from this game. :)
---
There’s plans for The Fixer? That’s my favorite non-legendary
---
I caught you but sorry, no voice chat for me and got disconnected and missed you - no worries tho!
---
Yeah, same ash pile but no xp (cuz he flew away) and less loot. And he doesnt do the weird seizure death animation.
---
Ah okay makes sense. 
---
I’m a die hard walk-to-everything kinda player after being used to it in survival, fo4. 
---
And I have not yet stumbled across anything regarding it. 
---
Maybe I will have to look it up sometime. I like to collect these things. 
---
Thanks 2 u 2!
---
the re-spawn rates need to be static and or triggered by quest events. current system plus early exploits had players at 100 plus in the first day. still see the occasional level 400 roaming around. I can see it being possible to be 400 by now if played legit but that's only with a lot of grinding and no alt characters. just my opinion and i cant really say I am concerned anyway.
---
Backpack backpack!! / new event in Arktos Pharma (warning may cause the game to crash)
---
Easiest way to make money and exp every day.  Go to Billings and Silvia, pick all the corn and razorgrain.  Make soup.  Sell soup. Set up a bunch of water extractors.  Sell purified water.  If you're highe enough.  Jump servers at Gulper Lagoon.  Gulper slurry sells for a bunch.
---
It’s a rare drop from the Encriptid event. And the level 50 fixer I made is one of my four regular rifles. Very nice.
---
Looks like I got some farming to do
---
Quercus heals the friendlies between waves if you disable the computer. I've yet to see the friendly creatures stay away from the boss. Shutdown code or not. With no tanky character in the alphas face your friendly dies. End of story. I've got the only tanky character in my team. Without him, we failed 4/5 attempts.
---
Not a niche if everybody is limited to 25k
---
Ahh yes please I’m also on PS4. PSN : king_g4merr3
---
I’m trying to level up my level 10 character (heavy gunner build) to at least level 50 :D
---
Looks great! Mind sharing the location?
---
Would be intrersting.  My Instigating Chinese officer sword with faster swing and my Vampire's revoulationary sword with faster swing.  Good combo if dual wielded.  I'd try my bloodied revolutionary sword with the Chinese sword and see which does better.
---
Good luck and happy hunting. :)
---
I’ve been disconnecting once every couple of hours since launch on the PS4. It’s rather annoying
---
What happens in the current respec? Im not there yet but.   Do you only get 1? Do you have to use it right then and there? Whats bad about it?
---
I never understand this point. I’ve only ever had one character, no mules, no alts I’ve ever sunk much time into, almost 900hrs in and played most days since launch. Been roleplaying as a vendor since the Fasnacht parade and have learned how to make a lot of caps each day separate from the 1400c. I buy things from NPC vendors, mainly plans. Been trying to get all plans since launch and still have plenty of plans to buy. Pretty much down to just power armor and mutation serum plans at this point, but that’s a lot of caps I can still sink into making my character more knowledgeable. I guess it’s all just how you play, but there are plenty of things to spend caps on.
---
Also, you could travel to some vendor camps and “tip” them. Buy something from them you don’t even need that matches an amount of caps you would want to gift them (and maybe even drop the item back on the ground for them to restock). Cause who cares, it’s fake currency that you have too much of. Give your caps to someone else, make their day!
---
Yeah of course.  Probably online later today or tomorrow. Will add you.
---
It's an AOE stimpaks, because the range of the team medic perk is just too disappointing.
---
I have been having the same issue.  I also have a ticket open with Bethesda.  They have had me do a number of things to make it go away.  I thought I had it, but it happen again today.
---
As a compromise, not a necessity.
---
And that's not what you suggested. You suggested an system to find you other players to do with. Which is possible but an impractical solution when it comes to coding an entire new system
---
There should be a way to hunt people, but it shouldn't be so seriously out of whack as pinpointing people on the map.
---
I am reminded of the hidden objectives, where you had to set your radio and search for where the signal was strongest. If you could set the radio to hunt the top player and had to go around manually hunting them, using the signal as a clue to home in on their position, while they would get a signal ping that someone was tracking them, so they could take the opportunity and make choices regarding their escape. rather than 5 minutes after someone above you dies being thrust to the immediate forefront and dog piled by a bunch of murderous lunatics.
---
Haha I love this! I’m on tomorrow for this. Where do I upload
---
Waste of resources. Barely anyone would even use that kind of stuff.
---
new playable dwarven race and ridable dragons, can make guilds now up to 50 people and build guild structures in towns 
---
oh and brothels have been added to every major city as well as public bathhouses
---
(PS4, non-pro) I played for 9 hours straight on the same server this past weekend and had almost all the workshops with no issues.
---
Are you by any chance running Norton or Malwarebytes?
---
I've given away a ton of decked out level 5 rifles in flatwoods. I used to go find new players and drop them each a care package of a fully done lvl 5 hunting rifle, 250 rounds of .308, 15 stimpacks, 15 radaway, 40 of raw leather/cloth/steel and about 50 bobby pins.
---
Looked at me like the huge gun toting schoolbus god, i looked at them as a useful way to empty my stashbox a bit.
---
Stabilized in intelligence is a staple
---
I've been see this patch 9 even before 9.5. It was interesting the pond south of white spring had no water. I could easily see the bottom and fish floating around but the water itself didn't load
---
If you ever find out anything else on the "ghost" items please let me know. I've lost a good bit of items when trying to place them anywhere near cliffs/rocks :(
---
I heard that Batman fights Shrek too
---
Your favorite image hosting service. I use Imgur.  Cant wait to see your character!
---
What heavy gun do you think I should look into buying with those effects
---
Nice armor/outfit combo! And my character has the same hair as you! I approve. 
---
Also, clever idea!
---
Yeah it's weird. I've found that a lot of locations won't trigger until I interact or loot something while in the area.
---
Well if you want go to the FO76 Filthy Casuals, we got plenty of people teaming up and helping each other out on all the platforms.
---
Oh I have plenty of challenging ones that involve less aliens and more carnage!
---
Precisely. This would be fine. Anything other than this really.
---
That's pretty badass.
---
Thanks! Post it up. And on the hair they don't really give us a ton of options. I'm kind of bummed about that
---
Hey, I have class tommorw and have Some stuff to do. I can give it to you tomorrow
---
I tagged the Scorchbeast Queen the other day, server lagged really bad (like froze and said something about a connection error for a solid minute) recovered, and I spent most of my time clearing adds just like you said, because it's important and most people ignore it.  Ended up not being able to loot the boss.  :(
---
Todd: Are they complaining again?
---
*looks at the camera*
---
***IT JUST FUCKING WORKS YOU FUCKING BABIES!***
---
no worries, I appreciate you trying :D
---
So the problem isn't the game but the fact that you are not playing, instead grinding and farming same spot... 
---
* Do daily guests
---
* start a new character (I have 3 at level 100 and about to start new one)
---
* Explore further than a 10 meter radius
---
* Buy stuff
---
* Play survival
---
* Use reasonable prices (I sell 3 star legendaries for 300-500 and plans for 25 no matter what they are, instead of people like you who sell purified water bottle for 300 caps and nocturnal lvl5 wooden leg armor for 3999 caps...)
---
* Help low level player like I do. I buy them gear and craft weapons and armor and give aid items
---
* Explore the world and settle down on new places, Base building is what this game is about not farming caps like you do... It costs 160 caps after first move
---
* Launch nukes (for fuck sake!) I hate high level player who only farm legendaries and steal other players loot instead of launching the nuke themselves (If done alone, costs around 5000 caps to do because ammo, repairing and healing...) or actually trying to kill legendary bosses. Most lvl 200 players only shoot once to get the drop and then run around stealing dropped loot while lvl 50 players try to take down lvl 30000 supermega legendary oneshotkill sheepsquach imposter
---
Try and you realize the game has too much cap sinks...
---
Wait.  Natural gas from Civil War mass graves?
---
That,  I don't think that's how natural gas works....
---
Perfect. I’ll set that up. Get some sleep. And see you tomorrow morning! (for my time zone at least)
---
yes. so many upvotes for this i have actually tagged and not gotten anything so many times its ridiculous.
---
Have pic just don't know hot to upload
---
I don't know. I once farmed mr gutsy in horde, but they were all normal. And they weren't really pleasant to farm, either.
---
That's not a bad setup. It's also a pretty well laid out idea too.
---
I guess it's the name but doesn't Bysshe sound like a chinese sounding name?
---
Damn Commies.
---
good to know but i have already tagged things and not gotten anything so i kinda see it? sort of? but i always use lower powered guns (usually a 45 pipe revolver rifle)
---
See, YOU keep saying WE as a collective as if you think you're important or the majority. But it's just you writing things over many peoples comments, attempting to poke holes in otherwise good idea that YOU don't like.
---
The post has already gained alot of traction, everyone is in favour of it becoming a world event notification. Bethesda DEVS already commented on here saying it's going to happen
---
" We (You) won't come to help you". Thanks, but WE don't need your help. You're not that special.
---
I really want this.  It would look great in my camp.
---
How does a company making money to continue to provide free, regular content updates and maintain their servers and yes... GASP... make money off of their intellectual property... come across as overtly greedy?
---
Being greedy because I'm using a decent weapon and build?  Stop making excuses for Bethesda.  The problem is the combat and reward flagging, not a player playing the game.
---
Have fun not getting loot until this stuff is changed.
---
my favorite qol changes are 
---
1. when seeing plans on the vendor it says known if you know it already. 
---
2. you can name power armor frames by inspecting it and choosing the rename option.
---
3. you can now run vendors out of your base and sell ammo.
---
4. they have expanded stash capacity twice.
---
5. servers got extremely stable and smooth. arktos came out, theyre still stable if you arent doing the event but they're  bit slower. still better than the early days by a long shot though.
---
6. removed a lot of duping and exploits, nerfed tse, continuing to balance pvp. its still broken af but theyre making the wannabe ops chase those goalposts hard. current broken exploit is tesla rifle apparently the splash damage bypasses all defenses and the meat hoot counts as both a gladiator perk and unarmed perk so peeps are abusing the heck out of that. oh also rifle and commando work on auto rifles. so dbags are running around with handmades and killing peeps in a few rounds. 
---
7. they eliminated base damage unless you or a teammate gets involved in pvp some how.
---
8. they eliminated cross map sniping and confined the pvp area to the workshop only.  so if you have a workbench and are off killing the queen a douchebag can't come up behind you and oneshot you with his exploited bloody meat hook. he can still get you when you go back but !
---
9. highest cap payout is 50 cps now per death. at level 240 that makes pvp less stressfull for me and i dont mind fighting back and dying as much now. its actually made trying a little more fun but im still at only a 20% win ratio. cause i still like power armor and laser gt both of with are not great for pvp.
---
Ya or dual black powder pistols, a 10mm and .44. Auto pipe and a pipe bolt action pistols, The good combos go on. Probably abit much to ask but both a melee and a ranged would be super tight.
---
You guys are under selling your fusion cores. I sell my 100% ones for 120 - 150cps.
---
Here it is alien in the um...well....flesh
---
It is being worked on.  They have talked about it several times in posts on there website.  I believe it has been pushed back to a later patch.  I also love the idea and look forward to it.  The last time they said something about display cases, but originally said you would be able to place items out of your stash around your camp.  I think the problem is making by it so people cant steal them lol
---
Huh? Sayin maybe he needed to have someone bring him a bunch of weapons so he could way them and see they not as heavy as they make em in game..
---
Whats protesting violence have anything to do with my statement?
---
But ill answer ya question anyways no i dont, regular country hick here, was in the military for a bit, family is military from my great grandparents down.. shoot several times a year. And have no problem with fightin someone when the need arises.
---
Plans are your loss leader... Got dang commie! You get them in the shop with a sale on metal chairs then you sell all your 10mm ammo cause what good is a new chair when you cant defend it!
---
Awesome. Thanks for the lead!
---
Finding other players to play with in a multiplayer game is absolutely not impractical, it is the backbone of multiplayer gaming...
---
By this do you mean you place down an item and it suddenly vanished? If placed on a camp surface like walls or floors, it may have teleported to the floor above or even the roof. If you look around and the item has completely vanished then you may need to remove the structure it was placed on.
---
However, if you placed an item on an immovable surface like the ground/rocks only for it to vanish, the only possible solution would be to relief and see if they returned. If not then these items can’t be regained and will possibly take up camp budget until Bethesda fixes it or they suddenly update and become visible and/or return to your storage.
---
I once joined an SBC fight where there was only 1 player there, the person who launched the nuke and was lvl 140, since I'm bored and was in the area i said why not, took my big guns and ammo from stash and headed over to the fight. As a bloodied build i was the one doing the most damage out of the 2 of us and im also the one that would have easily died a lot if not for the 3rd player showing up, a lvl 54 who had nothing but a PA chassis with a few miss matched pieces and a sledgehammer. 
---
That lvl 54 stood behind me and the other guy and tried whacking everything that got close to us as we focus fire on the queen, revived us every time we got on a downed state. That fight took forever, but we did it and its one of the most enjoyable SBQ fights i have been in.
---
It’s a glitch. As far as I know it doesn’t work anymore, but if you had them before they patched it you got to keep them.
---
Thanks! My husband calls everyone man, too, and even me once in a while so it’s cool ;)
---
Has anyone tried taking a pic next to a mounted alien, like the one in Van Lowe taxidermy in the broom closet?  Wondering if it might count...
---
I was at your vendors today!
---
Not a problem at all! We also have a discord you can jump on from the reddit group that you can join and find tons of people to join up with
---
Yeah, not sure how on earth this kind of announcement would be worth more than 5 seconds of time at E3... or how we even got to discussing E3 for that matter.
---
I’ll be on after 6AM till 8:30 AM EST
---
I went carnivore on both characters, even though I have planted corn. Good Doggy plus dog food is great.
---
Awesome!
---
A limit most won't hit.
---
I just happened upon this thread after logging off for today. I cleared West-tek before logging off, and the only legendary (two-starred) in the place dropped me a drill. 
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you, they should remove it from the legendary drop pool, or at least make it viable.
---
Ah, thanks! I’m on XB1, though. I actually have a 19 year old and when he has time he logs in and helps me out, too. I’m level 86 but it’s mostly from questing and crafting and killing things that get in my way.
---
Oh! No. I only got one. What’s the other one called?
---
nope no hats no shades I like only having that one item to favorite in order to avoid selling and or scrapping. I do occasionally get in the mood for head wear but it never lasts long before scrapping it on accident or just getting annoyed and tossing it. however since I learned you can inspect and rename things I can put the aaa mark in front and kick it to top of the list now I might consider new cloths.
---
Water purifiers. I saw one camp literally maxed out budget on them with enough generators for power. Collect every time you go to your base and sell off what you don't drink for easy caps
---
so i should blueprint any cool glitches i find?
---
Class Freak 3....
---
It’s frustrating sometimes, right? I will say that I appreciate the non-combat Tadpole challenges!
---
You can't have 6 or 7 money mules without having multiple accounts. This may be common for Reddit users but it's not common for the average player.
---
If that’s how it works.
---
IDK what your build looks like or what level you are, but I've solo'd Open Range many times with my pretty basic one-star bloodied Gatling gun power armor build and I could probably also do it with my very imperfect stealth commando build as well (just have never tried). The 'squatch is a bullet sponge, but the event is not impossible to do solo, even without god roll gear.  After you do it a few times, you kind of know what's going to spawn and where, and with a little strategy you can keep at least one of the Brahmin alive.
---
Roughly same day update came out or a day  or two later.
---
Can we possibly put things in display cases? Kinda annoying I have a really nice stainless steel display case with perfect glass and I can’t place anything in it. You could have it count towards your stash weight at half the cost. Same with magazine rack that would be cool. But yeah a keychain would be nice. Or instead of getting too many items to display on then screen and blurring out the last few with a ellipsis its a bit annoying to not know what I got. You could possibly just make it so that when an event is complete you go to the event and it displays what you got when selected. It would stay that way for 30 mins or so and then after would just leave your “actively completed events tab”  or an “event rewards tab”
---
Ah. I bought one a few months ago. It’s a lot of fun to use
---
I'm not asking a lot. The DC gauntlet is only lvl 30, but you can still one shot most things. The MM gauntlet is lvl 50, and is the same thing as my 'daily driver' for my unarmed build. I love that thing and feel that it reaches just a tad bit further than the DCG. Realistically, there's no difference because either one will one shot everything but scorchbeasts, sheepsquatch, and major bosses. Either one, 800 caps, fully upgraded and 200% health. I'm not really a 'business man' or PvP'r, just a guy trying to get funds to get other stuff, mainly PA plans. All of my builds incorporate no PA for normal activities and PA for times where a bloodied build isn't appropriate. I don't really like PA, but I know when to utilize it, I'm weird like that, but I must have it all because, well, options!
---
No, there is no point, attempting to place them down would just give you an error
---
Drink some Nukashine next time you see this
---
PC players seem to have a better time of it. They act like I'm a crazy liar (you're not obviously) whenever I mention how unstable the game still is. The stability is still pretty horrible for me. Crashes and disconnects are far too frequent. FO76 is the first online game I've played in years except for some Facebook stuff. The quality and standards have plummeted compared to first person shooters of nearly 20 years ago or what anyone would expect out of a published console game.
---
Hit them just once by any means, but not hard enough to kill them. It ensures that you get the rewards when they do finally die.
---
Yes! That’s how I try to play! It feels like real team work :)
---
Iv never crash, glitched or had a infinite loop or had quest not complete, lose gear, had my vendor reset inventory or most stuff I read on here. But I trust others have. Not everything happens to everyone, not 1 thing is alike
---
I do agree with you on this. This I believe it should've been in the game from the beginning. But it's an impractical (requires alot of work) temporary solution for something that a possible simple solution.
---
Alot of prominent bugs fall through the cracks each update. Something like what you've proposed would be released with bells and whistles as a new feature.
---
Life sometimes ain't perfect. Not sure if u remember gaming in the 90s and early 2000s. But we got it good, 5 min ain't that long.
---
Both
---
I tried again today and it doesnt work yet
---
Our enemies barely spawned and din't drop kelp.
---
Darn, fair enough. Hopefully this bug gets fixed soon!
---
I would appreciate it, my gamertag is SPARKYWOLF123. When might you next be planning on getting on?
---
But killing the horde boss is the main objective are you asking me to not play the objective?
---
Game has backstory instead of story
---
it didnt work before when i shot the lvl 100 3\* in project paradise
---
When you level past 50 you get to choose to reallocate a special point or choose a new perk card. It's not meant to be a respec - it's inteded to let you tweak your character
---
Im on PS4 and I was with a group of people jumping servers to do the event together. We all froze like 3 times on different servers. So I think it's bugged.
---
As for the "Roofs/Floors above stairs" I think you can put one of the metal pillar supports down on the stairs (It should snap somewheres to it) and that will allow you to put stuff above the stairs. I had to do this when I started playing 2 weeks ago and had rebuilt my camp the last few days but can't remember if it was after this last patch.
---
I never worry about the dailies I find them tedious. I just log in and do what ever and challenges happen on accident. or they don't. its whatever.
---
It’s Fallout, have you ever seen a Deathclaw near Hiroshima?
---
That was my belief also?
---
Lol id share the pic if I knew how... You'd think there would be an button for that
---
That was West Tek, testing FEV formulas. They also made the Snally.
---
ikr
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 my friend! I hate when it happens, anyway I’m sorry to hear about that. I either deal with it and make it looks nice or start all over.
---
Anybody who tags the enemy gets to loot it. Enemy loot is player-instanced, and so are now containers and flora (but they have a cool-down period now). Only time I remember something on an enemy being world-instanced was back when hardened mass on a dead body disappeared when someone had looted it.
---
Legendary loots are player-specific. AFAIK, even the rolls of the legendary are player-specific. Your friend might find a 1\* auto-stim wood left arm but you might find a bloodied explosive faster fire rate 50 cal.
---
Also, tagging the SBQ is not guaranteed for loot. I have been in several fights with the SBQ where I have not received any loot whenever there is a player that can do ridiculous damage to the SBQ (like 140% of her 150% health). It seems like you have to make enough damage proportional to the player that has made the most damage in order to get loot.
---
I went with herbivore - having corn planted and easy access to water means I can create a lot of food very easily, and without much trouble
---
Definitely go for the 2\* ranged, it's cheaper and I've had some good ones. Maybe the odds are better too, there are more combinations of effects with 3\* compared to 2\*.
---
QE handmade, AAE black powder rifle, B25 railway, I25 railway, BCrit50 laser, F25 gatling gun, B25 Gatling laser, ME assault rifle, ME 10mm pistol, FE black powder pistol, TS25 gatling plasma
---
I agree, the leaderboard is why I wont touch Survival anymore, its not worth my time when someone can just pop out of no where and gank me because they know my location but I don't know there's
---
No, you just have to be up their ass for it to count
---
I like them there - its my favorite place to go sell. I can get my sell on at the robot npc then mosy over and see what the player vendors got. I dont build there myself though because its hard to get a camp to spawn there at time. so my vendor is in bfe and hardly sells anything but i dont really need the caps and i have plenty.
---
As a casual player who is always broke using caps to respec would really suck.
---
Yessssssw!!!!
---
I find I need to get extremely close to both of those for the pictures to count. The name should appear in the upper righthand corner.
---
No they said they were going to have it to where you could place items from your stash around your camp as decoration. Display cases are something different than that (bobble heads, magazines) they said they were pushing it back and releasing it 2 weeks after patch 9 but they never said anything again about being able to place things around your camp from your stash. That should be completely different than display cases since people wanted to put their nuka colas in the nuka cola machine.
---
Looks great, but it needs more lights!
---
Yup, same here. Had to literally scrounge and fight for everything. I remember having play sessions without any aid and having to fight mutties with a pipe pistol only so i can drink from the river.
---
Now you see a newbie lvl 10 running around with a TS pump along with an endless supply of aid. 
---
They got it made if you ask me.
---
I love that it's written in a way that makes the goal to kill the queen as soon as possible.
---
Sorry I don’t have any hard evidence.
---
While it may be a coincidence there’s also a few reasons why I don’t think it is
---
Both were the same level
---
Both had the same amount of health taken off
---
My camp is in the forest.
---
Now I think I know why, there’s a glitch in this game and Skyrim where after you kill a dragon/ scorchbeast then teleport. The corpse of the animal will teleport with you. My theory is that it did this glitch, but somehow hole it was alive.
---
Off topic- Thankyou for you constant activity within the community. 
---
And just throwing it out there. I believe the Starlet Sniper hat appearing alone in the atom shop could be a good seller.
---
in fact I had a couple mutations I wanted to get rid of "unstable isotope and electrically charged" I didnt get rid of them because I didn't want to try and replace other mutations but I found a vendor with all of each for 500 per. so I edited my mutations and bought replacements right there for a good price. it was good.
---
Same for every language... This requires a Hotfix, if you ask me. We can't complete our Opossum challenges. But hey, we have an airport called "automatic receiver" now.
---
I was face to face with them after scaling a cliff. :( possibly bugged for me. Wouldn't be first time.
---
I always do if it is a team mates first time. Or if it was a spectacularly fun battle, which does happen sometimes.
---
I totally agree with you. This is the worst fallout ever. Fuck Bethesda. They couldn't program a mouse turd right.
---
I was thinking of doing just that, thank you. Just didnt wanna go to through the effort if it was bugged.
---
I understand your point, and I’m considering it :) Never said you were crazy or anything like that, hey don’t worry!
---
Were you?! Was my prices affordable?? Lol still trying to gauge the game economy atm
---
Yeah I agree
---
*continues to play often*
---
I sell adrenal reaction along with other serums for 275 caps. I'll be on in about 4 hrs. PSN Raiders398.
---
Don’t call me
---
Hey there! could you please make one for me too? I would really apreciate I been trying to get it since they added but no luck.
---
Sorry again for the ping, I appreciate you passing this info along! I should be the one thanking you!
---
It would be more of a camp object is what I have in mind.
---
Going into the build menu and selecting them. It doesn't have to pull from your stash but it would make camps for more "lived in" if someone could place say a stack of nuka colas on a counter. Or a stack of ammo boxes by a supply box.
---
There is no scorchbeast, only Zuul!
---
Do you have every plan so far ? If not there is your cap sink. That is my  cap sink sense day 1. Every time I'm near 23k I spend 18k on plans and then do it again.
---
I know right they get anything they want back in the one days this game was fun now you just have a new generation that complains about everything it was there fault they nerfed everything the game was fun before but now you can get banded for swering ya know
---
Im pretty sure i didnt have to wait 5minutes for invisible enemies to respawn. Nor did i wait 5 minutes for anything to load.
---
Hell yeah... Unyielding Sentinal too... WTF
---
*Toots in Fasnacht!*
---
Yeah. I haven't ever seen a 3 star wood piece... But if there is ever one you wanted that would be it.
---
The number of surviving cows affect the reward table. You get weapon plans only if 2 or more cows are alive at end.
---
Same as the new Arktos rewards with better loot on number of defend targets alive.
---
I was making an undercutting joke. I'd prob sell a staff at 500 for novelty.
---
Does this spawn an infinite amount of legendaries then or is there a limit?
---
I planned on scripping it but the server kicked me not long after I got it... Of course
---
Would it be possible to get a map of all doors? I want to see if there are any bunkers or basements I missed. Thanks!
---
100 caps for the plans or the actual diffusers? That is alot for the diffuser.
---
That was awesome. You guys look like you had fun doing this video.
---
That would be amazing! Been saying this since launch!
---
How is the script exchanged for legendaries higher than legendaries exchanged for script?
---
I had literally left for five seconds and our Yao Guai got killed so then I gave up and just started to attack the squatch, got killed, and respawned outside the building. Body and meatpile were gone, got nothing out of it, was pretty angry to say the least when I was the only one protecting.
---
No word on those display cases? The ones talked about in the first Wild Appalachia ITV?
---
Hopefully they screw up soon and allow some sort of massive fuck up IN OUR FAVOUR for once
---
It's worse than it was in F04!
---
Getting at least one shot or hit in on an enemy, so you get credit for helping to kill it when it dies!
---
Wish you could play on a server without Chad showing up to ruin the party.
---
I had to take the Munition Factory and rebuilt the Vertibot pad, and did Collision Course at Morgantown Airport for the Cargobot. Both stay still, one of them seems like forever so you should have plenty of time 😉
---
Sweet I'll add you as soon I get home and online 😋
---
Yeah why is that? The only 2* sheepsquatch ive ever encountered was in the wild.
---
No worries
---
That was how I got count for my cargo bot
---
The Vertibot was an amazing feat of luck and athleticism combined with Marsupial, haha
---
Aka, lucky pic off a high place when it dipped low... xD
---
Do what now? They did what with my over repair? Well RIP my other character. I was doing 220 dam per tick with my bloody ripper. Now it's balls you say?
---
Can't believe you got downvoted for this. This is hilarious and spot on.
---
That's me. I was south of whitespring at the junk node and I got sick and tired of having to fight over my camp. I moved near monongah no water, no resource node. nothing but me and my watermelon patch. watermelons take care of food and water and my camp has been there every single time since that move. also monongah power plant is in reach of artillary which is fun for defense. not very usefull. but fun to try and use it . it adds a nice chaotic element to the standard defense. I like my work shop defenses structured and efficient but also to look like more than a stack of turrets. I add a workbench or two a small bunk house, then the artillary strikes adding a touch of chaos adds a bow on top. it is literally digital living art. now if people would just start paying me i could do it full time.
---
Handwaving it as AK-101 derivative (an AK chambered in 5.56mm NATO) would help alleviate your friend's sanity.
---
I've heard rumors of a 3* but since that is never a guaranteed 3* drop it still isn't really worth worrying about, focus on getting the event done for the plans!
---
I recall them dropping hints about wanting to rework the entire item storage system. Maybe this is why.
---
Wait, I thought a 25 pound weight weighs 6.3 with Pack Rat 3.
---
Yeah I know the feeling all to well, initially we did really well. I mean I was the only one collecting venison and depositing it, but when the Yao Guai showed up there were 3 of us protecting it. But then the SS appeared and they all left again
---
Loot pool yes. Legendary loot pool no. Your idea is to include every instance of every weapon in the loot pool. 3star alpha sheepsquatch? You get a switchblade. Congrats. Don't spend it all in one 0lace.
---
Dont mess with the Zoltan
---
I don't think I am special at all. If you guys didn't need help you wouldn't even be asking for this feature so whatever.
---
Just keep your selfish calls for loot off our screens please
---
When it comes to jumping while placing wires, I have had limited success doing any of three things, usually in this order:
---
1. Trying to connect from the other connection back to the one you originally started with (instead of C1--&gt;C2 do C2--&gt;C1). This is object-specific, so if this doesn't fix it, then you can move on to either of the other two.
---
2. Pick up and place the object. I've had limited success with this, but it has worked.
---
3. Store the object and place it again. Limited success with this as well.
---
These don't work every time, but I have had them work.
---
(What is the Scorchbeast version of Dracarys?)
---
My friends and I have joked about this and I totally agree!
---
Not an issue. I'm on now, and will be for a couple hours tonight.
---
Yeah I just found out they changed it. Previously people tried all the fake aliens to try and get that to count
---
I would like to point out that the legendary scrip machines do not accept drills and syringers. That means that a proper legendary pool (=all the stuff you can scrip) already exists in the game. At this point it seems almost certain that drills and syringers dropping from legendary enemies is a intended feature.
---
Nope, the reason why I don't touch survive is it's not locked to a character. So I can hop over to Adventure, gather supplies, craft ammo, repair guns, build up my defence. Then hop back over, fully loaded and zero consequences. That not survival...
---
especially with people wearing backpacks and plasma gatling
---
Yeah thats why i dont use mic, i cuss a lot and back when you can slap people i didnt want them hearing me laugh as they went for the trap but aren't there yet. Oh those dark old days, now to think of it, i was such a bad boy......
---
It could cost materials and use budget just like every other camp object. Doesn't seem that out of reach.
---
That's what I said. I wonder if they are **supposed** to.
---
They also spawn under the stairs in the corners and often get stuck there until you go get them out.
---
It's like, the event is good on paper, one of the best few events to bring a group of people from the server. But like, the execution seems to be lacking. It's lacking a good adhesive that makes it a coherent event. The first few hours were confusing for a lot of people, didn't know what to do/etc but now I feel like a lot of people only stick around for the Alpha. It gets frustrating to deal with, especially when we've had our animals walk right into the Alpha other times and basically commit suicide.
---
When an event has 10+ people with guns that can 1 shot an enemy, the mechanics of tagging for loot just doesn’t make sense. I’ve been saying this for months. Every person in the event should be able to loot every creature that spawns regardless of tagging it. Being forced to tag an enemy for loot breaks the teamwork required to successfully finish an event. Especially when we are being forced to protect and escort shit. Everyone drops what they’re doing and runs to the legendary that spawned to ensure loot and everything dies and we ALL fail. So stupid
---
Yeah since most i got from em were some freakin pipe wrenches and wood, i just mainly do it to use up my 5mm.
---
I've been selling weight reduction armor for 300 - 500 caps. 
---
Best deals I've found have been a bloody explosive harpoon gun and a level 5 explosive hunting rifle both for under 1000 caps.
---
If Player Y was good at Survival, it doesn't follow that Player Y would need to attack in Adventure mode.
---
\&gt;also why can‘t i upload pictures directly??
---
I can't say specifically for this subreddit, but others do it because allowing images can be low effort posts, and are typically more likely to be upvoted than a discussion post.  Take a look at subs such as r/pokemon r/dnd or r/games 
---
there are ways around it but it tries to keep the chafe down.
---
Absolutely true. It is a terrible idea that would ruin shopping. 
---
People just need to learn to manage their stash better. I was told you couldn't manage with 400 stash at high levels and it was a lie.
---
I prefer it grilled.
---
&gt;I really needed 76 to be good.
---
Great news--it is!
---
Exactly
---
Same here I found away to kill people with out them attacking me
---
Lmao other than the meat pie this is pretty much a list of the top 10 things I keep stocked in my vanding machine. Guess I am doing something right.
---
This is offtopic. Go make your own post.
---
Wow! Can you PM me your username? I'd love to buy one of those off you tomorrow
---
Dammit Chad!
---
 So they tell me. The knives have suffered but not like the V Fast, I would imagine. I got a Mr Handy in the 60s, but it was just play. My knives I love. ;)
---
I do batman.... Na Na Na na na bat queen
---
This is the most interesting C.A.M.P Ive seen in a while; how did you accomplish the underground look? (IE: Dirt, roots, etc)
---
I'm hoping for kits that add stars. Weight reduction freezing etc. Still can't get a weapon with incendiary except the Perfect Storm. Hopefully they add a slew of cool mods so we can have that perfect 5* weapon.
---
Hard to say. You're eventually gonna run out of bullets or stimpacks. Or Chad is gonna come along and kill the boss.
---
agreed !! and well said.. WE NEED MORE STASH SPACE.. for fuck sake.
---
“More variety for the building game is a bad thing”?
---
They should have a 50 cal lmg mod
---
This is an awesome idea! Now I’m sad it’s not already a thing...
---
Does the server you're on affect the RNG too?  Sometimes I've had 2 or 3 good weapons in a row, other times 5 out of 5 is trash. There are no enemies, so I guess no loot tables, but I'd like to see their code lol.
---
But you could always launch the game from a shortcut to the executable in the game files bypassing the launcher.
---
Probably just no 7.62 ammo
---
7 titanium, and 6 ballistic fiber. Everything else is common
---
Razor grain soup is better then corn soup (as it heals much more).
---
Herbivore if- you want to assign one item as water, food and healing under one quick button
---
Carnivore if- you rarely visit your camp/ you don't like harvesting and cooking, you don't mind eating random meat from pip boy and using boiled or purified water separately.
---
Ozymandias speaks of doing something for the betterment of everything/one, despite the drastic measures/lengths one must go through to attain it. Pretty much the story of Fallout. Everyone thought using all these limited natural resources to push the limit of what human industry can achieve is great--and in a lot of ways it is, in a lot of ways it's not.
---
"Look at my works, ye mighty and despair!"
---
Did he say it in his *SOOTHING VOICE*?
---
&gt;If every person took 50 photos that’s almost 117,000 people.
---
Every person had not taken 50 photos. There are way more than 117,000 players. Contrast to what you might hear on YouTube or r/Fallout, the game is not, and has not ever been, on the verge of dying due to lack of players.
---
Yeah well, I think it just comes down to the amount of people participating, if you have ~3 in each area, you can attract the right animals and defend them. Maybe a couple more come in later to help with the Alpha and you should be alright. The hard part is when you die and spawn outside Arktos, it's almost impossible to get back inside within a good timeframe...
---
Yes please
---
Disagreement is off topic? You don't want a heathy discussion on survival-mode. Ok 👋
---
“RUN FOR IT, MARTY!”
---
I’ll take a two shot syringer any day. Stack that bleed damage baby
---
Put the machines in a separate building with one wall open when your close to cap limit turn off power and pop in a wall so there not accessible.
---
What pisses me off is you can use a shutdown code to stop the bots from respawning, but sometimes it just quits working. This is THE most broken new piece of content they have yet released. I crash from the server on 5/10 attempts. Some people can't even access the elevator without crashing. Half the time you are dealing with invisible enemies, and the stuff to fill the food troughs won't re-spawn properly. It's a complete mess. They need to hotfix it as soon as possible. I have wasted HOURS just trying to get a damn Stimpak Diffuser plan, which of you will remember has already been an unobtainable requirement for a MONTH for the LAST piece of content.
---
relevant to my interests. i am in the exact same situation.
---
You talking about back then or now? Because now its just the trap bases that are trolling.
---
Upload to imgur, then paste link here.
---
Just to keep awareness going, same here. Xbox One, haven't been able to do any Mire Dailies since Patch 7.
---
Is it possible the vendor is linked to your luck skill?
---
so you have to hope your camp location is open every time you log in?
---
Apparently there’s two in Fort Defiance
---
This isn't what we're talking about! You're talking about something COMPLETELY different.
---
a dead body would release various gases as it undergoes decay. Sure, it's not "natural" gas with a capital N, but imagine a mass grave releasing gases at the same time...
---
Any capitalist gas company would want a hit, especially in a fictional world like Fallout's.
---
No it's why we need fridge
---
no, as in when you attempt to use the blueprint you will fail, due to it building the items as new ones
---
It's actually English.
---
Lol just commented on thinking they will add legendary mods like incendiary weight reduc etc. They already have poison mods for machetes so hopefully we can get ss  as well.
---
I did particularly like the brothels👍
---
What I was getting at is that the gasses would just escape into the atmosphere, they wouldn't be trapped.
---
no shit. what led you to believe this would be anything like fallout 1&amp;2?
---
It’s actually really simple to achieve. Figure out what sells. Buy low and sell high. I would suggest a basic business course. It applies to many aspects of life.
---
Maybe for a fat wad of scrip the purveyor's choice will be a legendary mod!
---
They overdid it. Thing is, that is nominal damage. That damage gets split across all pellets hitting. So high level enemies with high resistances, absorb a great deal of that damage.
---
My IE combat shotgun is now about as good as 10mm explosive pistol. Slightly better, but the ammo is more expensive/resource intense, and the weapon weights a heck more.
---
AA E might have survived that nerf somewhat OK, but pretty much others didn't.
---
How hard is it? What level should I be? I'm lol 76. I use an instigating dragon, TS assault, and a limb damage lever action. Not an OP character. Would I be able to do well or should I just wait it out?
---
Dont suppose there's a place with all 4 in one place or atleast really close by?
---
Unless you use harpoons ;)
---
I already have this setup. But when you are a few thousand away from the cap limit, a single player can max you out quickly. During events people like to stock up and I can’t drop everything to flip the switch.
---
I'd like that too, but even then the damage would be awful. 60 damage over 10 seconds with the bleedout barrel or 80 over 10 seconds with the radscorpion barrel. Even after armor penetration, a single shot from a hardened handmade would have the same effect
---
It's never been particularly bad since launch, but it really seems like it's gotten better. I've had honestly nothing but good interactions in months, especially since player vending. People are even being better about tagging and letting people get shots in during events.
---
I still can't believe how far the game has come. It's still a buggy mess, but at least it's a fun buggy mess.
---
I also just love the enemies sliding along the floor to attack you. Please never fix that, Bethesda. It never fails to crack me up, fighting a horde of ghouls and here comes a slick boi sliding across the ground to bite my ankles.
---
If I remember right bleeds and poison ignore armor. Snipe from far away then chip it down as the beast approaches!
---
Or is my mind in the wrong place with that armor thing?
---
Or keep rolling the 2's then *trade* the better ones that don't fit your build for 2's or 3's that do fit it.
---
If you're doing a medic build, a flamethrower is a good weapon to have. There's a skill where when you're on a team you can flame your allies and it heals them.
---
Get rid of the leader board and maybe let us set a bounty from the server list!
---
Too bad. I’d love a 50% reload syringer.
---
You got the blackbird paint?
---
off topic: i just wanna ask how you guys got those "cult of the mothman" badges(?) on your usernames here on reddit?
---
This is fantastic
---
Mostly I just don't realize I'm at the top or being hunted. So it's pretty much the system before they changed it to kill count.
---
i mean you can't re-place your camp at all with things like that?
---
[deleted]
---
Sad thing I'd this is why they added the fixer so you can sneak everywhere for 2 his lol
---
Yeah I have like 5.5k .38 ammo so I want a decent 3* to use when I’m just exploring.
---
any glitched setups that where patched are unable to be re-created if they are removed, or if you relocate your camp
---
nah but you have to be close enough for a little label to show up in the top right corner. 
---
also it has to be “alive”, like active and operational. 
---
it can’t be like the crashed vertibird in watoga or the wrecked cargobot in arktos
---
Unfortunately it's intentional Bethesda said it themselves that machines will keep selling and you will just get nothing as they are worry about inflation. This and 10% tax is there to stop inflation. I don't think it's the way to go but that's the best they could figure out.
---
Store all caps on alt that's what I'm doing.
---
Everything should be instanced. It gets frustrating having some guy in excavator armor do absolutely nothing and get all the rewards while me and my friends destroy the boss.
---
Spent 2000 caps moving my camp over and over until it stopped happening. Lol.
---
One big downside of fast travel is missing things like this
---
It does ignore armor, but my point is that even with armor reduction for the guns, they would be vastly better. Chipping away at them with a level 5 10mm pistol or pipe gun would kill them faster than a two-shot radscorpion syringer
---
Herbavore I eat melons , I no longer cook anything
---
With bear arms each weapon weighs around 2, so I carry 5 or so to give myself options depending on my situation. The .50 machine gun burns through ammo the slowest so that would be a decent pace to start maybe? Although with bandolier 5mm ammo is weightless. 
---
(I carry an AAE minigun, AAE lmg, action hero, vampire.50 mg, TS auto grenade launcher for a weight of 10)
---
Great caps sink Bethesda!
---
Hahahaha true true. They need to bring back the non damage syringes. Sleep, fury, and paralysis.
---
I think they want to draw more people to the mode. Survival games usually don't have leaderboards that mark you on the map. Its a cool spin off but I like player kill count better just need to fixe the bug that put you on without kills.
---
I've noticed, on the jumping when placing a wire bug, if you go to the other end of what you're trying to connect, it works. Don't ask why
---
That’s when you turn that person off and talk to somebody else.
---
I don't even want free shit I just want people to play with, the game tends to get lonely without other people to play with. I'm down to add ya, but I'm a level 12, if you could me level up quick that'd be great 😩
---
I like that idea. I leave my door open for players to browse my vendors. A couple players have dropped some food or water as thanks and some guy even dropped a sheepsquatch skull. That also makes me wish we could place inventory items around as decorations.
---
16 times the detail
---
We have the endangerol, but it's just not worth using most of the time. That's also just a support role for the weapon, there's no good way of dealing damage with just the syringer
---
Same! I found amazing CAMP, so much that I really wanted to leave them some gifts!
---
If you run bloodied build even couple rads can give you empath if you forget starched genes
---
Fort Defiance. It's on the 4th floor.
---
Maybe use the hunter hunted circle and verbally alert you when you enter the top 3 with a purge siren or something lol
---
what’s the point of having the zoom function on the camera if it doesn’t help identify things in the viewfinder?
---
Good luck actually getting photos of those. It's not a "photo with it in the frame" it's "a photo with the  name tagged" and the range on the camera flat out isn't good enough to catch them. The camera, itself, is badly implemented, not this challenge.
---
Get the damage buffs for heavy guns in strength, one gun army in agility and there's stabilized in intelligence if you're into power armor. Then imo a nice bloodied or exploding gatling gun should do the trick since .50 cal is just too weak rn and we don't talk about the minigun. 
---
Don't know much about explosive heavy guns or energy based so I can only give advice about ballistic heavy guns.
---
It still baffles me when other sell for so high. The ⭐gear can be scrip easily since it's common. Get enough scrip and you get a good item. Players tend to go for the ⭐⭐/⭐⭐⭐ since it has most effects. I know the ⭐ has a good effect but many want to stack alot because it gives them more buffs. All armor x 3 = 15 effects that can do alot of good in many situations.
---
I would a actively play survival if aid items didnt drop on death, that's my only gripe with it.
---
Actually I'd be good with food, water and chems like buffout and what not dropping, just dont touch my stimpaks, rad-x, radaway, and antibiotics...
---
now you're asking too much lol
---
In all honesty the only REAL foundation building is the entrance doorway (which takes a few tries to line-up right), the living room (this is also alittle tricky, to set the elevation of the foundation just right, as to not hit your head on the ceiling), and the barrier separating me from the rest of the tunnel. 
---
Other than that, the rest is vanilla game scenery
---
What if I wear clothes over my armor?
---
Any idea what it’s called?
---
They need to make survival independent from adventure, then I'll play it.
---
Eh unlikely
---
How is this relevant to crouch walking faster? It's not. We're talking about GPS location not the sneak system.
---
Like my deathclaw topiary that I can't place now that I moved my camp
---
No, definitely not.
---
Yeah u would fair well in the event but try not to get yourself overwhelmed as enemies spawn fast and in huge numbers. Don't even bother with the event if u see no one else is there.
---
Similar time - I’ve seen it, but for .5 seconds - fast travelling to the north of the map and spotted it only for it to disappear.
---
Depend on your build, for me it's the second to worst mutation or even the worst one. It makes your stims useless during combat and heals you out of combat when you don't need any healing. 
---
Perk description is totally wrong it should say:
---
Rapid healing out of combat and no enemies nearby, reduce effect of all chems including stims
---
also is there some ammo factory i can claim because i need a lot of 5.56 ammo
---
Lolol watched that too still accidentally kill him every time.
---
?
---
Where do I join the event? Is it only active at certain times or is it like the event in Harper's ferry where you can do it any time?
---
From early game of thrones; I think you should wear your [power] armor tonight, sir.
---
I Love not being able to fast travel, not see other players on the map, and unrestricted pvp... I just dont like losing important items. Then again that's why I stick to adventure until I go for the survival legendaries.
---
Can confirm. I primarily use the plasma gatling right now and while it doesnt happen every time, it does happen. Seems to happen primarily to valuable enemies (legendaries and big beasties.)
---
I'll be on tomorrow morning from about 7:30 am or so until around 11 am before work. That's central US time. I'm level 24 but I have plenty of legendary weapons and armor, tons of chems and ammo, a good amount of plans and mods, and would love to trade or sell my stuff for fair prices. My PSN is FkU_ImtheSandman
---
I have my camp 5 caps from camp venture but I still get very few visitors. I also don't have any weapons or armor so I guess that hurts my prospects. I have tons of ammo, though...
---
Planning to set up some sort of roadside Gas Station/Trading post specifically in the forest area, perhaps any suggestions as to where to set up camp?
---
I tried being down south but barely got any attention. Being in the middle or near a location that is common will make your camp noticed.
---
Ammosmith and super duper will give you 36 round of 5.56 for every 12 steel, farming a few hundred steel should only take around half an hour max. What platform are you on?
---
I tried I can't drop or trade it.
---
I've gone with next to Watoga train station for now, thanks! The land is flat enough but it turns out an 8x8 square only just barely fits in the build area. So I'm kind of able to do my plan but not much else.
---
And 3 and NV and 4
---
Yeah a few times
---
Depending on how hard it is, or if you have made it this far. You could always travel south-east to Watoga and complete the "Mayor for a Day" quest and make the robots non-hostel.
---
PROS:: Robots to pick and fight for exp, power armor pieces to keep and sell, and "All-Rise" a unique Super-Sledge that is very useful in early game.
---
CONS:: Robots are hostel until quest completion, cranberry bog is hard for new players, and "All-Rise" scales to level so you may want to wait to get a better version of this weapon.
---
It will, but muh lead deposit
---
Currently Arktos Pharma is a good location. You have roads around there and you can find water. I will see if I can find a location for you real quick.
---
Oh yeah. He likes to run his damn mouth. Pay him no mind.
---
That's fine man! Some people have some really cool clothes that I've never seen before I'd love to see some different outfits.
---
360 hours and I’ve only seen the Flatwoods monster twice
---
Can we buy a skin that will make the drill ACTUALLY BE WORTH HAVING ?
---
No bounty from server list. I shit you not id always have a bounty because haters everywhere would set my bounty lol. This would be a nightmare of a mechanic and would basically be the same thing as leaderboards.
---
Oh that's rough...
---
it approached me once and I shot it in the face
---
Ok. Was just wondering if anyone else had come across him.
---
That's not entirely true, chameleon bonus to sneak always work, invisibility only when stationary, invisibility doesn't matter for pve. Basically for pvp use one piece and wherever other armour you need, for pve use multiple pieces or mix with unyielding (as agility help with sneaking) but unyielding isn't as good as chameleon.
---
Ugh but that isnt what we are talking about we are talking about survival leaderboards. make your own post about that.
---
Appreciate the quick response man, was thinking about placing it perhaps a little outside of Morgantown on one of the roads or down near Summersville. May not be a hub but god damn those views are amazing.
---
Were you able to kill it?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
No problem and they are great to have a place at.
---
Will add. Sooner or later we will all hook up.
---
Ohhh, that’s fun!
---
Yeah but once the 10min loading was done the game actually worked
---
Honestly there is too much new stuff to describe.   You may want to Google the “Roadmap” and see what calls to you.
---
Yes of course. That’s what the game is about.
---
Lol not even close l! Would make for some fun though!
---
I just dropped like 500 rubber I didn't realise
---
I accumulated and filling my stash box... There's uses for rubber? Like apart from the odd scrap
---
Scrapping weapons yields rubber I’m pretty sure the assault rifle gives rubber when scrapped to start with
---
Pick up golf clubs at whitesprings, each one nets 1 rubber, 1 plastic, 2 steel. Tyler fairgrounds has 5-10 basketballs, and tons of plastic from cups.
---
Agreed but like anything people will abuse it only to me the benefits to the proper players would out weigh this, I enjoy selling gear I may not want but someone else will "one mans treasure and all that" but to me it is a constant grind keeping my normal stash under control never mind trying to juggle selling gear tagged to my stash, so I think having a seperate limit maybe smaller in size but enough to allow you to sell certain gear would make the game more enjoyable.
---
&gt;the difference between a .308 and a .50 cal
---
If you are talking about .308 and .50 cal doing the same damage in game that was changed a few updates ago.
---
Yeah. Sorry if it came off harsh. Lol. This guy likes to give me problems all the time.
---
The high school gym in grafton .. loaded with basketballs make sure to go into the closet too
---
Yes, strength will increase carry weight and melee damage, perception increase vats chance, endurance increase resistances to disease charisa better prices, intelligence durability of crafted gear, agility more AP, and luck durability of found gear
---
yeah it died in one hit
---
Aye, thinking of maybe having it span across the road in Morgantown across from the Diner there, only thing is don’t want to deal with Scorched spawning across the street and fucking shit up.
---
There's a new player vendor system, Players can take items from their stash and put them up for sale, That update saved my game. There's also a new "Boy Scout" update that grants a backpack which increases your carry weight, Although the challenges to get it are crazy as shit
---
Overall, If you played the game at release and didn't touch it again until now (Like me) it's a completely different game
---
Dude, people would log in to the server, see me, set a bounty. This would be worse than server leaderboards for many people.
---
10/10 imagine if they did this as the reveal video last year...
---
Screws?
---
Awesome stuff. Like the sound of it. 
---
And yeah that's pretty much been the case for me. Played a decent amount at release and just stopped.
---
I end up either dropping my 40mm or if I pick up an auto gl I'll use em. Mine were at one cap. The only ammo I sell above one cap is Shells, 2mm EC, and cryo. Just since they're rarer and more expensive to craft. But the 40mm are just too heavy to have sitting around in my stash.
---
I’ve had it happen to me once or twice on the imposter sheepsquatch, jailbreak, and the real sheepsquatch Brahmin event. Isn’t fun..
---
I found one that looks promising. Is it across from Slocum Joe's
---
Here have a vote my good sir
---
Sometimes I've noticed when it's a bad server, nothing I do in that server counts. The game forgets Everything I did in those few minutes I was in that server.
---
I see. So all these high lvl people are just filling out all the cards so they can change builds in a couple of lvls? Actually if i wanted to go melee build it would take 14 lvls just to get strength up. And then i would have to get the cards on top of that?! Seems a bit steep if that is the case.
---
ya i got 4 .dmp files
---
Once I hit weight caps and hit lvl 50 the game kinda went stale, I only have myself to blame for getting burned out tho cause me and a friend hit lvl 50 within the first 48 hours (On new characters) 
---
So the Vendors is a breath of fresh air. OH AND I ALMOST FORGOT, There's a Legendary Vendor in Berkeley that allows you to scrap legendaries that you don't want (To an extent)
---
That's exactly how I am. If I make nothing from my vending, I'll just go back to selling to bots. I'm not moving off my lead deposit, though. I normally pay my friends in lead for items/plans they have since I always have a surplus, but I never run out of ammo. And I can focus on farming gunpowder instead of acid or lead, which I feel is easier to find.
---
All in all, I'm very over under with vending. I'm back down to around 3k caps. Oh well.
---
Yo dude I'm about to sign in if you still want one
---
Patch notes say it works. Nuke zone or rad storm
---
Well the Japanese weren’t experimenting with salamanders and FEV at the time...
---
Or were they?
---
Heck yeah. My ign is Rlauntz53
---
&gt; people were still here acting like it was completely out of line that an online Fallout game had bugs at launch 
---
See, it's comment like this that are unrepresentative of the reality of the situation that is the problem. This comes off sounding apologist.
---
Bethethda launched a game WELL before it was ready, the "beta" period was way too short, none of the problems that arose were fix in the zero day "patch", the fact that while mired with a slew of bugs and issues Atom store updates were coming not only consistently but any problems with the atom store were seemingly prioritised in fixing their issues (prevalent even today if the atom store topiaries are anything to go by). 
---
That barely even scratches the surface of issues back then.
---
Until FoV sliders and turning off DoF was implemented, for some people the game was literally "literally unplayable".
---
Let's not downplay the issues at launch. Yes I agree it was overhyped by the community (though BGS has some part to play with that during their E3 presentation). Also agree that outrage culture is an issue. 
---
However, in the same way I don't lump you into the blind fanboy zealots that can see no wrong despite a tsunami of evidence to the contrary, legitimate critique (of which there was a ton back then and thankfully has lessened over time) shouldn't be written off as feeding into the "outrage culture".
---
Also agility increases sneakiness
---
I am aware of the kickballs and basketballs, I was just wondering if you know of any other locations? I burn through rubber quick. Thanks for your help regardless :)
---
I went the route of giving my vending machines full crafting right there. I have seen other players use them quite frequently. Well except brewing stations, but I don't sell those materials anyways. And they're right inside the house (which is unlocked), so worst case they can go there.
---
Grafton school gym has a bin in the back corner full of kickballs.  Then there's a closet behind that with basketballs.   
---
 Also you can run through the Tyler County Fairgrounds to grab basketballs from the game booth that has them.  I'd also run through anywhere mole miners are in large quantities since their breather's and filter's have rubber, plus you'd be getting lots of xp, guns, etc while you're doing your killing.
---
The support player uprising is coming, brothers and sisters.
---
I'm leaving a message here so I can add you tomorrow
---
Fire extinguisher has rubber too
---
It's always a good idea to let players have access to as much of your camp as possible.
---
I'll be honest, I came in here negatively predisposed from the title, but these are all fair points. Doing this with randoms simply is not viable because of these issues
---
I use rubber for crafting certain armor in bulk and selling it to the vendors. You use rubber for crafting guns, crafting certain things in your camp, making armor, etc.
---
Thank you so much, I'll probably most likely be on tomorrow. What's your PSN?
---
/u/UnlikedMurderer
---
Well this is my fourth lead deposit I've camped on. I used two near Garrahan mining Hq, then one behind Fort Defiance, and now just south of Robco. I like my current location though, since it's nice and flat and I can build how I want.
---
I don't like it because I'm between two fissures, so I get frequent SB spawns. Good with the bad, I guess.
---
I’ll check it out. Thank you
---
We are doing the same! Definitely need to join up together.
---
True but hopefully things go well for you over time.
---
As a melee tank, when she turns away from you.
---
"That's one big twinkie."
---
Before they fixed griefing, I had my camp locked tight. But now I don't care at all. Come in, have a seat, pop a brew. Whatever. I do keep my lead deposit locked, though, since that's the *raison d'etre* for me having my camp where it is.
---
And then come back out of the closet?
---
who the fuck is buying fusion cores
---
Thanks for sharing your characters! I like them and feel like they all fit into the Fallout universe perfectly. The character I'm playing right now is similar to your survival character. He's a loner/prepper type who knows his way around the woods. Devastated by the loss of his family, he tends to drink too much. He also engages in risky behaviors (like seeking out tough monsters to fight) in the vague hope that he's put out of his misery. Somehow, he always seems to get through it okay. Even though he has that dark side, he still tries to help out anyone he comes across. Although he grumbles about the Vault 76 dwellers wandering around Appalachia, he still genuinely believes in humanity. Somewhere deep down, I suspect he wishes he could take part in the rebuilding of the US, but he keeps that desire in check with his bad habits. All that being said, he can enjoy the savage beauty of the wasteland. He also has a sweet spot for cats.
---
It's full of cliches, but I find it a fun way to play the game.
---
I’ll get to it then. Thank you
---
I would gladly spend atom points for a respec token....just saying
---
The munition factory but ppl will kill you quick for it...
---
I crash everytime I try to do it.
---
God no. Please no more microtransactions for a broken game.
---
no point in adjusting the leaderboards for a game mode that isn't competitive because you can use your maxed adventure account to skate through every interaction with ease
---
It makes perfect sense and I can laugh at griefers now.
---
the event is best done with a team of chums, ones who can agree to do the objectives. a lot of randoms are there for the legendary Alpha from what i have seen.
---
-12 % with class freak 3.. wouldnt really call that ”useless”
---
Spectactcular!
---
World full
---
Thanks for all of the replies! I think I’ll combine all of these tips. See how it pans out.
---
I guess. By myself. I got a tier 2 while the other 5 barely got a tier 1 together. I cant get any of the plans for the life of me.
---
You are entirely missing the point. Go make your own post hijacker lol you're mad that accounts transfer over, I get it. Go make a post about that then.
---
I would be happy for weapon weight to just be realistic and consistent, whatever that outcome is.
---
Same too with damage output. How a rocket launcher can be outclassed by someone wielding a knife for example is beyond me, no matter how skills the player is or modded the weapon is.
---
Stuff ended up happening unexpectedly and I had to head out. I probably won't be able to be on tonight, I am really sorry for wasting your time. Is there any way you might be on tomorrow or over the weekend?
---
Ah so it's you who prevents my camp from spawning. War it shall be
---
I had my C.A.M.P built there before, but when I tried to place floor decor in the cave, there's a high chance it will be stuck in the ceiling/road.
---
I tested this and it does in fact work.
---
"Are you the keymaster?"
---
As i said it depend on build, what you suggesting is using 3 perk points to reduce negative effect that's still there and still no positive, much easier solution is to not take this mutation save 3 perk points and have stronger chems
---
I've been using respec a lot lately to min/max my build. And I'm about to retool it from a high-strength PA heavy gun to a non-PA build. It just sucks that you have to wait at least two levels to get a card since it costs a point to move a special.
---
Yeah I meant that I placed them on the rocks. And unfortunately I can't replace my camp because I really like how it turned out
---
That's amazing! So cool.
---
Grafton High's the best I found by far, but there's also a lot of basketballs scattered around near the dross toss in Camden, plus mini ones in Tyler Country fairground, and some stacks of life preservers in Ohio River Adventures and Bolton Greens.
---
Every player over lvl 100: "Why should we, we farm legendaries"
---
Omg.
---
Not a bad build its pretty good!
---
Went in finally after crashing all day yesterday, 4 people were running around the middle lobby area, not one was filling a feeder, so I left. Encrypted all over again lol
---
What's the fixer?
---
Poor design implementation.
---
Still haven't even seen it spawn...
---
Once I get done with my daily "errands" and i'm more casually getting junk to scrap I like to just walk everywhere. Had 3 fog crawlers unexpectedly jumped me as I ran along the road. Good fun.
---
Sounds awesome to me! I’m gonna follow that course right now.
---
Yeah this game should be considered a beta, but is sold as a finished release.  The beta they had was really early access The game is fantastic (except the bugs) and would be incredible if they got the servers up to snuff. I just don't get if BSG is going cheap on servers or the engine is just not built to do the scale BSG wants.
---
No worries. I should be on tomorrow night, not sure about the weekend
---
In my case, mostly for unlocking the buttressed marine armor mod. You can also turn rubber into caps with the marine tactical helmet.
---
All I’ve ever seen is groups of 100+ level players at scorchbeast queen cussing out level 30’s for increasing the health pool of the boss. Sounds like this fix would make it worse.
---
The locomotives dont pull, they push
---
Thanks so much, I would have crafted one but I sold all my rubber :-/
---
she is kinda mean tho
---
i would like someone more wholesome
---
i would love for it to be grahm but he's already busy trading.
---
Yes, it's ridiculous that alien related challenges are in the game. No, the Flatwoods Monster does not count as an alien. The creature must have the "AlienRace" tag. No creatures that can currently spawn have this tag. (We've been over this...a lot...)
---
Oh damn dude haha bad timing. You should be good to go though man. I have no idea why it's a 100% learn but hey whatever works.
---
Because of the way it's designed, I have to agree, though I would've preferred it to be instanced, which would eliminate the point of the notification.
---
Or can be structured like 
---
"1st Place: XxX, Last seen near: Whatever location their last kill was"
---
This one is hard. Even with a friend (and some randoms) it isn’t easy to do everything properly, especially on your first or second run through. Toxic sludge (and other materials) doesn’t seem to repopulate quickly enough to fill the trough enough, especially with enemies knocking you out while you’re collecting crap. 
---
It’s also not easy for me to navigate the space quickly, and instructions aren’t clear enough until you’ve done it a few times. It’s kinda like sheepsquatch- there are instructions, but when you’re in a chaotic tornado of gutsys etc, your reading comprehension goes to practically zero
---
I feel like every legendary that dies within a certain range of you should be lootable, regardless of whether or not you've done damage, as long as it's within 10 levels of you.
---
This would both solve the problem of people one-shotting legendaries(or otherwise denying other players the loot), as well as prevent low levels from farming high level loot by hanging around high level players.
---
Ha ha le snarky comeback.
---
I'd suggest just playing the game instead of crying about non issues
---
And then we'll be wasting time and caps going to shop for wares that effectively aren't really for sale.
---
We'd need some kind of Fallout Yelp system to know which vendors are worth while.
---
I’m switching from automatic rifleman to heavy
---
Gunner the perks just make it so much easier to use
---
Erm.  It's been pretty clearly explained many times why Fallout has a 50s theme.  And also the significance of 76.
---
Only a non issue if you are not smart enough to earn caps.
---
I \*believe\* it's tied to Nuclear Winter, has something to do with pvp and becoming an overseer, getting different levels, according to datamining
---
Agreed. Super immersive.
---
Umm .... They explain in the game why it's called 76 and the 1950's style has just always been the artistic direction of the series
---
People get so psyched when I build them a fusion generator
---
I would beg to reason that at the time the US was using the 556 which is interchangeable with the 762. Our location would then suggest that we are finding old 556 ammo, and know how to make 556 ammo.
---
I haven't sold a single fusion core so I determine that is a lie. I'm pretty sure I sell them at 30 a pop. And not a single one sold.
---
Bad spawns maybe? We had sector A break and do nonstop mobs 12+ stags, 8+ honey beasts it was a madhouse, Sector B is the easiest we found cause the mole rats also have 1-2 sludge as well as the piles so one guy did barrels the other focused mole rats, it seemed C had the slowest of them all with no way to get additional like the other 2
---
Int increases exp gained, luck legendary spawn rate.
---
Is this a fucking JoJo reference?
---
You'll have to use the rug glitch to get them to stick down, had to do it with almost anything in this build
---
I’m trying to figure out if your name is suppose to sarcastic? If you are unable to help yourself and lacking on the second half.
---
Perception also increases detection range (how that works, no idea), Endurance increases health (5hp per point I believe), charisma doesn’t really have a point beyond 15 but how many star cards you can share in a group is charisma dependent (x3 card value, so 3star card requires  9 charisma to share). Intelligence increases XP gains. Agility increases sneak rating. Luck increases VATS crit gain rate.
---
No point, got it
---
The one time I tried to do it I did it with a friend and a bunch of level 20 and below that wouldn't fill the troughs. Needless to say we failed, miserably.
---
Its a ar  with faster sneak speed
---
Gotta be the engine, I'm pretty sure they've used the same one for most/all games, and it's not like 3, New Vegas, or 4 didn't freeze and crash. Whatever they use, it's not like ps or Xbox has varying hardware like pc (then issues might between hardware and their coding), shouldn't be to hard to create something that doesn't crash or boot you all the time. Somehow most every other game maker can do this exponentially better. 
---
I mean, more people per lobby in gta v servers, 100 players per fortnite server, etc.  It's not like they're testing the limits of what is possible.
---
Could be worth a shot lol
---
If you're on xbox1, add me and I'll be happy to help out! I can throw you some gear and back you up in tough spots. GT is TighteyWhiteyMan
---
I love this!!
---
No way, that’s awesome. Kudos on creating such an incredible mix of C.A.M.P and cave, then!
---
&gt; I also need help on the silo run
---
I'm level 116, and neven have the time to commit to do a silo run...
---
Picked up a 3* piece of wood today, and I didn't have any more script room to cash it in.
---
Seems like this should've been a very quick and easy fix.
---
Its a pretty odd event I will add. The only way you can tell its active from looking at the in game map is if someone is already doing it. But usually you'll have to head over to arktos pharma itself at which the event will pop up or it won't depending if its active or not. 
---
So if you go to arktos pharma and you get no notication for the event then its not active and you should keep server hopping.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Yeah, um, you could always play from desktop... you know, by making a shortcut to the game executable. Like games have worked for decades.
---
Do a google search for "Raygun Gothic".
---
To be fair, the broadsider should weigh like 200 lbs and cannonballs really should be somehting like 5 - 10 lbs.  I'm sure this is a 'balancing' thing with BSG.  Handmades are pretty powerful so BSG figures they'll gimp it by making it a quarter ton with mods.
---
What?
---
Sounds like they removed the wrong weapon type tag. Does gladiator still affect the meat hook?
---
The other day I met a guy named BeefChef, name gave me a great laugh. A few steps away I killed a legendary and got a 3* ski sword and found him and gave it to him. The legend of Beefchef and his ski sword grows
---
The kelp doesn’t respawn fast enough either
---
I assume you don't see the irony in the fact you can't keep inventory straight yet try to insult the intelligence of others is lost eh?
---
You can glitch into houses by using a workbench or chair through a window.
---
I'm sorry for your loss
---
I know, but I just discovered you can jump and crouch through windows as well, as long as they aren't the divided windows on brick walls
---
Well take out the chassis and check it. 
---
You can store a complete set of PA, all the armor pieces and chassis and it will just say chassis and only weight 10lbs. 
---
It's a good thing. I have 5 sets and it weighs less then a single set off the chassis. 
---
Make sure to rename it so you know. In inventory, inspect it and then you'll have an option to rename.
---
Oh look this question again
---
You, sir, have saved me a massive headache, as I have no fallout76custom.ini and was not sure what went in there to make texture mods cooperate. Last time I messed with anything that was an ini, it made FO4 game run like it was on speed and high on marijuana at the same time. So yeah, not fucking with those again unless it's to change the invalidation issue
---
Pretty sure the "76" is carried on from 1776, the year the Declaration if Independence was signed....
---
Get on your mic and tell people off until they start doing it right.
---
Just play it and form your own opinion. Coming into a thread and asking people whom regularly play the game if you should is obviously not going to change how you would feel about the fsne until you have your own experience
---
Shhhhhhhhh ...... don't tell anyone.   All those level 3 locked doors that are so tempting to want to know what the player is locking away.
---
I've been just marching right in those windows to have a look for weeks.  Usually, there is absolutely no reason that the door is locked ..... nothing to hide .... certainly nothing to steal, even if you could steal stuff.
---
„when i just tried to place it the pieces were missing“ 
---
i did take it out. the pieces are GONE
---
I’m glad people are able to enjoy themselves here instead of always having to run to our little speakeasy over there.
---
That being said, it’s a good place to camp out whenever a new update drops and jimmies get rustled all over again.
---
I have my vending machines full. And a full stock of replacement inventory. Perhaps your concept of my original post is lost. Maybe you wouldn’t be so depressed if you spent less time online seeking approval from people you don’t know and more time changing your life for the better. Get off your ass and stop waiting for other people to fix your problems. A therapist is simply another way to push off your problems instead of dealing with them.
---
no.  The 7.62 an ak uses is 7.62x39.  The type that the US and NATO use is 7.62x51 and is a very different round.
---
Yeah, I wasn't really speaking about this reddit but in general I think most posts seem to be very civilized compared to most gaming subs.
---
5.56 is not interchangeable with 7.62 at all. 7.62 is a much larger bullet comparable to .308.
---
I think if you do the event at lvl 50 with an alt you'll get one.
---
I'll check in the morning.
---
That weapon when used is very much in the vein of a DC and Mole Miner gauntlet. If they made it a 1H weapon that's just stupid.
---
I have bigger problem no one care about filling feeders and then we have one death claw and two blood bugs ;/
---
I was under the impression that they were same sized shell with less gunpowder in the 556. Equivalent to the .38 and the .357
---
Unfortunately this is how it goes. When it comes to exploits like this, stopping the exploiter takes precedence over making the experience enjoyable for the proper players.
---
Damn who opened the salt mine. Lmao
---
yes, but that involves playing until level 50 all over again, and i'm not quite that hardcore of a player.
---
It does. Thanks man!
---
Oh I agree, that’s why I said they removed the wrong one.
---
That wasn’t directed at you. It was addressed to Bethesda 👈😏
---
What are you smoking... literally go to google images and type 5.56 vs 7.62x39 and you’ll see the difference.
---
Well since you all regularly play the game you should know if the bugs have been fixed or not lol. It’s a simple question.
---
I’m not asking if the game is good or not, but if it’s still filled with bugs and glitches like people used to say months ago.
---
Or you could trade... sorry, it's the only 2 ways I know.
---
Trolls like that are too bored to keep playing, he's desperate for someone to engage him so he's acting out to bait some attention to give himself a reason to keep playing.  Ignore and let him quit, we don't want him.
---
Put the gun down mr hostile I don’t actually care
---
That's bascially what "challenging" means, thus the point. Challenging =/= fun. Launching a nuke is just as big a waste of time as snapping a picture of something. You're still not ACTUALLY achieving anything.
---
Would anyone want to trade a garb of mysteries
---
I can't even take more than 50 pictures on consoles for no reason, so i end up deleting almost all of my pictures except for the old ones
---
or, uh, don't have a power switch powering them.
---
all powering them actually does it make them appear on the map. they can still be used when not powered.
---
just fyi, in case someone didn't know.
---
I’m being direct with you. I read the post on your profile. For real though. I was in the same place were. The only way out is by forcing yourself to a place that is uncomfortable. But you will prosper from it I promise. You might unlock some potential that you didn’t know existed before. Only you can change your life. Nobody else.
---
Agree to disagree then, because this is the exact kind of overreacting I was talking about. FOV sliders that don't exist on most console games don't make it unplayable, and having g bugs should have been expected. They could have delayed launch 2 years and there would still be bugs, so why not release and fix them as they come up like they said they were going to?
---
Yes. New patches and bug fixes come out over time lol. I wanna know if the game is buggy as of today.
---
Excellent. Have fun!
---
False, there is a rating buff for the stealth rating per piece. Doesn’t  matter in PVP but the rating is calculated in how enemies detect you in PVE
---
...i know.
---
hence this topic being made.
---
You should care about being taught something if you make false claims.
---
Ill add to this.... Ive closed off my machines behind a locked door, when i got to max caps. Dont forget, people you team up with can open your locked doors and buy stuff from your machines....even if they dont have power to them. Which results in you losing caps. Just an fyi
---
I thought i once did not play music and failed the event and no mobs were comming,wil try again
---
Player vending and legendary vendor had helped me with "The Bulge", but now I'm at max caps and my stash never seems to get below 700 ever.
---
Vending really is great, but I wish people had more good stuff for sale. All these caps are burning a hole in my pocket.
---
I did buy my first Bloody Explosive weapon though! Lvl 40 single action revolver for o ly 2k caps. I guess cause it's only lvl 40.
---
Now if I could only find a bloody swing speed unarmed weapon.
---
If only:)
---
I never said it was greedy? It's smart. Wouldn't you take advantage of millions of idiots if you could? The problem is, I don't want to pay for it. Give me a complete game. Like the good ol days.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I've failed it every time and have no idea what to do.  I think it's because I get there late and it's not very explanatory.  You just arrive and attack red enemies, maybe protect not-red ones, and fail quickly at whatever.  I feel like they need a notification earlier so more people show up to help sooner.
---
It's just like the Byrrows when it first came out everything was very chaotic and then when everybody got their fill of running around like a nut things calmed down  people were finally able to complete the mission.
---
It’s not important enough to know. Regardless of that, it’s been learned now. 
---
But that doesn’t make it worth a damn
---
Yeah- I’ve done a few rounds in various rooms and none of the stuff seems to spawn fast enough (maybe if there were multiple people in each room?). I’m still trying to figure out if it’s better to concentrate effort on getting one room to 3/3 or split up and get 3 rooms partly there
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch
---
That's wierd cause crouching rarely let's me get through tight areas that look like I should be able to.
---
I'm on the western side of the map and get low traffic beacause I have 25 guns (all max level god rolls I traded for or found)  and I assume people think I'm low level. I put 100 stims as a signal I'm high level and buisness is booming
---
Because you suggested sending someone you don't know a bunch of weapons? How is that non-threatening? You know who thinks it's non-threatening? People who grandstand about violence and protest it to shoddily protect their own dark secrets. 
---
Also, don't give a shit about your life history. Thanks for sharing.
---
“Take advantage of millions of idiots” you’re definitely the dumb one of your friends pal lmao
---
Just saying there's other ways to get it right now. I doubt Beth will add this ability. They might.. but If they did it'd be awhile. You sound like you want one right now.
---
I was just surprised to see the level 5 walk out of my bedroom when all my doors are locked, I have never seen people do that before even in survival lmao. Always seeing something new in this game
---
Huh?
---
Ive stopped trying to say this because it just gets you downvotes, but 800 pounds is MORE than enough. So many of us Fallout players just have that hoarder mentality still.
---
... Right. Make a false claim, get proven otherwise, and act like the other person’s wrong for correction you. Too much pride.
---
Duuuude I have to agree. I remember when I could pacify scorched beasts to avoid a fight because I wanted to save ammo or running low on health or it was destroying my camp or just f’in annoying. I could go on and on about how convenient it was to have this perk and how useless it now feels after it got nerfed for some f’ed reason. I could be wrong, but I don’t get the option to pacify them anymore with both animal friend and whisper maxed and a ton of charisma.
---
LOL. Yup. Vampire weapons are awesome.  I have a Vampiric Gatling.  Just get into a corner or sheltered cubby so they can only attack you from the front and just work left to right until nothing is left.  Only monsters with damage that can outpace the health regen of the vampire weapon would be a concern.
---
Which only means that they're breaking things all the time...
---
This is one of the reasons that has stopped me from doing this event so far.
---
I have no means to know how far into the event people are when I notice that is active.
---
I really don't want to be 'that guy', you know, the guy that turns up at the stage where you are defending and things are looking OK and suddenly here comes Tradey76 waving cheerfully along with a cohort of Gutsies, Assaultrons and Sentries and everything turns to crap for everyone, himself included.
---
Please add a server-wide alert like you did with the ISS and once Stage 1 is complete lock that effing elevator.
---
Did they work before? There’s two version of RR legendary. One works, the other is a mislabeled and bugged out disease resist legendary effect. Internally it’s supposed to be disease resist, the label text we see says rad resist, but it’s broken either way, has no effect. 
---
If your normal, proper, functional RR pieces somehow changed to the broken version... that’s fucked. I haven’t seen that happen before, but man, with some of the other bugs (vanishing effects on rewards from the legendary vendor for one...) I wouldn’t be toooooo surprised.
---
Because seperate stash limit is a bad idea.
---
I was protecting one of the animals today during the Pharmacy event. I thought I tagged the alpha, but I tagged him before he regenerated or something. Didn’t get anything off him. Rubbish, especially since one of the main objectives is “protect the damn thing” and mobs keep spawning at him.
---
Yawn
---
My solution to a common Camp building problem.
---
Step one, fuck up placing stairs
---
Step two, find a nice wicker chair capable of sustaining your body weight.
---
Step three, take Hemp Cord, make a loop, bend it back on itself and wrap 13 times.
---
Step four, hang myself.
---
*Step five, realize I'm kidding about killing yourself and you should try to maintain good mental health*
---
Anywhere clothing spawns?
---
On second thought. Take the alternative route. The world will be a better place
---
First, buy treated and resistant lining plans in Watoga. Then keep on doing the event Census Violence and you'll eventually earn Protective, and then Shielded lining plan as rewards. It took me over doing 50 events to get the Shielded one.
---
This....every g- d- day!it costs like 20 dollar now...(game is awesome tho :)
---
Don’t project on me man lol
---
Take a Picture in The Forest: 40 Atoms
---
Take a Picture of Someone in a Space Suit Fighting an Alien: 10 Atoms
---
Take a Picture of yourself giving a Scorchbeast Queen a rectal examination with a Lead Pipe you crafted yourself while naked in a triple nuked zone during a rad storm on a Wednesday afternoon... Priceless
---
I usually goes as far as putting signs pointing at fusion core generators when I take them. They top out at 3 and I only have so much time to come and empty it out, someone might as well enjoy them.
---
Yeah it’s also just a video game and it looking like an AK doesn’t actually mean jack
---
Double ha
---
Just do a loop of the buildings around Whitesprings you'll find a couple
---
I feel like this is just another negative post about how you think this event should be ran. Not to be rude but it’s made this way by design and it’s not that bad. A few of your grips were intended. Like the “bullet sponge” end boss. Why the hell would they make it easy. People are upset about it being to easy and too hard. This game is about adapting. PERIOD. Adapt instead of making a post to get them to change it. The more people whine the more we get broken crap like game turned into with the last update. Because of whining you can’t destroy bases and people say “got to the pvp server.” Well those are broken too. The point is adapt instead of trying to get them to “fix” what you don’t like. Happy posting
---
I haven't seen any players selling them since it got patched to not drop from the SBQ anymore
---
I have the first ones but it's the last two! I've been at it for several days now and I'm starting to detest the whole server hopping for nothing to happen.
---
Did bethesda broke the game with project paradise event, my freind wanted to show me few weapons she got by dropping and she lost all her armor weapons even her power armor from leaving it wtf??...someone else got that glitch?
---
Yep same thing happened to me. I decided I'll just cut the wire if I play survival
---
The leaderboard is fine. The being marked on the map is HORRIBLE.
---
that's not counting the light glitches the sliding ghouls the invisible ennemies killing you and the lagfrom it
---
Goodluck!
---
Gun strength should be balanced by ammo weight not gun weight. Make me actually think about what ammo i have on me and how much weight i can dedicate to it instead of it meaning nothing.
---
Yeah he didn’t say you were wrong. He actually accepted he was wrong and then you whipped out your e-peen and tried to sword fight him.
---
If the value slider wasn’t such a pain in the ass I might. I usually just accept whatever price it suggests.
---
Never knew at one point you could pacify it
---
Glad to see some people enjoy it, but I'm not a fan of higher level = you lose more caps when you die. 
---
Suppose some people have more caps than they know what to do with and don't mind throwing money away I guess. :)
---
Love to a different and avoid that random even if that's the issue. It has little to do with your gear
---
Yeah don’t they know fallout is a military simulator? /s they’ll get to it
---
The event awards a whitewolf fedora most of the time.
---
Yeah figured I'd try renaming it too but didn't get a chance...
---
They took my Twisted muscles recipe off me too a few weeks ago... Just disappeared from my list... Best 19000 caps ever spent...
---
Told me there is nothing they can do...
---
Its the 150 Osmium Screws you used to put it together.
---
This is going to be a big help next time I load inside a camp that’s still loading
---
It's analogous to .308 which would be more appropriate (and stronger).
---
Right?
---
Just Fallout. Best bits of the series. :)
---
Maybe stimpaks is the way to go
---
Then don't faceroll? Like, I'm pretty sure those turrets have very long recharge window when they're not hitting you.
---
ak uses 7.62mm  x 39mm /.308 caliber is same as 7.62mm x 51mm.  / ar uses 5.56mm which is same as .223 caliber
---
Idk sounds kinda pay-to-win should I call yongyea?
---
As long as you hit the desired enemy, like the queen or imposter, then you do get to loot the enemy. This works for all enemies, and I doubt it's possible for anyone to 1 shot the queen or the imposter or the real SS so get your hit in before you decide to aid your comrades.
---
At the same time, seems like something that would be trivial to coordinate with a friend, assuming you can find an alien.
---
There's a building in watoga that mist have these. Insanely accurate and deadly AF.
---
No, he disputed, and when proven wrong, he went with the “I don’t care go away” routine. That’s not accepting being wrong, that’s being dismissive and trying to paint me in a negative light to draw attention away from the subject. I’m not sure which part of denouncing that behavior counts as whipping out a e-peen, but alright.
---
Were you not aware they made cpa loss 1/4 of your level?
---
I paid $20 for it when I bought my ps4 last week lol
---
Yeah but... Isn’t it nice to being a God and actually fearing an “enemy”? 
---
I actually started walking around with non legendary armor because I was bored of being indestructible..
---
This is what I mean lol
---
watchmen!!!
---
Lmao when you get so salty you tell someone to kill themselves.
---
Because of those issues when solo i just focus on getting 3 star legendary to spawn. Hopefully during weekend i will somehow gather a team to go for rewards.
---
You can approach them with out entering their line of sight. From above or around a object or if your really lucky sneak up to.
---
But I do agree not all turrets deal the same amount of damage
---
Was not aware, thanks for letting me know!
---
Careful most people don't want to hear the truth.
---
I reference you to AK-101 and AKU-74
---
AK-101: 5.56 NATO
---
AKU-74: 5.56x39mm
---
I didn’t say that. Maybe thats your conscience telling you that everyday.
---
I have a farming method that allows me to craft a few hundred stims in under 30mins. I sell diluteds for 4c standards for 8c and supers for 15c. I keep 10 standards for 1c each for low levels tho. Ive made a few thousand off Stimpacks alone.
---
5.56 is a .22 caliber "intermediate" round and 7.62 is a .31 caliber large rifle round.  Pic for emphasis - https://www.pewpewtactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image1.png
---
No he said he didn’t care because he wanted you to stop waving your dick at him... I bet you think your knowledge of firearms makes so fun to talk to lol. He probably genuinely does not care about guns very much and when told he was wrong he didn’t even dispute it he just said oh alright
---
And you look like you rushed to comment about how negative I'm being without taking half a second to actually comprehend what I wrote.
---
Where did I say the boss should be easy?  There's more ways of making a fight hard than just making everything a fucking sponge for damage that eats up ammo and that's it.  Like I said, it's a drug lab and we already have syringers and grenades in the game.  They could have added actual MECHANICS to the fight where we have to collect ingredients or ammo or anything like that to weaken it's attack/defense/speed instead of just mindlessly blasting another giant enemy wi th a lot of health in the face.
---
This guy is a tool don’t worry
---
This right here.
---
Awesome tyvm cheers wastelander 😊
---
Int also increases salvage quantity up to 70% ish.
---
One try one goal. With no crash
---
Yup, they worked before. On both characters
---
Hopefully it's something they'll implement in the future. Save me some wear and tear on my controller
---
I bet your using the large brick windows?
---
How much for it?
---
BEWARE OF SHEEPSQUATCH!!!
---
The way you cry about being depressed? I’m sooo sad... waahhh.... someone feel sorry for me...
---
All I mostly due is craft so I can relate
---
Speysage
---
What platform?  If PS4 send me their PSN and I will investigate personally.
---
Yup. Had to switch to the ones with the divide in the middle to stop it
---
I love this idea!!
---
Also if I could keep my shop in game open from my phone and do minimal inventory management with what I have availiable in my camp that would be awesome.
---
It’s as if they intended it to be done in a group 🤔
---
He straight roasted me....
---
Right I don't see why people wast resources to lock doors
---
I enjoy the game immensely.
---
I'm Level 55 and its a struggle bus.
---
The fusion reactors in cars are radioactive, that's not how fusion works either.  Fallout lore isn't based on our science.
---
Sorry. On PC... Too bad too.  I got a decent \*\*\* pipe rifle this past weekend but scrapped it in disgust.  If we were on the same platform I'd save one for you (I expect MANY \*\*\* pipe weapons in my future).  I did get an interesting \*\*\* Instigating Crossbow with +50 critical damage and +15% vats refill. Sounds like my stealth/sniper alt will have a toy to play with at lvl 45.
---
And that's what i want to do unfortunately my real life friends are not playing anymore, there is no in game group search option and discord is almost empty when i have time to play what makes it quite difficult, as well you can't have long friend list on game because it's causing terrible lag.
---
If you can borrow me some of your friends that will be great (I'm on PC)
---
I think I have a FE pipe rifle in my vending machine (might have sold today IDK) I also have another Furious Pipe rifle I can sell you
---
I have a few on psn, I'll be on later tonight if you want a freebie

While we're the subject when you do the belly of the beast mission. DO NOT THROW AWAY THE CHASSIS IT REWARDS YOU.

It's a full set of ultracite PA. I did that and it took 2 weeks for me to gather the resources to craft another. Appaerntly there are better places to mine ultracite but it still sucks I destroyed it.
---
Depends. Was it PC?
---
I still use the first fusion generator i ever had, 180 levels later. Ive never crushed it, only stored and placed. A level 140 helped me a Ton when i was in my 20s-30s. He doesn't play anymore but that generator still hums away.
---
So best = the first, basically?
---
But you don’t have to... you could still use the level up choice to move the special stats...

Fyi, I’m triple figures, easily, for doing census violence. Have neither prot or shielded

I gave the fuck up and used the BoS under armor....

What micro transaction? You didn’t reply to anything in particular here

Lmao

I assume you just forgot to put “TLDR” at the start there, hmm?

Not such a bad idea: compromise with showing #1 player's last kill location...
---
I've had no luck... did you end up finding it?
---
Right, just because I can differentiate between two of the most used calibers of weapons in the world, it must mean I’m a gun nut who will preach about guns to anyone I meet.
---
Yea so everyone can have tse weapons, for even less effort! Great idea
---
:D
---
A Rad-X cartridge would be amazing for pvp...
---
*logs onto fallout 4, joins server (personal save file)*
---
Lol you're such a dipshit.
---
That does seem pretty brutal. You would think it would be like diabo. Where you get 1 free respec (which you can save) and then further ones cost some high end currency. That would be cool even if its atoms it gives a new reason to grind out dailys
---
When the queen tposes, Im always reminded of those budget halloween scares with a giant bat on a rope that swings across an area, so I usually just end up calling her "spooky bitch"
---
Well you got awful worked up about it. The guy literally caved and instantly went along with what you were saying yet still out came the peen. It was just unnecessarily rude. “Point blank”.
---
I’m a lvl 105 2 handed melee build. I’ve ran out of things to do so I’ve just been rolling for sick ranged weapons just to try them out. I just want them for fun because swinging a melee repeatedly is boring. Hoping to get a really good cryolater and a gamma gun next.
---
That’s why it’s usually coated in plastic or, ya know, cloth fiber when worn
---
Basically you get better rewards and a higher success rate when in a group, but its possible. Kinda.
---
Nothing untrue about it lol
---
As someone said yes and no because you will be able to keep alive only one animal what meant lowest your reward.
---
What’s the difficulty of Free Range compared to Encrypted?
---
How about dropping $20 and buying it?

Says the guy who has a whole post hating against police. But we all know you are the first bitch you would call them for help when in trouble. ‘Protect me from myself officer. I’m too weak to handle my own problems. I tried to post about my problems but that didn’t fix it... waaahh’
---
Great post, very well thought out! I agree with all of your points and have personally experienced the frustration related to many of them. Honestly, 5a is and will continue to be my frustration with all these new “end game” events until they develop ACTUAL mechanics. I don’t care that this boss is level 100 instead of level 80 when literally all it means is that I have to wail on it a few more times with my melee weapon. The lack of mechanics is so anticlimactic and just feels kinda sad.
---
They don't actually hurt much as long as you have decent explosion resistance (dense or padded torso mod + fireproof perk). The stagger is annoying but you get there in the end.
---
Harper's is easy to clear anyway. Just start from the church side and you can jump the turrets without taking hits.
---
It's pretty condensed pretty much like all the 3D fallouts have been.
---
The new event does.
---
Aliens!!!
---
How bout not responding to my post if you’re not gonna answer the question? 🤣
---
&gt;I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. Pardon? ;P
---
Take a pic
---
Clear out west tek super mutants. Take all the weapons and scrap them it gives loads of rubber/plastic/steel plus a few legendary here and there
---
That sucks, man. I wonder if they were trying to fix the broken effect and instead broke the working one... apparently something similar may have happened with the meat hook (it used to double dip and get both 1h and unarmed perks. Someone’s reporting the unarmed perks don’t work for it anymore... unknown yet if the 1h perks do. It should be unarmed.)
---
The only other mmo I've ever played is Star Trek Online, and respec tokens are available for zen, which is in game premium currency. You can grind it out, or buy them. But it's a full respec. That's how it should be. Make me pay for it, idc. Now it takes ages to retool a build.
---
If you're on PC I can sell you one.
---
I answered it. Buy the game and find out.

I didn’t communicate it well, I thought he meant each word after another word got consecutively smaller than the one before.
---
The crafted diffusers.  I dunno, I've sold quite a few of them.  Might drop the price a bit, maybe not.
---
The point of my question is for people who play the game to let me know if the game still has game breaking bugs or glitches.
---
If it doesn’t, I will buy it. If it does, I won’t. Seems pretty clear lol.
---
Use the lead to protect you wood?

No, they still drop.

I made an extra copy. Now I just have to find someone to pay it forward to.

i‘ll keep that memorized, thanks!

hard work gone especially considering it‘s the 2nd time i‘m crafting it because i had to server hop the first time. jesus, i lost count how many times i had to clear out that place. 
---
and blackwater mine for black titanium. ugh im so defeated 
---
i just need a t45 torso and then at least i still have a full suit left

Actually when they do this it turns off their machines aswell.. it out did last week lol
---
Weird, I can place my cat
---
What do you want for that xbow?
---
Chill, what so hes gonna open a box and a weapon gonna jump out a box and shoot him? Get real.. tryin to create drama and issues where there are none.. i will explain this again since evidently you cant understand why i said someone needs to send him a box of weapons..

So he can weigh them and understand how much different types of rifles weigh ya tool.

Are they fumigating underneath your bridge or something?

I think it’s r/FO76settlements

I had so many problems tonight it's just crazy. They seriously  need to tighten shit up before Nuclear Winter. I stopped keeping track of the bugs after my mutations stopped working and I was at 3 strength for some reason (no debuffs) and couldn't travel to my buddy who was in need of help... I just got angry. Because I'd already been dealiing with a bunch of other stuff and that just sealed the deal for me.
---
*Whoosh*
---
My town isn't even in the game.  I did put my first camp roughly where my town should've been if it were in the game, but it's not the same.

Even some of the places in the game are in the wrong part of the state.  They took A LOT of artistic liberties.

Ignore that it’s r/fallout76settlements

And btw you opened the door to the life history by your statement.. if ya didnt want a reply you should have scrolled on..

---
No, that was Deadpool. God, people these days not reading the patch notes.
---
You could probably go like 3-4 on water and have some buyers but for more expensive things try to look around at others stuff and see what everyone is selling for how much
---
I tried to find it on dev tracker, but they responded to someone's suggestion of using the terminal to Mark what you want notifications for, so hopefully you'll get your way as well.
---
No game is bug free. Guess you're gonna miss out then.
---
I'm a level 60 or so, but I'm always down for new people to play with. Skellyassassin, EST.
---
I saw a 105 in the new event
---
Sweet.  Thank you!
---
Why does the handmade vastly better than the combat rifle or assault rifle in nearly every possible way? Why are the DCG/Power fist heads above the other unarmed weapons? There’s a lot of balance to be had...
---
Well, I know you can kill both the Vengeful and Stalking versions (they drop different stuff, and the Stalking one isn't always obvious that you killed it apart from stuff being left behind).  Though I may just have been unlucky on the few Stalking ones I failed to kill and the loot was left in a not obvious place etc (had one I know I didn't kill the other day, but nothing was left where it had been unless it was clipped into the ground and unreachable for example, as my wife and I were looting the area from other kills and would have noticed if anything was left to be picked up =).  Though I also know that the two types do have different things they leave (and I think the wing is only dropped by vengeful, but can't be certain about it).
---
Sounds great, please give an insight where I could obtain this weapon? And what perks you run
---
My view:
---
Drop leader tracking
---
Track everyone within X distance of a fast travel point.  Looking for people?  Watch the map then home in on them.... and actually track them down.
---
Let’s the people who want the battle royale FFA around certain places know where the action is, let’s the hunters hunt, and let’s those that just like the extra danger play the game.
---
I think a better solution would be to make the Servers, both Adventure and Survival, level specific.
---
I was as a SBQ event on Adventure with about 6-7 level 250-450 players (at level 205, I was the lowest level player there).    Those other players took down the SBQ in less than 5 minutes.  .... when we all got the event reward, they turned their massive damage explosive weapons on me, and in less than a second (on Adventure mode - even with the damage buffer for not engaging in PvP) I was dead and I lost all the junk that I had gained from participating.
---
I share your frustration, in that these weapons are not available to all ... just those who bought them off of dupers back at the outset of game launch.   Let them play together, and the rest of us have our own servers.
---
Do you have quack surgeon or mysterious savior?  Great additions to a medic build :)
---
I usually sell my items for either in game price or 1/2 in game price. Depends on the item
---
Thanks
---
Shouldn't be there at all
---
I did it, then got taken out in one shot by a cricket and my game crashed, but yeah it’s possible, but it’s a pain
---
If they are energy then they are legacy.
---
Also plasmas right?
---
Certain items are currently bugged. Wood armor will all turn to 1star when you log off; assaultron heads lose their primary when you log off. Never heard of getting a 1star when paying for a 3 though.
---
Good points, I sorta enjoy the enemy respawns though because I like killin' shit. I'm a fully decked out 150 tho so I can understand how it'd be annoying for others to deal with, and it does sorta fuck with the event by cluttering it and making it harder. Maybe tone down respawns while the event is ongoing?
---
No. He wants a healthy discussion on the leaderboards lol..........
---
I do, but you can't transfer it
---
But you can still buy from vendors even if they are at limit so no its not already in the game.
---
According to my game, I have never been to the Toxic Valley at any of the locations on any of the alts (it still lists 0/5 discovered =).  My wife has similar issues (but hers has some listed as discovered, so I have hope she may get it done if she ever bothers to work on her alt any =).
---
I suspect the reason the issue hasn't been fully resolved yet is that it isn't really a single issue but multiple issues with the same result.  Hopefully they get them all sorted eventually (I honestly care less about the atoms and more about just having it show as done at this point =).
---
I discovered by accident wanting to look into a very creative player's locked camp.  I jumped onto their roof, and overshot through their window .... 
---
I said "nice to know" to myself .... hoping no one else would notice.  
---
Too Late.
---
I have never even seen the tourist
---
Yes, but Gauss rifles still drop explosive even though they’re considered energy
---
Yea there is proof of this this is why im sad i wanted a new way to trevers in frozen Wastlands of 76 but no 😞 Bethesda is gona make battle royal a thing and if the servers can barely handle 25 people in the same aria how will people kill other  players if there are like 100 ?
---
Yes
---
Do you have any idea how an array of items work? They have to literally delete 2 lines, then move everything up to fill in those spots. They cannot be bothered with all this work!
---
Agreed, budget capped :/
---
Well damn xD
---
Inb4 you discover Fireproof
---
I think about that quote a lot, probably the best quote to come from gaming as its so true
---
Hahaha
---
That sucks. I figured it would be different, but it sucks your town isn't even there.
---
Every few updates they break one or more of the weight reduction perks.  For a while, instead of missiles, mini-nukes, etc. getting a 60% reduction in wt. from Rank 2 Ordinance Express, they were .6 lbs less!  As in, they coded it to have 60% of ONE POUND reduced from their weight... *sigh*
---
Thats minus 10 atoms right?
---
I thought it was more about lack of NPCs, not lore?
---
I don’t mind that they take longer- I’m still not finished but UGH I wish mothman would appear so I could finish Entomologist!
---
for some reason it didnt work when i shot that 3 starred lvl 100 thing at project paradise
---
Dame i wanted a 2 shot flare gun 😥 lol
---
Morgantown and Charleston are NE and SW corners as far as any points in WV
---
Not to mention that if you put on scrapper and scrap a ton of combat rifles or what have you, you’ll get a ton of steel
---
You on xbox? I'm called near a span point. Tell me your GT and I'll try to let you know next time I find one.
---
yup thats how it is .
---
Which has a character that is a reference to a poem by the same name, yes.
---
Yeah I meant the actual spoilers! That’s fine I can wait just curious as to what it entails
---
So uh, there’s AK platform rifles that use 5.56
---
Jussayin
---
I know that. But this is a game that months ago was called unplayable and received bad reviews for its major bugs.
---
I’m sure it’s a great game (that’s why I’m thinking about buying it), I just wanted to know if those major game breaking bugs have been fixed or I should wait a bit more for them to get fixed.
---
I think they will slowly add in higher levels with updates as they have been
---
Odd... this literally popped into my head about an hour ago... 🤔🤨 Let us know how it goes!
---
+karma
---
I hope it works like I hope it will. People message me about my high tier weapons because if they can save a few hundred caps for a few minutes time why wouldnt they. I just hope people dont message me about a 5 cap discount on 10 stimpacks.
---
Harpers ferry has been a great nuke place for a long time. People are affraid of horde's of super mutant's because they don't wanna die
---
I'm saying it's a useful benchmark to gauge what "weight" means in-game.
---
If a 25 pound weight weighs 25 "Vault-tec Standardised Encumbrance Units" or whatever, then you can safely assume that V.S.E.U.'s equal pounds.  
---
And, yes.  The lifting weights are the only things that have a sensible weight.
---
But your saying that's because "weight" doesn't mean "weight in pounds", and I'm saying it's because Bethesda either doesn't know it doesn't care what things should weigh.
---
Yes, there is a 4th floor where the elevator is with the lasers. You have to register as a brotherhood of steel member in order to use it. It’s right in front of you as soon as you walk out of the elevator. You have to go through some errands in Charleston though
---
Wavy Willards is fun to nuke, plus lots of flux
---
That's the way she goes.
---
Great idea, the reason I posted about it though isn't because I was worried about me I can still clear those areas no problem. I'm worried about the noobies who aren't so great at the game being unable to even get close to those things. The difficulty to reward ratio for fighting those isn't worth it at all and if you kill one theres 2 more with clear sights on you. The area is supposed to be level 35+ not 60+ and the burrows is also located in the same area. Honestly if they wanted to make the burrows more of a challenge they should have added 10-12 of those suckers in there but thats besides the point :P its just a random difficulty spike.
---
I honestly did not know there was a chance for legendary drills.
---
I need one.  I don't even care if it's a terrible combination.  I'd just love to have one that I can run around with in low level areas.
---
I'm guessing they're in the purveyor's pool under melee.  Looks like I'll be farming that and scout armor now.
---
Okay those not having problems like me.  
---
Couple of questions to see if we can determine why you don't have issues.  What area of the country are you in?  What's your carrier and speed?  What's your platform?  I'm curious why everyone I know who's played it had the same issues (we'd be playing and get the same weirdness, disconnects, and server not responding messages at the same time).  I might experiment with my VPN and different areas/cities in the nation - I have a 180 -190 Mbps connection so running through a VPN shouldn't hurt performance too much.  Wondering if certain areas have a better connection to BSG's servers.
---
And a 30 pound mini-gun. with a "90% weight reduction" legendary effect only weighs 3 pounds.  What's your point?
---
I'm about to get on, that shouldn't be an issue, I can join you or you can join me. I'm super overencumbered so if you don't mind jumping to my location, I'd be able to give it to you :)
---
You're alive because you were meant to experience that rush 😉 It's like the gamers high you can't get enough of 🤪
---
Waaaaaaahhh waahhhhhhhhh
---
I have 19 in my stash that will not trigger the quest. It doesn't matter if I drop them or put them in a container. They don't trigger the quest. I have to pick up a new one.
---
They don't exist. You can't get drills from the purveyor, and you can only get regular (non-legendary) drills instead of a legendary item from legendary enemies
---
Are you on PC? I have a knight Sgt paint for sale in my machine.
---
but can you just like google X item price?? sincere question
---
True stuff right there. Maybe should add a "If over 500 caps"?
---
Events events events. And certain quest
---
LOL. You know where they are now. 
---
 My Explosion Resistance is high and I can take a few seconds and sometimes just ignore em' unless I want to go where they fire. 
---
 My X0-1 I have to be careful with. ;)
---
Do u play on ps4? I killed my first flatwoods monster yesterday, I found out my house is in a a flatwoods monster spawn lmao
---
You know what we need? Arcade style pinball machines.
---
That's how spawning works in this game, and you're right: it's not great. 
---
I understand the underlying design philosophy. If you don't respawn enemies when a new player zones in, you could create a situation where some players are always late to the party so to speak and have to fight over every single kill. That would make nuke zones suck really hard, because once the area has been cleaned up there'd be nothing left for players who didn't charge into the mushroom cloud right as the nuke dropped.
---
The problem is that event zones like the Arktos basement follow the same spawning rules as the rest of the world. The current spawning system is fine for 99% of the game, but event zones should probably follow different rules.
---
Basically, Arktos should work like this:
---
* When the event starts, spawn all robots and ghouls.  
---
* Once killed, ghouls do not respawn.  
---
* If the mainframe has been shut down, robots also do not respawn. Otherwise, robots keep respawning.    
---
* All critter spawns happen as usual.  
---
* When the event ends, purge all players from the zone and lock down the basement until the event is ready again.
---
This will probably be solved once there is proper instancing, but until then Arktos is gonna be a little annoying sometimes.
---
I usually leave my water purifier unlocked so anybody can get free water from that traveling around. Plus it's usually restocked by the time I get there. 
---
Most common things you'll find sellable at your level is ammo. 
---
5.56 goes about 1cap ea. Big bulk sales like &gt;3k brings it down to about ~.75. But you can just toss up your rounds in the vendor at 1ea, .45 and shotgun ammo is about the same as 5.56. 
---
If you find you have excess stimpacks throw those on there 10-15caps ea. 
---
A lot of junk people use frequently is:
---
Acid: 2c ea, cloth: 1, screws:3-5, springs:2-4, gears:1-2, lead:2, steel:1, something else like nuclear Waste:2. 
---
Most junk sells for 1-2 caps depending on the rarity. Some other junk like fiberglass and other uncommon stuff sells for 2-3ea.
---
Explosive would be the best as it’s what I use now, what’s your GT?
---
It is a nice feature, say you are too close to max caps, have a hidden switch that seals all doors and turns off the beacon. but only if someone cannot be a major butt about it. i have mine hidden where most cannot reach it
---
Is this the same cave that people have been building in or are there multiple areas like this?
---
Who even charges at turrets in their arcs of fire? Why risk armor degradation?  Have we forgotten the lessons from the battle of Balaclava in 1854?
---
powered doors and keypad doors. no need to worry as much
---
I'm wearing that with the green hood and a traveling leather coat
---
Well now that you got that out of your system lol. You want “mechanics” to make the boss easier. Plain and simple. It wasn’t a rush to judgment it was a rush to “I’m sick of the negative whining and picking the game apart because you can do better” mentality that people have. Maybe it isn’t as easy as you might think to implement a weapon like that. If you aren’t a programmer then honestly it’s just babble of thinking you know better. Like I said I do agree with some points but the majority is how “you” think it should be changed. Nothing wrong with sharing your opinion but I’d like to see more positivity from people.

I really like the idea of a cap stash - if only of the idea that it would increase our cap limit, or in this case the possibility of having more than the cap limit stashed around our camps... I'd totally make a fun house.

I think we were able to get a legacy drill at one time... but it may have been in beta.. not sure
---
 A measly 1 star, Nocturnal Pickaxe.  So you're officially back as a FO76 player! Welcome to the land of crap legendaries from \*\*\* enemies.  For more fun, try the new legendary vendor - grind an hour get crap \* legendaries turn them in for legendary scrip and get a \*\*\* crap legendary!  Fun.
---
Sunny top was AWFUL. Friends and I tried it and got a meh amount of flora and nowhere near as many enemies as expected. And interior was basically non-nuked (which sorta made sense, although the top is pretty much open-air).  But others have been kinda fun
---
Positive support syringes! Stims, buffout, mentats, AP regen, speed boost hell yes
---
I've got 250 levels of medic and I can give you my experience.
---
Reviving perks are awful. Getting downed without being killed outright is exceedingly rare later on. They're useful to rarely I haven't used one in ~190 levels.
---
There's no way to share radaway. The better radaway perk is borderline useless because water is free. If your team has rad problems, rad sponge and eat/drink is the answer. Or share rad sponge. It's amazing.
---
If you're using rifles, then a vats crits commando build with a medics rifle heals more than I ever could, with zero resources expended. It's sad.
---
Power armor is mandatory for medics because you can spam stim packs.
---
Good luck. It's a hard wasteland to medic in. I've been having more success as a medic/tank combo.
---
Curious if these are bulked prices? Or individual each?? Great info post lernerd, thanks for sharing!
---
I don't know what you're talking about.  305 stimpacks and 113 rad away are completely nessisary.
---
I don't have a problem.
---
GT- MeritedNewt7538 I wont be on till late tommorrow so I cant confirm whether I have it or not till then
---
there was a pioneer scout challenge that came out after if you haven't tried that. not very exciting though imo, but can give you a cool item
---
I've literally had a full set of unyielding sentinel marine armor for sell since the vending update and someone barely bought it like an hour ago
---
I think Bethesda forgot to put it in the loot table.
---
That's awesome, i still need to revive someone.  Are you on now by chance?
---
Awesome! I love it!
---
I call him fister roboto. And the best part? *He's learning*
---
Why don't you go to Billings Homestead? There's tons of Razorgrain there.
---
I think it would be neat if during the event we got an assortment of syringers that could buff the creatures we're supposed to defend, or essentially mutate them into a new form of that creature.
---
In regards to the alpha that spawns I think there should be counter measures in place around the room that can weaken, immobilize (temporally), or cause the creature to flee from room to room as the fight progresses thus allowing the use of more counter measures. Of course you'll be able to bait it into whichever rooms counter measure you see fit at first. Then you'd need to adapt as nature intended.
---
Best spot if u have enough of the other ingredients
---
No but 69 caps is popular for many items. As is 25000
---
That bs issue happens with not only 76 but with bethesdas ESO aswell cant count how manny times i get screwed out of shit when getting trolled by low lvl fucks who come in at the end just to get last hit screwing me out of loot
---
Sometimes inside locations you have to wait for them to be killed then re-spawn
---
You talking about Fallout 4?
---
Haha nice,i paid 60 euro for it,worth every panny!:)
---
Whenever I tried to do it that way the game prompted me for my Beth user/password. This way, it's already been entered in the launcher and it just starts the game without any of that grief.
---
Now if they could drop the new "news" screen they put up, and give us the option to hide the game mode we don't use (I never play Survival)...
---
No idea on a nerf.  Don’t think they are very popular.  A nerf implies that they were overly effective, which I never found to be true. 
---
The MIRV concept means smaller explosions but more explosive units for a finite amount of weight, such as missile payloads or throwing ability.  Concept works well in real life because it still can kill.  But in the game it doesn’t and is best used for tagging it seems.
---
I had a vampiric something something drill that did like 12 dmg
---
Travel around other vendors, look at their pricing. Ignore the ones that have mole miner gauntlet plans, or chemistry workbench plans for hundreds/thousands of caps, and use the rest to figure out your pricing.
---
Trying.. Dookiestorm
---
Yes it is, but it'll be a little bit till you get there 😉
---
Gatling gun is probably best heavy gun( not my favorite so I got rid of mine)
---
I was meaning other then ark dungeon
---
Any good videos showing how to do it?
---
Not going to work. People are going to use them as an extra stash. Just out junk for 25k on them.
---
People need to understand that is not a simples task do increase the stash limit. Even for a 50 lbs increase they will require lots of server power
---
Opinion: I think Bethesda should do a revamp of the legendary acquisitions. The legendary vendor is popular but the majority of items are scrapped. A long term method should be used to select specific mods for a weapon and added to the weapon. They can even place the mod in Misc like the repair kits and make them not tradable. But the concept would be to be able to add a mod to any weapon, as long as it didn't already have a mod type on there. Example would be Unyielding and Chameleon cannot be added to the same primary mod slot. But this long term effects would be significantly higher costs of mods. I'm talking 1,000+ per mod, some mods cheaper if they are tertiary effects. But heavy benefit mods would require a slow build up. The reason I say this is there are so many perks that have specific references to crafting, but there's no point in them since legendary weapons can't be crafted. We can't redo a durability on a weapon. 
---
With this system we would be able to craft the highest durability on the weapon, then slowly add mods to our dream weapon. This was the idea that they kind of teased for "getting that dream weapon" but it's really just more random junk legendaries. 
---
I don't hate the RNG vendor, but it's not efficient in achieving that "dream weapon"
---
So with weapons like these you mention, you would be able to mod them with the dream legendary effects you want! But of course once you add a mod it can't be undone. So choose wisely. But of course, instead we get RNGesus.
---
This is truly amazing.
---
Live to see your special
---
I figured it would be a while before I used it lol. I guess I just assumed it’d be more rare than finding one so early
---
More like a sense of pride and accomplishment. 😉
---
Theres a whole cave system that runs north of watoga, I've seen some people build in different places along it
---
Jesus Christ, mechanics don't exist purely to make the game easier, they exist to make it FUN.  
---
What's the mechanics for the Alpha right now?  Shoot it in the face.  Is it running after you?  Jump on some crates where it can't reach and shoot it in the face more.
---
But with ACTUAL mechanics?  Someone could fill a bait trap to lure it away and take it's attention for a short time.  Or someone can run to the drug lab and retrieve a tranquilizer that reduces it's mobility.  Someone can run to the control room and activate a swarm of friendlies that briefly join in the fight.  Or a serum that buffs the defense target to help out.  Or ANYTHING other than shoot in face, repeat.
---
Next up, nuking horde bosses
---
Thanks you. Happy to see that the feedback is picked up and passed on. Don't forget to also thank the team for all their great work, including you guys!
---
Hm. Could be. It was just regular scorched (but fewer than usual) and we didn’t take any rads.  Wasn’t worth the effort, but got to cross one nuke zone area off the list
---
I have listed these prices as individual prices. Some people that bulk the items sell for the same per individual, just multiply by the number in the bulk. Some people with super excess like to bulk and they'll sell at big discounts. Like you see I put cloth for 1 ea, but someone who has 20 bulk cloth, each contain 30 individual cloth, might sell their bulk cloth for 20 caps. This is also a good idea for stuff. Steel is another one, it's pretty easy to come by, so the bulk steel has 30 steel scrap, seen it sell for 15 or 20 caps. Just depending on the data.
---
The harder part is getting the amount you need. But then you don't actually need them if you just use a website that solves them automatically and gives the codes. The codes are the same across all servers for the week.
---
i always price my plans based on, is it common? is it rare?  will most people have it before level 50?
---
im still gauging my legendary weapon and armor pricing though
---
Ahh okay, I just sent you a message. I work all weekend unfortunately but I’m interested for sure. How much are you asking?
---
The fact that they take 10% from our vendors but don’t have a main Appalachia bank that can hold I’d say 100k caps &amp; we have a 25k personal max. Fee to put caps in &amp; to take it out (10%) &amp; if they do that take away the 10% from my damn vending machine
---
I definitely would too, it would be so much better that way
---
Kinda like slender man
---
I did it too. Had a fluffy snaygaster to protect but only can get one goo friendly so the other two die and u don’t get the good rewards
---
I would like one too please.  GT: Take12.  I'll friend you tonight.  I'll be on all day tomorrow.
---
ok, don't think so, at least haven't found anything other yet
---
They're crazy strong. I stopped using them because half the time they clip into the ground and don't work properly. They nerfed demolition expert back when, but they're still 7x 160 or whatever damage.
---
Also, they always weighed twice as much. Try ordinance express for maximum results.
---
Too bad the game has hemorrhaged so many players it's hard for people to play with non randoms.
---
Later in the game when you decide to launch a nuke you don't need all those code pieces. There's a website for codes so you can launch it with a quick Google search. If you want to actually do the decoding by all means enjoy the game and hunt :3
---
I'd honestly love just a read-only API.
---
I want to plan my builds similar to most of the existing build planners, but with things like actual weapon damage based on my current load out.
---
2.5k for the FE or 1k for just the furious
---
I can't give away stuff at my vending station.  Gonna give up already.  Selling 5.56 and shotgun for 1 cap each and no one's interested.
---
But then players can just 'camp' to get on the leader board for longest life. I did the when survival first came out and stayed on the top with a total of about 3 or 4 hours uptime.
---
We can't organise with others, there is no global and no text chat. You'd literally have to walk up to every player and ask them with a mic and hope they have their voice settings enabled to hear you.
---
This is so wicked! Good work!!
---
No. You can still do it normally. They changed where...in the workbenches, examine the item. Then there is an option to repair. On PS4, its square. Depends on your platform.
---

---
Nope , unless ur with friends No one does the objective. I be run it at least 10 times now and only have won twice and with only one friendly. It’s really really frustrating to see no one putting shit in the trough or protecting the friendly.
---
Always thought the weights were absurd.  From my days in the Army, the M16 was fairly light.  Hell, our M240 coaxial MG for our tanks were STILL lighter than what they list a fully modded handmade rifle for.
---
Now the tank itself, however, was a bit on the heavy side.  😗
---
One of my heavy weapons weighs 0.06 pounds right now :-)
---
It’s just a flair. I think I’m enclave
---
Xbox?
---
Basically whatever you want, make sure it’s place on a rug. Move the rug around outside (on the road), then you’ll be able to take it to where you want.
---
It works for power nipples too (although only the ones on the ground). Place them on the rug in front of the generator, move the rug with the nipple on it a few times and you’ll be able to move it through walls (this can also be achieved with doorways, have the wall be set to a doorway, place the nipple/pylon where you want and then change it back).

Well now I feel like an asshole but also thanks for the info

pulling the wire isn't that hard.

I’ve tried it 12 times now. 4 failures due to noobs &amp; 8 crashes😍 I’m loving the new event!! It’s unlocked a whole new soundtrack (the brain melting sound of my game freezing)
---
Alien or Flatwoods Monster? I have a photo of me fighting the Flatwoods Monster AND the Mothman at the same time.
---
Wtf are you replying to? It looks like you commented on the same persons comment with 3 comments irrelevant to what he said... I’m not trying to call you out I’m just very confused.
---
Well hope it works out for ya. Would love to see pix
---
Hmm, if I crafted a handmade, I could finally burn up all that 5.56 ammo I have.
---
No. You need to press X for Details (While on a crafting station) and there you got Options, one of them being "repair kit". Right of that is the option to repair your item as usual.
---
Weird. Queen of the hunt loads every time I log in. Kind of annoying tbh lol

I’d like the leader board to stay, but get rid of the part where it marks you on your map.
---
What’s the steel farm?
---
Im having a problem with taking photos of Fireflies and Radscorpions. The grey text is appearing in the viewfinder but still not crediting me when I take the photo.
---
Have you tried doing repair all from the camp machine
---
Get yourself a set of Puncturing Knuckles and start swinging. You'll find out things aren't as easy as you think.
---
Walking there from gaully mine fixed this for me.
---
Well it’s worth a shot right?
---
This is good. Upvote for you.  1, 5c, and 6 are huge problems.
---
When?
---
My brother and I launched our first nuke Saturday night (central time), and chose there.
---
That damn lizard had terrorized the region for too long!
---
Have you found a fix yet?  I started to crash after my 5th time doing it. already tried 5 times all crashes
---
I have I can’t even access the hedge in menu  to repair it. Most of my buddies are having the same problem in high creature attack areas.
---
Great question. I'm surprised it isn't asked more often.
---
I keep a vampire's 10mm vampiric auto pistol to tag stuff without killing them.   Thinking about using some of the lame legendaries the vendor dispenses to see if there is an actual use for the garbage being dealt.
---
Syringer isn't useless (-25% DR darts) but should def not be in a legendary table.
---
Woah there buckaroo... slow down there and use them points
---
Well, at least you told me before I went looking for them.  Thank you.
---
This is a good idea, especially for the community! Looking good man. I wonder what other challenges you will come up with
---
When I am out that way I usually come up to those turrets from behind. Much easier to deal with them that way.
---
Tried to start it with someone today, bring more ammo and food/water. I had to quite because I couldn’t find a biometric card.
---
He said he didn't care to deflect criticism for the bullshit he's been spouting. It's an incredibly childish way to respond to being corrected
---
So you would define 'good at survival' as 'replenishing any and all needed materials from Survival player kills'?
---
I like the radio idea, perhaps you could check the population count of a region by checking at the government radio stations since they were used by the responders as scorched alert systems.
---
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
---
"I was wrong so it's not important now" lmao get off the internet
---
Yes, the first round didn’t go well I had to leave. I need to build up more ammo and I couldn’t find a biometric key card, I think I’m going to wait and get a microphone too. It’s hard to communicate.
---
I don't think the Flatwoods Monster counts as an alien. I've had alien related challenges, fought the Flatwoods Monster and it never actually counts towards the challenges. I really hope this means we're getting more alien stuff! Or... maybe the game is just broken. Who knows.
---
They wouldn't because this idea isn't feasible at all.
---
Same here! Everything I hit the button on the elevator my game crashes!
---
Screw that noise. We should have a working foosball table so I can challenge customers that stop by!
---
But that damn AT AT ... Im just imagine, walkimg through Watoga just to see this in the Distance.
---
Its Awesome and terrifying together!
---
AMS Corporate HQ.  Honestly, I wish more areas were this difficult.
---
That's not what happened, the guy spouted bullshit information about two of the most common ammunition sizes and when corrected, he calls the guy a gun nut and says it doesn't even matter anyway. That's childish as it gets and I can't see why you are defending him.
---
Hmm downvotes to n this post hmmmm weird much
---
Exactly.
---
No it’s not an old post and the Gauley  mine worked for me
---
The way this game handles staggering is so terrible.  It's like Bethesda learned nothing from oblivion and goblin warlords.
---
That's funny. How about not building your camp on the peak of mountain so when i spawn in i dont fall off the side.
---
thank tou
---
Have you tried unequiping, logging out. Then logging back in and reequiping. I had this happen with my weight reduction armor perks and this fixed the issue. Just a suggestion but may be worth a try...
---
Added weight is punishment cost for modding it. It’s not supposed to weigh the same as real life. It’s your handicap for choosing a modded weapon.
---
ehh no, ppl would put crap in stores too get you interested
---
Where is the hostility? Defensive much? He told you to Google it, that's not a hate crime.
---
Yeah I jus my made it in but now I’m dying constantly lol
---
Makin pancakes. Makin bacon pancakes.
---
Probably right on Bethesda dont care that much. And I do see your point, I might use rifles more if they're lighter. I was more do justifying it as is more than arguing it's accuracy. I still think a wieght reduction perk set for rifles would fix the problem 4 most part.
---
Lol
---
bro cAN I COME CHECK THAT OUT ?
---
People are visiting camps now more than ever with the addition of vendors, why not add more stuff to do while we're there?
---
Not directly aimed at you but..
---
Because he didn’t and the gun nut did get randomly aggressive. To be clear he’s only being called a gun nut because this was a small thing someone was corrected on but he still went over the top and got rude for nothing.
---
Repopulate!? Not while there's **science** to be done!
---
This is true!  Lol   or under water, or locked in the basement.
---
Repair Kits you have to buy from the atomic shop. 
---
Improved Repair Kits you earn from completing the SBQ fight. 2 each fight. These things are the best ever.
---
He said he didn’t care about guns that much and that he doesn’t care about listening to some dude not politely correct him but attack him for something he was fine with being wrong about.
---
I have twenty-one 50% fusion cores in my CAMP for 50 caps and 10 100% fusion cores in my CAMP for 100 caps. I've had them there since the day the CAMP vending started and NO ONE WILL BUY THEM. It's driving me up a wall.
---
I’ve done the event once, and I was that person. The event was already in full swing when I got there so I started off by just killing enemies, only saw 1 friendly very briefly, then was trying to grab stuff to throw in the troughs, then the next thing I know there’s a level 100 Grafton monster so I get 3-4 hits on it and start looking for friendlies to protect...couldn’t find one though, the event hadn’t failed so I knew there had to be atleast one alive somewhere. So I decide to go for the alpha as I figure if any friendlies are alive, killing the alpha will end and complete the event. I got quite a few hits on the alpha, health is less than half (there was one other person hitting it with me, a good 70 levels lower than me) when I die. I respawned and couldn’t find my way back to the alpha. So I figured at that point I’d wait until the weekend to try again, and maybe get a couple of friends to do it with me. I did have fun though!
---
This is an absolutely terrible idea because everyone will just list items for 9999 to get free stash space and you'll never find a good camp that's actually selling things. Learn to manage your inventory and use all 5 character slots. I somehow doubt you have max inventory x5
---
Shows how far game has come in development...
---
More to kill more exp :)
---
Yeah it was PC
---
Happened to me, sometimes the pieces of power armor switch frames
---
Lol that isn’t the point though nor is it even relevant tbh if you can’t find a couple of dudes to help you it’s on you.
---
Do you really want a pop up every time a messenger event pops up? Fertile soil? Leader of the pack? Defend X workshop?
---
...that's why we need the ability to choose which ones we get notices for.
---
Don't survival points come from XP gained now?
---

All I see is pussies downvoting you because they can't handle losing 100 caps instead of 12
---
Is the burrows not effected by nukes anymore?
---
This is so inspiring - new goals for my own C.A.M.P.! Well done!
---
Well, it doesn't cost any extra money to get back into it. So if you do get back into it, my tips would be to explore the new content before googling how to complete it. Lol
---
That's extremely likely, but the leaderboard ultimately doesn't matter. I think that the overall playability of the mode is much more important than the potential for people to cheese the leaderboards. 
---
I think that the leaderboard should pretty much just give you a little idea of how things are going on the server. 
---
Having high ranked players on the map drives pvp action, which conceptually isn't a terrible reason to have the system, but having players marked shifts the focus of the mode too strongly to JUST pvp. It's still Fallout 76, and it would be fun to do Fallout 76 stuff with the tension that open pvp brings. 
---
I want tension and difficulty in 76's survival mode. 
---
A full on pvp experience can be found in other games, or perhaps in &gt;!Nuclear Winter if the data mining plays out how many people think!&lt;.
---
He immediately accused the guy of being hostile when the only thing said was "Google the sizes, they are clearly different". The guy is just embarrassed he was wrong and is lashing out by saying he never cared anyway and calling the people correcting him "gun nuts". It's pathetic
---
Yeah, but I don't want to forget the several days in which I was listed at the top (for the week).
---
Ooooo shadey
---
I had one camp i spawned in. Literally stuck in the rocks right next to it with nothing but slopes on either side. I messeged the guy and said i was stuck. How does he expect people to check his shit out? He wanted me to fast travel somewhere else, then fast travel back to his place. I'm not blowing 30-40 caps just to see your over priced shit. I went somewhere else. He lost a customer.
---
Only if they buy something maybe. 90% I go to has junk anyway. We should get a refund from your cap stash for waisting my time and caps lol. Kidding that would never work. 
---
But if it does go your way (which it won't) I'll load up my stash with 100 non Legendary armor, weapons, loads of ammo, and chems so it looks like I have a lot to offer just to get that small percentage your talking about. When you hover over my base it will appear like the gold mine. So everyone on the map will travel there. Again that would never work.
---
cant wait til they do "find 3 friends, take a picture of each as they jump off a bridge, then you jump off a bridge too while wearing a donkey suit after drinking 5 nuka cola quantums, you must die and then your 3 friends have to drop at least 100 rotten foods on your corpse" - 10 atoms
---
I'm still learning to reddit okay lol. You saying this made me find the reply button.
---
Nice :) This will be useful, thanks
---
The point of this mode isn't to force people to restart you moron , its to let high level characters duke it out vs each other. How is that not competitive?
---
No he was being rude and the guy said he doesn’t care to get shit on for it rather than calmly and politely corrected. He openly said he’s not that into guns so why it makes sense that every person regardless of their interests would know about bullet calibers I have no clue. All he had to do was tell him he was wrong politely.
---
The "gun nut" said what that was hostile? He said "Google it". Bro you are defending some childish nonsense from. Someone who can't accept they made a simple mistake and got a simple correction. There was no hostility, just a butthurt kid who knows nothing about gun calibers and doesn't want to be corrected
---
(XB1) GT: AlexAutoAxe
---
And yet they were perfectly capable of removing serum recipes from the SBQs drop pool. I just can't comprehend what discussions go on behind the scenes. Do they enjoy hurting us?
---
Even if you did get in, it'd be laggy. It was for me. Lots of stuff going on at once. My screen jumps as fps drops hard.
---
All you do is cap it at 100 that's easily an acceptable amount to lose when dying
---
Which is why he said he knew nothing about it and went along without hesitation that he was incorrect and then says he didn’t care after the guy got rude. *right*.
---
I don’t think it’s the fact that you show up in the map, it’s the reason why. It’s shouldn’t be whoever survived the longest, it should be the person with the most player kills on that server, or something like that.
---
"he was being rude" go back and read the comments again. He said to Google it, that's not rude it any way, he made no rude comment, he didn't leave any snark, but somehow he gets labeled a gun nut and and rude. Lmao okay buddy
---
I base it off the value of the item which you can see. If i think it's too much or I'm tryimg to get rid of it, I'll lower the price
---
That's literally not what happened, he jumped straight to being rude to the guy who corrected him and accusing the correction of being rude when it wasn't because he can't handle being wrong and called out whoops
---
Say no. Earn your caps.
---
I hadn’t thought of this, so thank you!
---
Nice job! My camp is built in the same exact spot, but I haven't used any glitches to place stuff so it's pretty sloppy.
---
I moved there when survival started up. No doors at all, the only way in is a wall I store and replace each time. Back when being alive too long put you on the map it was my refuge to drop off junk and aid.
---
Now that survival has changed away from time-played and I don't need my 1/2 camp budget worth of crops to craft 50 beers a day for atoms I've been wanting to rebuild or move.
---
Odd that both of us thought he was being rude and let him know only to be met with him being rude. Odd that you care sense much about it too. It like you’re just like that dude and just wanna randomly fight someone on Reddit. Good look.
---
Quite simply, it is an Alternate Universe. Many people forget this key aspect.
---
We’re reading two different things then but if you say so lol
---
Threatened? What the fuck are you talking about? He said to Google it. Go home dude you lost this one
---
As soon as they start instancing events and dungeons and raids we'll have shared loot, xp etc. I hope they do that for all events. And install a group finder.
---
Unfortunately not, there are many times I hop to a vendor, spending 40 caps across the map and they're selling everything way too much. You just have to figure out if you'd like to pay for that or not. I only know of the way too much from experience of playing the game and interacting on the market sub.
---
You just replied to my comment where I said 3 times "he wasn't rude" and you say "odd that both of us thought he was rude". Are you drunk? Is English not your first language?
---
Do the crashes vertibirds count? Like at the airport and in Watoga?
---
1. It needs server wide alerts if it is public but also allow for private instance while also allowing for larger groups (like a group of 12 players). Simple fix.  
---
2. This is incorrect. The event is spawning new enemies by default to keep the combat going.  
---
3. This event wasn't designed to be solo'd and if you attempt to solo it or play it with a very small group. That is YOUR FAULT.  
---
4. Again, above. If you're playing the event solo or with a very small group and no one else... The punishment is very valid. This event doesn't take that long to do and you can easily wait 5 to 10 minutes for more players on the server to join before starting Stage 1. If you start Stage 1 without enough players and then complain that it is hard... It is your fault, not the event's.   
---
5. While I do agree that the Alpha RNG ENEMY needs some more interesting mechanics... They aren't a big bullet sponge and can be killed in 30 to 45 seconds if you have a big enough team playing the event. Now, I do agree that the monster's damage needs toning down a little. It's a bit too high and due to the RNG element of it... You can't have a proper tank build for the boss since you don't know what the boss will be. (Big bosses like this is when specific enemy type DR armor effects are really good at. Even with just two Hunter's pieces, I can tank the shit outta of the Sheepsquatch easy peasy).  
---
6. Friendlies do need more health/DR depending on well you've done, and needs to have health regenerate in between waves.  
---
7. Not gonna argue against this or agree with this as this is more of an opinion thing. I personally like this as it allows players to get rewards for doing specifically what they choose to do. If you want everybody in the event to get that extra legendary reward, then fight the final boss near the friendlies (but not near enough where the boss can kill them).  
---
8. The point of the reward system is to keep people playing the event and trying harder to get a better score and perform better. If you have a token system, no one would care about maximizing the effectiveness of the event because it essentially doesn't reward them for anything special. It's just "Oh, have some extra tokens!"... Sure, it'll take less runs but depending on the prices, those extra runs may not even matter. BUT they can change the chances of the rewards and tweak them a little so that it's possible to get unique rewards while still failing a little.
---
He sounded whiney (which is ironic considering he portrayed the sub as that)
---
The comments are still there and the way people are voting agrees with what I'm saying so I don't know what your problem is. Try reading the comment chain from the top again.
---
The person you claim is being defensive and I. Obviously. You’re rude too lmao
---
hmm, I think I've seen the charge when looking around at another's camp
---
I say keep but have it exclusively tied to the amount of kills you have. And make it a area circle so people don't know exactly where they are.
---
That way the pvp people will have a general location to go to fight each other.
---
Would never happen unfortunately the servers can’t even handle the shit we have in the game haha
---
Maybe it would be nice if loot dropped even if you didn't tag or do anything? So a low level that just likes to explore could find Whitesprings and get their hands on a ton of weapons/junk etc because of course it is usually cleared.
---
Destroy it and build another. Happened to me on my alt. But I kept finding them in random places and so I just built a new one.
---
I’m really not going to continue this. The guy was wrong, he was rudely corrected, he was ok with it, the guy got super heated about someone not knowing bullet sizes since it’s so important in life and vidya games, and then got defensive back. See ya.
---
Ok asshole, why are you talking to me like someone close died? What the fuck loss are you referring to? If you had anything worth saying it doesn't show.
---
No, it's possible to find an actual Alien like from Fallout 4. However, most Alien specific challenges does work with both a normal Alien and the Flatwoods Monster.
---
I thought it now has an armor rating of 1?
---
Currently halfway through my planned 27-level respec a week later :(
---
Dailies actually proc every 2 days, and it's server dependent. You have to server hop.
---
They need to add ALL the dailies to the personal computer, so we can just activate them that way.
---
Also I can’t believe you just suggested Reddit upvotes/downvotes are a solid evidence for the conclusion of human behavioral disputes
---
on PC?
---
If you bad at combat in general, i would try to make a vats build. That way you an just auto lock all your enemies with ease(except for assaultrons).
---
The only reason I can of why they don’t have that option are for people like me. I made stims, then wanted to craft diluted stims. I wasn’t paying attention to how much water I had and just kept spamming the button to craft...then I was out of water 🤦‍♀️  Took a few hours of consistently emptying my purifiers to build my water stash back up. That’s only a guess on my part though...and truly my fault, but the only reason I can think of 😁
---
No they dont
---
I honestly second this. I do enjoy my Arcade Machines in Fallout 4. They're pretty fun. I would love to have them in Fallout 76.
---
Is there any chance to stop asking that questions
---
Yeah... 12 attempts 4 failures due to idiots &amp; 8 crashes... I haven’t even crashed 8 times on the SBQ....
---
You aren't using full auto and you think you have a good pvp build? Do you have a discord server? You should get some tips from serious pvpers because that build won't get you far against sentinels
---
Faster than... What? Actually being able to Respec?

---
Ah damn we had all three today. Had 2 formula p plans, 2 bear arm plans, and a lot of coats so far. I really want the diffuser. Did anyone get other formula plans yet?
---
Tie it to caps based on level of player and this will be perfect.
---
Maybe 10 caps for each level you have.
---
Hm... in FO4 may have referred to the green glow; makes sense. 🤔
---
The correction was not rude, and it was the first guy that got heated and tossing insults. Why are you trying to blame the guy that posted the correct information? Quote his post and show me the rude part.
---
Lol tonight, I like this though haha.
---
It could be that speeding up play is a balance issue so they prioritize it. If you can save time it's probably an opportunity to increase your caps/hour or exp/hour which have a designed maximum to maintain the economy and progression balances.  
---
I doubt that's the case for the Syringer/Drill issue though.
---
You could also look for just normal rain. I jumped on survival and climbed a mountain, saw some rain clouds in the distance, done.
---
&gt;	power nipples
---
Lmao this is my new favorite thing
---
Try me.
---
I found out the hard way. Hit max caps so I disconnected the power and BAM, people were still buying. Lesson learned I guess.
---
I got you XGC ARTIMITIES is my gt
---
Good question.
---
Nah something is wrong with this event, period. The 100's of posts of people crashing out and experiencing invisible enemies, enemies in the floor, several minute load time of objects, sprites not rendering and coming in as red squares is proof enough.
---
So you’re saying we perceived text differently? I will be utterly damned
---
Like the OP said, that is failure by design.
---
You could scrap earlier then you could exchange
---
Can this be only be done during the event? I've explored this whole place top to bottom several times and not seen any way to do what you've said here.
---
This is a dispute over factual information, the first guy was wrong about the calibers and got offered a simple correction, he rejected the correction and got told to Google it, which still isn't rude. Why are you so up in arms trying to defame the guy as a gun nut just because he knew 556 and 762 aren't interchangeable? I knew that and I've only known about these guns through video games.
---
Most impressive
---
How do you get the robot to heal the animals?
---
Game is full of bugs don’t buy it, it’s fully unplayable
---
Tell everyone who wants to ask that question that IT IS NOT WORTH BYING and do not make that posts again, thx
---
I wouldnt mind area circles, pinpoint is absurd though
---
Why
---
You can use VATS in melee combat, too. So you could try it immediately without changing anything. It works better with fast weapons like knives.
---
Scattered around or vendors
---
So here's my thoughts and what I practice: plans and recipes are typically half value, unless rare or in demand due to it being new (like Recipe P now) which you can put a premium of say 2~3x value.
---
Useless legendaries are typically pegged at 250c per star but because they're useless and you might be in need of stash space, you might want to price it lower just to get rid of it. Many are actually just selling off to vendors (after they maxed out scrips) and players could buy a 2* for less than 150c, so I say go with what you value.
---
Average legendary with good stats obviously can go higher but I noticed most buyers buy point is around the 2-4k region even for a 3* item. If you don't sell it in a week, might wanna discount it more but sometimes you just might find the right buyer.
---
Popular items now like sentinel armour can go 5k and more. Check out the marketplace for some going rates.
---
Frankly I always go cheap for things I don't use and are heavy just to save space.
---
IMHO the Appalachian economy has now been so heavily inflated, its very easy to make max 25k even without player vending. I don't use a mule so I typically value space more, and had to often shut my vending down due to max caps. 
---
Now I just think about what to collect with my caps.
---
I disagree, migrating points slowly over time is a perfectly valid system, being able to just respec the whole character instantly would make it so easy to change everything that the already paper thin mechanical identity of characters would disappear entirely.
---
Ahhh glory days indeed!  Now THAT was a proper Fallout game.
---
Yeah yeah an executioners lever action with vats crit damage is super fun to nail crit head shots on a bloody build, I understand how the build works. But any automatic bloody weapon will absolutely shred your single shot build because your shots can get eaten by serendipity and sentinels procs, but full auto will reliably get a stagger with the tank killer perk and that's what takes down sentinels.
---
From what I can remember. Atlas Observatory has Level 1, 2 and 3 Terminals, and from memory Eastern Regional Penitentiary also has a few terminals there as well. I hope this helps.
---
I see the radiation has done you in...
---
Lighter than standard (helps with stealth), plus adds the “shadowed” effect, and I’ve also read it makes sneaking speed faster (but a bit hard to tell with Speed Demon on).
---
If I found a full set of three-star weightless armor with weapon weight reduction, I’d use that instead, but I don’t think I’ve found one single piece ever with that combo.
---
It's actually bizarre to declare you were killed by someone who sucks at killing, come to think of it.
---
Sounds like you're finally admitting you read it wrong
---
This is not a dispute about factual information. That was settled immediately. The disputes now is who was being rude which is just text on Reddit and the fact you’re taking such a firm stance on this is actually hilarious. You’ve lost sight of the conversation and based on this exchange you should take a short break from Reddit and get some more sleep available. I stand by what I said. In my eyes the guy got rude because someone didn’t know something that not everyone would know and didn’t even deny that he was or could be wrong. Simple. If you disagree that’s fine. Simple. Ironic you got rude about it.
---
I most certainly did not do that😕
---
No... I’m saying we perceived text differently... I guess I am damned... 🤦‍♂️
---
It's awesome, when it doesn't crash..
---
I'm fully aware of what i'm sacrificing being semi auto. I'm bloody semi auto though, and believe me I make it work. Seriously, do you have xbox? I will gladly show you.
---
I think they could at the least be in the playstations gallery. Thanks!
---
I'll try it out, thanks!
---
I'm still waiting for you to point out what he said that was rude. I think you saw the comment accusing him of being rude and just agreed without question even though it wasn't true and the guy is just being defensive due to his bruised ego
---
Also to be clear, I don't vats. I avoid it via stealth. I can aim. My ap goes to dodgy. Seriously do you have xbox? I wabt to show you.
---
They failed to make a team oriented event? Is that why this post literally says you get shafted if you’re not in a team? Ffs Reddit
---
Yes, there was!
---
😊
---
wow what live action? Like gifs?
---
Oh, nice. What legendary effect do you use?
---
No I'm pc sorry
---
Sounds like you're just mad that you can't afford to dish out 25,000 caps for a "super rare" Mr.Fuzzy plush!
---
 It's not like people are forcing you to buy 'em. My entire junk tab is just "Teddy bears" at ungodly prices, which in itself is a joke. I would tell you about the salt and wine I have for sale, but it seems you already have a surplus.
---
That's what i've done as well
---
I did not delete anything
---
Oh my god you actually have a problem. I stated multiples times why I think it came across as rude. I’m done responding now. You’re creepily invested in an entirely subjective debate on Reddit you won’t remember in a day.
---
I also suck at combat. Go support team!
---
Pretty sure I never use gold silver concrete or half my meds about 30 outfits 2 sets of armor and 5 weapons but I manage to stay at 750 lol we need at least 1000 let's hope it his 16 hundo.
---
I have seen comments in this sub in the past that sometimes the status of "Diseased" can override or hide the "Legendary" status of ghouls. The bug, if any, is more that they don't show that they are Legendary Diseased Ghouls. (This is something I've read here at some point, and I could be misremembering)
---
The larger problem here is the combat in general.  There are a handful of good ways to build your character, and unless you utilize one of these builds, you are dead weight and relatively useless.
---
This has nothing to do with legendary items.  Legendaries make these builds better, but legendaries can NOT bridge the gap between someone utilizing (as one of many examples) a VATS crit build and a random, piecemeal player with a few of the damage perks on.
---
Events are harder with more people around because most of these people don't contribute anywhere near what the game expects them to.  It was painfully obvious with the robots in the pylon sheepsquatch fight - where most players chip their health away, and a handful of people that actually read the perk cards and used common sense disintegrate them almost instantly once they're up the hill and in line of sight.

The entirety of the combat in this game, as well as enemy resists, health, etc.  EVERYTHING needs a full re-balancing.  When a dozen or so of us get on one server and do anything, event bosses melt in seconds even if the rest of the server shows up.  The scorch beast has not lived more than 30 seconds after she's vulnerable in months.  More often than not, she only lives 10.
---
The events need to be better.  Lots of things need to be better - but none of these changes will matter past novelty until combat itself is fixed in its entirety.
---
Listen, is changing weapon for tagging so difficult for you? wow
---
You should look in a mirror kiddo
---
I'd play survival if character were seperate from other gamemodes
---
I will try the roof on my half walls, you may have just saved my sanity.....
---
Is there any chance you could either A, stop being a twat, or B, continue to be a twat without having to comment unnecessary negativity?
---
Wouldn't the stars still pop up tho?
---
Thinking about going on a chem binge and digging the junk I never use
---
No like pictures of bad guys about to mess you up because you are standing there with a camera. Totally worth the stimpak.
---
I mean, if the wendigo stood straight up, it would be pretty spot on. lol
---
*rolblox “OOOOFFFF” noise plays*
---
But I love your reply 😆
---
Sounds like they changed it, last time I died I lost over 300.
---
Why does this remind me of the bear scene from super troopers so much?
---
How would looking a mirror further clarify my stance or yours on this matter? Exactly what does that sentence contribute to your argument or in what way does it tear down mine? You actually need psychiatric help.
---
Cool story bro 👍
---
IIRC you don't run into the explosive turrets until later levels, unless a higher level spawned them and walked off. Harper's can be hard as hell at level \~30 even without them though. The mid level supermutants are really tanky.
---
Honeyhammy203 on PSN! I'm level 46, would love more people to play with.
---
Oof you're a gun expert and a psychiatrist now too. How do you find time for reddit?
---
h
---
Ok I got ur point 
---
Only question I have why not to search for that question here? When I want to ask smth, I’m always checking maybe someone already asked that
---
Shit happens.
---
Whatever I find, can’t afford to be picky. If I could choose, however, I think it would be fun to go for a full set of life-saving and make dying a thing of the past.
---
Waiter, can I get more salt please?
---
Yeah that’s fair to me, let me know which you still have and I’ll try and get together with you!
---
Deep pocketed limbs is on the Camden vendor for some reason, IIRC. Buttressed is a scrap mod, so start farming the plastic, rubber and asbestos. You'll need a lot of it.
---
You have a stash you know..
---
Glad you agree
---
If they remove all the drinkable water and sitable seats would that help the server? Lol I keep trying to loot bodies during firefights and lay down or drink water on accident lol
---
Damn, that honestly breaks my heart because I assure you i'm a different breed with my full unyielding harder to detect armor and faster fire bloody handmade.
---
Well still in all, get over it. Everyone wants a small banner to come up when events start. So stop crying like a little bitch saying it’s going to be in your way. Not like you’re doing anything important that a 2 second small banner is going to ruin your experience. If it’s something you’re going to stop looking at.. GOOD less assholes joining events and keep it to people who want to play them. The world isn’t just about you homie, get the fuck over it.
---
Except perks dont apply to items in the stash so my 26lbs of stimpaks goes to 260lbs...
---
At what point did I claim to be a gun expert? At what point did I suggest I was psychiatrist? How did you conclude finding someone mental unstable requires a degree in psychology? Are you out of arguments or so freakishly perturbed you’re trying to say vague and near meaningless statements to win an internet argument through attrition?
---
Exactly right, and thankfully Beth won't continue to cater to the children that want infinite carry space and/or "realism", but only in aspects they dictate.
---
Try selling power armor pieces.
---
&gt; And suddenly a bigger shithead arrives.
---
Yeah, I'd say so. 22 days later, suddenly you're here.  
---
Got potato chips?

---
Oh good, more of that game development critique from someone who doesn't, which I always come here looking for.
---
Or make them better?
---
there's no competitive integrity when it comes to building and developing an account better than everyone else. doing it in adventure and then transferring it to survival is just kills the competitive nature of what the game mode should really be. surviving as you build an account and coming out stronger than the rest.
---
Be warned, it is EXTREMELY ineffective and nearly pointless.  You'll be far better served with stims, team healing/perk sharing/field surgeon if that's what you want to do.
---
Craft Arms and scrap them. Or come to me if you're on xbox. I've got all the mods but dense unlocked
---
Lol using melee is good when your low on bullets! Don't feel bad good weapons are a dime a dozen with scrip. Lol medics a good roll in any battle!
---
Haha sorry, do you want to fight my full unyielding sentinels character or my full cavaliers melee character? I have over 900 hours of playtime and a of survival mode. If single shot was good it would be in common use, but it isn't. And even then, your build would benefit more from an instigating type weapon than a bloodied.
---
There is no character identity, and respeccing taking forever just makes people not want to play.  Nobody wants to roll a new character to level fast.  If I get a cool legendary, using it unless it fits in my main spec isn't something I can even attempt without ~20 levels to see if it'll be comparable.  Casually playing, that's two weeks.
---
Just let me sacrifice caps/resources/whatever to even lose a few levels to move more points around.  Very few games feature respeccing this slow for a very good reason, it has no purpose and drives away players.
---
Also, ROFL character identity.
---
NEW EXPLOIT
---
Ok, we’re both seeing eachother’s points, but as everyone’s mama told them as a kid, “If you don’t got nothin nice to say, don’t say nothin at all”. You coulda just ignored this post instead of being rude. Not tryna be your fuckin dad or anything, but come on. Leave the guy alone. It was just a simple question, he meant no harm by it. We gotta be keepin the community positive. I now realize that it was foolish to have lashed out at you, as that contradicts the entire point I was trying to make. And for that, I apologize.
---
It's useless as a standalone weapon. The strongest barrel you can make deals 4 damage per second.
---
Hey. I'm glad you got the nice guys answering you.
---
The drill has some potential to be reworked with a massive buff and more mods, but the syringer and flare gun are clearly gimmick weapons that would not benefit from being legendary and should never have been put into the loot table, especially considering it is impossible for them to have any legendary effects applied
---
Fallout 76 is like a box of chocolate's.
---
My guns and armors legendary effects don't seem to be working!
---
I would abuse the fuck out of this mechanic.
---
I would sooo love to fight someone that could destroy me without using an auto tesla rifle. Stealthboy non stealthboy idc, I have unyielding sent for stealthboy fights. Also not scared of melee since I just escape artist and jump lol. I blow people's minds with what I do with my build, most dont even believe thats what im using when we're done fighting.
---
Cripple it cripple it cripple it
---
Whitespring has always been this way since ever.
---
My theory is that too much spawns in the area and the game loses track of what’s what.  Ever notice the only crown enemy you see is the ghoul in the pool area?
---
The place is just damn odd, but I hope they never fix it.  Game needs more wacko places like this, not less!
---
Try R&amp;G station
---
Be sure to shit on the Bethesda anytime you're confused
---
Lucky guy! Well I've just hopped on for a quick half hour before I have to go to work if you can get on mate?
---
In which way? Care to elaborate?
---
Yeah i haven't tried again yet. I went to whitesprings to look for the camera and just getting legendaries from non legendaries haha I'll pass the event for tonight
---
There are mire dailies besides queen of the hunt? I guess none of them spawn for me then lol.
---
Yeah I had the same issue with the urban armor mask.  I couldn't figure out wtf was going wrong until  I saw the armor rating on it.  Durp.
---
No sometimes it will say legendary (enemy) and won't show stars but still drop a legendary
---
LMAO.. That's the BSG bug. You get \*\*\* drops from \*\*\* enemies 20% of the time, the rest is usually \* suff.  Everyone has been waiting for BSG to fix this 'oversight'.
---
Honestly it feels like whoever gets the drop first is going to get the kill, good players can land their shots and the best guns shred any armor and you just have to be the best at positioning and outsmarting your opponents, good luck in the wasteland.
---
I now crash half the time I eat food, I used to be one of the lucky few that rarely had issues not now I often just don’t reopen the game, agreed we need a stability patch.
---
I'm glad your bush got fucked up, Beth can sell all the goofy inconsequential shit she wants
---
Yeah sorry did not have time to pick out the ones i meant.
---
Better than the corpse just instantly disappearing.
---
Nope, but I'm sure you'll have plenty when you celebrate successfully figuring out how many days have past since your comment about masturbating to someone crying.
---
I was doing the Fever a while back and someone was 1 shotting the Supervisors with TSE.  After the second one, I just pulled out the 2Shot The Dragon and wasted the 3rd without the other guy getting a hit.   It was just the two of us, so did not want him to tag it.
---
okay i faced my fears and exited the vendor screen fully expecting him to despawn or just die like he usually does and i reentered his shop and it allowed me to buy it. If this happens to you just do that.
---
phew
---
Murder unsuspecting people, grind quests until blue nameplate, murder unsuspecting people, grind quests until blue nameplate, etc.
---
I actually really like this idea.
---
QotH is definitely broken. It hasn't triggered for me in months.
---
Same thing-ish happened to me. Must be a bug. I don't even bother with the legendary vendor now.
---
You sounds like you're upset and really dedicated to getting the last word in. It's pretty sad.
---
Repair all at your camp..xbox is y.    you don't open the build menu
---
So soo big
---
worked again when i exited and reentered thw shop screen so
---
That’s definitely not why you’re still replying with short responses while I further dive into the ridiculousness of you’re current replies
---
Meh
---
I can confirm from personal experience that sometimes the "diseased" pre-fix for the ghouls can block out "legendary" from popping up. It also prevents the stars.
---
To be honest that's a possibility, but the way imagine it, being hostile would drop your karma rating fast, while it would take quite a lot of killing mobs and quests to atone. It's not a 1:1 ratio.
---
Can’t wait till she messes your hairy deathclaw bush up !!!
---
Why lock the door. What are you hiding. 
---
You are only encouraging people to leave a bag of fertilizer and toilet paper on your bed. 😈
---
That's true. You too. Sorry to bring out my dick and the ruler. I just really love semi auto it's a lot more capable than people think. I'm sure if I used an auto build i'd be even better but honestly I don't chase meta.
---
If you learn the mod for right arm does this carry over to legs and chest?
---
There's a drawback with gun fights... you'll be trapped in the endless cycle of ammo making/hunting/conserving.
---
Whereas with a 2h melee build will always have fuel to bash heads in.
---
Personally I'm saving card perks up to make a shotgun build...
---
Your attempt at amateur psychoanalysis in a reddit comment is a sign that you take this too seriously, yes my replies are shorter than yours because I'm not as invested or as mad as you are
---
You aren't the only one my good friend who is extremely annoyed and bewildered by this. I like to keep a good even amount of junk in my stash but since vendoring that's impossible. Hopefully Bethesda hear our cries for help! 🙏🏼
---
No potato chips, got it.  
---
That just means you'll have to eat my ass.
---
Have at it, and have a good night.
---
Yes. You can learn mods for all pieces from scrapping arms, which have the lowest mat cost. I do not believe you can learn dense from scrapping though
---
I agree if they are going to have people showing up at all it must be kill based.
---
most people give it away for free by not locking their purifiers. I dont even look at aid items.
---
Oh shit don't give them ideas. Before we know it if you DON'T complete challenges your atom points will get drained.
---
I tend to give away a lot of goodies to low level players before doing bad things.  I'll make it work.
---
https://youtu.be/Szt9te3uv_A
---
That's merely your opinion not facts. Building a strong account in adventure doesn't kill the competitive nature at all, it just means it needs more fore though and planning I knew this mode was coming so I prepped for it. Not only that forcing people to create a new character is bs, what about new players are the ment to just be forced to show up with a level one character while this mode has been out for a while then get dumpstered? What about people like myself who don't want to be forced to play this whole game over again because the story is boring for 90% of it and it sucks?
---
My replies are not psychoanalysis and you continue to reply without substance because of this social problem I’ve already suggested to you.
---
Cool I had to do this for handmade as well. And you can get all the mods this way?
---
I believe all of them but dense
---
Yeah I'm fine by it, most legendaries I got at one time
---
Why do you deny doing something when the post where you did that exactly thing is hovering just above?
---
For the wolf, go to Widow's Peak, kill the mole rats there and then proceed slightly downhill to NW till you find a pack of wolves. Here's the thing: you now have to lure the wolves back into the Ash Heap (they're on the border of the Forest/Ash Heap and if you kill them where you find them, you won't get credit taking pics of their bodies there). Repeat: Lure the wolves back up the hill towards the Ash Heap and kill them/photo them there.
---
How do you get dense ?
---
Lmao you’re intentionally ignorant. You can have you’re weird victory
---
There is no point play longer than hour, because of this. Cool.
---
Or something like you hand a weapon and scrip to the legendary vendor and it is given effects depending on how many stars you are willing to pay for. That way at least the weapon can be one you've already made and would use.
---
It would ask for you password? Lucky.
---
Mine would just error out about invalid internet shortcut and that was it. I assume my Launcher install has issues
---
When ever I get low level items or plans I already know or even extra aid I dump them in places where I remember having to go through the game at the start. I try and hang around to make sure a low level gets them. It seems to work out pretty well too.
---
The code pieces only last 1 week - then you have to find new ones
---
... or you can take the easy way and use the weekly solve codes from https://nukacrypt.com/
---
I would do that but I have a machine specifically just for brews so I decided to include purified water in there too for the heck of it.
---
I also have my purifiers locked, sounds a little scummy I know. But I've always locked mine since launch
---
I haven't noticed this, thanks for pointing it out!  I have however had other players give me the thumbs down emote when I've dressed in the Enclave Officer's outfit......
---
Your*
---
You sound less angry if you ^lol
---
Exactly what I thought, the guys who wrote the code simply put in a wrong formula.
---
Oh god a typo
---
Im not sure. I have just server hopped watgona and the bos vendor there to find the mod, not the plan, when I need it. Has never taken very long
---
Sure :)
---
I met him dozen times. After a few times I started to beat him with Supersledge. It seems he does not know how to stand down...
---
I also met his brother, a winning-tron. Its a Mr. Handy and it gave me a golden pocket watch.
---
I left him alive for that.
---
And what would be the issue with that?
---
short answer: no
---
new events reward plenty, most folks also dont lock their water purifier
---
At this point I don’t want to let you have the last word because I’m actually creeped out
---
Please please let them stop asking this aaaaaagggghhhhhh
---
15k
---
Why would you engage in a creepy conversation? Jeez what a weirdo maybe you should see a therapist
---
Burn through the main quest as fast as possible then demand DLC
---
Lol all the toxic community members quit are complaining about Anthem!
---
I just checked on my main; both perk cards still boost meat hook damage, for me.
---
I have my water purifiers unlocked and I've still had some people buy purified water. Though not a lot And priced at a bout 3 caps... I think it may have a high level character seeing my ugly base and thinking I could use a hand haha
---
This is actually how you’ve coped with not swaying someone’s stance on an entirely subject matter and I just can’t let it rest now I wanna see how far it goes
---
Ish
---
Not for this game! It's like they accidentally made a ghost recon sequel.
---
Fair enough. I prefer to leave me purifiers locked but that's just me. Perhaps I'll lower it to 2 a pop since I believe 1 cap purchases are glitched. Maybe eventually I'll offer it free
---
bloodied is the best prefix for all weapons, as it provides the best buff (+~95% dmg) under the specific condition of being one hit away from death. If that's not your style, the best combo is:
---
instigating or junkie's swing speed +str 2h melee. Instigating if you mostly play against enemies you could theoretically destroy in one hit, junkie's for a more general overall damage bonus. Getting the max +50% from five addictions with junkie's will likely lower your strength, and that can be offset with unyielding armor. Instigating is especially good on a low health build with nerd rage and adrenal reaction since you are much more likely to one shot enemies, but at that point you may as well be using bloodied for an universal buff that's a couple percentage points lower.
---
Two shot explosive for shotguns, no question about it. Each pellet has its own explosion with 20% of the base gun's damage, meaning the additional pellet from two shot also gets another explosion and adds even more damage. You might not want this on the double barrel, as the extra spread from two shot might make it difficult to hit enemies
---
For heavy weapons it really depends per gun, but mostly you would want two shot explosive (minigun/gatling/gatling plasma/gatling laser) or anti armor fire rate (works well on all of them except the energy gatlings)
---
I liked the karma system in FO3, I think having a karma system in 76 would be cool but in adventure. 
---
In survival it’s supposed to be risky. It’s kinda like jumping in an animal cage at the zoo... maybe the bear you walk up to is going to be nice, maybe he’s going to rip you to shreds. Never know and that’s the fun of it. My expectation when I jump into survival is anyone I see I’m 99% likely going to shoot, if they put their weapon down and show a friendly emote or something then I think twice. I’m not a shoot on site person, I’ll watch what happens first, but like I said karma in survival I don’t think belongs or it changes the game mode to LIFE. 
---
Karma in adventure would be a much better thing, but then splash damage has to come back to players (not necessarily camps because player vending, but count towards karma if you attack it or not). The more you harass players by attacking them or camps your karma lowers for a server specific amount of time. Bad karma means you get worse XP, vendor pricing, drop a SMALL random amount of aid items and maybe 1-5 caps depending how bad you made your karma. 
---
If you put pacifist on then you appear green (not good karma but not bad, you’re just neutral) you’re not participating in the karma system. Shades of blue to maybe having an angel next to your name for good karma, and well red for bad with the devil horn dude nest to your name.
---
If there’s a karma system like that I think it should be on a timer just like the vendors, a full day and then it resets to neutral. 
---
By the way in this PvP won’t be initiated unless both sides attack but the initial person that started it gets the karma hit. It would add a better dynamic to the game I think. Even if you are bad you can be good and even if you have the best karma you still have to be careful of your decisions and where you’re aiming.
---
I was playing alone. I wasn't in a team. I just had friend on the same server.
---
True, but it is a pain if you snake the cable through a wall.. or several walls
---
I would love this. I never kill people who haven't killed others but when I see the "hunter" I take him down or die trying... often just die when they one shot kill through walls
---
I.e., you’re a troll that’s out and about
---
I liked the event due to its design and layout, but the event itself can be easily with 4+ players (which means NO SOLO PLAYERS), I don’t see why people are complaining about it. I agree with the 8 points you made here.
---
Bro stop replying its actually creepy
---
It is still available. Head over to Fred's and it should start.
---
Sentinel is slightly nerfed, bloodied is still best.
---
DJ Han(d)s up-Load (Give him a german accent)
---
Even at its worst, to me it was an enjoyable in spite of everything.  I also got it for my daughter and she would comment on just how pretty the visuals are.
---
Highest dos weapon is bloodied +25% fire rate .50 cal followed by the explosive version.
---
Use heavy gunner, nerd rage, bloody mess, stabilized and you are set
---
It's virtually removed already, a huge departure from the initial design. I guess y'all really won't be happy until you have a  kiddie pool to yourselves.
---
Unless your at the overseer camp probably not. Sell it to the train vendors for 5c if you really wanna make money off it. Should be free to players IMO
---
Foul language isn’t needed
---
I do that when I'm close to max caps
---
Oh I’m sorry I didn’t realize sarcasm wasn’t funny these days
---
Oddly enough people were outraged before launch?!?! Lol I understand constructive criticism but to boycott a game for not being exactly what you want was kinda bogus! If you read the amazon reviews most the negative feedback was about online only and no NPCs. Lol everyone worrying about griefers were the griefers! The internet has kinda turned into troll heaven!
---
I can't get very far with the radkelp. I thought I was just missing a node or something. :(
---
People need to stop worrying about tagging. If you want some Wood armor or a Junkie's Golf Club _go do literally anything else_. It's so silly.
---
The critter AI breaks enough that often the critters get stuck and you have plenty of time to tag. If they aren't stuck and there's a tick on the field because no one loaded the hopper.... !@#$ your desire for that Junkie's Golf Club. Marry that bug.
---
Yeah it's my first times experiencing it. If I get multiple like that in a row that's fine by me
---
Same :( I saw the marker for the event and decided to go try it. I went down there and accidentally died bc of an assaultron. As I was going to retrieve my dropped loot, the game froze (PS4). I get a lot of crashes and disconnects but it’s rare that the game freezes.
---
Yeah, that is something that can support crafting but still RNG the rolls.
---
You know, you jogged my memory on a meme I saw shortly after the announcement for this game.  It went something like this:
---
Fallout 3 - The search for your father
---
Fallout 4 - The search for your son.
---
Fallout 76 - The search for the nuke codes to destroy xXPussyDestroyerXx's camp.
---
What's the point of the survival mode if no aggressive players play there?
---
First of all, Bethesda has said previously that all content and future content would be soloable for those that like to play alone. Failure. I shouldn't have to play with randoms I care nothing about.
---
I want a bloodied kvlt burning ram's head Sheepsquatch _staff_. :)
---
Oh sorry wouldn’t want that lol
---
I don’t know what I’m missing, but I just did this with three or four randos in like ten minutes. But then I stayed down in the basement and started to get randomly one shotted by assaultrons... so I feel like there were some glitchcy issues going on
---
Free Range still shows up regularly, but it appears in at least three different places: Tanagra Town (east of harpers), Big Fred's BBQ (mid map) and somewhere north in the Forest.
---
Bloodied is still top of the damage pile by a distance. Sentinel was nerfed but it's still good. I don't use it myself because standing still is boring. There's plenty of other damage reduction to stack.
---
It can be done solo. I’m sorry it’s hard?
---
Here's how people would exploit that.
---
1. Load up your shop with non-legendary items. The shop preview doesn't discriminate between Legendary and useless items.
---
2. Move your camp far away from where players typically hang out to inflate the travel cost for most players.
---
With how these systems interact at the moment, that's a big fat no from me.
---
Gauss is ballistic for the damage type. The weapon type is energy, though. Maybe that's the line?
---
For 2H I'd say Instigating or Anti Armor as most max level weapons will pound most anything in PVE.  Everyone seems to want swing speed on their 2H's, but I think power damage would be the way to go for max damage.  1H really relies on SS to be viable, but unarmed can work with either.
---
That's fair. I'm not doing it to be scummy or make any money. 1-5 caps is practically nothing anyways, it's more for novelty. I figured if I'm wasting a whole vending machine specifically on drinks I might as well include it. 
---
I prefer to keep my purifiers locked but maybe I'll either offer it in the machine for free or just remove it entirely
---
Lol I'm doing the same with the big "keep out" backpack from the atom store.... I stick out like a sore thumb but I love it
---
Thanks fam
---
I've had this happen too....but I have noticed when I've gone to fix something, say an extractor at the powerplant, and the list of materials comes up, sometimes some of the materials are highlighted bright green instead of the dull yellow/gold.  I'm assuming this is to warn me I'm about to use an item for it's materials, and not just junk or bulked junk.
---
Attack him then, or do literally anything about it besides come here to give us an earful of bitch. Beth doesn't need to change this for you and your proposed solution would suck too.
---
You can leave it up in survival. Just don't .... you know.... Stay there.
---
Most players will use it as a FT hub and don't camp waiting for you to come home, but I'm sure someone will.....
---
It didn’t freeze for me, but the enemies seemed to either be not existent or spawned all at once
---
I love it. Keep it. It's got to be one of the most unique camps I've ever seen.
---
I’ve got one I can sell/trade you, are you on PS4?
---
Of course bro
---
Man, look at all the exclamation points. This guy’s serious. 
---
If you can’t stand the game, play something else.
---
Unlimited Steal, sounds like robbery to me
---
I just want survival to be separate characters and for me to be able to break in and take everyone’s shit. Much like rust, but I also want a separate experience like in adventure. Survival I think would be the PVP.
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
Dude I’ve been locked in so many basements it’s not even funny.... I ask them to unlock so I can check their stuff. Usually some do but a small few have been dicks about it “I can’t help where you spawn, go to another place and walk” was one response I got. No man, I’m coming to buy your junk I’m not spending more just to walk back and see you have trash. He owed a workshop so I got my caps back and LOADS of junk :)
---
I believe (99% positive) this has to do with the up and coming "Nuclear Winter" DLC/Patch and Vault 51 (Located in the upper left corner of the map)
---
No.
---
1. is the biggest problem for me. Having to hope you're on a server with enough high level people that want to do the event. Hate to say it, but mixing all the level ranges on a small server is becoming a drawback as they make more and more high level content.
---
It's specifically designed to punish those trying to do it alone, I'm sorry it's garbage.
---
I meant Rad-X as offensive - it would basically be a buff immunity applicator.
---
XDno it really was not
---
I do legendary runs and it's pretty much the same daily. Check map to see where everyone is, if my locations are busy then I jump servers. I hit WS then to the enclave bunker for technical data. Go north to the train yard and pick up a fusion core from that robot and make my way to Pleasant Valley train station. Usually 3-4 Legendaries but often many more. Then fast travel to Westek, hit Camp Venture to turn in tech data, then steakhouse and finally Harpers ferry. After I'm done, I go to Berkleys to trade in scrips and see what I roll. Final stop WS station to cash in all my weapons I've picked up. That's my routine although I get side tracked with nukes and such.

You don’t repair from the build menu, it doesn’t matter when you go to the camp stand and repair
---
You never know. I would buy some if I stopped by
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t poorly designed. I said it is technically possible to do solo. Should it scale? In my opinion yes obviously. Is everything they put out going to be a winner. Clearly not. Don’t get angry at me I agree with you. I just think we should chill on it. It’s not fallout 4. They just clarified today that updates won’t be slowing down. It was a mess from the get go and it takes time to make things better
---
Losing almost all chems on death is what stops me
---
Fallout 4 in the sense that we’d see like 5 bugs fixed 2 months from now with 2 reintroduced and then support ends.
---
What about the dead one in the dump truck? Hm.
---
More data showing BGS didn’t play test their own game updates again, just like the broken Possum/ Tadpole Challenges, their broken legendaries from the purveyor, the broken camera teleportation glitch, the broken drop rates on Fasnacht, etc etc....
---
Hey how refreshing another Bethesda cheerleader  thanks for the advise !!
---
the squishiest will be squished, those who are not squishy will not squish
---
So much bulllets : (
---
We can talk Darwinism when I'm not losing loot in failed events..... ;)
---
I don't think shotguns get the +20% explosive damage per pellet since patch 9, at least if the complaints are anything to go by. I don't have one to test. 
---
Quad's really good on double barrel shotguns.
---
Furious should be good on the faster-firing heavy weapons. As far as I can tell from the ESM, it should stack to +45% damage and probably doesn't care about misses, only time.
---
*advice
---
The questline does not bear repeating
---
be the one who cannot be squished, carry the event
---
No, but no one is asking for notifications of those, only *high level content* that we've *all been waiting for*.
---
So you and the other guy really don't want to know when the *new content is going*?
---
If you wanted to mute when a nuke drops, I would understand.. but relevant new content? Why?
---
Besides devs responded to the idea of us using terminals to mark events we want to do.
---
This hits the nail on the head for me. I don't want "forced" PVP I just want to play the game without the adventure mode restrictions. I have no interest in friendly mode or "PVP" mode, I just want a survival/RPG hybrid that this game should have been all along.
---
It’s the reason why I play it
---
Yes sir/ma’am. Didn’t realize you was da new boss. But I guess this means when the Bethesda 1c bullet bug hits a seller you’ll reimburse them, right? You do know about that bug don’t you? The one where when a buyer buys those 1c bullets the seller doesn’t receive the caps?
---
This is noise
---
Teach me to tank 3x pylons and Sheepsquatch. I will absolutely respec for it. Tips for Paradise on a circuit to protect all 3 animals also welcome. No sarcasm - I would really appreciate it.
---
Healing Factor + Regenerating gear barely keeps up with one. :| Speed demon can't cover all 3 troughs/critters.
---
I've never bought a weapon with real cash but see no issue with people doing this.... It doesn't increase their skill and even in survival I'm not sure that any weapon is truly OP (I've been killed by non legendary pipe rifles and my so-called good tier weapons only help with one or two shotting people, which doesn't help if they are already about to kill you and you can't VATS in time or they're using stealth boys)
---
Just gotta play the market. If you list something for 5c and it just sits in your stash for multiple days then think about lowering it. Its not like you're gonna use it. Keep lowering it til it sells and you have a good judge on what to list future like items for.
---
The whole mentality of people will just buy it and sell it to the vendor for more is just wrong.  Vendors have a set limit but player vendors don't(minus the 25k max). So you sell all your junk to the vendor and now everything in your stash is a bonus. So that junk you don't use is extra caps that day. Sure I can get 500c per mutation serum but I can only sell 2 then other stuff to get 1400. But if I sell them for under vendor price I get my 1400 from the vendor by selling non Legendary weapons plus how ever many serums I sell along the way at 200c. Hope that makes sense.
---
In all honesty I don't think Bethesda is going to do anything but laugh at those who pay real money for items that can be found in game
---
Wow the memories. I wore that ALLLLLL the time in Fo3. Best outfit hands down.
---
Because it’s a buggy mess?
---
Don't forget the burrows
---
I used to collect recipes, magazines, bobbleheads, outfits, and armor. Just cause you got it don’t mean you have to use it.
---
That’s such a burn, I think we should all show up with AK’s in hand and ask him the weight them all lol
---
Don't ask
---
Only problem. People don't show up on the map in survival. (Outside of the top 3)
---
Buggy and no alert that its happening.
---
Will they actually? I bought the friend welcome sign a while back and it's absolute garbage and can barely be read.... And maybe a week later they released the full letter set (I'd be willing to pay additional atoms on top of a refund to 'upgrade')
---
Well, technically, it IS armor. But I get what you are saying.
---
Thats wrong i just hopped in survival and got 12 caps a kill not only that a change like that would have been in the patch notes
---
I agree with you both, but yeah scroll down like 5-10 comments and you’re going to see the same question. It’s at least 1 time a day usually more, gets super annoying seeing the same question when you come to this sub to see what’s happening
---
So, this event requires some coordination between players. Usually an open mic is the best method for inexperienced players. But it doesn't help when so many players can't enter the event and if they do, their fps drop or they lag out and crash. There's a lot of system issues with that event beyond a complex mechanism. Most events I played have failed. Although it's cheaper than the squatch event, it's still aggravating to push through a buggy event.
---
That's a pretty good point. If they sell for around 5 at a normal vendor maybe I'll offer them for less than that. That way people will might buy them if they're able to profit by collecting their daily 1400 caps.
---
Feels less scummy and makes my vending machine feel a little more useful. Even if they still don't sell I feel more comfortable with that idea. Thanks!
---
The fuck is a stimpak diffuser?
---
Its totally crap, but its gone, I was doing Cryptid and then my game crashed. I didnt lose anything important but still super annoying since it was the game crashing that caused it.
---
ARHAHAA! Mine too :D
---
I can tell you one item price.. perfectly preserved pie is MINIMUM 10k caps 😂🤣😂 3 machines I went to had it for a stupid amount like that haha
---
Sorry to hear that. In the last month since I bought the game I'm getting this kind of stutter sporadically indoors and outdoors. But your stuttering looks worse than mine, similar to one I experienced before I moved the game to SSD disk. I'm guessing you have it on HDD?
---
Yeah that's my issue the place is a fuckin maze, there's no way to know where you are
---
Would be especially terrifying at night in the mire. I wouldn't mind more enemies that stalked us. Could even give them a massive damage boost if they attack us from stealth. Could incorporate a minimum perception or alter the perk card Awareness, to act as a filler if your perception is low, that will give the player a notification similar to,"You feel you're being watched." Then comes the game of finding the said creature or fleeing before it strikes. 
---
Honestly had hoped the Sheepsquatch would have been on of these creatures, but perhaps one day we can truly feel fear in walking the woods of Appalachia at night.
---
I tried that it didn't work for me.  Does it have to be raining hard or a drizzle?
---
I give it away for free at my camp. I even put a big sign up for everyone to see. Just next to the Vault 76.
---
Well I guess it's bug that every assaultron can one hit kill but other than that I didn't see any?
---
Weak troll
---
Flatwoods monster
---
It was a light rain when I did it, what did you take a picture of? I think there needs to be a subject in the picture
---
Put them in your stash....
---
Mods r on this subreddit...you just did.
---
I’ve had the same prob, only 2 people at the event, I can only guess people either tried to attend it but crashed to dash or they owned workshops and didn’t want to risk crashing and losing their workshop, I’ve don’t it 4 times now and failed every time due to lack of people there and being the only one putting food in the hoppers
---
Missing a 3, .223 round can be fired in a 5.56 chambered weapon but 5.56mmx45 round has a higher pressure when fired and shouldn't be used in a weapon chambered for .223.
---
I totally agree. Thanks again
---
LOL.... I hit every "pie" machine I find, and I have never got a piece.
---
Apparently - because I have not seen the thing myself and I am not even sure if the plan can even drop... the local copy of the esm would indicate that it can't but I don't really know what the server-side capabilities are - is a type of stim that 'shares' the healing effect with your team.
---
You need to use three of those to complete one of the tadpole challenges.
---
I haven't went because I am working on my future monongah mega garage for power armor. like a library of leveling power armors for peeps to borrow and return. currently still putting together the initial sets. its a lot of hopping and searching at all the power armor spawns. once that's complete I will be posting it and running it. cant say I care about the scouts or the arktos content to be honest. my friends got all excited for the arktos thing. me I just got hyped cause I learned you could rename power armor frames in the inspect option. new content ?- scouts? arktos?mmm meh RENAMING POWER ARMOR FRAMES!!  HELL YEAH !!!!
---
personally when i do the event i run power armor with lone wanderer, Blocker rank 3, Suppressor rank 2, and a Vampire's Explosive .50 cal when the conduits are active i slowly back up as to avoid some of her melee attacks while vampire's healing stacks up for when i do get smacked. i also run both grounded and scaly skin for a little extra resist, i do use stimpaks when running towards the conduits. 
---
as for Project Paradise it is much harder to do so, since there are 3 different rooms.. far enough apart from eachother to make it hard to save all 3 animals
---
I think it's about the mechanic not the caps. Im all for higher cap loss/reward but I think the map markers really hurt the game.
---
... ho yeah, the tadpole challenges that requires you to be playing with other humans ?
---
To win an item that helps if you're in a team? 
---
I don't think I will give a fuck about those.
---
For the Sheepsquatch I throw on power armour with the medic pump torso, it fires a stimpack every time you go below 50 health with no waiting like the born survivor perk. Only thing that can get you is the Sheepsquatch if it slaps you so with medic pump torso on take all the pylons, jump on the shack roof, put yourself in that nook between the yellow thing and roof and use a ranged weapon to deal with the Sheepsquatch, I’ve been using a troubleshooter lmg.
---
I actually moved off the junk collecter south of white spring because I was tired of logging in and someone else living there. so now I'm in bfe near monongah , no water no resources , just a watermelon patch which I eat for food and water. oh and my garage of course.
---
For me the issue is getting people i want to do it with onto the server before some rando fires up the event. If you're not loaded into the world before it starts, you're fighting invisible enemies and the food isn't spawning for you so you get 3 radroaches to defend and they're gone immediately in the next phase.
---
Again another stupidity by Bethesda, you should keep that option to repair items with material and as well add repair kits. Not playing the game anymore, nor spending money on it anymore
---
Obsidian
---
Well that’s another issue altogether that I hope that would at least acknowledge soon like ffs if it’s not done loading then why are we pretending lol
---
with this patch for localization in Italian you have "ruined" a lot of texts, probably do not take the correct string number
---
I use nuka cola t51 B power armor and vampiric laser gatling. I dont even have to stim pack usually. and the nuka suit looks nice af.
---
That doesn't work because then you get kills for defending yourself.
---
Even then, the mystical power of crouching can still be employed to not be on the map. &gt;&lt;
---
No.  It's a free market.
---
5 troubleshooting gear, max cola nut perk, nuka quantum.
---
Ya it's about the map markers because that's what the post is about. I'd prefer cap loss to be capped at 200 simply so level 400s can actually play lol
---

---
No, Bethesda owns the rights to Fallout.
---
...I literally play survival just to snipe people. I'd have such a red nameplate, but i'd also be crouched and invisible so noones gonna see it anyway.
---
Yep ! Although I'm not sure if there's a limited time period for refunding stuff in the atomic shop. but definitely worth a try !
---
I’m happy to see that my bitchy comment has brought nice players together :)
---
thx for info
---
I know you wrote this over a month ago... but thanks. I needed some of these exotic Nuka-Cola drinks for the Possum: Collector challenge.
---
Other descriptions I've seen and read (including in this thread... ahem) are pretty terrible to be honest. Even the YouTube videos I've seen featuring Bubbles don't show how they get to her. Except for the main shopping area downstairs, I find the inside of Whitesprings very confusing so this search has been very frustrating.
---
This is just some more camera challenges. Easier then in game thought
---
Beth might own the rights to the franchise but obsidian as devs may own the rights to the music used in game
---
i dunno plasma rifles seem more ghostbuster-esk. with the flamer barrel of course.
---
I can confirm that it drops.
---
to fallout games yes, but songs are licensed for every game separately, so would have to pay license fees again to use it in F76.
---
Another thing is that Big Iron is wild west-themed song, not really 'fit' into Appalachia.
---
Hm, what a surprise. This crappy engine can't even handle ten creatures, and medium location at once. But they still want to make games using this shit.
---
u/valseeks
---
Thanks.
---
I am hoping that people will start selling those - the stims themselves - so I can get my last tadpole challenge out of the way soon.
---
Bullet Sponge is unfortunately not only an issue in Project Paradise but a huge fraction of the game.
---
That or multiple accounts. I have the latter. In all fairness that specific step was barely an inconvenience for me.
---
no, not really. because this sub-reddit does not allow for trading posts
---
I did the event the first time yesterday. 
---
- I died while getting the alpha down to 5%
---
- someone stole all my loot
---
- I didn't get a reward
---
- the friggin dead alpha disappeared before I was able to loot it.
---
I'm not impressed.
---
I haven't run it this way yet, but you can shut the aric (or whatever it's called) down and then you don't have to fuck with feeding. I don't know what this does to rewards, but it sounds easier to solo the event this way, plus if you're only after the 3 star then it'll be fine.
---
This.
---
No, my purifier is open, so everyone can take yourself a water, I use it for myself and still got more than I can use and sell it daily to vendors.
---
I'll be searching for one if a PC seller surfaces through this post
---
Ik I’m posting this on every fo76 subreddit
---
Hopefully now we actually get to rebuild the factions by joining a specific faction
---
I disagree heavily with the idea of instanced dungeons in this game on a matter of principle, but I think the rest of this is a great critique on the state of the event and where they can go with it.
---
I have a ridiculous amount of Steel, Leather and Cloth. This method is great if you're just starting out and really need the resources but by level 10 you should have accumulated a very large amount of junk.
---
Been doing this since beta, that launcher takes too much time to load even though it's installed on a very fast ssd.
---
&gt; They aren't a big bullet sponge and can be killed in 30 to 45 seconds if you have a big enough team playing the event.
---
I solo'd one about that fast and I'm not even that strong compared to some of the god roll players I've seen. I've got a junkies explosive lever action and a junkies explosive minigun. Thank you legendary vendor and patch 9.0 fixing addictions.
---
Thanks mate! Gonna keep this one as a cheatsheet ;)
---
I guess he means faster than waiting for respecs ? &gt;D
---
pretty sure they know its been around since the start - if you have super duper and all the perks etc I am not sure they consider it an exploit. you could theoretically level up that way to but I would rather get poked in the eye with a sharp stick than sit there and just grind levels like that.
---
Blown away! Awesome work! Guess that's my whole day gone listening to this song.
---
What about that mod (no news is good news from nexus)? Is it still broken since the last two patches? It worked perfectly before. Can't check it myself, out of town rn.
---
Are you assuming my friendship orientation?
---
Stop crying and play another game if you are not happy with how they do shit, please
---
No. I didn't. You just blurted it out to the first person you thought would listen. Another trait of the mentally insane. Should I make a phone call?
---
I'll try it.
---
I was doing grounded, insulated backpack, and dropped blocker for Traveling Pharmacy for Stimpaks. Maybe that was one of the mistakes. I skipped PA last time for the higher ER and used a troubleshooter pickaxe and troubleshooter handmade to try to clear and get everyone on the sheepsquatch.
---
On PUG with no teammates I always end up swarmed with all 3 pylons and Sheepsquatch. T51B with Emergency Protocols, Berry Mentats, BE Gatling.
---
I can solo Paradise and have 2 out of 3 tries, but tell second another player shows up with Assaultrons my Tick gets eaten by like... A stupid bloat fly... downhill we go.
---
Paradise?
---
so i think i ran into one of these hot servers. i encountered legendary enemies in ever corner of the map, arktos popped up and was filthy with legendary robots. west tec was hotter than its ever been for me. every stop on stings and things had one. i now i have a pretty sweet suppressors sledge/croquet mallet that is wrecking faces. that was pretty ridiculous. that should dilute the salt in me for a little while at least.
---
After having to deal with the **incredibly basic** ISS mechanics almost alone every time it spawns, I can't disagree more. Just give me a bullet sponge because I don't believe that half the people in game either care or understand how to accomplish anything on their own. That puts a huge burden on just a few people making the event unfun for them.
---
Fun nerf inc.
---
Well, any song from NV would be a nice easter egg and reference. It doesnt have to be Big Iron.
---
Well my informative friend after work I hauled each frame out of storage one at a time and relabeled them 
---
made myself a code system so I can easily look in inventory and mixmatch peices for complete sets. first is the level require ments of the armor then the type then a 1  for present peices or 0 for empty slots . so like an almost full set of level 40 t45 only missing the left arm and torso would look like 40t45101011. I grab a peice out in the wild rename it pitch it in the stash and when I feel like sorting I pull out the ones that match each other. I completed three sets yesterday. anyhow I am happier than a hog in mud and the monongah mega garage is creeping toward creation. should make some good progress this weekend I am off work. oh and complete ones are just level type and the letter c IE complete level 15 raider set would be 15rc
---
Sounds more like a 80's action movie with Stallone/Schwarzenegger.
---
&gt; This has nothing to do with legendary items. Legendaries make these builds better, but legendaries can NOT bridge the gap between someone utilizing (as one of many examples) a VATS crit build and a random, piecemeal player with a few of the damage perks on and a build full of stupid shit that is only useful in their imagination.
---
I cannot emphasize this enough. I keep seeing people in here complaining about this set of guns or that set of guns. I've got a pistol toon (the supposed weakest set of weapons in the game) that just ruins things. If you do not build your character properly, no amount of legendaries or "better weapons" is going to save you. Switching from pistol to rifle isn't suddenly going to make your character a god because now you have 36% armor pen... Hell armor pen is so overrated if you're not running a full auto build.
---
Imagine adding legendary effects to The Fixer or Perfect Storm. I would love those weapons so much more
---
I would play in survival only if this were the case
---
I'm not sure you know what fun is, guy. Look back over this thread in a few days, you'll see what I mean...
---
it took me 12 hours
---
Agree. One of the worst level up method i've seen so far.
---
Raining will do, you just have to a photo of something like a creature so that a name pops up in the corner before you snap the photo
---
The only way me and my friends have got over this issue is to go to the team menu, kick them out and then re-invite.
---
Believe me, they won't pay licence fees to expand list of songs, at least not now. I doubt they'll do it in the future too, it's a cost that won't return. You want NV songs - play NV or play music in the background ;)
---
Seeing how... steep the climb on the grindiness scale was from Tadpole to Possum I am awaiting these with a certain sense of... foreboding.
---
Found it thnx
---
Stash is full 😅
---
instead of "get in da choppah" its "get all da lethah"
---
Welp. Imma just leave you with this: there rly isn’t shit you can do about it, so just live with it. It’s not the end of the world. 
---
Peace and love my dude, gnight ✌🏻
---
If you mean because of the radioactivity from when they explode, that's just the fusion waste product being released in the explosion.
---
Fusion does produce radioactivity, but it's decay rate is much higher than fission.
---
I could have sworn that the major difference between our two worlds (from a boiled down perspective) was that we invented the transistor and they didn't.
---
I find that if you are moving at all while attempting to start or finish placing a wire, it won't work. So, for example, if you jump by accident and then immediately try to place the wire again after landing, your screen will still be bobbing up and down from the landing animation. Wait for that to be done, then try.
---
Also, even if the object it highlighted green, make sure your crosshair is physically over the object, otherwise it doesn't seem to work most of the time.
---
As for stairs, I've found that placing temporary stairs first in a place you don't want them, building the second story with most of the walls (obviously not where the stairs are) and the roof, then moving the stairs where you want them, works.
---
Dude, get real, reply to my comment rather than just down vote it. So you don't want notifications for high level content, and you would rather mute these new events, rather than the huge notification every time a nuke drops?
---
Come on man, reply rather than downvote.
---
I started the event today and NO ONE showed up. Still managed to get more than 60 fragrant venison, which spawned a deathclaw...who died very quickly to the level 100 Alpha Legendary Sheepsquatch boss that spawned. I was low on stimpacks but I managed to take him out solo. I got a 3* Auto Stim Right Leg with +25 rad resist and 50% more durability.
---
It was pretty fun! Altogether I must have walked away with about 6 legendary items.
---
put 300 pounds of chems in stash? I don't think so
---
I am a bit anti social because of the team mechanics in this game already haven't liked them from the start. I will continue to rollo solo amigo.
---
I have several with usernames
---
Fantastic, thanks for the heads up!
---
It remembers...
---
put them on a different character. idk lol
---
Gonna have to disagree. I would much rather Bethesda make fast travel to player camps free.
---
I agree with you, getting blasted in my workshops by explosive weapons all the time. I absolutely hate that the Only kind of player that tries to pvp in adventure uses explosive weapons. No one ever tries anything interesting.
---
Well nothing we can do, but maybe mods Pin one of the posts so people can read it when they come here and lock new posts when they have some kind of keyword asking if they should buy or play the game
---
Do you have talons and scaly skin mutations?
---
Not that either would actually cause that bug. It's just funny to think of a Brahmin thinking "jfc I'm out of here if that thing tries to touch me."
---
Hmmm no? I don’t server hop much, but once I did and got two chances to do the games about an hour apart. That was a couple patches ago tho, I don’t know now.
---
I would , before they put the overall leaderboard , were the only visible one’s where the ones Killing I survived for 54h ( did not die , the week ended and it restarted) . I really enjoyed the thrill of having to hide and see if the of the other players were just looking to kill or if they were friendly to go and wave at them and team up , just trade or see if suddenly they became hostile and then having to run away for the sake of not being on the leaderboard and staying alive .
---
Armour with weapon weights reduced by 20% is by far the best option
---
That’s awesome but also brutal because it’s not even halfway lol you have more than me, but I’m working on it.
---
that was a joke, got various legendaries and stimpak diffuser plans already
---
Powerful weapons at a price
---
I would buy the veteran ranger outfit in a heartbeat.
---
That would be true if you didn't have to keep loads of outfits for those stupid levelling and photography challenges, old rewards that you can never get back if you scrap/sell/drop them and so on.
---
Unless you're the conduit, yeah easier to just res near by and run back.
---
And especially if you're in Paradise.... We already have 3 squishies to babysit. :|
---
Problem with that leaderboard is I get put on it for defending myself. I didn't murder, I defended myself and now i'm being hunted. No, not hunted, tracked via GPS. It's really dumb the way it is right now.
---
I think, that I have that Mutations :D
---
That poor Brahmin :D
---
Be aware that they're listed as meds on player vendors, not stims, so look out for that.
---
God. Please. No. lol
---
Otherwise we'll soon have to do tax returns to Beth. *we're investigating*
---
If i see the event is on with no one there or just one person i cant help but not want to go because its too overwhelming and you always respawn outside the building
---
but how will i use them then?
---
There are a lot in survival...
---
I usually list common plans/recipes for no more than 20 Caps each. Ammo for 1c each. Chems for 15c each, although I might lower it to 5c each because of how common chems are at higher levels. Don't even bother listing Legendaries unless they're a decent 2\* or higher. No-one's going to buy your Zealot's \[Weapon Type\] for 300 Caps.
---
I am laughing myself. But i thought that there would be a legality behind it?
---
I find them a lot walking around the cranberry bog I sell them as well for 500 caps each and they go like hot cakes
---
Just deactivate the bots by shutting down AIRC-4.
---
You can take the elevator solo, start the event solo, but then... good luck lol
---
That happened to me a couple hours before the week restarted , I had to kill someone and after that it was really intense , I had like 4 high levels chasing me killed one and then I just had to take a break because I knew it would become even more f**k up the more I survived at that point. 
---
Who doesn’t want to hunt down a guy with over 2 days alive that is visible on the map??
---
There is boomer at the bates motel.
---
Guess I'll spend some time wandering the Cranberry Bog then.
---
While you’re hopping be sure to check the out house for magazines.
---
ive turned in i estimate above 400 documents.
---
its a long grind. made it part of daily routine :3 
---
it doesnt  matter if you turn in 1 or more at once.
---
After initiate it took a very long time for the other paints to appear for me. Missing sentinel as last one but i think that one is bugged? Can anyone confirm ?
---
They would have to completely rework their combat system. They’ll never do it. Just forget about it, it will never happen in this fallout.
---
Project Paradise is almost unplayable on PS4, beacause the frame rate is so garbage and Crashes happen very often.
---
I have found a ton of them everywhere around Harper's ferry in particular and a few other places in the bog. I sell mine for like 50 each but no one buys lol
---
Habitat B, same thing applies but use 5 hunter gear.
---
Nice to see another build here! I have my vendor, guesthouse and garden on the highway with my personal hidden cave in the tunnel. Will upload pics one day.
---
Conduits make that easier... but what I was talking about was right before the machine have a power connector on the wall, or on a post, and just connect a short wire to the machine from that point.
---
Remove that tiny section when you want it shut down.
---
If you want them all powered so they all look the same, connect one to the next to the next and so on. and to shut down just disconnect the first machine.
---
To answer topic question - screws.
---
Sorry for the ping but /u/ladydevann could you pass that ???? It's a real problem for every non-english player...
---
You can shut them down!
---
Habitat B is the Rad Stags?
---
You have to work a whole lot harder to get something useful from that quest, no? I can solo it just on the radstags but I'll end with 2/3 or 1/3 and get garbage in rewards....
---
Hahahaha Sin 😘
---
For anyone else looking for a place to get this done, just completed it right by the Grafton Monster south of the Charleston Station, there's a small pool of water there where we let the mobs kills us.
---
Yupp. Got some sick burns of him. Those scars will never heal.
---
What if the bit is larger?
---
Yup. Only thing you can hope for is other competent randoms to hold down the other habitats or a team.
---
I have a teammate that doesn’t play a lot, but especially since you can get 1400 caps in one vendor, he always logs on and sells just enough to get the 1400 and logs back off. Does this for a week, I see him on the weekend and he has 10k caps to spend. 
---
Me I play every day, and always find something I want for 500 caps and so I never have many caps at all, day to day.
---
They’re still there. Picked up a full set today. I am selling them on Xbox.
---
I love the title. lmao
---
If I had a nickel for every time I downvoted you I'd be broke. Get the fuck over yourself.
---
Of course I'd like notification of "high level content", what I don't want is notification for energy single event, which is why I was implying that we should be able to choose what notifications we get.
---
Do the imposter sheepsquatsh event a view times und you have more than enough.
---
Only rad worms are more common.
---
Wow!  
---
An Impressive build that's for sure.  
---
I wonder how many will now try to re-create this?  
---
(Or at the very least draw inspiration from it?)
---
Then why reply?
---
I would spend my real money for the first time, just to buy this armor. :D
---
Why someone should have a switch for the shop? lol
---
Concerned about energy costs?
---
Awesome, thank you! That will make events more fun. No more stressing about possibly making someone angry by taking their loot.
---
Too bad for your ears!
---
Thank you.  I was hoping that was the case.
---
I’m assuming you don’t have many
---
the boat Guy from point lookout also had à nice outfit
---
Gl getting bethesda to properly code "unwarranted aggression" and "self defense"
---
They would sell sooo much less 😂
---
"Godda kill sam moa stags for da letha"
---
If you let other people decide your opinions for you, then your gonna have a bad time.
---
Absolutely, I tried to play survival but at some point four other players swarmed to my CAMP to kill me creating a battlefield. When I understood that I was on pointed out on the map only bc i didn't die for 40 minutes i said goodbye to the survival mode. What a pity though, i was enjoying the experience.
---
It's not to segregate players, simply for identity purposes. Aggressive players can still pvp all they want they just simply have a red name
---
take responsibility idk what to tell you dude
---
I won't pay the game a second time just to do quests.
---
Not on the map, yes, but when you are within visual range the names on top of the players are shown.
---
Don't sell yourself short, very well done👍
---
Doesn't have to be complicated. Simply whoever fires the first shot is the aggressor, and his target would be self defending.
---
Oh, of course not. Having multiple accounts is not for everyone.
---
I just find it useful for other things too and the licenses have been quite affordable (at least in the EMEA region) for a while.
---
thats why a lot of people over repair their chainsaws, for that sweet damage bonus, now the chainsaw and similar weapons are meh
---
P R O T E C T A N D S E R V E 
---
Play next song.
---
Now.
---
Wholesome enough?
---
Tried something similar once. Once. Scorchbeasts can still detect you and scorched spawn in the caves if it gets pissed off.
---
Just wait till you get your back pack and see how ugly they made it so you’re desperate to change it’s look with an atom shop purchase.
---
You can add me and I’ll help you if you want! Btw I’ll launch one in Charleston.
---
AA Vats Crit Handmade with less AP cost. Have tank killer and perforating mag on, Run auto and spam the Crit button. Kills players and bosses in no time at all.
---
This was the only part I enjoyed. And it made me sad, because it reminded me that they can actually make engaging npcs if they want to. Just not in this game I guess.
---
Yea 4 damage on my chainsaw. Before the patch i used it for ws now its impossible even on 200 percent it does 4 damage.
---
nah, i'm, not touching survival until chems drop isn't changed
---
That's more complex than you think. And i'll be damned if i'm going to wait for them to shoot.
---
Why on earth should that be a thing?
---
So much agree!
---
If you help Quercus shutdown Arica, the friendlies do get health regen between waves.
---
Haha nice
---
i guess you arent playing surviva then lol
---
As promised!
---
I tried to make a realistic and lore friendly outfit. 
---
I also live in an abandoned train cart. It’s a good match indeed. 
---
Idk why but I love these types of clothes even tho they are some of the first things you pick up when starting. 
---
WEAPONS:
---
Main: Furious Gauss rifle, renamed: GP-X23
---
Secondary: all star chain wrapped baseball bat, renamed: Swatter (for those low lvl mobs)
---
OUTFIT:
---
Visible: 
---
drifter outfit + ushanka hat + green bandana (sometimes gas mask for the look) + black shovel backpack skin
---
Underneath:
---
BOS fatigues, full set of lightweight BOS sturdy CB armor (nothing interesting)

I'm pretty interested in what it says; does anyone remember any of their lines?
---
I would like a permadeath mode: you die - loose EVERYTHING including levels, weapons, etc. - start from the vault again...
---
Someone breaks you stash - all in a paperbag... 
---
But great loot on the servers...
---
The dudes with low equipment  don’t have much to loose but maybe winning big time and the dudes with the high-end loot might get even more but have to be super careful all the time...
---
I come from survivalgames like 
---
DayZ, H1Z1-JustSurvive and Rust - the death in Follout doesn‘t terrify me enough
---
You did all the athlete courses, killed 50 enemies with a crossbow, hunted down all those creatures with the correct weapon type, and did the terminal tests- in two hours? Call me skeptical but I’m not going to push the point if you get defensive.
---
Upvote, i completely agree. Finding some rare events is a pain enough even with server hopping. This would definitely help.
---
This would be fun if it wasnt such a broken game engine.
---
I’ll keep that in mind, thanks!
---
Probably just gonna stash it
---
They are ballistic as fuck
---
I don't lock purifiers - and I set my water to sell for 1 per just in case the purifiers are empty and someone wants it. I do get the occassional purchase but mostly they just stack up and get sold to the robot vendor.
---
So if you see a red guy you know it's best to shoot first :D
---
Radium aint energy weapon, its ballistic with additional rads properties, and is not considered legacy.
---
Pretty sure you can pull them from Murmgh
---
Not a big loss
---
I got a 3* Vanguards left arm today that magically turned into a 1* when I went to sell it
---
they need a special vendor near watoga who sells a Special un-craftable serum/chem that de-specs your character's special stats called "Spotless Slate" (or something else, IDK). you black out and wake up just outside of vault 76. after that you are prompted to re-allocate all 50 special points. he would refuse to sell you it unless you where level 50+
---
maybe have it cost a fair amount of caps, maybe something like 5K or more
---
Man, the system would be abused. You're thinking far too emotionally.
---
You're not commenting about lower level content. What is wrong with you? You're literally commenting on a post asking for notifications for higher level content..
---
Seriously, what the fuck don't you understand about what you're replying to? It has nothing to do with notifications about low level stuff.. is there something wrong with you?
---
I enjoyed it, to be honest. Sure, some of them were just annoying but being  a chef was fun; Normally I'd just kill and eat stuff raw or do the bare minimum for cooking. Or being a hunter with different weapons was fun to try new things out. 
---
Even magazine hunting. At first I hated it but eventually I designed a route to pick up a maximum of 48 magazines per run with plenty of other loot, enemies and random encounters along the way to keep me entertained and busy.
---
Tbf, ppl apparently disconnect a good bit in paradise (or can’t get back inside or something) so I might run over if possible. But it’s certainly not my main priority
---
Did you ask nicely?
---
&gt;Trying to connect from the other connection back to the one you originally started with (instead of C1--&gt;C2 do C2--&gt;C1). This is object-specific, so if this doesn't fix it, then you can move on to either of the other two.
---
This is very true for the advanced through wall conduits.  In addition for these specfic pieces, you will frequently have to start on the "pipe" section rather than the "Connector" and walk the wire round to the device.
---
Agree 100%. Especially in adventure workshops- the ONLY person who ever has the inclination to try and kill is is ALWAYS using an explosive weapon. Even with fireproof on somebody was just spraying in my general direction as I crouched and of course, I die -instantly-  
---
It’s always been instant death with explosive weapons. No amount of nerfing or bug fixing has ever changed the fact that you die in less than a second once they open fire in your general direction. 
---
Now me, when I attack- they get down to 5% hp, and then every shot afterward triggers serendipity and probably need rage and a few others and they never go down. 
---
The worst part of how freaking boring it is. Attacked and killed in one second by the same weapon on every aggressive player, every time. Hate it.
---
You lost me there. At which point of my post did it seem like I was talking from an emotional standpoint?
---
What makes you think that we can? Do you have any evidence or you’re just believing that it’s possible? 
---
I hope it’s possible, though I doubt it is. I’ve never read any report on that.
---
I mean that’s basically the slenderman
---
so there are legendary flare guns out there???
---
It's possible another player has milk that thing while you were away. Mine has been pretty much hit and miss lately not steady at all.
---
That quest only needs you to install something on the roof of the building. Going inside is just the route the game suggests you take. There is a fire escape on one of the sides of the building that can be reached if you parkour along a fence a little bit, or have marsupial/a jetpack to get to the roof. There isn’t really anything of value to loot inside. Just standard prewar building stuff, with a few semi-interesting computer entries/holotapes if I recall. Not a fix, but its a workaround you can use to continue the quest-line.
---
Ultima online was the last game I played that I felt got that aspect right. at first . originally the best items you could get were player crafted only. then they started doing magic weapons rng crap because wow came out and stealing a bunch of customers. I feel like by trying to mimic wow they just eroded their own fan base faster. UO could have been the best - they sold out what made them .. them though - listened to the wrong customers and did too little too late . got behind the curve and now have a tiny but loyal fanbase. fading into oblivion. I think fallout 76 could differentiate itself from the herd by making player crafted stuff equal to the rng drops. no reason both cant co exist. hate crafting ? farm for it. love crafting? grab the resources and make it yourself. have the resource farming requirements match the rarity of the rng drop. or even have a quetline for specific items to assemble even.
---
But I have that bug on every Brahmin
---
Bulk Lead @ 25Caps
---
Excavator Clibrated Shocks @ 835 Caps
---
Nothing else has sold more than once.
---
Bummer
---
Nah, most respectable legendary effects do far more than AA. It's a great starter legendary, but it lacks any real oomph compared to bloodied junkies furious instigating etc etc... If you're not a full auto build then don't bother with armor pen legendaries at all, you're more than likely doing enough damage per shot (if you built your character properly and are using good guns) that you're bypassing armor altogether (after tank killer and such is calculated.) My bloodied lever action takes almost no damage reduction vs SBQ for instance. It shoots for about 1k per round, at 1200 ish armor no longer is a factor, which happens every 2-3 shots with crits.
---
It’s always the entirely true posts getting downvoted. Have an upvote from someone who wants to use workshops and has been hunted by many, many tse wielding shotguns.
---
Cores is super surprising, since I only ever see they at exorbitant prices.
---
Mutton Pie is a big meme, lol. 
---
This is very helpful though. I can target this to better stock my machines.
---
no, it uses riflemen/commando
---
Ahah thank you so much!
---
Because LOGICALLY this will be abused. As nice as this would be should it work perfect, it's an unrealistic sensational idea.
---
Because it was not supposed to be a thing.
---
I like to think the radiation from the bombs mutated weapons and armor as well as the creatures. Therefore the only way to make new legendaries is to drop more nukes, and a player would die/become a monster if they tried to craft new ones as they would take a direct hit from a nuke.
---
6-7 mules common? No, neck beard, it is not.
---
😮
---
I'd very happily by 100% cores at that rate. I'd go to about 50/60 if I'm running low.
---
It just baffles me that cores are so high up because I only ever see 100% cores at 162c. Only for less if they're under 100% charge.
---
Wasting time to do a beautiful CAMP. There is no purpose to do that. I'm not surprised if bethesda is slo slow to fix the game and build some proper expansion. They must think "Why having an hurry? People have fun with useless things....we can take our time." Community must ask for NEW CONTENTS ASAP, and i mean, a BIG expansion. Game have still a weak end game, and some brief mission-event from time to time.
---
Yesterday I super over encumbered and was dumping junk into my stash at sunnytop station when I hear a protectron voice say "hey you stop" and then I heard him say "slow down" It was at this moment I realized that I was being hunted. I frantically dumped just enough junk off to not be over encumbered into my stash and  and I ran (slowly) down the train tracks and he followed me yelling for me to "stop" and "hey you" every couple seconds.  I was about to get to the observatory when I hear "Congratulations" It was Mr prize bot as I'm lumbering down the tracks past him hes starts talking to nobody. My hunter shoves past him barreling toward me then it happened pendant added you are now over encumbered and cannot sprint I made it a few more feet then my body collapsed from over exertion. I fell to my hands and knees I could hear his metal feet clack over I gathered enough strength to stand up and and face my attacker. 
---
There he was  a protectron weathered by time paint as white as ivory I readied myself, pulled out my trusty croquet mallet, and as he got into striking distance I mustered all my strength and with one well placed blow I slammed my mallet through  his head loging it in his chassis and he through slow garbled broken speech was atempting it, his final attack he was trying to insult me. 
---
I knew what I must do I pulled an orbital strike beacon out of my bag and shoved It deep within the protectrons head as It started locking on Modus came in over my walkie talkie "member there must be another way" I told him "I wish there was but there's no time. If he gets this insult off every living creature within earshot is going to feel slightly bad about themselves and I can't let that happen" then I heard it a the noise of junk rustling in my bag the beacon it was enough I could run again I ran as fast as I could hearing Insult bot  sloly mutter out two distorted words "your mother" then a missile from the heavens went straight down into him blowing him into millions of peices the shock threw me to the ground but I was alive. I looked over at my adversary and all that remained was a crater. In the crater I left a small brown paper bag containing the pendant, some flowers and some spoiled food then I left.
---
Accepting a nuke onto your face is nicely in line with my description of demanding crafting process &lt;3
---
has this happened to anyone else?  Can anyone from Bethesda respond please? :)
---
I went into the Burrows for the very first time today, after someone had just nuked Harper’s Ferry. There were loads of glowing charred ghouls down there, like 15-20. I got the impression it was because of the nuke, but I’m not positive.
---
This. Perfect.
---
I sent you a message via xbox so we can see if we are online then. My phone died when this message would of arrived 2 hrs ago dam
---
Well systemically, I imagine it would take one or two player kills to drop to red status, while it would take either a few hundred monster kills or even several hours of none aggression to reset back into neutral or blue status. It's not meant to be a permanent status ranking, just an indicator of how a player has been behaving.
---
What if she is provoking a fighr and angrily calling your name to mark you for death
---
Magazines are my Achilles' heel at the moment.
---
I keep finding #3 over and over. Is like the others have ceased to exist...
---
On the upside I have completed most of the 'world' magazine challenges in the process so that is a pile of atoms I wasn't expecting to get :D
---
Still, I would be lying if I said it didn't feel grindy. It did.
---
But they want you to get so desperate to change that ugly back pack that you’ll spend atoms on something you don’t really want and then buy more when something you do finally appears. This is about money, definitely not player enjoyment.
---
workshops are PVP areas. it is better to just wander around naturally spawning core areas until you are strong enough to survive PVP battles. even at level 270 its still not worth it IMO to take over a workshop for the resources
---
For most players, they behave the same way all the time. You will get slain by blue status ALL THE TIME. Myself being one of them.
---
Yesterday after spending 400 bullets, 5 stimpacks and breaking 2 weapons right at the end all 7 peiple including me crashed right before the end of the event. Whats funny, the game froze, but voice chat was still working and I was able to hear people complain in it that it crashed, so yeah, the event is definetely have some issues with that.
---
Gotta few from the train car west of Watoga Station as well
---
What benefits do you have from “harder to detect” armor in PvP?
---
That’s pretty awesome. Can’t really survive around watoga yet, but I’m curious. Is there a water source for the water purifier? And is it possible to plant a garden in the tunnels?
---
Hey, I hope you don't mind, I got up a little early, so I took the  liberty of milking your cow for you. Yeah, it took a little while to get  her warmed up, she sure is a stubborn one, whew!
---
We don't have a cow, we have a bull...
---
The sneakier, the less vatsable you are while crouched.
---
Right, at which point, those players would drop to red status, thus indicates aggression.
---
When did releasing broken software become become no big deal/expected? They’ve trained you to accept shoddy craftsmanship! And now you even defend their half assed lazy efforts? Smh.
---
No way. The leaderboard can be used by people who want others to come for them. And it's trivial to remove your leaderboard score if you don't want it: Go to your camp, take off chest armour, take off fireproof, shoot ground with exp weapon, loot your bag. Done, you're off the leaderboard. I will say, though, that the first system they had for leaderboard was probably the best, much better than kills, and somewhat better than than the current one. They should also give some non combat advantage to people with the highest score, so it's actually worth keeping, rather than something you just want to draw people to the fighting area.
---
Oh yeah, title belongs on a clickbate YouTube thumbnail. Can't really disagree with any of his points though
---
If you ever go to the imposter sheepsquach  cabin and walk up to the top of hill and crouch the wendigo actually stands up and walks around, and it really does look like that... I didn't realize what it was the first time I seen it I went running up through there seen it walking around immediately crouched and was like wtf is that a new creature pulled out my camera and boom top says wendigo... I never knew they stood up....
---
Why do people even care about a 3* enemy? They’re pretty common in lots of events. And, chances are, when you kill one you’re going to get the exact same crap you’d find on a ghoul in Whitesprings.
---
"It's Dick Shale - Congratulations, Sport - you've been voted today's NUKA COLA MVP! How's that feelin? Any kind regarts to your friends, family or NUKA COLA?"
---
They probably wanted you off the server so a friend could get in a full world
---
Fix the current ones first tho
---
I hit level 95 recently and I finally am at a point where I don't run out of stimpacks.
---
Must be those damn mole rat activists. God do i hate them.
---
my garden is free, help youself!
---
I normally buy it if I see it for less than 10 caps. I use these in crafting to level alts very quickly so I can get through thousands.
---
Ew, no.
---
There's a bonehammer in the player's inventory in the screenshot in Murmgh's inside the vault article, as well as legendary scout armor. Both are confirmed by players. I also recall people reporting having gotten sheep weapons from her too. I've not heard anything on the bear arm unfortunately, but since the rest are obtainable it stands to reason I think.
---
If you find evidence to the contrary, then let me know. I hate to misinform due to being misinformed myself
---
I was crazy surprised the first time when I discovered they have explosive rounds.
---
Now though? Meh. One hit from the gauss / two from the handmade. Keep out their line of sight or better yet range.
---
No, you shouldn't. The game has still many issues and inconviniences, so it will be just a waste of time. Dont return.
---
Depends on if I’m playing on a team. Seems to make it worse. I can definitely go 6 hours without a disconnect or blue screen on ps4 (they do still happen sometimes, just not constantly) on a good day.
---
Yeah, but the creatures will start attacking other creatures and you. And if they do start attacking alpha you're screwed.
---
I'm on xbox but am trying to get the paint set without just buying them  :)
---
So I have to kill myself every so often to remove my score. Ya, that's tasteful gameplay. They can use wanted levels to lure.
---
Friend...you have to be easy on your ol' Betty ya know?
---
Don't squeeze it, it's a Brahmin and not a bottle ketchup.
---
You've made an assumption that the Devs listen to customers.
---
That's why I like the new player vendors. I encountered so many amazing camps, sometimes I do vendor hopping all the time only to look at others houses 😀
---
Must be a large portion of players yet to even see the new event (myself included). Patching the game and adding new content on a Tuesday has always seemed like a strange choice to me.
---
They should not listen to you because you complain about other people that want a different game experience out of fallout. This topic is highly subjective and arguing that Beth is only and always only looking at those who cry the loudest, is the same loud crying you dont like.   
---
Double moral is way more harmful to a community than people just dislike game mechanics.
---
On r/wow they have specific rule for posts "should I play this game?" or "Should I return to the game". The rule is simple - this posts are simply considered spam and get deleted, because they are covered in FAQ.
---
Is it right that you done get a mod in ever scrap? I’m getting a mod in every 5 or 6 scraps
---
Didn’t know about it! Thanks
---
i camp near lewisburg and have never seen it hit, but have spawned in after the red circle is gone. found some flora, and a decent amount of legendaries running around, non glowing.
---
I hadn't played in quite a few months. I recently installed the latest drivers and updated F76. I tried looting the same house twice in a row but kept crashing almost immediately after reaching the second floor.
---
That said,  I don't recall crashing so often even during the early days. Kind of put off from playing it now...
---
No problem!
---
Yeah. Marine is very difficult to unlock the mods for
---
You have no idea how bad would it be if that was changed. The mechanic you want removed is the one you will be using the most when you get to the point where those robots are not extremely dangerous. Its single main thing that allows you to farm efficiently. Cease wanting it, please.
---
If you want great farm, get yourself an appropriate bounty (like 100 or so) and go to location like The Burrows. Each player that enters the location to take your bounty down respawns your monsters giving you these sweet legendaries.
---
That’s not been my experience with it when doing this method
---
I tried this too on a super mutant horde event.
---
Alpha was a 3 star too, tagged him. Then I waited for 20 minutes. Every minute mutants would spawn but no legendarie.
---
Not saying that this don't work because I saw the video too. But maybe fixed?
---
Or a drill grants you 151 scrip.
---
I got 100% on Xbox. Which one doesn't work for you?
---
A tip if you want to place a wall where it don't want to go. Place a wall next to it. Put a roof on the wall. Extend the roof in the direction you want the new wall. Put the wall onto the roof. This also works well to clip a foundation to a floor. Usually using door frames are best when doing this kind of stuff as it allows for more thingst to be done.
---
Inner walls that for brick will be white on both sides. Put down a door frame. Then you can put another doorframe or even solid wall next to it turned the other way. Select the first wall and press the first store button but then the modify or whatever. On PC it's R - T - choose new wall - E.
---
So basically its under heavy weapons but is not an heavy weapon....
---
Great was just thinking of getting one for my heavy weapons build. 
---
Build be nice to have a second not too bulky weapon to use as a side.
---
Because the comment I am replying to was talking generally, and I thought it would add to the conversation about which bugs get priority. Why did you reply?
---
Just removed the damn things from the game completely if they’re not supposed to be there. But they won’t. 
---
This game isn’t about balance or anything else except trying to squeeze atoms out of your wallet. And I say that as someone who does enjoy most of what the game is. But they DO NOT care about the details.
---
If you’re Xbox and on sometime today I can give you some free ones.
---
Besides sbq what else is a bullet sponge? I find most enemies squishy. Like I one hit them
---
&gt; **Bullet sponges are NOT A MECHANIC** 
---
People complain a lot about (omg this person just one shoted the &gt;insert mob here&lt;) which is why they probably added this
---
&gt; **Friendlies were NOT designed to survive an alpha**  
---
I don't think you mention it but this is itself a mechanic in the event. Put more in the feeder, better friendly comes out and makes them much easier to defend. 
---
&gt; **2. Enemy Respawns,**  **3. Stage 1: Horrible spawns and respawns** 
---
You contradict yourself in these two. First you complain about constant mobs, then you complain about there being not enough mobs. You also mention that you weren't able to get enough for a feeder. I myself fed a feeder all the way up to rank two. This was by myself. It really is simple to at least get a rank 2 on a feeder. And even easier with multiple people. Yes, getting all the animals to a high rank is good. But just getting at least 1 to rank 2 is enough. 
---
&gt; **5c. Do not split players attention by splitting objectives AND splitting rewards** 
---
Like you said before the last mob is a bullet sponge. there is no reason why you can't spare a couple bullets while standing next to the friendly.
---
ffs
---
Well that's sort of like where I like my camp where it is lol.
---
Theres still a lot of scorched, rats and liberator spawns, but at highest level 10 my Heavy Turrets take care of them easily so I never have to worry about anything passing the line.
---
Plus I like having a pet around for mobile support :) Only problem is it keeps dying in a bug when I cant place the camp and have to go to another world :(
---
This is a terrible idea, and if you are not okay with having your own gear randomly removed because somebody else doesn't like it, then you can't demand anybody else gear to be removed. 
---
Blah blah duping blah - irrelevant. Not all legacy guns are duped. I have at least one unique one myself.
---
whats your gt? if on xbox i would sell you some super cheap. but yes workshops work this way so others can use them, otherwise someone could claim them and never let other players use them.
---
just like how the Gauss rifle uses energy ammo but does ballistic damage
---
I have to say that this Community is amazing in terms of support, I've had so many awesome players come up and drop plans, weapons, water, etc. for me out of the blue. I can't wait till I'm at a higher level and I can help people the same way. 
---
It kind of makes sense! We were all in a vault together for 25 years! We should have each other's backs!
---
And even then AA depends of the build. I was all wet when I found an AA FFR LMG for my non PA bloodied build. Turns out it deals LESS dmg than my plain old bloodied lmg, period, because of how bloodied build scales.
---
Now I wonder how well préforms a bloodied weapon against a junkie one in a bloodied build.
---
Dude they don’t listen! Hah! They just pretend they do when they make a change that is in line with current complaints. Get real.
---
When you hear me singing along to the radio (as I have done when I forget it's not a solo game anymore) you will add that to the toxic behaviour.
---
Yes, gimping my character because someone else might be around is difficult for you.  The problem isn't mine to solve - get the developers to fix the fucking broken combat and experience/loot mechanics.  Asking other players to do something and then hoping they remember to do it even if they agree to it is not going to happen.  You're wasting your time.  Nobody is going to gimp themselves to help random internet strangers get loot.
---
We might be talking about different things actually. I meant the in-game challenges, you probably about xbox achievements, right?
---
Haha np mate. I'll hit you up when I'm home 👍
---
Ad3. I am heavily invested into survival, I think its awesome and lots of fun if played smartly. As a player thats usually in the leaderboards without exping, I find the common thesis that you need assassin-sentinel to be able to fight as completely false.
---
That was the preface, the point is I ignore repair kits completely yet I don't feel like I'm loosing on anything because I do so.
---
This is the greatest thing ever
---
Not really. Hes just saying listen to the people who actually like the game.
---
I am 44 years old and i play games since Lemmings on Amiga, i gotta say this is quite obvious yet it had slipped me too. 
---
I guess i could try this if i will re install the game sometimes in the future...
---
I would also like to opt into other alerts for events.
---
Last night i was researching how to get the raider under armour plans for the last 2 tiers. Ends up i aparently have to do savage divide events like uranium feaver and the music one in the compound. 
---
So if i could set that in my terminal, id be a happy camper
---
People don't understand how damage works.  Or what armor pen does.  Or why perks like Adamantium Skeleton are fucking stupid and pointless.  Or tons of other examples of dumb shit people do because that's what they think is good, or that's what they did in (insert irrelevant comparison here).
---
If most of these people stopped, read the perk cards, and actually went and spent fifteen minutes testing basic shit on enemies so they could see a difference, they'd have significantly more powerful characters that they wouldn't need to bitch to internet strangers about.
---
This is what gaming's become though.  95% lost, unhappy, crybabies that can't bother to learn or try anything on their own.  If its not spelled out for them in the game or in a guide that goes viral, they are incapable of grasping it.
---
The lord helps those who help themselves.  You will not enjoy a game less because you understand it more.  No one is saying you need to run the most OP bullshit.  What I am saying is things take a long time to die for only one reason - lots of useless characters doing nearly zero damage is the reason bosses take more than thirty seconds in this game.
---
There is another variant of the automatic reciever I think. Also prime reciever.
---
Alternatively if we had more than 5 min to fill the feeders it would make the event more manageable for a smaller player participation. 15 mins would give you five min per area allowing even a solo player to at least get a bit in each hopper.
---
Oh ok, thought it was just me.
---
This happened to me too.
---
PC
---
I have a ton of them on xbox.
---
Ive got a bloodied explosive -90% weight. 45 subgun and it weighs 12 pounds.
---
"Atoms now have a half-life of 1 week"
---
A nice sidearm is a plasma rifle with flamer mod. It realy melts anything (like glowing snallies or yuo gi-s in the new event). Its close-mid range.
---
When you made the post 3 hrs ago was a good time for me. Sucks my phone wasn't on. But if I'm awake I will pop on tonight.
---
No worries man. If not, I'll hop on again tomorrow before work :)
---
This. It's the only real solution. At the moment there are stores I will not visit because they're close to the edge of the map, or simply in the middle of nowhere. It's a shame, as I'm likely missing out on some good purchases and potentially seeing some nicely crafted camps. 
---
That said, if we all have that mindset then perhaps it's worth the travel fee, as those stores are less likely to have been plundered? I'm really struggling go find things to buy at stores. Good weapons don't hang around very long!
---
Sweet that might be better. Next time I will keep my phone on lol
---
I'm going to assume you're on PC?
---
It was a bug. They have since fixed the bug: "Repair: Repairing an item beyond 100% Condition no longer incorrectly provides an increase to some stats."
---
Two of us participated last night and we got one trough to level 3, this is putting all your eggs in one basket but we got the deathclaw, unfortunately a lack of participation meant we couldn’t kill the Sheepsquatch before it’s quill attacks with the lesser mobs were able to overthrow him. Can’t really see timing as an issue, more the lack of participation and the event vultures who just turn up, watch, tag the legendary creature once and then get upset when the event fails.
---
A lack of participation and a lack of notification motivated me to make this thread. Hopefully it will gain enough attention so Bethesda implement a simple yet effective way of notifying us of events as Todd said they thought events were going to be the big thing, and they could well be...
---
The bosses in project paradise are pretty spongey for the average player. Also higher level super mutants are spongey.
---
I've also lived through all my friends, and some family, trying to tell me it's a "terrible game with nothing to offer" but I ignored them and have be playing, and having rather a lot of fun, since the beta.
---
It is totally frustrating. Even if the areas are “supposed to be pvp” it’s stupid- they’re the only place you can build beside you’re super limited camp- and the Only people who ever contest a workshop are tse addicted people looking to show off and make your life miserable. 
---
I had a group destroy my last workshop simply for the sake of it and post a sign saying “raiders were here”. 
---
“That’s kind of cool role playing,” says my more casual teammate as I explain the encounter. “You got hit by a raider gang.”
---
But it’s not cool, I told him, because it left me absolutely no recourse for revenge or satisfaction. If they were npc raiders, then maybe I could track them to their leaders base, finally kill them, maybe get a reward. 
---
What could I do here? Fast travel to the op player with the extremely broken and overused Exploding effect on their handmade or shotgun? Then what? Initiate combat when the second slap gets all the initiative?
---
Bethesda did no forward thinking and no testing with pvp in this game. They just dumped it on us and said Have fun. It’s only fun for guy buying their gear from online sources. Not the actual people who play the game (huge air quotes) “as intended”. 
---
And I swear to god.... Bethesda left duping in the game on purpose, and they still drop updates that bring it back, but only till the next hotfix, check social media and dupe while you can!
---
Ffs this game 😒
---
The issue is (PC at least). 
---
If you are in a team at the main menu (either from setting up team there, or still being in same team from crash or quit), then when you join the teams server you will not see any teammates in the bottom left team list, and your teammates will not see you.
---
Voice will also not work between the affected members.
---
Yet the social menu still thinks you are in the team.
---
A work around is to quit, or be kicked from the team (either at main menu or in game) and must be invited back to the team in-game.
---
I think this started with Patch 9, and has continued in Patch 9.5
---
Another longer running issue is sometimes a friends status will be set to (Main Menu). In this state they cannot be invited to team or fast traveled to.
---
A workaround is to quit and restart the game.
---
I run stealth and VATS. Max agi.
---
I swap action boy (2star) for mr sandman at night. 
---
Max covert ops. Max sneak and 4 in adrenaline and max gun fu. If doing a bullet sponge then I'd swap out gun fu and adrenaline for action boy,  evasive, and the lower ap when running one. 
---
dropped escape artist as I didn't see any benefits. Maybe cos of the chameleon armour?!
---
Also run with mutations. Eagle eyes. Speed demon. Marsupial. Scaly skin. are best for me.
---
1st. That game mode would be even more empty than survival. 
---
2nd. Data miners already found info suggesting that at least part of it is gonna be some dumb ass battle royal shit.
---
Yes. Guess is energy weapon.
---
Same thing with the Tesla rifle at Camp Adams. Thankfully the loot is all low grade so I don't feel too bad about the dozens of glitchy ash piles...
---
I said besides paradise boss and it's supposed to be more difficult. I one hit max level super mutants. You might be one of those people they are talking about, only picking perks that help in your imagination my friend. It's all about your build. Might want to read those perk cards
---
Meanwhile I literally get pissed off going to my camp every time because it's so confusing and I need to fix it but honestly I just want to move it but the player vendors won't remember all 90 of the things in them if I do that so I'm stuck with this shitty annoying maze of a camp. I wish they could just remember!!
---
Oh damn. Must have overread that.
---
When taking a power plant dont even bother building the place up. Just power the fusion generator and nothing else because turrets wont help at all if someone wants the place.
---
With the proper perks vats becomes super good. I use rifles and with 3 concentrated fire, 1 gun fu, and adrenaline its just silly. 
---
Just got a handmade with reduced vats cost, made it auto... i can literally stay in vats for as long as there is an enemy in front of me. Hold that space bar for crits too.
---
I'm getting over 1,400 a hit with the right combo of drugs, booze, adrenaline, and wasteland cuisines. I've researched by build. Not everyone has the time on their hands to go through all that hassle and be elite like you
---
yup
---
Your character looks like a Fortnite character.
---
If you tag a legendary enemy with even 1 bullet you get the loot.
---
You propose removing a useful mechanic people use in their play, the leaderboard, to be replaced with a more difficult one, getting a wanted level. Yet complain about the easier to use trick to play the way you wish. This isn't reasonable. You only really need to be clearing your score if you're just there for pve and there's pvpers (people with kills) there clearing their score, or are new to the map. Otherwise you know when pvpers are coming for you because their number is near yours. Still, the first leaderboard scoring method was better for people who were there for pve, because they could go about their business for 30-45 or so minutes before they were forced into the action.
---
They may be pvp areas but they’re also the only place you can build anything to enjoy the Camp system after you have yours set. And it’s an entirely pointless endeavor and a wasted opportunity to actually make something interesting out of workshops.
---
Apology not accepted.
---
I have the exact opposite experience. I have al the fire power to destroy all in my path even the lvl 100 alpha dies without taking two steps.  But I can’t fill the feeders enough to get anything other than a weak ass bloat fly. That gets one shot from across the biome from a snallygaster sneeze. If I had more time to fill up the feeder I’d stand a decent chance. Also al longer feeder fill timer would allow for more players to join in. As it stands once you activate the terminal you have 5 minutes. By the time the server wide announcement goes off and players would join the timer would already be gone. Leaving you with weak ass bugs to defend.
---
I still use the same brush I had on day 1... it's had 3 new handles and 4 new heads... I should get a medal.
---
Um never said I was elite and your the one who said high level super mutants are spongey pal. I would love to see your 1400 dmg build that you then call super mutants spongey lmfao
---
Just out of curiosity, what was the marking the raiders left?
---
Thiiiiis. I think this is half of the problem with those whiny "Raiders" who come in here to cry about how BGS is trying to make the game not fun for PVP anymore (although they usually have SOME good points, they have this problem where they think the game is only for them)
---
Tbh dude the reception of the post speaks for itself, if you dont like it 1v1 me ;p
---
The mode will die off pretty quick either way
---
Problem is, due to any kind of greenhouse or planter system, crops look ridiculous indoors when you’ve torn away some of the floor just to get to earth. Then you’ve got to take the roof off because how are they growing without sun.
---
This is the solution. I don't want to keep purposely using weak weapons and not using crits because of other players. It makes it really hard to play with others.
---
So what if you do- the weapon can’t be found, wasn’t supposed to exist, and is broken in its current state. It’s not a “legacy” anything, it’s a broken item they won’t remove because they don’t really care. Enjoy using your “it’s not supposed to be in the game” weapon.
---
I understand why the OP asks, the Gauss is a bit special, it uses energy to propel a ballistic bulet...
---
Getting into power armour in time is a lottery. I've been killed waiting for the bloody thing to appear
---
Point is, weight points in-game doesn't have any direct correlation to real-life weight anymore, unlike Fallout 4.
---
What does a duper require scrip for?
---
2k.
---
The problem is that the floors are made to be tileable at the full size. This makes adding textures to the stairs with floor possible but the pattern would be fixed and you would have to adapt to that. I would still love this.
---
With the smaller parts it's harder.
---
If we start by looking at the 1x1 it would have to be four different parts of the texture to be able to make it fit together next to a full size floor/foundation. Then you wouldn't be able to put another full size next to it on the other side as it would break up the pattern. These are small problems for me andI would be fully content with a singe pattern that would not be perfect but much better than what we have today.
---
This is even more problematic on the 2x1 as it could not only be placed in different directions but also at the corner of a full size floor and span over the ajoining floor.
---
All this would make some patterns very problematic (looking at that Whitesprings green flowers pattern) but less so with others. I would think that some would be ok with two versions on them (like the Vault-tec squares that could have a yellow square and a blue/white one), while others would be good enough (like the wood floors might not fit perfectly when tileing but it'd be better than the mesh), and still other just would not work.
---
Combine this with making stairs snap to the small squares and half width walls and I'm all in regardless.
---
So people can turn it off when they're at the caps cap.
---
so basically Fortnite but its gonna die 2 inches from the gate.
---
2 inches is 5.08 cm
---
I am so over legendary effects. I would kill for a server with no legendaries at all. I don’t care about the details, the perks are enough, legendaries are completely unbalanceable and we’re meant for single player only.
---
Many thanks - I do sometimes wonder about the benefits of Escape Artist myself. I think I'm going to work towards the Max Adrenaline as with Sandman, Covert Ops and Gun Fu, that sounds like it's just going to annihilate small groups of mobs :)
---
I've been playing computer games since '82, and even earned Comp-Sci degree with dreams of making my own games.  I've also been to the game developers conference a handful of times.
---
I can tell you with 100% confidence that no developer has the time to read message forums.
---
 Also, they have their own ideas about what to do with their game, they really do not need, or want, input.
---
The only time developers "listen" and reply to the gamer community is when there is a P.R. nightmare needing to be addressed.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
I literally never use that and never have any problem 1 or 2 hitting any glowing enemy with almost any of my weapons.
---
I'm going to call shenanigans on you.
---
I run around with a Bloodied mole miner gauntlet and 4/5 Unyielding. I can regularly get up to over 800 damage per swing and it still takes two swings to take down level 60+ super mutants.
---
If you regularly get 1000+ damage per attack in order to one shot these super mutants you are *not* anywhere near the average player.
---
Rose can do the late shift
---
What's 999999999999999999999999999991 inches in cm?
---
Its a bug that was fixed in 9.5
---
Apparel: Fixed an issue in which some Apparel items were incorrectly providing +1 Damage Resistance when equipped.
---
Sprint have AP and swing that supposed gauntlet of yours one hit. I use deathclaw gaunt. Usually only one or two 68 mutants in a pack rest 48 one hit like normal my goodness. Not hard people
---
I disagree with every fibre in my being. I think I should get the money back I spent traveling to these garbage cans people are calling a shop. I dont want people filling up their vender with even more trash to trick me into coming just so that they can get free caps.
---
It's called Fort Defiance. The box is straigh in front  of the elevator.
---
How can it be the same *bloody* broom then?!?
---
PVE servers.
---
Fast travel to white springs resort. Dont move. Look to your one o'clock. Red corvega spawns him on the bonnet. Not there? Server hop.
---
Simply trying to point out how stupid it was that guy said he has a 1400 dmg build and super mutants are spongey......
---
Yes, I'm talking about achievements on Xbox, Ps4 and PC. Not challenges.
---
Great post.
---
I tried the event went into the dungeon game crashed tried a few times. I gave up haven't gone back.
---
I like the idea of tokens like pioneers.
---
I hate random loot systems I'd rather grind the event earn the currency and purchase the rewards I want.
---
Already so much in this game that's hidden behind random chance and pure luck to get. I just want to be able to earn everything.
---
The thing I don't like about the pioneer dailies and event is however its random chance to get a badge.
---
I had a base at that location, i moved though. It was super hard to build in, how did you make it so good?
---
(Also colored lights? How?!?)
---
Forgot about BIV. Yes please.
---
Also with bloodied and radicool melee you can one hit most things. But shenanigans right?
---
Do a hard reset on your Xbox. I’ve had this occur multiple times and the hard reset fixes it.
---
Nap20000, you bastard! Lmao! This is Tiamat_Leo and you Blackwater Bandits completely destroyed my acid operation at Hemlock Holes! ;D
---
I glitched into my foundation on respawn and died needlessly several times. 
---
When it was over I wasn’t sure if I hated you or wanted to join. At least I got ONE hit on you as you snuck up from behind before you annihilated my base.
---
I really hope so i dont want to get killed by some lvl 400 with some insane legendary 
---
Every one should make a new character and the rewards get saved idk
---
It is broken, but if you attach a flat roof piece to the half wall then try adding the second half wall piece on top it will let you. Then just remove the roof piece.
---
Leaked challenges lean toward not having any of you stuff because for one of the challenges you gotta find power armor and win with it
---
i haven't tried rifleman \*dont have those perks\* but commando does on the automatic receiver... good luck controlling it though  i cant even keep all 10 spikes on a grounded sb \*yes it kicks THAT bad\* but damn is it super fun
---
Damn that lighting is crazy
---
Stop ruining my dreams
---
Its hard to tell who is a new player and who just made an alt or if its a mule character from the minimap alone.
---
Generally i have to observe them for a few minutes first :) usually batman style from a rooftop.
---
After new player confirmation im happy to get some things from the stash. Ammo, stimpacks, canned dog food (for those with good doggy perk which is not bad at the start of the game), some water that always accumilates in my inventory.
---
I also have blood packs in my stash as they weigh less than stimpacks, so its easy to craft a few for new players if i sold all of them beforehand.
---
What platform are you on? I’m always giving my extra cores away
---
What I love about this post is how well thought out, explained, and worst of all, how true it is. There's also the unfortunate part where Xbox players are, for the most part, unable to do the event. I witnessed last night a bunch of people at Arktos on my server, the event up, but a LOT of the people (including myself) kept suddenly leaving due to the game crashing/freezing. Not enough people care for it on Xbox due to this, from my experience. Thank you for posting this!
---
If you are on pc I'll be happy to help you out with some fusion cores or workshop taking. PM me your in game name :)
---
True enough but the current system just allows for the person with the best pvp build to hold them and never let other players use them. I don't know if that is much a better option than just locking you into a 30 min slot and kicking you off for a 2-hour cooldown per each individual workshop, at least for adventure mode. Survival is another matter entirely and you should be able to have your stuff taken a  moments notice even if you have the best gear.
---
Yup. I've [posted about how it's messed with upper floor and staircase placement as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brnheg/what_on_earth_did_this_patch_do_to_camp_building/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app). Hopefully they fix these soon because camp building is the main thing I do in this game.
---
Can confirm, have been through this exact same process on ps4, but a way to fix it for us has been to have everyone leave team, one person restarts the invite chain and then we go again as normal. I personally keep having an issue where my voice chat won't switch from area to team if im on Auto, and my Chat slider is always all the way left whenever I join a world for the first time on a given day.
---
You can always use the bloatfly syringer to spawn one in its super handy for challenges and most times for me it’s glowing as well.
---
What many people don't seem to fully realize is that Bethesda's business model for Fallout 76 has been, from the moment of its conception, to be a "games as a service" type of game... which means that instead of selling a complete and polished game on release (and maybe offering a patch or two in order to fix various oversights and errors and a bunch of bigger, paid DLCs) they would continually support and improve the game. 
---
And that's the crux of the matter: Continuous support and improvements. [Well, where are they?](https://giphy.com/gifs/quentin-tarantino-pulp-fiction-vincent-vega-3o7aTskHEUdgCQAXde) Why are they taking so long? Why do many changes and additions seem so thoughtless, lackluster and out of touch with the playerbase? Bethesda needs to get their act together in order for the game to work - to WORK. It's NOT "entitled" or pretentious of us to ask for improvements and necessary alterations of current mechanics. Bethesda has stated on many occasions that they're actively seeking player feedback. In fact they are depending on players giving feedback. 
---
People getting bitchy and angry in their requests is a clear sign that they CARE... that those who are still playing want this game to improve and succeed. That they are willing to give it a chance and are willing to spend a lot of time within the game. But many of us are on the verge of finally turning our backs on 76. Raising our voices is our last and most desperate effort to be heard. Because kindly asking for change has had zero effect in the past. #FridaysForFuture
---
At least you got a laugh out of it right?  I never imagined one of the ones we hit and tagged would be a redditor, but was deep down hoping to see a picture of one of our tags with the caption "who the hell are these guys?"
---
Yeah I get that's how it's supposed to work. But tell me where my ammo went if not into the queen from a foot away
---
Probably will check it out later, thanks for the help
---
[https://imgur.com/a/RaYbOPe](https://imgur.com/a/RaYbOPe) 
---
Yeah, supposed.
---
As I said, you are *not* anywhere near the average player. And frankly, neither am I. Bullet sponginess is a real thing, and just because you or I don't have a hard time with some of the more extreme examples, doesn't mean that the rest of the playerbase isn't dumping magazine after magazine into these things.
---
Agree sorting by value helps bring most things up to the top
---
good ideas. i haven't seen many workshops claimed lately. i'd suggest taking one putting up minimum like extractors, and if someone over powered comes to take it, server hop. not ideal i know, but a work around. personally i like helping people defend them, then i run off with a thumbs up, lol.
---
kinda looks like a porn set
---
Sometimes with Special guests, Grahm and Chally the MooMoo, the Insult Bot, and any other notable NPC in the game
---
Death doesn't scare you enough ? Then make up your own rules. You die in game, you cut off a finger !
---
Sadly that won't be possible, I don't play on console. I'd definitely support the top pvpers being able to dictate survival mechanics, however. If the winners of a few 1v1s could decide on changes rather than those who complain the loudest on reddit and other forums, we would be in a better place. Too many recent changes to the game seem to have been made on the advice by people who never pvp, or at least aren't even close high level play.
---
I am a stealth sniper and have a maxed glowing sights perk card... iam trying to see what difference it makes to my build. 
---
I have max per and run all 3 max rifle. Tank killer and concentrated fire.
---
I run vats so the only swap out for me is one of the rifleman... ignoring some armour and headshotting from the other perks are a must... 
---
Do on paper i am giving up +20% rifle damage to get +60% damage to glowing enemies... base damage 100... 120 with rifleman or 160 against the glowing
---
Does it work that way real world? Seems to when I did uranium full of glowing miners...
---
I will be doing more tests tonight... :)
---
100% agree to the OP.
---
To all the "NO, dont nerf anything" guys. 
---
They will buff and nerf stuff in this game until the servers shut down. Its a competitive multiplayer game. It needs to be fair to be fun.
---
If you dont do PvP, then I understand you guys, in PvE it doesnt matter if one player on the server has a broken weapon. If the player is nice, its even an advantage if theres a player with such a weapon.
---
But in PvP, this one player destroys the fun for all the others. This one player with the BE Laser Rifle is like a cheater for the other players. A friend gave me such a gun to test it. Its simply unfair. Its broken. It needs to be fixed, I for one stop playing survival until this is fixed and kill you PvErs with my overpowered gear in your workshops. ;-)
---
BTW: Another thing. Each and everyone of us hates pay to win. People even cry about those lousy repair kits... with this gun, this game already is in pay2win mode. It cant drop anymore, but there are websites and channels out there where you can buy a duped version for 30 euro.
---
And if you have say 3 scrip left available, then you should be able to scrap a higher value item if you want! The extra you lose can go wherever the 10% from vending machines goes to...
---
excellent timing
---
So since we both read our perk cards build right and some don't. Bethesda should Nerf stuff to make it easy for lazy people who won't spend time to learn a game and actually play it. No they just come to Reddit and cry that things are to hard. These are the people who show up to events add nothing to the completion of said event then cry it was to hard. I want more difficult content makes the game fun. It's not fun running around destroying everything you come across with ease.
---
Yeah I tested mine VE weapon I think its tripple bugged as V doesn't seem to do anything and hell the game is still on easy mode. I switched back to my good old bloodied V50 combat rifle to make it more competetive.
---
Yes, let's rock up to Todd's house waving rifles, what could go wrong!
---
Bethesda's design style. They don't think any further how things work. Bethesda has proved numerous of times they can't create any games with decent quality.
---
I've come across this mod at vendors twice in near 2000 hours lol. I'm not sure if it can be learned through scrapping though?
---
Actually, there’s not a single oversight in this plan!
---
I'd love if they gave us hardcore survival mode with one separate character (no mules, no exiting hardcore with that character), full loot drop and no legendary items besides named quest rewards, so that legendary items would be, you know, legendary.
---
i love how bethesda fixes something that can potentially make them lose money in couple of days, while these bugs are in game since beta
---
ah thank you I'll try doing that!
---
So you want everything to die in 1 hit? That does not sound like fun....
---
Sneak up to it and as soon as you get the prompt milk that sucker to death!!!
---
Since the possums challenge they only drop one in five times... I used to get milk from my camp brahmin every time.
---
Keep down voting it proves my rightness and that you crybaby losers don't have any business playing this game lol. Like I fucking care about Reddit. Only joined to post about fallout. Keep it up winners 💪

Are youa shortsighted hypocrite that only cares about self-proclaimed sense of righteousness? If you don't write "I'm okay with my stuff being randomly removed because somebody else doesn't like it" as a response to this, that's the end of our discussion and I'll leave it comsidering you a whiny egoist whose opinion on this games balance or any sense of justice is irrelevant.
---
do you have the Plague Walker mutation? you might be hurting the brahmin with it whenever you're getting close...
---
I would love this, cause right now that's the biggest thing that is turning me off from using the vending machines. I've gotten rid of mine cause it seems that, even by putting the stuff that was in my box already into my vending machines, it just adds extra weight, and suddenly my stash is full. Meaning, I can have 650 pounds worth of stuff in my stash box, but once I move any clothes or weapons over to my vending machine, all of a sudden I'm maxed out on space and can't place anything else for sale.
---
For the people who are saying it's a bad idea because people can just price the stuff they want to keep to 25k: those people can also put the vending machines, off, behind a locked door inside their camp. Either they need to separate the stash space, or make the stash box space to 1000 from the 800 we have right now.
---
3rd!!!
---
Are you serious or just oblivious? I see people every day, decent people you know who care about others. It's called empathy i think.
---
I'm saying people who don't have the hours to spend planning and making that build may find these things spongey. People who have families and real world stuff. I have the time to spare so put more time into this which makes me able to deal out more damage by planning by build
---
But I dont have a Plague
---
Yes please! I don't even know what I'm buying. I've never brought a single plan for this reason.
---
there is lots of razorgrain and corn out at the billings/silva farmstead or you can come and take mine that's what it's there for
---
do you have a disease?
---
Get stronger friends is all I can say, if someone contests mine I kill them till they leave and then level their base. I just don’t tolerate it. Once they figure out they can’t win they either leave or get prideful and it’s a win win for me I either get rich or carry on. I know you’re a low level but sometimes it’s better to know when to call quits then to keep going and lose everything
---
Yeah I'm definitely making an appearance if this is PC?
---
what platform is this?
---
Well I PVP everyday and am more than capable of fighting ANY player. I have difficulties with stealthboy+tesla turds but thats about it. And yet I still believe this is the proper route for the server and the route that will keep it going the longest. I don't care about dominating. I'm competitive but still want every kind of player to have fun. Survival isn't all about apex players and crybabies.
---
As far as I know explosive gauss rifles still drop. yes.
---
Ok so when your playing instead of grinding one day plan your build.. don't make stupid excuses. If you have any time to play at all you have 30 minutes to read a bunch of perk cards, they even have spreadsheets online I think to make it easier for lazy people!!
---
I did now, and I’m not as salty as it likely comes across over reddit. That’s why the place was such a mess, I was supposed to be expecting someone to attack. Of course, I got distracted, caught off guard etc but your attack had me way over powered. It was a solid lesson in trying to find a way to counter being in such a weak position as the workshop owner. 
---
I used contractor and mostly just the base building materials, fences are 1 wood apiece. Yeah, I had a hard time gaging if it was a pain for you or not, it proved hard for me to use my own grenades. 
---
Anyway, totally memorable experience, especially coming back to the aftermath. 
---
How much did it cost for you to challenge? Is 100 the max amount? That’s what it showed me when I came back. I’ll have to modify my “make it expensive so attack is unappealing” strategy if that’s all.
---
If they lock the elevator  how am I meant to get back in when I die and glitch out resulting in me having to spawn back outside
---
Lol "hours" . You clearly have never played a real rpg
---
Rad it forward.
---
It is wonderful that you have figured out where the spawn point is.  I am not sure how that means it is impossible for bethesda to be concerned that giving us spawn mats would increase griefing.    You say it is easy to determine, but most people either haven't or are very clumsy griefers.
---
PSA run into their crops if you see them render.  I don't think I've ever gotten trapped in crops.
---
Question- is the spawn point for you and others different?  I spawn NE of the middle of my camp, but others who visit me tend to spawn NW.
---
Let people already in the event respawn in the interior cell instead?
---
Is not like this doesn't make logical sense and is not achievable from a technical standpoint.
---
The important when was, did you manage to find her?
---
Really? i've found them more often near the confederate memorial thing
---
Haven't tried those.  The tesla is a fun gun with lots of visuals.
---
This make me smile. Have a great day!
---
Didnt work for me.
---
I would love items from NV but I’m not sure if it would make sense lore-wise. Has the NCR even formed yet?
---
I think weapon weights are fine. Mod weights are not fine. Modding a weapon shouldn’t make it weight 2.5 times what it normally did.
---
There is a word for gamers like you, it's called a minmaxer, not everyone enjoys minmaxing, it would be boring if everyone had the same build, alot of people like diversity. Why is it a bad thing, if people want to have more RP style builds but can't because they get rekt by most things then there is something wrong.
---
I considered this a while back, but never checked to see, but as the quest clearly says you need to kill the Boss to stop the horde, it makes sense to keep the Boss alive and farm it a little, assuming the rewards are worth it, which might depend on which horde and the location.
---
Ancient windego a variant of the wendigo that wears a deer skull and fur over its sholders is 1.5 times bigger and walks upright

---
I think it was 100, or close to it.  It made moving about inside annoying, which is why I went through and scrapped a lot of it, but that was just too tedious. Can't imagine the time spent putting all of it there. 
---
Perhaps try stacked mats. If you have tons of disposable cloth, rugs stack on top of each other in a neat little pile. I would guess they add enough to the budget to raise the claim cost and could be hidden well and can't be destroyed.
---
Nope. This would serve as a easter egg. But they added a dragons to this game, so who cares ... :D
---
right..a lot of disagreement on this subject.
---
I made a post about this a while back - Like you I Know many folks including myself who would love to play survival mode if it was a proper survival mode....
---
I’d like to offer some feedback on your new survival mode as a veteran of online PVP survival games including Fallout 4’s survival mode.
---
While I can’t speak for everyone, I can speak from 1000+ hours experience in many of the top PVP survival games and on behalf of a large survival game community I play with as we have discussed what we would really like to see it transform into as it exits beta. I know a lot of people who are interested in purchasing the game but are waiting to see if this turns into a proper survival mode.
---
I was very excited when this mode first got announced as I was expecting a more brutal, spiced up version of the current adventure mode. While Adventure is a lot of fun it is currently very easy with no real consequences to game play.
---
My suggestions for a true survival mode experience;
---
• Absolutely no markers whatsoever for players on the map. Putting a bounty on a players head could be an option but it should be done at a vendor and cost a lot. The problem with the current scoreboard system / map marking system is that it is a distraction from the core game play. The reason PvP is so tense in survival games is because the encounters are random and unpredictable. While I'm not opposed to a stats board, marking players on the map for doing well has just put me off playing survival entirely. The markers are an artificial construct and a distraction from the core gameplay. There’s nothing to fear in terms of players finding each other organically. I never use the map markers to find players and I bump into them all the time because players go to farm the same locations and events.
---
• Survival mode should require a new character and they should be bound to this mode. Allowing free migration between modes completely defeats the purpose of its existence other than to reinforce the idea that it serves as nothing more than a quick fire death match mode. I'm all for character story and quest progress getting saved across characters but but when you start in survival you are a level 1 character with nothing, otherwise what's the point?
---
• Remove the marking system for when a player has their weapon away or not. Let the players organically decide who's friend and who's foe. It also makes it impossible to hide in foilage or in cover nearby when you've got a big arrow pointing at you.
---
• Buff environmental hazards to make them more dangerous. (rads for example should be lethal)
---
• Make the weather more extreme with more brutal rain storms and frequent rad storms.
---
• Lock character builds to make them permanent. No more jack of all trades, if you want players to engage in more team work then give them a reason to. If you have players who have focused builds that can't be changed then you will see actual builds form resulting in more interaction and trade. Re-rolling could be an option but it should be extremely costly to do it and only available end-game, not something anyone can do constantly or it just defeats the purpose.
---
• Revisit the damage and health system to make them feel like they have an impact on game play. Head shots should be lethal and a broken leg should take a long time to heal without the proper treatment. injuries should have real consequences both visually and practically. Right now they add nothing more than tedious searching through a long list to find the meds in order to get rid of notifications on screen.
---
• Revise the hunger / thirst system to make it actually important and not just another tedious thing in the background. If the bars go empty your character should die. As they get low you should 'feel' the impact through character movement and visuals.
---
• Strip back the HUD, keep it as minimal as possible with as little distraction as possible. No crosshair or first person player markers. The only way to get any sort of UI handicaps is through attachments for weapons and armour pieces. Quests should have minimal info and require the player to explore properly without their hand being held.
---
• Buff enemies to be more lethal. Non-boss enemies should be less bullet sponge but deal more damage.
---
• Reduce the accuracy and increase the recoil of all weapons to make combat last longer, especially in PVP. Also reduce NPC accuracy to balance their increase in difficulty and increased weapon damage output.
---
• Negate server hopping significantly by only allowing it to occur once every hour. If you leave a server and boot back up the game in less than an hour then it should put you back on the same server. The game is pretty much built around server hopping right now as that's what pretty much everybody is doing to farm end-game. The result is access to endless resources and a broken economy. Something needs to be done to make it unappealing or stop it entirely and at the same time, make players want to stay where they are. If server hopping gets fixed this would have a huge impact on game play and like locking character builds, it would encourage a lot more team play and trade as a proper loot economy would form where things are in demand. Server hopping the vast majority are doing constantly to farm and that just seems bizarre to me that we spend so much time going to the main menu to jump servers every couple of minutes.
---
• The loot economy should be revised to make some things a lot more scarce. Currently if you know the map you can so easily get everything you need. Meds in particular are far too easy to come by. If server hopping is negated and loot is scarce then proper trade will form as there will be supply and demand.
---
• Player versus player combat needs a lot of attention. The gap between god tier and new player weapons and armour needs closing significantly. Now I'm not opposed to legendary items but in survival mode the effects need to be nerfed significantly so that they only provide a very small advantage. Either that or the legendary effects should only effect PVE targets. When in PVP, the legendary effects should do nothing. If PVP is to be fair in the long rung then a new player with a pipe pistol should at least have a chance against a player in full assassins combat armour. In a PvP encounter the main factor that should determine the winner should be wit and skill otherwise there will be no long term life for survival servers if new players don't have a chance.
---
• Feeding from my last point, power armour should be the god tier outfit that is damn hard to take down by anybody. In order to balance, PA should be a much rarer sight. Fusion cores should be extremely rare, drain faster and PA should cost a heck of a lot to maintain. Manoeuvrability could be nerfed significantly to give other players a fighting chance or at least the ability to escape. This would mean folks wouldn't be roaming in it all the time. It would be saved for proper use during events like nuke zones.
---
• Remove or redesign mutations to be better suited and balanced for PVP. Some are just too OP and unbalanced like the one that gives you insane energy resistance.
---
All the ingredients are in the game already for this to work. Many of the systems are already in place and just need modifying. Fallout true survival could be absolutely amazing. Everything you do in the game would matter and have real consequences. With this particular rulset, you could afford to go a little further with what the player drops on death as well. Maybe as well as a few aid items and junk they might also drop a random unequipped weapon or armour piece just to make it that little bit more intense.
---
Edit: Just wanted to add a couple things I missed off that others have brought up.
---
• Base destruction needs to be reworked so that somebody cannot destroy a player's construction in a matter of minutes with a sledge hammer. I would suggest making all standard weapons and tools deal minimal damage to bases and instead players would need to craft or purchase rare and expensive items such as C4 or lockpicks to breach. If this was balanced correctly then you wouldn't get greifers going round totally demolishing bases and instead base raiding would become more of a strategic decision. If you built in some sort of risk reward system then a new end-game base raiding / defending loop could form. So long as it's not an easy task and the necessary resources to raid are hard to get then this could be a real game changer. I'm not going to name any games in particular but pretty much every other PVP survival game that has bases and raiding allows you to steal items stored should you breach to the loot rooms. I'm not saying Fallout should go down that path but it would certainly add a new end-game loop for survival mode. Maybe players can only store something like 200-400lbs of loot in their invincible stash and the rest must be stored in containers that can be breached using lock picks or explosives (Assuming the owner locks them)?
---
• Following on from the point above, we need a notification for when our bases are under attack much like when in Fallout 4 we got notifications when our settlements were under attack.
---
• VATS is something that doesn't get brought up much in PVP but it's one I would definitely look at reworking. It's a strange one because every other developer of PVP survival games out there invest a huge amount of resources trying to prevent aim bot style cheats which is basically what VATS is. In Fallout 76 it seems to have been embraced :-) Dying to players using OP Vats builds can leave you feeling cheated by the game in the same way dying to players with totally overpowered sentinel assassin gear does. I would suggest either disabling VATS when it came to targeting other human players or dramatically reducing the accuracy. I'd be interested to know the thoughts of others on the subject of VATS in PVP.
---
Yes, levelling a new character is faster than reallocating stats one stat per level!
---
You need to add them as a friend first and then if they're playing the game you can jump onto their server.
---
I think its playable yes at least wort to try I think
---
Not sure but you can totally just go to whitesprings and see for yourself since all the vendors are there.
---
Go to the friends tab and go to the find someone option. Put in their GT and join the game.
---
Whatever is most comfortable. I play in 1st mostly but I use 3rd if I'm behind cover and need to see around corners
---
They could just have Pre-War Riot Armor and leave off any NCR insignia, like that armor you find in Honest Hearts.
---
technically the gauss fires ballistic projectiles but its class is an energy weapon. So really hard to say, they dont seem as rare as say a tse laser rifle but you still dont really see people posting that they found one
---
I think that alot has changed in the game.  There is way more things to do on e finishing the main story now.  I just finished the tadpole quests to get my backpack, and now I am trying to respec my build into a sneaky sniper.  I would say in the last month the game has improved.  However, there are still some annoying bugs but thinks are changing.
---
It'd be a minor convenience.  I mean, your stash box is literally inches away from the vendor, so if you forgot something it's not that big of a deal to just go and get it.
---
true
---
Same here on my ps4 pro,.. Get disconnected on occasion, but a hell of a lot less often than I used to
---
The watuga vendor has alot as well.
---
Isn't the main bug the fact it has explosive to begin with 😂
---
The real questions.
---
Yes I own the game and I felt it was enjoyable, it was just all of these annoying little things that eventually overwhelmed my patience so I bailed. I've played it for an upwards of 80 hours, I think.
---
Alright, thanks, glad to hear it!
---
It helps, but is not necessarily needed in nuke zones, in my opinion.  If you're going for a stealth rifleman build I imagine depending on your weapon should be capable of killing them as easily as most  mobs. 
---
Build recommendations 
---
Regarding your build, it looks pretty solid, the only things I'd recommend changing are Bandolier with  strong back rank 2, or even drop sturdy frame as well for strong back rank 4. This will help with the ridiculous weight of rifles. I don't think concentrated fire increases your damage per shot as the card describes. It just makes reaching 95% on a limb more easier to achieve. White knight was/is still a decent perk in of itself, but I'd only equip it when I need to repair my gear, as if you're utilizing stealth you should rarely be getting hit. The perk card Adrenaline is a really good perk even if you only want to grab 1 rank of it just for the stacking damage increase.
---
Yeah then it's definitely worth trying.
---
And why didn't u say gmea?
---
Possibly grafton. They sell a ton of combat plans there
---
I'm not Danish and I won't pretend to be!
---
Wut
---
I did queen of the hunt the other day and on my way to one of the cryptids I stumbled across a flat woods so its defo possible
---
Whats the dithering from?  Is that a noise filter?
---
you mean you can't figure it out by the notebook with a couple loose blank pages?
---
On only one .50cal receiver out of 4.
---
The quest starts for me everytime I visit the mire now
---
It would bring the world to life so hard
---
Also, glad you aren't salty. Can't say the same for the previous owner of this shop.

Lighthouse souvenir (lighthouse near vault 76)

clean folded american flag

I would like to get the pet rock but its a quest item

First 4 points all could been avoided by just instancing event out for premade groups, like every other and proven to work design for decades behind dungeons in online games. There is nothing wrong analyzing others game and making it clear how these things work.
---
1) The reason it‘s empty are the mapmarkers I think 
---
2) F*CK ! source ?
---
Fucking dupers /s
---
No unfortunately it does not.
---
Source: I have both perks and regularly grind Artkos Pharma.
---
Im in no way a min maxer, I have a toon I use to complete new content. I often use other toons to role play and enjoy fallout the way I feel it was made to be enjoyed via random silly encounters in the wasteland getting drunk on nukashine to see where I wake up in a hungover stumbling way and take the walk of possible shame back home. You are the kind of person I like to call an assumer. Remember kids assumption is the mother of all fuck ups.
---
Having a toon to get through difficult or new content is always wise. There is also something to be said about learning the ins and outs of a games damage and defense system. When you should equip or use certain perk, skills or items. You know learning the game. I don't like to show up to an imposter or paradise event and be absolutely useless because it's fun to run around with mysterious stranger and hope an NPC can spawn to help me finish said quest because I built a useless character. But you know that's just I enjoy actually learning and playing a game but as with many things with people now. You want to just show up and hope others do all the work for you. But hey I must be a min/maxer lol. I'll leave this mic right here
---
Oh my god, bro, this is so much change and at this rate would take bethesda like 12 years to accomplish. This game is far more complex pvp wise than i think you understand. Vats is 100% avoidable. Avoiding it is as much of a mechanic as using it. Assassin sentinel is not overpowered (maybe when you combine stealthboys?). The game is all about sneaking to avoid vats, sentinel just makes you a sitting duck. I think your information is outdated sir.
---
As for creating a fresh server, do you realize how bad this would turn out down the road when everyone is powerful again (being an mmoish game power gaps are huge)? Noobs would stand no chance lol. The resources would be tightly controlled. It really just would not be successful. Honestly i'd appreciate just hearing your thoughts on the map problem thx.
---
I wish everyone would realize this is meant to be an RPG not a game battle pro survival game or whatever.
---
This is a bit misleading because in FO4 the alien you can find is alive whereas it isn't in FO76. Meaning the "while fighting an alien" wording in the challenge really means "while fighting a Flatwoods Monster."
---
sold 10 of them for zero caps and nobody took more than one which surprised me
---
Grafton station all plans are there for 1k caps
---
Tank killer is a must...I prefer concentrated fire over long shot but I saw you don't really use vats so that may not work for you... You might want to run alot of  points in agility and luck ( I have 15/8 but always want more in luck  but haven't moved a point yet).
---
just find a new place and move camp, you'll feel better once its all done
---
There is a garbage bag with a few hundred White Fedoras in it behind my Camp in the lake. Help yourself
---
PvP at Lv 5 ?
---
Oh....my....god!
---
What an absolute strawman. Nobody said bosses can't be hard to kill. But at least make them more complex than "yeah they have a lot of health".
---
How about a boss that uses stealth like a player might to pick us off one by one. Creating an Alien (the movie) like atmosphere where this deadly yet unseen force is picking off this squad of heavily armoured marines. 
---
Just generally make the enviroment more part of the game, almost every boss fight takes place on open ground. What about a boss sitting on top of a barricaded tower sniping us and players have to fight their way up a trapped obstacle course before quicky slaughtering the squishy sniper.
---
There is so much more potential here. Fallout 76 has in my opinion the single best designed world and dungeons of any game I've ever played. Yet bosses don't interact with the level design in any way. A boss fight in an underground pharmaceutical jungle feels the same as a boss fight in literally every single other location in the game. That's just wrong. Level design is Bethesda's single greatest strength, yet they seem unable to integrate it with other aspects of the game
---
Most people probably just do the default whatever the game says for things.
---
I get killed by invisible ghouls at whitesprings all the damn time. It’s so infuriating sometimes, because you’ll just stand there unable to do anything about it.
---
Can't ever see why I'd need more than I already have but neat anyway.  
---
You can also spam a combat knife mod that uses no materials to get about 160 free atoms through some of the modding challenges.
---
If you read my post a key aspect of it was about rebalancing PVP and making all weapons deadly, closing the gap between god tier and noob gear so that fresh spawns do have a chance.  
---
While my post is fairly chunky, the bulk of it is mostly re-balance not a complete rewrite of the game engine.  
---
Also what's the point in having a new mode that's supposed to be difficult when you can just swap between easy mode and survival at will? Nobody is bound or committed to it so why invest time in it other than to get a quick round of death match?
---
It's an Icelandic vs Danish thing, don't worry about, you sloths don't catch on very quickly anyway.
---
What time do you normally play?
---
Tank killer is a huge boon to your damage against loads of table stuff like some muties etc. concentrated fire is great if vats is your thing. Glowsight is great if you’ve got room but all 9 rifleman is still very good despite the diminishment. What exactly is the focus? Sneaky rifleman?
---
It’s not a failure. Stop posting opinion as fact. I enjoy it
---
Oh I love that idea actually! Especially buffing the creature as it is so in line with the location
---
This isn’t for “the average player” do you guys read? It’s for well equipped +50 groups. The average player shouldn’t be there
---
Link to the video please.
---
Good point. Building walls around it was just a waste of time...
---
...Randomly dropped rewards suck? It’s a fucking loot shooter. What?
---
Juicehead made a video on it a while back. It seems it'll begin in Vault 51, and the more you play, the more of Vault 51 will unlock for you. You can actually find holotapes for the Vault 51 overseer and his corpse in the game already.
---
I wish Vault 51 was more alien stuff....
---
3rd has obvious benefits over 1st person but it can get a bit glitchy with the angle up close
---
All Events need to be listed on the personal terminal with timers.
---
Someone said they are because they don't drop anymore but I'm not sure
---
lights?
---
Yea I'm not really into vats. I usually only use it as a scouting option to centre on enemies and not actually as a damage tool. I've been playing around with the special builder and I ended up with 14 for agility which need changing.
---
Dodgy 3, action boy 3, Adrenaline 5 and white knight 3. 
---
Luck was 10 with
---
bloody mess 3, stached genes 2, tormentor 3 and class freak 3
---
I suppose the defensive options are possibly not worth it depending on if your not going to get hit? But I don't really like glass cannon builds and want a bit of survivability
---
Every point about it being too hard for the average player or solo complaints are totally invalid. They specifically said a well equipped GROUP of 50+ players otherwise you’d struggle.
---
Lol watta jerk xD 
---
The tower was a blueprint, and the fences and signs and everything else took less time to throw down than to gather 10 acid. I essentially just place everything randomly, spinning and tapping the button so it’s chaotic. Watch out for the mattresses, next time I think I’ll put them around gates to try and force some to use the interact button. 
---
Your sign was pretty clever I’ll admit. If anyone saw it in all that rubble (besides me) I’m sure it left an impression. Nice work.
---
Higher level super mutants are sponges? Are you kidding me right now?
---
Do you want to one shot every enemy?
---
In case you didn't know, you can get credit for completing multiple subchallenges within the daily level up challenge with a single level up. For example, the other day I got credit for 3 at once from leveling up a single time (level up while over level 76, level up while intoxicated, and one other one I can't remember).
---
I suppose. But what’s the point of that?
---
Did you leave the server?
---
While true that no one will buy a zealots anything, a lot of good 1* can be sold for good caps. I just sold an AA lever action for 2k caps.
---
There's a lot of players who just chill out in survival. Fallout is a roleplaying game, this isn't rust or ark. It's not anything like that. Honestly you don't seem to know very much about pvp in this game at all and you're asking for serious changes. You people need to stop thinking that there is no point if you are not spawned at level 1.
---
Thanks, yeah Xbox. I’m not hurting for the fusion cores, just so damn frustrating when you keep getting it taken from you.
---
Yea I'm gonna get 3 glowsight which I suppose is situational for nuke zone farming. Tank killer im starting to agree with as I tried the Armor piercing mod, but going from a 80 round gun to a 10 round one wasn't worth it with all the reloading :/
---
Im not really sure on the focus which is why I need input lol. Im not really wanted full on sneak, just a general build to maximise the handmade damage. Vats and sneak im not bothered about really, will only really use them when entering combat against lone enemies to pick them off quicker
---
Otherwise id be running around and shooting them down 
---
Although ill ensure to get all the rifleman cards to 3 then :)
---
Survival is dead because of Adventure mode. 90% you spend in adventure mode, because everything there is faster- you get faster loot, you get faster done with dailies, you get everything faster. There is just no point living in survival mode. 10% you spend in survival mode is the thrill to be on top of the leaderboard. Even the rewards aint worth playing survival mode. When TSE provides sustained 65% damage output increase, those survival mode rewards at best provide 20% sustained increase, what makes them pointless to chase after.
---
Thanks. Each member that tags has our own version, and we all have them blueprinted to make them easier to drop. 
---
I prefer the stripped down version that's attached to world objects like the retaining wall behind the workbench, but it's fickle about where it'll place sometimes. 
---
One of the other guys has a gas sign with it on it blueprinted with the generator and power conduit all on top.

For real.  I hate places like that.  Look for a window and see if you can activate a workbench/bed/chair/etc.. from outside so you get warped into their place.
---
Not to mention most of the time it's unplayable because it crashes when trying to load into the event!
---
Yeah was busy doing sloth things sorry
---
Exactly this. Just so damn frustrating to have this gut TSE .50 cal just murdering me and taking my money and workshop...
---
1TB NvMe SSD on PCIe, 3500 MB/s top read speed. 
---
In fact, this is my stronger machine. I have a i7 4770K with the same card and SATA SSD (540 MB/s top) which does not have this apparent problem - but has a different one, namely audio loading hiccups.
---
He’s gonna have to drop one of those perks he’s actually only got two points available there lol. Depending on if he’s actually rolling in like 10k 5.56 he may actually want bandolier though.
---
Well, my vendors are outside, I have workbenches on the basement and the stash in the first floor.
---
I do not close my door.
---
But PLEASE, do close the doors if you leave, I hate to run around close them after you. Thanks.
---
It actually isn't necessary to claim the workshops, just repair a pod and a shiny vertibird will spawn in.
---
For low levels (munition factory and Grafton steel might be a bit hard): Wade Airport near Charleston has two Vertibird landing pods, the Poseidon Power plant near Charleston station has one pod too.
---
Energy weapons kills supermutants pretty well. They have not much energy resistane. Supermutants are the problem just because of ballistic weapon meta
---
Evasive is nice...I don't use White Knight...repair benches are too plentiful to justify it plus...repair kits (shhhh).
---
My camp is unlocked so people can use the facilities and my vendors are outside.
---
I just wish people would shut the doors after they are finished
---
There’s a bug where if you use plasma or laser weapons in places like whitesprings, the mobs will sometimes respawn as ash or goo piles when another player arrives. I don’t know why Bethesda hasn’t fixed that yet.
---
Too funny. You should keep doing it, first of its kind that I’ve seen after all this time. Feel free to come at me again, I’m trying to find a way to survive these assaults lol
---
Drop gun fu down to one or something just get at least one point of adrenaline there. Hell adrenal reaction wouldn’t be bad since you’ve got class freak 3. This is pretty much what my stealth character runs
---
&gt;They failed to make a team oriented event? 
---
I mean... yeah. Have you read the post? How can they claim this is successful team oriented gameplay when players are incentivised to drop to drop the objective, screwing over the team, to get a kill on an enemy that is about to go down.
---
You get shafted in a team you get shafted harder when playing solo. Everyone gets shafted yet you're defending the shafting for some reason and pretending like Reddit is wrong for calling it out
---
Just stayed in ny house sulking
---
Survival mode is dead because death is inevitable and makes the whole survival thing not fun. It's not "survival" when you have no choice but to die lol. Pinpoint map locations is the topic here and its really annoying having you people comment this irrelevant nonsense lol
---
Haha true!
---
Are you playing on PC, OP? I really want to see this in person.
---
I've seen them make changes and give feedback - with my own eyes - while I was playing and part of the community.
---
I'm a regular rifleman build (no vats, no crits, no bloodied) so Glow Sight is essential for me with Handmade. It still takes me 6-10 rounds to kill a Glowing One with a Furious Handmade when I can land consecutive hits.
---
You: "i spend time on my build so it does the most damage"
---
Also you "but I'm totally not a minmaxer" 
---
Lol dude it's fine if you are a minmaxer, some people just play the game that way. Also you are now saying that not only should people minmax but also that we should all sp3nd ev3n more time to have 1 character for minmax and 1 for RP, alot of players barely have time to enjoy one character.
---
Ahh... well they intended for you to get mad and peace out... so I mean you really ended up with the last laugh by not leaving... but tbh, would probably make them continue to screw with you until you left...
---
Honestly i love the game but it's still a buggy mess
---
Thanks. Once I gather the mats I'm gonna make up a bunch of Blackwater Brew. When I empty a bag I'll leave one as the only item in the bag so the quest marker is still active, but their loot is long gone. Would like to do it with the "you've been insulted" note, but they're so hard to come by.
---
The initial bright flash from the nuke explosion makes your character phase in and out of existence while in camera mode. I'm mid-phase.
---
Yeah right. Most of the smart players keep the legendaries they want in the stash so they don't accidentally get scrapped. Like it was said......there is a stash box feet from the machine.
---
They mentioned they'd look into explosive energy weapons at some later stage. My guess is we'll get new legendary effects specific to energy weapons to replace explosive
---
Shit my apologies, I copied it but got distracted by uni and forgot to paste.
---
[Here’s](https://youtu.be/2AyA3qa8X24) the link.
---
now if only anthem improved too
---
But why would you want extras? I mean dont get me wrong, I do pick them up everytime I see them... but only to drop a bunch because mentally they tax my weight (I know they dont have weight, hence why I said mentally)
---
I was actively getting electrocuted during encryptid event to let higher level players slay the "sheepsquatch" only to find that I could not partake of treasure. It made me sad because I used all my stimpaks.
---
But they didn’t.
---
Yes, but don't tag them too early. The Sheepsquatch mutates into a legendary just in 1-2 seconds after it pops up so if you tag it too early, no legendary loot. Also tagging the SBQ too early may not give you a legendary event reward in my experience.
---
Really appreciate the responses y'all. Gives me an idea of what to expect ♥️
---
If you're interested in rolling with me on PC feel free to add me: Jevans094.
---
I have two that refuse to work. They have other things to worry about than adding new achievements rn but I’m sure they’ll add some eventually
---
Well its not even the break speed its the repair cost mainly lol. But then again I suppose I could just equip it when I repair the gear?
---
If so I best farm some ballistic fibre lol
---
I agree, I mean, not to cast a curse or anything, but look at WoW.
---
Bosses having multiple phases, or triggers. Multiple abilities that are different than the normal mobs. Having positional triggers? Jeezus, I'd hate to see a "don't stand near another player" trigger.
---
Really, what's different from the SBQ and normal SBs other than her massive amount of health? There's a different model and different spell effects but... I couldn't tell you. Maybe that jumping attack? I really couldn't tell you.
---
Hell, with the legendary regeneration trigger there's an inbuilt phase change. Make the boss do flame attacks, or poison, or hell maybe extra armor durability damage, I don't know.
---
Maybe during the legendary health regeneration, a Mirelurk Queen spawns a horde of mirelurks? Maybe a Sheepsquatch yells out a debuff that has to be cured with special chemicals? I don't know, this really isn't rocket surgery and yet... and yet... yeah.
---
Additional health = difficulty should be thrown out the airlock.
---
It isn’t rare in my experience
---
You gotta be prepared and level 50 will help for sure but we don't wanna exclude casual players
---
Fun little thing you can do if you want just switch perk cards. Also does it matter what level your character is if it's useless? So how many toons you have is a dumb argument. If your calling me a min maxer because on my first play through I build a proper character and learn all said systems of the game. Then yes I am. People come with the dumbest argument. If you guys want to waste time and money buying and playing a game and not learn how to actually play it that's on you. I simply server hop when I join events filled with people like the majority of you. That event will fail I will go on to completing 98% of the ones I join and get my imposter mascots and stimpak diffusers easily have fun roobs
---
Gooood moooorning Appalaaachiaaaa
---
The purpose of your post? Inflating your ego? Less showing-off, kid, you did nothing special.
---
Awesome!   Seeing as help I have your attention for that could you please add in to have them fix the mire quests so that they can actually repeat as well? I haven't been able to do them since January and I know a lot of other people on xbox haven't been able to get any of the daily quest from that region either. That would be awesome as well!
---
I
---
This isn’t a general engine issue it’s a polish issue. At least insult them correctly.
---
FOV and DoF sliders don't really do too much for consoles because users because are farther away from the screen. On PC where the user is typically 1-2 feet from the monitor it can make a significant impact on motion sickness and eye strain caused by their original silly settings (default was like 65 degrees iirc). Many people could not play the game because of this. While I agree there was some overreacting over small aspects of the game around launch I feel like this particular case was justified.
---
Oh I got you! I'm hoping that something like that is implemented when they give us the waist Landers DLC. They keep saying that it's gonna change everything so fingers crossed!
---
I've got a bloodied radicool and solar powered build and if I use party boy with whisky and a full set of unyeilding with mole rat chunks stingwing filet glowing meat steak and sheepsquatch meat that bumps it up like crazy, then adrenaline stacks another 60% onto that! I die in like one hit but it's a fun tradeoff. Twisted muscles and adrenal reaction also help
---
I agree the mechanics need to be changed but there should be a way to hunt people, i dont go into survival to do pve
---
of course its subjective I am voicing an opinion. I made no complaints about what anyone else wants, Bethesda has responded to the loudest complaints first. I didn't say I liked or disliked what they were crying about, I am not making a moral stance I simply said they should prioritize listening to people who are happy and not people who are already pissed and already halfway out the door.
---
I would say the biggest problem is it not being instanced if we dont start getting instanced dungeons and events here soon (yes I know the raids are supposed to be instanced) then this game is going to have a lot of trouble in the long run. Not to mention the whole only 24 people on a sever is going to have to change too.
---
not same damages. because energy weapon with explosive ignore enemies armor.
---
I can think of a few other words for people like that
---
It was 😅
---
*bait
---
Hold up, I like this. Gonna make an attempt to do it later
---
Been struggling with this kind of stutter ever since FO:NV. Today I managed to "fix" it (or at least make it not noticeable) and it basically comes down to getting the game to run at above 80 fps (hard capped it at 100fps but it rarely gets there despite not using 100% of neither CPU nor GPU). Not the solution I'd like but the only one that worked so far and I've tried EVERYTHING. To be clear - it didn't remove the stutter, it just made it so small that it blends in with the way the image moves when looking around and as such is not noticeable anymore.
---
My specs:
---
* i7-8700K oc'ed to 4,9GHz
---
* GTX 1080 oc'ed to 1820 MHz
---
* 32GB ram @3000MHz
---
* Installed on a relatively new SSD with lots of space left
---
I was getting the stutter in almost any interior.
---
What worked for me:
---
* reducing resolution from 2560x1440 to 1920x1080 
---
* running in fullscreen rather than borderless
---
Other than that I'm still running the medium preset for display options which other than the stutters was perfectly playable at a stable 50-60fps at the higher resolution. With this hardware I kinda wish the game was actually playable without those reductions but what can we do...  
---
Didn't play with the display settings yet but it may turn out that after this reduction in the resolution I may be able to squeeze some higher settings in while keeping the fps high enough to nullify the stutter.
---
thank you
---
Damn, thanks for the info.
---
And nothing I’ve suggested would change anybody’s right to chill out in survival mode, in fact they’d be able to chill out even more than the existing version as they wouldn’t have to deal with concerns of being marked on the map or out in the world with a big red marker. 
---
You say I don’t understand what I’m suggesting yet you clearly haven’t read and properly understood my post.
---
From patch 5 :  
---
* **Weapons:** Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
* **Dev Note:**  The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . .  explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve  temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied  so we can make adjustments.
---
Which is my point. they make changes based off the largest pile of complaints thrown at them. I am not saying they shouldn't fix disastrous problems. but when it comes to changes to the game rules and quality of life stuff etc they should listen to those most likely to stick it out.
---
I see the clickbait titles did their jobs lmao no they are the most useless things you could spend money on unless you’re pretty low level tbh. The advanced ones you get from killing the queen are handy to keep around but I really can’t imagine spending real money on these things
---
You can get more than 2 even
---
Match making at events is the answer in my opinion.
---
Yeah the formula Q run (activating quercy who gives them Q instead of P) is only viable if you have a full dedicated team to get all 3 troughs fully filled.
---
Because while they get healed each round, the fact they fight back means that the alpha can absolutely trounce them if they're not the class 3 for the biome.
---
God let’s just do that here please 🙄 I mean why even come to the most biased place you could randomly choose lmao
---
There is a stash box 10 feet from every scrip machine.
---
That's just laziness.
---
Just send invites out to people... it brings them to main menu and then back in.
---
So do you play it?
---
For  Uranium Fever I usually only get one legendary, Whitespring also mostly one to three. Leader of pack don't know, I don't this event too often. Don't even knwo what AWOL or Free States event is. So, I guess I am playing it wrong or maybe I need to server hop.
---
Anyhow, thanks I will look out for the events you listed.
---
The last time i left my doors unlocked some asshole lured 3 super mutants into my house. They destroyed about 70% of my house including my fusion genny and rad shower. The guy sat there and snapped pictures the whole time. 
---
No thanks. Stash box is next to my vending machines.
---
Do you have the *+250 DR while reloading* legendary effect. There is a bug currently that lowers weapon damage if you reload such a gun.
---
It's fix it good, same as your pa for increased durability on your armor... I am always looking for ballistic fibre to the point I actually buy it so there is some trade off for not running White Knight. But I'm always shifting cards in agility based on situation and there are so many good ones  I can never fit it in.
---
I really can’t imagine doing it without that website. I don’t think I’d bother tbh
---
Yes you agreed with the point of my post. Thank you for that. I'm referring to the billion other points you are trying to make.
---
Sounds like you and your friends live in an echo chamber
---
I think you meant to say Lonesome Road. :D Good idea!
---
Tank killer 3 + stinging mag  and all possible rifle dmg perks
---
Oh I'm fully aware of that, but doesnt always work so w...... they will grief workshops as a secondary purpose...
---
So this isn’t a post for Reddit, this is something you should take directly to Bethesda’s support site.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by:  
---
&gt;So all these high lvl people are just filling out all the cards so they can change builds in a couple of lvls?
---
There is no level cap.  If you had a build in mind, the first few levels afterwards you are probably still getting the last of the high level cards.  After that, you might be focusing on getting some of the more situational cards or maxing out all the possible crafting cards. The respec might just be used if you decide that maybe you should move one point over from say agility to luck. 
---
Yes, it would take 14 levels to make such a drastic change from say rifles to melee if you had a STR of 1 after level 50, but this isn't abnormal.  I can't speak to ESO but no other Elderscrolls/Fallout game has ever given you a full respec without mods. 
---
Of course... you have 4 other characters, if you wanted to try melee it might be easier to just make a new character, or make your build more well rounded.  Some stats don't even need to have stats put in - STR for example already covers, Melee, Heavy Guns, Shotguns, and unarmed.  
---
To be clear, I'm not opposed to the idea, just that I don't think we are entitled to it or that it's a required feature, the vast majority of games I have don't offer respecs
---
They can also be sold at vendors for a cap a piece... so essentially 8-12 Bobby pins are free caps in the future. I pick up every Bobby pin I see and use as my last bit of fill in at the vendors.
---
i dont see tesla rifle there either
---
They do stand up man those weird fucks walk around like that
---
So basically you saw a detailed piece of player feedback on survival mode that you couldn’t be arsed to properly read and understand and thought made a load of statements that are either irrelevant or just incorrect? Nice one 🤔
---
Sorry, I forgot to mention, that my game crashed after drop to 10 fps at this location. I think thats outdated engines fault.
---
Drifter looks cool with the plauge
---
Enjoyed the event, nothing too special  but enjoyed it so I came here to disagree but dude you are so right, everything about what you said is so relevant
---
Why not use PA for both melee and the handmade?
---
Soften them up from afar, then finish them with melee. Definitely want one star in each of the rifleman perks, and maxed out Tank Killer.
---
How do u take photos?
---
This is the ideal pick, each character could cover certain events, rose could cover nukes and larger events like encryptid and scorch beast queen fights. While biv can mention workshop takeovers. Then graham, the purveyor, and the vendors can advertise their shops.
---
Yes the purveyor would get on and senselessly grunt, hen the radio host would awkwardly have her leave then say something like ,”are you done mam? (Door slams in background) well that was... amusing, go on down to Berkeley station for some legendary deals”.
---
Open menu, hit the button for photomode.
---
Hey, your camp is only a few yards from where  mine lives. Enemies like to spawn in that tunnel and attack my camp.
---
Well that’s fine that you don’t know what an “engine” is but again they just haven’t ironed out the kinks. They should. They have not. This were the refund demands should come from not some bag nobody is actually using. The game barely functions.
---
I think having a radio dj would go a long long way of making the world feel more alive. That might be one of the reasons I don't listen to the radio much. No personalities like in previous games.
---
Getting handicapped for searching out mods for your guns to improve them is counter intuitive to what modding a weapon, or anything, is.
---
AA Lever Action Rifle I can understand, but most common 1\* legendaries aren't going to sell even at 10 caps.
---
Thx it worked.
---
Grafton has it, just under 1k.
---
Oh ok sweet yeah like the other guy said use the stinging mag. Little over half the armor penetration of the perforating mag and with 35 rounds. Also pop on the compensator if you haven’t as it basically removes horizontal recoil. Very controllable at that point.
---
Sittin at the vendor.. googling what the hell is this... feels a little too much like real life, Bethesda...
---
Yeah this is a good suggestion. Especially for plans with obscure titles.
---
Thanks anyway then. I’m still saving up some caps, so I couldn’t buy it now.
---
I didn’t say that it’s a great team experience but it is obviously meant to be done in a team. You wanna make stuff up you can do it without commenting here lol
---
so what you want is more personal items to place around that arent junk items I can think of some 
---
the metal wire trash bins that you see in office buildings (in game) and a version that is full of crumpled paper
---
a drinking bird that dips its head into a cup of water when you interact with it 
---
those big boxes of printer paper
---
a stapler, a cup of pens/pencils, a pencil sharpener 
---
an open book and a stack of books 
---
a clipboard that can hold a single note 
---
a knife embed in a wall that can hold a note
---
a pinboard that can hold several notes
---
record players that can play certain songs from places (nukashine, van lowe taxidermy, the purveyor's shop music)
---
signs you can type onto to leave messages  
---
bathroom sinks/mirrors sink acts as water pumps and the mirror is a stash box
---
toilet paper holder that attaches to walls 
---
a fridge I think one is in the files right now but its under atomic shop but so was the personal terminal and that was free. 
---
countertops and a kitchen island so I can have a dream kitchen
---
a wooden breadbox half open with some bread in it 
---
a set of honey and jam jars open and non open versions open has a knife stuck in one of the jars and a peice of toast on a plate
---
Ushanka hat and union uniform is pretty decent with it. The scribe hat too, but the goggles on top give you more eyes.
---
I’d sue if my chocolate exploded in my face bruh
---
Build a wall.
---
Upper right hand of the page we're on now, under where it says JOINED and CREATE POST, look in community options for the user flair.
---
This was one of the things I loved the most about previous Fallouts, up until they got really repetitive. Luckily with 76 additional content could be added with every patch, so it will always be fresh.
---
Most of the newer AKs use 5.45 now.
---
The problem is that most non gun nuts dont realize how many dif ammo types there are. If they made it "realistic", peeps would complain its too complicated.
---
Right, I think that game is lost.  I enjoyed it until I got to endgame, then it just slowed to a crawl.
---
Your entire last sentence goes against everything ive seen on this sub recently, i wouldnt say people are on the verge of quitting they are saying the game is the best itsbeen and bethesda did well to turn it around.  
---
Regardless, requests and bug reports ect should not be in a demanding way, there is 0 need to be a knobhead when asking for something.  
---
Losing your temper over something completely over shadows and good points it could have made.  
---
If you are being shiity to bethesda especially in the title of your post theyre just gonna scroll past it, why wouldnt they, theyre gonna look at it and think "im just gonna get attacked going in there, avoid"
---
Yup - the majority of players in the game have no interest in PvP whatsoever.  And PvP players are mostly trolls in adventure mode, so that bad behavior isn't helping the cause for not having PvP be entirely in a separate game mode (or two, Nuclear Winter might provide another PvP game mode).  We just want our own pool to play in without trolls.
---
No it has exploding shots, 90% weight reduction  and more dmg the lower my resistance.
---
It's strange as hell, if I have this gun equipped it effects the stats of all my other guns till I equip them then they go back to saying the right dmg amount ? But now I'm unsure if they are or not, it feels wrong, my game seems really buggy now aswell, I've crashed twice and loading back in across the other side of the map, and things I kill keep vanishing. 
---
This is really not good
---
&gt;back
---
I assume they would get trapped in the bog?
---
I mean I can buy some of that off of you
---
At some point a players level stops denoting their power. A level 530 may actually be weaker than a 200. The only power gains past level 50 is ironing out special allocation and getting better gear so they can’t just endlessly increase the enemy levels if they don’t increase player power as well I mean I’m not trynna fight a level 450 radroach one day lol
---
I thought camp damage was turned off?
---
I meannnn if they did all the work the people that did nothing don’t deserve it
---
Company motto, apparently: "We'll profit from this...somehow."
---
I'm only selling plans and booze, you don't need the rest of my camp.
---
oh this could help me to start 76 via Steam without having to login every time
---
thanks
---
same reply to both, stinging magazine I suppose is a combination the Armor piercing mod and drum magazine?
---
So I get the best of both worlds but not maximum effect? Sounds good to me if so :)
---
Message vs messenger, I agree. Cringey title with some valid points.
---
I’d have to assume that’d be much easier on the servers than me spamming craft on 300 lead ore for a couple minutes lmao
---
My place has the benches on the top deck, along with anything someone passing by might need. But the vendors are downstairs, forcing people who want to buy stuff to see my awesome bar.
---
Nothing locked. Except players that spawn in the floor. They are locked in place.
---
I'm saying the people one shotting doing no work.
---
I use some of the workshops for a quick and dirty resource suck, acid is my favourite and I enjoy the angler farming, but I always expect to get melted by some sneaky explosive two shot in the back, so always (if I remember) dump regularly everything into a stash box.
---
Anything bloodied, AA, instigating on slow hard hitters, and furious/vamp on fast hitters is worth thinking about selling.
---
You said “even if you did all the work”
---
Well it was easy to have on the PA durability card since it was INT I always had space for it, now with agaility its gonna be hard :/
---
Ive grown to love the combo of dodgy and action boy for damage mitigation, since if anything does get close ive room for error to sprint away to start firing again
---
Is the reward weapon any good? I'm trying to get all the Survival Mode challenge weapons so far (been easier until now, obv).
---
No I didn't. Read again.
---
I thought that legendary drills were actually added to the pool along with shovels so it would drop with effects. Is that not the case?
---
So I play 99% solo and you expect me to completely change my entire build for the ten minutes I'm in an event with you so you can get your participation trophy...scumbag is better then   whiney baby...who are you to tell me how to play?
---
“Even if they were at the event first and did all the work”
---
Such are the woes of PVP workshops, just go in quick, claim, harvest and get away, never linger :) Then pop back to do a defend event and harvest the resource, but leave quickly.
---
You seem to be getting very offended over this. Everything okay?
---
Ive also considered that too but playing with the builder means id have a middle ground damage on each and nothing massive, I suppose jack of all trades?
---
If there was an easier way to respect in this game and do perk loadouts then id definitely go for it, because right now its some time consuming :(
---
Well one word for you is weak call me an asshole but get in line because it's pretty fucking long dude
---
It knows what you did.
---
THEY ALL KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
---
Stinging has 30% ?? Not sure piercing &amp; 35 rounds .  I mostly have different handmades and my favourite one against bigger enemies is a AA faster fire rate less vats cost with drum mag though 👍 85 rounds with pretty good ap is nice.
---
Or one can go quad ffr with perforating mag 👍
---
Lol I love fun king with idiots on Reddit I'm eating breakfast with my son lmao at this
---
I use Berserker weapons and find there is a little glitch with the Pipboy screen reading the damage output. Ill use a berserker weapon with its 50% bonus and reads a high level output (which it correct). I then open my pipboy hover over AA pistol and it shows 70ish damage then I select it and drops to 45ish (45 is what it should be). Hope this helps.
---
Yeah he was awful casual about the hours and hours you’d have to invest to get one gun haha
---
PLEASE BETHESDA I’m tired of either googling plans or blindly buying them hoping that they’re the right ones
---
If you run a build that one shots - person A
---
Without letting THEM get a tag despite THEM doing the work - person B
---
👍
---
Are you stupid or just special
---
This needs to happen
---
Are you on pvp server?
---
That hasn't worked for me since the last patch. 
---
Has anyone else been able to do it post patch?
---
You were just trying to help
---
This.....Exactly this....
---
Fair comment. Guess we just all have to grind more legendaries and see if one drops...
---
that said, the tesla rifle doesn't fire bullets, unlike tha gauss. and it does specifically refer to that. .. unless we don't count gauss projectiles as bullets i guess. but they do deal ballistic dmg, so.. yeah, who knows ? &gt;&lt;
---
I have yet to even be able to get into Project Paradise on Xbox..I’ve reset my Xbox a couple times now. What am I doing wrong?
---
Oh then yea your right lol
---
Lol just realized the OPs user name
---
I’m not gonna ask a child porn enthusiast of child porn is neat
---
I wish I had your confidence and gear, I'm never able to defend myself against other players, they always destroy me with God weapons, I'm bloodied build so I die easily but can one hit kill everything so long as I get in sneaky close and smack them with my bloodied deathclaw, if I get the timing wrong I die, then I die and then die LOL
---
Another thing is that many translations are currently bugged and ruddled with random snippets of mod names or nuclear winter spoilers 
---
Especially for the new event one objective is called "stabilzed long barrel" in the german translation so many people might be confused on what the actual objective is
---
I built on a cliff and all my defences on one side... nothing lives long enough to fight back...
---
AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA!
---
Maybe it's a boy?
---
That would be so awesome! A very nice addition to the current radio program.
---
So I do all the work and get no reward, you swoop in and prevent me getting a reward from doing my work, even though I was there before you? You'd be happy with that if you were the one getting no reward? I doubt it.
---
Nobody is going to go search for the video, just link it in your post.
---
The... burrows?... the 4 minute quest?... do you mean the imposter sheepsquatch event maybe?...
---
I believe Bethesda should change it to how it works when your on a team for events. If I'm at whitesprings and my team kills shit without me I can still loot them. Same could be for events as well just lose out on the exp for the kill
---
Wouldn't leave me link it kept telling me this subreddit is for text only believe me I tried I'll just stick it in the comments😂

Classic BGS polish lmao
---
Oh god no! That’s a bug waiting to happen, I would be worried I’d lose something, there’s still the thing where your fav wheel can’t cope if you have 2 of the same weapon e.g I had an instigating Weston revolver favourited and had a mutant western revolver drop for me, even though it’s not favourited the mutant one shows as the favourite on the wheel. I saw a post the other day that said someone had put a weapon in the grinder and it showed on the right that it should have been the weapon scrapped for scrip but when the guy came out his fav weapon had gone and the one he wanted scrapping was still in his inventory. As soon as I saw that post  I started unfavouriting the weapons that are similar to what I want to scrip and pop them in my stash so there’s no way the scrip machine can access them. I may be being over cautious but I have trust issues lol
---
Good to know. Thank you!
---
\^ \^ And there you have it, exactly the kind of immature attitude that the OP is talking about, well done, thanks for visiting us from Fortnite.
---
This is a very good idea.
---
Did you rush the kill? By that I mean did the legendary just spawn and you immediately killed it. 
---
Sometimes the server is slow and doesnt make the mob legendary immediately. If you kill it during this time you don't get legendary loot. I always let legendaries spawn completely and go through their green glowing routine before killing them
---
This would be such an awesome thing! I want this more than new songs added.
---
That is brilliant, and chance you could do a shirt video or some pics of the inside? And vending?
---
Same lol
---
I would love a legendary flaregun. I carry it and binoculars everywhere since I first found them.
---
pretty sure tesla explosive are legacy..dont know why they arent mentioned in bethesda notes
---
This^
---
Do you mean “Diner”?
---
Thanks, I've also got a clever action rifle with a 10% dmg increase while mutated, if I've got that equipped and go in pip boy and go down the weapons every other gun shows 10% increased damage, it's like the weapons I have equipped effect what the stats read for the other weapons i look at, its very off putting, it seems to do it looking in shops and so on aswell. I've never noticed this until now.
---
I attempted the event a few times and was hard crashed every time... XBox 1x player with excellent internets...
---
I think if Beth can tone down the respawns, and I can learn the ropes without crashing, I would enjoy this event.
---
The Token idea is certainly a good one to continue as it's established throughout the game world that automated rewards were part of daily life. I read a poster at Camden Park referring to 'Work a Day Tokens' and liked the idea behind it.
---
I feel at my level (240) that it's almost my responsibility to help out in events and I do so when I catch them on the map and for this Event I think it's Essential that we receive a Server Wide notification.
---
Great ideas OP, and I will try as a Player to do my best to help this event succeed as long as I don't crash to my home screen! :)
---
*bangs head on wall* yes.......yes I do -.-
---
Yep I agree. I always let others get a tag on the legendaries even if they didn't do any work.
---
It's amazing that people laugh at the idea of chracters actually being unique in some way. That shows just how colossal of a failure this game is in terms of being an RPG that everyone who cares about that sort of thing just isn't here anymore.
---
Only if you have pacifist on.
---
It's not you it's them
---
Ah so that’s what happened this morning lol 😂
---
It's a serial radio drama...the location and atmosphere will matter as the season evolves. Don't skip it.
---
Have you tried planning a couple spot lights? I once had an issue with sniping enemies so I placed two spot lights and it helped my situation.
---
Slap damage doesn't exist anymore.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
His grammar and comprehension 🤭
---
I just did it 10 minutes ago.
---
That's right...I always run pacifist
---
What about a gusty running the show with his maniger a mr handy interrupting him now and then also he should interview robots like BIV and the assaultrons from arktos pharma the daylay robot news from a robots perspective like if white springs resort get nuked a protectron from white spring resort and should call in and report and random robots reporting how vault 76 is a safe zone
---
Build guide please? 😂
---
Bash legendary, let others tag it, kill it. Or switch to a weaker gun.
---
Why does it have to be one or the other?
---
Only problem I see if then you’d have campers just waiting until everything is dead just to loot bodies and do nothing to save ammo or because they are to low level to contribute. It’s kind of annoying when people do what’s talked about but I’d rather than then a bunch of freeloaders showing up.
---
If you say so dude ;), as long as everything's cool
---
Rip I'm sorry for never seeing this my guy
---
Oh, damn that's what it's for? Every time I've gone into Arktos it's been a clusterfuck, so I never knew you could heal them, but I did get Formula P as a reward (or a creature drop, not sure).
---
I'd rather freeloaders and get my loot than freeloaders preventing me from loot, especially if I worked towards the objective and they didn't.
---
Because California is 2300 miles away from West Virgina.

---
You have a 75% chance to take 15% less damage. Exactly what it says. Your character cannot be moving.
---
Idk what would you think is a "long pew" ?
---
That’s because I have all the god tier stuff lol, I’m also a bloodied build I use a dragon for pvp mostly so I one shot everyone regardless of armor. Use sneak to your advantage and prioritize all the bloodied perks like serendipity and nerd rage, add mutations like twisted muscles and adrenal reaction. Learn to stack effects to get op dmg. With our build you need unyielding and as you said you use melee so you have to have a lot of strength so invest in barbarian and you’ll have wicked damage resist with that along with unyielding sentinel. I’m a ranged build so I stack all that, I stack a crit with a sneak attack and easily I’m doing 1500 base dmg add a sneak that’s 2.5 x that 1500, add psychotats, add a crit headshot. Grind legendaries, legendary items you don’t want put it in that machine thing then take your chances at the purveyor but save your scrips till you get to level 50 because I have no clue if the purveyor will give you stuff below max level so grind and save em for now and when you get level 50 spend that scrip. There’s a lot to take into account but I hope this helps. Sure I die but I win most fights and learn from them as well mostly from the ones I lose. Like don’t 1v2 a melee build and a heavy build in a train station lol. Also for melee capitalize on armor penetration you can get your armor penetration up to ridiculous amounts
---
Bruh. They have super mutants and BoS here with the SAME equipment they will use in 200 years during Fallout 4.
---
Lore doesn't matter to them. It's just a pride thing. Beth has never been fair to the west coast Fallouts and they always go out of their way to side line them.
---
No it doesn’t
---
Not no damage.
---
I don’t want freeloaders coming to a SBQ fight making her more difficult and possibly not able to kill just because they want free (without the work) loot. 
---
Sorry, not sorry
---
I don't have those unlocked, but I'm pretty sure connecting them to a terminal opens up more customization options.
---
This could be something that bethesda can add small pieces each patch. I think all of these sugestions puts a lot of extra weight on the developers that works on fixing bugs and glitches since that is one of the main priorities before adding small extra content like this
---
Edit *one shot MOST everyone* lol
---
Hold start and select their name and join them
---
Except the game isn't actually built around being able to form these groups. Unless you have a bunch of friends on call, are on a server with a high population of high level characters that both notice the event and care about it or blindly send invites to people and hope they stick you aren't going to have the manpower to even clear the lowest objective if even that.
---
You can buy the power fist plan from one of the vendors at whitesprings, you can get the mods from scrapping them
---
Not sure about the dcg though
---
In previous challenges, nothing even counted as an alien anyway, so good luck
---
It is, but in this game at least they tend to reserve 308 "mostly" to non automatic weapons so they limit drop quantity. 
---
If they made the handmade use 308 it would be more accurate, doubt they'd appropriately buff damage, but you'd be heavily self reliant on ammo crafting to be viable.
---
I'd say I killed it around 1 to 1 and a half minutes after it spawned.
---
I guess that makes sense though... everything in this game is slow to load.. lol.
---
I haven't tried it yet, but the black prospectors hat looks like it would fit well.
---
Lol fun king should have called me out for that
---
Again with the play style Nazis telling me what to do. Why should I carry a weaker gun when weight management is such an important feature of this game..  I'm not saying I'm out to prevent you from tagging but I'm so tired of I told how I have to play.
---
1. A good spot in the middle of the map that has water or an extractor or both
---
2. No
---
3.no
---
4. Nowhere in particular 
---
5. Both
---
A gun with a long barrel that goes "PEW PEW PEW"
---
I play solo too, that's no excuse. At an event like, let's uranium fever, I'll be the one that started it, I'll be the one protecting the extractors. 
---
70% of the time someone with a auto explosive weapon comes in and just blows the Legendaries away before anyone else gets a chance to tag it. 
---
No one else is there for the shit rewards, we are all there for the Legendaries. Don't be an asshole. It takes no effort for you to just let someone shoot the legendary before you oneshot it, or for you to just bash it to tag it yourself.
---
But with your original post it is a dick move to one shot things and not give people a chance. I can kill most things like that but when it’s a team event I change to a weapon that can’t. But some people don’t think that way
---
Grab Pandora or Spotify or even YT music, search for fallout playlist. Problem solved. 
---
Also playing it off your phone and not through the game is a more accurate sounding experience since it's supposed to emanate from your pip boy
---
Ahh racism. The finest of humours
---
I don't like this. It will just make it easier for people who cheat to optimize for whatever the newest meta build is
---
They recently nerfed sentinal (75% chanced to take 15% less dmg while standing and not moving) so if you had 5 pieces that'd give you 75% less dmg if every piece went off
---
I only [got](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=225096419) 63 drops since P9.5, of which 5 2\* and 2 3\* items. It's too early to conclude a nerf yet but drop rates have been decreasing slowly for me in the past 3 months.
---
This is the fix I've been using. It does work!!
---
It does! Never seen it's idle walk animation?
---
I also just did it
---
The legendaries at uranium fever are level capped so...yeah...you are there for shit rewards.
---
They need to tie the legendary to the successful completion of the event and not the end boss so everyone gets something, personally I have no problem if someone wants to storm in and one shot if it means the event completes, I’d rather have a possible possom badge than a cr@ppy legendary, same with the Sheepsquatch, I’m more than happy to see a glass cannon sweep in and give the Sheepsquatch what for, there’s lots of legendaries out there but a lot of event rewards are unique and I’d rather have them. I was so excited to complete project paradise this morning I completely forgot to loot the legendary fog crawler and went off to pick flowers lol
---
Haha no was some thing you can build at a camp
---
Nah. I think that is working as it should. Wear a different hat.
---
The camp owner gave me a thumbs down and grr face. I try to break into locked camps just for fun
---
The only one I’ve gotten to level 3 is the deer but sometimes they don’t respawn either xx
---
I set mine at 15-25 caps. 50 if its somewhat rarer like bos combat armor. (I know vendors sell them again but if a player comes along they get them for under half price)
---
Stimpacks at 10 caps. Full fusion cores at 50. 
---
Just enough for my travel costs. Quite fair i think as i see lots of prople going a bit overboard with prices and generally people that buy such items are lower level or maybe dont have much time to play so are not swimming in caps.
---
Some guy bought 110 stimpacks that i was selling, probably was gonna resell them, or is really bad at the game. Good luck to him. 15-20 mins of harvesting some tick blood crafted another 60. So its not as if its hard for higher level players to get a hold of, thus no need for 25-35 caps each.
---
Ill have to mod it tonight for a stinging mag :)
---
I was hoping for something in the middle, as with the drum at 85 I barely reload, but everything is dead within a few shots anyway. So if I can get 20 ish per mag with stinging ill be happy
---
Exactly. I can too, but I don't.
---
Have people who see these missions pop up never hear of playing with a friend or hell, even message a stranger. 
---
Photo missions usually are designed to force you to work with someone else. Do that, and most are pretty simple. 
---
This one in particular might be annoying if they haven't fixed the flatwoods bug though I also think it further pushes the belief that actual aliens will be in game at some point too.
---
There's no reason to report it on reddit at all. Bethesda has a bug reporting tool on their site.
---
MODUS could hijack the station from time to time and play patriotic music.
---
Because people would accidentally press it and cry when all their &lt;valuable_resource&gt; was instantly lost
---
I miss three dog
---
I would love to spend my all money to Atom Shop. Bethesda please add something, anything to the Atom Shop that we can be bought it with real money!  Maybe even collaborate with Spotify so we could buy all songs separately from Atom Shop just for fun!
---
I love super mutants they have caps - In your situation I would rebuild my camp specifically defend against them. 
---
1. I wouldnt build rocket turrets - if the turrets kill them you cant loot them. walls walls walls. the big tall concrete ones. I am tanky with gatling laser so i would just jump over and shoot them- if I were not tanky with a different build I would adjust the camp to compensate ie sniper hides if I was a sniper lots of corners if i was melee etc.
---
Even worse is all new content! Anything not in the release version is taking far far longer to appear in the world
---
Yes exactly this lmao
---
Thanks for these valuable informations. I'll keep these in mind.
---
If you ever do Uranium Fever or any other legendary-spawning event with experienced players, you'll find they'll actually call out legendaries on area chat or by using the "come here" emote.  After everyone tags it with some low damage, someone will kill it and everyone gets loot.
---
And yet... every once in a while there's some dipshit that doesn't understand this and kills everything as soon as they see it.
---
I think the Flatwood Monster is counted as 'Alien' :o
---
No. Don't blame solo players for bad design choices. The issue here is that loot and such should be shared at events, even if you dont tag a mob, as long as you participate in the event you should get loot.
---
Yes, im well aware this would enable leeching, but to be fair atleast it would even the playing field and help more people than it'd hurt in the end, imo. Leeching already happens except its mostly legendary mobs that people tag and afk again.
---
i run a vatsbuild, when i have to protect a bloatfly i accidently oneshot legendary mobs on occassion because i run a sneak build ontop of it, for those who ended up not tagging the mob, im sorry. i don't do it on purpose and always switch to my Lv40 tesla rifle when legendary mobs are around and theres multiple people at an event.
---
:(
---
Honestly, I have my front door locked. I have an indoor garden for my own personal crops and I grow a bunch more outside, along with some purifiers for public use.
---
The whole indoor garden thing is cool, but I feel like it is just too much effort to protect something that will likely have grown back by the time I return home anyway.  I may as well just leave the door unlocked and think of something else to do with the garden. I wish I could plant flowers and stuff. Also pumpkins. I really wish I could grow pumpkins. I'm rambling.
---
What's the difference to how it currently works? They hop in, tag her and wait. In the proposed system they hop in and wait. I don't think not requiring the tagging changes anything about freeloading SBQ.
---
Yass. The radio feels so bland w/o a DJ to interrupt the songs to speak
---
People like DCG with SS is nice. Bloodied is preferred but I bet you could get at least 5k out of that one. As for the sword I’m unsure.
---
So the developers of this game determined explosive laser weapons to be so wrong they have stopped providing them.
---
They have also decided to leave in the game the limited number that are already in the possession of the player base.
---
So it gives the impression that the developers favor the few that have these weapons over the rest of the player base. 
---
It really doesn't matter if  the developers have a good reason for not completing their 'removal' of the problematic component of the game because the end result is severely handicapping the majority and giving 'god' status to the lucky few is the 'reality'.
---
I'd like to see them change it so when you die in Survival you drop everything you had on you. That would make the equipment that exists available to everyone and the elite with the great get would be the ultimate 3 star targets!
---
They would break Interplay/obsidian lore even more. NCR was founded in 2186.
---
The survival mode reward for the week starting June 4th is a 3* Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet called “unstoppable monster” 40% more power attack damage 40% less damage taken when blocking, so if you don’t find one before June 4th there’s always that one
---
I don't think you can add achievements to a game.  However, I think you can add DLC to a game's acheivment/trophy list and bring a list of new trophies there.
---
Modus knows when a nuke launches he says we felt that warhead above or something like that
---
Isn't it funny how I'm the asshole for learning how to play the game and do new events but all of you are just fine for doing the opposite showing up to said events and mostly being the cause of why they fail?? Thumbs up dude!
---
The most I have seen there were four plus me. I soloed one area from stage 1 to 3 and in the end my guy was still alive.
---
One time there were three plus me and one of the others was level 4 guy.
---
I mean that'd be useful but everytime I'm trying to join a horde event i don't see any horde
---
I had no idea about that, thanks for the heads up!
---
It means make a text post (like you did here) and put the link in the body of the text post.
---
Did you buy the extra claw plan from a player vendor?
---
no, you would just get a regular non-legendary flare gun instead of a legendary item after killing a legendary enemy. you can still get a non-legendary drill or non-legendary syringer
---
I think they should make it so that if you’re running the event with the team actively, you get to loot the boss. Some people run builds that make it difficult to tag an enemy without one hitting it.
---
What's the difference between grinding an event a dozen times before you get the specific drop you want and grinding an event a dozen times to redeem 12 tokens for the specific item you want?
---
They're great for scrip. Level doesn't matter
---
Carry weight is an issue? Seriously?
---
As a non PA user my carry weight is ~300 and my multiple weapons (Rifle, shotgun, heavy weapon, shovel, deathclaw), armor, chems and two PA sets come to about 150 for me.
---
You enjoy it, that's your opinion. Stop posting your opinion.
---
It does stack per pellet, hence why it's always been so good on shotguns. The issue is people are relying on just the explosive damage and not the actual pellet impact, by spraying at the ground, and then complain that the gun doesn't do much damage
---
Realistically, the full drop wont happen on survival by itself. But... but there is another thing we might actually achieve if we unite our voice for this purpose. Hardcore survival mode - single character slot separate from rest of gamemodes - no mules. No legendary items besides those named ones - quest rewards and challange rewards, no legendary loot whatsoever from RNG, so that legendaries would really be legendary. Full loot drop upon death so that well prepared players have few crafted armor sets and weapons they stash. Completely different meta - not minmax builds, but maximum efficiency builds - the cheapest powerful one. Different playstyle, where noone wastes ammo on trash mobs and everybody uses both melee and ranged to survive, and where you only take four-five magazines of ammo when you head out. No mules, hence twice the stash size to make it managable.
---
and yet actual developers at a big company like Bethesda didn't even think about any of this. Like it never even crossed their minds.
---
So you say, it technically not possible to add new achievements the way they do it? Might actually  be the reason....
---
I was kinda on the fence at first, but if this was an option I'd be all in.
---
I miss the Enclave radio eyebots with Yankee Doodle and Eden's voice popping in.
---
how much for deathclaw gauntlet?
---
All good advice will definitely take it into account, I don't enjoy PVP so I mostly avoid other players.
---
Turn pacifist on and don't get sucked into joining a team "to trade" or "cos I am glitched" (then use their lurking buddy to engage a fight and your base is then open to damage)
---
If someone air strikes or artillery strikes your gaff... log out and in and all damage is repaired.
---
Got mine from a static spawn in the train car West of Watoga Train station, on top of a barrel by the side door. (Same spot also spawns BOS plans for armor and under armor, great stuff!)
---
Watch out for 2 assaultrons patrolling the nearby sidewalk who will sense you even crouched and stealthy.
---
Have also gotten the wetsuit plans from looking safes and from treasure maps.
---
I only do taht cuz im pure evil
---
It's not an available option through the terminal but you could probably accomplish it with the power counter pylon or something like that.
---
I won a plan last night that said domestic table. I was just curious as to what it would look like, looked it up in the game, and found almost 25 things labeled table. Couldnt see anything that pointed to what i had just learned.
---
It needs to be Biv
---
I'll have to check this out, thank you my friend.
---
Thanks, checking that next time I'm on.
---
I'm not contradicting myself on spawns because I'm talking about two wildly different situations. The lack of spawns specifically concerns the event enemies thats only spawn during the first stage while the sudden respawning of the entire dungeon is a repopulation system triggered when someone new enters the dungeon.
---
Also this isn't Free Range where the defense target and boss are in sight of each other all the time. If the boss spawns in A and you're defending something in C you can't do both at the same time.
---
Eventually Bethesda will nerf some favorite weapons to the ground so people need to respec everything again. Bethesda won't give any free respecs like they do in other games if something is changed.
---
I’ll take a bloodied faster fire rate drill please
---
They gave a believable(albeit unlikely) explanation to the bos and mutants, because we never actually knew when the bos formed they could get away with it, and the mutants fev things has already been just stretched out and tossed all over the country at this point that the thing about all of it being brought to the base in fallout 1 isn’t really a thing anymore, the ncr however definitely took like 100 years before it was even conceived, not to mention “new California republic”, not much sense to be in Appalachia
---
It's the only thing really keeping me from saying Radio Appalachia is my favourite radio station, as the soundtrack is *tight*. As a fan of old school jazz and the like I was hyped to hear Fats Waller being included, and Mr 5 by 5 and Two Left Hands are the epitome of the sorta sound I like in Fallout.
---
Just such a shame we don't have a Three Dog-like personality to give it all that much needed flavour. Maybe if Wastelanders does repopulate WV like the rumours say we could still get an actual host to it, and to be honest an eccentric robot would really fit the whole automation theme that flows with the game.
---
Adventure, but others have suggested pacifist, it was on but I'll have to check, on PC and I did delete the ini files recently, my fault by the looks of it.
---
Strangely I've only crashed twice so far. Other than that killed the boss with random strangers a dozen times. Didn't see anything need to be improved other than the mediocre loot, but honestly compared to all the wood and drill I got from the Assaultron sheep in the beginning, it's not too bad at all. Best so far is a quad pump shotty with faster fire rate. Definitely Not a failure or need to be savaged. 
---
I did see some lower level players attempt to melee the boss and end up dying a lot. Use ranged heavy weapon you'll kill them quick and safe.
---
Thanks I'll check my pacifist mode is one, I'm now  suspicious it is off. I'm sure it was on on :)
---
I didn't mind it when it was for kills because the people who want to hunt players down could and if they have the most kills they probably want to pvp. But now with the new survival points you end up on the top 3 just from playing the game normally then the guy who has an explosive two shot runs up behind you and kills you no matter where you are. The even more terrible thing is that those guy have plenty of caps so they just ft anywhere on map you are and kill you. Yesterday I had a guy spawn on the event I was doing just to sit there and wait till I completed it just to kill me. The chart just gives griefers a tool to grief with.
---
Yeaaah. It's only that one window that this works on.
---
Then it was just hitting me as an invitation to PVP or they were just messing with me.
---
Keeps inflation under control
---
That's not what I'm talking about. The entire dungeon respawning is not tied to the event, it's a repopulation system that triggers when someone enters the dungeon after enough time has oassed. It respawns everything in the dungeon simultaneously including any of the original creatures, ghouls and robots.
---
Yeah this frustrates me too would love it if the date actually moved as we played
---
Bet you can't find a single piece of software without a bug.
---
Good idea. I'd like a robot DJ who plays songs and occasionally radio plays like the Silver Shroud and Tales from Appalachia etc. That would be super cool. He could give weather and traffic reports, too. The important thing is to make sure the radio station doesn't get repetitive too quickly. I can rarely stand to have Appalachia Radio on for more than an hour.
---
Just please don't make the robot as annoying as Rose.
---
If you are on PC I can mod it for you. You wished me a good day in an other discussion, now I'd be happy to make your day better :)
---
That doesn't solve the problem. These aren't respawns tied to the event, they're part of the games repopulation system that kicks in when someone new enters a dungeon after enough time has passed.
---
Yah in patch 9 they said the Animal Friend perk Scorch Beasts can no longer be pacified, but nothing about them for Wasteland Whisperer. Again I could be wrong, but I haven’t been able to and hope they bring it back.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
Good information TY
---
I love using the environment with my builds, I'm using one of the picnic areas in the Forest as mine. Not as nice as this one so I might go surveying to find a new one... You've inspired me!

I can speak to everyother mmo out there and yes... We are entitled to a respec. Most games give you an item which you can use at you choosing for a respec... After words if you want more its standard to charge high end currency. 
---
For most this means grind. But yes, it is standard in the mmo world.
---
The sword is decent its AA makes it good. The Gauntlet is pretty impressive with the swing speed and damage per hit but it wont work with your PA build because you wont be able to equip fist weapons.
---
Very useful thanks! The point is though that I shouldn’t need to use a 3rd party website to play the game efficiently
---
The game already breaks lore in many ways. I thought we were already in agreement that this is a spin-off game that's not canon.
---
We have the radium rifle, which is supposed to be a weapon modified by the CoTA two hundred years after this game. 
---
The scorched plague being localized exclusively to west virginia doesn't make any sense given how incredibly contagious it is. Just listen to the holotapes and read the entries at the morgantown airport; this was almost another apocalyptic event. 
---
The introduction of cargobots to be so prevalent in the game is kind of an issue if they don't exist anywhere else. There is an infinite amount of them giving you hundreds of government supply boxes, but then for some reason they are all gone when the next fallout game starts? Even though vertibirds are still about?
---
The lack of humans is completely ridiculous within fallout canon. In previous games, you have people like moira brown who essentially survive direct nuclear explosions. You have a ghoul who survived inside of a fridge. Many of the towns you come across are amazing survival stories of people pushing through the tiniest of odds. And now you're telling me these red little fucks that can't even take out a super mutant could wipe out ALL of them?
---
Similar to the previous point, a complete lack of anybody coming into the state is ridiculous; you meet plenty of people in the earlier games who travel around the country to start a new life or explore the wasteland or find people to help. Nobody, not a single living soul, decides to enter this huge state and is capable of surviving more than a few days?
---
I can't remember anything specific for this right now, but I'm 99% sure that there are some lore-breaking explanations for MODUS and the current enclave system in west virginia. Same with the brotherhood, it doesn't necessarily fit in with the canon.
---
Nice! When I was hitting the point where I didn’t want to just grab every piece I saw in the wild anymore, I just wrote a checklist of which parts I needed to complete the partial sets I had left, so if I came across a piece, I’d check my checklist. If it wasn’t on it, I left it alone (or grabbed and vendored it).
---
The game cant handle that. It already thinks its a piece of broccoli and not a game engine.
---
I need that!
---
How much.
---
Clickbate sounds interesting though...
---
It doesn’t matter, the event specifically is for groups. MMOs do this all the time. Content for solos and some for groups. This is for groups.
---
I own almost ever plan in the game. Ask me in the encyclopedia.
---
This 100%. Bosses are supposed to be bullet sponges, period. Those alphas are nowhere near as tanky as the queen.
---
If you have the launcher open and logged in, it autologs you in. If you don’t have the launcher open, it asks for login. I assume the new option works the same; if not I’ll have to investigate how it logs you in.
---
Every mmo has high level only group content. This is for those who have leveled appropriately. Every single one. All content isn’t for everyone. Casuals have plenty to do otherwise
---
... makes me think of other peoples' dirty, sticky mice and keyboards.
---
It's not that that standard, not to the extent that pooling all of your special points and getting to repic everything is, that's like switching classes in an mmo - not many MMOs let you completely switch classes
---
I will be the wasteland DJ for free, got nothing better going on really
---
Why can’t you? It’s Fireproof, right there in endurance. Combine that with Dense Torso mod and explosives become irrelevant.
---
I'm not certain but I think you can reduce the wire placement jumping issue be placing the tiny cursor in the middle of the object receiving the wire. Having it highlight in green is not enough. Need to do some more tests though.
---
That's actually a great idea.
---
*"Reports of a large creature making sheep sounds and attacking folk in the Ash Heap!"*
---
Encryptid event is on.
---
*"Some loud sounds coming from Arktos, what on earth is going on?"*
---
Ok that event is on. I'll head over.
---
*"Seems very quiet at Berkley today. Somebody might want to make use of the lead there!"*
---
Oh, the workshop isn't taken? I'll grab that now.
---
Works with basically anything they want to announce or encourage us to do. Could even initiate events. 
---
*"Can somebody get a photo of a Mirelurk Queen? We're having a... disagreement here about their colour."* take a photo to do the quests.
---
I think it's fine as it is. I already have enough crap to scroll through to find what I want to sell without everything in my stash also being put on the list. Every legendary exchange machine in the game has a stash box within like 15 feet of it, so you can just withdraw whatever you wanted to sell
---
That reminds me, has the Appalachia Radio playlist been tweaked lately?  Seems there are songs I'm not hearing lately that I know were played regularly before...
---
We all miss Three Dog. :/ I still will never forget his wisdom.. "Don't feed the Yao Guai."
---
If you tune in after an update it should announce the updates, for example if they add something such as Laser Muskets, the bot should say"
---
"Boston based laser muskets have begun to spread across Appalachia"
---
or even change it up a bit like if they added pistols like the Deliverer, the voice could say,
---
"The railroad rats have begun to infect Appalachia with their arsenal of weaponry and armour alike, the borders are being threatened by railroad synths but are being taken care of by our defenders. Hail the Enclave!"
---
This could bring in more factions, and even events or just the occurence where you'll find Enclave bots fighting Synths, in future they could even bring in the NCR and much more!
---
In today’s news 01010011 01011101 01110010
---
Give us Three Dog!
---
A long wooden bench with no cushion on the seat but potentially ones attached to the back that fold down for prayer.  Pews are found in churches.
---
Death claw gauntlets are ridiculous with the extra claw + Instigating. I'm full melee non-PA and my first hit does something like 700dmg, and 40% swing speed + Martial Artist just makes the rest of the hits absurd. Put that baby in your vending machine, they're def OP for melee builds.
---
Hey are you still playing fallout 76?
---
You could give every player a million dollars and there would still be this guy, being a wanker
---
Totally agree, it must have been suggested on here thousands of times, hopefully bethesda decides to do something about the tedious perk card system soon.
---
I guess everyone missed mine :(  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bs8zqd/a_mr_handy_radio_dj_for_appalachia/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

He's linked to the silos I believe, just cant do anything without the permission from the general. Hence why he needs you
---
I like your number 6, I feel you should make a post just on a Token reward system (for everything, have one for the Forest where I can earn a rare outfit, ash-heap, tech data turn in, etc)
---
Its not a gun lol
---
I never noticed until someone brought it up.  Doesn't bother me.
---
The joke is that, long pew sounds like a gun..
---
Except those factions wont exist for another 200 odd years but I get where you are coming from.
---
They can, Minecraft adds new Achievements with every major update. I keep having to re 100% it.
---
My vending machines
---
I was thinking about that. Would be cool if fallout had some classes. Like thief gets lock pick passively on all times (when unlocked and cards picked) and some bonuses to stealth. And then penaltys to big weapons and maybe PA. So this character is always going to be light and fast and not just switch some cards to be all the sudden good at automatic rifles. Then you throw in a quest to find your self around lvl 35 and change up to what you may want to be moving forward.
---
This rough idea could allow for more individualized builds and allow for more new and unique cards. I love cards like cannibal and good doggy. Wish there was more like them.
---
So multiple chatacters is still a thing... But changing up you build inside of a class could also be a thing.
---
It can't work without penaltys tho. Thats the fun chose your path kinda thing that would be very cool in This game.
---
I can’t believe no one suggested the grafton mayor as host! Who wouldn’t want to hear his voice all day
---
Some people say, that they could even hear Big Iron on the radio, back when the game first came out. Maybe Bethesda had to remove a few tracks, due to expiring rights.
---
This is probably hands down the best idea I've seen posted so far, it's something simple , easy and absolutely everyone would love and use it
---
I see a lot of people saying it isn't. But I don't see anyone claiming to have looted one since patch 5.
---
Oh yeah!
---
Man I was very pleased with how well this goes with headgear. I wear a BOS Hood w mine
---
"Keep an eye on those Geiger counters, kiddies. Tick-tick-ticketty means run your ass outta there."
---
My brother and I had taken Granton steel and we were both well under level 50, this person came up at 167 and contested it. We ended up killing them together only for them to come back with 3 of their 150+ friends and murdering us. It's made worse by the fact that they owned every workshop on the server so we just left. I thought it was pretty funny that they needed their friends help to kill some low level peps just trying to get resources.

Nope.  You can go elsewhere for that.   I owe you nothing.

It's a bench. And i need it.

I've done the event a few times now , me and one of my buddies. We came up with sort of a strategy. We go for the kelp. Seems to respawn better .i can get a little more than thirty myself ,so does my friend . With one level 3 creature we take turns tanking for the friendly while the others aggros the alpha beast . We failed a couple times , but we have passed a few more than we've failed. Seems legit hard , but fun as hell. I've started hanging out in there a lot. Farming the bots until the event restarts . Only leaving every now and then to go make bullets. With 6 people I feel confident we can get all three friendly creatures to survive. It will be tough , 9 players would be optimal , 6 could get by, 2 can succeed with at least one level 3 friendly. We wanted difficult and we got it, I found a new home in game. Also just happens to be very close to my camp so it's almost free to travel.
---
Never seen the camp fire event pop up ever and I’m on most days since release, any idea on why shooting radstag etc with syringer it doesn’t say to kill?
---
Yes, but I won't be on for about an hour.  Gt is same as here but without underscore
---
I can wear the green hood with it and one of my friends can wear another hat but I don’t know about helmets. Which helmet are you talking about? I would assume that if it doesn’t cover your face it should work.
---
Grinding for tokens is a guaranteed ROI.  Grinding for a drop, it may take a dozen times, it may drop the second time, you may be at it for months.
---
Why?
---
What do you have to do to "contest a workshop"? As I have not done it myself...
---
Added and *removed*, if something stops being relevant entirely.
---
Yep. My handle is moist4skins 
---
(Not a joke)
---
Deathclaw gauntlet is a very good drop.  Don't sell it cheap.
---
The AA sword is a meh. It's sellable but not really better than a 1* AA sword.
---
As long as they add a "are you sure" screen hopefully that could be avoided
---
Just gotta add a confirmation screen and should be able to avoid that
---
She blinded me!
---
Oh I meant open headgear in the general sorry. It's a top hat like hat.
---
Yeah. I think if more people understood how good it is, I wouldn't have 2 1* instigating deathclaw gauntlets in my vending stock.
---
Thank you for the answer :D!
---
The problem is the easiness of making one hit builds. When designing this game the BGS never understood the cleverness of players to combine different bonuses for min/max play style.
---
Most common one hit style is a bloodied builds.
---
Bloodied by itself is not OP. Problem comes when it is added with mutations, chems, armor, alcohol, food and drinks and not to mention if player is also stealthed and headshotting.
---
There should be a max limit on bonuses, getting a bonus of +1000% on damage or more is just idiotic design.
---
If one hit wonders were taken out and the stacking of bonuses up to infinity were made impossible, the problem would not be. And those players could be the scumbags and a-holes that they are in RL.
---
My solution? Freeloaders = Human Shields
---
They may conserve ammo but I'm going to keep putting them between me and the enemy.
---
What happens if you got a platinum trophy?
---
It should work then. I’ve used just about all of the atom shop headwear with it and my friend uses a bowler hat.
---
Excellent that you still have it. mine happened when I was attacked by a ghoul right as I was making the purchase. I thought I dropped it somehow but found it later.
---
I try to avoid mods since it's unclear what Bethesda will or won't consider a violation of TOS. Admittedly we haven't heard of any bans for modding lately but I'm just not willing to risk it.
---
That could work, make people actually think maybe they should check what they have.
---
What price do you have then going for?
---
Just pulled a 3\* two shot with +50% DR while aiming and +40% bashing damage. I think it might get fed to the grinder, or am I missing something?
---
I'm just now really starting to figure out all the perks (yeah I'm slow with all that), but seeing you two talk about the damages and builds with it will definitely make me keep an eye out for that gauntlet and try it out.
---
BIV is frequently unintelligible and an abject lesson in the need for moderation! A Gutsy in full patriotic military fervour would make for an amusing show.
---
Less than the vendors. 250 or so, I think.
---
I got repeated items, repeated effects and both at the same time when I turned in all my scrips (1\* ranged).  There is a short term preferentiality in the random legendary drops, which the Purveyor seems to use too, therefore, I'd say if you get something good, keep spending scrips to get variations. If you get a few bads, stop, get rid of the items and try again the next day on a different server so the game forgets those boosted bad items/effects.
---
This problem is not player related. It is game design related. Focus your anger to right direction. In this case it is Bethesda's bad game design.
---
Could be that 1* is so common now ppl scroll right passed. Idk about anyone else but when I'm going through ppls shops I only look for 3*s and then see what the weapon is.
---
This is the best idea I’ve heard about event notification and what not!
---
Ok, I can get on board with this.  But do you want them to make your 5k rounds of ammo a realistic weight as well?
---
Motherfucker act like they forgot about Biv.
---
It can get Casual lining mods, but that's it.
---
Cool. Give me a heads up when you log in.
---
"And pop some radaway to be safe!"
---
crashing twice is a LOT
---
So rather than be part of the solution, you become the problem..." because Bethesda let's me "...  lame.
---
I was robbed of a legendary last night during campfire tales when a what my friend calls "A Blammer" appeared and one shotted the legendary radscorpion, resulting in no legendaries for anyone or everyone! :l
---
Don’t listen to them just keep smashing stuff.
---
I get the joke but I also don’t think many people know what pews are.
---
I love this idea!  You could show the color or Karma designation on the leaderboards as well as on the map whenever you're highlighted.  They added a tab for Legendary script to your Pip Boy status - they could do something similiar for Karma as well.  Even better would be a periodic on-screen message and music to announce how your Karma has changed since the last check in, somewhat similar to what we saw in Fallout 3.  I think this would really help differentiate the Survival Mode vs. Adventure.
---
Excellent suggestion!
---
It's pretty simple. There are roughly 5 good primary effects to make a build around. Bloodied and AA are across the board useful on weapons. Instigating is best on slow heavy hitters ( snipers rifles and slow melee). Furious and vampires are best on fast hitting weapons (miniguns, lmgs, knives, etc). Build wise, you cater to the type of weapons you use and whether or not you run a low health high rad Unyielding build (best with bloodied and vampire).
---
It does update, but resets whenever you load it up again.
---
That video was fantastic!
---
Things have improved, yes.
---
I’m absolutely terrible at aiming too and spent the first few hours playing without VATS because they felt weird to me. Now though I heavily use VATS and can do a decent job doing some support killing with a whole lot of head shots.
---
The perks that cripple limbs are very, very helpful to me too - they let me slow down the fight. I’m a rifle build but I carry around a shotgun and equip the enforcer perk (level 1) when I need to cripple a tough enemy (I find the level 1 shotgun version of the perk works more consistently than level 1 of the rifle one.) I honestly can’t believe that I can solo a level 80 Scorchbeast with very little effort and almost no dying!  It’s not pretty but I can do it.

Yes it works!! Thanks man:).

Looks awesome!

When you send out twenty invites your bound to get one
---
Lots of players build great, open, welcoming CAMPs. They want visitors and I’m happy to spend my caps there. I try to buy something from those places no matter what, even if it’s just something little and dumb. 
---
If I get to a CAMP that’s all locked down with just vendors outside, I usually don’t even bother to look. That person clearly doesn’t want me there, so I’ll be happy to go away—along with my caps. 
---
I don’t need access to everything, but basic things like workbenches and a stash box should be considered standard amenities for wasteland retail.
---
Well, I used mods since the initial release of the game and made numerous other ones myself. Thousands of downloads in almost half a year without a single ban report from anyone. And I monitor all my mod's comments sections carefully every day. It's not an ad, all I wanted to say is that it's pretty safe to use mods atm.
---
No problem. Glad it worked 👍
---
I think you are correct the people have changed mostly for the better. The game still has lots of bugs and crashes. But I’ve experienced a lot more of a friendly vibe, people willing to work together or share adventures. Even to the extent of sharing on the kill of legendary creatures.
---
Played it for the last 3 days to test the fix for graphical bug which was permanently presented in my game (fixed by changing Bethesda.net language, wtf is with this game, seriously)
---
I'd be content if they offered more non-combat ways to complete quests.  I get it, very few MMOs do that, and I guess I should be happy I can stealth through these at all, but it would have been nice if I could stealth and lock pick my way to get into certain areas.  But again, with the grouping it could make thins too easy. 
---
People request respec abilities beyond the tweaking, and people asking for builds.  There is no question that Bethesda has heard people, and I wonder if they are holding off for some of the other content coming from the road map
---
For example, from their original post: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
&gt;New Feature: Legendary Players – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
They may be holding off on some of these requests to bundle it in with Legendary Players. Giving the benefit of the doubt, they may be in the process of designing a new UI, looking at balance options, coming up with a quest line/event for respecs, etc.  
---
I'm guessing nothing is said by Bethesda becasue they havent' worked out the details yet and don't want to set false expecations. 
---
wild guess though... I'm going to see how the legendary player works, then see where it goes from there.
---
S'mores was the last piece I needed to finish Backpacker.  Thanks to your video I didn't have to spend much time finding all the glowing resin!
---
Yeah some ppl are douchebags, i (lvl 150) was killed at the fusion core workshop, the guy claimed it, destroyed the fusion core maker and he was just waiting for me  to come and seek revenge. I waited for some time, saw defend event, hopped in and I carefully let the ghouls destroy everything. I bet he was there somewhere watching me with hope i'll claim it from him. Then he logged off. :)
---
Fallout.gamepedia show insulated,treated,protective and shielded mods 😕  But how and where to find that....
---
#SCIENCE!
---
Appreciate the info, I'll start diving into all that.
---
Been suggested since launch, still no change. And people wonder why requests of Bethesda are becoming less polite.
---
Found this out just recently. Hope it’s fixed soon
---
When that happens you might as well server hop. Haven't found a way to unbug it.
---
”It’s been quite a day today in beautiful post-war Appalachia! Earlier this morning, a former resident of Vault 76 fought with another wastelander over control of the Grafton Steel Yard! Looks like he didn’t win though! Oh hang on... this just in, one of the nuclear silos along the mountain range has been activated and a nuclear missile is now en-route to an area south-east of Watoga! For our listeners in Watoga, stay safe and remember to enjoy the weather!
---
Now before we get back to the music, we’d like to make a quick announcement from our sponsor, The Whitesprings Resort: For this weekend only, you can get 30% off a 3 night stay + a free 18 hole round at the Whitesprings golf club! That’s all for now, back to the music!”
---
Honestly those alphas aren't as tough as I expected, I had thought at level 100 they should be as tanky as the queen. I simply run around the feeders or up and down the stairs, only got hit once when I tried to loot a dead Assaultron. I can see why melee players complain though, since they can't one shot the bosses and end up getting hit often. Same with sneak build, when they could one shot most ghouls and mutants, the alphas are costing them more precious ammo.
---
That's a mistake. I am lvl 140 and can one shot most things and kill a mirelurk queen,  scortchbeast, sheepsquatch, non SBQ in under 30 seconds. I only have 1* weapons. There are very few 2* and 3* effects that actually add to a weapons effectiveness overall. I feel that people struggle in this game because they want to jump straight to the top tier of gear rather than buying a middle step to make life easier while they hunt for top end gear.
---
Google "Triggers broom"
---
There you go.   If you do not want PVP, do not take workshops.
---
The difference is you get eyes on your build your pictures your gameplay Etc from the community. I think that's a good thing!
---
Bethesda could never be humble enough to add content from a game that still blows every one of their own Fallout games out of the water
---
That really depends on the event. Uranium Fever? Yeah maybe. Project Paradise or Campfire tales? This approach simply isn't going to work. In first case you are risking you animal and in second you are risking campfire cuz noone ever gives a damn about it. Honestly you shouldn't blame the player here, you should blame the game.
---
I run a bloodied build and when I do the event I up my health so that my weapons don't do as much damage and I don't bring any explosive weapons as I've been told it can affect the animals that we try to protect with splash damage.
---
It's like when I do the sheepsquatch event I keep the robots off the other players so that they can get on with killing it after I've tagged it.
---
r/jesuschristreddit
---
I completely agree with you. If I was just after legendaries I’d go to Wes Tek or WS. I do events for the badges and unique items. I’m more than happy to stay back and protect friendlies or the Brahmin, or whatever to complete the event. Or I’m happy to get in there and kill the alpha or ‘squatch. I will usually tag them quickly, but it’s not my main concern.
---
If you turn off the power to my machines I'll leave the server while you shop.
---
Nobody cuts my power... twice!
---
Only happens if someone picks up the quest item before it has a quest marker on it. Marker then is placed on the item while it's in the player's inventory.
---
So my advice would be not to rush that part of the event and wait for the quest markers to appear on those items before you collect them.
---
Is this a joke? Robot respawns means more xp and potentially more legendaries... isn't that exactly what we've been asking for? Store your youtube-copied explosive junk weapons and make a proper all-round build ffs the robots are weak enough as is.
---
So THAT was what that was.  Thanks!
---
I know the joke, you’re supposed to show me a picture of you with the broom and say “what more proof do you need?”
---
I think you whooshed yourself friend :(
---
That character looks so creepy!
---
I wear mine with the black cowboy hat you can get in the forest from the Alice-in-Wonderland picnic scene AKA the mad hatter table. Looks pretty sick
---
Ideally no crash would be nice. But a few month ago it would crash when I was browsing stash and doing nothing else, twice is already an improvement.
---
Dude that combo looks great! I ran the drift outfit for a while.  The gas masks look great with those but I've never seen it with that hat.  It looks awesome.  Finding new outfit combinations like this is the best part of the game for me sometimes
---
See that's one way to do it!
---
It honestly doesn't bother me. I never notice the date on my pip boy.
---
Sounds like a cool hat! I'm only lvl 12 so I guess I can't go there yet Haha
---
 not sure. don't really know what it's worth
---
How hard is it to just switch to a pistol when other people are near? Most other dwellers I've encountered will do that, but every once in awhile you get that one person that just mows everything down.
---
Yeah, I logged on and a bunch of high level players came over. My first thought was, “great I’m gonna get trolled hard” then they all started dropping stuff and said, “enjoy! Pls keep playing” and walked off. 😝
---
Im working on a list! Suggestions are welcome as well.
---
This picture looks a bit naughty are you sure it had a natural death as the thumbs up make we wounder :)
---
What system are you? If Xbox I’ll pay
---
Thanks,  yep didn't think either fit my build
---
I like Wavy Willard's better because it is more flat and relatively open space with good visibility on the Flash Fern; 270 Raw Violet Flux my best run with Green Thumb.
---
For the Glowing/Hardened/Fluids, I usually nuke Whitesprings for them before nuking Wavy.
---
Your missing the point.
---
He wasn't trying to take the factory, he was cap farming on adventure mode.
---
Lot a hard comments in this thread.. but we need to say this. Out of all the games out there played we have to give credit where it's due. Bethesda, you did a great job of making it possible for a level 100/200 types to even be around with lower levels peeps. I commonly have level 20-30 people in my team and I never see it as an issue. This by itself is amazing and you have to respect that.
---
Do you have the plans?
---
Were you the person asking where the purveyor was located at?
---
Owch. Im trying to get him to have a hodge podge of gear with a touch of Rage game character
---
People who complain about the difficulty are either melee or don't want to spend more than a few bullets, that's all. Those alphas are nowhere nearly as tanky as the SBQ.
---
People underestimate 1* items. I used a 1* Bloody DCG for the longest time. Gets the same damage as a 3* and everything is 1 hit anyway. When the time came I couldn't get rid of it to anyone because it was a 1* (like gross, just a 1* lol) Now I have two 1*'s I can't get rid of. Oh well.
---
Regarding the enemy respawns when a new player arrives, I'd just like to say this is only bad within the context of an event, but normally in a place like the Burrows this is a good feature and shouldn't be removed completely.
---
Good for regular locations, not for events
---
&gt; If you can borrow me
---
You must be from Minnesota or Wisconsin.
---
Ditto.. up voted.
---
Thanks, Any idea what i should sell it for?
---
I have them for sale for free. I don’t think I’ve sold a single one.
---
Definitely BIV
---
Do you think its a better idea to get the mod before i sell it?
---
No idea. Never played on PlayStation. Only Xbox and PC versions.
---
that s actually a great idea ! i would love to see that in the game
---
Its fine when they go for you so you can lure them away, but has happened two times that the friendly attack the alpha and goes down in a punch
---
Were you alone? 
---
If I solo, the silo is usually snappy. If there is somebody else around, even for just entering and staying in the security booth, the server slows down considerably. I had to wait 15 minutes just to get the broken Mainframe Cores taken out of their socket yet the other guy just run around fine on my screen shooting the respawning robots. So it's not latency but server message priority I guess.
---
Yep. Best think I ever did was choose to buy build specific 1* weapons for 1-3k caps. I have used the same weapon for 90 levels.
---
One ambushed me by kiddie cabins. I didn't even kill him just got his health down. He disappeared and left behind an ash pile with a wing.
---
It's odd that you are not enjoying it. I have yet to fail an event and have had a great time doing so. No matter the update you people will complain about something.
---
It was me and my buddy. We waited for like ever before giving up.
---
I hope mine doesn’t come across as rude!
---
Thanks for that.👍🏻
---
Exactly what I thought when I opened the photo!
---
groves family cabin is the forest location..
---
I think everyone's problem is that Pew Pew was a gun, and a church pew was the only named religious furniture/item in the game except for the pastor's gear. So no one assumed it would be a bench and not a gun.
---
I usually love seeing people of all levels around the map doing their thing. It's just for events like this, that require a number of high level people, there needs to be some way for those people to congregate other than chance.
---
Doesn't Rose have her own station
---
No from a vendor @ Watoga or Grafton 👍🏻
---
You can also check the whitesprings sellers
---
That makes no sense to me. Once i have adrenaline rolling, my ~320 base damage Instigating Gatling gun (so only 45% armor penetration vs your 75%) starts onehitting supermutants. With 60% Adrenaline and instigating, i’m probably hitting ~1k damage, but you’ve got 30% more armor penetration.
---
Pc
---
Nyet, people being dicks because they can does not excuse them for being dicks. It takes a bad player AND bad design for this to be a problem.
---
I did end up getting a 3* gauntlet off a trade and to be honest it was not different. Same damage output but just a little faster but not like it needs to be faster when you one hit everything. 3* is definitely over rated.
---
Yeah, those are types of Casual Lining.
---
To find those, try Watoga Train Station or Whitespring Resort, that's where I found mine (up to treated).
---
I know shielded is bugged and unavailable, not sure about Protective, I'm still hunting that one
---
Is that real?
---
So you bought the mod then!?
---
Just made a post about my rank 3 mega sloth getting wrecked by the grafton monster. One hit kill.
---
I stopped using prime weapons a while back. I feel your pain. I hope you can find your 44 prime receiver! I feel as though I have a pile of prime 44 ammo sitting around somewhere that I'm Un attached to. If you're on Ps4 lmk. Cheers
---
Hey there is an idea. I'll give it a try. I don't think it will make difference but I do appreciate the suggestion. I didn't think of that.
---
Server hop the 2 sets in watoga, I got a full lvl 30 t51 set in about 10 hops.
---
I have 4 or 5 gauntlets ranging from 1-3 stars if you can't find anything by Sunday. I'm on Xbox.
---
The video or the youtube girl calling anyone with 10 bloodied weapons a cheat? Both are true.
---
Couldn't agree more. I have a Deathclaw Gauntlet that can one hit dam near anything (double damage if enemy is full health) and anytime I'm doing events like uranium fever, if a legendary pops up, I'll do the "come over here" emote and switch to a gun just to tag it, then let every one else kill it.
---
We were all at one point those low levels just hoping to hit a legendary so I try my best to make sure everyone tags it.
---
It clips through the black prospectors hat unfortunately, I thought the same thing.
---
The girl, idk who she is, I kinda wanna look her up so I can laugh. What's her channel?
---
Any versus legendary with 10% damage/25% fire rate and 90% weight reduction;
---
So much this, it's why I play bloodied, it makes the game playable for me.
---
This has not been my experience. Most shops I've seen have absurd prices for just about everything. I saw one guy selling screws for 20 caps a piece.
---
oh thank you!!!! I will check next time one flies off. I was up by Janet's soft serve last time and he flew off but I don't remember a pile. now I'll definitely look for one!
---
No not missing the point.   Most people PVP for cap farming.    If they see someone with a workshop, they will find the player that owns it to 1 shot that player and get caps. 
---
Realize that in Survival mode, you do not get as many caps anymore.
---
Would you want to farm caps from much tougher and skilled opponents  in survival mode or those PVE players who do not do much PVP in adventure mode?  Thus those guys have better chances.
---
The guy really did not care what type of workshop it was, he wanted caps.... Easiest way to do that is find a PVP workshop and kill the owner.  There you go.  Its still PVP regardless of how you look at it, the reasons behind the incident does not matter really.  
---
So if you take a PVP workshop, do not get upset when get killed.
---
Logging in now
---
It's hard to like something when you can't actually experience it because of the game crashing my friend.
---
7.62 * 39 is no where as strong as a 7.62*51 (308)
---
FFS I recently heard about a guy paying 18$ for a TSE Laser Rifle, weapon that I suppose was duplicated tens of thousands of times :D
---
InnovSurvivalist is her channel. She says if you got weapons or armor from reddit you payed to win. If you got bloodied weapons you are a duper because she has never gotten 1. And since she makes farming videos she would know lol. She said a level 3 character with a vendor is a duper and you should report anyone with low prices. Let Bethesda decide if you cheat or not. And in her comments she said if you didn't agree with her Video you are possible a scammer yourself. I was a sub until she made that video of pure witch hunt trash lol.
---
Try r/fo76guides :)
---
It is said it can spawn in one of the display cases in Harper's Ferry in the building that has a train car sticking out of it. I haven't seen the plans myself there yet though (PC):
---
Since there aren't any mods for it, it won't show up at the bench unless it's below 100% condition.
---
I just wish they would seperate the songs from the older games from the new ones. I am so goddamn sick of hearing songs that have been playing since fallout 3.
---
Yeah still dunno how to get it or use it tho
---
Weird.  I have done that almost daily for a while, never happens to me.  PC
---
...and who killed who. Who is wanted and reward information plus last location known.
---
I did yes I was looking for it.
---
I like the deathclaw gauntlet but did not find one yet.
---
So agree.. Just as every other version of Fallout mad it perfect clear.. You can head right out of the vault for the bottom of the map, but there were enough warnings that things are gonna get tough on the way there that if your crying.... Your an idiot!
---
Haven't tried it but someone mentioned put a small letter label on it, blueprint it, then store it.
---
Supposedly when you move, the blueprint remembers the inventory.
---
Again, I have NOT tried it (but will soon) just repeating what I saw in another post.
---
Unfortunately I'm PS4 😏
---
Indubitably.
---
But thanks for the offer it's much appreciated 👍🏻
---
Servers are working much slower now than some time ago. Bethesda probably bought cheaper cloud service to maximize income. It is really annoying that we need to wait now few min after every login before we can use stashes, vendors or see enemies.
---
They should just hire some musicians to cover some Appalachian folk music.  There has to be a ton of that in public domain.
---
They do and i make a good profit selling them for the cooking badge
---
Everytime i try to do this the other player just one shots them, so I end up just not caring and killing everything. It turns into "I have to one shot it before this person." Just vats it with a gun if you aren't a melee build, super easy.
---
That's not abuse as much as doing lots of work.
---
I like an idea like this, maybe not exact. Still would like to see some faction ties.
---
Yeah, I'll look that up. Iv had numerous bloodied stuff drop for me, not many good ones tho, and I don't usually farm legendaries.
---
Dude, it's part of the game that's pvp. Either stop btiching and moaning, or don't take workshops
---
I use the leather coat with it
---
So when you prime the Combat Rifle, it shoots ultracite .44?
---
I’ve been thinking about doing a survival play through but I hate survival score. Hoping they change it back to players killed really soon.
---
When i take a workshop like the power plant - i don't lock the fusion core machine - i find those passing through that need a fusion core just take one or two and move on.
---
I was desperate for one the other day as someone had just launched a nuke and i needed one for my power armor. I was near the power plant and it was claimed. Nobody was around and the machine was locked, so i took it. A level 80 showed up and attacked of course so i put him down, took the 2 fusion cores sitting in the machine, and headed off.
---
You may find that a dickish thing to do, but remember the workshops are for everyone's use, not just yours and its possible those showing up to take it from you also happen to want or need fusion cores.
---
Poseidon Power Plant is usually my preference as it basically holds itself. If someone happens to be passing and running low on cares and sees a machine running and powered, and locked, you can be sure they are going to take it from you.
---
After they leave, try taking it back - you would be surprised how many times other person won't come back to fight it out as they already have what they came for.
---
I also took it from 2 level 60+ the other day. I arrived on and i could see a fight had broken out (2 on 2) so i crouched and observed (invisible effect)  Turned out two level 10 - 12's had the plant and god bless them they had build so many generators to power the fusion core machine and were now being run out of it by these two 60+ who after taking it kept chasing them.
---
These guys kept coming back trying to claim back the hard work they had put into the place but it was just not happening so eventually they left. As soon as the 60+ players were in control i made my claim and spent the next 20 minutes earning a nice tidy sum of caps from their attempts to defend it from me.
---
Funny thing was i then got a message telling me what an asshole i was thinking i was all that because im 150+ taking on level 60's
---
Oh how that made me giggle. Doesn't matter what i do, when i claim a workshop for any reason i am somehow always the bad guy.
---
But back to my point - don't lock the extractors and you would be surprised how many people will not bother taking it off you as they only need the power core, not the entire workshop.
---
After the last patch?
---
Does someone need me to kick their ass?
---
In the theme of Fallout 3, Anything Goes?
---
Yep. Last night.
---
There's no way those events are 25%. I've done them over forty times, and I'm below 10%, which is okay, given how short the events are.
---
Yeah I noticed it’s hard to stay off the leaderboard with this system. You essentially always have to be hidden
---
I'd be happy knowing what the item was ...
---
You just unlocked "Hardened" (but for what weapon??????)
---
If you’re on Xbox, could I offer you 5k caps for the shotgun if it’s max level?
---
It's less unique than you'd think, and I'm also not saying this is the case for everyone - just making a suggestion *specifically for crashing* if you DO overclock and haven't tested your RAM.
---
I do have a bias towards starting with hardware and working up when troubleshooting, but it's never a bad thing to be confident that your foundation is good. If that's already been taken care of, great! Without that assurance it's difficult (logically) to be sure the problem really is with the software.
---
Let me add a Xbox One reason,  fps during big events drop to &lt; 10, maybe &lt; 5.
---
The combo literally nullifies explosives. They stack. You can still cripple yourself with your own explosives but you can stand on a mininuke and take no health damage. No idea how you take limb damage without taking health damage, but hey, it just works!
---
Only thing I build at workshops are two turrets(as enemy sponges while I'm reloading for Defend missions) a workbench to scrap loot, and a loot box.
---
Ok, I’ll be with you in about 5-10 mins
---
I was asked this in voice chat.. I was like.. wow.. someone was never dragged off to church with mom.....!
---
Can you still make these?  
---
I neeeeeeeeeed one!! lol
---
Two Shot was nerfed a while ago to be 1.2 or 1.25 shot, can't remember which.
---
This. I'll have 50 atoms for days, and then suddenly I have a couple hundred and don't even know what I did to get them!
---
Thanks for the reply, but it's currently at about 20%... :/
---
I'm going to try this, fed up with the mobs always attacking my work benches or generators first.
---
There’s a ton of easy-to-fix bugs like this, sadly. I wish they’d just throw a single developer at that list for one patch cycle. The patch notes could have like 200 bugfixes like that.
---
I purposely entered PvP with a guy in Whitesprings because he was hogging all the kills and XP at the front door.  I mean, I get it but at least make the effort to let others in on the action.
---
Yup... someone fuxked up the coding.
---
Weird ive repro this like 5 times already
---
I shoot any of the friendly npc's that approach me with the exception of the responder vendor bot.
---
Do you have Repair Kits? If not, I'm happy to give you an Improved one when I'm online (in about 12 hours)
---
Have you tried dropping it and picking it back up?
---
Putting it in your vending machine and taking it out?
---
&gt;experiencing invisible enemies, enemies in the floor, several minute load time of objects, sprites not rendering and coming in as red squares is proof enough.
---
I was responding specifically for troubleshooting crashes, which is something of an entirely different nature from in game glitches like these.
---
“Oh look! That vault dweller who likes to collect junk has taken over Gorge Junkyard. If you’re in need of some black titanium why not head on over and try asking politely?”
---
Are there patch notes on that?
---
The witch’s costume dress.
---
I was thinking about it and I see value in current leaderboards, but I also see how this value could be achieved elsewhere, hence I might decide to support this idea, still thinking.
---
The thing with being on leaderboards is that its great tool for summoning your opponents. But I think we could also drop a shop near our chosen arena, kill one of ours, make ourselves wanted and then summon the action by wanted status and lootbag icons.
---
Rose is okay but annoying and kinda broken.
---
That's exactly what many freeloaders do at SBQ and ISS events. Tagging and hiding then looting if someone spent a ton of ammo and killed the boss. If not, the taggers only lost five bullets, no biggie.
---
I don't understand how buying from a player vendors is different then buying from a reddit vendor? I also don't think she really knows what she is talking about. The comments had me laughing because it showed how totally clueless she is. Some of her subs said if you have 20 mutations for sale you are a cheater lol. My friend only makes serum and sells them. He spent hours farming and saving up. Now a clueless youtuber says people are cheats. 
---
I'm glad spider made this amazing guide and its getting shared. I think she should watch and learn from it. That 1 video lost all her credibility.
---
A good bet too is to build a few crops out in the open and one or two of the Defense wire and wood fences. or very close to the edge of the zone, enemies seem to love attacking crops and defense walls first. It gives the turrets and you a focused field of fire.
---
Juicehead and vinylicpumagaming flooded YouTube with terrible fo76 videos. Just about every other youtuber I've seen who does fo76 content actually cares about quality.
---
Blue screen sounds like your computer... I’ve never had bluescreens. I’ve had plenty of crashes, but if get them regularly it means I need to reboot.
---
Two shot only increases damage by 25% and is already factored in to the damage number you're seeing. As for the lever action, it might be a question of resistance type, distance, or any number of things. However, objectively, the gauss should do more.
---
I would leave it as it is currently but I’ll admit I hate being tagged on the map if you are top 3.  Keep the leaderboard as it is but remove the player ID if you make the top 3.
---
This has been one of the most-requested features since BETA.  Probably in the top three.  There have been a shitload of threads on it.  ("Deck" or "Loadout" would be your search terms.)
---
It's been requested so many times that someone made a mod to do this on PC.  The rest of us are SOL so far.
---
Get a few ranks of fireproof. You'll take more damage from the swarms of scorched than the beast itself.
---
Could always change it to a system that indicates where someone was killed.
---
For example, in survival you get a message saying 'john killed bob' or something right? What if that was amended to 'John killed Bob near Grafton' and an area (of whatever search area size...not too big but not small enough that you could pinpoint the spot) was indicated. This would give you an idea of where players are on the map without highlighting them. This would let players both avoid confrontations if they wanted, or give them an indication of where to start if they wanted to hunt another player...think of it like tracking down the sound of gunshots in the distance.
---
This could either be for all kills or just kills from the leaderboard even.
---
I don't play survival myself but just thought I'd toss in an idea.
---
I have an extensive inventory with like few dozens explosive weapons, yet somehow I mostly use a 2* bloodied vatscritDMG combat rifle, and I rock in PvP, very few guys can take me down without number advantage. I also have zero assassin/sentinel pieces on my main PvP toon.
---
I run a solo rifle build and my best gun is an AA handmade so far. Been on and off with how much I play but mostly casual.  With chems and all combat perks equipped I can one shot mutants from stealth and still mow them down in a second with a few quick headshots from not stealthed. Honestly tho, super mutants are def not really the toughest enemies at all so they probably aren't the best for a baseline here.
---
Quit whatever you are doing and join Bethesda
---
There are already token events in the game outside of the badges, i can only currently think of Halloween candy trade -Monster Mash-, the Miner scrip currency: NOT LEGENDARY SCRIP: -I wanna say lucky hole mine event?
---
I'm on PlayStation, we calm it bluescreen because when the game crashes it gives us the blue screen saying the game crashed
---
You realize you are going off of just your own experience, right?
---
You realize how stupid that sounds?
---
Yep, right [here!](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2J2ong0O2B6GAI1AeIdGcp/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-29-2019)
---
For people like you, i run around and turn off all the lights before i shut the doors. You don't want to be wasting electricity now.
---
This.  I like the leaderboard stats and features but hate being tagged in the top 3.  
---
Off topic, anyone dealing with stealth issues lately?   I swear it’s intermittent and not sure if glitched or not.
---
So you got a Two Shot Explosive Explosive Handmade?   Sounds like you snagged a duped weapon, grats!
---
Anyway, If you are going for Stealth sniper build, then
---
* 1 rank of each Rifleman
---
* Tank Killer
---
* Gun Fu rank 1/Grim Reaper
---
* Mods on the gun that give +Sighted Accuracy / + Penetration / + dmg
---
* \+ crit chance/+ crit dmg perks
---
* \+ stealth perks including the nighttime ones
---
If doing Auto
---
* Gun Fu rank 3/Grim Reaper
---
* 1 Rank of each Commando
---
* Mods that give + AP/+Hip Fire/+Penetration / + ammo capacity
---
* \+crit chance/+crit damage perks
---
* \+ stealth perks
---
Don't try to leach from an event I've spent the last my time, and resources to complete successfully. 
---
That makes **you** the scumbag, thinking you can fast travel in at the last minute, and benefit from the rewards I've earned.
---
I agree.. your search was not thorough...
---
Yes I know, but if all you have to do is hide within the event zone then many more would do this I think. It’s a problem sometimes now, even worse if they changed it
---
I have 100gb internet in a wealthy area. I constantly test it. It doesn't knock out with anyone else.
---
No, it's not the internet. Yes, it happens with every friend I play with.
---
Yes, the server stability is dog shit.
---
You are a true Vault dweller.
---
That wouldn't be possible. as an AI engineer it's extremely difficult to have that sort of scanning and also be even more expensive to record all of those voice lines.
---
Locked down camps make me want to get inside. I will find a way inside even if I have to drag a scorchbeast to destroy a wall
---
Im usually pretty angry at the cards by that point and dont really appreciate them much at all.. lol
---
All these things are only happening in Arktos new area so I don't see how they are unrelated
---
It’s not as much of a problem if there are 12 people playing.  The part that sucks is joining the server and you automatically make the top 3 by default.
---
At least you can play. My game crashes every time I enter. Really disappointing.
---
It looks great with an ushanka hat.
---
Wait til you get some legendaries, they will die in a few hits.
---
I think someone has already bought it. I don’t suppose you have another plan on you?
---
Yesss the lead drought is real. I’ve probably gone through 1500 steel as well
---
I'm pretty sure that's *exactly* what has happened, and I also agree with others that there are hidden mods - which probably started life as little hacks to accomplish things within Bethesda's system -  that counter-intuitively give weight that you cannot control.  All of this would be easily solved by doing what any sane person would believe the 90% WR meant - simply compute 90% off the *total weight*, not some unknown starting value.  I don't know what's so difficult about that, but there's ample evidence that the right hand often doesn't know what the left hand is doing at Austin.
---
Even better, a Sentrybot host for the classical station.
---
Especially since I have no friends to play and communicate with and I'm too scared to talk to strangers :(
---
I've heard that this is a visual bug with the pip boy and it actually is applying your RR but don't quote me on that.
---
Nah we all make errors, I knew what you meant
---
I really doubt if it can be high on their priority list ;)
---
I haven't found one that I liked. Thought they were cool at first but then quickly became "meh".
---
Saw someone in an event using formula q. It gives a notice on screen saying formula q has restored the animals and heals them up.
---
A gauss at lvl 35 is weak at lvl 50, try to go to a lvl 50 weapon, your lever does more damage cause its higher level
---
Solution is easy, count all HP not just the boss in an event, if someone chip away more than 10 percent he gets loot, otherwise a spoiled fruit. That will encourage good teamwork and keep freeloaders from coming. They won't show up if they have to spend more than a few bullets.
---
On Fo76 now, are you on ps4 possibly ? So i can send you screenshots ? (Tried to start chat but it says 'something gone wrong and the conversation couldn't be started'
---
Also it's not listed but two shot weapons completely fuck your accuracy and recoil. For a sniper type weapon it's not very good.
---
She's right though. Report and let Bethesda sort it out. If you're not a cheater, you got nothing to fear lol.
---
Yea at first I thought this would be some hateful post but it makes sense, I havent gotten anything good from the event because everyone forgets the animals and comes in just to get a legendary, that most likely wont even be 3*
---
You an IT guy?
---
Losing 2x your lvl in caps was excessive.  But they went too far the other way and there’s really no cap incentive to make kills.
---
If that wasn't you at my machine, someone beat you to them
---
Ahhh, gotcha.
---
oof it would be so cool to have a two shot flare gun
---
Do we get our own uniforms?! I’m in.
---
Maths?
---
They do AOE damage too. With the explosive perks they do a noticeable amount more damage.
---
I agree but posting this doesn’t help much because everyone here knows about this. If they’ve been doing it in spite of other people posting they’re not going to stop because of you. I suspect most that do it aren’t checking the subreddit in the first place.
---
Bethesda doesn't care.
---
Fair enough. Thank you
---
Lol I found the one guy on the internet that understands typos!
---
They aren't that uncommon, since a lot of players oogle over the mass-duped Bloodied Explosive anything.  But the Bloodied one alone is a nice weapon because it does 450 damage every second (more or less) and can go for 500 rounds before reloading.  Before then, I had an explosive Suppressor's Lever Action Rifle which hit for maybe 250-300, but only held 6 shots, so you waste a lot of time reloading the darn thing.
---
Exactly. I’ve always hated token systems in RPGs/MMOs.
---
Instead of being pinpointed in a specific location perhaps they could modify it by area or region instead.  Make it a notification.  So and so player is in Watoga region like they do with kills.
---
going to check my plan character to see if I have more copies
---
Honestly so many of them are gun related that I just stopped going through them once I maxed out on health and melee related perks. I know I’m missing out. I need to spend some time going through all of them. Have any suggestions?
---
...Ooooooh. Thanks! I'll have to make a list of places I gotta visit now and hit them up.
---
 I don't think this event should be or really is "Solo-able". The real objective, for maximum loot is to summon three, level three friendlies. Keep them all alive through the entire event, that's a "perfect" completion with the maximum rewards. This is and should be impossible for one person to complete alone.
---
Your point about a server notice is totally valid, I feel the idea that a player might have too many notices could be easily addressed by having the player select the events they want notices for in a Pip-Boy menu.
---
Once the Alpha (or Alphas) appear the participating members in the event need to high-tail-it towards those baddies to get hits in. Making it so anyone in the event area could loot all the kills or at least the Alphas may help there. In truth though an event like this needs multiple objective areas to force cooperation, that seems like the whole point. 
---
 I like your idea about a defined loot pool as special rewards for these kind of events, similar to the Pioneer scout reward pool. Maybe something with a changing pool of 3 star legendaries that players can choose between for multiple completions or a 100% completion in one go. Like a similar token system.
---
 As a side note, I think the bullet sponge thing is (so far) the only thing they have come up with to prevent some player from one shot killing the Alpha and preventing players from getting hits in.
---
Err I dunno they were just available on the side deal
---
Thanks alot buddy!
---
Which perks would you suggest for it?
---
Personally I'm always happy to buy something called a *"bladed"*, because that gives me all the information I need.
---
Well I'm out of ideas then, sorry :(
---
*supportive high five*
---
I don't think the idea is pointless, I've participated in other threads where ideas like a T.E.N.T. were thrown around - basically similar concept - small more mobile C.A.M.P. just for scrapping and storing. I think giving us the ability to repair is a bit much - as long as we can get under encumbered again that should be enough. 
---
Sucks when you have a lot of sweet junk and weapons on hand, but you can't fast travel - then you have to slowly walk to the nearest train station.
---
Usually if i see low lvl players i give them food, water And rad x.
---
Based on the changes that have been made over the past couple months, new content, bug fixes, etc, I think they do. Maybe this issue just hasn't had enough visibility.
---
These are great points!  I haven't attempted this event yet.   My team mate wasn't able to join me Tuesday.  Wednesday we weren't on long enough to do anything other than expend the vendors' caps and scrap legendaries.  By Thursday there was no one around Arktos Pharma.  A few times I saw the event and only 1 person was doing it.  It's really sad that 2 days after launch the event is falling off in popularity.
---
Honestly I only want that Stimpak Diffuser plan so I can complete the Medic badge.  From what I hear you have to protect all 3 friendly creatures and that just isn't going to happen with a bunch of randoms and the way the event is setup.  Maybe I'll get lucky.
---
Two-Shot was nerfed to only deal 25% damage, while still providing a poor accuracy problem.
---
It was done to address the problem of the Two-Shot Explosive combination, which was allowing weapons to more than double their damage output consistently.  Unfortunately, in the process, Bethesda nerfed the individual effects into oblivion rather than the combined effect.  Two-Shot, in particular, now doesn't work in the way anyone would intuitively believe it would.
---
Nevertheless, what you have is an inaccurate sniper rifle that does 25% more damage than normal.  You might want to look into an Instigating, which would deal double-damage on the first shot.
---
This is REALLY helpful! Thank you!
---
It’s almost like Bethesda doesn’t want to acknowledge New Vegas even exists. So many good things that could be used from that game. They should just port over the ammo crafting and break down mechanics into 76.
---
Glow sights is pretty easy to figure out. Fighting glowing enemies? Use it. Nothing else in the game gives you 60% more damage for 3 points. 
---
Not fighting glowing enemies? Don’t use it, it’s pure waste. 
---
Glowing enemies have to have “glowing” in their name IIRC.
---
Of course, if you are already 1-hitting things,  there is no point in increasing damage further. So if glowing ones are 1HK, glow sights is a waste.
---
I may have to start playing again thanks.
---
That's what I'm saying.
---
To kill things.
---
Unless you make ammo. People got banned for that. If you are innocent is one thing. But to make a video and say a lv 3 with gear is a bot or cheater is wrong. In her comments she said she reports a lot of people who have things she don't. Imaging the poor player with the mule in game. She put his info out in public and when they asked her to stop in the comments. She said, stop spamming her comments to the poor player.
---
And let the mutants pay for it?
---
That sucks, and shouldn't happen. I had a melee guy in PA do the same thing, and the only way I got a tag in was by blasting his faceplate with my explosive handmade.
---
250 caps
---
Any energy weapon with explosive perks is considered a legendary because they don't drop anymore. The only reason there's so many on the market is because of the duping exploits, a tse gauss rifle sells for anywhere from 10k-18k maybe more if you have a serious collector.
---
In what way is it “under heavy weapons”?
---
Please use the search function and take a look at one of the few hundred threads that asked the same question.
---
Indeed.  There's a lag between the items showing up and the ability for them to count toward the objective.  If you fall into that window in between, it won't count and you'll have the quest marker stuck on your head.  The quest will become impossible to complete.  I've screwed it up before - felt pretty bad about it.
---
This same type of thing also happened to me during one of Abbie's quests months ago, where I had to quit and re-log to proceed.  It's pretty bad that it still exists in new quests.
---
I like most of these suggestions but the easiest improvement is just remove the top 3 player identification on the map.  It serves no real purpose other than put a target on your back and reduce the time you spend in survival mode.  I enjoy the hunting of other players, but it’s tough to do when you are automatically highlighted on the map.
---
The scorchbeasts do remind me of the dragon encounters in Skyrim. Maybe that’s what the person was getting at?
---
I've received an answer, I'll delete this post
---
Or just guide folks. I was very confused my first time in, not having seen any walk through videos or anything. With the mayhem of robots and friendly creatures and hostile creatures and turrets and everything, it can be hard to follow exactly what the quest is telling you to do. Folks are more likely to be ignorant than malicious.
---
I love the leaderboard and the fact that it’s survival score not just kills. But I agree that the pinpointing the too 3 sucks. My username starts with an A so I often get pinpointed as soon as I enter a server without a lot of people.
---
You get event rewards just for being in the event area already.
---
Worst part is i was so close to getting another legendary deal from the purveyor, as i had around 96 scrip i believe? so that only mildly stung a little...
---
We all admire your determination though, when you decide to take a seat, NOTHING is going to interrupt you.
---
They changed it up where the losses aren’t as significant.  Regardless, you can plan ahead and not carry so much crap.
---
I would say only report on reddit to either A. Find out if it is a bug or something your doing wrong or B. If you never hear anything back after reporting it to bethesda and its game breaking or effecting you very badly
---
The mothman was actually just under a tree, no weather around.
---
A suggestion: don't buy it.  It's underarmor, but it clips though pretty much every set of armor I've ever tried with it.  It's clearly broken.
---
If my bitching and moaning bothered you, you can just keep on scrolling past. No need for a comment.
---
That’s awesome. The players are what matter in a game like this. Thanks for being an awesome part of the community!
---
Server hopped til the lighthouse quest was there tbh. It was a pain in the ass.
---
Of course I can. It's unlocked for me. Psn unikron08 I'll be online in abt an hour
---
Do you need to buy tickets to avoid the crowd?
---
How wrong you are!
---
Besides, the objective in Mario is clear and always the same. Dumb comparison.
---
There is no lots of it. But you can find some in military bases and BoS outposts around the fissures.
---
Not much (like 1-3 bags / location if you are lucky) and they are farmed aswell.
---
Sheepsquatch hide also gives you a single fiber.
---
I think some people still dont under stand that when you set the price it is per unit not per quantity of product you want to sell.
---
I hope you do! See you in the wasteland!
---
The easiest free range is the forest one, because all the adds are level 1-9 (i think you can get a level 16 yaoi guai). The sheepsquatch is still a beast, at least level 50, potentially higher. The savage divide and mire ones are pretty equivalent, they both can have max level enemies.
---
Any military base, ie camp McClintock.
---
i wish they would‘ve just switched. i had another empty chassis in my stashe, they were both empty. :/
---
oh well. maybe the pieces will be back when i log back in today, but i don‘t have much hope. 
---
bye lvl 35 excavator PA, aka 3638393 screws + 364839 black titanium
---
My comment was meant as a general "you", not at you specifically, OP. I could have made that more clear in my post.
---
Not yet! They are probably hoping weve forgotten about it...
---
Yes, even just being able to scrap would be enough. There are parts of the map with no train stations or Red Rockets.
---
Am I the only one who literally hates Biv lmao? I force myself to do the daily so one day I can get the keg but I mute my tv for his dialogue lol
---
Bethesda will fix it soon. This fix could be the next big reveal in the E3! They are hard at working!
---
Neat idea. But I think it could use rifle perks (if it isn't already like that, I have no idea) instead of new damage perks.
---
Your mods are cool af tho. An automatic crossbow... Yeah, looks fun !
---
The cliffside above Whitesprings is handy and cheap travel to most of the map, but I miss the eyrie on top of the Seneca rocks. Great view but lonely.
---
It *did*. I’m fairly certain the last patch fixed that. Check the patch notes; I don’t run shotguns so I kind of skimmed over that.
---
You can get banned for swearing??
---
Well it was only two star so not like I got a full powered one lol
---
Alright, looks like I have some base hopping to do, thanks
---
recently I have been picking up and cooking all the glowing meat I can find. With super duper I can easily get 20-30 glowing steaks these sell for a nice ammount at vendors and all this can be done while farming for other things.
---
Some of those ghouls also don't regenerate health while they drop legendary items.
---
Kill everything, especially supermutants you get decent xp and more often than not they drop caps
---
NO THEY AREN’T, JUST ANNOYING
---
"Flare gun"?.... wonder what it does... oh, shoots flare.... Look a flare..
---
ok..  scrap..
---
tee hee..
---
That guy is ripping you off. Dont sell for less than 5k
---
Very early on you can just hunt super mutants in Summerville. This will get you levels and steel to sell (bend to people at 1~2 caps peer scrap) as well as ammo.
---
Absolutely serious. PS4. Small sample size, but still, I'm amazed. And have no idea how everyone else is doing it. Even when people actually hold the pylons, it's such a bullet sponge and the time limit is worse than the SBQ fight, which fails more often than not in my experience.
---
Better idea: You can farm and sell up to 1400 caps a day and if you buy ballistic fiber with 3* hard bargain and grape mentats, you can get a really good deal but also sell more since what you buy offsets what you sell to allow you to sell more. 
---
Make sure you sell first before buying!!!
---
I’ve seen it available quite a bit at player vendors as well. (Perks and meds won’t help but usually lower price anyways.)
---
So sell what you don’t need or that you can farm easily and just buy it.
---
Still want one?
---
I've yet to find a place where it's reasonable to farm any mobs. I'm probably comparing this game to eso too much but that was like the only way to level up.
---
I submitted my proof of purchase the first week they were accepting them. Its 4+ months for me also with no response. After submitting my proof of purchase, they said it would be 4-6 months to make and deliver. I have sent 9 follow up replies to my open ticket to Bethesda. I have not recieved a single reply. 
---
All i can say is, it better be one hell of a canvas bag we are waiting on. The reviewers got a badass canvas backpack. We not nylon due to a unforeseen canvas shortage🤔😒😕
---
Max damage quickly turns into wasted overkill on 2h melee weapons aside from very specific enemies you don’t fight often. That’s why people want swing speed.
---
Also 40% swing speed equates to more DPS than 40% more power attack damage- you can swing endlessly, you can’t power attack endlessly. Combine that with less wasted overkill damage with Swingspeed, and/or faster followup attacks if for some reason your first swing didn’t connect (dodged, server lag, enemy blocked...) and it’s pretty clear why swingspeed is so desired.
---
Yes. This. I just picked it back up... sort of. I jump into activities and I can see these high level players just annoyed with me. SORRY. I’m just trying to figure stuff out. Not the players’ fault but a new/returning player feels a little uninvited. Which is ironic in a funny way.
---
Still looking for one?
---
Summerville? Where is that?
---
That’s a really good idea, thanks!
---
Im actually selling my Two-Shot Gauss as ive found it to be very inaccurate, just felt like both shots were never connecting properly.
---
Picked up a Mutants Guass for a few hundred caps, so I'm switching to that
---
Sometimes I one shot certain legendaries like feral should or something weak, but I use a TSE gatling gun so I generally try to finish it instead.
---
Great photo!
---
You guys should stop using terms like failure if you're not actively offering BGS anything more than a concept. The majority of the posts here are cute when talking about infrastructure but you guys come off as ignorant. Instead of creating a post that comes off as a solution create an actual solution because you're just complaining. Which is fine, I complain to people I know IRL but I wouldn't think to make a public post saying "Your hard work was a failure" unless I knew how to realistically implement the changes I'm suggesting.
---
I'd imagine you can make it look good with a little creativity.  Drifter's Outfit would be a good start.  Science Scribe outfit, maybe.
---
Or we could get synths, they could our your appearance and appear in our camps, on roads, at events and specifically target whoever they look like, to replace them lol they could even shiw up and try and steal our loot.
---
I've yet to come across a Greenskin I couldn't melt with a decent shotgun or energy rifle. What approach do normally take that makes them seem 'bullet spongey' to you?
---
Now that they actually land and stay on the ground longer it’s literally easier... before, many times they wouldn’t land at all as well as the SBQ... that was hell...lol
---
What system are you on?
---
You can only get Gauss rifles as either level 35 or level 45 unfortunatly.
---
Truth be told, the canvas backpacks are pretty slick.  
---
I did the same thing only I've held after they told us "4 to 6months", because I figured "Well they have to do this to avoid getting sued so they'll make good on it".
---
PvP is basically a thing of the past, so a lot of the "raiders" left, and after the ban waves hitting dupers settled, we were left with a lot less toxicity. Now it's just mostly Fallout fans, playing a Fallout game together, like it should have been from the start.
---
I know, just all in all try to go for lvl 50 weapons
---
&gt; Once i have adrenaline rolling, 
---
*Puts on plumber hat.*
---
There's your problem right there.
---
*Takes off plumber hat.*
---
You are assuming optimum conditions whereas I'm assuming that the character just got placed, i.e. no buffs outside equipment or static perks.
---
Go play with:  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) 
---
Again, does my Bloodied melee build main character have any problem with bullet sponges? No, but then again he's level 211. But my alt rifle character? Yeah she's not even level 100 and doesn't have anywhere near the gear my main does. And yes, it does kinda hurt to put multiple magazines into a level 62 Charred Ghoul.
---
As others have said, “Diseased” prefix can override “legendary” prefix. It’s just the label, like the Legendary effect overriding the Light/Sturdy/Heavy label on armor pieces. It’s still heavy armor, they’re just trying to keep names from getting too long. 
---
You can also get Legendary enemies that say Legendary but don’t have stars after their name.
---
Is your name The Ginger?  Folks will say that it takes two people to fuck a ~~ostrich~~ radstag.
---
If you're on PS4 I'm thegunguyinc if you ever need a hand with a quest.
---
Trying to do the weekly survival events. Sees number  my name and 2 on leaderboard. Nope I like having an intact camp and a chance to fight back. Stupid idea might as well be shining a giant Bat signal into the sky over my position
---
From everything I've read the problem is fast traveling directly to the event or directly to arktos pharma, the trick is to fast travel to somewhere close and walk in on foot. Tried this yesterday and game didn't crash, also worked for my wife.
---
Step 1) Buy all 19 serum recipes from the enclave for 18000 caps each, 
---
Step 2) launch lots of nukes and farm/craft lots of stable flux
---
Step 3) craft lots of serums and put them in your vending machines
---
Step 4) Profitt!!!!
---
(The xp you'll get from all the farming is a bonus!)
---
About 3-4 weeks ago I received an email from them to confirm my shipping address because they had not correctly registered it, this should mean its in the final stages to ship
---
During double XP weekend this happened to me everytime I logged on and I hadn't even taken a shot at another player once. It is just a bad joke to me.
---
You would love dadjokes sub then.
---
FANTASTIC JOB!!! I love this concept but have had such a miserable fucking time trying to do similar bunker builds that I've given up trying.
---
How many rounds does it take to break?  
---
Do you run gunsmith perk to slow the break rate?
---
If it weren't for the fact that I really like where I've been for the last several months, I'd love to do a diner CAMP someday.
---
In Portland, we have a number of high-roofed A-frame buildings which were Tastee-Freez at one point.  But that look really stood out to me as something that would be a neat design for a CAMP.
---
Willing to part with one?
---
Like putting the syringer in the drill
---
L e v e l 1 0
---
Only the ones you find naturally in the world are instanced.
---
Itll be cool when we get them! I think the cavas bag will be pretry slick as well. They part that makes me mad is that they are completely quiet about the whole thing. They have not said one word publicly about it since they said they were going to replaced the nylon ones. Be nice if they would give a status
---
Same here tho
---
Todd Howard has personally praised New Vegas. There are multiple references to New Vegas in Fallout 4. Fallout 4 and 76 have a vastly improved crafting mechanic and completely different design philosophies.
---
This narrative of Bethesda 'hating' New Vegas is so fucking annoying
---
"freeloaders"
---
How dare other people get pretend stuff, even though I don't miss out on any of that pretend stuff when they do."
---
Look, if they were *taking* drops from you? Sure. But seeing as how everyone gets a drop... I fail to see how that is somehow *worse* than one D-bag ensuring nobody else gets a drop.
---
But hey, what's more 'Murcan than that, I guess?
---
I only have four points in it.  That maxes out Lone Wanderer.
---
It's kind of a pain to swap it out for Hard Bargain or Happy Camper or Travel Agent, but whatever.
---
I currently just have 2 which are in hard bargain
---
Couldn't agree more with this, being a frequent of the market subs and a couple Facebook selling hubs i have an idea of what prices usually are, unfortunately most of the community doesn't frequent those markets so it comes down to how bad do i want whatever they are selling.
---
When did you submit your proof of purchase?
---
It Wouldn't Work Because A Good Radio Dj Has A Personality. Thats Why We Help Travis In Fallout 4 To Refresh His And People Comment On How It's Better Than It Used To Be. How Could A Robot Have A Personality When They Are Not Programmed To Have One. General Atomics Didn't Make Personalities They Just Made Different Voice Boxes.
---
Like the week they were asking for it, so late november I think it was if not early december
---
I know! By the time you earn the 342,000 caps to buy all of the serum recipes, you'll be well over 100+ lvl already.
---
It's a win, win, win, win scenario!
---
No thanks. I know it worth more then that.
---
They all take different amounts to break. Flamer and grenade launcher take about four reloads from 200% durability to break. It will take about 8 mini nukes for a Fatman to break from 200%.
---
Huh, i might have been a bit confusing in my wording there, i mean grind to see if we could still get explosive gauss. Tesla explosive is definitely legacy. 
---
Though yeah, i'm not sure why they didn't add them into the notes either.
---
Right there with you hahahahaha
---
I think you are right.
---
Whitespring is one of the best areas to farm.
---
I haven't, but I will next sesh.  thx
---
Someone always goes for the sheep lol
---
"Speeding is not a driver problem, it's a manufacturer problem... automobiles shouldn't be able to go faster than speed limits"
---
See how ridiculous that sounds?
---
I completely agree.   
---
To be completely honest this has severely affected my view of Bethesda as a whole, I know that seems dramatic and I'm fully aware that they don't care and it seems stupid "It's just a bag".  
---
... It's kinda like when you meet your hero and they turn out to be just a massive asshole.
---
Ok just wondering. Trying to gauge some kind of a time window. I havent received that email yet and i submitted around the same time.
---
Could be that your shipping address was entered in perfectly, I wrote mine in so maybe they didnt understand my handwriting
---
Same same...
---
Agreed.
---
Camp McClintock, Fort Defiance. Ammo bags area regularly found in both locations.
---
6 - 4 for lone wandered, 1 for travel agent and 1 for tenderiser
---
With unyielding I can share three perks worth even with only 3 points of charisma. Recently I freed up a point and may put an extra pt there so I can max out lone wanderer.
---
MAN do I need perk presets though. So annoying to constantly be flipping perks in and out.
---
Dude, you forgot to add the two shot. You will loose in battle to the TSE Drill
---
They look like PJ’s that the sons of anarchy would wear, don’t get too excited.
---
Good point. I never considered that actually
---
Damn, you saw right through me.
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_   
---
Any chance for an update?
---
3 enough for maxed hard bargain. And I run lone wanderer 2 when not using that
---
Objectively false, not everyone wants this.
---
You have zero idea what any of the rest of us are doing. 
---
And this isn't all about me, this is about how YOU want the rest of us to have to listen to a call for help you get loot because you are not organized enough or social enough to get a group to go in before hand.
---
That event happens every thirty minutes. People already complain about how fast food and water needs pop up and that happens every 50 minutes. I get that you want this feature but it is seriously going to be a nag for other people.
---
A toggle is absolutely necessary so those of us who don't care that you want loot when you want it can opt out and don't have to see it flash on our screen twice an hour.
---
Thank you! I’m on XB1. Apparently all the co-op players are on PS4!
---
Ah, I see that now.  Thx :)
---
Sentinel or Cavalier is one aspect of Bloodied, but the real workhorse is the Serendipity perk in Luck that prevents you a chance to avoid taking any damage at all at low health.  It's commonly coupled with Dodgy (% damage reduction at cost of AP), Lone Wanderer (blank 30% damage reduction and AP boost), Blocker (blanket 45% damage reduction from melee attacks), and Suppressor (reduce target's damage output for 2 seconds after hitting it).
---
Also, as others noted, Sent/Cav has a chance to reduce damage by 15%.  It doesn't nullify any damage, and it scales in reduced increments with additional pieces.
---
If you don't want that fe lever message me and we can talk prices
---
For the love of everything fix the Gatling Plasma issues
---
I’m still in if they come with a free Jax Teller.
---
I watched a video afterwards and confirmed I'd pretty much figured it out by the end, it's simple but far from easy. Basically first you collect food and put it in the hoppers; the more you get in the hoppers the stronger the animal you're protecting will be. Then you defend the animal. If you're alone or just with another low-level person, you've got basically no hope of completing successfully. I feel most sorry for the guy I was with because he was level 57 and I'm in the 190s so there were legendary Gutsys and Assaultrons spawning in addition to all the other crazy stuff - likely my fault for being present.
---
A server-wide notification would be great, or at least get on a decent-sized team and send your lowest-level player in first to initialize it in the hope that most of the beasties and robots will be as low a level as possible.
---
Genius idea.
---
   “What am I missing here?”
---
It sounds like you’re missing your targets.
---
I think I can if your criticism makes no sense. Workshops are supposed to be a risk not you just take it and have it it's supposed to pvp. You're not a high level and you're complaining about getting destroyed by someone higher level they've spent more time on the game and should be able to kill you. And workshops are a risk so you shouldn't be all angry. You offer no real criticism. Just I got killed WAAAA
---
There are traffic rules you need to follow. I haven't seen any playing rules in FO76. Your example fails in every level.
---
Sorry.  i am am PSN and cannot help.
---
Yes and I like those! I do the mining one whenever it procs. Sadly monstermash rewards are syb-par at best as I got the highend reward and it was disheartening.
---
They do, but you have to be his pocket healer :(.
---
Thanks mate! Much appreciated! And great initiative on this post as well. 
---
And I feel you
---
For me it absolutely is why. Why would people show up on the map? It doesn't make sense from an in game perspective. Even wanted people showing up is a stretch but I can at least explain that one away by having the pipboy report it to other vault dwellers.
---
&gt; Edit: BIV would be the best.
---
They could have a call-in section and BIV could call in and ramble on drunkenly while the robo-host tried to keep them on topic.
---
Hang out around Flatwoods. Kill ghouls and do Fertile Soil if it's active. Scrap everything and cook everything. Scrap weapons and armor and then see if you can mod your existing kit. 
---
Take the path up the mountain to the east up to cabins by the bridge. Kill all the mobs, loot all the stuff. 
---
Take the highway north to Sutton. Stop at the Sutton train station to scrap and stash your junk. Take the tracks down into Sutton and clear out the old raider base. There's also sometimes a mole rat event. Loot everything and go back to the station to scrap and stash. 
---
Follow the tracks north through Sutton, and then there's a highway going east over the hill to Helvetia. Clear out Helvetia and loot it. From Helvetia you can go east to Horizon's edge, North to Greg's Mining Supply, or south to the water treatment plant. 
---
Cook everything. Craft lots of stuff. Mod stuff.
---
yup..
---
4 four the lone wanderer.. I swap in stuff as needed...
---
Read through this thread (Yes, I can't believe I actually did!) and OMG, really.. first it went through the funny part and then... then.. It got really serious.. I was.. wait..wait. somebody is actually saying they might want this Legendary drill??? really.. 
---
(next thread)
---
In my very unscientific test of standing in water with it on and off it doesn't seem to be just visual.
---
No, i was asking where the barbecue place was.
---
I find the flamer one odd because I found a legendary  executing on  and used it for the Scout challenge and went though at least 2.5 full reloads and it still had a lot of durability left in it.
---
i can confirm. Creatures are attacking instead of running away
---
I have 3 points, that allows me to switch between hard bargain 3 and lone wander 2 plus travel agent if I’m short on caps or tenderiser 1 if I’m not trying to save on caps
---
Travis might as well be a robot, he repeats himself so often.
---
Mr. New Vegas essentially is, so he gets a pass.
---
You can organize with others, you just have to do it outside of the game itself, which does suck but there are entire groups that do this everyday.
---
The ankward moment when you realize there is no content in the game and people are trying their best to create own content.
---
Definitely saving this post for future use. But now I'm afraid to even start rebuilding my camps :D I've seen lots of stupid bugs in this building system since beta but I never encountered many of the bugs you described in your post yet. Guess some of them came with the latest patches... I hope cms will see this post to pass it along to the dev-team.
---
Would we *all*, though? Do we *all* love Biv?
---
Mods affect durability and magazine size. It depends I suppose.
---
6 but only due to me playing in groups so I can share cards. If you’re not planning on groups I’d say 4 for maxed lone wanderer and travel perk card. 
---
Group play- as long as you have a 1* card you can share with others you should be good.
---
I max out the lone wanderer perk, I also get the one perk where fast traveling costs less, and I get the one that gives vendors better prices
---
MODUS for nukes.
---
Um. Sorry, but your phrasing of “i can regularly get up to over...” sure sounds like you are *reaching* it, not that it is your starting point. Reaching it sure sounds like stacking buffs. IE Adrenaline. 
---
Literally the only equipment that increases damage for a ranged player is their weapon, so armor in relation to damage is mostly meaningless (at best you can talk about Perception boosts to VATS accuracy, or Luck boosts to VATS crit gain, but those aren’t direct damage and also only matter in VATS). My bloodied stealth VATS rifleman was oneshotting (stealth headshots) supermutants by her 40’s, I found a L35 2shot VATS accuracy LA rifle. Yes, thats a bloodied stealth VATS build, but anyone and everyone can just build that way, the only “special” thing I had was the rifle, and I found it.
---
I usually lock my private area, because I don't need more toilet paper bags to my bed.
---
Ok no prob. I'm grabbing coffee then I'll sign on. What's your IGN
---
Because in the game just as in life you need to do something to be rewarded. Maybe if you’re still a kid you don’t understand because mommy and daddy do everything for you. But in life and in games.. you want something you work for it and contribute
---
And yet... people still speed. 
---
The point, which you well know... is that the ability to do a thing, doesn't make it justified.
---
I get it, you like to exploit shit in game. Just say that.
---
I’ll try this thanks
---
I agree with almost everything that you said. I don't agree, however, with the idea that the DLC/add on is a failure. It brought folks in and brought them together to fight their way through a ~~hard as fuck~~ dungeon. IMO, that's the point of the entire game.
---
Sell bulk junk at your vendor once you empty the NPC vendors cap.limit for the day. 
---
You can also go hunt super mutants as they usually have a hand full of them.
---
It would be interesting. Probably not very good, compared to 2000dmg bloodied deathclaw gauntlet/super sledge builds, but it would at least be good enough to the point where you could kill things and have fun. Guess it doesn't matter though because I doubt they will ever let us have legendary drills
---
No, in the most recent update they added poop monsters that shit on you and make the game unplayable. They also added weird priests with dragon masks kinda like dragon priests that shout weird words at you and crash your game. 10/10 game needs more water.
---
Ya admittadly it's likelyhood is next to 0, but I still like 2 dream.
---
I lowkey think so too, I had never seen the flatwoods monster till 2 days ago nor the mothman who ive encountered twice now. Previously I had 200 something hours without seeing either

I can still hear my dad yelling that, even after being out of my parents house for 14 years now. Still tells me that shit when he comes to my house...
---
Why get on a forum and just lie about stuff? Is it just attention seeking behavior on the part of the OP? If you are having to shoot more than once at a level 7 ghoul with any weapon, then you simply aren't hitting it.
---
In all seriousness, don't forget you can earn xp from cooking/crafting, and can earn additional caps beyond the 1400 daily from vending. 
---
Collect everything, scrap everything. Bulk all extra mats you have, and sell in vending. You're high enough level to farm for Forest disease cure materials (2 firecap, 2 blood leaf, 2 snaptails) you can craft these, and sell in vending pretty easily. Pick 1 gun type (either .38 or .44), and sell all .45, 5.56, .50, and and 5mm you find.
---
Craft everything, cook everything, it adds up quickly. I've probably made 10-20 levels from nothing but crafting xp.
---
As others have said, hunt super mutants and scorched, both are good sources of ammo and steel.   Both are good  sources for xp and vendable materials
---
Definitely would be good. Maybe allow us a smaller camp even 4 foundations radius that doesn't remove our main camp. Just to put a couple benches and stash
---
Lower it's health with a stronger weapon for the final hit shoot or bash it with the syringer. That's how I did it
---
I've experienced invisible enemies (Fort Defiance), enemies in the floor (Morgantown Airport, Belching Betty, Mama Dolces), slow load times etc. as well.
---
I would suggest the possibility that these issues ( that have been seen before ) are being observed more frequently with this event because of something like the number of enemy mobs that spawn?
---
Bad code or bad data causing exceptions that the application can't recover from results in a crash - not the same as missing textures, misplaced enemies, collisions between objects and the floor making holes, etc.
---
I was only trying to help by suggesting some testing that can be done to make sure one possible cause of crashes was addressed.
---
The event isn't a failure. It is one of the best things to happen to the game. We now have an event with actual mechanics that requires us to work together.
---
Building bases is one of my favorite parts of both this game and Fo4. Get outta here with that negativity just because you don’t have the creativity to build a good base
---
It can because I didn't bother to mod it since I was just targeting lower level mobs.
---
Awesome, thought about this but didn't know if it would actually work!
---
Thanks everyone, this helps a lot
---
Nah, it's been going downhill rapidly what with these "recently I logged back in" posts.
---
Haaaa. Dude,  you need to sit back and chill. It's a fucking video game.
---
"maybe if you're a kid"... even a kid doesn't put this much "this is serious business" bullshit onto a game. Chill. Just because a dude shows up with a pipe pistol, doesn't mean he shouldn't get a reward. He paid just as much for the damn game as you did, he's entitled to enjoy it as much as you are. Telling them they have to "Not do this event if you can't do at least X amount of damage" is neckbeard garbage.
---
Whats the bod hood? Where do I get that
---
Ah, that sucks. You'd think of all the things they would make sure it would work with
---
Upper lefthand part of the map.  There are a bunch of Level 10 Super Mutants there, just waiting to be murdered.
---
Cheers to you, I use two characters, both bloodied, one melee and one ranged. On my melee in an event I often times will just switch to unarmed combat as I don’t do much damage there and on my ranged I carry two guns both the same exact build, level actions. However one has the explosive effect used for when I solo and one has a reduced weight effect while on teams in an event. I pop the main and then handle the mobs so others can get their hits in.
---
Gauss rifles suck if you have the grounded mutation as well.
---
Let's be clear, this is a post about *griefers*.  The details are not important, but, yes, the blame does, in fact, belong on these types of players.  They are cancer.  They'll always find a way.
---
The latest one I read, somebody invites you to team, you join, they're not passive, their non-teamed friend is not passive, they start combat with their RL friend, you get tagged wanted, the griefer drops team and he and his fellow lowlife kill you.
---
"Don't take random team invites." What a terrible state, so many opportunities to make new friends, help out a fellow wastelander, gone up in smoke because of these scum.
---
"You don't lose anything." You lose a sense of community, belonging, comradeship.
---
I don't know a fix.  I don't think there is one.  But I refuse to let blame slide on these reprobates just because they are exploiting a weakness in a game.
---
The bleedout barrel worked pretty good.
---
same here. Everything off ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If you have the endangerol mod that will help tons. It nukes the enemy defenses, so one of those, and a few melee thumps will take care of it real easy.
---
'Merica!
---
Just go to Camp Adams at night and go to the camp fire, it'll trigger automatically.  It doesn't show up unless someone goes there.
---
1st, if your on Xbox let me know, I’ll make you some deep pocketed leather armor to give you 50+ carry weight.... 
---
You can sell up to 1400 caps a day... farm the fertile soil event and all of flatwoods as much as you can. Scrap what you need and sell the rest to the vendor in church. 
---
1 fork from restaurant across the way or a burnt book is 1 cap and flatwoods is full of easy cap making stuff. 
---
WV Lumber in the corner (northwest) at your lvl will spawn lvl5-10 super mutants full of caps and stuff you can sell or scrap! 
---
Keep you CAMP small and mobile to place down quickly until you level up! 
---
Anything junk wise in your stash... make sure it is scrapped since it will weigh less!
---
Iv spoted them near the lead mine north of hunters ville, them and mothman frequent the area
---
Yeah, I don't have any currently though.
---
I need more black titanium for that. I unlocked it by scraping a couple syringers. Do you know how long the "unlocked" feature lasts?
---
I thought this was the case.. last few I’ve fought with never landed at all though. I think the biggest thing that gets me is their sonic screech which is impossible to evade.. just rattles my cage. I’m also heavily melee geared so I can kill them in a few seconds on the ground; I just get chewed out if they don’t land!
---
Bash it!
---
Someone posted on YouTube if you fast travel somewhere else and run to Arktos it won't crash. Something about fast traveling directly to Arktos or server hopping there causes crashing. Riflegaming I think
---
Its a Nocturnal Faster Fire rate and +1 Perception Tesla Rifle
---
One character I have has max CHA. 
---
My others have a few.
---
My one major gripe with FO76 is summed up in this thread. The game rewards a single style of play.
---
I think they should just give some love to the poor, red headed step-bow we have now. :(
---
Sorry, I got a killer headache last night and had to go to bed early.  But I'll be on and off today. I'll try to make sure I'm on in the evening (I'm in Mountain time)
---
Shotguns had their damage over distance changed recently. Shotgun now do crap damage overall at anything but up close and personal. So 20% of crap is still crap.
---
VERY ANNOYING
---
One point for fast travel.  I dont care about XP at this point (level 415), so I go with the minimum.
---
Clarifications: DoTs (including but not limited to bleed and poison) do not ignore armor. They have their own DR associated with them that may or may not be available in-game. Bleeds (wounding) stacks and there is currently no bleed resistance available in-game. Poison damage does not stack and there is a legendary effect available for armor pieces that grant resistance to it (Poisoner's). Fire damage has at least two forms (Direct: explosive and ground effects. Incendiary: DoT). Incendiary damage does not stack. There is resistance available in-game for both types of fire damage in the form of a single perk card (Fireproof in endurance). Note: Explosive damage inherits the primary damage type of the weapon.
---
Bash damage while having it equipped counts as a kill😀
---
On which platforms do you two play :)?
---
I'll be on off and on today.  But I'll try to make sure I'm on this evening (I'm Mountain time)
---
They should just add music to Roses station, maybe add abit more dialogu for her, like maybe announcements as u said, and have it be the Raider radio. Play mostly rockabilly and some Red eye type stuff.
---
THEY GO BOOM!
---
What more is needed?
---
The Possum Scouts are your friends! :)
---
I used the Yaogui that spawns at Dolly Sod's. I lowered it a decent amount, then kited it by jumping on top of the Information sign you spawn near when you fast travel there. Wasn't too terribly bad.
---
Ticket wise you’ll get a response of “we are unable to replace lost items...” submit a bug report if anything.
---
What system do you play on?
---
You..carry a shovel? ARE THERE LEGENDARY SHOVELS?
---
Exactly it’s a video game, not everyone is a winner. Sorry if you come in second place
---
I'll be off and on today.  But I'll try to be on this evening (I'm Mountain time).
---
I have 5, but going to trade a point out on the next level. I need travel agent and lone wanderer. 
---
Other perks cans be traded in and out at trading booths or the like. I might even drop to 3 points to make sure all the combat points are active. And swap cards for casual activities.
---
There is also a heated coil mod for the power fist but you can only learn it by finding the plan for it. I got mine from doing Census Violence.
---
So you sell worthless junk to people.  Its been confirmed they still don't drop from Honeybeasts.
---
For me, I just don't find drunkenness to be as innately funny as the makers of this game seem to, whether it's Biv or the two months of alcohol-related challenges.
---
I got modern kitchen tables... i unlocked the shitty ones that i would not call modern... i would call them cafeteria tables.
---
Start of the game bought the plans for a radium rifle thinking it would be something cool.... sounds cool.. na its shit.
---
Bought brick building set... got something else (that was an actual bug that has since been patched)
---
Now i just google shit before throwing caps away unless its a player vendor selling it for 25 caps.
---
Surprised no one is seemingly using Tenderizer.
---
Another idea for variety, instead of having 1 strong boss, have many weaker bosses that swarm everyone with overwhelming numbers.
---
I always killed him for his clothes....
---
Sent it in a PM
---
1
---
I haven't.
---
To be honest, this is very much like Bethesda overall.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game. That statement absolutely applies here. The game shouldn't punish the player for having high damage output and it shouldn't punish people in the area helping out because they couldn't get a hit in.
---
It’s the hood Paladin Danse wore in Fo4. I bought it from a guy here on Reddit. It looks like a cap a pilot would wear under their helmet
---
I’ve been playing since the beta and yes, it’s improved greatly! Are there still issues and new ones? Yes, of course! 
---
Plenty to do overall and I agree the players seem overall a lot nicer mainly due to vending but a lot of great peeps in the wasteland!
---
Hahaaaaahahaaa.
---
Dude.  you do you. If this is how you get a feeling of accomplishment in your life, so be it. You go be King Fallout, I hope it makes up for whatever is lacking in your life.
---
This happened to me a while back, had to clear cache.
---
Fort Defiance has like a dozen bags. If you visit daily, you should never need ballistic fiber again. It also happens to be great exp and cap farm location.
---
Weight decreasing or endurance perks, because the more you can carry or the more damage you can take from the environment or enemies the better (just my suggestion)
---
Sounds like you got some shitty aim
---
*tap tap*
---
Hmm, I think the calendar function is broken...
---
mah man, thank you
---
I have to agree with you there. For endusers like me it seems easy, which it is definetly not,  for a program to  repeatedly going through the database of current occurrence and and process string for words and pass the result to google vouce like module and tadaaaaa..... radio announcement in robot voice.
---
BUT its not easy as it is imagined to be, i understand. Just endusers and their imaginations thinking its just a few point and clicks  😅
---
If you are on Xbox I will take that lever action rifle off your hands if you don't want it. Tag is Th4tsFakeNews

I feel as though I should not be taking a seat and maybe it is the world around me that needs to.

This one is my fav (preparing for downvotes) https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/572990040653692940/576986932207157258/this_game.png
---
If we could have a big one and a small one that would be really cool, but I don't think we should hold our breath.
---
My understanding is that only first two levels available.
---
I can't remember a single on that i find funny or clever. Apparently Emil wrote all of them so that makes perfect sense.
---
Take out 98% health with other weapons, and bash that last 2% with a pipe rifle equipped
---
Cripple wings and proceed to kill it in a few seconds with your melee.
---
I came here expecting it to be a .GIF of "get over it" or "then don't do it" variety.
---
Pleasantly surprised.  Nice post!
---
It's Rifleman.
---
Don't forget to also pick up military grade duct tape which also contains ballistic fiber.
---
monster...
---
Good to know. Hopefully I can recall reading this next time I see him
---
Your comparison still doesn't make sense. There are traffic rules for a good reason. You can cause serious incidents in real life when breaking rules. I really hope you understand the differences between real life and game world.
---
Thanks for asking this and making me think about Charisma. For ages I’ve had 4 points in Charisma for Lone Wanderer, but in fact I haven’t used Lone Wanderer for many, many levels. Enemies just aren’t tough enough once you have your build and play style sorted. 
---
So this frees up a SPECIAL point I could use elsewhere. I’m thinking I’ll change to 3 points for Hard Bargain but honestly I don’t even need that maxed. Now with player vending I’m not often selling to bot vendors anymore. Maybe I can go to 2 points in Charisma!
---
Hi there! Don't apologize for tagging that's why I am here for :)
---
We are aware of the localization issues and are working to get this fixed ASAP! I hope to have an update on the timing for this soon.
---
I’ve not launched a nuke, isn’t he a bunker AI? That would work, but I don’t see any reason he would connect to the radio station.
---
I get it.  Looking for a little strange after being stuck in with all us Vault 111 peeps.
---
Still, ew.
---
Mirelurk Queens, &amp; Sheepsquatch
---
I can 1 hit a level 91 Deathclaw but the MQ takes a lot of ammo, and sometimes Stimpaks, the fact that one can take down 2 or 3 SBs and still be over 50% health kind of says it all, and I see this frequently near my Camp in the Cranberry Bog.
---
That’s exactly what they were getting at. They mindlessly bought into the statement that they literally copy pasted all the animations ai etc and that’s just factually incorrect. He’s gullible.
---
I found the plan at watoga station for handmade if that helps
---
I didn’t know this was an option, will this stop it flying completely??
---
I agree with you, the video alone doesn't prove anything.  I was under the impression using Unyeilding to raise agility would make me harder to detect while sneeking...but I've not had the results I was hoping for.  After seeing this argument for Chameleon I'm willing to experiment with it and see.  So far I'm gathering leather armor since that's the only one I know Shadowed for.  Will Shadowed skew the results??  I don't know.  
---
My goal is to slip back into Caution easier.  If I run away and hide behind a corner I would like to go into Caution...which is what I thought Escape Artist was going to do, but most of the time I feel like that point would do more good in Adrenaline, just stay on the ofensive.
---
It's playing with these different strategies that keeps me coming back night after night, lol.  If my character becomes "finished" I will likely just stop playing and find another challenge.
---
After reading replies, I am confused as to why anyone would be motivated to do this.  I have one or two "legendary" items for sale, then a ton of just about everything else.  Players are buying my trash.  Although the idea is clearly unpopular, the idea came because I  wanted some recognition for my efforts as a vendor.  I designed my layout and inventory to be pleasing for other players. The game sucks travel caps anyway, why not the destination.  Anyway, on sale (today only) a slice of perfectly perserved pie 500c.
---
They cannot be traded or sold.

I hope you can see how hyperbole can be used to make a point.
---
But hey, if you wish to take this literally, that's on  you.
---
Aaaaahhoooooo!
---
To be fair, it's a game developers responsibility to prevent issues like this.
---
Oh well, I tried :D
---
Unless you fire at them or hit them, players can’t do anything to your camp or you. There’s no slap damage. 
---
Make sure pacifist is on and ignore them. 
---
Also them lock picking anything will make your turrets fire at them which instigates PvP I believe... so just leave it unlocked. 
---
There are many butt hurt players made about not being able to grieve players and destroy camps so they are trying to instigate PvP with you which will allow them to fight you.
---
&gt; 1,967,657 deaths to the Imposter Sheepsquatch. 
---
Wow.
---
Now someone start making spurious calculations to work out how many people are playing the game.  :)
---
3 CHR
---
Solo: 3☆ Lone survivor
---
Team: 1☆ Strange in numbers, 2☆ Squad Maneuver
---
And 3☆ hard bargain for buying/selling
---
Mostly solo here and i have 6 in charisma. 3 for party boy and 2 lone wanderer and 1 travel agent. I know i could swap out travel agent for another point of LW but thats tedious. When grouped i typically swap LW for strange in numbers, tenderizer or rad sponge depending on situation or what my buddy shares
---
Exactly damnit CATER TO MY SOCIAL ANXIETY YOU FUCKS *OR SO HELP ME*
---
Don't take Poseidon, take thunder mountain instead, I find less people interested in that side of the map
---
You got the tag correct! Survival is still in BETA, so we're still actively looking at ways to change and improve this mode. I'll comb through all these comments for each side and be sure to pass this feedback along as well.

You're coming in last place with that shit outlook. Those "freeloaders" don't affect you, so pay them no mind. Arguing against changes that would be beneficial to "contributors" so you can get your rocks off punishing "freeloaders" is completely illogical. 
---
INB4 you start talking about participation trophies you fucking incel haha.
---
In about 8 hours, yeah, after I’m off work. Look me up if no one else has come through by then. IGN Tazier
---
Count me in too

I agree, because it's much more rewarding to fight and kill all 50 ghouls than it is to feel like wasting ammo on a giant enemy
---
I’m on ps4
---
Add me, I'll help you: Spartaner-043
---
Nothing is real.  We are all in a simulation.  Someone at Vault Tec screwed up and forgot to save the time progression.
---
In reality, the date is probably reset to keep things consistent.  Different servers are set in different times.  You'd be bouncing around in time every time you server hopped.  The devs probably thought that'd be more confusing.  Or it was just easier on the servers to reset the date at login.  They could track the time client side, but I'm sure someone would figure out a way to exploit that.
---
Last I seen people were mad about legendary crap. Like imagine all you get are drills.
---
My God... it looks like flying spiders from Hell
---
Also, be sure to have your maxed out White Knight perk card on to reduce the amount of ballistic fiber required for the repair. This helps a lot!
---
Because I make an effort to give other players a good experience while visiting my shop.  From the design layout, inventory and pricing.  It's all about you the customer.  The travel gods take their caps, why not me the lowely merchant?
---
Yea I need to put some points into that
---
Same here.  It's either max Hard Bargain or split with 2 Lone Wanderer and Travel Agent.
---
No prob! Glad it helped!
---
Hear hear!
---
I played with a dude that had a nickname like Valkyrieof_Seidr the other day. He dropped a nuke and we met at the nuke zone and then ventured into the burrows. Him being so helpful and friendly really and truly helped me suffer through some severe depression the last few days. 
---
If you read this, friend, please send me a PM. I would love to add you just to talk every now and again.
---
On PC?  I'd be looking for one of the Formula P plans.  Might help keep the animals alive in future attempts.
---
Yep. 5 CHA. 4 for Lone Wanderer. and 1 Tenderizer. Plus when you switch to grouping you can add the +CHA in group perk card and share a lvl 2 card.
---
Of course... those 50's dad jokes make my day too.
---
If we dont get biv to voice this i will drop all of my legendaries at charleston
---
Another anecdotal observation - I hopped the teapot for at least three hours over 3 days with no results.  Moved on to mothman museum in point pleasant today.  After 10th strike out there I fast travelled to wavy willards and the tourist was there waiting for me.  I've read that the tourist doesn't pop immediately upon load in, and while I can't directly corroborate that, my experience does support that theory.  If I were to do it again I would check multiple locations per hop rather than hopping a single location.
---
Your argument is a bit like comparing dogs to cats. Both have 4 legs so both can be called as cats.
---
I spawned into a locked camp... had to fast travel out to see their vending machines
---
I think I maxed most of those but need to go back and check. Since I scavenge I tend to carry a lot on me.
---
Nothing is real....,
---
Definitely do, swap it in and out just when you’re repairing, it’ll save a lot of ballistic fiber
---
I've been wanting this for a while as well - tho I thought it would have been a neat addition to the backpack to have the ability to scrap on the move or lay down a sleeping bag real quick that won't give you a disease if you want to grab that small well rested XP boost when leveling. It would also be great for low levels who would like to have a home base near a quest hub like top of the world or flatwoods but still be able to use work benches while on the go because you do pick up a lot of junk and should be scrapping a lot of weapons at that point to learn new mods etc.
---
Wow, that was the most condescending post I've read in awhile. I agree with a lot of it, but damn man, tone it down a bit.
---
Depends on what the bullet sponge drops.
---
Real answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
It's literally Fallout 4 but online, With a few changes cause it's online obviously but yeah if you liked 4 then you'll like this
---
Yes.
---
I've seen it happen (to me) but it only lasts for a couple of seconds.
---
**T**oday **I** **L**earned or in your case Today You Learned what TIL stands for.
---
I’ll play with thou. PSN: erickj75. Also, voice chat doesn’t work for me so we will have to be in party
---
And you'll need PSN (It's pretty much a MMO)
---
Get somebody to join your friends list -- you can just spam randoms with friends requests, maybe someone will join.
---
When you have a friend, and they're online, use the "join" option to get on the same server as them, drop the stuff you want to move to another server into a container (cigarette machines are good, they appear to have no weight limit), log off, change characters then "join" as the new character.
---
You're screwed if
---
1. someone sees you doing it and steals your stuff before you can reconnect or
---
2. your "friend" logs off before you can reconnect or
---
3. the server crashes.
---
But those should be pretty rare.
---
Highly build specific. My stealth sniper would prefer the "bullet sponge" (and 2-3 shot it). My heavy gunner would mow down the horde.
---
For me after 300 hours it’s pretty boring. I have all weapons and armor I need. So there’s not much to grind for.
---
That’s what I do with all of my other perks, I wish I could have a preset building card set
---
I get most of your points, other than bullet sponge, I've only gotten to final stage once out of the few times I've done if,  and honestly the boss creature isn't so bad. Worst part I find is everyone playing with exploding automatic wepons in there. Makes visibility almost 0 and causes massive lag. PSA: Plz try to use any wepon other than explosives while around water.
---
Wow, that's really unfortunate.  Especially the SBQ fight, which at this point shouldn't be much of an issue.
---
Thanks ! It's great to have that level of feedback.
---
3 guns use .308: Hunting Rifle, LMG, and Pipe Bolt-action.
---
Ty mate,there were nukes luckily,meanwhile i have some now.
---
4 for the sole wanderer perk
---
Sending you a request now.  Join the server I'm on and fast travel to me, I'll be at my camp and I'll craft you one to scrap.
---
People are also spending time outside of the normal FT areas, with vending and new events. It may just be more exposure has led to more chances at a contact.
---
(spoiler)(/s "yes")
---
&gt; If you want my money then give me walls
---
... don't fence me in.

Hide behind a tree it’ll take the hit of the attack
---
Drink water from a pump. With 0 rr its 5 rads. With radx its 1 rads. So if its inbetween there ya go.
---
Really? I thought it was AoE :/
---
DC gauntlet is a 6-10k cap item. AA sword is probably a 1-2k item.
---
A lot of good points here, I tried the event last night for the first time, there were 4 other players and myself, I chose Habitat B, and gathered stuff quickly, killing Snallygasters, and Molerats that were spawning everywhere, another player joined me about 70% through the 1st phase, and all enemies respawned at once, they died, I nearly died, but mamanged to keep filling the device, then got a Bloatfly to defend.
---
The 1st wave wasn't so bad, Belle (The Bloatfly) went to a corner and we were able to defend easily, other players lost their friendly in the first wave and joined us for the second which caused an obnoxious amount of spawns including a Mirelurk King that quickly killed Belle (who had not yet been hit once), at considerable range, so the event failed, and the only legendary that ever appeared quickly disappeared upon death.
---
I will not be returning again until I have a full 8-9 player group in Party Chat.
---
Thank
---
4, usually either Party Boy/girl + Tenderizer 1, Hard bargain 3+ Travel cost reduction or full Lone wanderer.
---
Depends on situation.
---
The NCR ranger armor is just LAPD riot armor with a trenchcoat, it's not a stretch for this kind of armor to be present elsewhere.
---
Does it count if its covered in the blood of supermutants? (Its actually one of my fav weapons to farm the supermutants in the NE of the map)
---
Aside from that I mostly have it because of the daily in Philips cemetery, most often when I arrive the shovel is already gone.
---
It be nice but people will just abuse it for storage then. Also, We don't need more space, to some people it will Never be enough and will ask for more eventually. Its all about balance and management of resources which is a part of the game. I would rather have a real pet/companion system, real potted plants and some more choices in foundation shapes/restrictions then to further water down an aspect to camp management because.

[Spoiler](/s "Yes")

I went with five and just left travel agent in all the time. I fast travel a lot and knew I would never swap it out
---
No, not at all. 
---
My argument is that blaming someone else for you actions is bullshit.
---
I wouldn't have gotten fat if McDonald's cheeserburgers weren't so high in calories. It's your fault you ate so fuckin many of them.
---
I wouldn't speed if cars didn't go that fast. Your fault, you chose to speed.
---
Not at all like "motorcycles and cars have wheels so both are wheelbarrows".
---
You're arguing for the sake of arguing now. You just want to be right. One-shotting shit in the game is douchebag behaviour. The fact you CAN does not make it right. The fact you CAN is the same logic used by dupers and griefers and exploiters always.
---
You know those are other players. You know they're there to participate and get drops. You CHOOSE to be a dick and intentionally take that opportunity away from them.
---
That isn't Bethesda's "fault". Take some fucking ownership.
---
Whoops... I feel bad now I had no idea I was stealing all those crops
---
Migrating points over time is just way too tedious and defeats the purpose of having it there in the first place. It's far quicker to just create a new character.
---
I really love this. Like a lot. I don’t have a headset so all my communications are through chat (on XB1 so it’s a real pain) and I’ve been okay with it because I prefer solo play and don’t want to hear all the background chatter. But this makes me feel like maybe I’m missing out. I’m sorry you’re struggling. I hope things feel better for you soon.
---
There's a definite reason he would. [Spoiler](/s "He's the enclave AI")
---
Not sure if it’s a glitch for the SBQ or what but last few times she’s been on the ground 85%+ of the time so players dump ammo into her. 
---
Still a great farm location unless it glitches and everything disappears like all the meat piles... that happens a lot!
---
Nope trees can Block that sonar crap thing but not the cloud of shit
---
I even heard the long pause after “This just in!!”
---
You can also get the plan for the Stimpak Diffuser from this event! Got it yesterday after the event ended with all 3 animals alive
---
Oh shoot, thanks for reminding me on that one, I'll add it to the list.
---
Stabby the birthday hook-clown
---
When you know the plan to craft the tesla rifle it’s in the heavy weapons category with the .50 cal, minigun etc.
---
Make a new character and build and only focus on that character as your new main that's what I do it give alot. Ire playability especially running more difficult builds for more of a challenge.
---
Non sentinal/cavalier, or Combat/Marine, you can safely ask 800 - 1200 for it, in my experience. You can ask for more and hope someone buys it, but if you just want to turn it over, keep it in the mid price range.
---
My TSE gauss gives 650+ damage with my health at 20% (bloodied sniper build).
---
How the charging works? it double the damage?
---
Not if you're low level... them ghouls can easily RIP you a new one at level 10 when they spawn as level 65
---
Yeah, no.
---
*  The New Vegas sign is a landmark in the Atomic Command mini-game
---
* Deacon mentions Mr. House when he talks to Deezer
---
* One of the Robobrains in Far Harbor mentions Vera Keyes
---
* Sunset Sarsaparilla is mentioned in Nuka-World (Nuka Cola Wild was an  attempt at directly competing against Sarsaparilla), and Nuka Victory  and Quartz make an appearance
---
* Fixer is mentioned in a terminal at Med-Tek
---
* Cabot mentions an alien city under the Mojave
---
* The slot machines introduced in the Vault DLC are pretty much identical to NV's slot machines.
---
All of this just in Fallout 4. So much for pretending that NV doesn't exist, huh.
---
Charisma? What's that
---
I have 3.
---
  2 lone wanderer and 1 tenderizer.
---
I usually don’t have strong enough wills to hold myself from a spoiler, but I’m gonna take your word for it and say he’d be a good fit, but I’d still like to see rose comment on the nukes sometime after the drop.
---
That’s the thing lol my 3rd character is my main now but it’s already lvl 148 with everything I need.
---
I use a build that can kill lot of things pretty quickly. I try to be careful but sometimes shit hapens. Especialy with gun fu and i dont notice that its a legendary.
---
This is promenent in the chaotic environment that is the pharma event. It is much more managable in say uranium fever where there are less mobs and players.
---
So a solution might be make all non boss loot shared. Bosses being the alpha predator, or the sheepsquatch. Boss loot requires tagging of the boss and certain damage done to it. and event rewards require a certain percentage of total damage done during the event.
---
Often better rewards than some random one-star legendary, too.
---
I don't really care if I get a shot at the Alpha in the new Arktos event.  I just want the plans.
---
I don’t even own doors and my vending is outside!
---
This game has changed 1000% since launch. I have to say, at first it was really like playing a fallout game, just a fallout game where they replaced all of the NPC's with the cast from Jersey Shore. It was like actually being a part of the show, only in the post apocolypse. LIterally nothing but super mutant jabronies with overcooked rad tans and terrible haircuts. My first Queen fight, I thought there a bunch of LARPERS performing a live action reinactment of transformers 4. But when I finally got within mic range, the jabronies were really all strutting around like peacocks wearing volkswagon beetles, and trying to sex up the Snooki Beast Queen. It was kinda off putting, let me tell you. Anyway, in season two, the devs really upped their game. I'm guessing some of them are real big anime fans, (which would kinda explain why every player is now a big buxom girl?) because the graphics, IMHO, took a real down turn. I never pictured a post apocolyptic world to be so bright and cartoony, but if the devs say so, I guess it's canon now. I kind of wish they would have left the super mutants alone, and not changed them all to mutacorns. And I don't think it was necessary for the scorched virus to be changed to a sparkly glitter dust, but thats why I'm not a dev, making the big bucks.
---
Anyway, if that sounds like fun, you should join our My Little Pony role playing group, we meet every Tuesday. You will have to find your own Sparkly Happy Princess Pony outfit (not to be confused with the Happy Sparkly Princess outfit, those guys are all @ssh*les.), but you can usually find one by server hopping Harper's Ferry 6, or 700 times.
---
All the kids from the FortniteBR subreddit somehow made their way over here...
---
This is amazing! Nicework.
---
Thanks again, as a carnivor I wasn't growing crops, now only recently to brew, but not on claimed workshops, I'll grow some as a decoy.
---
Thanks for sharing your feedback! I've seen this in the past and mentioned it before but will make sure it resurfaces :)
---
For the B habitat, the rank 1 friend is a charred ghoul.
---
The actual round the gauss fires is ballistic. They are just little metal balls I think. But the gauss uses energy to propel the ballistic projectile so it’s technically a hybrid by using energy to fire a ballistic round.
---
I would join but I'm on Xbox. I tired to do this the other day and got 11 Workshops. I got DC and had to rejoin the lobby, managed to keep 6 of them but had to recapture the rest. ITs a fun endeavor. Dont worry about defending them all from npc attacks you can go back and clear them out after you take them all. My tip, just using the Workshop budget and none of your own scrap just build rocket turrets and power near the workshop control point and sometimes they will clear the defence missions for you. Best of luck!
---
Oh haha sorry, all good!

This community is toxic tho. Once you get past level 200 you are hated and unwelcome on this sub Reddit . I like to keep up with current events in game so I read here a lot . I'm rarely comfortable posting because as soon as I start reading it's hate hate hate on anyone higher than 100 . If you're 2 or 3 hundred you're just a puppy killing psycho with no life that must be a virgin alien. Go ahead give me those delicious down votes, I've acquired the taste for them . Extra salty like McDonald's fries in a brown bag that I add several packs of salt to.
---
Lets face it, the fallout fanbase has always had some fully grown kids in it
---
It's like Butcher Pete if he was from the Death World of Krieg...
---
 Also I figured it was for that event as it's the only logical reason I could imagine someone would carry a shovel for. Shame we can't have legendary shovels. :I
---
5. Not 4.
---
This is for Lone wanderer + Travel Agent.
---
Swap around for Hard Bargain/Happy Camper etc as needed.
---
I wish we could be our own DJs and broadcast a signal. That would be so damn cool.
---
Exactly im saying cap it anywhere from 100-200 caps per kill
---
You deserve whatever punishment comes your way
---
Plans are entirely my motivation. Everything else is just a medium for me to afford to buy more plans!
---
At level 10 head to Grafton... do the 2 events that spawn there, grafton parade day and protesters, and then mop up the super mutants. In all honesty you shouldn't be grinding for xp and caps that early... there is plenty of action following the main quest line (and the side line events along the way) that mean you should pick up xp and caps (that you get for events and quests alone).
---
Added, thanks c:
---
You're from 111? Luuuuuucky. 
---
 I got shoved in 76 with a bunch of sociopaths!
---
One day, we're all celebrating our freedom from sterilized tunnels, talking about rebuilding the country.
---
 By the end of the week Chad has a fresh face hole and somebody is talking about dropping nukes on tourist spots.
---
Then all I can say is do a new build again lol honestly the grind up and through endgame is the most fun part too me I dont get bored until it gets to where everything is killable in on shot and I'm invincible damn near.
---
You and me both, and the rest of the community! It gets old swapping just a few cards for crafting, better prices, fast traveling, etc.
---
This could be avoided if everyone in the event area was able to loot enmies without tagging them...
---
Actually, I wouldn’t love that. Now, a SENTRY BOT radio DJ, that I would love.
---
I think personal radio stations would be nice. You get the plans to build a radio tower then upload a play list. The people you share the server with can tune in and hear that playlist! And vice versa of course.
---
As cliche as it is, I'm a hill billy. I'll keep walking until I can't and then I'll crawl.
---
If you need someone to talk to, **please** feel free to message me.
---
Yea I really wish they will add something like that soon
---
Whiteprings Bunker guard house. I visit there often has two static spawns plus sometimes a random one in a container.
---
I might start selling ballistic fiber ad I'm a stealth sneak and do not get hit a lot.
---
You did good in going bad.
---
Haha I support this
---
Leveling a new character is faster than reallocating points? In what world? Reallocating your points and rechoosing your perks is gonna take like 5, MAYBE 10 minutes.
---
What
---
Where did you find the plan for the extra claw mod? I've crafted/scrapped like 50 deathclaw gauntlets without learning it or are you saying you have the mod for it? 
---
I have also found a Deathclaw Gauntlet sitting on a table in the Sons of Dane compound - it's on the table close to the back door by the instruments. Other weapons spawn there so just don't pick those up. 
---
I found the powerfist plan in one of the 3 level 3 safes that are at a graveyard at Lewisbrug(?) pretty sure. That's also where I got the deathclaw gauntlet plan. Don't take anything out of the safe and server hop until you get the plans you want - take lots of bobby pins
---
Yes. I have 7 points of luck and am constantly swapping. Luck of the draw is a fgavorite of mine too. 
---
I'm looking forward tol getting a refrigerated backpack so that I can swap out my good with salt for something else.
---
The listed damage is what you get fully charged. If you don't charge it you get about half the listed damage.
---
xbox by chance?
---
It's not entirely clear in the event prompts, but immediately upon activating both keypads, run inside and push the red button. The event will succeed even without indicating the next step.
---
You only have like 2 seconds between each activation, so make sure to sprint.
---
I'm usually not in the mood to laugh after getting a rank 1 hacker card for the sixth time, so not really.
---
Last update we saw a massive change. Everyone starts at level 500 with maxed out all specials and every perk card. Instead of earning xp, you lose xp for everything you do. Every ten levels you lose you choose a perk point to give up. Endgame is level 1 with 55 special points. After hitting zero xp, you start losing caps instead, but there is no longer a vendor cap limit so you have to be constantly selling gear otherwise you run out of caps. They did this because everyone kept complaining about respec being too slow and inefficient, and to combat hoarding.
---
Stopped reading them months ago Im afraid. I do like the gum though.
---
What kinda cheapskate shit are you on? 1400 caps a day is minimum wage, plenty for travel.
---
That sounds absolutely terrible what the fuck
---
I am, but they both sold already.
---
Well, yea, it's supposed to be there for people who are attached to a single character and don't mind putting the time in, not an option that's there so any character can be any build instantly.
---
The mechanical diversity of builds in this game is already crappy as it is. There is no meaningful distinction between different combat roles or deeper team play or anything. They should work on expanding that sort of thing instead of completely killing it off.
---
Spread the word my friend, i thought it was an accurate term too :P
---
I don't disagree with many of your points, but disagree calling it a failure.  
---
My big complaint is that the disabling of the computer doesn't truly give any benefit that I see.  It disables a few robots, sure, but those aren't all that dangerous ultimately.  What it does significantly though is make the freaking experiments HOSTILE to the Alpha, meaning they'll run right to it and their deaths catastrophically causing the event to fail.  If disabling the computer does that, it needs to significantly increase the reward since the risk has been significantly increased.
---
It's us snipers taking out their wings that forces them to land for a while.
---
5K caps is WAY too many. It's just a Respec, not activating God mode. Otherwise, I do agree with your suggestion.
---
We could do a rotating cast! Sometimes it's Rosie sometimes it's biv sometimes it's some random super mutant that found a radio station and started pushing buttons!
---
I’m thinking it will be low resources all around especially food which wood make sense... low light so perkcard you play for sun won’t work that kind of stuff...
---
Bethesda made enemies so easy that they are easy to kill, but we shouldn't kill them easily because we want to create a illusion where enemies are harder by using only low tier weapons? People need to start thinking when killing some enemies if it is weak? In these cases people need to throw rocks or talk enemies to the death instead.
---
When using your traffic example it is like driving a car in 80mph speed limit area and seeing the cyclist on the roadside cycling about 30mph. Driver have to slow down and drive as fast as cyclist, because in other case the driver of the car would be a total dick by driving faster than cyclist.
---
My favourite: Dyslexia have might you think you do?
---
Legitimately hurts to read.
---
You pick up the radio, and quickly toss it into the nearby creek, silencing it forever, before you can get caught in another "rescue" quest.
---
Biv would be the best freaking radio host
---
//BURP o hhey you guys -I think there's might be so-something... going on in the cranberry bog? i don't know it looks (HIC) like a bat... a very big bat
---
As an avid scripter, I say you're overthinking it. The info is already compiled, since that's what the map scrapes to present it in various forms. Use the same source and feed it into a text-to-speech converter. Sure, it would sound robotic and contrived, but....... all the NPCs are robots, so who cares?
---
I'd love more clarification on nukes and public events.  I see them on my map, then I pay 20 caps to go there, and the icon is suddenly gone and nobody is around.  I then teleport away, look at my map, and the huge circle is back and people seem to be there.  What am I missing?
---
I love it when this happens, because more enemies to kill!
---
Ooooh but Whitespring only has 7 holes! 
---
For real though I love this idea and would be so hyped to see it implemented
---
Again: [https://imgur.com/a/RaYbOPe](https://imgur.com/a/RaYbOPe) 
---
That's my character, out of combat, without adrenaline or anything else of the sort, at 1071 damage per swing. I put 800 as a *low* estimate. I'm pretty sure if I stacked every buff and every corner case circumstance, I might be able to double that 800 figure, if not more, but I used 800 as a lowballed everyday figure because I cannot count on having every buff 100% of the time, nor can I count on having my hp low enough to get every bonus from a bloodied build.
---
But, again, this is against level 60+ super mutants, which I would be surprised (but not *that* surprised) that a level 40 PC would run up against, but as a character that regularly breaks the 1k damage threshold it takes me two attacks to put them down. Now compare that against someone who can't break the 100 damage per attack threshold and you should find that these characters are bullet sponges (see the armor vs damage equations implicit within the very link I linked above, on how more damage in one attack is better than an equal amount of damage spread over multiple attacks).
---
Math man, how does it work?\[
---
That DJ in Far Cry 4 was awesome talking about Pagan Min and all kinds of silly things.
---
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?
---
I REALLY don't think disabling the computer is worth it.  Disabling a few robots is NOT worth making the experiments hostile, as they will charge right up to the Alpha and die with one or two hits causing you to fail the mission.
---
Same to you :)
---
I creep around the mire with my cowboy hat, survivalist outfit, and now plague doctor mask.  I am the creepy bird man cannibal of the swamp.  I'm loving it.
---
the AA is a great feature.  
---
There are two mods you can apply - electrified and serrated blade. 
---
Depending on build, adding those two will boost the damage to around 100.
---
I think that legendary bosses in events should be "event" enemies, that reward the player with the loot if they participate in the event
---
Well, I server jumped and came across the event but no one joined.  I tried to do it by myself but got destroyed. 
---
I can only sneak so much before that alert sound from Metal Gear Solid goes off in my head. :)

---
Attention Members.
---
Oh yeah, almost each and every person I've met in the game is incredibly friendly and pleasant. They're always quick to offer a wave or a thumbs up at least, if not travel and quest with you (especially if you're a lower level). Of course, there's always going to be an occasional ass that shits in the punch bowl but you'll have that no matter what you do.
---
The game itself has gotten better and there's a ton of new and incredibly cool stuff to do. There's still server crashes and the like but they seem to come and go.
---
I don't run it very often, but I also ran it last night with no luck.
---
You should go around preaching about global warming and why it is a bad idea to launch nukes and the toll it has on the environment.
---
&gt; There is a word for gamers like you, it's called a minmaxer,
---
I can think of a few different words to be honest, but yeah, lets stick with minmaxer
---
I got 5 last time I went, it's all rng.
---
However, don’t try to convince me the world isn’t flat.  I’ve been to the edges of the earth.
---
Nice.
---
You've just inspired me to so something similar.
---
Its random i believe
---
1) Go to  [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) 
---
2) Click "Hide All" then "Power Armor" so only Power Armor locations are showing.
---
3) Avoid any that say "Power Armor: Raider". The ones that specify raider are always raider, the ones that don't are always T-45, T-51B, or T-60.
---
Watoga is best - there are four spawn points within seconds of each other, three more within a few hundred meters.
---
I think what he means is that there already is no character identity, so respecing to get the build that you, as the player, wants, isn't going to harm anything. Yes Fallout games should have more chapter identity and if they did, I would agree with your take on respecing. But in the current version of Fallout, specifically Fallout 76, just let us Respec.
---
No no his great great great great great great great great (?) grandpa No Dogs
---
I don’t mind talking to people, but I work like 10-12 hours a day 7 days a week, I don’t feel like talking after that. Just give me a damn text chat please.
---
I would willingly pay for a radio station so Bethesda can take it \^\^
---
National isolated array and emit mountain disposal will   Pretty consistently give you T-51 and T-60 pieces but at lvl 50.   There is a good YouTube video showing the exact locations.   I server hopped a bit and then would just check most nights and got both sets in about a week.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen something like this in another person's CAMP.   It was like a starship and they had a number of lights that would flash momentarily.  I don't know if they were Cycling Lights, but it stood to reason that any light could be made to blink.
---
Mmmm immersion
---
I'm sending Lela over to thank you for posting this, Captain.
---
If there's anyone on PS4 handy, I'd be interested in a similar rank (mid-40's) traveling buddy to bust this and the burrows out Monday night at about 10pm Eastern.
---
Ah, so just a continuation of my good run of bad luck then? Ok, I cam deal with that, I thought may be there was some kind of strategy to it or something I needed to do to have them drop.  Thanks for the answer mate!
---
*sweating feverishly* uhh that's a nice uh *coughs* uh likeness you have there.

I think i heard of a possible BR mode eventually. I was looking foward to the fortnite pve mode. I hate BR games
---
Someone told me about this reddit post, it's awesome that so many people have learned from my video.  Hopefully random players will stop ending these events.  Thank you for paying it forward  [u/NIKwithoutaC](https://www.reddit.com/user/NIKwithoutaC/) :D
---
I guess you could call this a stag do?
---
Yes it can. Flechette harpoon gun shoots 1 harpoon but can pic up 7 harpoons.
---
Because of a bug, non-english players can see challenges of nuclear winter. I can tell you, it will not be a BR Mode. But I don't want to spoiler more.
---
I will try this tonight.
---
Sounds a bit like the thing Destiny 2 does for different planets, I like the sound of the idea.
---
Same - 4 Lone Wanderer or Hardbargin 3 and Travel Agent.
---
Have you met any of the robots in Appalachia? Such as Quercus in Arktos or ARIC-4 in Arktos? Both have obvious personalities. What about the handy in the mire that has programmed to be anxious and afraid of bees so much so there's an event to help him with the bees lol Rose has been programmed to be well - Rose.
---
Are these technically personalities? No. But they're still interesting and different enough that they would be fun to listen to on the radio.
---
BR ?
---
green means it's materials already in the workshop and not yours
---
Permanently. If you need BT, go down to Monagah Mining CO, and farm some molemen.
---
Yup, I only equip White Knight when I need to repair. I also use sneak a lot so I rarely get hit to damage my armor in the first place.
---
How many hours a day do you hang out on Reddit for work?
---
extra 500 atoms and a head pat if she's fiesty
---
Battle Royal.
---
Yeah, i just kill them all.  Same with Veterinarian Bot with the cats.
---
Aww :(
---
White Knight reduces armor repair cost. Fix it Good is to over repair the armor. It's best to use both.
---
It isn't going to harm anything if you've given up on the game ever getting better build diversity. If you want that sort of thing to be added then easy respec means it's over, meta chasing wins, no more roles in this roleplaying game.
---
It really is! 
---
Not sure why sharing my honest experiences deserves downvotes?
---
What is br mode?
---
\&gt; One character I have has max CHA. 
---
Can you make a "face" character like that work?
---
Did they have any turrets?  Point your gun at them, that will tell you who owns the CAMP.
---
I've run it often with varying results.
---
I've had runs with no legendaries.
---
I've had runs with one outside.
---
I've had runs with one inside.
---
I've had runs with one further inside past the locked doors.
---
I've had runs with multiple legendary (3+) spawns.
---
I've only seen a three star once or twice, and less than max level at that.
---
It seems to be totally random and not guaranteed.
---
So far, most of my drops from West Tek have been scrip or vendor sell previously.
---
Totally RNG.
---
I've had better luck legendary farming in White Springs just after the it goes back to normal from being nuked. There's still high level glowing bloated ones and flux to farm, and as a stealth sniper, I can put my stealth gear on and take my time (vs being in the open in a hazmat suit, contending with other players) and run circles around Whitesprings, usually getting a few legendaries per run.
---

---
I would not mind spoilers at all.
---
It's just frustrating to see in events like the new Arktos event that really require participation to actually complete the event to see people just.. standing there-  watching you desperately try to complete the event because you want the back pack that is only unlockable if you succeed in completing the event and all they care about it killing the legendary at the end which can be done regardless if the event is completed or not. that's what sucks. i don't care about you getting your loot. but if you show up to events - please help
---
No, not everyone would.  DJs in games get repetitive and annoying.  Multiply the annoying factor by 1,000 if the DJ was Rose. The best reward I received from finishing her questline was never having to listen to her nails-on-a-chalkboard voice again. I would rather be surrounded by 8 scorchbeasts screeching in my ear than have to listen to her again (as a side note, I suspect the same voice actress does Scout Leader Penny's lines, but the tone is softened and not so cringey, so I'm okay with that.)
---
Maybe... seems all SB are doing this more and more overall. 
---
A few times she looks like she’s frozen in place but still moving. 
---
A few days ago she fell into the cavern entrance area and everyone was around the rim hitting her.
---
1. A server wide alert would be useful, but we are 6 months in with 3 big events I don't think we have to worry about announcements stacking on top of each other. With only 24 people per server it would be strange if multiple large events are going off at once.
---
2. This does seem like a pretty bad issue, would the perk robot expert help out with this?
---
3. This is another issue I agree with. I recall running around looking for kelp and feeling like there was never enough 
---
4. If they improve the respawn rates I don't really mind this. It makes sense that the better you do in the first phase the better off you'll be in the following challenge. This event is also a multiplayer orientated event like the Queen and Sheepsquatch fight so it would be strange to completely rebalance it for a single player experience, this just cycles back to the need for an event notifier.
---
5. I don't think that just because an enemy has a high amount of health it's instantly a bullet sponge. It's a bullet sponge if it's only purpose is to take up time, but the event boss posses an actual threat to the event and the players. It's a big reason to keep multiple animals alive and a reason to coordinate with others players so some continue defending the animals while others grab it's aggro. If the boss didn't go after the friendlies the event losses a lot of risk and dying doesn't mean as much since you don't have to worry about defending the animals. If anything that would make it more of a bulletsponge since it's only purpose would to be shot and killed within the time limit rather than posing a threat to the animals that the event has revolved around up to this point. I haven't had an issue with it spawning on top of the friendly but if it does that's definitely something that needs to be fixed. I also think it would be nice if I could loot the legendary even if I don't tag the boss and while I usually agree that splitting objective and reward is useful for punishing players when the event fails because the got greedy, I would prefer if it wasn't used in large group events.

6. I wouldn't enjoy a whole new shop and currency for each event, we've already got several events with their own currency and little shops and I think it works best in small amounts. It would also seem strange to attach possum badges or some other existing currency to this. The big plus of having random items it for player selling. If you get an item you've already got you can sell it and if you need something you might be able to buy it from a player shop it's what I did with the sheepsquatch rewards and that worked pretty well.

The BOS outposts in Cranberry Bog all tend to spawn military ammo bags and military grade duct tape. Other than that, I buy from robot vendors.
---
Same here.  Wondering what and why.
---
Is any video game truly "worth it"? We are bags of meat and water on a rock traveling through space without our consent or control. Our time is finite. Its ending unknown. Our genes cry out for survival and duplication. The cosmos itself is a mystery we're still working out in tiny bursts in the strikingly small number of instances where a handful of us are gifted enough to be smart and privileged enough to be educated. Otherwise we are lost, confused, pointed in too many directions at once, and often lack the foresight to make good choices even when given every advantage. Any concerns we have about all of this are ultimately futile, as we will die and be forgotten anyway. Nothing a single one of us ever did will endure. Our species, our planet, our galaxy, and even our universe will one day vanish. No trace of us ever having been here will exist.
---
I really hate BR, find it too-repetitive. If only more people like us existed and maybe BR would finally die off.
---
Sadly the colors don't match too well.
---
6 just so I can share ghoulish in nuke zones but 90% of the time I play alone and equip lone wanderer and travel agent
---
Same, selling for 750, hoping someone buys it (It's upgraded)  Which I've found a Recon scope I'll be moving from my Mundane Recon Gauss to a Quad.

I hate the concept. Loading can take longer then being alive

*sweats nervously* I swear it's my...my gun *fumbles around trying to hide an erection in trousers* I'm not a duper I... I swear! *Spills an immense amount of railway spikes all over the ground in front of you, and is now scrambling to retrieve them all*
---
I might just be an idiot, but wouldn’t that mean only 9 people max could get loot, even if there’s 30 people participating?
---
Pacifist was turned off, I think because I deleted my ini files, on PC, all good now.

Battle Royale, the money making game mode that has saturated the game market in recent times.

What is the high end reward? I've done the event several times, but I doubt I'll ever have 5k candy or whatever it takes.
---
I planned out a build and I've just been going at it. I've been getting like 800 xp per quest which is pretty nice but it takes so long for some reason
---
This is bollocks
---
Lol same damn question over and over again...
---
I wear it with the Engineer's Uniform + a Welding helmet since the colors match the best and I like the tools that the engineer outfit has kind of goes with the theme - the visor of the helmet is a little weird but this is the only outfit that completely covers your character with no skin/hair showing/clipping thru with the mask. 
---
Some of the other hats like the bowler hat / top hat look alright for the old doctor look but your neck etc is exposed if you don't mind that.
---
I hope to god not,would not play it
---
Speak for yourselves. I don't consider project paradise a failure at all...
---
I'm not sure what it could be either.
---
came here to ask about this as well
---
The locked room in the top of Munitions Factory can spawn them here and there
---
Player Vending I don't mind paying 10-15 caps each I have 196 pieces in my stash
---
Luck and/or Charisma could possibly improve the chance of you getting more rare items / effect  (it is unknown at this point)
---
So it is NOT dumb to think this is possible, as it IS possible, it is "pretty dumb" to not be capable of realizing this is possible.  The game doesn't need to "read the players mind" as certain effects and items are far more rare in the loot tables (bloody / explosive etc) meaning they are more "valuable" (from a rarity perspective).  
---
It seems there are at least a couple ways to find out :
---
1. Experiment: buy a significant amount of items with Low CHR / LUCK and track the results 
---
2. Data mining: is there anything in the code indicating if players CHR / LUCK alter the item obtained
---
3. Answer from Bethesda:  If we ask, they may tell us

At the very least build it from the wood and steal on their corpses.

Probably adding new stuff to the atom store. Like new outfits for the floor ghouls or hats for the invisible super mutants.  
---
You know, the usual.  
---
Seriously though, I've got a ten minute break to sign in with my ALTs and buy up today's round of the anti-radiation nuka (orange?) so my lv 13 can carry on running his mutations and it's a bloody update! (Yeah, they're making the game better, I hate that....)
---
TECHNO
---
The fact that you refer to these circumstances as problems in of themselves has nothing to do with the material provided. I perform as I am "incentivized" to perform given the tools and frameworks provided. That's how positive feedback loops work. Just like you came here with a moral argument hoping to get upvotes from those similarly outraged with the situation as it stands. To put it bluntly, if the accelerator of a car were on the other side of the brake pedal, I would adjust my engagement with the car appropriately in order to continue moving forward. The amount by which I approach or exceed the speed limit is directly affected by how much I am incentivized to do either at any given time and the risks involved.

What is the best way to get bos heavy combat?
---
It’s starts immediately but everyone on the map gets a notification that it has started. So you kind of have to hope people will want to show up.
---
You quickly realize you have no idea how to read coordinates. You stare at the radio hoping that it'll just tell you where to go 🤔
---
Thank you for that! I had forgotten about the reduced repair cost with white knight and only considered that it slow degradation. I have only been using fix it good at the repair bench. D'oh....
---
Same here
---
They can sure as hell grab the ingredients to put in the troughs, and distract the boss for me. I don't even see level 300s picking up the shit. It's always only me running around while 5 dudes are buttfucking at habitat A
---
Game crashed and I was greeted with the download. Have been on for several hours. It's that 11:00 EDT refresh?!?
---
One shotting anything at a group event shouldn't be possible.

The game needs to be rebalanced so this isn't possible.

Excellent point, I had not thought of that.
---
And thank you sir ....
---
Pretty easy to no put ammo on there then. I havent seen this or noticed it but I haven't been selling ammo on the vendor or paying that much attention to it really. That sounds like a huge loss.
---
Rando garbage 3 star

Same here. Played a couple of hours ago. Nothing on the offical forums as far as I can see. ???

Damn that sucks.

This is a brilliant idea.
---
&gt; Download sizes for today’s patch will be approximately 5.5 GB for consoles and under 9 GB\* for PC. 
---
From Patch notes.
---
Do you have the twisted muscles mutation gun accuracy is decreased by 50% are you using perk cards to increase damage output?
---
Yeah. It rewards both the grinding and also gives a chance at hitting the lottery. Gives both casual and non-casual players a way to work towards goals.
---
I find it's only really useful in a Whitesprings nuke zone where glowies are nonstop. Everything else is too hit-and-miss to justify the points.
---
the OP said when someone comes and one shots stuff right? if everyone is there helping in an event and is doing the event YET the boss gets one shot preventing others from getting anything, that's gross.
---
if someone comes to an event and doesn't help at all and only attacks a boss for loot please just don't. it hurts everyone trying to do the event AND the people there to do the event miss out on loot and can fail the event also.
---
Go to Watoga. There’s 2-3 power armor spawns in close proximity to each other. 1 in the center of town next to the crashed vertibird, 1 on the roof of the building to the right of the civic center, and one on the roof of the medical center. Makes for a quick circuit to run and maximizes your odds of finding what you want per server hop.
---
Lab coat in a boat in the junkyard east of the vault
---
Ah that explains it thank you for clearing that up :)
---
Might have wondered dow. From savage divide.
---
Lighting fix, I appreciate this.
---
The best way to get xp:
---
Go to aaronholt farm and pick the cranberries. Make juice for +2%xp. Run Feed the People for the meat stew that gives you +5%. Make sure you're well rested for another +5%. Last, hop onto survival fo you get a 20% buff on top of all that.
---
At your level, the cost of dying is minimal. Just build a small, easily portable camp and plop it down in whatever area you'll be in for a while. Clear out a building? Stop and drop all your junk and most of your aid. Take a workshop? Immediately build a stash box and drop your shit. Someone kill you? Oh well, you lose 10 caps and should have a convenient respawn point in the area.
---
I did this on a new character a couple weeks ago and took her from level 1-50 in less than 20 hours.
---
It should find existing install and just role on into login.
---
There really should be a "put all in your stash" option to reset to a clean slate...
---
Works with SB sonic attacks, too.   Dense chests and fireproof are mandatory.
---
This. Extinguishers are everywhere.
---
Even more interesting (just came up with this idea)
---
Vault 94 has "memory configuration technology" and is a dungeon. You have to fight your way through and at the end you eject the "MCT" holotape, which can be loaded into your personal terminal. All you have to do in order to respec, is open your terminal.
---
I've also heard something about "paragon perks." I hope this is something like, once you hit level 50 and have maxed out a card's star level, you can "upgrade" it. Now the card gives you full effect of the card, but only costs one SPECIAL point
---
Appears they're just correcting a lighting file in the game which wasn't intended.
---
Does Blocker require you to actually block or is this just a all the time damage reduction from incoming Melee attacks?
---
It is still possible with a 25% chance to never get a badge after 100 events, improbable but possible. It still gives a good reason to grind those 2 and also if we want we can focus the badges for a nice set pool of items with specific costs.
---
At least the note of the Vault 51 dweller points in that direction and also some spoilers of translation bugs lately.
---
I guess they had a arena combat experiment going on in vault 51- everything controlled by ZAX.
---
And i can imagine we, the vault 76 dwellers come in handy to continue the experiment, since all other 51 dwellers are dead and the former BR survivor of 51 escaped at first and die while try to shut ZAX down.
---
oh, for the love of Atom....
---
The whole damn point of survival was supposed to be "more risk, more rewards".  They keep decreasing the risk of playing Survival, but the rewards structure remains the same.  You get more experience, a 3* weekly legendary for completing challenges that are 1000 times easier than what we have to complete for a measly 10 atoms, you lose less caps for losing a PvP encounter in Survival than what you do for losing the same encounter in Adventure.  And people are still asking for it to be made even easier.
---
Downvote me to hell and back if you want. I don't care.  I was okay with all the extra perks for Survival players when players were actually taking a risk by playing it. , but this is getting ridiculous.
---
Thats huge for a lighting issue
---
I think someone is over exaggerating:)
---
I play on a team more than half the time in general and almost always for events, so this becomes much less important.
---
There are many sides to this issue, but the one many overlook the most is failing an event when others don't do their part, Fashnact was a perfect example, a single Suicider that was allowed to get to the robots could end the event for everyone, so I would concentrate my efforts on only those and was frequently frowned upon for one shotting them before anyone else got a shot, but also saw the event fail on several occasions where low level players were unable to stop them before they got to the Marchers.
---
The new event has the same issues, if enemies are not quickly dispatched, the Event will certainly Fail.
---
Scorched Earth has it's own set of issues, as a Ranged player I try to concentrate my efforts on the SBQ, but often find I have to stop to deal with the mobs biting me in the Butt, or shooting me in the back while several Melee players stand around staring at the sky, who then get mad when I turn around &amp; mow down the Mob before they get a shot, not realizing that they already had ample opportunity to get their shot, but didn't take it.
---
I try to be courteous, and a Team player, but it's a Two Way street and  everyone has their limits.
---
Everyone confused had already downloaded yesterdays patch and played on it. The answer was added, lighting fix for PC file.
---
No problem
---
Nice! It's fun how the different friendlies act like regular AI, and sometimes very stupid ;-)
---
I had one run up on two dead Legendaries. He didn't make it...
---
I noticed that I was able to do something similar on XBox but with the Frogs you can now collect.. I find that I can click A to collect them rapidly and I will pick up multiple frogs from a single frog? I found a set of three frogs and ended up with 8 instead of 3.
---
I sell cheap ammo to get rid of it. Considering i got the ammo for free anyways
---
I miss Skeeter Davis - End of the world from FO4...
---
Totally agree.
---
Bloodied is more than good enough.   Realistically whomever gets the initiative in the fight has a clear advantage.    There is no tanking in PVP—from what I have heard from those that do PVP.
---
4 = lone vanderer
---
Could be 5 percent or anyway they set it, anything that makes people want to contribute instead of tagging and hiding.
---
It was a good place like wataoga before they changed the spawn rates when they introduced Survival mode.
---
Now it rarely spawns legendaries like Harper's town. My camp has been in that location since December and it used to be one of my favorite hunting grounds. (Anymore I just go if I need mutifruit or tatos).
---
First time I'd noticed it myself. I will no longer put more than 1 piece of each available type of ammo in my vendor. I added signage that reads "ask 4 ammo deals 2:1" on the front of my vendor... In addition to "dm offers trades"
---
I'd rather collect 1000 caps on a 2000 round sale than 48,and I'm sure people would rather pay 1k than 2k.
---
Who is pushing a cartel?
---
The event takes like 30 seconds to start so people have time to get there once notification goes out
---
The silos net a bunch of ballistic fiber, both ammo bags and military grade duct tape.  I think I get 6 to nine from each silo.  Even if not launching a nuke running the silo to the storage room is profitable in junk to scrap.
---
Ahh, that's disappointing. If it was at least a unique named weapon (not even OP) I'd consider grinding the candy, but I can't get trash legendaries anywhere.
---
To be fair, a lot of the code that powers dragons also powers scorchbeasts. I similar to how TES's magic is repurposed for guns, and enchantments are repurposed for legendary effects. The engine already has a lot of that code in there, so just bring it to the new game, make adjustments, and give it a more lore-friendly name.
---
Sometimes a post on here, giving people a heads up your going to do it, will get you some backup. Just be sure to list platform and psn/gt.
---
The power plant? That's weird. Maybe it was a revenge nuke to hit someone's camp?
---
If you have a tick or bloat fly forget about protecting it lol
---
I always get 7-8gb updates. Anyone know why? I don't want this taking up all that room on my hard drive.
---
I'm fairly sure the puncturing mod for the power fist can only be learned by scrapping. I've never seen it for sale anywhere as a plan or individual mod. The good news is it seems fairly easy to learn. I think I only had to scrap around five to get it.
---
While you're working on that the heating coil is a good alternative and readily available at a ton of vendors.
---
Yeah I think that's just what most people want is a stash box near by  and a workbench to scrap any junk real quick before they move on. I know I've walked to people's camps because they were close to where I was out in BFE only to find that they only had the vendors outside but nothing else x.x Thank you tho to people who put their workbenches by windows the fools lol
---
I tell you what. If you're on PS4, I could use a traveling buddy.
---
It should only be 8.5 gb per the bethesda page
---
*shoots random corpse on the ground with flechette harpoon gun*
---
*loots 37 harpoons from corpse*
---
*adds them to growing mountain of harpoons in c.a.m.p.*
---
Maybe I should write a paper on the lifecycle anf reproductive habits of the Appalachian Harpoon...
---
7.73 GB
---
This. But for sure a event/questline like sheepsquatsh or pioneer scouts.
---
Good Idea its on Xbox NeedyVessel3316 im gonna wait for a couple min before starting
---
Can confirm no - I tried as well x.x
---
I want more character and better build diversity in the next Fallout. It IS over for Fallout 76. I'm trying to embrace what 76 is, even if it's not exactly what I want.

As a melee build, was not impressed by the LMG a bunch of levels ago.  The sniper hit harder, and was faster to kill. Scrapped every one I found. 
---
But that was before I started intentionally taking potshots at SBs.
---
Looted an AA LMG.   Quite respectable performance against SB65 and 80’s.
---
Vampire sniper is also good.  Mine puts out 110, plus the health regen...
---
Faster fire rate is far superior . I only use explosive on harder hitting slower weapons
---
shows as 7.73 for me
---
Agree. Maybe some kind of proximity error?
---
Thanks! Haven’t ran the watoga circuit yet so I’ll give it a go!
---
Yeah it says 8.5gb in the link, so I figured generalization in the title would be OK.
---
You can also shoot corpses to loot harpoons. 
---
I should write a paper on the lifecycle and reproductive habits of the Appalachian harpoon.
---
Who the fuck downvoted this?
---
I only use first in combat situations pve or pvp - I only use third when I'm just hanging out and not really doing anything like PVP or SBQ or something.
---
Shows the same for me, until I try to download it, then having 12gb free isn't enough and it wants the full 61gb.
---
I had a two story house i was trying to consolidate, but I couldn't place walls and roofs on certain areas. Finally I got ticked off and scrapped the whole second floor. ALMOST all. One wall and roof section it refused to let me get rid of.  It said that part of the structure would be inaccessible?!  When I logged in the next day though, it let me take them out.
---
TLDR: If it's being really illogical, logging out and back in MIGHT help?
---
Thanks for the Info!
---
I've only got 12gb free, so it wants to download 61gb instead.
---
Is it? I don't know enough about game development to know how big the lighting files are
---
Awesome to see you guys here.. :)
---
You guys are really getting there. Would not be people complaining about this and that if you were not giving us something we care about! :)
---
My worry is, with every single new update and new content added, the loading times will get longer and longer. I hope it will get optimised in some way. Server-hopping is becoming less attractive now that you have to wait several minutes after spawning for everything around you to appear.
---
Sounds awesome! Where can you find that surv outfit?
---
I’m not, I’m sorry. I’m XB1, but I’m starting to believe that all the nicest people are on PS4 ;)
---
Possibly. When someone nuked arka pharma the other day it caused high level ghouls and scorch to spawn in the area and wonder out of it.
---
Yeah takes 4 seconds to down a lvl 80 when its in range...very op lol
---
I've only got 12gb free, so it wants to download 61gb instead of 7gb.
---
Just normal from Bethesda. They messed up again with version control.
---
Do you know if either the rifle or pipe bolt-action, can be modded  to have fast reload and fast fire rate
---
And especially since some of the plan names for camp items do not correspond with what they are called in the camp building menu!
---
You're awesome - I'll drop you an invite when I get home from work :)
---
Yes, it's getting SO much better. Granted there are issues here and there. But you should stick with it.
---
Keep in mind a lot of people will travel to base first to empty their junk items then travel to the event.
---
Allow a little extra time than 30 seconds.
---
Same ! Last update (few days ago) and today....Why do I have to download 61GB patches for 2 times.....
---
I thought it was 8 GB update :(
---
Level 50+ Workshop holders wearing Excavator Power Armor in Adventure Mode yield the most ballistic fiber per bullet.
---
Yeah there's a discrepancy between what items are called as plans vs in the build menu x.x
---
*Equips Super Sledge*  Got your stick?  HOLDIN' IT!
---
I literally turned off the soundtrack to this game after I got bored, fired up Fallout 3 Radio on youtube and it made the game feel so damn right. The Nostalgia of THREE DAWGGGGGG coming at you live!!! GALAXY NEWS NETWORK I MISS YOU.

\~ Sincerely a time traveling member of Vault 101
---
I haven't seen that one yet!!!
---
After 8 months from release we are soon able to change our character name. This is a huge step for Fallout 76! Game has progressed so much from the BETA!
---
If your PC, I'd love to have you join my group too.

"FarPlace"
---
You...you monster how could you that is jus-actually his clothes can give some good stats so good trade I guess
---
That wasn't there 25 minutes ago
---
&gt;Put more in the feeder, better friendly comes out and makes them much easier to defend.
---
How do you know this?
---
It can spawn in a lot of places. I get it a lot by the army camp up north where you can do a tour of the camo.....close to the antiques shop.
---
Sounds to me like you're downloading he whole game again honestly.
---
I run lone wanderer and tenderizer. You can also throw on the Booze one that gives luck also
---
Wtf are you talking about
---
yes 
---
and I finally got the legendary scrapper to appear 
---
had to use the camp terminal  and  then wait inside the white spring train station for a few minutes till the vendor bot spawned
---
The largely repetitive or purely functional radio now available is tedious.
---
It spawned at the bridge outside of flatwoods right by overseer camp.

You fallas going to be playing this weekend? I am on PC and haven't played past level 14. I keep going back to modded FO4. I want to explore and see what the game has to offer but I have always been off put since the release issues and horrible performance.
---
Not sure if there's less or more toxicity in our community but i'm happy you had a wholesome experience!
---
I still see them at the Harper's Ferry location, but I think if you pick up any plan there, then you can't spawn any more plans there for 24 hours.  So, make sure whichever plan you pick up there happens to be the one you want.
---
What other alien is there then?
---
Certainly not! You’ve been very well mannered. :)
---
 I bought a bloodied crossbow and well worth the caps just wish it had mods.
---
Gotta be really fast
---
I said fully charged though??
---
Try letting it continue and it should find the original game install and just roll on past, this doesn't sound related to our new current patch as the OP was describing and I'm currently downloading.
---
But this has happened to me on my PC a few times and if I let it try to install the whole game it find it's already there and just goes to login.
---
Maybe close Bethesda Launcher *Exit it* and start the game from the Fallout76 exe, go into game then exit as usual and try starting Bethesda Launcher again.
---
I don't know, they haven't released any updates that introduce significant new advancement options yet, so I wouldn't rule it out that they are working on some better systems.
---
50 ghouls. I only use 2 handed weapons and the satisfaction I would get from standing in the pile of bodies with my bloody weapon after I just mindlessly beat the shit out of each one is just too real.
---
this saves 20 seconds.
---
Can't wait for all the old bugs and dupe exploits again :)
---
Not for Fallout 76, I guarantee. Hopefully the next Fallout shows improvement.
---
Hopefully it's tested and ready to go. Good work!
---
Oh with a higher charisma? I only got a 3 so I get 2 lol
---
Ok thanks I do have an instigating in my box. Ill try that one out instead!!
---
I second that idea
---
I think Bethesda missed an opportunity with having robot npcs by not having some kind of text to speach to have very dynamic and reactive conversations about players actions in the game.
---
Them being robots gives leeway with the weirdness of voice synthesis.
---
Producing new recorded speach for a game is a huge bottleneck content creation wise, not to mention cost. TTS is the sky's the limit comparativly.
---
It’s really good idea, completely optional as well just like Destiny
---
man its almost as if were two different people and have the right to say whatever we want.
---
It’s atom shop as well.
---
Thanks man. I know statistics. I used a bit of hyperbole because reddit doesn't pay me to calculate p-values. Let me rephrase. 
---
Based upon my sample and further data points provided by colleagues, it is highly improbable that the true probability is 25%. Our sample puts the observed estimated mean at 10%.
---
Agree. It is not PvP now. It is a game that is only killed by explosive weapons in 0.2 seconds when it enters the top 3.
---
You seem like a person who really knows how to enjoy things.
---
Dear god radio that is triggered by world actions and plays an appropriate texts when something happens is between the most awesome game design ideas I seen so far

If you're in cranberry bog you can always repair the SAM sites if you're close. I've literally cleared the entire sky doing that

Full charge gives the listed damage of the gun anything under fully charged shot is less than the listed damage output.

Oooh, that would make sense for enemies to go after players nearby rather than just despawning.

Just search "worth playing" in this sub and read the answers to the other dozen or do posts asking this she question. Save time.

The Halloween candy was a nice idea, but the candy weighed too much and the rewards were too small. There are lessons there for any future token-based systems.
---
Sorry I wasn’t very clear, steel farming refers to going to a specific area and scrapping everything you find. You then bulk everything you don’t need and sell it to a vendor. An easy spot for this is the lumber mill in the top northwest corner of the map (can’t remember the name off hand, I’ll update this in a bit with it).
---
It’s full of low level supermutants and tonnes of junk to scrap. It also has several workbenches so you can scrap as you go. Running this will give you a good couple of hundred steel. Especially if you use the scrapper perk someone else mentioned earlier.
---
Hope this helps you out a bit.

That’s not what was meant though. There was the narrative that scorchbeasts were literal retextures of dragons drag and dropped from Skyrim.
---
I think it’s just random from 2-3 maybe 4
---
Very nice. Lighting does remind me a bit of a nightclub, though.
---
Should I stack 4 and deliver or deliver one at a time?  Does the higher number increase the chances?
---
Thanks, I’m going to build a plasma Gatling and up some of my ammo. I think I need more preparation before I try again.
---
Laser is green bolt, ultracite laser is red bolt, plasma is green beam. I can't guarantee all of them have it, but there is a beam splitter add at least for lase rifles that splits the shots.
---
I've primed a gauss rifle and shotgun. Shotgun isn't really worth it, imo. Too much of a hassle to craft the ammo and the damage increase isn't really noticeable. The gauss is pretty good though. I usually switch between add control with the gauss and freezing the queen with a cryolator during SBQ fights and the gauss handles most enemies with ease.
---
Glad to hear it!  I'll be off and on today.  Suggest find me when you get a chance!
---
My lvl 26 fiend killed me when I was 110 with a headshot. The game pvp is terrible
---
Mine is downloading too. No idea WTF.
---
That would get memed into oblivion
---
You love to use real life traffic/vehicles as example so I have a suggestion, which could make game much better for you. Bethesda could add dps warning signs to every area. These signs would tell how much dps is allowed in the area. I know this won't be enough so we would also need some police officers to follow how much dps you really do. If you do too much dps in some low dps areas you would get a penalty. Maybe few day ban from the game or your weapons are taken away. Would you like this kind of solution? After all players are dicks and Bethesda has nothing to do with these easy to kill enemies, or what?
---
fuck
---
If this is about the ground lighting up different colors (pink, white, green, orange) then console players are affected by this. Tired of running through the mire and the ground looks like it’s covered by fluorescent snow
---
Don’t worry too much!
---
"Hic, it looks like the Grapton, uh, Gafton, Graf-Tun workshop has been tooken over.  Hope who ever took it is doing swell!"
---
You quickly realize they must be trapped by mutants in the portalet behind you base. How else would they be able to throw a radio through your window!
---
I feel like this might not necessarily true - I enjoy the game alot (800+ hours in right now yikes) and I have no plans on quitting now despite all the crashes and bugs. But I still think there are a lot of things that could be improved upon and a forum where the community managers can actively be seen sending up our suggestions and asking for feed back seems like a good place to voice concerns. We know they're listening because they've made positive changes that everyone's asked for like (Known) on plans you've already learned etc. I know this is something that my friend who probably doesn't even know what reddit is but was concerned about wanted very badly and they did stop playing for a while. So I am glad that there were people here asking / requesting / complaining to make the experience better. I don't really believe that everything that people complain about here are going to be fixed or addressed in any way as I think a lot of things aren't in line with what the devs are planning to do with this game but some things could be changed for the better. 
---
But I do agree with you that it would be nice to put polls directly on the home screen or in the news section so we can also get feedback from people who don't use any type of forums or social media to go with their gameplay to get a bigger and better idea of what the player base wants as I believe places like reddit don't represent everyone in the game.
---
That was kind of my first thought too. I did not see any chance in the area and I checked the map right away so I'm not sure.
---
I have yet to see the plan to add a extra claw yet, so I always pick up any I see
---
8GB for "an incorrect lighting file" seems pretty fishy.
---
Is that switch to power off the rad shower? If not id recommend keeping it off, its really annoying to go to someones shop and get all your rads removed before you can spawn in lol
---
Good advice. I managed to hold Posideon for HOURS last night till I logged off with no issues, but I left the extractors (FC and lead) open and only came back to defend and retake from AI enemies.  If anyone did grab any cores, it didn't hurt me any.
---
I saw it one time when I was like level 10 and it disappeared. I'm level 85 now and it appeared again and started attacking me randomly while I was about to enter site Alpha.  
---
Not even sure but something like 200hours of game play between sightings. Who knows maybe someone off in the distance snapped a picture of us.
---
cool. i just want adventure mode.
---
Someone who is ashamed of their attraction to Bill Nye, obviously.
---
yeah its turns it on and off. you dont spawn anywhere near it and the shop is outside. that is the inside where my "house" is
---
Just finished my update this morning. This this post made me all excited again.
---
I prefer combat rifle than handmade, math is worse, but I get the impression that this gun is more willing to listen to me.
---
But you *can* make a new character...
---
Fortunately I didn't forget this! Was already in the practice with the PA to use the slower degrade and fix it good when It needed repairing, which was very infrequently
---
Try figuring out the difference between the plan: locker and the other plan: locker. Was a pain in the ass before the (Known) update. Bought the locker plan 10times to only keep getting the same one and not the one I wanted
---
Tried that, shutdown the machine, restarted, the lot.  
---
Still says it's a 7gb download (if it didn't detect the game files it would say it was a 61gb download off from the start), then complains that 12gb isn't enough free space and says it now wants to download the full 61gb.
---
The extra claw plan can drop from deathclaws. But you must have learned the deathclaw plan first.
---
There once was a guy named Lou
---
Who encountered a sudden error or two
---
He clicked on "new text post"
---
But his effort was toast
---
All he had to do was sort by New
---
Oh. I know higher charisma you get greater event rewards.
---
I can confirm the friendly animals will attack players and also defend themselves - sincerely the bloody build who got destroyed by the deathclaw she was defending

They said they had the wrong lighting file in the last patch so they’re correcting it today.
---
I used to do the same thing till a group kited the legendary away from me but left me to kill all the mobs.
---
Now I just hit everything once with anything that is instigating with attack power increase can pretty much kill anything in one hit at lower levels.
---
Thank you so Much you answer is exactly what im looking for

Richie Maaarcus...
---
Well here in England......everything is just boring so I had to brighten up a dreary existence somehow haha. Thanks for checking out the video.
---
Exactly ...i have played soon 1200h to get an awesome build, now i should kill enemies slower ? No thanks . People need to start changing QOL perks for dmg perks !! And no i dont use explosive weapons ( they suck imo )
---
I'm lost are you upset with the dupers or the price of shotgun shells? I do agree the dupers have destroyed the economy and the 10% tax is just a cap sink.
---
“Dick Shale here, the official voice of Blamco Mac &amp; Cheese, that’s if the check goes through...”
---
Yes, but only if i have just killed one or more, has been liek this from the start i think.
---
Yesterday i killed a SB in Watoga, fast travel back to camp (twin lakes) and the SB falls through my roof, so i had a nice SB head in the middle of my Camp living room :)
---
made my day
---
My character was originally Carl Brutananadilewski, from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. But I changed him when they borked the nukagirl costume. And, no one ever got the reference. 
---
It was kinda fun being a bare-midriffed fat guy in a nukagirl outfit, especially when they fixed the helmet so my stach showed.
---
The issue I've had is the body in Arktos disappeared - I did a decent chunk to the alpha but I'm bloody so they looked at me and died and when I ran back there was no body x.x
---
4 for me.  
---
3 Hard Bargain and 1 Travel Agent while you are getting caps and lvl.
---
Other wise, the lone wanderer.
---
Yeah, sometimes I hit inspect on the plan because I for some reason think I'm going to see what it looks like, but of course it's just a slightly larger picture of the plan 😂
---
I still do this and idk why.
---
Generally a good community experience, but in the last 2 weeks I seem to run into greifey teabagging asshats everytime I take a workshop. Starting to think I ruffled someone's feathers somewhere somehow. Also, I play on XB1... 
---
Game seems pretty improved from launch for sure though
---
Someone bought like 50-60 ammo on the second sale which would explain the 48 caps.
---
Well said.
---
Yeah rifleman now works for standard and prime receiver and commando works for full Auto. 
---
I got lucky and have one with 25% less VATS cost on my auto one so I basically live in VATS when I use it. It’s impossible to control otherwise lol
---
Someone nuked the forest area right to the west of Morgantown, never seen that one before. 
---
I mean I got some nice materials out of it, but it was an odd place to see it go off.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I mean that may be the case with these too I’m saying idk
---
The 50 ghouls.  The RNG setup in this game lends to players getting more benefit from larger groups of enemies than a single bullet sponge.
---
I’m so sick and tired of seeing these two words being used over and over and over again as “proof” that the game is in a good design state right now.
---
The irony is unbelievable. The lack of self awareness is hilarious.
---
I use prime receivers on a few chars. Flux is pretty easy to come by so it's no more of a grind than make normal ammo. I think some weapons benefit more than others. On my heavy weapons I put a prime on my LMG as you make way more ultracite .308 than normal. It's worth having at least one prime weapon for Scorched Earth.
---
I do have a comfort little camp ! But I think the reason why there were so many ppl was because my Teddy Bear giveaway yesterday. Was helping them to complete the daily challenge. :D
---
Also getting nothing from legendaries is still in the loot pool. Killed two sheepsquachs last night, got nothing. Killed a 3* blood bug, got nothing.
---
Thank you so much for this info - I've been living the hobo life for weeks omg
---
Still doing it? I can come lend a hand
---
Man that totally subtle subliminal messaging must really work.
---
Nice work
---
Yes, I got hit about 3 times total this week, but I play a lot!
---
I think because I'm level 200, others hitting me just want bragging rights. It can't be for the junk because I don't scrap hardly at all. This keeps most items out of the "junk" that can be lost. However it does keep me heavy all the time. My junk is just the same crap that all others can pick up if they were not PVP'ing.
---
About 90% of the time it does end with them lying on the ground and I get xx of their caps.  That's when I just bail out feeling "better" about the ending.
---
It's still a net loss of a few caps because they may have hit me a few times more. This is not my "thing".   I might get my junk back, I might not.. but that's why it called Junk.
---
Hahaha exactly
---
Oh I didn't know that. Thank you
---
Can't do instances without characters being restricted to a server where they were created. You would be losing the ability to server hop, though yes, the 24 player restriction would definitely have to be lifted. The game as a whole would have to be overhauled to accommodate that level of a design change this late into the game. I don't see it happening.
---
Oh, that sounds more complicated, in this case and unless you are able to nuke other space hogs on the OS drive your options are limited. The drive  has 12gb free but include the needed overhead that the operating system requires to function and if you have a 'mature' install on the Laptop with not much contiguous space you will need to do a more major OS cleanup.
---
The Bethesda Launcher will require the 7-9 GB for installing the patch + space for the download and working temp space.
---
In today's modern gaming I don't even bother unless I have at least a spare unused 100 gb on the main OS drive.
---
So, if you don't have Picklock 1, the Cop with the card is inaccessible to you ? Is there an alternative way into the room ?

I used to run around with a max melee build and even with a pool stick id one shot the ghouls. I've since converted to heavy Gunner and ran around with a Mr handy Buzzsaw but I'd always tag the other melee players by accident, even on Pacifist mode, and of course they'd kill me for it. So now I just toss grenades or fire off my Mk19 in a crowd and wait. The dmg for PvP tag is more aggravating than losing out on that sweet 1* wood leg or 3* rolling pin. But I think the single grenade is better.
---
Plague walker will still hurt it either way.
---
If you think that only one person is responsible for this mistake, or for packaging releases, you're mistaken.
---
Unfortunately,I'm on PC
---
Yea the closes spawn point to it was someone's camp just outside of that little down were the parade event took place. By the time the game loaded in there were several destroyed walls and some like level 40 scorch attacking. Me and the other that started to fast travel there to get to nuke zone wiped them out. Bet the owner was surprised at the damage done to his camp.
---
Explosive adds a significant amount of damage. Your post literally absurd.

What I don't speech machine
---
The fuck are you talking about, mate. That's quite good for a non-bloodied version. With just perk cards (not including nerd rage or adrenaline) it maxes it at 77. If you use adrenal reaction and nerd rage you can get it to the 130s. Obviously more with full adrenaline.
---
Ditto.. I about feel this is the core of the game. We are all trying to survive.
---
Some that have become my regulars that now join me often are all sporting some awesome weapons, mutations, PA, and other killer stuff. the game is JUST so much better in a crew.
---
Did you build on top of a red rocket? I want to build on top of a red rocket!
---
This is a double edged sword. This mechanic causes some issues, like mobs spawning at camps when people fast travel in but sometimes it is the only way to get more mobs to show up at all. 
---
I think the world would be way more empty without it but I agree some tweaks at least need to happen.
---
It would but then I can see some one accidentally scrapping a item they wanted to keep. So I don't mind the two step process.
---
The nerf was way too severe.  I'm still miffed.
---
This is the only song I remember from Fallout 4.
---
Lmao not gonna lie, about 25% of my stash weight consists of chems. About the same amount of stimpaks, and double the radaway. One of these days Ill do the tadpole challenge so I can just carry them all on me with Traveling Pharmacy.
---
My run changes often based on what sells in my vending machines. I always hop to Black Mtn Ordinance Works first to get the three available plans there that reset every 20hrs. (X-01 Nuka Cola quantum paint plan, T-51 Nuka Cola paint plan, and alien blaster mod plan). Those sell pretty quickly for good prices. Next I server hop grafton station to get multiple of each of the BoS combat armor plans, like 6-10 of each. Those sell like fucking hot cakes right now for a way marked up price. Like 500 for arms and legs, and 750-1000 for the chest. Next, I’ll server hop the enclave bunker to get multiple of the x-01 military paint plans. These also sell for a ridiculous mark-up, and quickly too! Then I’ll do Free Range a few times for some duplicate staff, club, or crook plans. They sell pretty good depending on what mod you’re selling. Since I have all the mods learned (2 fucking weeks of farming!) I’ll craft a bunch of the staffs with various mods. I can sell burning barbed staffs for 500-1000 caps no problem. They’re just heavy and take up a lot of stash space. With just these sales, I easily make over 5k each and every day with minimal effort, not including the easy 1400 I get from the vendors for selling marine tactical helmets which are super easy to craft and sell for 30c each.
---
Gotta nuke something.
---
Unless it is an open field them ghouls love to sneak in ranged rad attacks. And rad worms.
---
Is this an idea or something that's in game?
---
This is the last thing I would care about, considering they would most likely break something involved with shops and sorting in general
---
my heavy gunner would prefer the bullet sponge. 1 shot. its dead.
---
Absolutely. Happened to me. The items are easy to spot, but sometimes it takes a few seconds for the diamond to appear. Just stand there for a second and it will light up.
---
Problem in paradise is when I went down / respawned immediately - the Alpha body disappeared and I was unable to loot despite doing a large amount of damage to it :c so rez are appreciated in the name of everyone getting loot 
---
i feel your pain tho. it also sucks when you're the only one actually defending the squishy animals and no one helps you out so the animal dies because all they care about is the legendary
---
&gt; Seriously replace this person cause they are shit at their job.

​
---
I hope your boss doesn't treat you the same way as this. People make mistakes and unless the mistake causes irreparable harm it's all good with an apology.
---
I never said it was a well designed game and doesn't need balance addressed I was just trying to state I'm sick of people asking Beth to make things easier when I think most players find none of it that hard once you learn it
---
No you can get the park ranger outfit and hat. That’s what you deserve. Bethesda doesn’t want you to feel cool especially with armor/outfits that they didn’t design. In their own opinion New Vegas barely happened. It gets referenced once in FO4 by decon and that’s just as a quick joke.
---
Or just another radio station in general giving out PSA or something would be cool.
---
Or even have the current radio station have interruptions to announce a event starting l. Like a emergency broadcast system.
---
They have played around with the potential of the radio but they have yet to really utilize it yet.
---
you can sell them for 1 cap to the bots, they're free caps
---
Does all that red no hurt your eyes?
---
Maybe both instances were just for the Flux of it.
---
Worse since the legendaries for campfire tales drop like level 20. Well done Mr lvl 200, these were clearly meant for you and only you.
---
I didnt really consider this. I dont bother with most the daily challenges though. Too much work for a few atoms.
---
What about Grafton Monsters? I wonder now because of the levell 100 Alpha one that can spawn during the new Project Paradise event.
---
If you had to pick one set of Sentinel armor, what would you pick? A mix? All Unyielding? I'm trying to get a set for each enemy type.
---
I think they are transitioning to multiplayer content too slowly. They have so much push back from the "solo player 4 lyfe" folks that they get a ton of backlash for something as simple as "revive a team mate in water."
---
Now that they have some events which require coordination, they need to I close instanced areas with minimum player numbers and minimum level requirements for a true multiplayer concept. Some instances can require team of 4. Some can require 2 teams of 4. They can even redesign groups to max out at 8 or 10. They can add group finders for pugs but also there will the be the elite class of dungeon raiders who stay coordinated (note this class doesn't have any issues with successfully completing any of the small time multiplayer events).
---
That... thing... reminds me too much [The Enigma of Amigara Fault](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZNSaq)
---
Not good...
---
Bethesda just changing their cloud service to cheaper and slower solution. More profit.
---
No. What I’m saying is that for rifles weight should he toned down substantially from what it is. In what world does a Hunting Rifle with a polycarbonate stock weigh 15 pounds? It doesn’t make sense that a Hunting Rifle with a full wood stock weighs less. Wood is substantially heavier than polycarbonate. All I’m asking for is sensible weapon weight or at least weight reduction perks. My AK should not weigh as much as a Gatling Plasma.

No i just steal it from open water purifiers.

This better be some ray tracing level lighting or I’ll be mildly upset.
---
Bethesda failed again with version control. Funny to see how many old bugs and glitches will be back.
---
I mean they could have just dragged the date with the real life date and I would be happy. Even if I played through four in game days and it still says May 23rd 2103 I would be pleased.

Bah, oops.  I watched that fan-made video last night and the guy was wearing a 111 jumpsuit, must've stuck in my brain-mind.  I promise, I'm from 76 like everybody else.  Really.  😐

---
My opinion will be unpopular let the down votes begin. Bethesda needs to fix the duping glitches assign serial numbers to God Roll weapons or whatever they have to do. After they stop the duping remove all TSE weapons make a gun buy back program. Then put serialized TSE weapons back into the game from Legendary Drops if the weapon serial number is duplicated remove all guns with that serial number. Now we can have TSE be bad ass again instead of being neutered.

You should try getting a remote for your television, it really changes everything....

I use alchohol buffs for strength so I have quack surgeon, and all the other alchohol perks. Mysterious Savior is a good idea. Still tweaking my character a bit. Friendly Fire isnt nearly as effective as I hoped so Ill probably drop that
---
There is a sub basement behind a keypad door. If you go down there during the food phase, you can find a terminal with a shutdown code. Take that to the AI computer to shut it down. The experiment then gets taken over by the friendly robot. He uses a different formula which allows the friendly monsters to fight back and defend themselves and heals them in between the waves. Makes it a fair bit easier to keep them alive. Door code 970930.

Don’t forget those same free loaders are going through your pockets and stealing your gear when you die.

---
You may be completely right. 
---
But where you go completely wrong is your total lack of social skills and emotional control, because you come off like a total asshole. If you changed your approach, people would listen to you more.
---
As it is now, the only thing you’re going to do is draw the support of other people with the same tantrum issues, instead of affecting change on those who need it, making the game better for you and everyone else.
---
I agree. I just wasn't sure if Poseidon provided opportunities not available elsewhere. Hell let's blow it all up LOL.
---
The extras sold in the vendor for 2.5k, same with the bear arm plan. I can make them though. I noticed it said Formula Q in game for the animals. P is +3 Luck and +5 charisma, it's perfect chem for farming. I can use up all my daytripper now.
---
Sounds dumb but the RP in me always believed the gouls etc picked the items of the people they killed or corpses they scavenged. Or the one that always made a lot if sense was your just picking up the gear they had before they died
---
Definitely my favorite (human) radio DJ. Hope that if they have another game in the West, we get another Wolfman Jack-like character like Three Dog.
---
Wow. How is anyone supposed to find that when the event keeps you busy killing animals?
---
you can only see this with high perception (10+) otherwise you just see "fun gun store"
---
Yeah maybe the radio host can tell me where this lemonade stand appears.
---
Is this a question from the G.O.A.T. exams?
---
That’s subjective. You already have the answer deep within you. Search deep into your soul and all shall reveal itself in time.
---
Prime on gatling lasers and plasma. When you hit that 40-50 cores you will usually gather enough flux to never run out.
---
That still puts a limit on the number of people that can get loot though. If you make it X%, the max number of people that get loot is 100% ÷ X%. In practicality, people have different levels, weapons, and builds, so you could have someone who does a big portion of the damage and leaves less overall HP for others to try and get, which reduces the number of possible looters even more. Then it becomes the fastest players mowing down as many enemies as they can to ensure they get a piece of the pie, and now you’ve got an entirely new problem and you’re back at square one.
---
I’m not gonna pretend I have a solution to the current issue that the OP is discussing. Your idea, and the possible issues I pointed out, just kind of reinforce my belief that game development and balance can be really fucking complicated. At least you’re actually thinking of solutions, which is more than I can say.
---
Alright you pretentious asshat, at no point have you actually made a point about math. 
---
I brought up two things- one, your poor wording of your intended meaning (“I think my base damage is around 800” would be MUCH clearer wording, if I now understand your intended meaning properly) and two, your description doesn’t make sense because you should be doing more damage than me, yet I 1hit supermutants and you claim not to. If you’re doing 1k+ per swing AND have more ArPen than me, how am I getting 1hits with ~320 base damage, x1.6 for 512 damage, instigating for 1024 (so approx same damage with less ArPen)?
---
That’s what I originally was questioning. There’s your math, explain how that works.
---
It’s just all the jet your on.
---
Bugs are the features of the FO76 now. There are no more problems in the game.

They don't seem to be super rare. I find I'm practically tripping over the beeping officer ghouls and kill them just to make the darn beeping stop!

Yea that’s what I was trying, I went. Power source - counter - terminal - lights. Tried a few other wiring combinations and couldn’t get the counter to work.

I might have been a "Lighting" (file) setting when they pre-rendered items.. and now we have to re-download ALL the items.. but I'm just guessing..

Cool
---
61GB isn’t a big deal.  PC storage is pretty cheap, unless you run SSD
---
Insane we don't have sinks. The basic elements just not in this game is bizarre. Like those abstract modernist paintings. Why do we not have those?
---
I think the NERFs were fine, and perhaps need to go further. 
---
IF I get involved with PvP I want it to be skill and build based not because of God Roll gear (Dupe’d or otherwise)

It's how crustaceans "diddle their fiddle".

That is an awesome idea. I could definitely get on board if this happened.

I agree, the broken toilets needs to be replaced by the metal looking ones we could build in Fo4. And water in a bath tub, that doesn't looks like that its also used for brahmin fodder would be super sweet.

It does the the power terminal only lets you set colors, it does change all to a color or change all to random colors.

Irregardless of "the game allows it" or "it's how the event does it" or "it's Bethesda's fault", ColdestGoose is right.  These Blammers (tm Koopliss) are griefers plain and simple.  This is a multiplayer game, we're on a team in these events and even out in the wasteland.  If you can pass a boon on to your vault-mates, you should, and letting them tag a legendary is very, very easy.

---
That last paragraph about tokens is brilliant by the way.
---
I'll stop suggesting it when it will stop fixing stuff.
---
I actually noticed something weird today. 
---
I had 500 10mm in my vendor and someone came by and bought only 100 rounds of those. 
---
But what I noticed was that it showed me a whole other number in the top screen. 
---
Afterwards the player wanted to check what I had in inventory and I saw a pretty matching number on HIS current amount of 10mm. 
---
Not how many he bought from me.
---
Can confirm they will attack with formula Q. Failed the event with literally .5seconds left because the friendly ran right up to the boss even with me standing between them trying to tank for the friendly. It does make the event easier but also makes the protect the friendly aspect a pain when its actively running at the boss.
---
Well there is a time travel star gate easter egg, with a hollow tape. Maybe the guy actually figured it out?
---
I mean, it was the PvPers that whined until they got nerfed, because the dupers made thousands of them, and explosive bobbleheads, so with PvP basically dead, and most dupers banned, I don't see why not.
---
Most definitely, same here...Bloodied and Unyielding all the way.  The boost in the stats is just insane.  Wouldn't happened to have any extra near 50 Bloodies for sale would ya..a Lever would be great. I got a combat and railway rifle I'm using atm.
---
First time on jet, huh?
---
Know what gets you a guaranteed three star legendary spawn? Making it past stage 2 of the event. Know what makes getting past stage 2 of the event hell? Having your friendly already at half health when suddenly you're tag teamed by an assaultron and a sentry bot out of thin air. Stop treating this like it's an intended mechanic, it's just the games repopulation system going out of control because it wasn't designed with a dungeon liked this in mind.
---
There are a lot of pictures and furniture that would be nice to add. I want a ski ball thingamajig and the commie whacker. I really want those chalk board diagrams in Arktos! Those are nice, would love to hang those bad boys up. They could add them as plans to the event rewards, too.
---
I wonder if that works for the deathclaw hide...?
---
Exploit warning ! 😂
---
What is even more fishy, that patch required 64 GB free space on my SSD...
---
It kinda depends on whether they mean in-game or in this subreddit...
---
Because more radiation baby!!
---
How do you get a 10mm to hit that hard before buffs? Is that what the sheet says, because that's after buffs right?
---
and if something, FO76 loves the SSD :)
---
We have an "Employees Must Wash Hands" sign, but nowhere to do it.
---
On one hand it "kinda" makes sense.   Everytime we log out everything resets.   Enemies, loot, events respawn.  Its almost like being stuck in Groundhog day.
---
And no mater what people like you will complain about people complaining, the difference here is I'm actually trying to be constructive.
---
This is a way better idea than server wide notifications.
---
I dig it
---
Crouch so your not making yourself an easy target on the map.
---
Griefer wont see that your at the workshop and salivate that your not a high level with optimized gear and perk set up.
---
Maybe. The Flatwoods monster has been stalking me for hours now. Haven't seen him since about level 40 though, but I've been doing quests and what not instead of exploring.  
---
The asshole spawned directly under my stilt base.
---
Time to look at that hidden vault.
---
Grafting Dam spawned a T-60 left arm for me yesterday, it was lvl 40 and cried. :(
---
Stop trying to force your morality into others.
---
Bullet-sponge to me mostly means scorchbeast.  IMO those drops are...inadequate.
---
Its before buffs . I have played 1200h soon , i know how they work. Its a BE 10mm yes, but im not running a 20hp build . Just all pistol dmg perks  and bloody mess.
---
Neither. I'm upset with the people that grief other players for "underselling". I'm sorry, but I thought was a more well-known thing.
---
Basically they claim that you (or me, or anybody) selling cheap stuff "ruins the economy" of the game because that stuff "should" be sold for higher. It's called "Flooding the Market" - a powerful, rich company can undercut others and absorb the loss until the competition fails, then raise prices.
---
In the real world it's a problem, in this @#$% imaginary world it simply doesn't matter at all. ;\^)
---
Hope not, since PvP is dead in 76 now. It would be a waste of time, money, and effort to make.
---
It sucks, but whatever. Building a business is hard work.
---
Ah, never mind.  I was hoping the chem would heal the experiments so you can increase their survival chances.
---
Outfit
---
Not sure if you mean in terms of bugs or player community, but both have gotten better with improvements to the game.
---
That being said, there will be moments where you get hit with bugs and issues back to back to back and it seems as broken as it ever was. Stick through those moments, the game is awesome once you get to the other side. I have faith it will just continue to improve; every patch they knock out 4 or 5 more issues. ^^and ^^add ^^two ^^more ^^new ^^ones
---
Use pacify then block said dummies...Bam, they wont bother you anymore
---
&gt;Probably adding new stuff to the atom store
---
No, New lighting... now you can buy a new "light" :P
---
Reminds me of playing Skyrim. There was a mod called like jd's repositioner or something. I ran around the whole map, finding furniture and decor for my home. 
---
...that's a nice throne you got there, Ulfric, be a shame if someone took it.
---
Ofc perks are in there. But its before adrenaline
---
Doesn't really help for an install that has broken *now*.
---
Does that hit Camp Adams?
---
I'd be curious to see what the Campfire event looks like in a rad zone.
---
It downloaded and installed for me with only 44gb free.
---
Would you rather fight one deathclaw sized radroach or 50 radroach sized deathclaws?
---
Sometimes I think I have a cool camp and then I think back to the monstrosities I built in f4 and I get sad. Most of those were accomplished using the budget glitch so builds that large would never be possible in this game sadly. I had some camps where if I'd place one more item the game would crash. Ha
---
Its just bizarre some of the basic building items they just decided to not include (yet) in this game. Why? Seems weird to make us wait a year for an atom shop version of a basic build item.
---
It's really tough solo. Won't lie. Having so much in CHA takes away from everything else. But... it does work. It just takes a really different, patient style of play.
---
I was there yesterday and got around 6 Legendaries.
---
Haha! I would agree with that based on my own anecdotal experiences as well!
---
I am wondering could this be related to the fact that wasn't the 9.5 Patch for PC supposed to be 1GB as per their release notes, but it was like 8,5GB. 
---
Like since they messed up something badly in the last update, this is also large since they have to repair the messed up files...?
---
You can get your melee damage up to around 300 with a supersledge and the right perks
---
It reminds me of fo3 and the mr.handy that was in your home in megaton.
---
Maybe a dataminer can check the loot pool and see what else is in their?
---
Team up with people who are jerks. Especially high level ones. I'm level 40. I know I'm not super high but give me a couple months and that'll change. GT is yowieboogey. That's too bad. Most people I've come acrossed are cool. Use explosives on bullies. It may not kill em but it'll annoy em.
---
No, not at all.
---
The proper analogy would be;
---
Both the cyclist and the car are entitled to the road. The cyclist doesn't have to "get on the fucking sidewalk" because the car says so.
---
I sometimes use the blade of Bastet on heavy gunner 
---
I think it’s how you perceive value
---
Do you prefer repeatedly swinging a fast blade at 1/2 the damage or
---
Swing a heavy hammer that does 2x the damage at 1/2 the speed?
---
Approximately my blade vs my all rise
---
Pacify only stops you from attacking others by mistake it doesn’t stop them from attacking your base right?
---
Plus I don’t want to lose a tame
---
There's been a few posts about it over at Filthy Casuals. People being griefed for "underselling". Here's the most recent example:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/bs9w27/filthy\_casual\_or\_destabilizing\_the\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/bs9w27/filthy_casual_or_destabilizing_the_market/) 
---
It's like somebody screaming at a child about currency devaluation because they threw a quarter into a wishing well.
---
"Hey Bill, these nerds are real pissed. You're fired."
---
For now, I use the chemist work bench, the L-shaped one, in my kitchens since it has a sink built in. Don't mind the meth lab next to it, though. 
---
Doesn't really work out so well in bathrooms.
---
*aren't jerks
---
This laptop is mainly for her school work, we put in a 250gb SSD to give the machine a chance to run FO76 (load times are a bitch). It's not a "main" system.
---
Why does everyone complain about downloading such n such gigs?  They have a shit computer and/or internet or something?  God damn people complain a lot.
---
What platform? Is there a way for people to organize that’s actually used and reliable?
---
??
---
You know, about that...I searched all the hospitals and labs then found an open crate of them right where you say.  What is *up* with that?
---
I 100% agree. But, if all that character can do is pop shots with his lowly pipe rifle, then he IS trying to contribute.
---
Now... if I show up with my "Medic" character, and I spend all my time healing and reviving characters... do I not deserve a payout at the end of it all?
---
Yes, expecting online about 5-6pm til' say 11pm CST
---
then again various times throughout Sat-Mon(Yes I have Mon off)
---
Ah well GG Bethesda, that's another 10 hours (or 24 if someone wants to actually use the internet here today) I cant play your game while it updates.
---
This is exactly what I feared would happen
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/braydy/comment/eocjr8x
---
Yeah I have shitty internet, but given Beth said the prior update was supposed to be 1gb and was 8gb, and that they say that the update for people that hadn't dlled that update yet only need a smaller update it's clear Bethesda messed up something.
---
&gt;best Camp locations with water and a view
---
I took a walk through there, looking for a good camp spot. Found the place in the video you mention. Someone was already setting up their new camp.
---
Oddly, I've had good luck on the lower part of the cliff near.. uh, nevermind.
---
They are, if they want pvp them play on those servers
---
Camps are passive unless you are agro’d to someone. So put on your passive. :)
---
True, but i have heard about cases where they get "friends" to spot for them and then joins the server and do their shit again...
---
1. But to the OP, more info would be nice, did you have a workshop, where you in PVP beta mode ? what system are you on, what level ? and what is this grifer doing to you ?
---
Ty didn’t realize that
---
But what does that thing actually do?!
---
Hi! Others have already linked to [our post on the forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/344578/pc-fallout-76-update-may-24-2019?language%5B%5D=en), but just to confirm, this update was to address a lighting file issue on PC only. This issue was also the reason why Patch 9.5 was 8+ GB on PC rather than 1GB as we had originally communicated in the patch notes for 9.5.
---
We realize this is inconvenient for those of you who had already downloaded the patch, but it's going to help reduce the download size greatly for players who haven't yet installed 9.5. Thanks for your patience!
---
#NerdRage
---
If you don't engage them, they can't hurt you.  
---
What is the problem?
---
Id take anything at this point. I cant wear my T-60 or T-51 because Im always overencumbered with all the stuff I have to carry
---
Gonna have to disagree. It's actually been really nice not having to listen to the same 10 voice lines over and over again when listening to the radio.
---
I'd be fine with it as long as it was a separate station though. Like how New Vegas did it.
---
Block the players or switch servers...ive never had a problem with anyone, you must be doing something to puss people off
---
There you go. Only a matter of time til you busted out a completely nonsensical response.
---
IF the one-shot player magically didn't know that his purpose-built-to-one-shot-enemies character was gonna, ya know... one-shot that enemy, well, we're not talking about that player.
---
We're talking about the player that knows. and does. and then justifies it with a bullshit "well, I can, so therefore I should" logic.
---
I thought they could still bust up your camp
---
It sounds to me like a glowing sea world for higher level players who have become legendary. At least that's what i got from the description
---
Mostly I listen to Old Crow Medicine Show while I play.
---
fyi, people can see that you're the original poster of the thread
---
sounds like you have too much stuff
---
&gt;Why does everyone complain about downloading such n such gigs?  They have a shit computer and/or internet or something?  God damn people complain a lot.
---
No because Bethesda has fucked up the installer, our laptop wants to download 61gb.  
---
Get fucked troll.
---
So they can’t kill your tame anymore if you don’t Afro them?
---
Not since a couple updates ago.
---
ammo should sell by 5s...
---
Aggro lol
---
Still pissed about the latest nerfs. The gun itself wasn't enough to make you untouchable. Even with the perks for my shotty the challenge was still there. If they are worried about PVP being one sided, then why don't they change the effectiveness of them in survival or just against other players? Explosive weapons are a little better than base weapons you can pick up or craft.
---
Such a perfect idea!!!
---
I sell almost all ammo at 1 cap per.  I’m not trying to “ruin” anyone’s economy. One person’s ammo stash is valuable to them, but nothing more than a commodity in the game world. What the complainers fail to realize is the market is one of cost versus demand, and the rarity of what you’re selling. Ammo isn’t rare. Your personal situation might result in a short supply situation, but the ammo itself isn’t. It’s just that you don’t have much of it. 
---
What the people bitching at you are really trying to do is price-fix for their own gain. I mean seriously, the clowns trying to sell shotgun shells at 5 caps per? Ridiculous.
---
I'll buy it if your on xbox
---
Haha, that reminds me of a mod for Fo4, you would go out into the world and find items (ash trays, toys, cutlery), then put them into a machine in your settlement (same way as you put in food at Mama Murphys) and it would come out the other end as a static item for you to grab in workshop mode and place down. Once placed, it couldn't be moved by any other force than workshop mode, it was awesome.
---
Had this happen like... too many times to count. Those pipes outside bug sometimes and I can't fix the last even if it's marked right in front of me.
---
Depending on the price I'll buy if your on xbox
---
I definitely feel ya. I'd make huge places in fo4, then never return because my fps took such a huge hit, haha. I've been spoiled by mods and all the extra static objects they added. 
---
Hopefully they'll add more things we find in the world to camps. And I sure hope it's not just all Atom Shop add-ons, toss some new plans on a vendor or make Grahmn have great again and add it to his inventory. (I think the only thing you can't find elsewhere but him is mirror ball and marquee arrows).
---
Allowing us to bulk it and sell "by the box" would be nice.
---
Thanks a lot didn’t realize. All good now
---
My fears came true
---
Another 8gb download.
---
I ran into him for the first time a couple weeks ago in the Toxic Valley.  I'm assuming its a newer encounter as I hadn't seen him before either.
---
This is the dumbest use of the term griefing I've seen used here, and people use it in this sub in the most backwards way possible.  
---
Congratulations, you have absolutely no grasp on what the term means. Go look it up. Explain how it can remotely reply to the situation you've used it for. At least previous people had a shaky argument if you squinted. Yours is absolutely stupid.
---
Just don’t defend them. You still own them if they become over run. Also if the workshop is over run another player cannot claim it without clearing the enemies.
---
I run Fallout 76 on a 250gb SSD but no other games or large applications, everything else like Video and my music is on other drives. Currently I have 110gb free.
---
What is taking up the space is my question, school work would be documents, they are tiny.
---
Good luck regardless, sounds like Mom &amp; Dad are going to be working on this laptop for a while.
---
yeah, really hard lol :D
---
They said they messed up in the forum post, it happens. If you're getting like 2mbps download rates, I'm surprised you can stay connected to play the game at all
---
So what are those funny with arms and legs things in the explosion?  I've got a photo with a couple of then too.
---
I dont care if they do BR and or TDM/DM..
---
people who are into pvp will be stoked on it if it isnt too broken..
---
get White Knight.  I have over 140 fiber from the savings from this perk.
---
Yes there’s a bug where the number it shows when you sell ammo is actually the number of ammo the buyer has, not how many you sold, and this is why everyone is posting about not getting enough caps from selling because they think they’ve sold more than they have
---
You just gotta let go. You're never gonna use that one star nocturnal black powder rifle anyway and nobody wants to buy it. Just sell it or drop it at a train station
---
:-p
---
I think you should be able to get unlimited scrip but you could only spend like 200 a day at the vendor.
---
Ty
---
I'm on xbox. 
---
Happy to let it go for 500 caps or so if you want a 2-shot
---
The problem isnt that you can't solo the entire thing with all three objectives, the problem is you can barely even scratch a single objective to get a chance at even the lowest tier of rewards. Even under the best situations trying to do this event with even with two or three players means at best you might manage a single tier 2 friendly if even that and then you're likely to end up getting screwed over by a particularly tough wave or someone new respawning all the robots or the alpha popping up under you and eating the friendly.
---
And it is possible to use mechanics to allow for the same tagging opportunity as a massive health pool. Like the alpha having ridiculous defense or mitigation until certain conditions are met.
---
The last one is quite funny and I feel it would fit the game quite well. However Bethesda should be careful with fluff and joke announcements such ad that one. If you hear that same ad 3-4 times it will quickly lose its shine. So far nothing in fo76 has stood out like Preston Garvey and his settlement lines did in fo4. But it's not like there are many NPCs you regularly interact with either.
---
It might be worth considering playing each joke for every player only once or twice per real life week/month. The game is always online, why not tie some other in-game things like jokes on the radio to it?
---
umm .. i mean .. wha ... just ... idontevenknowwhattosayatthispoint
---
Can you try getting the deathclaw hide off of the always there deathclaw bodies around one of the fissure sites near Prime?
---
I don't know it to be there but that's where I'd look first.. else I'd try the level 91 glowing death claw always near that (forgot the name) power station just NNW of Watoga.
---
I must undersell all my ammo it's a cap a round and I think that it is a high price but it sells. It's a free market nobody should dictate what other players sell merchandise for. Most of my stuff is cheap because I would rather sell to a Player then sell to robot ( nothing against robots).
---
Kill and save and sell, lol.  
---
I just hit 50 last night. I went from 25 to 50 in about two days (maybe 10 - 12 hours) by doing quests, events, and just exploring and killing.  
---
Also, weapons DON'T change that much from each level step, be it 5 to 15, or 20 to 30. They gain a bit of damage, but you can just mod your lower level to deal increased damage. Enemies may be level 40 or so, but that doesn't mean you can't take them out. It will be more of a challenge, but it's completely doable.   
---
At level 12 I was attacked by a vengeful mothman, lv42. I killed him. It was a fight, but I won.   
---
Once I got power armor, I was still scared of everything until nearly lv30 when I realized I could take on lv50 scorchbeasts and whatnot. It takes a lot more ammo than it does now, but it was still doable and not as scary as I thought it would be. And the higher level the enemies, the more XP you get for killing them, and the better loot.  
---
Also make sure you always have well rested, it's not much, but it's still a 5% Xp increase.  
---
Once you have a CAMP set up, build some purifiers, as many as you can. Sell the purified water to vendors. That's an easy and dependable way to make some caps.
---
TLDR; Kill everything. Don't be afraid of higher level monsters, they're more XP and better loot. Worst that happens is you lose some junk. Sell purified water. Always be well rested.  
---
Also just take everything that's not nailed down and scrap/sell it.
---
Me again, 15% spare budget, 21 random encounter normal deathclaw below bridge south of harpers ferry, char level 156 WW3 perk equiped... only pacify :(
---
Teach me your ways!
---
I clear out West-Tek at least 2 times a day or every time I play. Sometimes I will get no legendaries at all, and the next time I run it, I get 2-6 legendaries in one go. It's just really random, even though it doesn't seem like it.
---
Thank you for the response Valseek.
---
Happens occasionally but not sure if it's intentional. I had a level 68 scorched appear at one of my camps near the overseers camp.
---
My closest photo to a nuke I'm in shiny power armor and I appear to be partly transparent.
---
What do you mean?
---
&gt; scorched plague being localized exclusively to west virginia
---
If the Vault 76 dewllers didnt stop the Queen it would have spread. We the players are the reason scorched have died out.
---
&gt;cargobots - government supply boxes
---
There is 175 years between the start of 76 and Fallout 3. That is a long time, things are going to get looted. Considering i shoot them down every-time i see one it would be harder to believe that they survived or even kept operating for 175 years.
---
&gt; lack of humans is completely ridiculous
---
You said it yourself the Scorch is "another apocalyptic event". Yeah im sure someone survived but im guessing anyone that could got out of the area to avoid the Scorch and the Scorched Plague.
---
Lets say a random family does comes into the Area. If the come from the north east they hit The Fair Grounds its full of Scorch infected humans. Say they survive and continue on they get to Flatwoods, everyone there is dead, push on to Charleston, Flooded and everyone dead. Whats further past that Ash Heap. Straight North they have to move through the Toxic Valley. Then they hit Morgantown, completely wiped out by Scorched. North West the Mire lots of nasty creatures there and many pockets of Super Mutants. But maybe doable, anything they did build would be overrun by vines though best bet is get setup in an abandoned Free State bunker. East they head for Watoga and get murdered by assultrons. South East they are smack dab into ScorchBeast territory. Directly south the Savage divide any area they explore there would be abandoned Raider territory which is also full of Super Mutants. Why the hell would anyone stick around after seeing all that.
---
&gt;Brotherhood, Enclave
---
Been a big fan since 3 and read the wikis extensively but i haven't seen anything that contradicts anything form those game. Some Retcons but nothing really broken. But you cant please everyone and things Change just ask fans of Star Wars, Star Trek, Comics, etc. Writers and Creators are going to change things so they can tell a story.
---
Yes. Yes I did - thanks to your description which specifically stated it was from the entry in front of you when you spawn at Whitesprings - that and the wall colours of course.
---
Nahh Assaultron just really hurts not to mention the armored piercing gutsy
---
Do make sure to backup...
---
C:\\Users\\*username*\\Documents\\My Games
---
maybe be, if using OneDrive
---
C:\\Users\\*username*\\OneDrive\\Documents\\My Games
---
onto a USB thumb drive just in case you need to nuke the whole OS and start again and the school work also of course.
---
Yeah I was hoping someone would have formula q drop. We noticed too, it's better to put 58 venison in the hopper for the yaogao. The damn deathclaw is out of control.
---
I'm gonna try to save them all, but spreading ourselves thin. I almost solo'd it but had to stay engaged with the squatch, you cripple and he hunches over like the queen. The wolf was out getting attacked by yaogao and crickets though, died before I could nuke off all the health. Was so close, but duo's is money.
---
Jealous you got the diffuser! Maybe we'll try this weekend and see if more people are on.
---
Not the character name, just the display name. It will still be on all your characters.
---
I'll take it but I cant be on for awhile

---
Doing the work that Bethesda programmers don't have the time for...brilliant! Sure beats tabbing over and down through the menus. And even then, it doesn't clue you in to what's in the vicinity. Thanks!
---
That’s a good point. I’ve seen the mothman so much it’s getting annoying, and then I’ll hear people mentioning how they’ve never seen it before at all.
---
My actual IGN is DwaynesWorld! So call me Dwayne haha. I'll be on around that time as well and I'm off monday too
---
Could you give him your loot?
---
Now i just need to know your platform and if it's PC i need your ign°°. Images look fantastic. Great idea :)
---
&gt;Get fucked troll?  Wow, calm down badass
---
Ignore me, I'm just pissed I can team play the game tonight.
---
Thanks! Hopefully it will catch on. Let's make our own content!
---
Work smart man. I saw a duo go harass someone who took workshop. I had too much junk on me to risk. I head over there anyway since its adventure mode. Naturally its the classic ambush trap where one melees you and the other tries to shoot you the second you attack back. So i ran around him for awhile before they finally gave up. Now thanks to player vending i found his camp. It took some work and some luck but those mongrels i led to his camp ate up some walls and beds. It was great fun, especially when he came to his camp to kill the mongrel now in his house. I tried to get a SB there but he'd only attack the camp 2 times than fly away no matter if i attacked it. Walls maybe cheap to repair but using a little creativity to annoy the annoyers is rich with hilarity.
---
It worked for me as well - also greg's mine supply works and is a shorter route
---
Get a better laptop or move your laptop upstairs instead of your moms basement
---
Yeah if you are pacifist they can't do anything.
---
 Killed a Scorchbeast with my Lever Action yesterday. Semd about right.
---
can you tell me why the team function continually is having issues?   i have to relog in and out to get teams to work  4-7 times per day.
---
i go there for weapons to break down for steel ALOT, usually net about 500 steel per run with scrapper.. last night i had a run with 3 x 3\* lvl 68 legendaries, 1 x 2\* legendary, and 3 x no star legendaries. but i have had a TON of runs with none.. its hit and miss with em.
---
I love that spot. I got a quaint lil basketball court on top lmao.
---
I don't like cockroach so i'll go for 50 rad roach sized desthclaw
---
I unfortunately do not know what percent that animals take up in your budget - I can try to check when I get home as my Deathclaw is currently the only thing not stored at my camp and let you know
---
What about the cargo bot? I got the vertigo no problem but the cargobot I can’t seem to get a pic of
---
Thank you for saying this! The second I enter your camp you'll make me over encumbered when you do that!
---
Bring a gamma gun. Use that all the time to control health, even on my main who's not bloodied.
---
No. I like how mine sits right at the top of the stairs going into my base.
---
I will however put a manual switch on it and keep it powered off. 😜
---
Well I'm glad to have have helped.
---
i got the update patch late yesterday, works fine.
---
tbh, i built my gaming box for capacity, i'm not too concerned about software patch mgmt.
---
Would be very much appreciated. I've now found 3 since patch 9 and tried many things but cannot for the life of me tame one. Also only found 1 other animal inbetween and it's already dead &gt;\_&lt;
---
No I'm not saying that at all - people who support by providing stims and reviving downed players - that's contributing in my book. Standing there doing nothing - I've literally watched players get on high vantage points away from damage and then do nothing at all.
---
50 low level ghouls or a bullet spongr hmm....
---
It's enjoyable to test weapons to 50 low level ghoul but....
---
I can't feel the impact of my games without HIGH DAMAGE NUMBERS!!!!! BETHESDA GIVE US DAMAGE NUMBERS!!!
---
This is *another* patch.
---
Huh, hadn’t checked! Wait until you see the gauss rifle. Energy weapon for crafting, affected by Grounded mutation as if it were an energy weapon, but does ballistic damage and the 2mm EC ammo is covered by Bandolier, not Batteries included.
---
Pacifist on, then block the player. After that they won't even see you in the map.
---
I really tried 2-3 times pressing E to interact, but it only changed the sentences to try to coerce me :|
---
I’ve been hardlining psychobuffs like it’s my day job
---
If they have window near any crafting bench you can pretty easily get into their camps. Also fast traveling to their spot the before all the prices load in go to the middle of their camps and wait
---
Bethesda is in Austin Texas, so it's OK, "It's Texas, everyone has a Gun"
---
Yeah, you're saying fully charged doubles the listed damage but that's not right. Fully charged gives you the listed damage.
---
I aim to please!
---
This is a genuine bug buddy. Stop acting like Bethesda is perfect because they made the game playable.
---
Or they could just buy the undercut items and sell at "normal price". 
---
Was a normal practice when i played ffxiv. If you need currency quickly hop into market and undercut. Those that are already invested in that market swoop in to buy cheap item and sell at normal price for profit since they are willling to wait until it sells at their target price. Both win.
---
It would of been neat if you gave them loot and got something in return.
---
Yeah I think they’ve added in some newish encounters. I ran into the aftermath of a bloody battle; but it wasn’t like they just stumbled across each other, there was a pile of supermutants that I could loot (even though I never hit them) and there was a level 1 supermutant limping away and it was called an “injured supermutant”
---
I don't understand people who complain about games/events being to difficult. It means YOU are the one who lacks in skill/gear. Go grind for it elsewhere and come back later. There are thousands of players who complete this event solo just fine, yet you with your plasma grenades and pipe rifle is complaining about the freaking robot respawns? Should the Alpha also be at 1% hp when it spawns? Because wee-waa it's so stwong? Let me ask this again; is this a joke?
---
You can use this to your advantage, though. Throw down two on top of each other, wait until an enemy runs near/on top of them and throw the third. You’ve now remote-detonated them instantly as opposed to the stupid 2-3 second delay that makes mines basically useless.
---
Omg, i cant stop loughting, i can see it in front of me :D
---
Neat welcome for new wastelanders lol - running straight back to the vault while screaming
---
She got bloody hundreds of photos on it, I know that much. The hampster, the budgie, the dogs, her siblings. Whatever video project she was working on, etc, etc.  
---
*Obviously* she's got all this backed up safely....
---
Ahhhh this is a great idea!
---
Tell that to the crafting menu. Or the Grounded mutation. Gauss are a weird hybrid.
---
The Gauss Rifle is all over the place it’s classed as an energy weapon but does ballistic damage. Imo it should be in the ballistic category because it fires ballistic rounds but uses energy to fire those rounds.
---
Sir/Ma'am - You are as brave as clever.
---
Ask someone to download it for you while youre away.  I have my wife do it when im at work so i dont have to sit there with my finger in my ass waiting for it to download.  I get what you mean though dude.  Im fucking addicted to this game and want it to be better.  I guess im just biased since i love everything Bethesda.  I cant hear people talk but they can hear me and it pisses me off but i know theyll fix it
---
If your going to try and falsly bump the number of responses to make it look like people agree with you, try and use a different account. We all know your the OP.
---
I primed my Resolute Veteran, and I find it really nice for scorched earth. With rank 3 heavy gunner (all 3 perk cards) bloody mess and adrenaline rank 3, I can oneshot most high level scorched. And if I max out adrenaline plus damage chems I can actually see the health on the queen go down (it’s not much but it is noticeable). I am right around ~200 damage. And I only use about 2k 5mm rounds per queen run. I get way more violet flux, so it is a net increase for ammo.
---
I use a switch so it's controllable.  I'd recommend having some toxic goo with you.  then the rad showers are irrelevant.
---
Yeah it’s a major inconvenience haha much appreciate the shower but I’m drowning in radaways anyways
---
The Bloatfly isn't too bad to defend because it's flying and easy to follow at least for me - but very squishy and must be very defended. 
---
And I also can't get far with radkelp - I've gotten 30 in there at most x.x it just doesn't respawn fast enough
---
I completely agree. Luckily I havent ran into that issue quite yet. But I know I'd be pissed
---
As much as I love the ghouls, they've become dull and repetitive. They need to actually build in some mechanical variation to match all the different name types. 
---
* Reavers should be much more resistant to ballistic considering they retain scraps of armor. 
---
* Glowing Ones should be able to use their AOE radiation blast to damage enemies while healing surrounding ghouls.
---
* Roamers and Stalkers should be solitary with Roamers ambling across larger areas (perhaps being rare and tough legendary spawns) while Stalkers only move at night and have a high sneak attack crit strike of some sort. 
---
* The Gangrenous and Glowing variants are the only Ghouls with some noticeable sort of mechanic, but I feel they can be improved. 
---
All that aside, a single massive bullet sponge enemy would be fun if it had more interesting abilities and better pathfinding. I ran into a group of *THREE* Enraged Fog Crawlers and they were both spongey enough to be tough, and had interesting attacks and movements. The Sheepsquatch is also a fun enemy (mostly) but has the issue of becoming totally incapable of combat when it's legs are crippled (for the most part).
---
You haven’t faced the Imposter or the new event bosses, have you?
---
I wondered if Toxic Goo would remedy this.  How many Rads does it add to your health bar?
---
It's a team healing item - kinda like a group stimpak
---
These two are nearly impossible to complete... unless with real life luck perk equipped.
---
Unpopular opinion, but these weapons are supposed to be rare. Everyone has them because of Bethesda's negligence. In a game where you have to grind and grind and grind to get mediocre loot, I can't really blame someone for just wanting to end the mindless battle that requires very little skill or challenge to begin with. On top of that, legendary loot disappears exponentially quicker as there are more people in the event.
---
Quick question for you...why is the raider PA getting so popular now?  Ive seen a bunch of people using it lately
---
You need to drop some loot on the ground to complete the quest
---
Xbox, I play with a large group where we frequently have 3 or more teams working together on things, and we use the XBL Party Chat instead of Game Chat.
---
I know PS4 has a similar system and PC players can use Discord Chat groups.
---
Very cool, thanks for the info!
---
Did you listen to his dialog? He gives a hint as to what they fought ;)
---

---
super.. see ya then... Hope ya got a mic. way too hard to work with those that don't.
---
For me since I have a new character I think it’s just level requirements.  Raider armor is 15, not sure what the other armors go down to.  Plus might be easy to mod maybe?  I dunno
---
Ok I bit the bullet, specced 6 points (from 4) into charisma and put on both animal friend and wastelander whisperer and I could tame it.
---
Either you need both perks equipped or there is a minimum requirement for base charisma (before buffs) &gt;4
---
If you drop a piece of loot he will be satisfied and let you go.  I gave him a sheepsquatch skull iirc.  He seemed satisfied.  FYI If you pick it back up he goes hostile.  Just a fun encounter that adds NPC flavor to a game that desperately needs it.
---
That's why I added a manual switch to mine. Plus I've got about 3 entrances and it's not in any of them atm.
---
Not really I kill them with 6 shots
---
If anyone is on PS4 and selling these plans I'm in the market. Out of the handful of times I was actually able to beat it the best I ever got was the lab coat. Between getting people and people actually doing something this mission is going to drive me insane.
---
If they'd given any notice that it was happening I would have left the machine running with the launcher open, we've already had our big patch this week.
---
Yeah I don't see a difference in one shot or none. SBQ isn't an area where this is a problem. It's issues with events where there are events with legendary enemies that have 500 HP.
---
I haven't played my bloodied build in awhile.  Going back to it after completing my medic build but last time I ran it, it took about 4-6 toxic goos to get my nerd rage to proc from full heath. They are heavy though.  I would fill a bunch from West Tek and carry 10 or so on me at all times.
---
The only issue I take with low levels being at such events is when they start calling for help every single time they go down, which is a lot. Don't put yourself in a stupid situation and make yourself everybody else's problem.
---
But is any of it incorrect? I double checked my math three times.
---
😱 That’s brilliant, thank you so much!
---
The backups are essential, then all she needs to do is delete all the photos and videos on the main C: Windows OS drive, update the backups first! Then make a backup of the backup and a second. It is said that we don't really have a backup of data unless we have three of them. 
---
Some extra drives and the time is of no consequence if it means not losing precious photos and videos etc external drives with huge capacity are relatively cheap now.
---
I didn’t but I assume it was a sheepsquatch😂
---
They could always just do what they did in fo4 with codsworth and record a really long list of names. Then if your name is on the list he will simply use it and if not it can revert to "vault dweller" or something.
---
They were very lenient with the system in fo4 allowing names such as nipple, fuckface, boob, boobie and lets not forget; boobies. All seamlessly integrated into codsworth's conversations. 
---
Perhaps the BoS is right in not trusting humans with advanced technology after all
---
My gaming machine is the same, this is a laptop with sufficient storage until Bethesda's patching mechanism fucks up.
---
Actually "freeloaders" do affect. 
---
\- Their presence scales up the event difficulty as the game spawns more trash mobs, causing waste of ammo for those participating
---
\- The boss HP scales up -&gt; more ammo lost, chance of losing fight because timeout
---
\- Their mere presence causes more lag
---
\- Inflation aspect.. they cause more legendaries to exist in the fallout, thus reducing their uniqueness and worth. can't sell legendaries to these freeloaders if they get them for free
---
So yea. Freeloaders do affect very negatively, as in every multiplayer game, and should be banned and have their gaming devices disconnected from Internet until end of days.
---
 Ok I bit the bullet, specced 6 points (from 4) into charisma and put on both animal friend and wastelander whisperer and I could tame it.
---
TL;DR Can't tame deathclaw with 4 charisma and WW3, CAN tame deathclaw with charisma 6, unsure if both cards needed
---
Yup!
---
you had one job. imagine releasing a bugged 9GB patch to fix bugs and then releasing another 9GB just three days later to fix the bug that‘s been introduced with the earlier patch. 
---
i know you didn‘t have a hand in this, but you gotta realize that this is frustrating. 
---
some of us pay for bandwith. a „thanks for your patience“ doesn‘t feel like enough, but i know not to expect anything when the Duffle Kerfuffle victims themselves only received like 5$ in atoms. 
---
just please, for the love of atom, keep those 10GB updates to a minimum.
---
This worked for me as well.
---
This.  
---
What on earth are you doing with 2 mules full of stuff?
---
Did it though...
---
Well I am glad you were able to tame it!
---
Lol he's done it twice
---
I do that all the time. Half my inventory is resells. Thanks to all the people who sell an 8k item for 600 caps. I appreciate you all.
---
I’ve seen it done trying to catch people during campfire tales. As far as I could tell from the map, it worked...
---
Backup isn't a backup unless it's a redundant backup.  
---
People never learn until the lose something.
---
I'm curious what this is in reference to.  We've had the weird terrain lighting issue, but that wasn't a direct result of Patch 9.5 (I think it started in Patch 9).  Other than that, I haven't noticed anything unusual about thr lighting since 9.5.
---
Put up a looking for group on the community area of whatever console you play. "Sheepsquatch in 5, join on me" or whatever. Usually does the trick.
---
My sides are flying lightspeed right now.
---
Works best if you have a decent number of folks participating. But if you know what you're doing, it takes like a minute to run down there and grab the shutdown code. Also, since you can visit the location in between event runs, you can explore and get the lay of the land. The code to the door is printed on three printouts scattered across the three biomes. There's also at least one holotape and some terminal entries that give a bit more lore about the place to check out when things are a bit more quiet.
---
Or up to like 1700 with a bloodied melee build
---
This whole game is built upon levels and builds, which is why they recommend a team of high level players for Scorched Earth. Right now it is already a taggers' heaven, many level 20 players rush to boss fights to get their XP and loot, tag a few rounds and hide until the boss is dead. The top contributors don't get a better rolling pin than the tagging team. If every single player's ability to loot the boss is the priority, no change is needed. 
---
Actually even better, when the boss is dead, everyone on the map gets a random legendary no matter where you are, everyone will be happy and nobody worries about a few asshats killing the boss too fast. But then they will be mad because no asshats will show up to kill the boss, everyone wants free stuff for 0 effort, it's just human nature.
---
Vote with your caps. Aka don't buy their stuff. Easy.
---
I have a 3* vampires LMG idk what other effect it has atm
---
Thanks! Been going crazy since patch 9 trying to get one and your the only poster I've seen to say it works
---
It really is the most unsettling thing in the game.
---
New skins in the cash shop.
---
One I used last night was 84 rads I believe
---
Good point
---
The PSA is not to not have them in your doorways, but to have them on a switch, I always put mine at my door way but have a switch for it.
---
Makes sense
---
I have no idea how it works. And I server hope for parts all the time, I used to take the frames when I had room for my collection in stash, but now that i keep some of it in inv, I dont take them anymore. I dont see a difference. If ur on xbox I can give u whatever parts u need
---
They’re upset because you’re hurting their profit margin, pure and simple. They wouldn’t give a shit otherwise.
---
meh it's just another patch.
---
Save your energy, dude’s whole account is crying about 76. If he’s not a troll he’s the saddest person I’ve seen in a while.
---
No blocking required
---
I have a "Freebies" machine that I throw excess ammo into.  Yes, I'm literally giving it away.  Makes more sense than leaving it in the suitcase at Watoga these days, since no one goes there anymore.
---
You mean Marine tactical helmet your mass manufacturing right because the Marine assault helmet is the one nobody can find in game
---
Peer review of players. Give thumb up or 1-5 stars for fellow players, show stats for dps/dmg done, healing done, damage taken, whatever.. 
---
Let players who get shit reviews play on the shit servers with other shit for faces. über pro players would drift to their own servers and casuals like me would have good times with each other.
---
I sell for what I want, when I want.  I have noticed a sharp increase in the cost of serums since player vending, so I sell what I have for under because I can.  No where do I get a buff for having a huge number of caps.  I sell stuff to pay for the stuff I want to buy, and thats it.
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox, just need a lvl 15 left left and right arm.  I got pretty lucky and got most of what I needed in 2 hops, just stopped getting the frame to spawn after I picked it up.
---
o_o i need it
---
If you decide to follow the coordinates flip to page 122. If you decide to ignore the message flip to page 65. If you run outside to try and catch who threw the radio flip to page 200.
---
I have a theory that those are from a scorchbeast. You can get occasional neutral SB over the forest, but if a highlevel attacks them and they go hostile, well, SB spawn scaled Scorched to assist them, so suddenly you’ve got L68 Scorched chasing you in the forest.
---
I am, Shockwave IIC, I can be on from now for up to 6 hours.
---
Personally I have a hard time getting 150 in a day. The legendary grind just isn't worth it. You're chasing something you will never get. I like it where it's at or people could do a bunch of rolls a day and good legendary weapons kind of loose their value.
---
That would be great!
---
My friends do call me lucky - may or may not have gotten two paladin paints and 3 elder paints from tech data in one day ._. if only it would carry over to legendary drops.. i just want that faster swing speed shovel q.q
---
Buy another PS4 you say....
---
Let's do a mental exercise where we imagine all of that is taking place in the context of a video game...wait it actually is. So play your game. If you want beat the boss because a couple more people showed up then you have some things to worry about on your end before examining the impact of other players.
---
You obviously don't know what inflation means, because you're actually talking about supply and demand. The legendaries aren't worth less, they are simply not in demand because those seeking them already have them. The person that needs said item will still be inclined to acquire said item.
---
This of course all fails to take into account the relative impact of players missing out on loot they "earned" versus that of "unearned" (a topic that is in an of itself highly debatable) loot awarded to "freeloaders."
---
Find a different, more relavant hill to die on, friend. A change that would allow everyone that shows up to get loot benefits you, the current system does not and already carries all of the negatives of the former without the benefits.
---
I mean they kind of have to considering they're compressing an entire state into an area we have to be able to walk across if needed lol
---
From doing the event and seeing what comes out at different ranks. Also from reading what other people doing the event have witnessed at the different ranks. 
---
Rank 0 will give you radroaches and bloatflies
---
Rank 1 got me a mirelurk
---
Rank 2 got me a sloth
---
Rank 3 I've heard will get you a deathclaw or equivelant
---
TIL France is a race, not a nation. Will the lies in modern education never end???
---
Awesome I'll probably be on in roughly 4-5 hours
---
I must be stupidly lucky. The two times I've done the event I got the formula p and then the lab coat the second time and that's just with keeping one animal alive.
---
Junkies outperforms bloodied until you hit 19% hp at which point bloodied takes over. That's assuming you're okay with all the negatives that junkies brings (you're looking at 8+ lost special points to deal damage similar to bloodied.) Ofc that assumes you're at junkies maxed damage which is 5 addictions. If you play the nerd rage bloodied variant then bloodied is 25-30% better, if you like to keep your hp at 50-30% then junkies is 10-15% more damage at the cost of all those special points. Bloodied is clearly superior imo, but I can't manage to get a damn bloodied explosive weapon and I have two nice junkies explosive.
---
I play the same way.  Going to give my view.
---
For strength drop traveling pharmacy and put those perk points into max blocker.
---
280 gaps at a vendor for 30. Not cheap but I bought a few and now I find enough to keep a steady supply. Ballistic fiber isn't that hard for me to find between the military duct tape, bags, and loot form enemies.
---
At level 180 I have never once obtained plans from scrapping an outfit.
---
For sure
---
Visual bug that displays buyers inventory number rather than how much you sold to them.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Left left lol. I have 3 sets of 15 so I got you covered, I can give u a level 25 excavator or T-45 set as well if ud like for when you get there. Join me, GT is SeattleSk8
---
Yes, Mr gutsy is one of the best parts of fallout
---
Have you tried the asylum hats?
---
My God people are so entitled. The game isn't supposed to be about socialism and equality. You expect it because you frequent Reddit. If you don't get loot, better luck next time. Stop trying to control everything, and stop telling people how to play. 
---
And no. I can't one shot anything. I have a life, and still haven't reach level 50.
---
Lol please. No you wouldn't.
---
Or like a real fallout game would be cool too.
---
i want to meet that child and shake their hand. 
---
in my head cannon i‘m not from Vault 76, but actually from the Witcher dimension. 
---
don‘t know if you‘ve ever played it, but there‘s this character called „Cirilla“ and she has those abilities to travel between space and time. she‘ll probably make a cameo in the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 (god i can‘t wait). 
---
anyway, that‘s my character. she warped into post-apocalyptic West Virginia sometime before the events of Witcher 3 and she despises most Vault Dwellers. of course she has some considerate, kind but also badass friends, but most Dwellers are just fucking annoying. like they‘re glued to their Power Armor or something, and Ciri just can‘t relate at all.
---
I have but it's not the look I'm going for although it does look good with the unclean version of the space suit
---
Finally, a suggestion that doesn’t suck.
---
No, I don't want none of you damn muties coming in to my store and bringing your damn radworms with you.  You think you're so great flying through the air with your abnormally large leg muscles that let you jump higher than any normal human should.  We're here to rebuild America, greatest land out there, not become science experiments.  If you are going to come into MY store, you damn be sure to clean yourself off.
---
I have never been able to hear anyone in voice chat since day one..
---
What you said
---
&gt; As it is now, the only thing you’re going to do is draw the support of other people with the same tantrum issues, instead of affecting change on those who need it, making the game better for you and everyone else.
---
Or people who can look past his lack of social skills and look at what he's saying rather than how he's saying it.
---
I'd rather they nerfed bloodied, stealth, VATS and melee strength damage bonuses, and then buffed all the base damage values. Won't happen though. 
---
Until then, just play bloodied if you want to deal more damage. I switched when they buffed the hell out of the SBQ a couple of patches back.
---
The only one I've heard of it happening to (Limited to PC players) is the scraping of the Marine Armour Helmet (Not hood) giving you the ability to then craft. Outside that 1 example, Never heard of personally experienced it.
---
Vendors. Farm something easy to find and buy it.
---
Check chat volume in settings. Mine defaults to 0 every time i log on ps4.
---
They almost had it... yesterday there was only 1 picture daily
---
Aka the Scooby Doo Scam....
---
No rush. My tag is SapphyChu
---
Send me a message when your on
---
Damn dude
---
I do not believe outfit plans can be obtained from scrapping- I've not been able to but I have found plans for certain outfits in the world like the underarmors and the witch outfit and hat and the skeleton costume and of course the civil war outfits and the ski outfit but none of the others. 
---
Scrapping only really applied to armor / weapon mod plans I believe except certain things like combat helmets and metal helmets and the sentry bot and eyebot helmets I believe i learned from scrapping military circuit boards?
---
I get 5-10 mins in game now after the most recent patch and then it crashes, seemingly at random. Sucks because I was just getting back into the game.
---
That's just an all around great spot for farming steel and possibly plastic depending on what weapons they use. If i get legendaries in the mix? Big plus but i never set my expectations high for legendaries there.
---
And they’re still closed for renovations. But yes, o love it too!
---
Survival mode would be fun if we got a chance to survive a bit longer...
---
I loved those type of books as a kid...upvote!
---
Ew
---
This one appeared upstairs in my house. I could hear it hitting something but kept circling the place but couldn't see anything. It wasn't until it put the wall through I realised where it was lol.
---
Yeah. Was afraid of that.
---
Detrimental gameplay bugs over the course of the game; radio silence   
---
Random lighting error that no one noticed; 7.7gig update   
---
Great work team!
---
Damn I thought about that too but didn't knew what to drop for it.
---
Thanks everyone.
---
Thank you!   I’ve been wondering what’s been going on.  Recently did a pvp challenge within my group and this bug broke my strategy.
---
Delete your char evertime you die and start a new one lol😂
---
I do, all the way up
---
That's why I do it... not that I'm a vendor... but you come in my camp.. ya getting a shower.. dont want you dirty mutie stank trail in my house... no sir ... hahaha
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
If your on xbox I'm farming high level super mutants for legendary gear. I have no problem letting you tag along and get a few hits on them before I kill them. I do this a little bit each day and level up 2-3 times and I'm level 127.
---
idk. i have 2 accounts, since i heard about the vendor i stash everything
---
true. but i´m not alone
---
I'm actually in the same boat when it comes with Explosive weapons.  I always figured I must be spec'ed wrong for them because while they do a bit more damage, they have never been god-tier for me since the nerf.
---
Welding helmet.
---
that is also not fair
---
My bloodied can one shot them on chems and bock. Dense chest and 1 rank in fireproof will make you invincible to the scream. They nerfed them a little while ago, they used to scream all the time. It was almost funny you couldn't see them to ads and take the shots. Wall off white hitting your face.
---
Ha! Yes, or give orders or, even more hilariously, bicker with the other hosts! Vendor Bot Wallace and Rose would certainly not like him, because he is basically the last remnants of the government. Plus we could hear Vendor Bot Wallace’s soothing voice.
---
That's very unfortunate because I slay those sheepsquatches with my BE Gatling Plasma and i still get drops after turning them into a goo pile. Maybe for now you can just slay them down and then swap to a ranged weapon and finish them off so they don't turn into a good pile? Idk..
---
Thanks.  Will give that a shot.
---
Temporarily.
---
It is random... but i had one last night where 2 ‘squatch came after us. One dropped a legendary, the primary had all the normal loot but no legendary, not even a drill! :(
---
Its what I've started to do, sometimes theirs loot, but its a like 50/50% chance if I goo something their will be nothing to loot...
---
Yea i dont like being a sitting duck while trying to quickly select something. Nervousness sets in and i can get bum rushed at anytime while looking for said item
---
they already have no worth anymore
---
Can't you people form your own opinions?
---
"I like this game, but am I allowed to?"
---
I can imagine.
---
Bad news for myself is that I'm a melee build
---
Thanks, fixed it. I see them every day but can never remember what they're called. Folks have seen them on the PC, think it's an item that came from the dev room and is up in the air? I'm not sure. But yes, the tactical helmets that look like a ninja mask
---
This. I hit one and immediately sprint to the other side and hit the other, and for good measure sprint back and hit the first again. Since adopting this strategy I haven’t had an issue with it.
---
It's difficult to kill scorchbeasts when they just fly a mile in the sky and irradiate everything
---
One of the best suggestions I've seen.

I asked for [Raider PA locations previously](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/at6kga/datamine_closer_look_at_the_plague_rider/). Between all the locations in the responses i was able to get a full level set no server hopping needed.
---
I use the social menu as its faster. And its worked for my Responder Vendor hunting.
---
Can't believe no one noticed the file size on the original 9.5 update was way too big before the update went live.
---
\*Invites people to event....doesn't tell them how to get there\*
---
Sounds about right.
---
There's not a lot that goes well with the space suit outfit aside from the space suit helmet - tho perhaps the wrapped cap + surgical mask or the white gas mask might work? although the wrapped cap just looks silly to me but it's one of the only white helmets I can think of - there is the flight helmet but it really doesn't match anything in the game - you can wear it with a bomber jacket but that's not the look you're going for D:
---
Maybe grab the Arktos Lab Coat from the new event (or you can find a normal lab coat in a box in the tugboat at Gorge Junkyard)  + Surgical mask instead?
---
Yeah, you screwed up by picking up the frame. Not sure how long they take to reset, but may be as much as 24 hours.
---
There's raider PA in the arena at Pleasant Valley, and one of the sheds outside Blackwater Mine. Usually max-level, I think.
---
Dang, sorry thats all i got.
---
&gt;Random lighting error
---
read that however you  wish, I very much doubt this patch has anything much to do with lighting
---
u/druglisted
---
Bobby-B, are you there?
---
All good man
---
Lol yeah I already have my right, center, head and arm ‘lefts’ lol.  Thanks, I take it by the username you are West Coast?  I’m usually on later at night pacific time
---
Country Roads 10 hour loop
---
Are you seriously flaming people for trying to make good builds?
---
Lets say you get your way.....you can play your 8 hours a day and rack up tons of legendary items. Bethesda says sure spend it all on scrip. So you cash it all in and get all of the weapons you want in the game.
---
What now? What do you do with your 8 hours?
---
Good idea, but, i would rather not have them mention when people claim a workshop, cuz a level 200+ dick will wait untill you wasted all your resources on the workshop, only to run in with their bigass ego and destroy a lvl 20 because "he needs it more".
---
Yes this is a personal experience😂
---
Also if you are one of those lvl 200+ dicks, get your ass out of here and go play rust, you belong there
---
Also i want Travis, the awkward one!
---
How many shots does it take you to down a sheepsquatch? I've got an instigating hunting rifle and a two shot and it still takes ages.
---
Not a bad idea but sounds a bit cumbersome. I think a good first step in the right direction would be to allow players to make a playlist from all the songs currently in game
---
Brilliant idea.
---
Its in PC. And scrapping one gives you the ability to build it yourself. I bought one via player vending and now sell it in my own vendor.
---
Did you get this fixed?
---
you get it later. use the fermenter in the nukashine bar. the plans are rewards for finishing it
---
So don't walk through it? Jesus. People are so needy on here.
---
Or three
---
Figured, the armor was there for the first 2 hops and disappeared entirely for the next 8 or 10.
---
I was considering trying something similar with turning all the power plants and associated power boxes on. I think there's 22 of them plus the three power plants.
---
Time to get a second hobby!
---
This, I consider it a success if I get the vendor to below 50.
---
Good ideas.  I'm looking for the wrapped cap but I stupidly picked up a hat that was in the spawn location so I have to wait.  I didn't know there was a white gas mask.  This could be what I'm looking for as I was thinking something like the Firebreathers Helmet but colors don't match.  Is there a spawn location for the white gas mask?
---
I thought I saw weird exterior lighting.
---
kudos ... will go out to eat while it is downloading.
---
Yeah I thought for a starter as well that i lost money. 
---
But now I keep clean track of my stash for sale and it has actually worked correctly every time for me at least. Tho with the wrong number showing
---
I'd be happy if they'd just inject some songs from the other games, since they're reusing a lot of other things from older games.
---
So how would I get into their camp?
---
You can get the white gas mask off the mannequin that is standing in the room with the robot raider vendor inside the ski resort at the top of the world resort. There is also one in the lockers at the fire department at whitesprings.
---
At best, you'd be able to make your own playlist of songs that exist in the game now. They simply do not have the legal right to add songs from previous games to this one.  Rights granted to a song in one game does not carry over to another game.  I mean, just take a look at what happened with "The Wanderer" Song from Fallout 4
---
i don‘t get it
---
I personally love it. I buy valuable items that I find under priced, and flip them in my own machines. Flipped 2 guns recently for 50k. I paid 15k. Took all of 15 minutes to re-sell them. But otoh, I don't care if someone is massively over priced either. To each their own. If it's worth it and they can get it, fine. If not, then I guess it'll just sit there and take up space. Supply and demand.
---
 read the patch notes.
---
See I think enemies like the sheepsquatch and SBQ are just boring. We stand there and shoot into this thing for 15-30 minutes at a time. Oh, it landed, yay. Oh, it pivoted. There is a laser, crazy.
---
See, it's not interesting. The incentive may be (the drops), but the enemies (bullet sponges) are boring, repetitive, and time consuming. Give me the thrill of being surrounded by 50 ghouls at once and having to battle out of being entrapped - that is a fun fight.
---
Sorry. Inadvertently posted the same question twice. 
---
Have deleted the other one.
---
The French people could be considered a race.
---
OK. Thanks. I'd read about bugs with ammo selling for sometimes nothing despite a 1c price, and thought I had finally experienced this. Kind of relieved.
---
that mister handy was funnier. Fo3 was funnier in many instances. just remember Moira after she turns into a ghoul, lol. 
---
i have yet to come across something as memorable in Fo76
---
one of the vaults around the area opens up.. bam there's your NPC's
---
Go back to the speakeasy. There is a note you have to read first before you can use the fermenter right above it.  Everything you need is right in the speakeasy itself.
---
Lol more nonsense. The update isn't even actually 8gb. 
---
Does anything that gets posted here actually have basis in reality? Or is this a tongue-in-cheek sub?
---
No it doesn't.
---
i have already what i need but still...you will never have enough
---
NO &gt;:( It's been nearly 8 months, time to take a shower &gt;:( /s
---
The act of collecting someone else's dropped loot for the first lets say 5 minutes after it was dropped could be a hostile act that flags you for combat. That wouldn't need to count towards something someone purposely dropped, but rather their death bags.
---
Not scrapping doesn't stop your junk from dropping.  The game just drops everything that is in your 'Junk' tab regardless of status.
---
Ha! Yes. Love that! I feel like MODUS could cover nukes, but I can see Rose covering Encryptid like a sports game. 
---
“And that Vault Dweller is now...supercharged with LIGHTNING!?! And the fancy Assaultron just killed five people! Five points for the robots! See, I was right you Brotherhood idiots, fancy power armor is useless! USE SOME PSYCHO AND STIMPAKS YOU IDIOTS...unless you LIKE being ripped to shreds by combat robots. Hey, I don’t judge, unless I don’t like you!”

[c4vetteman94](https://www.reddit.com/user/c4vetteman94/) want to sell any dups?
---
The dataminers haven't found any evidence of luck playing a factor in any drops, purveyor or not. Luck only effects weapon/armor condition.
---
same happens to me, i turn it off cause im on discord and i use the same mouse button for push to talk, i turn it back on and they can hear me, but their icon pops up but no sound on my end

So how big is it? Why won't the laptop download it?

You're welcome for the money I spent buying this haircut, video game company, you got me again 🖕🏼.
---
I'm a shotgun build, always been my favorite weapons in the series. So I feel your pain. I use a shotgun and a sledge.  
---
I have a few rifles, Blackpowder to open combat with a sneak attack, and a Combat Rifle to chip at Scorchbeasts so they land, and hit things I can't reach with a shotgun.  
---
It gets a lot more manageable with power armor. Negates a LOT of the damage the scorchbeasts do.
---
Just real life luck as far as I can tell
---
Only to push a false narrative.
---
I was about to post this \^\^ There's one guaranteed spawn in that open bunker on a table. Trap bases bring in a lot too. I dunno why but people tend to run around with lots of fiber. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vo4fWSNcxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vo4fWSNcxs)
---
I’m sure that adding actual speaking humans wouldn’t be an issue to Bethesda. You can get quests and stuff from robots and that’s pretty much the same thing, just a different character model. 
---
I think the problem is the whole dialogue tree thing, and how it would work in multiplayer. Even if that isn’t the issue, I’m sure Bethesda have a solid reason not to put in human npcs
---
Don’t get me wrong, it’d be awesome, but I’m sure they have their reasons.
---
That makes less sense than left left.. so u have torso, helmet, and I'm guessing right leg? Are u meaning to type leg instead of left?? So u need right arm and left leg?? I have no idea what your trying to say. As for the username, no I'm on mountain time, just shoot me a message whenever you get on
---
If you don't want a passive mode, then why not play Survival?
---
You can loot them if the turrets kill them. You just don't get the XP. I loot stuff my turrets kill all the time.
---
Nice thanks!
---
This is correct.  Despite the name, it blocks this damage all the time and doesn't require you to physically block.
---
you don´t know what a gamer means
---
It still is. Ran through it this morning after someone nuked it. Flora doesn’t change though, never did
---
There's no fucking rule that says you have to enter everyone's camp. That is literally a choice only you can make. The world isn't always rewarding. Sometimes you have to risk it. You may actually lose some radiation poisoning. I know that's tough to handle. But you have to weigh your options, buddy. 
---
Stop. Telling. People. What. To. Do.
---
Have leveled intel almost exclusively so far
---
Correct. He does comment on launches if you speak to the command terminal. My favorite is when he asks if it was you or if the communists were “...up to their old tricks again.”
---
Out of everything its the only thing that pisses me off about this game
---
Yeah, I switched to an Instigating about a month ago, haven't looked back.  Had one that sat in my stash for a while too.
---
Bad luck, this happened to me a while back
---
Im guessing they had to replace the entire last update file which was ~8GBs
---
1)  Its not your loot.  You die, you drop your junk, now its the server's junk.  
---
2)  You can do something about it.  Either don't die, or pick up the loot bag first.
---
3)  If you do not want it to be in passive mode, then you know the solution is to head over to the PvP mode.
---
I feel like it was a much needed but way to heavy of a nerf
---
That’s why they spawn tons of other enemies around you when the queen lands. Mostly it’s just garbage ai (probably bugged in someway) that stops a lot of the stuff from being all that fun. Poor pathfinding really kills the threat for me
---
Ah
---
Sorry I didn't mean to imply you didn't know.. lol. Mainly just working it out in my head how that's possible.
---
So.. how do you do that? lol.
---
Its always gonna have a limit to it either way to keep the market from being flooded by 3* weapons I'm imagine if you could pump out as many 3* as you wanted no one would be buying or trading guns.
---
Ha! Yes. I can see Rose doing that since she’s already amoral and twisted.
---
Urgh it’d be helpful if you listed your platform and ingame handle otherwise what’s the point of the post?
---
Not gonna get rid of Rod Howard that easy.
---
*cough* Ghost Riders In The Sky *cough*
---
Just saying, my .50 cal machine gun cranks out way more damage than any automatic handmade and weighs less while doing so. It's not a power thing, it's a broken system.
---
Like Glastonbury but without the mud and stormzy
---
I knew this would happen, as the reading level around here seems to be stuck at the introduction to letters level. 
---
I don't think there should be separate modes unless one is ACTUALLY passive, and one actually isn't. Right now, they're the same mode, except you're unable to defend yourself from the stupid acts of others on one of them.
---
no I made it up
---

It would be awesome to have a proper radio dlc where you could build a small station and create a custom playlist (of songs that Bethesda have a license to) and also talk via mic, and allow players in the general proximity to listen in.
---
I keep mine inside my first floor of my CAMP, at the foot of the stairs going up into my private second floor living space.  I'm fine if someone buying from my vending machines, or coming inside to use the work benches on the first floor, but I'll be damned if I'm letting any filthy mutie up into my living room and bedroom.

Erm... what? The brotherhood was formed by Roger Maxson at the Mariposa military base a couple of days before the bombs went off. They executed all of the scientists working on the FEV, sealed up the base and made there way the broken hills.

Just opening a vault seems lazy and boring to me. It just produces more vault dwellers that dont have the same character that someone that survived outside a vault would have (like all the people we hear about in game, but never see.)
---
Switching weapons breaks stealth for a moment.
---
Please consider making an actual build instead of relying on crazy OP weapons as a crutch.

Pretty much every weapon in this game is viable in the end-game with the proper build. Even rolling pins.

THIS!

Uhm - I've been able to reloot those basketballs and kickballs just by server hopping?

Sorry, comedic failure on my part.  I think lack of sleep from staying up all night playing Fallout is making me punchy.  Yes, I meant to type ‘left leg’ the first time and tried to lean into it for humor attempts.  I need a right arm and left LEG.  For clarity’s sake 😁
---
One of us.. one of us.. one of us..
---
Ah, ad hominem, well perhaps you should actually use correct game terminology as well.  No one can steal your loot from an event.  They can leech off the event, or do things in the event that mess it up, but you are still going to to get your loot when the event ends if it's successful.  
---
The only "loot" that can be "stolen" is that if you die you drop your junk and people can pick it up.  So perhaps the issue is you're using the wrong game terminology. 
---
Perhaps you should provide an example since your so apt at writing out such clear concise examples and providing such a detailed solution.
---
Just try it, take the leap
---
OK that would explain it then, I need to equip my rifle before I approach the target. Thanks I'll try that.

Medical goggles and a gas mask together, they clip into each other a little but look like a combined helmet. Dont know if theyre supposed to be worn together but worked for me last week atleast. Pair those with the Science scribe uniform  and you got a good looking character.

---
900hrs in and I love it now more than ever. For me it’s a no brainer, get it! It’s a game to get used to, not one to rush to some non existent end game. If you like fallout, exploring, looting, crafting, and don’t mind some performance bugs, this games is for you. It’s not a polished AAA experience but it’s got this charm about it that is missing from anything else in my massive collection. And the psychology of it all is amazing. Hard to explain, I’m a psych major and have found little ways to manipulate other into making it an improved and interesting experience for me. Could make a while post just about that aspect but won’t do it here. Bottom line, get it and try it out for yourself!
---
Exactly this. This will never be a true market, as well- many players end up with a lot of things, rather incidentally, that have value to other players but not themselves. They didn’t “work” for it. This doesn’t really happen to any significant degree in the real world. 
---
Ammo for melee players, lots of stims (I have about 500 stimpacks stuffed on a mule, and I’ve vendored thousands), weapons for different spec than the player uses, etc. 
---
In the real world, supply usually means work. Here, for a lot of things, it doesn’t. They just magically appear and we pick them up, from chests, from bodies, whatever.
---
Seems I've been missing this one then, thanks for that, I'll equip earlier and stay very very still :)
---
They added a skyrim DLC
---
I don't do events with items in my junk for this very reason. ( I love doing the imposter Sheepsquatch event you always see someone there just for the brown bags)
---
thank you :)
---
Well, they did the same thing with Elder Scrolls Online and slowly turned it into “Tamriel Unlimited” with a full overhaul of the entire game. I could see the same thing happening to Fallout 76.
---
Is this PC only? Raider Dave, the chaotic neutral flaming sword wielding wasteland wanderer doesn’t like being called Kevin Stuff as much as I do

I do want the threat. That's the problem. Survival mode is a trainwreck. Adventure mode is basically forced cucking. I didn't say it was "stolen." And based on, well pretty much every thread ever posted on here, it's not just me. There are 4,024 "PSAs" on here everyday asking people not to one shot things. That's stupid. People can do what they want. But if that's the freedom we're granted in Adventure mode, we should have the freedom to kill those people who step in at the last second. Otherwise, it's designed to punish you. Some of you are into that, all well and good. Some are not.

While “Wild Appalachia” has set the path to improving the game, I hope Wastelanders will completely change the game for the better. I wonder how they’re going to add the “choice and consequences” aspect of it, still hoping to have dialogue options back.

So I never get loot/XP from scorchbeasts (not just the queen but any SB) and I realized the game tracks how many SBs it thinks you've killed...my tracker says one. Even though I've killed four in the last week.

Also I killed one on a team for that weekly event last week and my teammate got the gun/credit and I didn't.

Sort of. The invisible part only works when motionless but it seems that chameleon armor grants some sort of bonus to your sneak skill all the time. With five pieces of chameleon gear you're essentially undetectable and can walk circles around enemies while sneaking without being seen.
---
That's why I have the most fun farming, low level enemies makes for good fun. I'm not having any fun spending 100 rounds for a mid level enemy. Plus I think they did something to the power armor, it doesn't protect as well.

---
On PC here, i cant hear them but they can hear me.  Blows balls
---
Doesn't make it any less true.
---
The awkward moment when you look at your profile and see that 90% of your comments are complete fucking drivel.
---
Paintball gun?
---
sounds like the base texture for bullet holes
---
You are taking this way too seriously bud.
---
I know what healthy means lol. I've been an all dater before. Then I realized, while it was fun, the rest of my life suffered
---
This is how I help with the SBQ as a rifleman. I just use concentrated fire on a wing and keep criting it with enforcer on.
---
Sending you a request!
---
Are you seeing the enemy type/name in the top right when you look through the camera view finder? You have to wait for it to register the name before you take the picture for it to count. I know i got Wolf on mine. I'm only missing the Cat picture.
---
I did Archery, Athletics, and Hunter.
---
Code Breaker is also doable but requires launching a Nuke (something i haven't done yet).
---
Improper semicolon usage? Ja Rule wouldn't be very proud of you...
---
Damn, i’m on xbox. Oh well. I hope this event goes well for you. You should post about it here

my friend got 2 possum medals first try

I actually expected this to be a pic of the suicide [handgun.](https://news.guns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/suicide-pistol-660x426.jpg)
---
I just dress like a [barbarian](https://imgur.com/a/rglgyBx) most of the time with Wildman Outfit and Antlers when daily isn't forcing me into a clown suit or a dress. I like tribal themed stuff.
---
AA/STR/Power ATK damage Deathclaw. I took my backpack off because it's not a Mothman or Megasloth backpack.
---
*I would enjoy a Weightless Trapper set with AGI/RAD resist and Harder to Detect but they're impossible to find in my 700\~ hours.*
---
There's actually a map on here of his entire route to find him on c: or you can check here / LFG for posts as people like me often post when we find him to help people out - I noticed this especially so when that was a daily~
---
Yup. Don't get people getting mad about it. If you don't like it, you're free to run yours as you wish. Pretty simple. I gave a free serum to a random guy the other night, because he'd accidentally lost all of his mutations. I could've easily charged few hundred caps for it. As a matter of fact he offered and I declined. But I also have a serum recipe in my vending machine for 8k, and I'm not ashamed to list it as that. I received zero recipes after umpteen hundred sbq event completions, so I considered myself lucky to be able to buy them when I did stumble acrossed them. Even if it was for 7.5k. I guess what I'm saying is that just because you're trying to make bank doesn't make you a heartless bastard, and just because you give doesn't make you a threat to the "economy". Just play that game the way you enjoy it, and don't fret what anyone else thinks.
---
Link doesn't work for me man...
---
The TSE nerf happened the day before I got my TSE gauss, so I never noticed. With enough perks, Chems, and food, I’m up to 650 dmg. I can only imagine what pre nerf would have been.
---
There is a "filter" option when selecting perks that will show up after you click on which special, on the bottom of the screen. On PC/Keyboard, it's the z/c keys which toggle which perks are shown by special, then mixed, then by level(?)(Some cards require multiple points to initiate, like Lone Wanderer). If you are just scrolling through, you might easily bump the key. That said, for many builds, it is NECESSARY to do this in order to optimize a level 1-50 build to enable selection of "post 50" perks that actually function. (Requires a good bit of planning actually). Also, in previous patches, they did add the ability to MOVE a special point after level 50 instead of selecting a new perk at each level up. So you will be able to "fix" if you need to...
---
Surgical mask and welding coggles also make a great combo but i cant figure out what helmet would match with the engineer uniform
---
I know it’s not in 76 but happened with the wanderer
---
&gt;I didn't say it was "stolen."
---
from your title: 
---
&gt;The paradox of not being able to attack others, but them still being able to **steal** your loot
---
Emphasis mine, you did say steal, it was in the title.... 
---
So what is YOUR solution, you're still just bitching. How is killing those players afterwards going to do anything? You think that if you just turn on those players after they get their legendaries they aren't going to just one shot you after?
---
I was being harassed by a level 10 at Whitesprings Station who was wearing Chameleon Set Armor, while his three buddies crouched stealthier waiting for me to engage the level 10. I just stood there and went AFK for a few minutes while using the Legendary Scrapping Machine.
---
When I came back, I was still being repeatedly shot at.
---
So, I ignored him and went to my stash, retrieved an Orbital Strike Beacon and tossed it at the level 10, and logged off before the strike hit.
---
Yes!! The radio is so underutilized and has so much potential for giving server alerts and promote new content and features or even atom shop sales
---
Up on the hill southwest of the water park...a flatwoods monster and red eyed mothman spawned right there when i discoved the lemonade stand
---
That makes sense!
---
No, just a little letter sign out there "No Mutants Allowed"
---
FERAL GHOULS, NED! ON AN OPEN FIELD!
---
Yeah, I am not blaming them.  I get it.  But if we're on the subject, they left out quite a bit.
---
At least we have Charleston.  I live fairly close to there.  I also grew up near the Gorge bridge.  Went to Camden Park many times.  Beckley was nearby as well.  So I really can't complain too much.
---
My current town produced nitroglycerin for World War 1.  Some of the old explosives factories are still standing.  I would've liked to see us included, but oh well.  Can't have everything.
---
Toxic goo is my best friend. :)
---
Sadly my gaming rig has been retired. Gonna build a new one once I can get enough together. I’m on Xbox atm.
---
I found a new one as well recently on the road by whitesprings - it was like a army recruiter bot that directed me to camp mcclintock (even tho i've already completed that quest) pretty funny tho!
---
Bad rng/luck, I had two 3* last time I did it
---
Hell of a shot!
---
haha close enough &lt;3
---
Man that almost looks like a painting.
---
I still think its stupid that near by team mates don't get even partial XP if they don't tag something you kill. Drops should also be determined by proximity to what has been killed in relation to the player, not if you hit it or not which I always found incredibly stupid. (gives me a reason to send other players team invites right as an event starts at least)
---
Should implement something like....
---
Beyond 100M of teammate killing something you didn't tag = 25% XP, no drops
---
Within 100M of teammate killing something you didn't tag = 50% XP + drops
---
Within 50M of teammates killing something you didn't tag = 75% XP + drops
---
Beyond 100M of someone not in your group killing something you didn't tag = nothing
---
Within 100M of someone not in your group killing something you didn't tag = 50% chance for drops
---
Within 50M of someone not in your group killing something you didn't tag = 100% chance for drops
---
Within 50M of someone not in your group killing something you didn't tag, and you haven't damaged something in the past 30 seconds = nothing
---
Yea I've seen the names while I've taken their picture.
---
Man you are right that would have fit right in - could have even been like an explosives workshop you could take over! But yeah it's hard to fit everything in I guess D:
---
Glad to hear I wasn’t the only experiencing this!
---
it's funny how everyone has just completely given up on the idea of ever having actual people in this game.
---
It's the abstract modernist paintings that grind my gears the most. I love them and they are even featured on the white springs shop walls. It's almost like they just forgot.
---
Same.  I don't use those rounds, so might as well make something off them.  If we could recycle rounds I'd never sell any and just break them down and remake them into 45.
---
Are you in an non-english language country? no being a dick, just saying that a couple posts have shown a language translation problem so it's probably that.
---
Face down booty up that's the way we like to buck
---
I might just have to switch over to Archer badge and do that
---
I think it's plenty...
---
Grafton monster sludge paints the area of impact white
---
I’m glad it did! It’s part of the reason I asked the question to the community, actually.
---
I dont see why we would need a dialogue wheel for this, like you've said, it works for the robots.
---
Lightmaps can get pretty fucking huge. 
---
I'm not saying they *have* to be huge... but they can get that way.
---
If youre not a Power armor user i suggest going with gauntlet melee weapons since they only require 3 ranks of iron fist and deal pretty good dmg, frees up a some space for other perks such as blocker and other weight reduction perks.
---
Sometimes a legendary will group inside other mobs I’m punching and I’ll try to avoid them but they’re suicidal man so sometimes they get hit before I can react cause I’m also not going to let the monsters kill me because the other players aren’t paying attention. We just need a Sorry emote.
---
You want more chances for it to register the Leader of the Pack event near the Fair Grounds is perfect for it. Tons of Wolves. You can also take a picture of their corpse they dont have to be alive for it to register.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Valued contribution. Gold star
---
Yeah.. it was working fine for me a few days ago.. now I've crashed about ten times in a row. Whatever they did broke it..
---
You want real life in game? We should sweat more and use more water for wearing clothes then. Half your food should be used up when fast traveling. We should catch more diseases when just walking around in the wilderness. We should bleed more heath after taking damage unless we use bandages. There are so many other things that could be fixed or new content that could be added but Bethesda is being tasked with tackling all these random requests from players that complain about minor inconvenience game mechanics. What the hell happened to playing games the way the devs programmed them?
---
I would if you were tradeable.
---
It was a Gamma Gun.
---
TL;DR Bethesda please make the game easier.
---
Admittadly I was a scumbag raider in my youth, since reformed, mostly...
---
On xbox. My Mic randomly cuts out when I get close to 3 or more people at the same time.
---
Hardest part for me was Repair 3 Crossbows. Every one i crafted was 150 Durability (level 5 gunsmith) i really didnt want to put that many bolts through one to repair it so i just waited until i found 3 in the world and repaired those.
---
Same thing happens to me now all the time. try putting a few seconds in between each click. That seemed to work for me.
---
Lol, all joking aside that was actually a fear of mine. I left due to the toxic environment and ridiculous bugs. Since I came back everything has worked a lot better. I began to think, I bet the jerks will return as well.
---
Read the context.
---
Out of the hundreds of times I have run it I have never had all the supervisors be non-legendary
---
Cool man.
---
There is the support beam under Stairs.
---
Must of been thought they may of added something fun for pipe rifles or something.
---
It's okay. Mormonism is a tough gig.
---
It's like Skyrim but with guns.
---
It also has the same amount of bugs as Skyrim.
---
I agree!
---
Roses are red,
---
Violets are blue,
---
I didn't water them,
---
They died
---
Not sure about Biv. He's fine in small doses but constantly hearing him on the radio would get obnoxious pretty quickly.
---
I'm in 1 piece chameleon and 4 unyielding so kind of expected to not be as invisible with full chameleon, it was just the slight movement of equipping a rifle alerted everything that I was curious about.
---
I've decided then to go for a full on legendary chameleon search, I never trade or buy from dodgy places so may take awhile, but I like a challenge.
---
Cheers.
---
you need to build your perks around them. perks and right mutations and they;ll hit in the 900+ power range
---
Dont focus on armor at all until level 50. Don't repair it if its not a 2-3* legendary, just wait to get new one, they will drop and repair is expensive when you start. Scrap all you can as you learn mods. Enemies are stupid and if you cheese em smartly you can ignore levels. There's added thrill of being level 20 put against group of level 60 mutants and knowing its one of those times where you simply have to run. Run sneaking, if thats possible. Sneak a lot, its great both PvE and PvP, worthy tip is that building around sneak will pretty much always be effective. I recommend high luck on your first character, and 8 intelligence so you could easily craft anything you please. Melee is very efficient in PvE and commonly considered OP, but its a shooter and melee shoots bad. Its an easy choice for big power early, and a wasted choice for endgame, if you dont spec for big guns. Mutations are super fun and by 31 get two cards of starched genes perk so you have control over them. Use trading markets on reddit, fb or discord for best deals. Dont allow yourself to store more than 200 and wood steel in your stash if you don't plan extreme construction efforts as your next action. Many quests give missles as rewards, drop them, they are heavy as fuck. Use Nukesanddragons to get a glimpse of your planned build and to learn what cards are out there.
---
This I believe is all you need to know not to be hindered in your explorations. All the rest will be enjoyable to learn at your own pace, so just go with the flow.
---
That’s funny, because I got back into the game because my wife and I were trying to find a chill gaming environment that wasn’t some massive MMO.
---
I think if they had factions and friendly fire was off for factions, we'd only need survival. People would feel safe with most pve.
---
Chicken doesn’t work either
---
Yeah I totally get that and understand, the game isn't perfect and that can happen. I mean stuff like say Uranium Fever or Free Range or AWOL Armaments where the legendary/ies are often by themselves not in a pack.
---
You raise a good point though, sometimes they are in a pack and it's nigh impossible to distinguish them from the other enemies.
---
Reminds me of the trailer. The guy in T51b that sees the nuke.
---
You can repair the same crossbow 3 times. Take off Gunsmith, craft crossbow, bash some enemies, repair, bash more, repair, bash more, repair, done.
---
Gotta keep those missionaries workin my man
---
The option to speed up the process is in the actual room with the robot. It's a 1 time use thing for the mission.
---
How have I not heard of Filthy Casuals until now?
---
People are down-voting and saying your comment is off topic, but it isn't in the big picture sense.  Getting rid of the leaderboard is simply one more way to make Survival easier so you can reap all the rewards while minimizing the risk as much as possible.
---
I was looking for something a little smaller. They also kinda hang off the side half way
---
But overall not a terrible idea, perhaps I'll fall back on them if I can't find anything else
---
the blue white powder jumpsuit?
---
Nah, unfortunately it’s automated gates and security.
---
And plastic!
---
Should have removed your clothes!
---
Stealing for background purposes
---
Like a blue green color? Is at White Powder? Goes with the Arktos theme well.
---
Ah good point, i though Gunsmith was needed to make one.
---
It's all the same.  Getting rid of leaderboards is just another way to make Survival mode even easier.
---
just don't lock your things or they can pick it to become wanted
---
Its a video game, not a simulation. Weapon weights were decided on as a function of game mechanic. Not to mimic real life.  No.
---
Unless it has TS and Explosive I wouldn't waste my time. Players exploited the game and this was the solution.
---
On like the first day of player vending, I found somebody selling bird bone serums for 200 caps each.  In my excitement of finding such cheap serums, I bought like ten of them, thinking I could easily make a profit.  Jokes on me.  I've had these priced just so I won't take a hit, and I still can't get rid of the damn things.  Never stopped to think if anyone would actually want bird bones.
---
yeah i don‘t think it‘s that AT ALL, if anything, we are becoming more free every day. TV shows that couldn‘t be on 10 years ago are very successful today breaking certain „taboos“.
---
it‘s just that bethesda likes to dumb shit down so really EVERYONE can appreciate it. they couldn‘t ruin Fo1 and 2 legacy in any worse way, but whatever. this is the best proof, some people honestly like the jokes hat beth provides in the f76 perk cades. whatever floats your boat i guess
---
sounds like a cool boss though still. The wendigo in the wendigo cave should have a cool appearance like that seeing as it's implied to be that raider boss.
---
This dude is all over in the watoga area for me
---
Sell you on it? Take a gamble like the rest of us and form your own opinion. Not trying to be rude but this comes up every single hour on this sub. Just get it already and find out, it’s dirt cheap on amazon
---
Hmm, time to get my farm on lol
---
I suppose another tip for everyone would be to find the boss and if its ghouls try and destroy one of its legs so it can't move so you can freely kite everything else that spawns near it away to farm indefinitely.
---
Is this since 9.5? I got Chicken and Wolf both in mine but it was on 9.0.
---
Except it is the CAMP/workshop plan colour and not the weapon/mod colour.
---
Yeah, this happened to me on the Tuesday patch.  It wasn't really asking for a 61gb download, but it wanted 61gb free space to do the 8.5gb download.  I have the game installed on a 120gb SSD with 15gb free space.
---
Anyways, since there is no way for me to free up 61gb without moving to a bigger SSD, I just uninstall FO76 and download the whole 61gb game again.  Today it didn't ask for the 61gb free space and downloaded fine, must be because I reinstalled on Tuesday.
---
This also happened to me during the Beta and some early patches, but  not for quite a while so I thought they had fixed it.
---
I met him a couple days ago on the ash heap.  
---
Started out like the “repair me” one (that rewards you), then voice change and name changed to Mr thief.  
---
Killed it before it had a chance to steal anything from me,
---
I got skunked on taking pictures for a badge too.. 
---
there are several I tried to get that didnt register
---
the swimming pics worked fine.. I dunno why
---
I know it can’t be but I know it exists.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
It's almost always level 50+ area now. I managed it around level 35 and after 50 it's a breeze but before then you're gonna get one shotted by ghouls
---
I’m on Xbox:((((( awful!
---
If anyone on Xbox has one, let me know
---
You broke into an dropped a house warming gift?
---
Upvoting
---
Creepy but upvoting
---
I'd probably drop White Knight in favor of max Sneak. If enemies can't find you they can't hit you to damage your armor. Then just equip it when repairing for the reduced cost.
---
I'd also take a few points out of Rifleman to max out Covert Operative. You'll get way more out of sneak attack damage than you're giving up in straight increases.
---
Well sure... But there are a TON of AKs manufactured in 5.56 now. Probably more so on the civilian front.
---
It has happened to me for a few patches and I run Windows 7.  It's a FO76 thing, not a Windows 10 thing.
---
Oh my friend did you ever see the giant like bloatfly in New Vegas it made a deathclaw look small.
---
Plus you know to some with Entomophobia it could be a nightmare.
---
Depending on how you're kitted out, it's a bit of luck and a bit of concentration.  It doesn't take a ridiculous setup, just a few good decisions.
---
I consider myself pretty underpowered for most things, but I can kill enough ghouls and super mutants, after that it's just going to the places where the legendaires hang out.  With luck, one run through WS.  With bad luck, a little server hopping or run WS and west tek a couple times.
---
Worst case, invest in a particular weapon that will make it easier. A ghoul slaying weapon, especially with instigating or explosive (whichever is more appropriate for your choice of weapon) is a bit of an investment, but it makes things easier.
---
I don't think the cap should be raised past 150, but it's not terribly hard to earn that much without a lot of time investment.
---
50 low level ghouls as in... how low? Would be boring to kill level 10 ghouls and no reward.
---
I run an auto build. The AA gun does make a difference in PvP and PvE. I also can farm up Crits real fast and use Vats all the time. The AP refresh Armor I have certainly helps.
---
We're kinda low key, but all are welcome!  ;\^)
---
I got one now, but thanks for the offer.
---
Wow I'd actually 10/10 would fight level 90 zeppelin sized 3* legendary. Huge monsters as an event would be rad.
---
Even though I don't play bloodied, I actually kind of hate it when people visit my camp and don't turn the shower back off.
---
Same here, for the same purpose of crafting those helmets daily. And yes they do sometimes respawn by server hopping, sometimes not. I just assumed it was because someone else already looted them
---
I feel like when you die in adventure with Passive on you shouldn't drop anything. If you do, it should make you wanted for caps or something. I don't understand the premise of this. You have 24 people who lived in a vault together and now they want to steal each other's shit and PVP.
---
Right? It did take up most the cave.
---
Thanks for the workaround it worked and I can progress now so thanks a lot.
---
I got the impression it's intended to have a humorous bent to it, in which case the traditional dramatic Fallout intro is rather counterproductive. But that's just my impression.
---
The people who don't shut doors are just as annoying.
---
Another one.
---
Exactly what I was saying. Thank you!
---
Same here.
---
There’s a reason WHY asshats won’t PvP in survival 
---
It was never about improving their PvP skills
---
It was to assert power over lowbies.
---
Damn Shame Reddit won’t let us provide GTs
---
Have had that happen a lot. Just never had 0 legendaries
---
I saw this last night. Nukes campfire tales, covered Poseidon. Would have gone but I was on my alt.
---
Yeah, ofc it makes a difference, depending on the mob it's anywhere from a 15% to 30% increase in damage, making it pretty average as far as legendaries go.
---
Was thankful me and my squad was able to do the flatwoods monster challenge last night. How? You need to stop fast traveling so much. They made fun of me because I picked up a crapload of stuff from Encryptid and had to crawl my way to whitespring. On the way I saw a purple glow on the top of a cliff. Sure enough, Flatwoods Monster. Took him down and called the rest of the group to come for pics. We initiated pvp with each other so it marked us as in combat and the challenge completed just fine with the dead body. If I hadn't have been overencumbered and walked to WS, I would never have seen it as it was off the beaten path.
---
I will say, that should have been a weekly challenge and should have given more than 10 atoms. Dailies should be quick and aimed at getting you to places on the map you aren't likely to go on your own. Help spice things up a bit. Weeklys should be challenging and/or long and slightly grindy.
---
Well, if you've got a choice between a \*\*\* Bloodied junk junk for 3k+, or a \* Bloodied for 500, it makes sense, especially for an experimental build or alt. Not every purchase is for big boss end game, and not everyone will pay a lot to dick about the wasteland :)
---
Fair points.
---
However maybe I was lucky until now, but i had nothing but cool time with that event. and i never saw it fails, or being frustrating.
---
That being said, boss (in general) needs some really better mechanic. I don't know if it's possible because, the game is not really designed for team support (like the usual trinity: heal tank dps) . Everybody is alone in a team (even if there are some benefit).
---
I'm on PC, I just about have a bloodied version of every weapon, even a Fatman lol
---
I had a .308 rifle for sale but I think someone bought it already. Once I got a bloodied gauss I stopped using it. I don't have a bloodied lever action, but between a bloodied handmade, bloodied gauss, blooded combat shotgun, and bloodied gognok axe I'm covered
---
Yeah my biggest problem outside of being targeting for basically just staying alive and playing is that you don't even get anything for being high up on the leaderboard. (Oh you have a survival score of over 40K, here have fun having this 4 man squad follow you to the nearest Train Station and attempt to kill you repeatedly for the 3rd time in an hour)
---
Sometimes I look for PvP, but its getting so cheap, basically just a battle of who can OHK the other person first at this point its not even enjoyable. Especially with BS like MKIII Stealth Boy spam and Tesla cheese.
---
has anyone tried this and can confirm if it works? if so please also mention platform..
---
um wtf is the point if camp will only produce 1 water/5 min when the thing says 60/hr
---
The download is 7.73 GB, but for some reason the Bethesda Launcher asks for 61 GB free space....sometimes.
---
I finally spotted a mothman from a distance the other night and took him down in a single shot to keep him from flying away. His body bugged out and dropped into a rock cliff face. Wasn't able to loot and was so mad. That was not my night.
---
Pretty sure it was a paintball gun. This happened at my camp last night too
---
Is that a new thing?
---
Have you considered the team medic perk  route?
---
You’d be the belle of the ball at events like SBQ and Sasquatch maybe even the new paradise
---
Are you PC? I'd make a good offer on that metal arm if it also has assassins
---
Very Rare drop from doing events [More info on the Rare Jumpsuits](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanic_jumpsuit_\(Fallout_76\)). Same things as the fire hat [Link](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Responder_fireman_uniform).
---
Yes. My "false narrative" of that discriminating people is unacceptable in the modern world.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
---
At least they're fixing it - the crash bug is still there on Xbox (not sure for other platforms) and many people cannot access the new content at all as the work arounds are not working for everyone. Complaining about them fixing a bug, what a child.
---
I hope we can make a grinder eventually. That we can break down ammo
---
It works!
---
If a griefer wants to grief, they can easily figure it out. Withholding spawn mats isnt preventing it. That's all I'm saying. If they wanted to prevent it, they'd spawn people just outside of the buildable area.
---
Then maybe it's a windows in general thing.
---
I think there would be a lot more posts if it was a FO76 thing. I've run into it in other situations, but never with my FO76 installs. 
---
most likely PICNIC
---
No I'm on PS4 plus I would never sell that because it's a good piece.
---
You're a special kind of special :).
---
that's legit. take my upvote
---
According to the other posts about today's update it is in regards to a lighting issue.
---
I think the leader boards are mostly ok. However, the idea of showing your marker and having it tied to ranking is idiotic.  They just need to implement a large yellow circle on the map that shows the general location of players. Now whether they do that for being high ranking or for everyone on the server, is up for debate.
---
I believe they need to have a pvp area in survival that people can show up to.  Maybe an event where you can earn rewards for participating.  Something that has different modes and gives you pre-assigned weapons and gear.
---
especially mod plans, what effects does the mod have?
---
It seems like the marker for friendly animals cuts off only a few feet away.
---
What chems did you take? I want that!
---
This is fantastic!
---
Sell to vendors they are worth 300 to 400 apiece
---
I hadn’t just because I usually prefer to play solo, but with as many perk points as I have waiting to be used (~20) I’m now thinking about it as an option so I can have a better way of giving back in team events. I really wouldn’t even try to join up with others if it weren’t for the fact that they’re giving out items that I really like from a building perspective, etc. Right now I really want the Stimpack diffuser so maybe I need to use my points on team medic and vats options.
---
I need that person writing the script for WBIV, the radio station by Biv. Pirate radio type thing
---
Disagree. This mode is for PVP hence the restrictions removed. You might as well say survival is now PVE 2.0.... Survival is dead because there is no reward for PVPing... a few measly caps isnt worth it.
---
Ya must be talking about the Cryolator! Lol!
---
The servers are still super unstable, especially around certain events like Arktos Pharma.
---
feels bad man
---
It shoots snowballs
---
Wow. Just... wow...
---
I have some great weapons. I make runs through WS but that yields maybe 4-5 legendary drops which are usually one star drops. West-Tek isn’t really worth it for the two legendarys I see when I go through there. MY luck is decently high. I just don’t get more than 10-13 legendary drops a night and that usually equates to 50-60 scrip. I've gotten 100 a few days but that's one roll for a 3 star ranged.
---
now you just have to be in the green circle and hit the button to enter workshop to contest an already claimed workshop
---
I can confirm that I was able to change my display name, but I have not yet confirmed that the new display name shows up in game.
---
Agreed, that is the false narrative you tried to put in place.
---
I don't know for sure since I can't craft .44 ultra cite ammo. I guess I need to find the plans for a .44 prime (assuming it even exists) and then see if the Tinkers bench unlocks .44 ultra cite for me.....and then see if the combat rifle that identifies as .44 really can use .44....
---
No. Fuck your bloodied meta
---
8GB update? That was a surprise to me too
---
How about instead of just making the game easier, you plan your build before you start your character...
---
Agh my heart. As if knowing the white fire helmet is a 1 outa 35 drop(if its even an apperal drop) didnt make me sad enough... Bethesda needs to throw a dog a bone every now and again if they want us to keep us trying for sweet lootski
---
Already found atleat 10 times. I sell the lemonade/hard lemonade for double price, still an instant sell.
---
But in the summer, we will make hard lemos for sure :)
---
I hope you're able to find out what it is because I might have just found me a new hobby
---
Favorite:  Scenery and hidden messages/scenarios in said scenery.  i.e., a skeleton I found in a rocking chair overlooking a beautiful vista with an empty case of beer bottles next to them...  neat.
---
Least favorite: Random crashes without being able to return to last server.  Sucks when you see that blue PS4 screen are you've powered up a plant top pump out some fusion cores.
---
A few months ago, I used to keep a spreadsheet of all legendary drops for purposes like this. The last entry was february 3, but if it helps, I had 4 drills, flare guns, and syringers out of 119 recorded drops. 
---
Also got some pics of 3* disappointment: [1](https://imgur.com/YxhE1Q5), [2](https://imgur.com/TQA7neL), and [3](https://imgur.com/QluW6lO) (literally yesterday)
---
Literally no one wants a br mode
---
I think the faction machines would be great. Join a faction and complete quests.  Get a faction outfit, plans, decorations, etc.
---
Great idea. Upvote sir
---
Just happened to me at the Camp Fire event!
---
Gone through the waves, gathered the kindking and missing items, dude shows up and one-shots the legendary at the end!!
---
What a f\*\*\*\*\*g HERO!!!
---
Great shots. :)
---
Yeah i'm playing the 19% version. Thanks for the output mate !
---
There are some items going around that are likely from the Dev Room or just very very rare (or a glitched drop). Acid Soaker, Nuka Blaster, and Paintball Gun.
---
Is that a nuke?!?!?
---
The toilets seats and sooking stove doors have always bugged me. I'm a survivor, not a slob
---
that‘s not what i was complaining about, but obviously you didn‘t really read my comment. 
---
i‘m complaining that of all the employees apparently no one checked the patch before releasing it, which then resulted in another 9GB patch today. what i am complaining about is the fact that I HAVE TO PAY for so much bandwith, not that they‘re fixing the game. 
---
this sub is so biased, fucking christ. 
---
you can‘t do shit except posting a thousand „Dear Bethesda“ posts every day, as if they gave a single shit. lmao. if they did, they‘d implemented more of the mods we made for Fallout 4, because they made the game fun. but noooooooo, they‘d rather steal mods and sell them for profit. 
---
at least someone‘s complaining. if nobody complained when the game launched, you would still be playing the shitshow that it was. be glad it‘s better now, but don‘t tell other people they can‘t complain. 
---
and no, you‘re the child.
---
Huh, I never really thought of that.  Genius!
---
following the OP 0-10 scale Id go with an 8 for content I think..
---
probably more like a 6 for execution...
---
Yeah, I heard some weird sounding gunfire inside Pleasant Valley Station while I was scrapping legendaries. I went inside and there were white splatters all over the wall. I'm on PC. Does look like a paintball gun. Wondering if it was looted from the dev room or something.
---
Right -someone brought a 8 year old into the party and he followed all of us and now he just sends constant minecraft invites - had to block him
---
Thank you!
---
Honestly dude....adventure mode is for infants who don't want any game conflict, survival mode is for children who want to play for petty caps and still have their bases invulnerable. We don't need any more shitty nerfs plz stop.  
---
Still waiting for a mode for adults who are willing to defend their bases and their caps( You know... the premise behind all fallout games) . smh @ these noobs Its a nuclear wasteland ffs, go install sims 4.
---
I managed to get the plan from the event somehow.
---
It heals you and farts out healing gas in a much too small radius around you.
---
In a game where people are constantly moving  (especially if they've taken enough damage to need healing) it's not great.
---
So I'm just selling them cheap at my vendor for people to get the badge (thankfully the challenge is use diffusers rather than make them)
---
I can confirm, and I had no idea they were located in Austin?!
---
So I've been intrigued by this from the beginning. Do you think once you complete everything you'll just get some secret rewards? I'm really hoping for a squirrel hat and maybe something else special
---
cool well let us know and also inform us of platform plz and thx
---
It definitely sounded different from any gun with the same look almost identical to a modded pipegun with rifle mods.
---
Same here. It's quite heavy for a lighting file, but who knows...Perhaps some hidden bug fixes? That'd be nice.
---
lol
---
Actually, I do not think it was even promised that "all" content will be playable solo, since in [this Game Informer article](https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/09/04/the-new-wasteland-what-to-expect-from-fallout-76) from before release it is specifically said that events often cannot be completed solo, they are designed for groups. More likely the "you can play it solo" statement refers to story and side quests (the kind of content you can expect in a single player game), but not events and challenges.
---
They actually have done a good job in segregating griefers, but I agree that if this is why they are withholding spawn mats then they are causing more accidental grief than other gamers might do on purpose.
---
And the occasional well done trap might be funny.
---
Is there any trick to knowing where people spawn outside of just sitting on your porch waiting for it to happen?
---
5/7
---
If you’ve already learned a plan/recipe it will have (known) in the title and it will be at the top of the list.
---
Scrapping helmets that are part of armor sets (metal helmet, combat helmet, dev room marine combat helmet) will teach you to make them. Other than that, I don't think any other clothing gives you plans for scrapping
---
Well there’s no harm in upping your charisma and luck stats with food and chems on the off chance that luck and/or charisma increases your chance of a rarer drop, you’ve nothing to lose really, I get good drops and bad ones even with high luck and charisma due to unyielding armour so who knows
---
Pipe revolvers benefit from both pistol and rifle perks, so with all of those stacked and combined with the right mutations and other perks that thing would wreck face.
---
Are you sure it wasn't a Nightkin killing the brahmin? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It's a great sidearm, especially if you already have a Bloodied build. I wouldn't focus a build around it though.
---
I haven't really measured my strength, but I think Im okay
---
Ah well in that case I think I maybe saw a plasma with a beam splitter, thanks man!
---
This ^
---
I want a tiny deathclaw. I think he would be to tiny to hurt me.
---
we are doing 10-15 queens a day. are also encrypted, hoard  event and random encounters
---
Level 45\* Vampyre Buzz Blade (electrified giggles).  I can stand in on just about everything except ghouls (due to the rad damage).
---
I had an AAE one of those. What a beautiful weapon! I love them!
---
I don't always max it out, but if I go to the trouble of farming, I can usually get 100 in a matter of 30 minutes on average.
---
Luck (the stat) has nothing to do with anything here.
---
Server hop for fresh runs, but if you get on a server that seems to drop legendaries (even 1 star) all over the place, stick it out and hit a few areas.
---
With a decent weapon, you can clear out the golf club in 5 minutes.  West Tek (I rarely do inside) is similar, but takes a little better weapon.  If you can handle ghouls ok add the burrows to your rotation.
---
Awesome, thanks for the update, finally got to change mine
---
I do have adrenal reaction and some nice Bloodied weapons I'm stacked in that regard. Time to start moving some cards around.
---
the market is already fucked and full of duped items
---
5. Lone Wanderer and Travel Agent.
---
Game is still the same, after you completed all. No endgame, just grinding. Boring, and no new big content will be released soon. You can go back to play other games, don't waste time for now
---
Weird lighting gets a 7+GB hotfix, but users CTD using an elevator doesn't? Interesting priorities.
---
I think it may have been glitched initially.
---
If you haven't played in a few days that's patch 9.5, which includes the new event at Arktos Pharma and a bunch of misc bug fixes.
---
PSA: display name can only be changed once every three months. Should've put more thought into mine...
---
Nice!  I'd be happy if I could just get the camera
---
I wish
---
Get your Charisma to 20 and use Hard Bargain 3 and sell them for 500 each to the vendor. Easy money.
---
While I agree the SBQ is just outright dull and spongy as *fuck*, I've had some good fights against Sheepsquatches. Mind you, despite being level 200+ I'm not one of those meta-bloody-tse-max-dps builds. I just pick out what's fun and feels right at the time. Had a fight that had the Sheepsquatch chasing me around a ruined house while I frantically threw mines over my shoulder and blasted away with my shotgun whenever it rammed me.
---
6/10 on paper 4/10 in execution
---
You'd get reported and banned. Think it's worth it?
---
Aw man, those screenshots hurt to look at... and what happened to your spreadsheet? Still have it?
---
&gt; buttfucking at habitat A
---
ouch
---
Use the thumbs up emote after taking the pic next time
---
Oh man this would be great.  Name the Mr Gutsy three arm. Haha.
---
I doubt there are any bug fixes as console would also get the update but that would be nice. always nice to get bug fixes.
---
So our character’s display name isn’t the default?  Step in the right direction at least!
---
Maybe a 6/10
---
Besides the backpacks and brewing, it didn't add much in the way of new things. And brewing is really just glorified food crafting combined with waiting.
---
More events, more enemies, more clothing options and decorations, more recipes, etc. Even as great as the Purveyor is, it's just a way to cut some time out if a grind.
---
It's a great first expansion though, because it shows just what the devs can do.
---
The best stuff would be new perks, new armor, new mods for existing items and stuff like that. And some solid story stuff, not just one off quest lines.
---
This was our Operation:Anchorage. Now we need a Broken Steel.
---
Why do people think things are all or nothing.
---
I see many suggestions asking for game mechanics to be changed in specific circumstances, then people reply 'but that would change it everywhere'. What? No.
---
I've had someone contest like twice in 600 hours of playing. It's so rare. And is that really the end of the world? I've usually won the contest...
---
I saw someone yesterday giving away free ammo, and I thought it was genius. I'm going to start doing that, I'm in the Forest so I see a lot of lower level characters, and they love 10mm and .38 rounds. Gonna start just giving them away.
---
Ammo recycling is already in the game files. It's not implemented.
---
Yeah thanks beth for the 3 hours download to fix some lighting...
---
You're on your way. And moving stuff around takes time. Overall it wasn't a bad set up, just a few things and you'll be 1 shotting shit in no time!
---
That may take a while.  My current Charisma is 4.  I did just get Hard Bargain 3 this morning though, so I'm on the right path!
---
I got to update again even though i downloaded 9.5 2 days ago.
---
I was just thinking the other night that it would be cool to tune into a radio station that did that, keeping me informed of events as they happen(with captions too).  Want to make money off it?  Throw voice packs in the Atom Shop; I'd buy them.
---
oh man...that quest...lol
---
..and the ability to inspect Legendary Weapons and Armor regardless of if the camp owner is there or out wandering Appalachia.
---
Happens to us too. I’ve been playing with two Xbox’s since my GF went out of town (for empath and a easy bank character) but the mic works just fine on my Xbox and account but area chat doesn’t work for her. 
---
It’s strange
---
I’m not trying to say it’s a simulation. I’m trying to say that it’s a quality of life improvement that is Rifle users need. It’s not fair that heavy weapons characters have weight reduction perks and we don’t, it’s not fair that pistols characters can carry around tons of guns whereas we can only carry a few. It’s a big inconvenience to Rifle Users that should be addressed.
---
Please please hold onto it I've been looking for one of those since the game came out, my main weapon in fallout 4 was the TS PR and I've loved it ever since 4 came out. I'll pay 30k if you hold onto it until I find out wether this fasnacht mask some guy is selling me is a deal. You'd be doing me a HUGE favor!!
---
Nice, appreciate it! I haven’t had to farm steel in a bit as I farmed about 1k a while ago &amp; have been good since but I’m down to 60 so I need to get back on it!
---
Yeah Biv’s voice just gives me the heeby jeeby’s lmao dude creeps me out
---
Seriously, they're a bunch of bullshit.  I've stopped looking at them at all even, since they're usually such crap they're not worth doing.  Think about it, that picture of a player in a space suit fighting an alien?  That's worth what?  $0.20?  Two fucking dimes? 
---
  
---
Pass.
---
I have heard from a dataminer that (fake) rad resist is actually disease resist mislabeled
---
Yeah the radscorpion one wasn't bad. Jump a few servers, but grahm was so situational. The alien can be done though.
---
That would be awesome!!
---
Store the Brahmin replace it then you can milk it again.
---
This is an amazing idea.
---
I know you're joking, but yes, I saw the gun flash and the player used the thumbs up emote afterwards to add insult to injury. Wait, was it you????
---
I mean, sure it's only 1 steel and 1 razorgrain to replace, but I don't want this to become the new routine every time I come back to camp.
---
You can resurrect him with commands
---
I'm redownloading on ps4. Can anyone tell me if the party invites have been fixed have been trying to find an answer for about an hour and can't seem to get a solid awnser.
---
Nothing is more annoying than capturing the power plants and stuff only to have friends jump and and having to leave to join a party. Really ruined the experience.
---
On my Xbox, headset doesn't even register unless I turn the controller off, then plug the headset in and turn the controller on.
---
If I turn controller on first, then plug in my headset, Xbox says network settings are blocking my chat... Restarting the controller fixes it for me.
---
I doubt they would implement that system - way too easy to abuse.   (think Instigating .50 hunting rifles or Furious Miniguns).
---
7/10
---
I had no ideal about any of this I just picked cards that made sense, this is my single and only character. I don't want to start all over. It gives me something to look forward to. I'm already doing some massive damage, but now I'm going to optimize this build. Next 3-4 levels I'm moving Strength points into Luck, AGI, and INT. My carry weight is currently 365 base health. I'm also testing my Bolstering/Unyielding to see which would be better for me.
---
6/10 seems about right.
---
I carry a gamma gun, just shoot yourself in the toes for 30 rads per blast
---
I have a ton of 5mm for sale at a cap each, and its way over priced at that price.  I wish I could sell it for two for one cap or something.  Nobody who's needing 5mm is going to buy 2000 rounds for 2000 caps.
---
I server hopped at the Giant Teapot for hours. Picnic tables by the parking lot. 👍
---
what system?
---
Xbox lol
---
Shoot yourself in the feet with a gamma gun for 30 rads per blast, that’s what I do
---
It was just weird to me.  I saw one, then turned around and it was gone, then I couldn't find any of them.  I'll do the event again this weekend, hopefully I'll be able to catch it from the beginning.
---
I have gotten (and currently wear) a Leg Scout armor piece....
---
i have a mod to sell or i can mod it for you on xbox but i wont be on till around 10pm  central time
---
I didn't bother reading your edit.
---
"Someone else being an asshole is your problem, not theirs" is an argument from someone I'm not going to bother with.
---
Could be more non cosmetic micro transactions, despite the promises they made
---
Do you want to play the game with me? My psn username is orcaman20206
---
Even something as simple as "Ridiculously Spongy for ballistic but vulnerable to energy, melee, or radiation.". In rotation of course.  Would make you carry multiple weapons and ammo, or find groups.
---
I think the reason there aren't more posts is because most people have plenty of free space.  I've seen a few posts about it, and it has always been people like me who have enough free space for the download, but not much extra.    
---
The error isn't a windows notification, it's a message in the Bethesda Launcher.   It recognized my 13gb free space, but said it needed 61gb.
---
I farmed it from level 9, if you build your base somewhat close you can still draw them out and shoot from rooftops.
---
I have experience in speaking with someone about this. It's a very accurate statement. Also some folks use vendor bot prices and not player market prices, as they are not familiar with the sub reddits.
---
I think you missed the entire point of his post.
---
I mean meeting people to organize events. My husband and I would like to join up with people. We're on PS4 though.
---
Best idea ever!!
---
Yep, that's the way to go. Can one-shot all the Mr. Gutsys with sneak bonus.
---
I'm pretty sure you have access to google.
---
Yeah i know thats why i hope they read it because - no offense - but there seems an bigger issue oft the translation rather than a lightning issue. At least what you read.
---
Birdbones is awesome, but I already have it lol
---
Assuming you're on PC:
---
"Hi everyone,
---
We’re planning to release an update for the PC version of Fallout 76 today, May 24, to address an issue affecting an exterior lighting file. This will not require downtime, but PC players will need to download the update.
---
We used an incorrect lighting file when we released Patch 9.5 for PC earlier this week, and today’s update will address this by applying the file we had originally intended to implement. Unfortunately, this is not a small file, and PC players who have already installed Patch 9.5 will receive a download size of approximately 8.5 GB today.
---
However, as a result of this update, PC players who had not yet applied Patch 9.5 will have a much smaller download size once they do update to the latest version of the game.
---
Console versions of Fallout 76 are unaffected by this issue and console players who have installed Patch 9.5 will not need to download anything. Additionally, we are not making any gameplay changes, which means there will be no patch notes for this update.
---
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause for those of you who had already downloaded Patch 9.5 on PC."
---
&gt; Randomly dropped rewards suck 
---
Literally dropped rewards really suck when someone shoots the Alpha's corpse through a wall and off the world with a rapid explosive weapon and no one gets it's loot.
---
I didn't have too much of an issue with "bullet sponge" boss, and it gives me a reason to use Chems. Killing it has never been an issue, it has always died relatively fast every encounter I've done. I just dislike the pet dying so easily. Defending a dumb AI is frustrating in any video game. It's pathing is extremely random and it strays so far from it's spawn and into other biomes with no control over it. 
---
Filling all 3 biomes is near impossible and not made easier with more players outside of Venison. I can fill Venison faster solo than 6 people can fill the other two because those don't seem to generate more items with more people and aren't shared among players.
---
this is gold. repost it everywhere to make visible
---
Is that legit? Either way, I had to explain a very real lol to a coworker...
---
This is an app for Fallout 76 (for iOS) it doesn’t allow things that are directly linked with the game or your character (since Bethesda doesn’t have an API for that to be possible) but it includes guides, an Atomic Shop where you can see most of the items available there, an interactive map, and many other things. Also, if you contribute to the app, since its crowd sourced, you earn atoms which can be redeemed once you’ve earned 500 atoms.
---
Have a look at it:
---
Survival Guide For Fallout 76 https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/survival-guide-for-fallout-76/id1394272520?mt=8
---
I know, I know, kind of rude, but I wanted to make sure that nobody else took it before the owner got home.
---
"It's me again, Mr. New Vegas, reminding you that you're nobody 'til somebody loves you. And that somebody is me. I love you."
---
Yeah, sure i'll send you a request
---
Hey! Think you could hold it for me? I won’t be on for a few days. But I’ll toss you a few K to wait:))))
---
I also started running into Mr Veterinarians that has a conga line of kitties behind him. Too bad it was by WestTek and the Super mutant Suicider wiped them all off the face of Virginia :(
---
Is that a guaranteed spawn? I was considering building there for the junk pile.
---
ever since they took away the explosive mod from legendary energy weapons ballistics became so much better. Unless something drastic happens, ballistics will always be better
---
PC?
---
they nerfed caps everywhere else, what do you guys expect, you wanted baby mode adventure, baby mode survival, now workshops is the best place to hunt players for caps and even then its barely worth it. but yes lets nerf this too so we can just all move to another game
---
Thought they fixed that already?
---
The change is made from your account settings at Bethesda.net. Do the consoles use a Bethesda.net account? If they do, then it ought to work, but if not then you’d have to see if this option was made available for whatever the consoles use for account settings I suppose.
---
Oh man, so take this idea (which is genius) and pair it with a cryolator, so he can't move around as fast.
---
sure i can hold it for you GT is Tanaas just send me an xbox msg whenever you are ready and maybe one now so i know who you are
---
I did the same thing awhile back. How do you deal with the super mutants that spawn inside?
---
It’s likely PC only but I’ll dig around myself. Thank you!
---
You’re the best! You’ve made me so happy!
---
If they can add content no one asked for that introduces a whole nee host of bust every month then they can take a second to make something player DO want that cant add another new duplication method.
---
Actively avoiding gaining experience points to avoid getting killed is the way to play right now. You shouldn't be punished for playing the game as intended.
---
I never told you to do this first of all, but what I said was bash the enemy, let others tag it and kill it. If you see others in uranium fever and you just one hit all the legendaries when you could just bash one instead that's up to you. I'm simply explaining how you can keep your build, weapon, fucking everything you want so bad and let others have something at the same time
---
Bethesda said approx 8.5gb
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/344578/pc-fallout-76-update-may-24-2019?language=en
---
My pc downloading it now says its 7.73gb.
---
You gonna berate me with climate change statistics and call me a infant and belittle me?
---
Rifles have the own strengths. You'll make them overpowered if you make them any better. Rifle builds are a big majority of builds. People wouldn't be using them if they sucked... There are many more rifle builds than heavy guns builds. I can definitely tell you that much.
---
No. You should not be attacked after completing. But their tags will still appear red.
---
Would probably help if they put out some actual good content too and patched their broken spagetti code.
---
I had this problem with super mutants. If you tame a creature and make it stay inside, the spawns stop.
---
Its a repeatable quest so come back later.
---
It's pretty chill until you get addicted to possum badges and can't stop farming the objectives. I just need one more man, just one more badge. I will do really degrading things for the Unstoppables issues 1-4 right now.
---
Odd. It’s working for me. It’s a knowledge base article, text is as follows:
---
———
---
HOW DO I CHANGE MY BETHESDA.NET USERNAME?
---
You are not able to change your Login Username, however, you can change your Display Name. You can only change this once every per three month period. To change your display name, visit the "Account Management Page" and select "Edit Account."
---
And then there’s a screenshot of the new management page.
---
Lol. Timing I guess. It's honestly a role of the dice if your post will catch on.
---
Please no. I hate that guy.
---
Install the free new terminal it will tell you when the quest is ready
---
I have it since it came out and retryed every following day and it never worked
---
Down voted like a boss when nobody understands your statement is geared towards the future and not this particular event. 😂
---
I'm not gonna lie I would've killed him because I hate when people do shit like that
---
Some of them still randomly attack for no reason.
---
If it's a Mr. Gutsy...they WILL attack you regardless of mayor for a day completed or not.
---
They wont diverge into that direction as it would break what they currently have completely. I see no chances for that to happen, hence I suggest a separate gamemode, which doesn't screw up people enjoying survival for what it is.
---
Petty?  That's not petty.  That's asserting dominance.
---
the game classifies the Gauss ammo as energy ammo with batteries included.
---
I loved the Lying Lowe questline and side quests. Most of the stuff was good, but not directly aimed at the higher level players. Will provide much more to do for new player coming in now. 
---
8/10.
---
They nerfed all the weapons so much, that the the meta now is a stick. Which only drops from the SBQ, so good luck punching her enough to get her to drop one. There's only one person in the game right now who managed to glitch kill the queen, and he duped like 20k sticks, but he's charging like $20 rl dollars, so only his best buds have sticks, and they're all raiders.
---
Good luck playing with no weapons, when his "raider" buddies do nothing but kill steal, because they can do massive stick damage, and the rest of us are just using dull rocks. Then they start beating us with the sticks (thank goodness for no slap dmg amiright???), and call us stickless trash.
---
So, if that sounds like fun to you, then you should join our S&amp;M roleplaying group, the "Stickless Wonders". We meet every Tuesday, but don't accept invites from some guy named Mo0kish, hei creeps even the wierdos out.
---
I don't want to set the woooorld on fiiire....
---
I think it is the overworld exterior lightmap.   Hopefully it fixes the random bits of flashing, or the purplish mid-distance terrain.
---
Yes and i hate it
---
Handmade
---
someone didn't read the patch notes from like 4 weeks ago
---
Sit kid
---
Try getting the quest to speak to the robot from the personal terminal
---
I logged 153 legendary loot drops off the same enemy who can go up to 3 stars, before losing interest in doing it anymore, I got:
---
153 Legendary items (incl would be drill/syringer if they dropped)
---
73 Armor
---
80 Weapons (out of those, 2 were drills)
---
(Due to the enemy sometimes dropping legendary items while not having a legendary nameplate, the drill syringer detection could be not perfect.)
---
This was patch 8-9, xbox.
---
If they fixed it they must have done it in the last patch. I have a build that exploits the machanic, and it was working as of a few days ago, but I haven't played with her since the last update.
---
This will happen constantly. Best to either plant some razorgrain near it to keep being able to repair it, or hide the Brahmin inside your camp behind a locked door or two
---
Your you're screwed if section is my main fear of happening. I like roleplaying whenever I play the game so I don't have ingame friends.
---
A character bank a the very least would help in this
---
50 ghouls dies so fast from a grenade launcher or a Fatman. It's fun to watch them hoard our tank and then sit back while he gets pelted with ghouls trampling each other and hear the wweeeeeeeeerrrzzzzzzzz BOOM 
---
+4698 xp.
---
What stick?
---
Yes I know but it should be ballistic since they’re just little metal balls and the rifle uses energy to propel the rounds.
---
The wastelands, should you set the nuke off or shouldn’t you. Let’s talk about that!
---
So game is still an imbalanced mess with no care from devs?
---
The fact that you have to pay for bandwith is not bethesda's fault? 
---
i'm not trying to kiss bethesda's ass in any way - they mess up all the time. every bug they fix there's a new one - but at least they're fixing one instead of just letting it go like the obnoxious lighting bug that's been on xbox for weeks with no change or the fact that melee + vats hardly works anymore - or half the time you hit something it does no damage 
---
but i do like that you point out "bethesda doesn't give a shit or read positive bethesda posts" if you don't think they read those then what makes you think they read your complaints? lol
---
So to add to the "Forced re-spawn at vault 76" sometimes it's "force re-spawn at team member" because vault 76 also does not show up. This happens about one time in ten when re-spawning. It's caused me to loose entire loads of junk if playing solo.
---
I'm not an idot. If they can make content that no one asked for and no one likes that introduces a whole slew of new bugevery month then they can spend the money to add something that players will actually enjoy. The micro transaction are here to stay regardless.
---
Yeah
---
For riflemen, Bloodied Lever are pretty much one shot. So are hunting rifles, but Lever fire faster and don't have near the limiting bolt and reload animations. Non-auto Combat Rifles also work for rifleman, but are generally 2-3 shot depending on other legendary mods on weapon, and have a limiting reload animation.
---
Yes. And that same patch also introduced all the faction vendors at Whitespring to overall make shopping for stuff easier. Now you can actually sell more high value stuff since it’s a shared pool (mutation serums mainly)
---
Not for free.
---
You would have to kill people to be first, so I doubt you’d care if you have to kill more people.

You have to play music before the event ends or you fail, but i've never not had waves of enemies spawn any way. Maybe play for a few seconds then get out.
---
Very fun idea :) I've seen requests in here for various DJ voice's on the radio before but I think this may be the first robot request I've seen!
---
Depending on how you can place it, possibly some of the light poles or the Fasnacht poles, maybe?
---
A perfect score?
---
I got an 8GB, couldn't find any patch logs.
---
Can she also not server hop without restarting the game?  I have that problem too.   I get the connection to server time out message.
---
Yeah, op. . . If you do not want it, I'd take Sgt_kane up on his offer. BE anything is worth quite a bit more, but his offer is far and above what I'd pay for any pipe weapon. But everyone has their wheelhouse/wants. I'd probably pay that or more for a BE Gatling Gun lol.
---
That location gets attacked constantly. I moved for that reason. It has scorched and super mutants that go through there and intersect at that area.
---
Hmm i have a wireless set
---
You should be able to see it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o8oVF7uWBfQzaOhg3Rs7WhONqn3YITu60xFWuqNsTSQ/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Yes! It’s so frustrating to do a daily and get 10 atoms when I spent most of my time online working for it. I guess that’s on me though. Haha 
---
Also - the amount of atoms we get for challenges over time.... you get 80 for scraping 76 shot guns but only 20 for having 7600 hours in the game?!? If I ever get there I’d hope I get more .
---
I think those are junk and can only be scrapped.
---
Singular workshop items that allow for multiple "furniture" crafting stations were possible for f4 (see Horizon). There is no reason to exclude it from f76. I can see it being a high tier recipe.
---
Despite having ten, I never drank one.  That's going to change once I get home.  I can't wait to see how my marsupial jumps go now!
---
Officer thats them, thats the Gluten Bandit.
---
I have a wireless set. Dont think there is a fix for me.
---
I'm sorry.... have you met BIV? Or Codsworth? Or the smily robot dude from FONV? Or any of the robots from the old world blues DLC? It's not at all out of the lore for robots to have personality.
---
Maybe they hacked one of the drones to drop a radio at the first CAMP it saw. :p
---
Spotify maybe, Hulu no.
---
Never had anyone actually try to do anything for a workshop they always just server hop
---
Their neck beards are glistening in the nuclear flash

Add me if you guys want more support. IGN: MikeHoncho
---
I rate it at daffodil. It's not quite a hydrangea, but much better than a dandelion.
---
Don’t listen to this guy, he’s only sort of right.
---
Everything has been brought down a notch. The previously best armor is still the best, just not as good. Same with the legendary prefixes on weapons, they’re still the best just not as out of line with everything else. Other than that, Melee is completely broken competitively due to VATS being almost useless for Melee players, so if you want to PvP with melee weapons, I wouldn’t waste your time. 
---
The best build is most definitely a pure rifle build, with VATS crits incorporated. If you want to be a really really big loser you’ll incorporate stealthboys into your build, but if you do that, expect everyone to not think you’re good, but instead a cheater.
---
Ah! It lets me build the camera but before I scrap it, I was wondering if the camera even is a tradeable/sellable item.
---
Honestly I want Spotify all the time and just wish the tv did something.
---
Doesnt have to be BIV.
---
It doesnt apear on the terminal the only quest on the terminal is al's alcohole quest
---
It's the paintball gun, I know someone that has it. A dev room item. I also saw a guy selling them for 12.5k but they are technically not allowed because of being from the dev room
---
3  - for hard bargain. Also nice to be able to put 1 pt in travel agent and have 2 flexible points for things like Tenderizer or w/e.
---
handmade rifle for rifleman and handmade rifle for commando
---
Honestly if they were to change this, what we get out of the purveyor would be trash and you’d be less likely to get something good.
---
Nah she can. It’s only area chat that just doesn’t seem to work on her account or Xbox. She’s never had any enforcement issues or anything either, which I have. 
---
She can join a party and have the mic work, just not in game
---
HE HAUNTS MY NIGHTMARES
---
Or you try to fast travel to your/another camp and you have to wait a solid two minutes before the game lets you.
---
Doesn't it already feel like that's all Bethesda is giving us is handy's?
---
Lol? That's not what I said at all. I just said that I'm mature enough to look past him being an asshole, not that it excuses him from being one. As for the edit, it was all useful and helpful info on how to help you deal damage. Lol talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Hope you can get over yourself and learn to socialize like a normal person.

Guys....stop. What, do you have stockholm syndrome? Jesus, its been 7 months already.

Lol.

I keep most of the good stuff either listed on my on my vendor store or on my person cause I'm using it :P

I love it. I feel like your head should be a little longer, but otherwise pretty darned good. :D

I look forward to your stories in the wasteland.

I saw someone who had somehow agroed a freindly, and they led it to another freindlies area.
---
I'm reading through all the replies in here, thanks for taking time to provide us with all this feedback, guys! We can tell how passionate you are about our game and appreciate all the support.
---
Yeah the tv is a letdown. Holotape films would be cool, so would being able to play your games on the tv.
---
I like the concept but that would require your playlist being on the host server and it doesnt seem practical.
---
Read one of the five thousand other posts of this type, the rest of the reddit, watch some fucking lets plays, and stop shit posting.
---
Prime .50 cal is definitely worth it, especially on SBQ. It's literally a 50% total damage boost.
---
Sorry but, . . . I couldn't help but lol at this. Just the picture in my head made me grin. Like some goofy cartoon. . . Sponge Bob annoying Squidward in some obscure way, if you will, lol.

---
I really love my Bloody Lever but if I need something a little quicker I use my non-auto handmade
---
The only one!
---
Handmade for short range and faster fire rate (with 20% health = 300+ dmg)
---
Lever Action for long range (with 20% health = 600+ dmg)
---
Dragon for Big guys (SB, Sheepsquatch)  (With 20% health = 2500+ dmg)
---
PS. all Bloodied Explosive ones.
---
I got that too. No clue what that is.
---
Like they nerf bloodied explosives again. Plasma is super powerful weapon right now with vats crit builds
---
Token rewards was hands down the coolest idea..once played a game all "events" gave their standard xp gold and possibly a event reward but you where always guaranteed a "token" depending on how many objectives succeeded and difficulty of mission...these "tokens" could be used for 100s of different things, (rotating themes cosmetic boxes, things that upgraded weapons damage, armors defense, or even traded in for common items, the Devs even allowed them to be traded and sold, it was clearly a meta currency, but bet your ass everyone showed up to every event)
---
Great scott
---
"YOU GON LEARN TODAY!" - that dude
---
Will it be an update to the photos or the actual purifier we thought we were purchasing? If it's the former I don't think that's good enough. It cost 300 atoms - that's the equivalent to five days worth of daily challenges - even worse for people who used real world money to purchase atoms to get it.
---
Still, that's awesome, thank you!
---
Only happened to me once. Scrapped, bulked and sold their cloth. I figure, if I can sell it, it's a gift, even if they shat the bed. Besides, look at these beds and tell me it's never happened before. 😄
---
That paired with goat legs, I can jump off the highest things and be just fine. It's come in real handy lately with people putting their vendor camps over cliffs with pit traps lol 
---
In general I like it because I also use Stranger in Numbers or whatever the perk is called, and can practically walk in the sky for quite a ways before starting to fall.
---
Ok. I didn't mean literally every single person however I've counted 2 comments against it including you so I'm going to say the majority would enjoy it.
---
Two players did the same thing.
---
None of the above comment is true LoL. But yes, it’s pretty unbalanced. For PVE w/o power armor, you may want to go for a bloodied build. It’s by far the highest damage output but more risky due to having to keep low health. The low health stuff is easy enough to manage with the right perks, especially if you’re not using melee weapons (but melee provide the highest damage output). I’d say get whatever bloodied weapons you can find, full unyielding armor, and you’ll be strong enough to solo a Sheepsquatch no problem
---
If that's the way you choose to interpret it, then no/maybe/yes.
---
Wow!! This is really great! I love the use of space. You should show these off in the [forums](https://bethesda.net/community/post/2138567) as well, there's a thread for CAMP images right now for the next edition of Around Appalachia!
---
The robot will heal it a bit between waves if you get the password from the engineers computer behind the locked door and enter it in ARIC-4.
---
No they should not attack you unless you attack them first. Even if you kill one - the robot next to it will not attack you.
---
So you just have him an item?
---
I see the cause of this problem.
---
Hit up the military outposts along the west edge of the bog, and then go to the Asylum. McClintock is too popular. It's almost always picked over. Asylum has just as many, they are just more spread out.

---
We're glad to have you back! :)
---
This could be a good improvement
---
If you are on PC I'd be delighted to buy some off you :)
---
The full run of a SBQ timer, not 5 minutes. Often you die multiple times in these events, especially if you're running a bloodied build.
---
That's how I felt during campfire tales, did it all alone and literally as the wendigo is spawning a level 200+ shows up and goes out of his way to find it behind the cabin and one shots it before I even see it. I was beyond pissed, like seriously dude?
---
Yeah I dropped the PA for him to apply the paint work he said he would do then once he got that he left the server, my fault for trusting a stranger I suppose.
---
Camo Paint is exclusive to Atom Shop so can't be shared between players. Sucks he did this to you though man that's proper shitty of him.
---
I like the 150 limit. I'd prefer legendary mods vs this RNG. But specific mods would cost 1000 scrips. Meaning it'd take a whole week just to get one mod. This would greatly increase the over all value of the legendary vendor without the trash legendaries that comprise 60%+ of the RNG. 
---
Or maybe even both? You want to continue to drop 50-100 scrip and hope for a RNGesus miracle, that's fine. But give us the option to commit long term for an optional piece rather than exchanging junk for more junk. Give us the opportunity for that legendary "of our dreams" that was advertised. Rant
---
Another thing is with you pistol build what kind? Do they have the explosive modifier if yes get the demolition expert perk to up explosive damage
---
You have to do the reconfiguring during the first part of the event when you're feeding the troughs.
---
Quick! Do the thumb thing to make sure you’re safe!
---
A mans gotta eat.
---
I'm done with wishful thinking.  Ethesda said it isnt happening so I'm just hoping for the next best thing.
---
You're a fine example of the type of person who thinks walking up to a person's junk bag at the end of a SBQ fight and stealing their flux  is acceptable. 
---
Or, in other words, the worst part of this fucking game.
---
I thought we weren't supposed to talk about the stick!
---
No. Go back to minefortdutygrounds.
---
Oh nice and don't worry the reformed raider party has my vote
---
If the quest marker is no longer active, try finishing the rest of the quests then it might be able to be repeated.
---
Suppose that's what happens when you trust everyone.. it's a shame there is players like that around
---
Now I feel like we all left the same Vault and are settling Appalachia.
---
The city robots, no. The Mr Gutsy robots that sometimes spawn is the outskirts of town will still rip you a new one because the work for the army and not for the city of Watoga.
---
Not that it isn't risky but I have done similar transactions with other players and it's always been fine. Usually it's with heads off market76 though so the karma system helps a lot.
---
Down voted so Bethesda doesn't nerd this.
---
I'm ready to team up.. UN 'slaedwon' on ps4..add me as a friend n turn on 'notify when friends are online'..see you in Appalachia..
---
Okay I will
---
Ah, makes sense. I guess I’ll Just make another camera and keep It just in case
---
Just trying to stick to the lore. If it has to be a robot it might as well be an entertaining one. Yall keep up the good work.
---
Dang. Only other thing that's fixed it for me is to do an actual power cycle of the Xbox.
---
1) forced reset: HOLD DOWN the power button until the Xbox shuts off. Wait 30 seconds and power back up.
---
2) manual reset: go into settings and do a full shutdown throw power. Wait for the lights to stop blinking. Wait 30 seconds and restart.
---
Hope you get it figured out.
---
Sorry you got duped OP. The camo paint is an atom shop item so he couldn’t have painted it and given it back anyway. If he would have painted it and dropped it, it would have scrapped the whole thing (or destroyed rather).
---
Report him, at least.
---
My cats were all inside my building in my camp so they just stayed where they were, but it tells me I have to purchase the deathclaw to place it
---
Anyone who defends people stealing from loot bags is, themselves, a soulless fucking thief.  Taking something from a junk bag that's there within a reasonable window (I say about half an hour...you land right as the nuke hits, you fight the queen, you should be able to safely grab your shit at the end of the fight), should flag you as wanted just like picking the lock on a junk extractor does.   
---
Unfortunately, the ratio of "soulless thieves who don't think they're doing anything wrong" to "people who are sick to fucking death of having their junk stolen" is off in favor of the soulless fucking thieves on this subreddit, and posts like yours (and comments like mine) get karma bombed. Which is ironic as fucking hell.
---
...and what would the consequences of dying be in the game, if I may ask?
---
your gonna be swimming in broken cameras. ive had to delete 20 of them so far
---
It probably will change when a new questline comes into place and you might be able to choose which time/questline to load into..
---
I'm paying that much because the pipe revolver means a lot to me, and I want one I can use every day just like I did since I got a TS one in fallout 4. It's my favorite gun of all time
---
Need a selfie stick mod for the camera.
---
Naah regular 10mm and one 10mm double shot but that one was bugged in vats.
---
Using the game as it's intended = petty?
---
Ok.
---
damn the speed her health goes down, only ever seen it drop faster maybe once
---
I think this may have been my problem.
---
This is my setup as well. When I team up with someone I switch to Tenderizer, Strange in Numbers and either Travel Agent or Inspirational.
---
This is very encouraging. I'm level 38 now, and still run screaming every time something above about level 22 heads my way. My aim is garbage, but VATS makes Fallout (and and/all of them) playable for me. It's encouraging to find that eventually I will figure this out!
---
I get it, lol. Thought I made that clear. I'm the same way with Gatling Guns. All good.
---
And then, mysteriously, ghoul slayer's gamma guns rise in popularity
---
Ya, they were all chanting "don't talk about the stick, or you'll get the stick", while they were stealing all our kills, and beatin' on us. But, you know what? 
---
Screw those guys! I won't be held hostage by their poorly veiled sexual innuendos and stick monopolies!
---
Did you pull your butt apart and stuff?
---
Well if you can try to get some explosive pistol maybe furious explosive for a pistol and get the demo perk and bloody mess if you dont have it
---
Whys that??
---
Xbox let's you run Spotify in the background while you play.
---
My son gets in my nerves by doing this, lol.
---
Even if I did just want to 'Google the answer,' how can I plan a build for a brand new game when no one knows all the various perks and abilities that are available?
---
Or get off when ur at a safe location. I get off at my camp only
---
The best PvP build may be a pure rifle build with a TSE laser rifle, but that's not the case for pve. I have a rifle build with both a prime Handmade and a prime lever action, full unyielding + AP regen armor, and I've fought SBQ multiple times on both him and my heavy gunner using a primed .50 cal. I can attest that even with VATS crits and sneak attacks on the rifleman character, and zero sneak attacks / crits on the heavy gunner, the heavy gunner still does far more dps. It's not even close.
---
Yeah no problem, I have a big crazy story about how I got it in fallout 4 too so it's one of those things I'll always remember and treasure
---
Maybe the real problem is some legendary enemies are too squishy.  
---
Legendary ghouls are actually really hard for me to not one shot.  Even trying to wing them on an arm or leg will often kill them if I forget to leave stealth and get a sneak attack in on accident.  Same for legendary scorched and prolly a few other enemy types I can't think of off the top of my head.  
---
I get it for sub lvl 50 legendaries that they will be weak for a higher lvl character but for higher level mobs imo they could use a bit more health and dr.
---
Thank you!!
---
Its the only quest left in the boyscout update that i havent done cause it wont trigger i can even see it when playing in a team were my teamate is doing the quest
---
Thank you! Thank you! Tha k you! 
---
No one ever calls me pretty, anymore!
---
You're sooooooo sweeeet!!!
---
I think it's random. I found a glowing mothman and shot it in the head until dead as I normally do and got my torn wing that way.
---
So how does this work with regards to Friends Lists?  Which name do we add friend by, which is displayed, and what happens to an existing friend that changes name?
---
They just need to add the ability to spend scrip to increase the stars on a piece of equipment. Have a one star bloodied or AA weapon and spend scrip to increase it to a 2 star with a random second effect. This way it's still RNG but you at least get some control over what you get
---
I don't know that we're all that low-key... it's a pretty rare day that I don't see us referenced here in some capacity... usually inviting some potentially filthy newcomer ;)
---
I agree!  No one should tell you how to play and you play too much, hoard too much.. So just throw our stuff on the ground because we earned it and can't do anything with it?  That's a silly answer.  Also can't sell it to vendors because there's a cap there too.  Seems silly in a game that is worried about economy to just throw items on the ground that a player earned?
---
OR the enemies load in, but your character doesn't so you can't run or use a weapon or even jump, you can just kind of "float" around until you can fight back.
---
（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
---
Fun fact: berry mentats lets you see where the invisible enemies are. 
---
But yes they need to do something about the load order. It's not all enemies. Scorched will load in straight away.
---
Whole spread.
---
There is a Plan:Sign and Letters.
---
Maybe that one! 
---
Pretty expensive: 9200c.
---
Nuclear-powered T-pose
---
Understood. I'm a bit obsessive about collecting Gatling Guns myself. I guess primarily because that's what my 1st ever good drop was. It was only a Stalkers explosive, but it was friggin awesome to me lol.
---
To bad that i didn't see this earlier, but the vendor at watoga train station had it just now, but i have left that server :/
---
LMAO HHA LOL LMAO LOOOOL TOFLSHSHN
---
Exactly! And it lets both casual and non-casual plan how they play. You can grind or pick a few favorites and get it eventually.
---
I have only ever collected someone elses junk after a successful PVP battle or for friends who die during events to ensure that no one else takes it.  You make assumptions based on my response to this nonsensical post.
---
because no one closes the doors upon exiting.  
---
I don't want my decon shower destroyed because someone let in a glowing radstag...
---
Omg, is it part of that one :/
---
But, thanks :)
---
Yep. It is definitely a luxury buy. I just now bought it after 140 lvls of play.
---
Glad i helped!
---
I lock my doors so I can hide in my house during survival while I'm afk or as and easy fall back point.
---
If the house is locked, and I can't break in, then I'm luring monsters over.
---
Nice, the PR was my first legendary in FO4 and I used it all the way through the game, I played legitimately until I loaded mods at lvl 370-80
---
I'm considering moving back to the forest and putting up a vendor with free ammo, water, and food for people fresh out of the vault
---
Sorry dude, I'm all out of ideas.
---
Petty is downvoting me for staying the obvious.
---
People don't wipe their feet off at the door
---
, until Bethesda allows that my door will remain locked
---
Dont forget the sneaky ass floor sliders we have now too. Damn ghouls slide down the street like super fast  snakes.
---
Yeah I had a sweet sweet drop disappear before my eyes the other day....
---
I was told that you should check the area again. Sometimes the dead body/meat pile ends up somewhere else in the area or goes back to original spawn location. 
---
Hope that helps a little!
---
Most of the 3* weapons I've been getting are so bad I *know* no one will want them.  The troubleshooter's harpoon gun with 40% increased bashing damage and move faster while aiming sure looks tempting to shove in my stash to take up space.  The only way I think I would sell it was to put it at some ridiculously low cap price and hope someone buys it to chunk it in the legendary grinder.
---
I only do that if its locked and all theyre selling is halloween costumes and cop hats.
---
Wow - excellent write up, OP
---
There are nice people on PC, too. I play on PC and got a headset just for this! I go to someone's vendor, and they ask me if their prices seem fair. Someone buys stuff from me and then leaves a gift bag of plans. We're out there, I promise.
---
This would be amazing, it really couldn't understate how  much it would help the game feel more alive with updates on current things happening. I really hope they see and take note of this, couldn't be that to implement
---
\^this
---
You couldn't plana build with the "Brand New Game" But I'm sure NukesandDragons had their character build planner out just weeks after launch... You don't have to "google" anything. You're making it easier because what in the ever loving hell is the point to replaying the game or having more than 1 character at all if you can just respec how you want on the fly... Once past lv 70 the game has lost all sense of progression if you can just "respec" your high level on the fly...
---
Been waiting for you lol.

-There is an issue when trying to fast travel to your camp using the map. Fast travel option won't appear. Only fix is to open and close the map repeatedly until it finally registers that you can travel. (Sorry poor wording hope that makes sense)
---
-When setting up vending, mostly with weapons and armor, after setting an item for sale, the cursor becomes stuck at the top of the list and you can not scroll to find other items to sell. Doesn't seem to effect my machines that are only plans or mods. 
---
-occasionally during player vending, the item purchased does not appear on the upper left hand of the screen. The cap value does at the bottom but not what was sold.
---
-occasionally other vendors map markers display "Armor []" instead of the count of armor pieces
---
*qol request: would be wonderful if vendor counts could reflect legendary items or not. Such as "Armor (10)*" with a star signifying at least one item in their machine is legendary. Sucks spending 33 caps to travel to find 10 level 5 pipe guns in a machine. 
---
Animations
---
-Still have broken animations on the ghouls at whitesprings. Some are stuck laying down as they attack, others seem to zoom around the map in a sitting position. I have a video of this I believe. 
---
Also the Sheepsquatch at the free range event has gotten stuck underground for me twice now. Can not take damage. But doesn't appear that way for all players during the event. 
---
-Legendary enemy bodies often vanish upon death. No chance to loot. 
---
Other
---
-Finally encountered the vanishing gear bug. Lost a left armor piece. Did not vend/sell/trade that session. Logged off then on the next morning and it was gone. 
---
-Spawn rates for the feeder materials in the Project Paradise event do not give you enough opportunity to fill them. Played in Habitat A with 2 other players and 5 or 6 radstags spawned. I dont know if this is a scaling issue. But there was no chance to get enough venison. I've seen it's worse yet in other habitats. 
---
Free Range has odd spawning rates as well, sometimes one enemy spawns, another its 15. However in that event you aren't defendant on spawns for success. 
---
-When spawning into project paradise, often the enemies spawn before your character, resulting in invisible ghouls and robots attacking you unseen. This happens occasionally in other places too. 
---
-player to player trade windows occasionally close themselves mid trade. 
---
-several Challenges are still broken since launch.
---
Possum Badges
---
- musician and a few other badges are currently broken and not completable.
---
Not luxury, i made 10000c these 2 days(ofc, i had some luck with some buyers) and i’m lvl 80. 
---
But doesn’t kinda worth it. 
---
I bought some signs from Atomic and it was a better deal for me 500 atomic points than 9k caps.
---
Online games don't actually require a lot of bandwidth while playing, despite the scale of the world, fo76 is essentially a 24 player game, which was achieved even in analog modem days.
---
One of the dev's replied and said it was a fun idea, not sure if that means it will ever come up for consideration though.
---
along with what everyone else said, the railway rifle is a popular choice. I love mine both in it's semi auto and auto form. Kills everything but doesn't require lead for ammo. Kill super mutant, harvest gun, scrap and make ammo.
---
Not everyone has good intentions. Someone led 3 super mutants into my house when it was unlocked. They destroyed about 70% of my house including my fusion genny and rad shower. The guy sat there an took pictures and posed while my camp was being leveled. 
---
I leave a stash box out and access to a power armor bench so you can scrap. Sorry to take it out on everyone but the easiest way to avoid situations like that is to not put yourself in them to begin with.
---
if only there wasn‘t a glowing level 91 deathclaw walking around whitesprings, i would check the entire area. haha
---
Oh I meant moreso to sell them, not to use. I look for 3* to use for scrip. I have like 40k caps across 3 characters so I'm constantly buying up 3* to scrip out.
---
My bloodied pipe rifle does 945 dmg per shot at 20% health
---
Yeah sometimes they just shift a few feet or turn into a meat pile. So always triple check the area. Though disappearing corpses has been an old problem.
---
"And as a further incentive to enjoy your 3 night stay, all golfers on the course witnessing a Scorched interfering with their ball in play is entitled to a complimentary Mulligan!"
---
(Some terms and conditions may apply.  Only one Mulligan per player per hole. Dispatching a Scorched after merely witnessing it in the vicinity of the ball in play may invalidate the Mulligan.  Final approval or denial of Mulligan will be left to the judgment of the Robot Course Marshal.  Wanton destruction of the robot Course Marshal merely because of bad judgment both invalidates the Mulligan and will limit player\[s\] causing such destruction to a one drink minimum at the 19th Hole.)
---
im not on ps4, im on pc.  
---
my experience:  
---
 occasionally the "invite to trade" doesn't work for me and my buddy so we jump around like idiots from time to time, but invites have been stable so far.
---
Yeah I bought mine because I got really close to cap max and wanted space. It's looks very nice and gives my shop / base a nice feel. But I definitely didn't need it to carry on in the game.
---
Never in my post did I say it wasn’t how the game was intended, but please tell me when you’ve nuked Billings homestead?
---
10-4 thanks for the heads up. I’ll go there with caution.
---
welcome back!
---
I haven’t touched survival, but didn’t they change it to where the default leaderboard is number of pvp kills?
---
Wtb: non-duped stick. H: caps.
---
If they really want a Brahmin meat so badly, there is few of them at flatwoods. Just server hop if need more.
---
I get it, some people have awful connections as their only choice, or their company gives them a data cap and it can be a huge pain.  
---
My parents don't even live that remotely but growing up our fastest option was 1.5mb/s. It was abysmal, and I remember starting games to download overnight so I could play them the next day when it was just 7 - 10gb.
---
Thanks for the honest response. ‘And actually detailing why you feel that way!’ I haven’t hit endgame so I’ll at least give it till then before I throw in the towel.
---
Nah, it's a gun that goes Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew.
---
I had that problem when I would join their party but not when they joined mine. Not sure if it’s the same on PS4 though.
---
As a general estimate, most online games need 1-3mbps down, around 1mbps up. Depending on the game, and latency is more important, of course.
---
Right?! That’s how I felt when I jumped back in!
---
You can do the same thing on ps4 but I prefer listening to the radio
---
I wish my girlfriend would give me a Mr. Handy
---
This is what I'm say'n 
---
DOWN WITH MUTANTS.... BUILD THE SENTINELS....SCREW THE X-MEN!!!!!!
---
wait, different world.....my bad.
---
I’m always the guy that sells shells for 1cap, seems like most enemies drop whatever ammo I’m not using. RIP .45
---
I have yet to even find a tamable creature. It's honestly kind of infuriating.
---
Yeah no I’ll kill anything I want to on the server. Cry some more.
---
If you are not in combat you heal
---
It only works when you aren’t in combat. But it heals you to full health super quick. So stim packs and other healing items should be used in combat.
---
Hey man, we all have our vices 😉
---
Need nuka cola! Doctor says I’ve shot my liver...
---
So it vacation already works.
---
Pretty sure they all are. It's a charisma perk.
---
It fucks you on regular and diluted stims, but you won’t need any after combat, bc as soon as you kill the last threat, you immediately heal to full health
---
i found it. i risked my life for a weightless fucking wood arm. lol 
---
but at least i also found another legendary who dropped a +30% damage to robots minigun
---
"Swarm of Suitors" doesn't end well for everyone, I suppose
---
I love this game but having to re- download the whole game every update sucks scorched balls
---
On my daughters computer that I didn't update after last patch it's wanting to do an update that requires 50 gb of free space... so consider yourself lucky.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bskjg5/what_the_hell_why_do_i_need_50_gb_free_to_update/
---
I have locked doors in two of my characters CAMPs... it's for "theatrics" only. There's something behind it, and I am trying to emphasize that it's a "character"/background/RP thing. No lvl 3 locks, highest is a lvl 1.
---
I used to lock them all at lvl 0 just to keep the ghouls out... but meh. I'd rather just repair stuff...
---
Or you could get all up in the misses' gutsies...
---
I’ve see that.  
---
During a Nuke event at White Springs I will do one more circuit before leaving just to check all of the meat piles.  
---
I also tend to pick up everything.  This causes the meat piles to go away and anything left is investigated.  It’s annoying to have to drop crap due to becoming overweight but it’s the only reliable method that I’ve found. 
---
I had a weird one the other day.  I killed a gulper with bloody mess equipped and the headless body ended up on the branch that it was originally hanging from.  Never did get the meat pile for that one.  But it wasn’t legendary, so no loss.
---
Legend post, gods work here!!! Tyvm
---
thanks.
---
Works well with the escape artist perk. If I get overwhelmed I can usually escape long enough to heal.
---
My humor emitter array requires recharging.
---
Hah! You win today.
---
Glad to be back! Not gonna lie, I was super let down on beta+launch. Now that you all have put a little more into the game, and resolved some of the major software issues, it’s an awesome place to be!
---
Railway rifle .. tsjook tsjook :D
---
not to mention cheap AF ammo
---
They’re on XB1, too, I’m pretty sure! I just need to try harder to find them.
---
That part they can leave out. Codsworth took 3 days to come up with another joke.
---
I have run into max level super mutants in the Morgantown Airport.  I think it was a bug tho
---
hmm... if someone bitched at me about that I would move my camp to be as close to theirs as I could get and reduce all my ammo prices to 0
---
Yes. BIV would be amazing. He could have listener callins by Rose,Vlad or Mia and adds for the prizebot. Even better if insult bot randomly called up and insulted a player on their server!
---
Ah ok. I actually sell a good amount of 1-2* items. Probably 1-3 a day in the limited time I am on (1-2 hours). I have around 60 legendary weapons and 30 armor on my main character and my vending character. I prefer selling usefull 1*s over 3*s that are not actually usefull but perceived as good because they are 3 star.
---
He one up'd you. That's petty? Not to me.
---
Just a random insult to everyone on the server. Lol.
---
I still don't understand why we can't have respecing though. If you're so against it, don't use it. It'll be there as an option for someone like me that doesn't have the time to invest into the game.
---
Oh, nice one :)
---
Project Paradise hasn’t worked for me all week. I’m not even going the length to try and ask them(support) for help because i’ve seen a few threads on here where people try to get a hand from Bethesda and they say that it’s not on their end, it’s the user’s internet connection—— but I, like them, can still play literally anything else in the Game World..... EXCEPT project paradise. I have put more money into this game for atoms than i even paid for the game at this point, and they shiny new event doesnt even work! So, i’m saying arrogantly, FIGURE IT OUT AND FIX IT!(since thats the only advice anybody will end up giving me, based on my research!)
---
Nice!   
---
while you are at it have persons 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 7 and 8 waiting in each habitat to aggressively cram ingredients into the hopper to get all rank 3 friendlies! :)
---
In the top right corner of the map where those mountains are above the bunker and Freddy's house of scares in the mire there's a random spawn at a pond with a crashed vertibot in it - that's where I get my pets. 
---
RIP Slooty.
---
Well, considering that one-shit kills are still a thing... no.
---
You need to remove all the fullstops I just read the bracketed part in the prizebot t&amp;c voice lol
---
That's enough r/fo76 for me today
---
That∆
---
I have had so many people tell me you only need one piece, this just isnt so , True pvp you will see very little benefit. I have tested this thoroughly in pve and the more you have the better it works.  I am in constant hidden or caution for almost all of a white spring run even better at harpers ferry and better still if I am doing the watoga high event .  With only a stealth mod knife instigating one shotting hundreds of ghouls without being detected.  The other day I tested on a 95 glowing death claw walked up behind him one shot with gronks axe
---
You can have a completely viable stealth melee build pve
---
Top right hand corner of the map above the Halloween costume shop there is a downed vertibird in a pond. In front if it spawns different random events including all kinds of tamable animals.
---
If you want a deathclaw, I know there’s a chance for one to spawn at the kiddie corner cabins, and another one along the cliffs north for prickett’s fort. 
---
That being said, how much free space do you have to have for a creature? Because I deleted about a fifth of my camp and still can’t take one. I know that animal fiend can’t take deathclaws any more, but I thought wasteland whisperer could. I mean I know that it’ll calm them down so they aren’t aggro, but I was hoping I could still snag one home with it too.
---
I love the sloths but they just die all the time, I've watched them out in the field just doing what they do and for no reason, plop... dead :(
---
"have a nice day"
---
Unoptimized textures looks like that
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer
---
&gt;"A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), using aspects of the game in unintended ways."
---
I looked it up. Fits that description perfectly. Seems you're the one lacking the grasp on what that term means.
---
No super mutant messes with Thomas the death engine. Choooo choooo.
---
Seriously. The railway rifle cut a huge chunk out of my farming time. No more lead, no more acid, no more extra food for the extra farming time. Just kill scrap craft repeat.
---
I loved the concept/visual of burning the hell out of your allies to heal em, but yeah, doesn’t seem to do all that much.  Quack plus the various “grant allies X after reviving” perks are really nice, plus the Luck card “Dry Nurse” If you’re low on stims/booze.  Don’t think it applies to alcoholic rezzes, but still nice :)
---
I am honestly not sure where they got it or what it was.
---
I found the poor fella you get it from in the parking lot of the Water Park up north. Slumped against one of the blown out cars.
---
Golly you know why it’s a failure? I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO EVEN LOAD THE  THING UP! I can go anywhere else, do anything else, hold 5 workshops, but nope, no P.P. For me! (YES. I know what i said there 🤣) anybody else failing to even get past the elevator?
---
If I'm the only one at an event I'll one shot everything but when someone else is there I'll switch to whatever weapon leaves the enemy with the smallest silver of health left so they only have to hit shit once
---
Oh. If you want a very nice non legendary, get a lvl 50 fixer. There is a roughly 20% extra damage bonus unwritten in that weapon over a normal combat rifle and you get sneak bonus on top.
---
This exactly. Bought a bloodied 3* hunting rifle for 800 caps resold for 10k. Thanks people.
---
I had birdbones… loved jumping off cliffs. 
---
and then, I cured it, but forgot that I cured it, and jumped off a cliff.
---
This is kinda where Im planning on taking my build. Do you know if the perks like revenant that buff you when you are revived work with self revives and mysterious savior revives?
---
Safety glasses off Motherfucker!
---
If you're not in combat you heal but it nerfs the shit out of stimpaks. Mostly not worth it I found.
---
\^\^ this
---
Nice find.
---
Bring it to android!
---
He's asking about a railway rifle tho... and yes the TSE can give exttas, I think the spikes have a 50% chance of being on the corpse, so you have two chances with two shot railway.  Sometimes you'll get 2 when you only shot one.  Not quite as consistent as the harpoon with flechettes but it's pretty close to infinite ammo
---
Wondering the same thing.
---
/u/ladydevann /u/valseek
---
Can you guys provide any details?
---
I have a few ideas:
---
You should have to respawn back at Vault 76 and lose the number of caps it would cost for you to have to travel from your location to the vault. 
---
You drop your loot, only you can pick it back up by paying caps.  
---
I have a few ideas, but the only part of the equation I have an issue with is other people being able to pick it up so easily. I get attacked by a mob and some guy safe off in the distance walks up behind me upon death, at an event for example, and gets my stuff? Just seems like a sketchy awful thing to me. I’m not sure what Bethesda were thinking. In theory I could drop several hundred caps of useful stuff.
---
I’m looking for people to play with in PS4 buuut I’m only lvl 17 😑🔫
---
He meant to say weapon artisan I believe
---
Took a vid where I literally spin in circles for over 15 seconds stabbing and getting xp while getting hit and taking damage. Super cool.
---
Yep that the most popular, but the other one is the cavelier build which is alot funner to play, makes use of shotgun enforcer to stagger, and unarmed weapons to finish. But you need to close the distance before your ap runs out.
---
Mr. New Vegas. Probably my favorite.
---
&gt;What could we possibly do to your house?
---
Cost me money. 
---
I keep my switches inside the house.  When I jump on Survival I want to make sure that my vendors are off so my camp isn't visible. Rather than having to store them and restock, it's far easier to simply turn them off through a switch. 
---
If my doors were unlocked, what people could possibly do (and have done before I started locking the doors), is turn off vendors .  So I keep my doors locked so people don't mess with switches.  
---
Besides, it's my space, not yours. I go there to relax, listen to the radio in peace, and sometimes play pipboy games. I don't want some douchebag coming in and tea-bagging me while I'm doing some crafting (which has also happened).
---
Looks like an awesome Vulcan, too.
---
I'd assume you'd use their actual account name and then the chosen display name would be what you see in-game. Hopefully this is clarified.
---
Fair call, those guys with the stick deserve it
---
To them, I say... pffft.
---
I sell shit I don't want or need... for cheap. If you wanna buy it and resell it? Go for it. If a player with no caps can get some good gear for a good price and have fun? Even better. I'm not selling stuff with the dupers and power gamers in mind... I'm selling it for lvl 1 - 25 crowd.
---
Duplicate plans? I sell for dirt cheap. I want folks to be able to build the character and CAMP they want. That's the point of this game isn't it? To have some fun being someone else? 
---
In all seriousness, I find that games like this are very "telling" about who people are when nobody is watching. It's a video game version of the anonymity of the internet.
---
The base game was like 4/10. After the updates it's like an 8/10. Not sure if it's Stockholm syndrome from making myself play 760 hours of the un-updated version of the game lol
---
The game has improved loads recently. I dont know when you last played but we've had several new pieces of content, new bosses, mechanic reworks, duping removals, griefing removes and so on. The game runs smoother now. 
---
You only lose 50 caps on pvp death in adventure instead of whatever your level was and I think that one change made most people turn away from being "raiders" now. Before that update it used to be the best way to make money in the game. Just go to a level 400s workshop and contest it and shoot him in the back for 400 caps
---
I sell big ticket items. Powered/sentinel gear, tons of various weapons all high quality. I've had people ask me over voice chat about items they're looking for but can't afford yet. I charge 10-12k for great rolled bloodied gear.
---
If someone verbally chats with me they usually get it free or cheaper. I'm constantly sitting on about 100k caps and buy/sell all day. My 2 characters are insanely geared now. Genuinely I'm struggling to think of upgrades.
---
I bought one from someones vendor for 5k:)good price i think
---
Hahahahaha!
---
You can't anymore
---
Yeah....it's good. It is probably the literal golden gun in this game (I know your out their GoldenEye players). You just ask for whatever you want for it. That includes multiple characters worth of caps.
---
This is where I am at too
---
My Combat Knives have changed my game a lot. They hit so fast and even my no* Serrated Combat Knife clears the entire Golf Course and surrounding Ghoul infested areas easily. My 3* Nocturnal 40% Speed one is a god roll. It starts out around 190 and escalates quickly as Adrenaline kicks in. It one shots most everything in that exercise and it can hit around 4 times a sec. Stuff does not get to respond, outside of serious surround swarming, and that evaporates quickly anyway. 
---
 Just an example. I don't like Bloodied much but I do have a Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher and I love explosions, so it gets used sometimes.
---
 I have an X0-1, mainly for the Jet Pack but it does not get used much. BoS Heavy Combat FTW. ;)
---
TSE’s were the god tier weapons before the nerf. Not so much now. 
---
Yes the demolition perk reflects your damage although it’s not listed when you look at the weapon on your PIP boy. It’s obvious when you shoot an enemy. 
---
Heavy guns for the Queen like a bloodied Gatling Plasma work good on super tanky enemies, as well as bloodied explosive LMG but ammo consumption is a bitch on that. 
---
Depends on your play style. Day to day I am stealth covert commando and I can easily take out a normal scorchbeast with Fixer or my handmade
---
Queen endgame battles and such I switch everything over to heavy gunner and blast away. 
---
You should keep your eye out for Anti-Armor, Explosive, two shot ( yes it’s two bullets ) and instigating. 
---
My teammate uses a two shot dragon and a two shot lever action three star with faster fire and crazy VATS buff. He’s unstoppable at Whitespring. He’s chameleon rifle stealth all the way with his perception legendaries putting him in the 20’s for perception and high agility. Enemies just walk past him.
---
It's called attacking them until they fight back
---
Wahhh. I would. I totally would.
---
“What are they making film out of these days!?!”
---
Hi, i'll add you soon as i need to do some things before i get on
---
Hey, I got a water pump outside my building, just drink from the hose until you are satisfied.
---
Oh I would love this. It would be so cool to shoot a fat man and see those high numbers pop, also it would help a lot comparing weapons' dps and item effects like psyco.
---
Not that it would crazy useful with stuff like the minigun but lots of numbers on the screen look cool too, it really gives you that high rate of fire feel.
---
I doubt they can actually add something like this in an update but anyway, cool idea.
---
Twice now, I've logged in as normal to see my CAMP not showing up on the map as a vendor.
---
No big deal, maybe a mob destroyed a power conduit or connector or tower, right?
---
Nope, everything was wired perfectly, power flowing, machines at the CAMP showed stock, everything should be normal.
---
The first time I tried all of the following to no avail:
---
*Logging out/in, 
---
*Power cycling the Xbox and logging in, 
---
*Storing and replacing the Power Source (first time a Fusion Generator, second time a Windmill), 
---
*Deleting all the Power Lines to ensure it wasn't a faulty line, 
---
*Completely building a new power source just for the machines (more on that in a moment).
---
With no fix, I sighed and restocked all 4 machines and made sure to give them their own power source as some folks said that there was a bug with the Fusion Generator and the machines.
---
Fast forward to today, when I log in to see my CAMP not showing as a Vendor.
---
This second time I tried all of the following to no avail:
---
*Completely building a new power source just for the machines, 
---
*Blueprinting the machines as they were so at least I wouldn't have to stock them again.
---
Since none of this worked, again, I have to restock 120 items in my machines....again.
---
For those of us who don't just sell on game default price and take the time to ensure a balance in the prices of each item between making sweet sweet caps and giving a fair price for the people who visit (as in not charging 500 caps for basic non-rare outfits, 20 caps for Purified Water, etc) this gets extremely annoying and honestly just makes me walk away from the game for a bit instead of playing.
---
Can someone offer me a bug fix, either a fellow fan telling me what I'm doing wrong or a Bethesda community guide sending this to their team?
---
Nooooooooo.
---
Honestly I know that you won't have perks cards to help boost damage but I would go for an auto barrel. It will help with crowd control and it will still do decent damage because of the effects on it.
---
I swear I got the metal helmet by scrapping it, but this was way way back before the very first patch. Aside from this half remembered Maybe it’s never happened since.
---
That’s a really good question and I hope someone at Bethesda asked that before they made the change!
---
You did kill him. He turns into a pile of dust upon death. If he just flies away he doesn't leave anything.
---
I... am not sure what point you were trying to make with this post? You basically restated what I said in my post, then went off on a tangent about stealth melee viability. Cool I guess?
---
I have that mutation but I'm regretting it. Screws up your stim packs in combat making you use more over time unless you have a autostim legendary which isn't affected by the -55% but that's once every 30sec. And out of combat there's no real need for fast healing.
---
Good attitude. I'm sure the game you love will grow because of it.
---
No I am sick of them also, can't do some of the merit badges also and that makes me frustrated
---
My little heart can only hope
---
If people would read the signs and shut the damn door I wouldn’t lock it. I don’t even have anything inside to protect or steal but coming back to camp to open doors makes my eye twitch
---
Funny thing is, I was about to log off but I usually let a shopper finish first.
---
WHITE SPRINGS HAVE RANDOM DEATHCLAWS AND GRAFTON MONSTERS
---
"Unintended ways."
---
Wow, your reading comprehension needs work too. Explain how this is an unintended use of the mechanic. One shotting mobs in a game where *YOU* are the one trying to exploit the system as much as possible to maximize the amount of high level equipment gained does not make the person one-shotting mods a griefer.
---
Somebody doing something you don't like doesn't make them a griefer. I don't like it when people price items at the cap limit. It doesn't make them griefers.
---
I emphasize with the OP, and while I think that 500 (or "infinite") scrip is too much, I do believe that 150 is too little of a daily cap. 
---
**Make it 200 Scrip a day.**
---
Not a massive boost, but it makes a bit more sense considering the prices they've chosen, and it allows players a bit more freedom in choosing what to get rid of, and when. Early on, I had trouble making ends meet; since Weapons and Armor are worth different amounts that lead into you being "locked into" a certain amount, which you may not be able to afford with anything. (For instance: 2 Scrip left, after exchanging a combination of Weapons and Armor. You can't get it, and you're set behind for the total amount of rolls you can get for a particular amount of time.)
---
150 is also a strange number considering that most people are gunning for the 100 Scrip drops, so it makes little sense for the current Scrip limit, if you're going to be left at an odd number for the day. Considering that this is full-blown, in-game gambling (with no real-world currency use, yet); I see no downsides to slightly increasing the available daily Scrip a player is able to get.
---
I've got the camera and they're still a pain. Most involve specific outfits or mobs which can be a pain to locate.  They can go bye bye.
---
How many friendly creatures were alive when the plan dropped for you? This is VERY important to me, so I would really appreciate knowing. :)
---
I wish I could send you my Pip-boy to make all fancy like this. It really looks great!
---
I started it but its long from being done.
---
Ah man, this is good. This is good stuff. 
---
It would prompt people to actually listen to the radio...
---
I’ve always wondered why:
---
I get a notification when the Sons of Dane event is beginning, but not for anything else. There are way more important events going on that I’d rather be notified about.
---
Half of them just seem so tedious and impossible to do, like find an alien? Lol good luck on that one XD
---
I really wouldn't mind if it was one every once in a while, but it's just too much at this point, if anything give hard ones that aren't camera related!
---
This one is rough during combat. In fact unless your running max freak you run the risk of actually dying which is tough in this game if you need to use a stim.
---
I use diluted stims and on the rare occasion I'm caught I'll bang two stims in succession.  With class freak mazes they do work enough to keep me upright.
---
I started it, but it’s long from being done.
---
Two shot fires a second shot at no ammo expense that would do an extra 20% damage if it ever hit anything. Explosive does 20% if you hit in the vague area of your enemy, hence the two effects go well together. Personally I'd rather have anti armor or executors. Explosive is alright but you need perks/armor to not blow yourself up all the time.
---
Eh if you can find the mod in someones shop for 50 caps sure. The bigger number ppl see when they check the more likely they are to buy it.
---
You're defending the theft of other peoples junk. I'm going to have to assume that you're in favor of stealing other peoples shit.
---
Still have no clue what it's like to play this event.
---
I seem to have weird glitch over the last couple weeks with the weights of barrels on rifles. The long barrels weigh less for me than short barrels. Has this been noted before?
---
I believe you must be using both in order to tame a deathclaw now - another user used both and was able to tame one today and I have tamed two since the patch since people spawned near my camp and anglers killed one D:
---
Would be nice
---
I dont think it's only sloths - I've had the same happen with my Yao Guai as well :&lt;
---
These are not considered random spawns and cannot be tamed.
---
Thank you so much for all of your hard work! Any chance you could do one for treasure map locations?
---
I dig 'em except the jokes about animal abuse. Gags about drowning cats in a river isn't my cup of tea.
---
You can see here that many games average 200-400 kbs per second.
---

---
FO76 likely has a lot of networking similarities to those games since Beth said they pretty much brought in the Quake network model (which some of those games are descendants of).
---
Of not the higher average ones are those that have higher tick rates, and I don't think FO76 is a high tick rate game.
---
You can see Fortnite with 100 players but a lower tick rate has much lower bandwidth (45kbps!) than Battlefield 64 players but higher tick. 
---
In the case of FO76 there aren't just players, but monsters, while in the worse case, Arkos Pharma perhaps, with ~24 players and 3x monsters(?) I can see things getting higher, but not multiple mbps higher.
---
Most of the time you only have a few players in networking distance and less than a dozen enemies around.
---
So, why is Bethesda Launcher downloading this patch **again** today? And it's 7.5 GB. On PC.
---
that is also not bad
---
My Charisma is at 5 with Hard Bargain and maybe +2 with some armor. I sell them for 460-500 consistently. Jokes on them really. You can max out a vendor with 3 of them for a few days.
---
Well done sir. Love the atom shop feature, looking at sales while at work lol. Just need it on android now!!
---
You have to open locked door during phase 1, find terminal and get deactivation code and deactivate alexa (i don't remember her name )on the terminal then mr. handy will take experiment into his own hands and will use formula q instead of p. Event becomes really hard and i never get it done in like 7+ runs, because animals are attacking enemies instead of running. But i think that's how you get fornula q plan
---
Met some player stuck in this state (or bugged it on purpose) at a train station. Wearing a Nuka Girl outfit, with the black rider PA chest piece and helmet (without a frame, so I'm guessing there's an exploit that does this). Freakiest shit I've encountered in this game so far.
---
Some of them are fun but they get a little old since we're doing them all the time. I really wish they would do a bigger rotation of things to do.
---
Has anyone found the location of that guy?
---
In practice, the consequences are, you die, you have to pay a cap or two to re-spawn (every single fucking time for me, unless I die on top of a fast travel point). If you die in an event, as it ends, you don't get event rewards, often you don't get boss loot drops as the boss _simply isn't there_ when you go back in. 
---
There are already PLENTY of "punishments" for people who die in this game.
---
I have the same problem too much stuff stashed on a mule, but since I have created 4 characters I transfer items to each of them to use in the machine and when they run out transfer more and  eventually all the junk will be gone.
---
Well, the ‘balancing’ i was thinking of for that- which people probably wouldnt be too pleased about- is that you don’t get to choose the legendary effects. Like there’s options to imbue 1/2/3 stars of effects onto a non legendary item of your choice, and then you just. Get a random roll.
---
I’d also add a ‘reroll’ option, maybe let you pick WHICH effect you want to reroll, but not just allow people to slap any effect they’d like onto any item.
---
Im starting to think they are trolling..
---
Bloodied stealth build with a good knife. As long as you're quick and they don't touch you, you can deal a lot of damage without even waking them. Walk right up to super mutants, stabby, stabby.
---
My Gatling plasma is well over a 100 damage per shot and it has a fire rate of 91
---
My LMG’s damage is well over 100 with explosive, adrenal, bloodied and adrenaline.  Fire rate 159
---
My Fixer does 114 damage and it’s automatic fire rate 75
---
Explosive handmade at 129 fire rate 75
---
Auto Tesla does 135 damage fire rate 91
---
My oh shit deathclaw gauntlet does between 250 and 300 as it’s not bloodied and I don’t have perks for it.  Bloodied deathclaws can reach damages of 1700 +
---
Thanks, I’ll try my best to get it done for android.
---
I mean finding graham in a workshop? I barely even see him lol
---
updates anybody? I'm waiting on a support ticket as I comment!
---
Yeah I did read about the auto barrel but somebody said that because it’s explosive that it acts differently or something? Something to do with the arcs it fires?
---
Works the same for Phantom Devices. I bet Mark IIIs too! Good job OP you cracked the case
---
Firing heavy weapons in third person while in power armor can cause you to move slower when you have stopped firing and locks you into third person. Work around is to unequip and re equip heavy gun. Gatling lasers, plasmas, and mini guns can spool up but not fire rounds even though the guns are doing the animation they are not firing. This is on Xbox one.
---
You need a bigger OS drive 10gb free only is pushing it a bit with today huge games. Have you a second installed drive or external, dump everything space hogging onto those and delete them from the main drive, then try again.
---
finally somebody understands me :)
---
The mayor of grafton has a radio station. They could spin the station into something like that.
---
TSE was op before the nerf. Back then it was 1 shot at base damage, 2nd or (ts) at 100% of base damage and 100% explosive. 
---
Since then it is the Ts has been reduced to 25% and the explosive is 20% if I’m not mistaken. 
---
It’s been a minute since I’ve checked it, but I thought demolition expert was nerfed as well because of this. But that’s does still effect the explosive damage. 
---
As for dps the two shot base damage is always higher because it includes the TS but not the explosive. 
---
My handmade with full rifle perks is right around 250 with full health. 
---
Now I’d say that effect is more inline with 2 or 3 other effects, but this also depends on pvp or pve.
---
Anti armor and bloodied are pretty much king right now if combo’d with explosive or faster fire rate. They work well in either. They also seem to be the answer to each others builds. 
---
Bloodied can hit crazy dps when at low health and combo’d with adrenal. Seen them at like 1.5 to 3k. 
---
Anti armor usually shows a regular dps but because your ignoring 50% of armor it does quite a bit more.
---
I have no idea if it acts different, never had one. But everyone I see with it has the auto barrel.
---
Ironically I didn't see a single rad scorpion in that zone that day. I looked for an hour.
---
Thanks for the info man!
---
This is actually potentially super useful. If we can heal our ghoul escorts with gamma guns, that could potentially make them the most viable way to win the event...
---
With that quality, you should open a side business.
---
Cheaper than a hooker
---
Made from the rarest and most beautiful unobtainium.
---
Ey at least you found it. 
---
I gave up on finding it. 
---
And I can tell you this much: it was a furious handmade...
---
Nice intel. Queen of the Hunt could have made the Mothman spawn a walk in the park, but Mire dailies are bugged and not working at the moment.
---
Saw this on Gnews with the Reddit symbol and thought it was for Reddit.
---
If power is connected, screens are on and fully stocked, should be all you need. I use a fusion generator just fine. 
---
Sounds like a bug to me. You should open a ticket with bugthesda. They won't  see this post, but they will see your ticket. Whether or not they will do something about it is a different story. But it's worth a shot.
---
Welp thx anyways
---
That is a big if there.
---
They've seen other posts but I should submit at ticket. I'm trying to gauge if this is a wide spread problem like the Arktos elevator was for XB1 users or if this is just a me thing, and if it is widespread if there is a workaround.
---
What if what are you talking about
---
I just recycled a level 50 2\* bloodied railway rifle for script, tried it with my bloodied build and couldn't kill s\*it, went back to melee.
---
Tried selling it and no interest. Too heavy to store so got rid of it.
---
Only thing I can think of, is even though you say everything was wired perfectly, it might not me. I've had the same problem before, and have noticed that have to trace every wire, and found one...just one not connected somewhere.
---
Aside from that, go into build mode and mouse over your vending machines. Is the electricity symbol red? This means they aren't getting power for some reason. That goes back to not being somehow connected (Fallout 4 was finicky like this too), so after checking again, if thing are indeed connected as they should be, check if you have enough power generators. If you do, then it might be a wiring bug, only thing I can suggest is to scrap all the wires again as you did and try to run a direct power line from a conduit to those Vending machines.
---
Another thing comes to mind, was your camp damaged in any way? Are any of your generators or power nodes damaged? If not, try scrapping and power conduits you have and then create and re-wire new ones.
---
I have two fusion generators running, and run a water farm. at first I exceeded my the power I had available by having too many purifiers. 
---
What else do you have that use power directly? Maybe you don't have enough total power?
---
.308 ammo is also appreciated. that hunting rifle is a staple for the first 20 or so levels.
---
Unless you're sneaking/crouching which you should be anyways.
---
F*ck'n hate those challenges, and the damn camera quest itself. I'd rather kill 10 scorchbeasts every day than take a photo of a Brahmin, fox, frog, opossum, Radstag or whatever the hell in every region
---
thats just 1 example. bloodied/junkies guns sell extremely high. I'll happily sit on something at 10k cost for a week until someone buys it. My shops isn't going anywhere.
---
Through player vending I've got a full set of junkies 3* weapons. All outstanding. And an entire set of 3* unyielding gear. Most with cav/sent. Players price things really strangely.
---
Legendary cryolator.
---

---
Wasn't all ammo under 1 cap each except cores? I haven't even sold any and it's all 1 each.
---
People that lock their doors don't seem to understand how easy it is for a mob to destroy a wall. At the very least they could have an upstairs door unlocked so we can get out when we load inside their houses.
---
On the FO76 Filthy Casual Discord server we have a room called i-have-grahm. When someone runs into Grahm, or the lemonade stand, or trick-or-treaters, or whatever random spawn you can think of, they post their username and platform so other people can jump in and meet them.
---
They certainly are fun to do. I'm always open to commisions for doing them anyways!
---
Yes. That and the 44.
---
Ah, damn. Guess I’ll have to size my camp down and server hop again. But thanks for letting me know!
---
You guys doing a dozen SBQ runs a day, maxing out multiple accounts of mules with caps and items need to step back and figure out that Bethesda isn’t going to change things for the player who has no job and no life and plays the game all day every day obsessively. 
---
It’s always the PC crowd that seems to think this is normal. Like my coworker who lives with his parents and plays rust all day every day, but doesn’t understand that he needs to shower before coming to work because “the reason I smell so bad is because I didn’t have time to shower before I came to work because I only got three hours of sleep after playing rust” is not an adequate excuse for why we all have to put up with your stench. 
---
Tldr: the script limit is only a problem for the no lifers. It’s not going to 500 a day so you can empty all your mules.
---
there was free grain, corn, and mutfruit...
---
Try putting a switch between the vendors and power source.
---
Seems I kept having issues until placing a switch and haven't had a problem since then (except when someone is in my spot and I gotta restock)
---
3
---
Have they added this feature yet?
---
So that glowing radstag will break your wall down and then destroy your decon shower. It's not like a locked door is going to protect your base.
---
Some enemies shouldn't be one-shottable. This is a survival game, there should be a little resistance to regular mobs. Ammo expenditure is a survival aspect that one-shots undermine.
---
The way it is now is fine, most enemies (lvl 62 ghouls) can be one-shotted while others either inflict a little damage back before they die (lvl 68 super mutants) or actually give a decent fight (lvl 65 Sheepsquatch)
---
Do you guys remember pre-nerf TSEs? You could one-shot a Mirelurk Queen no problem. That's not fun, it made the game boring lol
---
Seriously. I was fighting some player and he would hop up and I could get one hit with my Sole Survivor lever action and do a bunch of damage but then he would fall below cover and healing factor would fix him up and he would hop up again. We did this for three times and I switched to the AA handmade.  It killed him quick.
---
I enjoyed that encounter.
---
I have before and it's a weird lag. I usually hop servers
---
Also much thanks!
---
Generally a sign of shit server, leave fast.
---
True... but hes a giant dick too though.
---
I think it is. Not always glowing but there's always a Deathclaw there. 
---
I serverhopped once there for an aplha deathclaw challenge. No sight of an alpha, but always some kind of deathclaw there.
---
I *would not* build a camp there but that's up to you lol
---
You're flaming people because you don't get to farm as many legendaries as you want. That's flat out what it is.
---
I'll give you credit for not improperly using the term griefing. What I will say is that I disagree with your reasoning. Players should not be blamed for how Bethesda has structured the game. Demanding that people not optimize their builds so you can exploit the mechanic to farm as many legendaries as you can is petty.
---
Oh crap i forgot to mention the phantom devices. Thats one of the ones we tested too.
---
Yea that's what I thought... that is what happened every other time I've fought him.. until this last after patch 9.5.. I know I didnt kill him cuz he was alittle under half health and was trying to get a pic with him.. he got up from being crippled, stood up and fly into the sky and left a pile of dust behind..
---
Yeah same havent tested it since this latest patch
---
try buying it from a vendor, dropping it to the ground and then pick it back up?
---
I'd rather have to kill a Windigo with bare fists and naked, at least then I can delude myself into thinking it can be done. I've played since Beta and I've never even seen an alien.
---
I've had people shut them down via the switch before. It's really annoying, because i can spend a full hour or more away from camp and entire time could be offline. Freaking trolls....
---
Probably over 2k damage. My double barrel did about 15-1600 hundred no buffs besides perks
---
looking for PvP orientated people? you should already know me add me on discord xXDemolisher#3428
---
We can't have it because it would break the game... Are you listening to what I'm saying? Allowing a full Respec any time diminishes any replay value this game has. It doesn't take that much time to Respec. If you have enough time to get past level 50, then you have time to do it again... Sorry if it takes you a while to get a different build. I only have 250 hours and I have 3 separate builds for a reason. All over 50 now. Because o took the time to invest in different characters. Having a full respect any time just makes the game exceedingly easy. Do what the rest of us do and stop investing all of your time on one character and you wouldn't have this complaint.
---
Pipe rifle and pipe bolt used to benefit from both perks for some time but that has been fixed
---
For me, the load screens would be 5+ minutes long. And yes, I've timed it. 450Mbit connection down, the fastest SSD available on the market, but it still takes 5 minutes for my base to load in, for legendary scrip exchanges to come in, DLC doors to pop in. It's insane.
---
Never used to be this bad until the patch where they took action against dupers.
---
Interesting. Buying counted for me when I completed the challenge. Is Nuka Grape the only one you’re having issues with?
---
Really? I have a 1*. I had it as a semi auto doing close to 500 damage a shot and now I have it as a full auto doing 350 ish a rail. It's not as much as my handmade but the ammo cost is soooo much cheaper.
---
have someone else buy and drop it for you to pick up.
---
I completed that quest and assumed the robots and friends would back off.  However, I kept getting attacked for the next couple of gaming sessions.  I finally got tied of Watoga and went elsewhere.  Recently, in the past month, I've come back to Watoga several times and the 'bots seem to leave me alone.  Maybe, there's a game "lag" before everybody gets the word, eh?
---
You can find one on a shelf in the locker in the bunker/room where you get the X01 Nuka-Quantum paint.
---
I don't recall other posts with your issue, so probably not as wide spread. Most of the vending machine bugs i see posted are with having to re-add all inventory for sale as it goes back to stash after logging off.
---
Awesome
---
Also, if I die, please don’t make me spawn out on the street in front of the building.
---
Im not doing daylies anymore. I rather dont buy anything from the atomstore than waisting my time with this crap. Most of these challenges are Impossible for solo players anyways.
---
Probably some bad server lag resulting in objects failing to load. I've had it happen randomly. Walked into a building and found  typewriters and vases floating because the tables never loaded.
---
We could have a DJ from another region where not all people are dead.
---
Healing factor should only work outside of combat so that's possibly just stimpacks there but ye gotta love handmades. One of my friends is doing their best to collect every kind there is?
---
For 5.56 we just take the ammunition factory. It produces quite a bit of ammo in short amounts of time. Idk about shotgun shells. I always have so many that I'm just handing them out.
---
If they fight back.
---
You could make your own doorbell with the switch pylon and a powered speaker maybe?
---
Jesus, I've only seen the damn thing 3 times in over 600 hours. I mean I raise your idea, but I'd say getting the wendigo in a clown outfit, taking it out for dinner, and having a one night stand and then sacrificing it to Todd Howard is more worthy for those 10 atoms than take a pic of a mans ass in a nuke zone.
---
It's an illusion made by the commies
---
If they grief they'll fight back 90% of the time

A whole squad op for 10 atoms doesn’t sound fun, specially for players that don’t like playing with others
---
i hate people who judge other people. wtf dude don´t be a hater
---
If you have the perk card (Class Freak) under the luck cards,it reduces the negative effects of 25%, 50%, 75% respectfully. I have it maxed out an I get only a -13 percent I think to chem effects. It also dropped my negs on marsupial to -1 strength good af perk

Stop blaming people for playing the game. Any problems you have should be addressed to Bethesda.
---
Sounds about heavy enough. Can we dip that unobtanium in lead just to make sure we are hitting our weight requirements for awesomeness.
---
Awesome! :)
---
They at the middle mountain cabins close to whitesprings, 1 out of 3 times. The other spawns are yaogao and honeybeasts. It's not bad with a few server hops.
---
Hope this helps ya raid on brothers!
---
I think itd be cool just to have a stationary creature. Say, you scroll through your menus for "floor decoration" and it's a stationary creature who moves and has sound effects and you can change its name. That would eliminate any NPC problems and give people a cooler way to interact with thier camps :D
---
There's a high capacity mod that gives you 120 carry weight. It requires 8 Possum badges.
---
Bethesda if you are in the vicinity of an event and you are not afk allow for us to all have loot even if we didn't tag them
---
Awarding people with atoms sounds like sketchy waters for legal reasons.
---
&gt;TV shows that couldn‘t be on 10 years ago are very successful today

Was he bloodied? I can kill people in PA very easily with tank killer and and perf mag on my FFR bloodied handmade.

Truth hurts? Buy some more Atom Shop items and you feel better.
---
500 is top dollar if you can charisma, grape mentats, hard bargain,  sweet roll your way high enough

Armor defense isn't worth much alone. There are plenty of ways to get armor-penetration.

Prob a vats crit headshot.
---
Also always crouch in a workshop so you dont show up as a juicy target on the map.

I just want my own pet behemoth, although I’d settle of a mega sloth

I mean I earn 3/4 of my atoms through gameplay but sure why not I’ll buy some on the weekend.
---
Im just in it for the stimpack diffuser, once I get  that im gone
---
? People optimizing builds aren't forcing you to do anything. People optimizing builds aren't making demands or publically shaming people. Your analogy is arguing a point the guy above you never made.
---
Why are you entitled to maximize the amount of legendaries that drop? The enemies are intended to be killed, not kept around for every single person to get a potshot in. The point of the event is to complete the event.
---
You're mad for people playing the game as intended because you don't get to optimize your farming, which isn't what the event is about.
---
You likely arent getting one shot. They are hitting you with a weapon that doesnt use hit scan and the physics are different so by the time you see the 1st shot you are already dead but you were actually hit 5 or 6 times. People accuse me of 1 shotting them all the time because my weapon does this but it actually takes about 5 shots to kill.
---
I have him now on xb1 gt stitch32. Ill be here for 20 mins. Any ammo or cores would be great
---
Right if I wanted a game I had to take photos of wild life everyday I would have went with a Disney game not Bethesda.
---
I wish I could upvote this more
---
Last two events I've done, with 3 people in it, have walked to me with a legendary following them and let me get the chance to hit it. Really appreciated it. Some great players out there.
---
I hope you find a new friend!
---
it‘s always funny in philadelphia, thrones, breaking bad
---
just to name a few
---
Probably should have persevered but I'm to stuck on melee, another time.
---
They arent going to give us an NPC.
---
Probably a bloodied explosive with unyielding armor and the right perks
---
That's not paint friend.... Sorry
---
Good luck out there
---
If you like survival, the insulated and armor backpack mods are very useful.
---
Are mega sloths totally untameable now after patch 9? What can you still tame and are these perks and charisma point just waiting my time and game play?
---
It's an old, old, B.E.T.A. Age bug, I'm desperate for someone @ BGS to let someone help fix the weights of all the weapons and mods
---
That's not the point. The point here is pinpoint map markers are not immersive, fun, or even fair combat wise. Something new is being suggested. I've said literally nothing about caps. And to be quite frank I made 75'000 or more caps before they took the cap loss away so i'm no pve'r. But pinpoint map marking is honestly silly. Should at least be an area marker.
---
I just run to the highest thing around and hide on it until stuff loads in. It sucks, but at least I rarely die by invisible mobs.
---
Give it time to load in. If it’s been more than a minute, hop servers
---
Empathize
---
While I love our existing bot and ai voices I don't think they should be a DJ.  They are parts of the game you develop and unlock, hearing them ahead of time wouldn't be right. 
---
Sure rose already has her own channel but doesn't really do anything with it, plus you do have to unlock it by doing quests for her.
---
I say do what has been going on already and introduce a new voice (robot or otherwise) via new dlc additions.  The radio we listen to already exists somewhere because it streams us music now.  Why can't someone take over the radio station?  This would give us something fresh mixed into our existing radio and not break story, but instead evolve it.
---
Not 100% sure on this but some guy said that with explosive effect you can still one shot since the explosive effect is like after damage or something so technically it's like 2 hits, so if you take someone all the way down to 10% in one hit the explosive effect on the gun can take out the remaining 10% afterwards. If you don't have the fireproof perk then explosive weapons can possibly do 10% of your health
---
Tl;Dr you can take someone to 10% in one hit, explosive effect can finish them off
---
Tell me about it. Stealthboys are annoying. Especially when combod with the vats gun.
---
Nothing was damaged, the wires were 1 wire from generator to machine, machine has power, and only the 4 machines on the 12 power windmill. Adding a new 3 power generator for 1 machine only did nothing. The purfiers and the decon shower are on a separate power circiut with the Fusion generator.
---
Very good invest! Keep up good work!
---
There are random ones that will still attack you, but the majority shouldn't unless you attack them first.
---
Yes conglaturation you’re winner.
---
So can anyone confirm this works for Xbox?
---
LOL, mine is near front, but has a switch
---
Ummmmm explosive weapons arent even OP. I recommend researching PVP and practicing more because it sounds like you don't understand even the half of pvp mechanics.
---
You completed the collector badge challenge? I’m impressed. I seriously doubt I’ll ever find all the magazines needed.

My AA handmade can take down power armor easy. Sentinels not so much.
---
I don't use PA in survival at all.
---
I’m just giving users 5 bucks via paypal for them to buy atoms themselves. If they decide to use it for atoms or not, that is their call. It’s just like those V-bucks giveaways youtubers and streamers do.
---
This isn't for easiess this is for immersion. I want cap loss to come back. Jesus why does EVERY person like you assume I want it easier? No, this system makes it so tryhards dont even have to hunt they just listen to siri tell them where to go because people are marked via pinpoint.

Thanks! I think it's a unique model, it's a motorcycle helmet, I believe. Looks similar to the batting helmet. I own two of the three available skins for the metal armour so I try to use the helmet where I can!

If you're in the vicinity, there's a guaranteed spawn in the raider camp to the west of the Top of the World train station. On the southern side of this camp is a storefront, one of the display cases has it.

---
RNG I've seen no rhyme or reason with my drops. I'll get nocturnal then I'll get two shot then I'll get mutants it's all over the place
---
Healing the Ghoul with a gamma gun... brilliant.
---
I just realized that this photo would be 120% more awesome if I had a chainsaw. So I'm going to find a chainsaw and take another photo
---
Possibly, though it did happen 4 times in a row. Each a single shot at medium range. Apparently he was waiting for me above my stash and I didn't hear him until he fired from above.
---
Thanks for the reply. Hopefully get more information from others. I appreciate it.
---
Shhh the game doesn't know your in combat in PvP. So healing factor is OP AF.
---
**7/10**
---
* The Burrows is a nice little distraction, but it's wayyyyyy too short and easy to plow through. Would be more enjoyable if all the large cities had high-level sewer systems like it though.
---
* I *love* the Sheepsquatch. I want more cryptid quests and lore.
---
* Player Vending &amp; Purveyor Mrmrgh are what keep me coming back every day. Adventuring to refill my stock while trading off excess legendary items is a fun loop IMO. 
---
* I've yet to try the new Project Paradise event, but it looks neat. Been hearing worrying things about it, but we'll see.
---
I haven't done enough spins to test for sure, but it seems like it's seeded and not completely random. The majority of my drops from the purveyor have been either berserker's or anti-armor, and explosive or +10% dmg while aiming
---
Did the same to me during a Queen fight earlier. I had to switch to LMG and then back
---
I soooo wish there was a way to force a Bloodied Explosive drop... but it seems rng :(
---
I'm just throwing this out there because I haven't tried yet, but they implemented herding for the free range event. Has anyone tried herding the friendlies with the herding stick? Could try to herd them all into a room that's easier to defend..
---
Anyone want to try this with me tonight on Xbox?
---
With kills you ended up on the top 3 too for successfully defending yourself.
---
&gt;  It’s been a minute since I’ve checked it, but I thought demolition expert was nerfed as well because of this.
---
You're correct, they changed it so max rank of demo expert gives +60% damage rather than +100% damage to explosives. Other ranks were adjusted as well I believe, but I don't remember the exact numbers.
---
Yeah and like every 4 shots it keeps resetting, very annoying
---
human nature my ass.
---
I just want a Shovel with any \*s for LoLs. But if it was Blood that would be awesome
---
Get a set of Unyielding armor. 1 star is fine, all you care about is the stats boost.
---
Sounds fair enough. But if I where you I would word it differently so it dosent say it's for atoms. 
---
You can suggest they spend it on atoms if you want to but it's really just a cash gift for helping out new players.
---
Thank you SO MUCH for getting my point unlike this triggered asshat lol
---
Two of your three examples are off the air, one for half a decade. I rest my case.
---
I recommend watching final render video on project paradise, he goes through the pros and cons of the event
---
I live near there. I hopped that location ten times. I got zero live scorpions. 
---
Probably because it's a common location for this farming technique.
---
It's just the Stash Goblin. It's fiiiineee! It's one of the many great features this game has to offer. ( ́⋅⃘ˬ̇⋅⃘ ̀ˋ)
---
Yeah, if you didn't have to select the ones you want to track it'd be kinda crazy for the game to track every challenge in that corner.
---
It will probably change with future DLC Nuclear Winter, like we are on autumn yet (Endless halloween week).
---
Every little bit of information helps. Hopefully figure out a pattern to all of it. Or at least get a answer of if it is a list or RNG. Might learn it is better to hit it after server rest or before server rest. Something.  
---
Either way thanks for the info. I appreciate it.
---
I can join you sometime but I think our playtime hours doesn't match? I'll invite you when I see you on. PSN: Cirdloc
---
Lmao you'd be like the Old man neighbor from Home Alone. Taking out the wet bandits with a shovel
---
There are actually perks for it that aren't active.
---
You are right. I should have figured this by myself
---
From my experience there was prob someone else there as well. 
---
They like to travel in packs, and justify what the do as "#justraiderthingz".
---
Barry Burton’s voice “What... is it?”
---
this entire post is about "kill stealing" - nothing about stealing other people's shit, where the hell are you coming from?
---
was more or less agreeing with you people seem to undervalue how well the 5 piece chameleon works yeah did go off on a little bit of a rant really :)
---
Still risky, they pick and turn them back on. Probably better to scrap the wire, saves on budget too.
---
yes, their suggestion is terrible.  it would also lead to people using overpowered attacks MORE, just to make sure they get loot.
---
I’ve been setting my prices at what I would be happy pay. I wish we could set bulk ammo prices. 1c each is too much for a bunch of stuff, especially .38. I’d like to be able to set it to like 1c per 5 or 10 .38, for the new players.
---
I did a round of 5 3* weapons 3 of them had 90% less weight
---
I think they attack if you're teamed up with a player who hasn't done mayor for a day
---
He's talking about things like uranium fever, not the Queen
---
It reads as a "people can steal shit from me, and I can't stop them" post. You can't "steal" event kills unless you oneshot the end boss, which isn't possible with the vast majority of event bosses minus camp fire tales stupid level 16 1 stars.
---
Thanks for the info. Maybe it has something to do with how many we do in a row then. Appreciate the information and your time.
---
We met, I killed you, you killed me, that was a fine day
---
Hello, I submitted a ticket 2 days ago but have had no update. What's the usual response time? It's an issue with the ATOM shop
---
...and create stability issues.
---
Armor becomes less and less effective when you reach higher damage. The way it works is it's a ratio of your armor to the damage dealt, so in order to ignore a high percentage (say above 80%) of damage you need DR about ten times higher than the damage you're taking.
---
A bloodied adrenal nerd rage explosive shotgun can very easily surpass 1000 damage even at long range. At 455 defense, you would still be taking around 600-700 damage. That's not even considering VATS crits, psycho, sneak attack criticals, etc.
---
Yeah, I think you are right, better to play it safe. Thanks for the suggestion, will change it on the next update.
---
I still think it's not unreasonable to have a happy medium. But you're points are still valid. Let's agree to disagree. Happy gaming.
---
Sounds fake
---
If it was just taking a picture of X location then sure, would be an opportunity to explore and come back to certain places ! 
---
But a picture of random things nearly impossible to do that's a no-no !
---
It may effect the usefulness of stim packs, but it dose not affect colas. I use colas for healing as they weight less for me, and a cherry gets me back to full health. I run 2 ranks of cola nut, and 3 of threw hiker
---
Agree with the event, disagree with pre assigned weapons and gear.
---
That's not how it comes across if you read his back and forth with me, he was talking about the "please stop one shotting the legendaries" and being upset that people could join an event and get the rewards even if they don't do anything, and he wants to be able to punish them by killing them for doing so.  
---
Which was my entire point, if you think the "right" action to do when people kill steal like that is to kill their character, then play Survival.
---
Same! I got a instigating one myself but I really need one with swing speed
---
lucky.
---
That's what I was afraid of. It's too bad because it otherwise seems like a nice spot. Thanks for the info.
---
Several times my teammate and I have gotten items with very the same legendary effects in a row. I’ve got two furious in a row. He got two explosive weapons in a row (the bastard). It seems to happen quite often. I’ve noticed it in drops over time too, always seem to get a run of similar effects all at once. One day it was Bloodied, I found 4 bloody weapons in the span of a short time, and then will go a month before I see one again. One day I found every piece necessary to complete an unyielding set from scratch. 
---
It is not totally 100% random. Especially not all effects being having an equal random chance of appearing.
---
Again, what stick? Whats it called?
---
I’ve been throwing all my scrip into getting shovels - I hope you get one soon
---
They could have all kinds of "modes". Even ones where you keep your gear.
---
Never seen it. It's a legend radscorpion or camp councellor nia.
---
Get rid of crops if you have them.  Something about them seems to cause enemies to spawn.
---
Exact scenario happened to me yesterday. I'm hopping servers farming the campfire event at Adams trying to get the smores recipe and in one of them I ended up doing all of it alone until the last second and a level 343 (I'm level 90) comes in and one shot kills the counselor. I didn't get the recipe OR my shitty 1 star for scrip. After that I signed off.
---
That's a good question. I'll have to try work out where he could have been.
---
Well, it wasn't needed for everyone to be involved. It just allowed all of us to check it off our lists. We got some good photos out of it and had fun doing it. One player got her first player kill while we were messing around. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of playing with others, but if you find the right people, it can be fun. In reality, we all play solo...together. If that makes any sense.
---
Riot esk armor all the way. I already rock the drifter outfit, army helmet and gas mask for an NCR ranger look and identify with the free states for the closest thing in the current lore. That being said, you release more gear to what in looking for bethesda, you have my money.
---
one of them gets a netflix movie, and the other one was only the best show on TV and will get several spin-offs. but yeah, rest your case that you never made.
---
Thanks for the info. I appreciate you and your reply.
---
PA is well known to be useless for pvp. As mentioned DR alone will not do much and can be easily mitigated. It's more survival perks/effects that keep you alive.
---
How could one possibly know in a real apocaliptic world where the enemies are in a map? Well, SURVIVAL should mean survival, not Battle Royale.
---
I didn't say anything about NPC
---
U can have a snallygaster pet but not that particular one
---
Anybody notice that glowing mass is 2 lbs. apiece? I did a breakneck double take when i realized i had 80 lbs. of it.
---
And you can tame a sloth too
---
I'm missing a bumblebear and two magazines. Problem is I've been using the perk to find magazines easier for weeks and still haven't found those last two issues. I'm starting to wonder if magazine drops are region locked
---
You can already tame pets to have at your camp this is a feature
---
CAMP plans are red. Weapon/armour plans are green.
---
Is it not a problem that a game with this many bugs has a "skeleton crew" working to fix them?
---
Maybe place the switch behind a locked door? Just an idea.
---
But cant people kill them? I feel like this way, it would be a camp decoration and dont have to worry about NPC navmeshing :p
---
I'd settle for a pipboy holotape that activates a short damage tracker log.
---
If you don’t contribute, why should you be rewarded? It’s debatable if Endangerol even works or not.
---
Had the same problem! Also on xbox, but have yet to resolve the issue :(
---
One shot damage protection works per bullet. Shotgun has pellets aka multiple bullets per shot.
---
Yep! I’ve been grinding out magazines for the past few months in anticipation of one day being able to display a complete collection once they add the ability to display items in your C.A.M.P. From my experience, the magazines required for this challenge are much easier to find than others.
---
Fact is if you dont understand pvp or have a pvp build you will always get creamed. Research it. Even bloodied cant 1 shot anymore, though ive heard rumor vats crits can still 1 shot 50% of the time? Im not sure how it works, but trust me I know formiddable power armor players. You probably just have a dinky build. Bloodied isnt op anymore. A top notch bloody build looses to top notch full health.
---
I found bumblebear right on the side of the main road in the ash heap yesterday.  I believe it was traveling southeast from the rusty pick.
---
I play on both and have honestly never needed them, nor have I needed them playing skyrim on switch. I get what you're saying that some people need them, but not having things to deal with special conditions doesn't make a game unplayable.
---
The development team has different sections, the team that fixes bugs is small. Literally all games have small teams that work on bugs. At least small compared to the different divisions
---
I've done it over 100 times and this is the first I have heard of that. I'm calling bullshit unless someone can prove otherwise.
---
Dammit. I need to find him! I don't even get insultbot anymore. Just prize bot on heavy rotation again.
---
Did you not read the “yes it can” part
---
I'm pretty sure Endangerol isn't shared.  The DR debug only applies to you.
---
+250 damage resistance with reload, the effect that takes the prefix out together with taking the 250 DR when you finish reloading?
---
The trading reddit. They are apoplectic that prices are dropping.

Dammit. I need to find him! I don't even get insultbot anymore. Just prize bot on heavy rotation again

A bench for sitting in a church, only heathens don't know this.
---
My advice is to just keep at it. I visit Toxic Larry’s, Son’s of Dane Compound and then Logging Camp near it, and Sunnytop everyday when I log in to farm magazines. Been at it for the past few months and I need about 10 magazines to have collected them all. Those U.S. Operations Training Manuals are elusive as hell.
---
I just use a powered door with a code, I post the code right next to the key pad. Then put a pressure plate inside. My doors are always shut, and if people can't figure out how to get in that's in them. People can't figure it out more often than you'd think
---
Way to miss the fucking point.
---
I was summoned to camera on the first day and I have never even crafted an unbroken version. I'm not tired of these challanges as I ignore them. The fun ones are those I set myself.
---
Ok guys, purchasing from WS vendor did work, I hadn't tried for the nuka section yet.
---
I had assumed purchasing the items to "collect" for this would not work because I purchased the magazines for the same badge and it didn't count.
---
The only difference that I can see is the colas we're purchased from a game vendor, the magazines were purchased at a vendor.
---
What??
---
Dead before or after you came?
---
It synergises awesomely with one piece of regenerating armor
---
I only roll for 3 star ranged weapons. Seems to be the regular old RNG for me in terms of effects.
---
(I seem to be extremely good at getting pipe revolvers though.)
---
Do you have it on that weapon?
---
I still have that damn thing. For the hilarity of it.
---
I'm not sure exactly what this picture is, or whether or not it inspired it, but there *is* a submerged church in the eastern side of the Mire.
---
Man I wish this were true, even if it is a 1/100 chance.
---
Exactly. Even when you don't try you still end up there.
---
I suggest you go to the miners monument (just south of white spring)  and just server hop until you find the guy with the camera (body is on the steps of the monument)
---
everytime you load, theres 4 easy to kill protectrons, so you'' also be getting scrap/ exp while you do it =)
---
Fuck that gauntlet.
---
Ty, it seems purchasing from WS vendor did work, but this is exactly the answer I was looking for initially.
---
I explain why I asked here before trying to buy in a response to this post.
---
There's a minimal because people tag and then let others do all the work. Gotta do more damage to earn it.
---
Personally, I wish there were limits on events too... Like gotta do damage, gotta grab 1 pylon, gotta kill one enemy... Something to deter leechers from hiding during events too.
---
Yes I do miss people taking one shot at SBQ then hiding in the shed.
---
Even battle royale doesnt pin point locations lol
---
7
---
Can confirm. I feel this on every level.
---
They have stated they are looking into it. It seems to be a console limitation hindering all systems.
---
Yeah i thought about that but I'd have to redesign my camp. It's basically an open floor plan right now. Quick and easy access to everything, including resource collectors for my customers. Just wish was an easy fix. 
---
Someone else suggested a terminal and lock terminal, but thats pointless. All it offers is ability for me to flip all switches at once... anyone can still go and flip them manually. So defeats the purpose. 
---
I also saw a switch with keypad, but also pointless. Seems to only turn power on briefly, like to open a door, not to keep power on indefinitely to the vending machines.
---
I’ll chime in here since I’ve contacted them before regarding the Atomic Shop. When I contacted them a few days before Christmas I think it was they got back to me within an hour. Perhaps submit a new ticket and see if it gets a response quicker.

THREE METALLLLLL
---
The normal tesla fires lighting arcs, the explosive one fires explosive bullets. If you shoot floor of the station from the outside with a regular tesla, whatever is inside dies. If you do it with explosive tesla, probably nothing happens as they won't stand in shooting line from the doors.
---
The good thing about it is that its a powerful rifle, but should be considered a regular "legacy" explosove rifle, not a tesla gun.
---
Contribution shouldn't be determined by damage done alone, there are various effects and debuffs in this game that assist in killing targets. Me switching to the Bleedout Syringer (30 damage over 10 seconds) shouldn't be any more valid than a damage increase against a target for my team. I would consider the damage increase far more useful than the 30 damage on a level 68 Super Mutant.
---
My contribution of assistance, meat-shielding, healing, and otherwise should be good enough to be considered " contributing ".
---
I have a video on xbox... Dookiestorm.. it's on Fallout 76 video club or Fallout 76 picture club... I put it on both of em
---
I'd rather loose my junk than other people be able to grab it at events. So sick of these assholes in nukezones and cryptids.
---
I like the way Snrub thinks!
---
when you start with yes it can and then continue with a comment about harpoons, it could be misleading.
---
Not anymore they can't as long as you are set to passive
---
I'll be on tonight after about 10 Eastern Time. Dockuwan.  We can knock out both revives if you want. I've done it on one of my toons but not the others.
---
Argh! So basically I’ve bought a broken Tesla! :-(
---
Thanks for the clarification dude, very much appreciated, a little sad now, but I’m sure it’ll have its uses!
---
Vats - combat rifle. Raw power - handmade. Lever is also very nice. Railway has surprisingly low vats cost. Laser explosive rifles are awesome at long ranges, too awesome perhaps.
---
I had a response from Ladyvann telling me that they were aware of the situation and trying to solve the problem.
---
all my uranium fever experience were favorable people wait for the rest to tag them, but in other events like campfire tales the legendary is weak i can't tag him fast enough between all those bugs flying around to get the loot, fukboi PA chad just one shot the legendary :V
---
It could have been some perk choices. It's not easy to transition from melee to rifle. It's really a different special distribution.
---
Not as tired as I am off the posts complaining about them... 
---
Once I realized I was doing a bunch of stuff I didn't want to do for the equivalent of $0.10 in atoms I stopped doing challenges unless they sounded particularly fun or stupidly easy. 
---
Just do ones you want to and don't do ones you don't want to.
---
All games with images that players can upload and show end up full of porn and nazi images.
---
Trust me, its a bad idea
---
You by any chance have a 2nd plasma gatlin (doesnt matter if regular or legendary)? Pretty sure their was some bug a while back with conflict between 2 of same weapon. As of last update, I've seen several old bugs resurface.
---
You know what would be awesome: the Mr. Handy occasionally addresses when a player does something and, if it's within the list, uses the character's name to identify them. "Mr. Buttface has taken workshop X."
---
The first time I went shopping, I ended up with these three, in this order:
---
Mutant's Metal Chest Piece (+10 DR &amp; ER when mutated, +1 PER, junk items weigh 20% less)
---
Mutant's Metal Chest Piece (+10 DR &amp; ER when mutated, +1 INT, increases lock pick sweet spot)
---
Mutant's Wood Chest Piece (+10 DR &amp; ER when mutated, +1 INT, junk items weigh 20% less)
---
So your old photos just... disappeared?
---
Don't worry, while not a tesla its still an interesting legacy gun, valuable too, you can also sell it for something here if PC :) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQtVq5bhcQXaRwKHrfSrlyHlu2lYlzwMJcYrrqmrorc/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
I don't know how long it took the game to realize I completed the quest, but it wasn't for several days, maybe weeks that the robots stopped attacking me.
---
PS4 here, I think I’ll keep hold of it for a while, you never know when you see a nice trade!
---
I get their stance, the free atoms were cutting into their profit margin (vs the non-functioning game or anything). But the fun challenges kept people coming back for more, putting them into the habit of playing the game daily. These new challenges are just nonsense and do nothing to encourage any repeat players
---
same deal.  the assholes arent 1shotting the sheepsquatch, just the weaker stuff
---
Messaged you! Again, really appreciate it
---
Its still a very strong negotiating card even if you upfront say how it works to potential buyer.
---
But where tho
---
That sounds like a made up statistic
---
Bloodied unarmed with adrenaline and
---
Well i have not seen one, but 2 three star legendaries have dropped plain old regular drills
---
I've done a few 2 star armor and the ones I've done in a row have been assassins gear, then the next 3 star weapon was an assassin also.
---
NOT Biv. Biv is so freaking annoying. I spam E on him just so he'll hurry up and give me the daily so I can GTFO of there and not have to listen to him anymore.
---
Sometimes I'm still a bit festive [https://imgur.com/Itoze5V](https://imgur.com/Itoze5V), but always comply. Hail Enclave.
---
Once you find it you'll find them all over the place. I can probably get you a broken one if you haven't found one.
---
Yes, hoping so, I do have a regular Bloodied Tesla also, so I’ll start using that instead, would you also recommend modding with an automatic barrel?
---
Oh yeah, real tired of that shite. I lose a lot of enemies in the weeds to! They should make a mentat  that also finds dead bodies. Berry mentat for the living, and a melon mentat for the dead. And you can stack them. I’d have to roll a junkie build.
---
Hey this person made a comment in a secondary language about their thoughts. Talking online is a great way for them to improve and share a different perspective. Theyre doing great, and we are a part of their learning experience.
---
My camp is unlocked, everything is open. I even have a stage with a few instruments to let visitors play...

Maybe that the option also. Do a 2\* if it is not the roll you want then stop and hold until tomorrow. Then if it is the roll you want you hit that 3\*.

---
Abso-fucking-lutely, I had a Q 1* tesla on PvP character with 0 related perks (bloody mess the only one that applied) and it shredded people. Bloodied has to be more precise due to 1/4 of quads magazine, but it shreds faster.
---
If three players are hitting the scorchbeast queen with TSE Heavy guns and you’re plonking away at it with a syringe, I don’t think you should get anything for that. They are doing the work, not you. Their ammo costs more than your stimpaks or syringes. If you want a reward, do damage. If you want to rp as medic, do that. But I don’t think there should be both, or low levels would abuse it to get loot they don’t deserve.
---
I’m guessing you’re exploiting the pistol cards too, huh?
---
I finally got this. I took about 10 photos of subjects, dead or alive, in the rain(as people have stated) and none of them worked until the last one. I don't know why it didn't work the other 9 times, but the final one was a living Scorched Champion. I waited until the readout said it was a scorched enemy(which I had done several times before and it finally worked.
---
I always wanted to try that and see if it worked like that. I once tried a bloody one and that didn't go so well lol
---
a radio update would not go amiss
---
the items are the same each time even if they don't have the diamond you can always still go pick them all up the one that people miss all the time is the pet rock.
---
Bam. 
---
You're always going to have lazy-asses and ne'er-do-weller-vault-dwellers. Any mechanic that punishes 90% of players to prevent the 10% of lazy asses is objectively bad.
---
Haha, you’ve sold it to me! Thanks man!
---
Maybee with melee.
---
So obviously the problem here would be the voice acting, right? I mean, Bethesda will no doubt add events and other announcements over the lifetime of the game, calling a voice actor back to record the new lines every time they want to do an update is probably not a workable solution. Too time-consuming, too expensive. 
---
HOWEVER, if I may humbly add to your idea- why not use a text-to-speech synthesized voice? The mispronunciations and lack of emotion inherent in synthesized voices would be amusing and memeworthy, not to mention thematically appropriate.
---
Just my two caps.
---
I can't tell if you're being deliberately dense or you actually believe what you're saying, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
---
Rather than quibble on absolute definitions of terms that are bandied about, I will say this.   People who play in *multi*player games without any empathy or understanding of others playing are detrimental to the gaming community as a whole.

I'm speaking of non-special events, such as general mobs and enemies you meet in locations. Specific instances of end-game bosses that take 10-15 minutes for a group to kill is something entirely different.

Until they implement legendary power armor pieces PA is a bad. Bad thing to wear in PVP.

Yes, we actually did look on those bodies there, plus their refuse piles in the area.  A teammate is the one looking for one of the scout challenges, but 3.5 of us (one part-time player) have been looking since the scout challenges started and have not seen one.  As I understand it, it's a bug?

In my experience, player generated is *always* the best content.
---
That was a whole lot of words to say "WAAH CASUALS HAVING FUN IN MY HARDCROE GAEM WAAH."
---
I’d give you a fair amount of caps for that
---
&gt;-Vats/melee no damage but is back. The no damage bug also effects my handmade when not in vats. Direct shooting several critters (mole rats and mongrels) registered no hits.   
---
Smacked a 3 star mutie with my axe 6 times last night, didn't do a thing. The 7th hit finally registers and he drops a drill LOL
---
Most of us are tired for camera challenges. Bethesda isn't very innovative when it comes to create new and interesting challenges.
---
Oh ok, I understand what you mean now - a collection of all known recipes/plans you could access at any time.
---
Thank you so much for posting this. Worked like a charm!
---
I am still encountering intermittent crashes when consuming an item from the Pip-Boy interface. It seems to happen most frequently with alcohol and crafting plans. Nothing conclusive, but I'm leaning towards it being related to things that trigger either a message in the top-left corner of the screen or a challenge progress toast notification.
---
Right now the refrigerated backpack stack with lvl 2 good with salt. The effect is really noticeable. My cranberry relish can last almost 12 hours rt. I only do the cranberry run every other day now.
---
They had Lincoln's Repeater in Fallout 3, which was a .44 lever-action rifle. Maybe add a .44 receiver for those.
---
Oh man that sucks. But hey one of the weekly challenges is to kill a critter with a drill haha.
---
the limit is especially low because you have to recycle the garbage it gives you.
---
Noticed the same thing, bloodied has the same damage as zealot's, no matter how low my health was. Logged out and back in, the number were correct again. Played a little check again, dropped back to non-bloodied level. Just really annoying to have bugs like these.
---
I like that idea.  I would participate for sure.  And you could tag their 'gamer card' with group invites so if you get a blind invite, at least you'll see their rating...  I'm liking this more and more.  Jerk players will end up ostracizing themselves.
---
Honestly, the only parts of this community that i've met that are pretty bad are the Blammers...
---
People with overpowered weaponry who attend events, and one shot the legendary, essentially robbing everyone of their chance at getting either something good, alright, or scrip fodder  for the purveyor.
---
Even someone like me who /is/ a heavy weapons AND explosives build; I'd consider any missile launcher a meme weapon even with 90% reduced weight.
---
My two shot auto grenade launcher pumps out much better burst and sustained DPS and the ammo weighs less.
---
It might be worth something to someone who is just looking to have some fun with a underutilized weapon; but until Bethesda overhauls explosive weaponry to be far more potent, it'll always be a last pick.
---
Hmm, that's a good idea.  I carry a crappy Anti-Armor one on me (jury is out on whether or not the AA effect even applies), so that might be a use for it.
---
Yep, you can tell it's been a while since I've played survival ;-)
---
Oh they're meant to, it just doesn't work sometimes
---
Fair enough. I figured with those rolls it's valuable to someone out there rather than just dump it as scrip.
---
Found 'mine' in Graninger Farm.
---
You could get around 40 scrip for it and save up to get another legendary
---
_extremely_
---
Thru-Hiker... They became negligible
---
This isn't what happens with the bug. All the items get picked up but one or more don't register.
---
i only locked my acid extractor behind a door, everything else in my basic bitch house can be explored and used
---
Oh man, I hope those policing don't visit my vending machines.  Anything I choose to sell is essentially, to me, by definition, worthless.  If I was going to use it, I wouldn't be selling it.  If it were two weeks ago, I'd be trotting off as those items materialized in a paper bag behind me.
---
And I set my prices to reflect this.  They are tagged to move, not push the margins of an imaginary consumer tolerance.
---
You must be lucky because I check out every vendor I see and people never have any god roll stuff for sale at all, not even for 10K caps. It's always mid tier stuff, and I've picked up some decent stuff for cheap but never great stuff. All the great stuff I find I got from drops. Player vending is pretty picked clean compared to how it was in the first couple days. Not many people are still emptying mules. I think most are filling their vendor with stuff they just got.
---
Armor (10/0) would indicate "10 armor for sale, none of them are legendary", Armor (10/3) would indicate "10 armor for sale, 3 are legendary"
---
Fits in the little popup menu, can be done w/ existing text, augments existing interface very well.
---
I thought about this, but I wonder if there isn't some...flexible math going on that they don't really want to advertise in hard numbers?
---
This is doable on PS4 easily too, just hit the share button and screenshot it. 
---
Only thing I don’t like about doing this is the pictures you’ve deleted are just saved to your harddrive, they don’t show up as loading screens.
---
if you have every day at least 2 camera challenges, multiple pictures in weekly challanges, camera incorporated into the scout badges, it's forced literally everywhere. It's no surprise to me
---
&gt;&gt;Bullet sponges are NOT A MECHANIC
---
&gt;People complain a lot about (omg this person just one shoted the &gt;insert mob here&lt;) which is why they probably added this
---
It's trivial to add some health gating to boss enemies. say, 25% 50% and 75% That way, it can't take less than 4 )or more, depending on how many gates you add hits) to kill a boss, regardless of the incoming damage.
---
After that, then you can reduce the sponginess of enemies like the SBQ, who takes a solid 15 minutes of a full server of average players shooting at her
---
Bird bones is pretty great for VATS builds, it's the only mutation I run.
---
I'd build that.
---
Same. Updated my first ticket from a while ago asking for an update and it’s gone unresolved for a couple of weeks now.
---
Don't forget to preach about sex junk oh oh oh
---
The Top of the World area.
---
The balcony that - if you lack marsupial - you need to climb on the hedges and then on the ladder to access, to your left as you climb from the train station can spawn one on the table at the end.
---
The balcony on the back in the building where the robot vendor, another one on the table, next to the cooler.
---
The cabins down the road, many spawns, equip the relevant perk. Found five there this evening.
---
You can just server hop that area if the ones that spawn are not the ones you are after or if the place has been 'picked clean' already.
---
Plenty of stuff to kill too.
---
I am around 100 3* armor rolls. I am leaning more towards seeding (with rng). If I see a nocturnal I hop servers. If I see an unyielding I turn in all on that server. Warning: anecdotal.  I would need 10k rolls to validate this.
---
Yeah, I wonder too.. No Info since december..
---
Definitely not. The game still needs tuning and general tweaking, but the event itself works just fine.
---
Plasma gatling? I was talking about a gatling gun. Though i do have a plasma gatling and a second gatling gun but both are in my stash
---
I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it here before, but I would love player controlled radio stations
---
I remember i went to my camp once, half of everything destroyed, brahmin killed, deathclaw's body in water.
---
Found albino deathclaw where a dropped cargobot crate was (seems ro be a random spawn too, before a truck crab attacked) between the watoga workshop (forgot name) and the watoga forest north of watoga power station.
---
dont bulk your steel
---
Thx u/Herkus! Good news!
---
Yeah i do have +250 dmg resistance on that gun, why is that an issue?
---
I think a simple fix would be to separate the boss from the final wave of enemies. Complete three waves of normal enemies, *then* spawn the boss. It's hectic enough to have to chase them down and keep enemies off of them while they try to hide, but when they run straight towards the elite and get one-shot, it's just stupid. 
---
Maybe change up the requirements so all you have to do is protect them during the normal waves, then have them run off to safety or "mutate" and take considerably less damage once the boss spawns.
---
This idea needs more "MODUS After Midnight," a la Delilah After Dark
---
I belive to op has glad many rad beans and the exhaust from the jet pack has ignited the vapor.

My instigating Combat Shotgun isn’t working correctly, either. I know I’m the first person to hit certain targets, and I’m definitely hitting for half of what I was.

I had the same glitch with the Cave Cricket camera picture, the name tag thingie showed up for me on the top-right corner, but still didn’t count towards my challenge. I tried taking another picture of the same one, didn’t work either. Killed another random Cave Cricket and took a picture all fine, didn’t do anything different other than taking a picture of a different Cricket. My guess is that the camera challenges can be (rarely but can still happen) sometimes glitched.
---
What platform are you on? I’d buy it
---
Even those of us who've had a camera since day one hate them. As a solo player, I have never gotten any of the "Take a Camera Picture of a Player &lt;doing some random thing&gt; &lt;in some dumb location&gt; while &lt;something highly unlikely is happening&gt; with a &lt;something that would never even appear in that location&gt;" challenges. I don't have teammates to beg to humiliate/endanger themselves, and no random stranger is going to strip naked and engage in PVP in a nuke zone just because I asked them to.
---
Ya, that's the downside. Hopefully they get this out sooner rather than later. But supposedly they are working on expanding it.

*Sarcastically* You're welcome.

Yeah I'm sure it's fixed and we won't need to rebake the lighting ever again. Glad we're over this whole lying in every patch notes thing, smooth sailing from here on out!

&gt; that no one noticed

Yeah, kinda the point i was trying to make... stealth patches come in all forms.
---
Damn. I’m pc. Have fun with it.
---
Junkies guns sell extremely high?  Why?

Thanks I'll try the
---
Can confirm, explosive Radium Rifles will do the same.
---
Either way, that's badass.
---
You guys deserve to get paid for doing their work for them.
---
Dailies suck. I somehow always manage to get 2-4 weeklies by accident; the one thing I still deliberately seek out is the 30-40 atoms for taking a specific workshop. I find a server with that workshop open, take it, then immediately quit to main menu and server hop so I'm not open to PVP for too long.
---
Upvote because Amortentia reference.
---
I didn't read it all but the mammologist was bugged for me and I changed the name of the camera and that worked
---
Dear god. A mr. Gutsy with explicit language thats a radio host.... that'd be the holy grail.
---
I had it not work on one corpse, and I moved it a bit with explosives and the picture worked. (The name was showing in the upper righthand corner even when it wasn't working.) You could try that on the off chance I was temporarily experiencing your problem and it helped.  I think it may be much more likely I was slightly in the wrong zone, though.
---
They've been working for me. If any more info helps- I have 1 camera in my inventory, it's modded with the 105 lens and painted with the white croc paint. It's favorited. Xbox. My photo album is full and I don't bother clearing it.

Saving this post. Been hunting to optimize it for automatic use and its eluded me since release.

For the life of me I can never remember their actual name, it escapes me ever since my younger brother said they’re like powered nipples.
---
I love those snakey boys
---
Yeah, I have to sit there and let the invisible enemies load anyways (while I take damage and pop stimpacks), why don't they just load the whole thing while I look at all the dumb pictures they made me take.
---
Yup same here
---
Is it sad that I'd take payment in lost junk? (like 1900 steel/900 lead last night!)
---
All I can do is prime and screw making prime ammo
---
Sometimes it takes time for enemies to spawn in visually after loading in to Arktos and when respawning yourself. 
---
It does suck that enemies bodies disappear but keep in mind that the encrypted event boss is a robot and will show up as a pile of metal which is impossible to differentiate between the others that show up after the event. 
---
Sorry for your troubles.
---
Not me, because the 23rd of October is my bday, so every day I can celebrate in the wasteland.
---
And are you on here complaining about other people pricing things too low?
---
As important as it is to learn when to listen, I hope y'all are also learning when *not* to listen. Fact is, these guys don't even know what they want. "EEH YOU NEED TO NERF TSES" to "EEH WHY DID YOU NERF TSES," "EEH THE BURROWS IS TOO LOW-LEVELLED" to "EEH ARKTOS IS TOO HIGH-LEVELLED," "EEH THERE'S ONLY ONE RAID BOSS" to "EEH THERE'S TOO MANY RAID BOSSES"... Even if you included every idea here, they'd just moan about being forced to use syringers instead of their 20 000 damage Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlets.
---
Except the server-wide alert. Add that. And one for Free Range, too.

As the person noted below (and they're not the only one, search reddit if you want) but for people who do experience nausea, it's literally unplayable as stated.
---
Let's not be so myopic and self-centred and think well just because I don't experience, it's not a problem. Low FoV isn't a problem for me either but I at least can recognise it was for other people.
---
&gt;They could have delayed launch 2 years and there would still be bugs, so why not release and fix them as they come up like they said they were going to?
---
This is textbook apologist. I didn't want to say you were one, thinking you wanted to be measured but you're not. You are one of those blind fanboys. You're part of the problem dude.
---
I'm not saying you have to be ultra negative or hate on bethesda or the like. At least acknowledge the problems in a representative way. 
---
I don't hate Bethesda and I still play the game to this day. However, let's not pretend that they were not deserving of the severe backlash that the game received. The reason why most of the Bethesda fanboys e.g. MrMatty, Cohhcarnage, ManyATrueNerd etc. have turned their back on the game and maybe Bethesda as a whole wasn't because of "outrage culture". You know what the reason is. It's pretty self-evident, even if you refuse to acknowledge it.

Often overlooked are buses and trains. Most of them have a dead soldier sitting next to a mil ammo bag.

I have a rifle build. I just like options
---
Or maybe you're the dense one improperly using a term without understanding what it really means? 
---
And empathy and understanding? You're mad because you don't get to exploit the game mechanics as much as possible to get drops you want. 
---
You're the one demanding somebody change a build, playstyle, and not use certain weapons so you can get a couple of more drops when the objective is to *complete* the event, not farm it for items. Don't like it? Complain to Bethesda. They made events and mechanics specifically this way.
---
that one place in Fraternity Row should have em

No I finally got my camera yesterday lmao.

Some ppl are locking their power switches in a main hub room cuz some jerks are going around and purposely turning off ppl's power to their vendors.

Server hopped for two hours and still havent found the camera. So done with this.

I know this is a days old post but the new thing to do is set up camps that lure people in with a shop, and trap them and kill them. With the new change there is no recourse short of nuking their base. I used to agree with you, but this persons camp deserves to be destroyed.
---
The lack of deathclaw hides needs to be addressed still.  Deathclaws no longer seem to drop hides and it's extremely rare to find hides in the wild and makes it hard to complete the leatherworker challenge.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out.
---
Another post about this just a few minutes ago.
---
Bethesda has stated they are looking into this. It's a console limitation affecting all versions of the game.
---
Can only wait.
---
I've seen rare offers of 5k+ on market for low level pieces. That being said, this is a mid level piece, so id say 2k or 3k
---
Finding the Teddy Bears was barely an inconvenience compared to the magazines and the wretched Deathclaw Hides for Leatherworker.
---
I was done with that in 30 minutes flat without having to server hop.
---
I set my ammo at 0 caps. I feel bad selling an item that's everywhere for free.
---
I can't even find the npc to get the camera, so at least you have that :P

I like to pair healing factor with carnivore and hotbar glowing meat steaks.  while in battle, I use the steak as my main means of healing and only use stimpaks if "oh crap" moments.  Outside of battle, it will heal you up very quickly.  Using that method of eating meat steaks (paired with the carnivore perk) makes stimpaks not required except for extremely daunting events (impostor sheepsquatch).  I don't use much stims during the queen at all.
---
That gun rocked.
---
Having a lever-action .44 makes more sense to me than a .45, like what is in there now.  Plus, Combat Rifles are .45 so it's a tad redundant ammo use wise.
---
I set my ammo at 0 caps I feel bad selling something that is free everywhere.
---
Oh absolutely. I found parts of it very enjoyable and actually feel bad that some really awesome stories and lore (looking at you Order of Mysteries) will be lost to a lot of Fallout fans because of the issues. 
---
That's part of the frustration with the game. If a small handful of gameplay mechanics were handled differently and there was a longer and more open beta period (like maybe 3-6 months as is typical for a lot of betas) it would have been received much better than it was. 
---
Why do you think there are so many "is the game good now" posts? People want to love this game.
---
Take a picture of mothman in a porta-potty while naked and on chems in a nuke zone in survival mode at full health with no rads while carrying 50 stable violet flux, for 10 atoms.
---
10 cents for all that work, sounds like sweatshop labor. 
---
Personally, I only do 1 or 2 of the challenges now, they are not fun and just dumb time wasting tasks. And then I have most of what I want and camp budget can't fit any more anyway.
---
Having two of the same type of weapon favorited throws the game for a loop and causes a bunch of weird behaviors, but mostly unequipping and swapping. Usually both for me.
---
Or they could simply use in-office talent. Someone who already works for the company, and could be payed for routine VO work.

Thanks!! Really appreciate it
---
yeah the shopping cart turrets. they showed up in FO4. It would be pretty cool if we got those for out camps along with the wall-mounted turrets
---
I haven't even gotten a camera agh
---
I enjoyed the Lowe questline the most. And I do love the backpacks and the idea of challenges to complete for currency to buy special cosmetics and plans that have interesting uses.  The story, plots, lore stuff could be a lot beefier and robust. It is pretty watered thin. In a game like this, the quests and story and choices are most important to me, so that's why I'll rate it about a 6/10.
---
They fixed the workshop pvp thing, you can now safely take a workshop and then abandon it without having to server hop to avoid pvp.
---
You get a wendigo camp counselor lvl 22 if you nuke shes goes up 22 lvls
---
You can still loot the imposter sheepsquatch. You can randomly start looking at ground in area it died untill you stumble upon it's invisible body or you can take out your camera and scan the area. Camera will identify it and then you can more easily loot it. While annoying, just because it went invisible doesn't mean it's actually gone.
---
As far as invisible enemies, sometimes it takes a while to load. Especially when trying to load into an area with a lot going on.
---
I've been able to attack and kill invisible enemies before, i just start swinging my axe around until i land a hit. 
---
Sucks, but i make due... worst case, just server hop. Usually the more severe issues are isolated to server.
---
I've actually been looking for this exact weapon. How much do you want for it? How's 5k?
---
Well sorry not sure what to do good luck
---
I'm not wild about taking impossible pictures of players in space suits fighting aliens or naked players in a nuke zone, but I enjoy the "take pictures of 10 creatures in the Ash Heap", and sometimes you meet interesting people when you stand in the Burrows with a clown suit and they thank you for being there as a photo opportunity.
---
Try filing a ticket through the Bethesda website. The people I've talked with are really helpful.
---
2/10 - more poor communication, more bugs, shitty booze quests, shitty camera challenges, par for the apathetic and unprepared course Beth has laid out for us.
---
Thanks for the tip. I got in,  the event started, then it just bugged out and disappeared 🙂 so fun
---
I can hop on for the next few hours
---
I've always thought that the lever action [should use .44](https://www.henryusa.com/rifles/big-boy/) by default.  We have 2 rifles that use 5.56, and 3 that use .45, but nothing that uses. .44.
---
Np

I think this your experience is pretty respresentative. Griefers have to work MUCH harder to grief in Adventure mode. Aside from that, everyone was as nice as they always have been.
---
This is a pretty awesome community as online games go.
---
I didn't read all the replies... but Rose or the enclave would be better choices, or maybe a station for each of Appalachia's factions ... rose already has a radio station, lets get it together bathesda, brotherhood radio relay (relay radio?) signal (camp venture, watoga?), enclave communications expansion (repurpose the national radio astronomy research center), maybe a lost plan to reprogram fluffy for communication (morgantown airport or any relay tower or they could all use the relay towers, wasnt that the overseer's point 'working together') , or a quest to power up a free states communication network (Harper's ferry with the relay towers maybe even make all those orange ham/cb radios more than just pretty decorations) ... and some new music, some old timey mountain music, blues, big band, jazz, jokes, news, etc ...
---
Update your game.
---
I gotta laugh at the folks who talk like there was no thievery in human history until Fallout 76 came along
---
The Firebreather building near Belching Betty usually T-51b for me. 
---
And just as a little protip, level 50 T-51b has higher resistances than level T-60, or even ultracite. Actually, level T-51b is only bested by the X-01. So I’d be looking for max level instead of 30.
---
5k sounds fair to me. But, I'm currently at work. Send me a message on xbox and we can set something up. Gt: Explozive Force.
---
ok, I'm just building on my camp for a bit before I need to do dinner.
---
Ignore youtubers.
---
I have read on here some people say that having two cameras in their inventory prevented camera challenges from registering. If you have two camera try dropping one.
---
My game is updating and will take 8 minutes. I can get on later though.
---
You can get the hard lemonade plans from my vending machine ...
---
My display name on Bethesda.net is different than what shows on the Xbox. So I'm gonna say it does not.
---
Same thing happened with Alcohol challenges. I'd be ok if they had one a day at most and they never required another player.
---
I was going to ask the for the same thing. I don’t mind waiting longer if the alternative is being killed by invisible enemies.
---
Gamma gun should work on any "Glowing" creature too, right? Don't they get healed from Radiation?
---
The Glowing Deathclaw would do well with a Radiation Medic.

i don't need log that quickly :D
---
Your only chance at this is to lurk at Bog Town for however many hours it takes Grahm to circle the map and get to you.  You might be able to get him at Gorge Junkyard, but he crosses the very edge of the workshop boundary so you'll have to time the shot perfectly.
---
Yeah this is why I spend a lot of time playing in the Forest and Toxic regions lately. I've been clearing out the challenges for killing 76 scorched with various types of weapon and it's been a blast wiping the floor with mobs of \~20 scorched with a pipe rifle like they killed my favorite dog.

You won the game congrats!
---
I had a guy do that.
---
I started following him everywhere asking to be my friend.
---
He would fast travel to get away.  I would fast travel to catch up.  I just wanted to be his friend so bad.  Eventually he hopped servers.  
---
But I think he got the message.
---
I got my fairly quickly on my second character by fast travelling between Philippi Battlefield Cemetery, Prickett's Fort, Palace of the Winding Path and Colonel Kelly Monument. They are all next to each other, so it only costs like 2-4 caps to fast travel between each one. After doing a circuit, server hop. I found it after 3 server hops at Philippi and about 40 caps.
---
Yeah and I told him what to do to improve and better share a perspective.
---
I was going to do that with somebuntil I realized I'd be losing out on the purchase price. Not losing caps overall, but missing out on the 350 purchase price in earnings from the vendor. Spend 350 to make 500. Nah.
---
Do i have only 1 ticket?
---
One of the rare "let me tell you what's wrong" sort of posts that is well reasoned and has a solid logic to it.

I was afraid that after the initial period that this could be unplayable and it seems like that just might be without some changes.

I saw a super mutant using a terminal at Harper's ferry today. I sat there atop a train car and just laughed for a while before I blew his head off.
---
Same for me.... I spent over an hour hopping servers to look for rad scorps at the cabins. Zero. Most of the time was bears and corpses of bears.
---
Bethesda doesn't reply about bug reports until they fix them in the patch notes. If you had ever done that instead of constantly shitposting on reddit, maybe you'd already know that because they explicitly say that after you report a bug.
---
I'm actually about to do that, honestly... like when am I gonna use ammo I never use in my guns? I'll just make my own at that point. I'm about to make a post about it
---
You're safe as long as you take the workshop in stealth and immediately fast travel out.  From what I understand, PvP lurkers can't just contest from anywhere in the zone and sucker punch you anymore.  I think you have to agree to contest it now.
---
It's been asked several times.  No updates.  Someone had an email from Bethesda requesting confirmation of shipping address a few weeks ago, as he had hand written the address and it wasn't very clear.
---
Looking forward to it, but not holding my breath.
---
This would be awesome!
---
No you can file as much as you want. It's basically you just stating a problem then an employee reaches out to you and talks walks you through fixing it.
---
Got the same set up! Although I have the Marquee arrows pointing to the code, really is amazing the number of people who don't get it, might be something in the water...
---
Only in hipfire
---
I presume you've been doing this a while (at least I've seen these posts for a while).
---
What are your thoughts on the bug management? Are they winning the way by getting rid of more than they're creating? Are we seeing fewer major bugs?
---
I hope we can eventually bulk ammo it will sell better.
---
Speaking of annoying challenges, does anyone know the specific clothing items that count as sleepwear?  I'd MUCH rather wear pajamas than a crusty pederast clown suit while leveling up.
---
If you mean am I tired of camera based challenges, then no. I like the camera and carry it all the time. Its just the ridiculous conditions for the pictures that I don't like. If they dump those along with any challenges requiring other players (friend or foe) to complete then I'm good.
---
I have one of these.  I keep it for using up missles because its a great launcher.  
---
I dont ever plan on getting rid of it.   Sometimes you just want to launch a bunch of missles at something. 
---
I have the exact same star perks on mine TS, 90% reduced and 33% VATS.
---
Yeah reavers used to be one of those "oh SHIT" enemies in Fallout 3 and now they're one of those "whew it's only a level 22 I can just ignore it till it goes away".
---
Did it actually work? Like you saw his hp bar went back up after you hit him with the gamma gun? I thought it kills regular ghouls but heals glowing ones.
---
You'd still probably get a 3 star drop from the crowned boss of a mob that size. I got a 3 star weapon drop in flatwoods once from a mob of about 25 ghouls.
---
Agreed, i get tied of old drunky ... i only stop by for the recipes anymore. I think he should do tattoos too. And maybe something other than face tattoos, wtf bathesda. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love old bivvy ray (i know Biv E. Ridge. A simple mondegreen and i heard Bivvy Ray. I like Bivvy Ray better), but i can only take so much.
---
I’d stash it and hope for a buff one day
---
Nice!
---
TLDR; This isn't a problem for most players, thusly f\*ck anyone not in the majority. Thanks for your insight!
---
I understand you want more free atoms but maybe it will be more fair to title these posts "BGS, I don't care that you even offer a way to obtain in game currency for free..... I want more of it and it to be easier"
---
Heck yeah! I've thought about that a couple times too and would love that so much.
---
Patch 9
---
Cause we're running on a scripting system from the friggin 90's
---
That's what I do. I dump heavy stuff like missiles and mini nukes, but all the regular ammo goes in my vending machine for free.
---
Better than an ugly terminal to place in your camp.
---
Windmills on rugs still work, it's quite strange
---
I miss having to run from my life as it rained radioactive, exploding tumors. Now it's just 'on no, I'm surrounded by rotten slappy boys'. I mean, yes, the Gengrenous and Glowing one's deal extra poison/radiation damage, but they all have the exact same attacks and movement (and after a point the same HP if you've got a decent weapon/build). I want some variety!!!
---
The cross "cleave" from all the pellets explosions
---
I don’t own a one x but just the xbone I have heard from people that have both say that the game runs better in the one. Lucky me I guess. The one came out before the age of designed obsolescence invaded the console world.
---
This complaint is so meta it hurts
---
*Meet the Medic intensifies*
---
Messaged you
---
If you’re right then how did they load the game to begin with?
---
I'm fairly certain the Purveyor update added new legendary effects no?
---
And there's the new awesome bear arm
---
I only leave the mission im following showing on the map.. I turn off tracking for anything Im not pursuing...
---
I haven't seen one either but I haven't really been looking. Since they fixed the 200% repair buffs to damage, vfast weapons haven't really been viable...
---
Though maybe a furious drill might change my mind.
---
Psycobilly stuff ... maybe some hard core punk(something that sounds like it was played on a war drum and a guitar sword), maybe just some incoherent screaming and dissonance ... oh, you silly raiders.
---
The "cross cleave" from explosive shotgun pellets....like 6 to 8 people are saying....is was makes them soo deadly
---
I think they nerfed the armor. I noticed it a d ago did my friends did too.
---
I will! I can get on within 5 minutes
---
The prime combat reciever is .44. Not intentionally, but it is.
---
Do you play on PS?
---
I never use .45 but I pick up a crap load of it when I Farm WS. I sell it at my camp machines and easily get up to 1k every two days or so (but granted, I Farm a LOT).
---
We're in the Falloutlands now. Or we will be once we get to be actual Vault Hunters with the raid DLC.
---
Yes I do
---
I'm on Xbox but love this.
---
I jumped to Project Paradise, walked into the big room and was killed by who knows how many invisible enemies. Guess I'll try that shit next patch....
---
Thanks for the upvote! I am totally an introvert, but I have a job that requires me to be an extrovert so playing solo in Fallout helps me decompress. I never thought about it, but that’s probably a big part of what I enjoy about it. That said, I’d like to think I’m approachable and friendly so I do like making contact with people once in a while. But I also stress about letting people down... so I stress the team thing because I suck as a combat player. Whoa... Do I owe you some caps for that psychiatry session?
---
Might as well just do that now ... what's your psn and what time will you be there?
---
I saw a scorched sneaking. Yes sneaking. Clip is on my xbox profile. TheHummingArrow

I never go for PVP. Hate it with a passion. I really should have left well enough alone, but I admit I got pissed and wanted my stuff back after he ambushed me in my own workshop. Had just spent a half hour harvesting flux and he waited til I had converted it before attacking.

I would much rather hear a...*SOOTHING VOICE.*

Prepare for downboats, friend. Apparently the community worships legacy weapons and its taboo to say they shouldn't have existed
---
Well of course. With Electrically Charged, Plague Walker, and  Unstable Isotope mutations most melee things kill themselves hitting me.
---
I'll always take some free ammo
---
Can u apply a skin to that?
---
What platform you on? I've got one for sale for cheap if you want. I'm on PC.
---
They did it to me too! Killed my friendly Brahmin and gave me a thumbs up when I looked at them aghast 😡
---
same as above, friended you yesterday
---
Probably a dev testing the community to pitch his idea to management.
---
Join me please
---
good tip, thanks
---
I'll just be at my camp here on a min, it's in the vending machines, just at 0 caps
---
I don't have free ammo vendors and I lock my water purifiers. Bask in my sociopathy.
---
While I have your attention then, a more minor complaint that didn't make it into the original write up.  I'm assuming this was unintended but the "friendly" creatures aren't entirely harmless to the players.  All of the friendlies, or at least all of the ones I've had to deal with, are Glowing variants and while that looks cool and makes them stand out it also means anyone that gets too close while defending them takes a steady stream of radiation.
---
great they are fixing stuff, too bad they have to mess up a bunch of times while they do it. limited time to play here and to have to wait to download an 8 gig file before i can play sucks, twice in one week because they uploaded the wrong file......again..... what a crock of shit.
---
Everywhere? Low level scorched creatures use it so i'm always picking it up off of them.
---
Puddles work best
---
It would be nice to be able to hack the Mr. Farmers and have them tend to any gardens players set out. They could work like the extractors and keep the collected crops in their inventory until you prompt them for it.
---
I found mine on the third try at the mothman museum under the statue, I recommend hoping around a bit it can take awhile but you'll find it eventually!
---
It’s sad really, as if Bethesda is truly concerned about our family lives and don’t want us to spend too much time (more than an hour a day) in their game. All those silly caps do nothing but keep people from grinding, and as a result spending less real money in their atom store. I haven’t done any grinding or farming lately as I still have two full mules worth of legendaries can’t unload. 150 a day is three 3*** rolling pins and six one star tire irons. You can easily get those from a couple of WS runs, so that’s the amount we ‘should’ be playing.
---
I too have not found a camera.  I actually stopped looking.  I do enjoy it when a friend/team mate pulls theirs out after an event though.
---
Oh, i expect it. 
---
I'm cool with them existing. I just want them to be competitive. They are almost as broken as the tse's were.
---
Furious? Bloodied? Executioner's?
---
Oh no. Hope it's all fixed. I look forward to your threads the most.
---
Anyone who says that doesn't understand how market economies work.
---
Supply and Demand
---
If there are lots of shotgun shells on the market, and especially if you don't use them, then you will sell them at the rate you find they sell best.
---
If demand means they are all being bought up, then people will raise prices because they know they are going to sell anyway.
---
Also, cheap shotgun shells are a gift from Atom.
---
The friendly animals attack the enemies anyway don't they?
---
Happened to me seems it was because I was server hopping. I don't do that now and not happened since
---
What, you mean you don't like the challenge of taking 10 pictures of people PVPing while naked with Rose in the background doing a line of med-x while drunk for 10 Atoms? It's so easy....
---
But would you use the new effects (Just fall damage I think?) or the new Weapons (Sheepsquatch stuff and Bear Arm) over the stuff that already exists?
---
They look neat, but they need to perform as well as the stuff that already exists (Compare the Bear Arm to a Deathclaw Gauntlet or Power Fist).
---
Nice! Congrats!
---
Camera challenges should stay under world challenges as optional atom quests, not for everyone to have to do.
---
Just let me know when ya there
---
I use to have my doors open to my base but I learned quick that people lure mobs in to my base and destroyed my stuff.  It happened way more than once. So now I lock my doors.
---
I had to build a separate build for my vendor stuff. 
---
It sucks but there are a few people that love f@%king your base up, so a few ruin it for all....
---
Except for when you suddenly start spawning in at your camp under an invisible scorchbeast attack...
---
I could see them doing this with a maxed out Robot Expert Perk card, similar to how Wasteland Whisperer and Animal Friend currently work. Though hopefully they'll change the taming process to not be a random solo encounter.
---
1) This at extreme close range?  
---
2) Seen it as well, it usually clears after 90 seconds to 4 minutes.  
---
3) Seen it as well, thanks for reminding me!    
---
4) Never noticed....   
---
5) Disagree, might add later :)     
---
6) Old, will include in the NPC's page rebuild    
---
7) A guess as to when this started? I noticed  it well before 8.0  
---
8) Never went away :(    
---
9) Good Point with spawn rate, noticed it twice    
---
10) This happen right after joining a server or fast traveling there? This is an old bug introduced in Patch 7 I think.
---
11) Old Bug, introduced around Patch 4 I think, Will include in UI Rebuild  
---
12) Old Bug, will include in Quest page rebuild (Remind me)  
---
13) Be more specific please....?
---
People have definitely changed. They help you out if you ask them to (or even if you don't) and PVP is almost non-existent, unless you ask people to pvp.
---
I haven't tried this, but I thought the friendlies were immune to all friendly fire?  I did experiment with this by shooting a sacrificial lvl 1 radroach with an AA/E rifle, then tried stabbing it with an instigating bowie knife, and I couldn't hurt it.
---
It is the skin.
---
How much do you want for like 1000
---
Had the same thing happen yesteday. Alpha and last animal died at the same time so the event both failed and completed. Got the backpack for it :)
---
Watch they gonna patch this spot out like foundation stacking.
---
You can put on upper floors
---
God I hope not
---
What does the milk do?
---
Yes I must know too! It cost way too much to make them. I always by them when I can. I love the radium rifle.
---
1k;
---
Every time I've had a camera challenge that wouldn't register the only thing that fixed it was restarting the game.
---
Sent you a message and added to hopefully the right account.
---
Get ammosmith 2, farm super mutants for steel and make your own. I can make about 1,000 rounds in an hour of farming
---
If you're on PC, and see my camp, be my guest.
---
I just feel bad selling it for 1 cap per bullet.
---
I’ve got two exterminators explosive gatlings
---
The bridge on the highway  close to the spawn point of treetops ,is where i found my deathclaws.  Since patch 9 tho, i was not able to find any tamable,at all. I still have a good chunk of camp budget unused but it's really bugging me.
---
Can someone confirm they still spawn after the recent patches?
---
Would be a pretty funny Aprils Fools prank if you could lock yourself out of your camp.
---
farm the lead from that mine right near WS train station.  Just the perk card that allows you to mine double and mine all the ore. Then farm supermutants for the gunpower.  with the perk card that allows double ammo, youll have tons of ammo
---
What are the ingredients needed for Ultracite 2mm?
---
I also need lead, not just steel
---
No offense taken.  
---
I think the same thing when i read about others getting 4 digit damage from (whatever) weapon.
---
I’m a Melee build.  L88 w/15 Str.
---
  The only rifle perks i have are the 3 ignore armor perk cards + 1 tank killer.
---
110 with no bobble heads, mags, mutations, chems, etc
---
That's cool.
---
With the song title Radstorm.... I might have had to go with the band name "The Rad Boys" 
---
😋
---
Are you or a loved one currently suffering from the blight?
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
No ima need like 50-100 to get all the plans thanks tho
---
The radio DJ from Fallout New Vegas was an AI. I would love to hear one similar to him.
---
I’ll just find or make my own
---
Can get up to 50% more damage through addictions. So more damage and better accuracy than two shot. Good alternative if you dont want to do bloodied
---
If you enjoy model making, you can make a fairly lucrative side-business at it.  I sell graffiti-ed up model trains to enthusiasts for $100+ each.  I sell maybe 5-6 a year and have a couple repeat customers.  Half a grand is a lot of beer money.
---
I could see dramatically reducing both.  Especially the seats...
---
Does anyone use these?  Photomode, I guess, but otherwise more harmful than helpful.
---
If that is something you guys would consider putting in. I'd personally recommend something along the lines of a Pre-War Military alert radio station with a surly Gutsy at the helm. Allowing you to hear something along the lines of: "Attention civilians! It *seems* some military hardware has gone haywire. Please keep clear of [Location where the event is] until military technicians have handled the traitor!" for the fake Sheepsquatch event.
---
If you don´t want to download the patch and still play, start the game without the bethesda launcher. Just use the .exe in your game folder.
---
Gyms. Penitentiary in forest, Flatwoods gym and Charleston fireball gym. If the weights are gone hop server till they’re there. 200-300 lead
---
I'm at work right now if I'm lucky I'll get home a little early if I'm really unlucky I'll get home a little late so 11 
---
To 1130 latetezt, 10pm earliest.
---
I love when I get the notification I sold something, and then when I visit that person's C.A.M.P. the item is already in their Vending Machine. Happened last night with an Instigating Sickle. They were selling it for triple what they bought it from me for. Was tempted to buy it back just to confuse them.
---
I want to downvote you just for your name. 😋
---
I won't though. 😂
---
I killed Three Dog. Looking back do I regret it? Yeah, I probably do. You gotta understand though, that times were different back then. I don't think I had totally processed the loss of Heath Ledger.
---
 "this weapon and this build is the only one viable " It will always be like that.
---
You nerf one thing and the community moves to the next, one.
---
Then you nerf that and repeat.
---
Something is always going to be meta and just nerfing everything makes the life of pve players miserable.
---
I say different stats for pve and pvp.
---
That way you can balance all you want without affecting pve players.
---
I'll be drinking and playing tonight so I'll have some more pics for data for ya. Lol
---
Not sure if it matters with server lag but I'd say there has to be 10,000 seats in the game lol
---
Prime receivers add 25% damage to the gun (same as a hardened) on non-Scorched enemies and an additional 25% to Scorched, so they're a straight upgrade over the Scorched Killer receiver which does 20% less damage than normal to non-Scorched.  Pretty awesome on a 50 cal since that gun doesn't have a hardened receiver, not so much on every other gun that does have one though unless you're fighting SBQ.  The cost of the ammo increases dramatically though, for example on a 50cal it raises the price from 0.5c/bullet to 1c/bullet. Things die with less bullets though so you recoup some of that cost that way.
---
I use a Bloodied Prime 50cal and it melts everything, from Imposter Sheepsquatch to SBQ to the Project Paradise Alphas.
---
Getting on now guys! GT: AlexAutoAxe
---
Seriously...  cut 80%, few would notice
---
I still throw ammo I don't use in the blue suitcases at train stations.  Even at 1 cap a round, that's too expensive.
---
Actually don't think it should report Legendary count, breaks the 4th wall too much IMHO
---
Good info, thanks...    
---
You reminded me I've seen this as well!
---
Whitesprings Golf Club yo 
---
Sliding ghouls
---
I don't think they would care. It would be the quickest profit ever. I don't usually think of instigating being good on a sickle though. What were they selling it for?
---
If on Xbox tou can screen shoot it and delete it.
---
#ideasthatbethesdashouldhavehadatthestart
---
No News is Good News has not been updated since it went out of date 2 patches ago.
---
I have put in bug reports and have had conversation with the teams sorting it, dont make shit up.  
---
They also very regularly comment on bug reports here on reddit to let people know theyre working on them or when to expect a fix on them
---
I don’t think it’s actually in the game
---
Also drinkable water in general I could see rivers but every single puddle is a lot lol cool feature but seem like more than necessary.
---
Didn't they do that to some degree with the weapons "we increased the lethality of some weapons but reduced one shot potential of others"
---
You got my download!
---
How is that any different than somebody leading enemies to your locked doors camp and then sitting on the roof while the enemies wreck the base?
---
Lol welcome to society. Most people suck
---
From what I can tell, no.
---
Someone posted a while back that they looked into the games code and it isn't even in there.
---
The game was copy pasted from the vanilla fallout 4 and the interval switch was a workshop dlc add on. So it wasn't copy and pasted into 76.
---
Maybe a future update.
---
Damn bro what’s wrong with my name :_(
---
Had a similar issue when building my house. Try building a single stair set up to different levels of the house from the ground, then try to remove them.
---
private servers when?
---
Same, I've probably done it a hundred times, never saw anything other than the legendary radscorpion or the wendigo'd camp councellor.
---
That's why I got it too. I'd spent a while at or near max caps actively trying to find ways to use some of them at a slightly faster pace than I was gaining them. Just hit me one afternoon that I could buy that plan and be good for a while.
---
Make an offer, idk.
---
it's probably because of console limitations.
---
I sure do hope we get to carry over our characters once the PS5 comes out like how GTA5 did and upgraded online
---
Can't you go back and Pick the correct keycard? It's the one with the objectieve Diamond next to it
---
Would be really neat if you nuke one of the nuclear power plants, it causes an even larger blast zone. Could even make nuking those sites act as a hard mode modifier allowing for stronger and higher level mobs, more severe levels of radiation, and even could have an event similar to the SBQ. One of the creatures will become a hulking Goliath and slowly move from one region of the zone to the other, if not stopped it will continue to roam and cause havoc across Appalachia. This of course would also incentives moving camps closer to the edges of these zones to utilize artillery strikes.
---
If I remember correctly I took all of em, but you'll want the one with the little diamond next to it (indicates a quest item). 
---
I think. This was a few months ago it happened to me. Did it on both characters actually.
---
1500 for 1k?
---
I still managed to knock off three dailies.  That's still 30 free atoms.  I just chuckle and say "pass" on the stuff that looks way too stupid or difficult to do.
---
If you need to buy every single Atom Shop item to feel complete, get a part-time job, a checking account and toss $10 at the game once a week.  That's way cheaper than my two skateboard decks and a pair of shoes a month habit when I was working 24-32 hours a week as a paint associate at Sears in the mall in my early 20's.  (yes, they screwed 90% of their employees out of full-time to avoid benefits)
---
ALRIGHT! I've managed to get the update finally!
---
I re-tested my Gauss, specifically on a Scorchbeast. I'm going to chalk it up as either A) Fixed, B) Connection Latency on my end, or even C) Both.  
---
All I can say is that no one was around, and there weren't tons of adds that I had to contend with either (to possibly increase bandwidth), which of the \~10 shots I fired aiming with my scope (weapon is unchanged from last report) I only missed twice. Those two times I could argue were indeed misses, since they went to the side of the body and under the wing. 
---
And just to save time/spam... What [akarnokd](https://www.reddit.com/user/akarnokd/) mentioned, about the "sometimes guns fire to the side when shooting from the hip" occurred tonight for me. I don't think I've experienced that before, but it definitely was happening while at Arktos Pharam, fighting the legendary boss at the end of the event. It was in, I believe, Biome C, and there's a staircase that leads to the water which the Fog Crawler (the boss) tried to follow a player under but sorta got stuck. While I was firing my Gauss at it, my crosshairs were right on it, but the rounds were angling off to the left (causing me to miss). 
---
Also with the "enemies close up combating you in melee, causes you to miss with guns", happens to me quite often as well; however, not every shot of mine miss, as it seems only the first couple do. My typical experience is with either my Shotgun or my Lever-Action, but I would say the Shotgun experiences it possibly the worst between the two. (I've strayed away from using my combat shotty all that much anymore, so it could be that I just *think* it experiences that more... dunno.)
---
It also had seeing speed and something else on it, so it was 3 star. They were selling it for, like, 4K.
---
the wiki SHOULD do this, but theres like 5 wikis for fallout now
---
That fixed 2 of the 3. I’m not sure if that makes me feel better or worse about it lol
---
What do you mean 'bugged out' for the revive?  One thing I found is that the person you will revive has to not take TOO much damage or they don't have the option to call for help and you can't revive them.  For instance, I threw a few plasma grenades at my feet and it flat out killed me, no call for help/revive option.  I changed to frag grenades, and I didn't kill myself 'too much' so I could call for help and the person was able to revive me.
---
I’m just really stingy with my caps. I have 7000 and I feel poor, even though that’s probably plenty. I’ll consider the offer though.
---
Cause I have rocket turrents and gun turrents to stop an outside threat. 
---
Let's up ot this way my base hasn't been destroyed since I locked the doors and put up turrents.  
---
And just the simple fact that someone would even think about doing that is justification for me doing what I did.  
---
Like I said, it only takes a couple to ruin it for everyone. Dont get mad at me, get mad at the a$$holes that take advantage...
---
I think there's some issue with lighting on console, at least PS4. I can't pin down which update it started with though. 
---
Sometimes when I start the game the night will be dark, but the land will all look like it's lit by sunlight. Then at random times while I play the same thing will happen in weird spots. It usually corrects itself after a few seconds but it's pretty jarring when it happens.
---
my psn is xboxissuperior and ill be there never
---
Not really.  Honestly I'm more bummed out the gold Perk card does nothing special.
---
ooh thanks guys
---
You probably already know, but you cannot revive a player unless you have a standard stimpak in your inventory. A diluted stim will not work. I'm just letting you know in case this was your "glitch". Good luck.
---
It would be a fun novelty at first and after a few hours of hearing the same things over and over I would turn it off, just like every other radio station in Fallouts 3, 4, 76 and NV.
---
If you dont have a quad, then its one shot per reload.  This is what I was referring to with the slow fire rate.   
---
Quad obviously fixes this.
---
I attached a foundation to it and some metal stairs, then tried to delete. These suckers don’t wanna leave.
---
That's Just it. People are afraid they wont get a shot off before it dies, the bosses are less of an issue
---
lolz no worries

i've worked with both introverts and extroverts.  if we as a team are to succeed, i have to balance work and expectations  at everyone's comfort level.

Frequently when a screen is overlaid with a note, letter, lockpicking interface, etc, the game will lock up and crash to desktop.  [b0dhisattvah](https://www.reddit.com/user/b0dhisattvah) has reported it and done some looking into it; it seems to be a scaling issue.  There appears to be no fix at this point.
---
So you think is intended that somebody be able to flag you for PVP while you are in pacifist mode just by joining your group temporarily and then dropping group after they've gotten you  flagged for PVP? That's nonsense and you know it. It is abuse of a game mechanic in an unintended way.
---
oof
---
Curdle. Seriously.
---
I keep getting this. Sometimes if you add a foundation floor then scrap itll get rid of them. Or.. it wont work and now you've added to the pile.
---
Yeah, you could watch, or have someone else jump in. My friend showed me the problem, as I never spawn at the place others do. The other day I jumped to someones base and got stuck. Dude was there so I showed him where I spawned, he modified it, I jumped away and back to test. It took a couple minutes at most. Hopefully hes havimg better luck with his shop now, but I think he was solo so doing it alone would have been a hassle.
---
I have it, once you're out of danger or \[HIDDEN\] you full heal in a few seconds.
---
About the only change for me was, because diluted stimpacks become useless, i had to change over to regular stimpacks, and 95% of the time only use them for healing crippled limbs. so instead of vendoring 600+ diluted stimpacks a week, I vendor 300+ stimpacks a week.
---
What build are you running? With what weapons?
---
So....it's like a 1.5k cap weapon. They made a mistake in their valuation.
---
I tend to group up with 2-3 other friends, mainly on the weekends, and I can tell you that 80% of my three star legendary kills come from when we're a team spread all over the map.  
---
Friend at the Whitespring: "hey, I got a lvl 62 three-star on me."
---
Everyone else: "I'm porting in now."
---
Friend: "AWOL is on, guys."
---
Everyone else: "Porting in now.  Is Shank still AFK?  Let's wait to start until he comes back."
---
I just want to be able to shoot people with Nukashine. It would be glorious.
---
I have been scrapping my junkie weapons thinking they weren’t worth much. I’ll keep them for other players from now on.
---
How about a ***xx*** percent chance that players within ***xx*** distance of the kill can also loot the bodies of legendary kills?!
---
I know its not a perfect solution but I think it could help.
---
Connect a speaker to a switch by the door.
---
Yes, and i think thats the way to go. Weapon balance with pvp and pve will never work
---
4 for Lone Wanderer with Hard Bargain &amp; Travel Agent on swap.
---
Can people kill them like they can kill your Brahmin?
---
bump..
---
i say bring the party to them..
---
Buying does count if it's from a robot vendor.
---
It does not count if it's from a player vendor. This is across the board for all challenges. Example: buying a comic from a player does not check the "collect" box in the challenge. Hope this helps.
---
Cool, champ. Good luck with the toxic youth thing.
---
Also your camp takes 5 min to load in
---
There is. Mark junk for search and it will be there
---
Well I hope you feel  feel better at least you 2/3 way to being normal again.. maybe the other will start working soon... glad at least it worked part of the way for you...
---
It is exactly that. There was something much wrong in the patch for PC.
---
Blackout tactics! I like it
---
I linked this thread in the Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup Patch 9.5.  Hopefully someone will see it there if they miss it here and they can use it to help fix what's going on.
---
&gt; You're the one demanding somebody change a build, playstyle, and not use certain weapons so you can get a couple of more drops 
---
No, they didn't make any demands of anyone. Also, you're the only one coming off with an angry and aggressive tone here. I'm not angry at you, I'm just pointing out that you're wrong. The other guy probably isn't either, judging by his tone. You sure seem angry though. Maybe lay off the psychobuff and unclench yourself a little and calm the fuck down.
---
Wouldnt the cryolator damage them though?
---
I had a new kind of jerk in the camp fire tales event today, he kept running around getting the dry kindling but never put it on the camp fire. This was during the three waves portion of the event. So we lost at the very end of the third wave.
---
Or you can use the terminal in the basement and get the robots to help you and occasionally heal the experiments
---
Firstly I'll state that I'm a mostly pve mode guy with no god tier gear or weapons. 
---
The PvP mode can be very fun at times. Sometimes you run into respectful people who will leave you alone if you don't aim at them. Personally I'm one of those people and I acricelt avoid killing those under level 30 because that's just no honor killing at that point. 
---
As for killing it in pve, you'd have to remove workshops entirely or make it so that they can't be claimed and the resource generators were not able to be locked/spawned resources in the same way looting enemies does that way people couldn't camp them and make it so no one else can have any.

My favorite one is the one that goes

Funny thing is the people who i knew that spent the most money on atoms were the ones who were duping and grieving. A lot of the dupers want everything good guns, bad guns and everything in between. They collect and that included atom store items. The dupers put the most time into the game from my perspective. They dont just get 1 bloodied handmade and dupe it a million times just to dupe. They trade. They acquire new stuff. That is very time consuming. Even when they arent physically on fallout they are trying to make deals. Filthy casuals dont spend money like someone whos invested that much time into it
---
switch to a VATS build and spec for critical damage.
---
an instigating lever action with a calibrated receiver will 1-hit kill all the regular humanoid spawns.
---
Huh kinda strange, most people I run across are very polite about it. Getting chased and beat on waiting for others to get their shots in. Return the favor as much as I can. On PC though.
---
You just assume everyone that has good gear is a duping?
---
PvP gear doesn’t make you invincible. And if you don’t want to PvP, don’t. 
---
It doesn’t hold the game back, PvP is what will allow people to play for a long time. Especially PvP in this game because it’s so personal, it’s great. Bugs and glitches hold the game back because it ruins the competitiveness of many different types of weapons and gear.
---
That’s what I did. Was trying to fix the problem and only made things worse. I mean, these things aren’t even attached to anything except each other. Lol
---
All ghouls are healed by radiation damage.
---
Mr_pattybean add me I'll help. Also you can kill me 20 times for the achievement if you like.
---
I’d love a Codsworth voiced dj.
---
Dude was my favorite in 4.
---
How do you get the event to unlock? I read the alert in my terminal but I can't fast travel to the event and if I go there, there's nothing inside the elevator. Been trying every day since its launch and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.
---
My Tesla rifle still arcs to enemies even if their models haven't loaded in yet
---
I dont get it, why wouldn't you be able to break in?? Dont you have lock picks??? Or are you worried about becoming wanted??? 
---
If your worried about using picks and becoming wanted then maybe you shouldn't be doing what your doing....
---
Also you do know there a pvp mode right?? If you want to be a tough guy and destroy  peoples bases go there and leave the adventure mode people alone... not a hard concept..
---
The same thing happens if you get shot by a BE handmade. A BE laser just outranges it because if laser hitscan, they also have the ability to be full auto and beam splitter, so full auto infinite range explosive shotgun. Im talking about laser rifles, gatling plasmas are about as bad. But no, there is no way to logically change the weapons, non legacy energy weapons or non legacy explosive weapons will suffer.
---
The only way would be to either add them back to the pool, then they will be number one to obtain. Or remove entirely, which will infuriate ALOT of people.
---
Also trading and buying/selling gear is a part of the game. You do it with NPCs in previous games, and players are the NPCs in this one. So it isn't a reasonable complaint that people buy gear and are better because its pay to win... It's a sellers market, and if you refuse to trade with others to maximize your build, you are knowingly gimping yourself.
---
There was and update today?
---
Maybe try blueprinting what you want to keep then delete it all and lay back down the blueprinted part?
---
Lucky hole mine + excavator PA = a shit ton of lead. You can serverhop anywhere theres a static spawn for yoa guai to get acid for example I use mountainsideside bed and breakfast. Just go straight past Mountainside and look left down in the ravine. There's always 2.
---
Only if Insult Bot paid for ad space so he could roast us all.  I need an hourly robot burn in my life.  He's way too rare to find in game.
---
Lol gotta love it, keep trying though man it will work. And honestly it's really fun, definitely worth the trouble.
---
-chemist- can not confirm existance of pulse grenade plan in game. so can't be crafted. 
---
-collector- I'd like to know if anyone has completed this one, I've seen a post before saying one of the magazines is not in the game files. can't confirm on xbox. 
---
leather worker- technically completeable maybe, as some people have reported finding a single death law hide in a container in the wild, however death laws themselves do not drop hide. and the drop rate for the containers is extraordinarily low. I've seen only a handful of people say they found one. you need 5. 
---
musician- broken. the play an instrument at x location requirements do not complete. There are 3 of them. 
---
photographer- again possibly completable however the zones for taking an accurate pic of a vertibot and cargobot are so incredibly small. for prior photo challenges you could only complete the vertibot if it was from a direct head on view. not possible with a cargobot. 
---
 medic -I'd like to add this is completable now that the stimpack diffuser has been added to the game, however I'm a bit salty it's one of the rarest plans to drop from the new event which is already bugged and hard to complete.
---
Bro i leave little packets of ammo all over the wasteland cos i dont use it. I can see no way in which you selling some cheaply is having any effect on the economy. Some thick as shit yt fucknut said it in a video and now everyone is a fucking economical expert and unsderstands exactly the (non existant) nuances of how cheap ammo is breaking the ebb and flow of caps and that the rampant duping isnt having any imapact. You play how you want to play dude lol its a fucking game yo!!!
---
Oh man. I am thinking about it. But I’d have to scrap my whole camp, right. Took several hours because I was trying to cram in ALL of my industrial water purifiers.
---
Bla bla bla
---
Just means a high level player spawned in nearby and pushed all the levels up xD fun first time it happened to me too
---
Pretty much all things like that use IDs, not names.
---
Exit game and boot it up again
---
Yeah i was hesitant as well. Blueprint limit is kinda small for me. All i know is that the message you’re getting means the game thinks you’ll lose access to a higher floor by removing the piece you don’t want. Usually i get the message for very weird specific pieces i want to remove, it’s not a very consistent system. Best of luck dude
---
It was. I saw it on the screen while my daughter was watching netflix
---
I've run a lot of builds like this, and I start all my characters as hybrids. It doesn't look like you've got any power armor perks, so I'm going to assume this is a non-PA build. If that's so, I'd get rid of all the slugger stuff, and go for Iron Fist. Killing a big powerful enemy with a sword or a hammer often feels like you are slowly chopping wood, while it's pretty easy to do 400 plus points of damage with an unarmed weapon.
---
I'm not sure bandolier or traveling pharmacy are that useful. There's a tendency to stockpile aid, which is a holdover from those days of scarcity when you're a new character. Once you've completed the main quest, and are just running around doing events, selling excess aid just becomes part of your daily routine.  If you're not running heavy or automatic weapons, you're probably not going to be carrying enough ammo to justify bandolier. I'd consider max blocker and max barbarian instead. 
---
I don't think I'd run around with five points in gunsmith. I have a lot of intelligence perks, but only carry four points in intelligence, I swap them in and out as I need them in camp. Running around though, I mostly run nerd rage. Unless you're carrying a ton of ammo, can't see why you'd need Batteries Included. I'd think about losing some points here and putting them into Agility for Gun Fu or Dodgy.
---
White Knight is another super useful skill, but it's one you only really only need in camp (along with Fix It Good from Intelligence). 
---
I'd consider swapping Rejuvenated for Fireproof. Fireproof protects you from Scorch Beasts. I remember the first time going through Cranberry Bog, burning up the stimpacks, and yelling "how is this fun?", with Fireproof though, I just wait for them to land so I can kill them.
---
i don't think this is griefing.
---
griefers don't care about obtaining loot or completing a task. they just want to screw with you for their self gratification.
---
lazy asses, and dumb asses, still want the gold star, or toy at the bottom of the cereal box, but not the assholes.
---
assholes just want you to be miserable.
---
I do this all the time I have a base set up and the WS train station because since the vendors have came out and the fact I dont have much else to do it's became a hobby and I sell 1* trash for 50 2* for 75 and 3* for 100 and it sells quick.
---
You have my attention now.

Survivors were camping there before they were goulified

I think bethesda left out "you'll have to pay cash on ebay or a third party site to buy a duped weapon to compete."
---
Try reloading the page. Bethesdas pages often load empty.
---
Same as usual on my one x, one s and one. (Yes I have 3 consoles.)
---
Can confirm, not angry.  I offer free hugs and, if needed, generous doses of Calmex (don't worry, I have plenty of Addictol, too).
---
Excuse me but have you never seen the NPC voiced by Todd Howard himself? Look it up on YouTube, it's a fucking gem. They would need to hire anyone. Lol.
---
They can't push though. The cow-catcher on the front of the locomotive would literally destroy any cars it pushed.
---
NO SOLICITING!
---
We call those snakes or sleepers
---
Actually it's not, which is kind of frustrating.  You have to craft a brand new backpack to make it, and spend the resources to add the mod for extra space/armor/cooling etc.  I don't see why we can't just apply a skin to our existing backpack.  It's the same for the black packpack that was in the Atomic shop.
---
4....supress and tender
---
Ok. Including you that's 3 out of 2.4k people who disagree so we all doesnt mean literally every single person but the very very vast majority agree
---
If you play like this on Adventure mode you are a cowardly loser of epic proportions
---
What abo it good old BIV?
---
Damage bug, where you deal X amount of damage but then immediately Y amount is healed a fraction of a second later.  
---
Tends to happen more for builds that deal "alpha" damage like a sneak attack with a high damage weapon (100+ damage).
---
Yeah. I really hope they can fix this. I had three stairs going to my wrap-around porch (was trying to fix a misplaced stair) bc none of them would scrap 😅😅
---
You know super mutants can instantly pick level 3 locks, right?

Are you a robot?

I didn't know that.

Did the Tuesday patch work OK for you?  I got that error on Tuesday, and thought it was easiest to just uninstall and redownload the whole game so that's what I did.  Today's patch downloaded fine for me, maybe because it's 1gb smaller so my 13gb free space was enough.
---
I've seen posts where others have had this problem, and we all seem to have only about 10-13 gb free space.  Maybe the launcher needs more space than the download size for replacing files, so it looks for something like 14gb, but if it can't find that much it thinks you need to install the whole game.
---
If you can, maybe try freeing up 5gb and see if it works.
---
All means all plain and simple 😂
---
Not if the dialogue is to current events and new content, ever changing.
---
Amen to that brother!
---
Poor fella doesnt know what a turn of phrase or a hyperbole is. Get real.
---
I've brought some serums to use myself. But since serums take as much space in inventory or stash, I have them on stash, and I've also listed the ones I really don't want to sell, for 750c. No one should buy serums for that but if someone does, that's their thing.
---
I was thinking the same thing last night. Mostly as I'm trying to respec my main a bit :p
---
Get a good pvp armor set and wear it with pa then you can jump out when you need to and have better protection. But if you are not specced for pvp, if you have ease of life like thru hiker etc on instead of damage buffing cards, then youre fucked. Watch ragechronicles on yt, he takes over workshops with that method and you can learn a lot from watching it happen. Always put up a sly few rocket turrets and heavy turrets, as the bullets explode, when you have a workshop. Dont just run back in there if you get one shot as they will just be waiting for you.
---
Yup, not there.
---
And that's what matters when you need caps and when others need wares.
---
I would have gone with "nukashine while the nukes shine" as the song title. That's a great picture, my favorite paint
---
What platform?
---
Okay. I misspoke. What I meant is you can't craft it without being able to craft the standard backpack. Thanks for the correction.
---
Logic gates as well! So much potential with them.
---
Hell yea we do! Let’s do it Bethesda!!
---
I think this has been an issue for a while but:
---
Fragmentation Grenade MIRVs no longer spread their bomblets over a large area like they once did, instead the initial detonation seems to prematurely explode the spawned bomblets in the initial blast area, defeating their purpose.
---
I would like a timed switch, that way noone would forget to close my dang door!
---
Look around the area a bit more, and you’ll find out what’s really going on.
---
What's your GT?
---
Zartu
---
Go up the hill from where you are and look for a treehouse. All will be revealed.
---
Add scrapper to this, boost that steel quite a bit
---
Only reason I grab miniguns now, 21 steel a pop
---
I would love to see the workshop have a 30min to 1 hr grace period free from pvp. Also a two hour max ownership period with say a 1 hr cooldown to take it again.
---
People can then at least use the workshop for limited time before it become available for pvp takeover.
---
Not a bad idea.  I've been trying to get my friends to play Free Range and this might help.
---
N/m, I sleuthed a little and got it...
---
It's just Zartu
---
I'm going to be upset if we don't get the other half of the Easter Bunny outfit next year!
---
To a certain extent yes but I wouldn't put it past bethesda to remove some of this stuff like they have in the past with the power armour.
---
Yeah should’ve added scrapper myself, some of the assault rifle variants give 25-30 with it
---
Btw, thanks!
---
Ahh [PC] users.
---
Actually I'm being very real. Don't get upset because I disagree and stated it. Don't post stuff if you can't handle someone not feeling the same way and say hey no not everyone agrees. I find the robots and music annoying that's just me personally. I am not part of all don't try and smart your way out of iit is what it is
---
If it highlighted ores like the targeting hud does enemies that would be just cool, i would definately use it
---
^ This, even if the event isn’t active it’s a nice place for loot and the environment itself is just awesome. Haven’t had any bugs yet
---
Yeah on several occasions I’ve had all of my 90 items from three vendors just booted back to my stash or inventory and my shop taken off the map. I too set all my prices manually so it’s a huge hassle and is a little disheartening. I wish we could just type in the price instead using the slider also.
---
Had this happen twice to me in the last couple of days: in the Burrows and in Harpers Ferry.
---
Listen kiddo. I'm not mad that you disagree. I just think you acting like you dont know what I meant is silly and a waste of both of our time. Only an idiot would think I'm saying every person alive agrees with me. You're in the wrong post if you are looking for an immature arguement. Move along. You are the one arguing semantics to "smart your way out" of looking ridiculous.
---
In certain places I want to put roof arches, the game tells me item is floating or intersecting when there's clearly nothing there. http://prntscr.com/nszgpk

I hate BIV. Please anyone else. I volunteer. I'll do announcements like a high school principal on pizza day.

Guess what folks? It's NOT Grafton Day. However if you're in the celebrating spirit, head over to the Pumpkin House and tell them I sent you.
---
I probably should have thrown this in your weapons post

I am not a smart man

It’s a survival game. It’s showing you where other survivors did things.

That translates to: "Yes I am".

^(I am a bot. I'm sorry if I ruined your surprise.)
---
Sorry didn't work for me, I posted a pic on BethNet forums.  Still getting the same yellowy glowy patchiness when playing for awhile and doing a lot of FTing.  Not sure if the patch was to fix that or something else.
---
And where they made crucial mistakes lol
---
Yes fucking please that would speed my new build drastically.
---
I think it would have to be live talk radio. Songs would be too hard to get the rights to broadcast online.
---
Hell yes!
---
Not sure how you could think there is anything about this hardcore game, which I am blatantly saying is too easy and broken, the opposite of hardcore.  
---
Cool troll attempt tho.
---
The remote changes the channel
---
Fomo. They have prob been burnt many times in past like you, so dont want to take chances it will happen again.
---
Not saying its right, but i do understand it. Just not my style though.
---
This sucks :( I’ve got 3 Brahmin at my camp, I was going to put a vending machine down because I’m a hoarder and figured someone else could probably use my stuff. I also wanted to show off my camp a little. But I’m worried I’ll come back and find my Brahmin dead so didn’t bother. Thankfully I’m in an area with little foot traffic so haven’t experienced this yet.
---
60 for armour.  100 for weapons.
---
Hahaha for sure. I love seeing little scenes like that and putting together a story. There’s a lot more depth to this game when you really look at little stuff like that. Sometimes it’s real sad but still interesting.
---
Thanks! can’t wait to heal some ghouls!
---
It's always been 100 scrip for weapons. I think armor is cheaper though.
---
Ah ok
---
Kill it.
---
Yeah someone else just commented that haha thanks though.
---
[**annoyed beeping**]
---
Not here to make friends, couldn't care less if you decide to use any information I present for any purpose what so ever.  I tell it like it is and move on.  
---
You answer your own question.  You have tested, and are still not effective.  You have seen effective players, which means the problem is your testing.  You don't have to ask me, ask anyone you see being more effective than you are.  One of them is bound to hold your hand and spell it out for you.
---
Nope. it's always been 100 for 3\* legendary melee/ranged weapon. Maybe you're thinking of 3 star armor?
---
My camp gets attacked every time I go there what now you fucking genius
---
\*cough\* Brotherhood of Steel are in the game \*cough\*
---
I agree with this completely with this
---
I visited a CAMP recently that had a pet Deathclaw.  Thing scared the Calibrator off my 10mm SMG as I rounded a corner and a flipping Deathclaw was just chillin there.  I didnt kill it though, even snapped some pics with it.
---
I think I got it switched up in my head haha but you're right. Thanks
---
The moment they ship (low priority mail), a deluxe version will show up in the atom shop for 200 atoms and will ship next day air.
---
I'm not a kid at all and your being judge mental by assuming and infact I told your words as what they actually mean and by actual definition. You out me on blast for opion and simple stating not everyone. Don't post if you don't want responses and learn to not judge as much.
---
Like that skeleton holding a toastee in the bath tub... geeeez
---
I can't think of any RPG where characters are unique with player bases this large.  Certainly no MMORPG's come to mind.  Maybe Path of Exile has enough options to make you unique in a minuscule, meaningless way - but it's barely an RPG.
---
The desire to be unique is something that just isn't possible in popular multiplayer games these days.  One of the chief reasons is also a problem we see here in 76.  Letting players play whatever they want yields to players encountering more difficulty than they can handle, and end up frustrated and quit.  Being unique comes at the price of being effective in black and white, either its equipped or it isn't, character "building" like 76's perk system.
---
Fuck that those things are creepy af.
---
Should the ghouls not squat and pinch one off either?
---
This happened to me the other day.  Just collected most of my junk to reorganize stuff and someone blasted me in my workshop.  I was pissed!!!!
---
If its personal you dont need the rights
---
Haven't had much trouble in Violent Night or Uranium Fever. Most players will tag the legendaries and then leave them alone. Campfire Tales tends to be a mess so I'm not surprised if people accidentally kill the legendary.
---
At launch me and my friend had hypothesised him going full into like a battering melee tank build while i would play the medic who would keep him up with healing syringes. very disappointed this was never thought about in development considering the emphasis on teamwork. would love for this to be implemented. it could even be balanced to require a stimpack for each healing syringe, it could have the bonus to deal equivalent damage to an enemys HP as healing to a teammate’s Hp
---
This comment needs more upvotes! 😂
---
Very true, lots of stuff are simply picked up not even crafted. 
---
After an ISS event someone asked whether anyone has spare 308 ammo coz he used up all his. I dropped all I had back then, about 5000 rounds, in a paper bag for him. Bunch of players jumped on it right away I had no idea whether the poor guy got any lol. I primed my LMG so the normal 308 rounds were just sitting on me, glad someone else could take them.
---
I actually like listening to the radio much more because there’s no host.
---
Care about others?  This is a video game, not a human rights movement.  The way I enjoy games is to roleplay the most powerful character I can make - it's how the overwhelming majority of people play video games, that's why nearly all of them counter to the power fantasy as their chief attraction.  Make numbers bigger.
---
It's not anyone's problem but Bethesda's that the mechanics in 76 are what they are.  Begging people to gimp themselves will never work, feel free to keep doing it - but until you stop talking to anyone but the people who can fix this problem, you're just wasting your time.
---
This is old &amp; I haven't played in weeks but you could try to call in a supply drop &amp; hopefully be close enough when it does the actual drop off. 
---
So unless you need the cargo bot specifically the virtibot on the landing pad is the best option.

it removes a small amount of rads without side effects, which if you play bloodied is extremely handy for keeping your rads right where you want them.

Honestly I wouldn't use it but I must say it is a great mod idea that would perfectly suit the excavator.
---
If anything that would have the opposite effect I think.
---
Bummer dude.
---
Are you computer
---
I kinda like leaving a sheepsquatch in chunks after taking minimal damage while killing it.  Killing even a full mosh pit of glowing ghouls during a Whitespring nuke isn't very exciting.

The bosses for Encryptid and Project Paradise are my favorite, because there's a bit of strategy and risk involved.  You see the tell on the strike and need to either block or find cover before it hits.  It makes a 3-star AA/SS/block fire axe pretty nice when you can actually take a hit from the Project Paradise Grafton Monster in a T-51b suit with three ranks of Blocker perk equipped.  That is, if you have good timing and see the hit coming.  Otherwise it's respawn time.  I'm still using a lot of stimpaks, but at least the friendly critters are safe from one-hit death.  
---
A tesla coiled power armor torso draws aggro like nothing else in the game.  A must have if you're trying to tank.  (serendipity, field medic, first aid and nerd rage perks also help a LOT when you have to eat a Mike Tyson punch and potentially have a dozen other critters trying to smash you.)
---
Why do you need a light mg
---
Childish Gambino knock off, lol.
---
I'm just messing with ya.
---
Nice!!
---
i had some asshole griefer do that to me as well. he got me twice. what sucked was we were fairly even bu5 i had pacifists enabled and forgot NOT to attack.
---
i quit doing munitions and got ammosmith +2.
---
does 1.8 :1 bullets each time.
---
no fuss, no muss, no assholes.
---
Check my guide about CAMP glitches. I have a section on foundations and ramps so you may be able to find the cause or solution there.

---
I'll have to try that out. 
---
Crazy thing though. I just checked the disk space usage for FO76 on that computer and its saying something like 90 gigs is being used. Something very wrong here I think. I might have to reinstall completely like you did.
---
Oh ty yes I got it I just wasn’t close enough , it’s dumb that you mod your camera with a zoom lens but you have to be right up on the object to get cred for pic lol
---
Turn up your volume
---
I just sell them.  I can’t think of any situations where I need something like +1 Agility for one hour.
---
they last an hour, two with perk. think of them like food buffs, or if you're a collector, wait for the eventual bobblehead shelf.
---
There used to be the metal railing in fallout 4. It wasn't the greatest but it did look better than the wooden fencing.
---
Thanks for this. This might be an excellent reference tool. Appreciate it.
---
Interesting. Any idea if a unique Assaultron blade will count? I've been using 'The Gutter' as my main melee recently.
---
I use them to buff myself before an event.
---
They really didn’t do much for anyone interested in being a “healer”
---
I think that's fair. I do like the ability to listen to music one song after another. I think part of it too is that I like the way Bethesda does their atmospheric music. Like bird chirping, building metal moaning and aching from wind movement. Fallout 76 really hits home for me, because it's not too far from Tennessee. The sound design makes me feel right at home.
---
Because muling is sooooo hard.
---
Nice. I'm far enough into collecting now, that I'm down BE, AAE etc type of Gatling Guns.
---
This is why I love games like this.
---
The community can be awesome.
---
Always got an asshole or two somewhere but the majority is pretty friendly and helpful.
---
That's kinda what I thought. And I'm kinda a collector
---
No, because that is scamming, Scamming is not against the rules and is allowed in the game. It is an associated risk of joining a party. If a party member is flagged for PVP, all members on said party are flagged for PVP. This is known before you join a party.
---
Hence why I again say you have no idea what the term griefing means.
---
They’re planning on adding in the ability to decorate your home with things from your stash.
---
I’ve collected the SPECIAL Bobbleheads to spell it out on my shelf when they eventually stop delaying it
---
lolz 
---
after grinding for copper in mire went south to bog, ran into a legendary mirelurk queen, and got too close to a fissure and triggered a SB. 
---
took awhile but got them finally fighting each other, instead of me.
---
thought for a sec, i was screwd..
---
As long as I can task him to repair my camp items to 100% if he uses mats from my stash.
---
Sadface
---
Then auditions ar whenever Bethesda says.
---
Im not sure if this is the issue but do u have enough power going to them?
---
You came here seeking confrontation. I'm done wasting time with you. Have a nice day.
---
We need the adventures of Herbert Daring Dashwood and Argyll to come back haha
---
You are correct. Tier 4 weapon mods currently include elemental damage over time effects.
---
It's a nocturnal tesla rifle. Good or not, it'll be unique by next Tuesday to whoever got it so might be worth picking up
---
Leader is the only one I hoard
---
The SB will turn the mirelurk into a scorched when that happens making the problem way worse lol.
---
Amen.
---
I am sorry if this upsets anyone if I missed this but I did not see a bug list for urban scout armor left arm(?) being far below armor rating then the rest of the set, even the forest version is correct. Also, Shadow mod does not change the texture of scout armor, not a huge deal though compared to other bugs in the game. 
---
I got to say this, that you guys putting this all together is amazing.
---
The worst is FT to someone’s camp to shop and getting stuck cause their camp spawned around you.
---
That guy clearly had his parents bribe his kindergarten teacher to give him a pass after failing all sharing curriculum.
---
I’m behind you in this. Vanguard/Sentinel/Bloodied builds are ruining competition. I’ve busted my ass to be level 100 and have JUST completed my build, which I think a lot of- and I don’t stand a fucking chance in survival.
---
Leaves one feeling very weird and frustrated, because the only way to compete this late in the scene is drop $200 on eBay deals. I’m proud of my build. And it is *NOTHING*
---
They dont weigh much but I dont think they help all that much. So who would buy them from my lil' shoppe?
---
Big Guns and Explosive Bobbleheads, plus an Explosive .50 Cal.....hello Queen.
---
PvP is a broken one hit samurai showdown mess.  The sucker punch is a favored tactic.
---
Either this or increase our stash size.
---
This one makes zero sense to me.
---
I miss Mr. New Vegas
---
Yeah, I put some items for free in my machine because I either have way too many of them, or I’m trying to entice people to spend money on the more costly items
---
It could be server based, I've started saving up my scrip instead of doing 3  2\* weapon rolls per character per day. When you get 3 very good rolls in a row that (supposed) randomness doesn't seem so random. Mostly I expect trash, but if I get it twice I don't have enough scrip left over to hop.
---
Thanks for the quick reply. A bit weird that this isn't posted on the launcher itself but oh well 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I'd like it if they had a strong southern accent like the Scout handy's do, adds some Appalachian charm to it.
---
I consume them for the challenges, otherwise, I sell them
---
If they are unlocked and you are a vendor. People are helping themselves....guaranteed.
---
thanks. Had this installed before patch 5 but couldn't remember which one added that feature.
---
I’m also on PS4. I’ve timed my industrial water purifiers, and they are only producing one about every 2.5 minutes.  And it’s inconsistent; I’ve cleared the two I have at the same time, and they seem to replenish at different rates like you’re seeing.  It’s odd...
---
How about Raider Radio? Some crazy Raider DJ that insults everyone and plays outlaw country songs, maybe? And they could still do updates like you suggested. 👍
---
Literally falls right under the first example listed in the definition.
---
&gt; Intentional friendly fire or deliberately performing actions detrimental to other team members' game performance, including wasting or destroying key game elements, colluding with the opposition and giving false information.
---
Joining a team, shooting your buddy to flag PVP, then dropping team to shoot your former teammate pretty clearly fits this definition.
---
And even if it didn't, your pedantry is petty and useless. Keep stewing in that petty rage if you like.
---
I'd personally would like a protectron voice because they sound funny, but it would sound really slow for a radio DJ.
---
I've got a couple to add
---
\~Dying at the same moment as the Imposter Sheepsquatch, during the "Encryptid Event" will cause your camera to spin around your character with the option to respawn, however pressing the button to respawn doesn't respawn you. I've been forced to Alt+F4 the game because of this bug. I do however get event rewards.
---
\~Sometimes in trade menus (can be any, vendor bot, Legendary scrapper, other players vendors) it will back me out of it, without pressing the button to do so.
---
\~Server hopping yesterday, I found weight reduction armour perks  weren't working properly. Taking off and reequipping didn't work, a server hop fixed it though. Also, despite being encumbered wt wise, it didn't show the over-encumbered red icon in the HuD and I was able to fast travel but not sprint.
---
\~Responderbot random encounter vendor just dies for no reason after a few minutes.
---
\~Still issues of "this item is floating/needs support/nothing is selected/part of this structure would become inaccessible'' messages when building in CAMPs. I noticed the last one yesterday with 4 foundations and nothing else, I had to pay 40c to move my camp ever so slightly to fix it.
---
\~My vending machines resetting after random disconnects from server.
---
At least the option to shut it off, please.
---
I have to admit that I’m not sure.  I’ve only made lvl 15 ones, and wasn’t watching if the higher level ones I found had better odds at providing mod plans...
---
That would be great I didn't think of that
---
So you spawn in at a separate place too?
---
Should really be a PSA about that.  Most probably think there's no problem because their spawn point is fine.
---
This is a good point to save script and hope for a hot server/streak. A very good point.
---
Yep.  I remember using those at the very beginning, but not later.
---
Pretty sure if you come back in 1 hour they will all have 5.
---
1000 thumbs up!!
---
I have a radshower in a little interior garden at the first floor of my [Whitespring Station hotel](https://imgur.com/hdi2WG1), at the bottom of the stairs leading down.  There's a toggle switch to turn it on and off before walking through it and grabbing some corn to eat, should you prefer to keep your rads.  I appreciate your life choices.
---
Was this my camp?
---
What fixed it for me is I completely unplugged my Xbox for a solid minute or so. This fixed the issue for me.
---
the obvious choice is to use a weapon outside of your build.  But I run bloody melee and I will carry a tag weapon but I'm not waiting for a minute whike something if smacking me because people can't pay attention.   I call it out but if someone's in party chat or just dicking around I am going to smack it and move on.  Purposely doing it is a dick move but after 30 seconds its your loss.
---
So, if 76 is a prequel to the future....? When do the bobbleheads become permanent? 
---
Just asking
---
Mostly this but legendaries are way too expensive. I have 1 stars listed for 100-500 caps. Garbage cheap for scrip hunters and bloodied/2 shot usable stuff not much more. I regularly see 1 stars for 1500+. I'm not paying 1000 caps for a mutant slayers 10mm, I don't know how they're getting sales. Vendor price is almost nothing so I don't know where they get some of these prices from
---
Yeah I was finally able to try it myself and it didn’t work for me either. Shame
---
Bethesda can't do that though.
---
For every player on the map to receive an item, it would have to be an event completion reward. If it is an event completion reward, it would have to be a set item and not be able to be a random item. Everybody would get the same legendary every time.
---
For the boss to be an open party lootable with a non-shared loot table to avoid a WoW Need before Greed loot system, events would have to be instanced. Events can't be instanced because we're allowed to server hop. We can't have set servers because the player count per server is too low. We can't increase the player server count because the game content is built around having low population servers and netcode held together by paperclips.
---
As you see, the whole thing unravels. To get what people want here, the game would need a substantial overhaul.
---
No problem, now I just have to save it up for a few days ;)
---
And ate all the crayons
---
Better yet. I want a welcome mat that acts asxa fast travel spot in my camp.
---
I'm sure those were some interesting poos for his parents to see, because he was probably still wearing diapers at age 6.
---
How do you export the photos? Just screencapture from the photomode gallery?
---
IGN: 2/10 -too much water
---
Wtf?!
---
Maybe you need a better internet connection.
---
Add in that power armor still gets deleted from your inventory at random, unlearned recipies dissapeared from your inventory ( happened to my buddy with the refrigerator mod for backpack), weapons randomly getting deleted from inventory for no reason. Friends list is still broken since beta, carry weights dont transfer properly between getting in and out of power armor. Game crashes at random (arktos pharma quest mostly right now). I could go on but that is all I can think of right now off the top of my head.
---
Yeah. The lights are lit on all of them.
---
They are all locked.
---
-_-
---
Asked every damned day. Just play it and form your own opinion
---
So next time u tame a deathclaw pacify it then log out it will keep the white bar and will not attack players and they will not be able to kill it assuming you are in passive mode
---
I've never seen one get above three regardless of the time away.
---
Honestly, i think taking the picture of a naked player in a nuke zone was one of the easiest ones. I would stay in nuke zones naked for people just to help them complete the challenge. If you have radshields+glowingblood+rad resist perks youll only take around 12 rads a second. Not bad if you have the chems/perks and radaway for it.
---
Weird that my internet connection prefers melee weapons and the latest patch suddenly made my internet connection worse.
---
100mbs internet not enough?
---
dude,  will take me 3 days to download the game
---
It's also worth saying it LOOKS like you get one shot because you got killed so fast. It's not one shot.
---
Actually not a terrible idea. I'm surprised.
---
We need MORE camera challenges! I will not rest until fallout 76 has become the Fallout equivalent of Pokémon snap!
---
Interesting. I don't think I've seen anyone break the leaks down yet but it's possible I just missed a post. What I remember specifically were a certain AI remarking about testing and data points, referencing clearing vault rooms,  certain named characters such as Sgt. Bob and others, Vault 51 overseer selections, squad or team gameplay including notifications about imminent squad wipe for you or your enemies, launching nukes as a "final" solution via a briefcase, a massive radiation storm with a peaceful "eye" in the center and I recall some sort of ranking system for completing the tests for the Vault 51 overseer selection process. Did I miss anything? What do you think these things all mean?
---
what is this !
---
They're just idiots and shouldnt have built their workbenches next to open windows.

"\[PC\] Fallout 76 Update – May 24, 2019
---
Hi everyone,
---
We’re planning to release an update for the **PC version** of  Fallout 76 today, May 24, to address an issue affecting an exterior  lighting file. This will not require downtime, but PC players will need  to download the update.   
---
We used an incorrect lighting file when we released Patch 9.5 for PC  earlier this week, and today’s update will address this by applying the  file we had originally intended to implement. Unfortunately, this is not  a small file, and PC players who have already installed Patch 9.5 will  receive a download size of approximately 8.5 GB today.   
---
However, as a result of this update, PC players who had **not** yet applied Patch 9.5 will have a much smaller download size once they do update to the latest version of the game.   
---
Console versions of Fallout 76 are unaffected by this issue and  console players who have installed Patch 9.5 will not need to download  anything. Additionally, we are not making any gameplay changes, which  means there will be no patch notes for this update.   
---
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience  this may cause for those of you who had already downloaded Patch 9.5 on  PC. "
---
Your character reminds me of Red Green
---
 [http://www.redgreen.com/watch.html](http://www.redgreen.com/watch.html)
---
Sounds similar. Doesn't even take a minute to clear all of them but there's no telling of they'll have anything at all when I check again.
---
Lol well you can just repair brahmin they dont dissapear
---
I've been looking for him in the forest region. Still cant find him.
---
XBox is gamertag
---
While i'm not sure if what your saying about them is 100% true, but this game's player base is mainly pve and pvp server are mostly empty.
---
I wish they would stop trying to make it work and just give us more hard pve content. I feel its thanks to the loud wieners of the small pvp player base that we are getting a dump battle royal mode instead of some really good story content.
---
He's my only ride or die in the game we've been through wars together so he gets a pass
---
The best I’ve found to do this event is just fully power one feeder so that the resulting animal that spawns is a high level usually it’s a death law or yoi guai for me they usually don’t even need to be defended because they’re so tanky. Just my experience though
---
Most people have no idea fair market value so they can either play two fields. 1) they low ball, then slowly build up or 2) they high ball and slowly drop. So it's possible won't get any sales with their 1* legendaries for 1500+, but eventually they'll realize their costs are too high to sell, then reduce. Or not. 😂🤷
---
**Hard Hats Fail to Retain Color After Picking Up**   
---
*(can't comment on Steel Worker, but will see if I can find some and edit post after)*  
---
Rather easy to reproduce. Hit up the buildings just outside of Blackwater mine to find one, pick it up while noting the color. Equip, view third person, note that it's *not* the same color (can also just inspect from Pip after picking it up). Hard Hats seem to default back to a Green, regardless of what color they were when you picked them up. 
---
This does ***not*** appear to impact the Mining Helmets (hardhat+light), at least not when equipped (worn). If you have multiple in your inventory and have fast-traveled, they may show all the same color in some menus, but when worn/inspected they reflect their real color.
---
Then your Internet is too shitty to even play it. Damn.
---
No time limits , what we need is a limit to how many you can control that way one guy doesn't have 5 of them or being the butt that has all 3 power plants.
---
Not anymore i guess. I went to a camp that had a deathclaw and tested a couple of shot on it. First shot took the health down but it got back up; second shot did no damage.
---
You continually ignore that the specific game mechanic is built with what people are doing in mind. "Unintended ways" is the key word here, There is no pedantry occurring. While Adventure may be PVP-lite with a toggable passive mode, using said mode does not absolve you from other players scamming, nor does it absolve you from any other PVP related content that is allowed in Adventure mode.
---
There is no stewing. I will continue pointing out that you're using the term incorrectly and improperly labeling other players as griefers because that is what you are doing. The only people generating toxicity are people like you who label others as griefers when you are mildly inconvenienced
---
500 atoms
---
Try walking there from a different location. That's the only way I can get in to project paradise may work for this too.
---
The one i picked progressed the quest (i believe to had the diamond mark), but won’t let me open the door. I could be wrong about the mark though.
---
That’s really conservative lol. But seriously I’d pay that easy. I got a real nice house with hard wood and brick and then garbage railing
---
Very few people pvp the new servers are ghost towns. Pve is where its at.
---
he just wants to be like a molerat man leave him alone lol
---
I thought i picked the one with the diamond, but this occurred months ago and I’m just coming back to the game
---
It's my face as I'm tired of seeing these posts
---
Might not be players, could be the mobs that spawn when someone travels there. I know I've had to repair stuff alot more frequently and they always seem to target my brahmin first.
---
Running around nuked WS. Chasing the Queen because people still dont know how to group up. Chasing the cargobot across the fkn map for a nuke card.
---
If you go to the special page on your pip boy it tells you what each attribute effects.
---
I feel like adding armor to the Atom Shop is treading close to P2W.  I would love to see some new Armor Variants, and feel the game will need to change that look to stay relevant, but going through the Atom Shop is probably not the best way to do it.
---
Need to shorten the nose and bring the cheekbones and jaw in a bit.
---
You did go through all the prep confirmation of purchase and address verification? What did I you think of the collector edition I really haven’t had a chance to look at it. I just took out the game and started playing, but never really opened it up to take a look. The collectors for 4 was awesome I wore that pipboy every time I played the game. I don’t think I would be able to do the same with the helmet, but maybe I will try sometime. I was really hoping that they would make an app so I could use it with 76. That would be the shiiiiit!
---
How about pvp just dying off so us pve player can get more content your already getting a battle royal.
---
And change the mouth shape to the thin lips.
---
Tl;dr **Fun House.**
---
Steel, lead and gunpowder. Make them. Use Super duper and ammosmith perks.
---
Walking there from gaully mine worked for me.
---
You’re going to need hundreds. It has a much lower learn chance than other weapons. I figure I’ve scrapped close to a thousand and still haven’t learned them all.
---
I think that’s most of what I’ve seen (though I hadn’t heard of the briefcase or storm yet), but I’m currently inclined to think all of it fits my proposed model: Vault 51 will feature a mode more like Hunter/hunted in that it’s a mini-game present on the server, but doesn’t affect the server’s rules. Meanwhile, the storm and briefcase seem like they will fit in the new server mode, titled “Nuclear Winter” that has something to do with nukes and weather.
---
Just wait for a Skateboard dlc then
---
I don't think it was a player. I went to a camp with a deathclaw and it was invincible to my shots.
---
I have three for yah on PS4:
---
1. Scorch beast heeling. If you are against a Scorch beast when it lands it will sit there and not attack unless you move away. I took out three in a row doing that.
---
2. Hag Raven Power armor. Sometimes when watching a teammate climb into power armor or when entering an interior zone, the power armor disappears and the naked player character is stretched to the skeleton of the power armor, making it look like a hag raven from skyrim.
---
3. BOS quest: heart of the enemy. If you load the sample into the centrifuge before resolving the power issue, you can't reroute power at the power terminal
---
😂😂😂
---
i find broken ones all over the place i right now have 6 of them and a spare non broken. i would give people them but they are like the backpacks and cant be dropped.
---
Why do you need to ask
---
Just to be totally honest and up front. I sent a request off the original confirmation email on the same day as I posted this. Just received a contact from Bethesda saying there will be an email once the bag has been shipped. So,still hasn't been sent, but soon(ish)
---
or maybe an actual human npc. this is one part salt one part the genuine love of the idea of some crazy old koot who managed to survive the apocalypse \*twice\* running a radio tower
---
I've been using your app for awhile and I really like the new update! Well done!
---
&gt; There is no pedantry occurring.
---
&gt; I will continue pointing out that you're using the term incorrectly
---
LOL OK then, you keep telling yourself that. I looked at your post history, and it is pretty clear you're a griefer and that is why you're mad. If you're not 100% just putting on a little show here with a fake persona, you're one of the saddest people I've encountered in awhile. Done with ya now, just gonna go ahead and tag you as a petty griefer and never speak to you again. I suggest visiting a psychotherapist.
---
Rose and ads from grahm talking about deals and when it says words from are sponsers you here grafton mayor talking about his campaign and you would also here recruitment ads for the brotherhood and the responders now that would be bad ass excuse my language
---
Positive they're industrial and not large?
---
Oh shit, are they a thing? Lol.  
---
I just assumed it's a bug, because I've seen scorched trapped in a barrel walking around before.
---
I honestly didn't even notice a legendary at campfire due to the chaos of everyone running and gunning and I've done it 6 times. Apparently never hit the thing either cause I've never came out with a legendary item either. 😥
---
none in player vendors?
---
"Th-" "Uhh huh" "Bu-" "Uhhh huh" "If yo-" "yeah "Will yo" "Yup"
---
Double damage...
---
What be cool is they do a weekly update on who the best seller of the day week month...give people another thing to belive in.
---
As unbalanced as matchmaking is in survival it is doomed. Actually there is no matchmaking. Either be lvl 200 baddass or lose your caps.
---
Still angry that i kept searching for the fertilizer station and it was under brahmin pen
---
What prevents someone from stashing items there at exorbitantly high prices? Then it's just another stash box.
---
Explosive weapons can beat your opponent in 0.2 seconds. This is not a game. You can not explain.
---
what happens if your camp cant be placed on a world.. or the owner just removes a full machine?
---
where does all that loot go?
---
To be honest I can’t stand Bob’s voice. Maybe Vendor Bot Wallace’s *soothing voice* would work better?
---
for high traffic, whitesprings is always the only answer. you can put it as close to the fast travel point as possible for a lot of trades (across train station), or on the other side there are 2 places in the mountain with lead deposits.
---
I could see that happening but given that the quest giver AI character seems to be the same for each of these references do you think it's more possible that it's all under the same new game mode? Is there anything in specific that hints to them being separate?
---
True. But this is exactly why theres a scrip limit.
---
I already have a couple gaming rooms on matrix linked to discords, it should only take a couple hours
---
The terminal hacking could be useful during silo runs. Others are good if they fit your build or you have a plan to use them. I sold several for caps to free up stash space.
---
If PC I have
---
Furious, Mutant Slayers, Quad, and Troubleshooters. All lvl 45, all 1\*.
---
What kind of price are you looking to spend?
---
FYI Corpses count, so taking photos of dead mobs will count towards challenge progress.
---
Though I don’t see anything that specifically talks about an inability to remove a foundation/ramp that is not attached to anything (except, in my case, another ramp). Still giving message about inaccessibility.
---
Do you play the Whitesprings sprint? I once made it all the way to the opposite end of the mall before I spawned in.
---
I agree, shit needs fixing, solution seems simple.
---
Positive. Maybe it's related to the number I have running. Guess I'll reduce the number and see what happens.
---
I won't be on for about 4 hours but I'm game if you still are.
---
I also have a Deathclaw pet, Most people who visit my vending machines follow it around while shooting, stabbing and punching it. They do no damage. NPC’s however do damage it.
---
I'll join ya
---
What a terrible shortsighted and uninformed suggestion for fixing a valid problem. First off I agree with the premise. While I think survival to be the best thing there is, the Fallout franchise, while providing the most interesting PvP setting, comes from PvE roots and has a large playerbase for which PvP is something completely unwanted.
---
These people should be allowed to play the game as they expect to play it, chillout couch afternoon coop relax. This is a fine and valid need that should be catered to.
---
Then, there are people who can't stand current meta in a nonunreasonable way - they prefer they'd be given only one character separate from rest of characters, preferably no legendary items whatsoever (IMO only named legendaries for quests should be considered there, no RNG, so that legendaries would be legendary). They also want more harsh dying and fool loot drop would become applicable on a mode with no legendaries. They should be given hardcore survival mode.
---
Current survival is in sweet spot between the two and should remain where it is. I can have my fun hunting the hunters, and then I can join my friends and help them take first steps in game. Its great for PvP organised groups, and doesn't require OP duped gear to be successful - I myself PvP a lot and use zero assassin/sentinel pieces and my main gun is not an explosive one. I have shitloads of OP gear, some of it duped at some point judging by other people trading offers, but I use unique unwanted stuff and still occupy leaderboards. I also only hunt the hunters, and I often see how low levels are allowed to pass around in the middle of active PvP warzones - noone of the sharks are interested in such prey. Survival between consenting well specced well equipped teams is rather friendly activity that often ends up in late night discussions. Its completely unlike these griefer scum harrasing PvErs at workshop for caps make it seem for PvErs.

This. If you want foot traffic, this spot is it. I gets sales before my camp even loads in completely. It literally just happened, sold BoS combat armor legs, arms, and chest for a total of 1900c before the camp loaded all the way
---
I’ll probably be on for a while if a group doesn’t get together!
---
...Thats just how product development works.
---
Sweet. Luckily you can already enjoy adventure mode. For the many people who disagreed with the anti "griefing" design choices we are left with adventure mode or essentially PVP death match mode. I appreciate that there are people who mainly just want to test their build and skills against other players but that leaves a lot of unsatisfied people.
---
No, you’re right
---
I was in the same boat. I got it pretty quickly by travelling to Wavy Willard's up North, and server-hopping until I found a corpse near one of the cars. Took me only 5 or 6 hops.
---
Yup I'll be waiting and ready
---
Thanks I'll try that I've just been occasionally going to the locations hoping I'd find it
---
Because I want to adventure into your home
---
wait till you see a scorch beast do this, it is hilarious!
---
I mean the dev. team doesn't reply.
---
People lie on this forum every day, all of the time.
---
Yea did the verification and i think that was the last time i got an email from the. I liked the collector's edition. Tried to wear the helmet but i couldnt get it to fit properly lol so its back in the box. I might put it on display somewhere in the house lol. I wish i bought the collector's for 4 when it first came out.
---
Yep!
---
Nope ps4

Kill an intoxicated legendary deathclaw with a switchblade while wearing a swimsuit and a tin foil hat while using chems solo or in a group of other swim suited players who are starving and thirsty and only have chems and are strung out on overdrive. 10 atoms.  :)
---
A station with a gutsy/ hand duo would be perfect for banter and covering current events
---
Haha awesome.  I rocked that for a while
---
I would like to see this - adding you (Ingame name is different)

title: Why you should mix Nukashine and Daytripper

Lmao Bethesda isnt telling you how much to play, that is probably just you projecting. The scrip limit is for the economy. If there was no scrip limit then there would have been millions of 3* legendaries being added to the game already. Rarity and price of legendaries would plummet, and there would be no reason to even farm legendaries anymore because youd only make a few hundred caps on a 3*
---
I mean, I didn't like Mr. New Vegas too much (no substitute for Three-dog, or awkward Travis), but Mr. New Vegas basically an AI with a DJ personality, so it would fit quite well with Appalachia.  
---
Personally, I would like to also have a human radio personality that is like one of the few-remaining holdouts in Appalachia that avoided the plague, and tries to keep the spirits of the vault dwellers up.
---
Struggles. I’ve not switched worlds to find a friend! I’ve got headset muted because the DOGGO is going insane
---
*Laughs in Armour-Piercing Stabilised^3 .50 Cal*
---
I really, desperately wished that he was in the game somewhere, but I haven’t heard about anyone finding him.
---
It’s a little weird but basically: attaching foundations to ramps can sometimes cause the foundation to be placed where it usually isn’t possible ( Previous update allowed floating foundation as long as original piece is not). So these pieces become glitched and are unable to be removed. There doesn’t seem to actually be a solution for this sadly
---
* looks to the right *
---
As a huge red rocket fan, you should definatly open an etsy store for these, holy shit it's beautiful
---
So you participated in the RNG vendor, and are now salty that the gear you got was...random. Got it.
---
Its fallout...Live or die... asshole or not... its Fallout...
---
So your  big 3\* wood evaporated into a 1\* once the pill wore off?
---
And then youll be back on this sub in a few weeks complaining that no one will buy the 3* legendaries youve been farming for more than 500 caps because they are everywhere.
---
Sigh. Thanks :)
---
Can confirm the vanishing Gear Bug. Lost a T-51B Helmet, Torso, Right Leg. Relogging did not fix it, nor did it re appear in my stash. 
---
Notable circumstance: The Power armor chassis it was equipped on could not be placed and when dropped it finally spawned from inventory but it was empty. 
---
(On PS4)
---
Sometimes yeah but I don't usually farm one area I am usually out n about all over so I don't actually have the big issue.

Spears should stab AND swipe.
---
Not exactly the "weapon of your dreams"
---
Nah called playing the game. It’s not your Brahmin it’s a fallout game and I loot everything. The only thing you can do about it is cry on the internet
---
At least the settings, control assignments, etc. are not deleted when uninstalling through the launcher, so if you have pretty fast internet the reinstall is not so bad.
---
Fuckity fuck right off, you fucking whiny ignorant fuckwit.
---
I got 10 and they're regularly all full after I've been adventuring for a while.
---
Yes, i can oneshot supermuties too
---
I’m trying to stock up and make a food vendor but I need food😂
---
Server hop and it'll be back.
---
Well it was a vangurads with weight redux and AP refresh so I could a got some decent caps or a trade atleast
---
oh im ps4 forgot to mention that Im sorry
---
Check your weapon wheel. There's a bug where if you have more than one of the same weapon type favorited one will get replaced with other and one will be removed from the wheel on reload. I'd bet the game is switching to the vampire when you think it should be instigating. Then when you "switch back" to the instigating it works as expected.
---
It's annoying, to be sure.
---
Admittedly I’ve been drinking so maybe I’m just being stupid, but what do you mean “exceed 90% spoilage” in terms of the back pack and Good With Salt 2?
---
Does this mean stuff spoils extra fast or does it mean you can negate spoilage in general with rank 2 of the perk? 
---
Not too sure what the problem is that you’re explaining is so please dumb it down for me if need be :)
---
dude its not because its explosive you uninformed noob. its because your build is trash and you dont know how to pvp
---
Doesn't one-shot anything, just makes me feel good seeing high ballistic resist enemies get damaged real quick, and makes tagging easier, letting other people get hits in too.
---
Bless your heart.
---
Game is messed up besides that, from the last two updates anyway. I get booted constantly on top of a bunch of other problems.
---
Player Vending Machines - 1c each.
---
Does sound nice. My suggestion with 3\*/ wood armor is to scrip it before it reverts. At least then you get extra scrip out of the mess.
---
Well hope they ship soon, but I’m not really in a big hurry to get it myself. Can’t say I would really use it for anything. I have all the bags an luggage I need. Possibly use it for my skate or snowboarding helmets, but can’t see it.
---
This is why i told the overseer not to make you a dorm boss. Your proteges are not prepared for Appalachia at all.
---
I can find the same cap stash multiple days in a row and it still hasn't refreshed
---
For the first time all 3 animals lived.  My reward?  Recipe: Super Stimpack....sigh
---
No don’t I work the next three days 😂☹️
---
So it's only the wood armor then?
---
Question....   
---
Could others see your camp?    
---
Only asking because I've not been able to see my camp but others could...  
---
Either way thanks for posting / the info
---
All of this just works
---
He was probably starving and over encumbered..and your stove was right there enticing him
---
Just increase the stash size again. A separate weight limit will restrict the kinds of items people list for sale and create a new layer of complications.
---
Minimum wage sucks in this game! 😂😂😂
---
Check your volume and check your voice settings. Sometimes it helps just to switch stuff around and then back again. Make sure you set chat to area.
---
What Perks equipped?  
---
I've noticed and reported some issues with "Locked and Loaded" and it effecting other non-reloading animations
