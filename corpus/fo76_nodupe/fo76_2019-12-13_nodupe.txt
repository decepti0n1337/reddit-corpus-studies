Yeah, it’s the insult bot that can spawn near you and insult you.

Gorilla head you say? Wouldn’t that hurt?
---
probably said 'you have been insulted'
---
Anyone know how to build it? I got it but I can’t find it in my camp build menu
---
Just took a ride to the store and left my character at camp. I got back from the store and the second he stands up from the seat, 12.99 a month server crash. Im not calling them provate servers any more because if i call it a ‘12.99 a month’ server, itll remind me i will never get the true value out of that price point, whether they give me atoms or not
---
Good
---
Yep it’s not unusual.
---
Thanks for the tip!! I’ve only found  one Santa scorched and made a few gifts!

Ive lost the ‘characters’ tab again
---
It's under resources. It's with the collectron
---
Nah lowest it gets is 1400
---
Just got the frog.  PC large gift box.  No sloth.
---
Also got:. Squirrel, deathclaw, mirelurk hunter, fox, gorilla, brahmin and maybe a couple of others.
---
Can’t really build cities as much as homes/farms. I’ve recently finished building my magnum opus: a red brick manor with two floors, an external garage for crafting as a workshop space of sorts and then built a detached guest house! :) if you’re on ps4 I can set you up with some materials so you can build without the grind.
---
So they are more than 1400 for us normal peeps lol
---
Yea and for them I feel bad. Can't imagine the work load. Fingers always go to the leadership.
---
Become melee
---
Well with maxed unyielding bonus you only need 3 charisma and hard bargain to minimize prices. I find the vast majority of advanced players use unyielding armor.
---
Did you have Herd Mentality? Had the same problem, picked up Herd Mentality but it wasn’t showing up.. take a load of radaway and that should sort it.
---
At any robot vender. It's in misc. There's 3 kinds, they are expensive.
---
uhhhh what?
---
I had 4 pieces of unyielding and it was still 1500
---
that's really nice of you. if you do, i'll send you his gamertag.
---
Had to do some fiberglass last week... Not a fan! Hats off to you, somebody's gotta do it.
---
Haven’t tested but you should be able to get minimum prices even with 4 pieces using maxed hard bargain and grape mentats.
---
Looks like it but it may be attached to the +250 damage resist while reloading fix and they're planing on rolling that one back.
---
Oh that’s good. I’ve only been playing since patch 8. Can’t wait!
---
I found one on the green, under the white springs on the map, where Mr Messenger spawns. He didn't make it home, but almost did. I've also found a level 5 mirlurk there.
---
It’s not a big deal either way. Caps are plentiful
---
So my extra 100 lbs is toast?  Or it’s coming back?
---
Had that bug too, was showing lowered stats but not listed in mutations, cleared all my mutations and fixed it.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
gotten may dupes, no plasma grenade/mine plans yet tho :(
---
Maybe ammo that was glitched and you bought it from someone?
---
maybe? who knows with Bugthesda.
---
Damn.
---
Disconnected again from 12.99 a month server. Btw havent found a holiday scorched yet on this character.
---
Its 7:24 pm. Ill round down. It’s 7:20 pm, trying again.
---
Good job Vault Dweller. Vault-Tec is proud of you.
---
[removed]
---
Pretty sure there's a raider one in the datamines likely to come, assuming it will search for chems.
---
Not sure why I was thinking this was like a plan you learn.  I didn’t realize they were one use only.
---
I’m betting that the mothman plans will be worth a pretty penny in a few months
---
mind replying with your route or pming it? lol
---
If you have a gatling laser you can test, if you get more rounds after slotting the perk then it's working.
---
This. There's no argument for it other than "it makes more money" but AAA companies do it all the time. Apparently everything's on a predictable timer though so it's not like you're really missing out.
---
Yes. Enemies will attack your camp no matter the size. But you can build as little as you want. For awhile i only used my camp as a fast travel didnt build 1 thing.
---
I got it on my 1st large handcrafted gift.
---
copy that.
---
What the fuck.
---
I mained harpoon gun for few months. While using this weapon has severely dimnished my repair resources, which seemed infinite prior to using it, I was for sure able to take out 20-30 players before it broke down, each player dying in one shot, but each shot needing two more before crit loaded up. I made 70k caps in first three days of survival solely on harpoon gun. I haven't had to fix it after four magazines.
---
I run gunsmith 3 because gunsmith 5 couldn't be put anywhere in my perfected builds.
---
Is this still happening to you? I’ve had this problem for about 3 months. Contacted Bethesda and tried solutions. Nothing. Clip below showing mine:
---
https://youtu.be/KQHQIgaWgi8
---
My favorite line is definitely the "Due to the hardened nature of this unit's exterior, the action 'shake belly like bowl full of jelly' is unavailable at this time."
---
I guess your armor cant "break" if you can't reload, maybe that was their fix lol
---
Im not denying issues. Im chosing my perspective
---
Must be each pellet is considered a separate shot.
---
I mained harpoon gun for months and while it did break fast, it broke slow enough to take down 20+ players before it needed repairs.
---
Does anyone know if Christmas Scorched spawn on Private Worlds?
---
Definitely has lower tolerance since update IMO
---
It’s been awhile since I’ve played. I will let you know when I login again.
---
Fissure sites probably
---
I hate the smaller maps so much! I'm also a stealthy sniper type.
---
It’s an old bug that’s resurfaced, you actually still get the xp and quest rewards.  I checked today before and after turning in quests, I did receive xp and items
---
Glad someone got it lol
---
Are there areas you can build where AI won't attack your camp?
---
What armor do you use? Reloading fucks up armor prefixes now. 250DR fix has fucked up everything else.
---
They must've been Porchbeasts
---
Okay, that one got me
---
“Search for Christmas tree has failed. All nearby trees contain dangerously high levels of radiation.”
---
Nicely put together bar.  Consider posting to Fallout76settlements sub.
---
Learning where hotspots are all over the entire map and bouncing around those locations. There is no one place that is best.
---
For me it's going against op build or a group and giving them a hard time. Slaying accidental pvpers is not engaging, true that.
---
Always been like that
---
I use West Tek, and Fissure Prime.
---
Any fissure site will work, but I keep my tent at V9, so Prime is the one I go to.
---
I just got that plan in a gift
---
Always been like that.
---
Before you click on 'Private Worlds' does it say 'X All Friends' or 'X Team Only' at bottom of screen?
---
Thank you for your Fallout 1st money
---
There are three logical choices. If you're building your main, it needs 8 int to craft everything.
---
If you're playing heavy, you might wanna get your int as far as 11.
---
For any other choice, it is 3. Enough to repair your stuff alone if you swap perk cards, and the bare minimum you need.
---
I play gunsmith 3 when I'm lazy and need rage 3 when I'm in a troublesome situation. If you're not playing heavy weapons 11int build, demolition expert is waste of perk card points.
---
I'll help you. Its double xp weekend. So, we will get you a few levels.
---
That’s the one that cracked me up
---
Full stats kick in when nerd-rage does
---
It's really not a big deal if you build a basic camp like you are describing.  Your income of the junk you will need to repair even the entire base will outstrip the cost to repair it by a massive amount if you make even a paltry effort.  
---
Beyond that if you want you can setup turrets once you know the direction enemies attack from and this will usually minimize any repairs.
---
Probably not but away from more dangerous enemies a couple turrets are all you'll need.
---
Plenty of people didn’t, and might not. That said, I think you might be able to sell the actual gifts post December for a bit.
---
This is 2019, supposedly men like "Jessica Yaniv" can have periods now so eggs aren't much of a stretch.
---
X team only and we are on a team in the main menu
---
Thx. Beats following people around n shooting at their enemies
---
Hopefully it's to fix all of our armor.
---
There is an age old bug with Herd Mentality.  If you are not in a group, it does not show up in your mutations list, but you still get the negatives. 
---
This happened to me once.  I was running around without Starched Genes on, and picked it up on accident. 
---
Took me about 2 months to figure it out.   
---
I had to rad shower all my mutations away, then reapply. 
---
I never take off starched genes now, ever.   Just so that I dont accidentally get this PoS herd mentality bullshit again.
---
That's basically how you level up when you are low level. Lol. Get a shot on a big enemy and stand back. Cheap but effective.
---
I’ve been role playing as an HOA inspector. I would have a field day with all those holiday violations lol
---
I use Luck of the Draw and this seems negate current condition glitch and I've heard Quick Hands can do the same for the reload glitch..
---
Where have you been finding the scorched that drop them?
---
Ahh haha! that's fantastic :)
---
Right!
---
I love that every time I've collected from Santatron so far, there's been 'raw fertilizer' or coal, or both. He's giving me shit and coal. Now that's funny. It's also cool to get occasional toys and food. The Giddy Up Buttercup was some nice scrap.
---
You want fireproof + dense torso mod.  This will negate most or possible all non legacy explosive damage, and in a lot of cases you don't need all 3 ranks of fireproof (iirc).  
---
No amount of defense will negate legacy explosive damage, though the above combo will mitigate a fair amount of it and you will definitely want all 3 ranks of fireproof.
---
Not really. Stick to the forest. Low level enemies and a few turrets will handle them.
---
But it’s double xp!
---
You can get Dense. It is better than padded. What you have should be enough unless you are going bloodied. I don’t know if Lone Wanderer works on self damage, might be worth testing.
---
where i can get the dense torso mod ? never saw that
---
sweet ty for the heads up, can't be anything other than a fix for the armor/reload bug so that's good news assuming it doesn't cause even worse issues :P
---
My other guys is lvl 100+ melee build and all I have is ranged weapon so I'm trying to make a ranged guy. But grinding early on is so tedious
---
I got one from a legendary at Morgantown airport during the cargo bot event...   and then the vendor sold me the wrapping papers to craft my own at a tinkers bench...
---
Do we know what the spawn rate for them is?
---
Me and my wife are having the same problem PS4
---
Dense mod works for my TS Auto grenade launchers, even when someone runs between me and SBQ and bonus helps protect against her attack
---
He talks way to often. He did make me laugh at first, but he talks constantly. He hasn't found any presents yet, and if he hasn't found one by Monday I'm going to delete him. So far all the scrap bots are so annoying. If he only talked when you clicked on him he would be so awesome.  😕
---
i am 3 rank  fireproof  and 4 rank  Lone Wanderer
---
thanks a lot, but, where i can get the dense mod ?
---
They spawn as legendary enemies so anywhere you can find scorched you have a chance to find some.
---
I think you're confusing two different things. 1) you can craft gifts rught now. 2) you can get a skin for your loot bag that looks like a present.
---
I sell all 19 serums at 250caps per.  I keep no less than 10 of each for bulk customers.  I play often but usually evening PST.  IGN is same as reddit.
---
It definitely breaks really fast now.  From 150% cnd I can fire about 9 shots before it breaks
---
My assumption is this is the rollback they announced with ITV earlier. 
---
Hopefully its really a reversion.
---
Fissure sites for me with all the Christmas scorched and legendary scorch beasts has my character loaded farming the presents. 
---
Granted mostly 1/2 star, will try a sbq later and let her live to see what she puts out with the Christmas scorched.
---
Man that is awesome. Happy holidays vault dweller!!
---
Thanks for the tip, I will have to try this.
---
Ok one of the other comments asked about before you join private world does it say at bottom of screen for you it'll be square team only or square all friends. I switched it to all friends and it hasn't kicked my friend yet. 
---
Still and issue either way because we both on a team before joining server.
---
You must be using legacy explosive weapons.  Energy weapons and Explosive = you die if youre close.
---
If you are using standard post legacy explosives, what you have should be enough.
---
I can dump an entire clip from a TSE Mini at my feet and I take near 0 damage, i only know its hitting me because seredipity goes off.   I use fireproof and a leather chest without dense or padded, and I live through it. 
---
If I pull out the TSE Gat Plas, I die after 4 shots.
---
right now your best option is finding it in a christmas gift.  Otherwise there will be a lot of server hopping in your future.   
---
Padded works just fine though if you are not using legacy guns.
---
I'm on a team in private worlds atm
---
Happy your not having an issue, wish I wasn't, PS4 by the way
---
Ok, I missed something. So the wrapping paper is to make a gift for yourself?
---
Anyone got the “icicle lights” plans yet?!?
---
Changing it to all friends seemed to work thanks for bring that to my attention still being on a team in main menu should work with team only.
---
Fissure sites seems to have the best yield for me.  But went to Morgantown and got 4 there alone without the event, and got 3 in big bend tunnel. 
---
But I’m not sure if the large presents are only high level regions or not yet.  Morgantown airport was low level scorch with small presents.
---
yes i am :)
---
Yea plus as a bloodied melee I actually have a use for my 150+ radaways from sbq farming lol finally able to use them!
---
I had difficulty getting friends in let alone team...Xbox. What a waste of money. Cant even do the events with broken armour affects. Let down by Bethesda....again...
---
Check your aid tab.
---
I never thought about favoriting power armor pieces to switch back and forth like that. So you could have a protocoled and a jetpack torso and switch as needed. That’s clever man.
---
I did. Not there
---
Disagree it’s been a gold mine for me as a bloodied melee. You don’t have to kill the scorch beasts just stay sneaked and your fine. The raids however... it’s good to have too many radaways hahah
---
Because fucking people continue to support them financially.
---
The patch notes will explain it more clearly, but the santatron only acts as a collection if you own a collectron, otherwise it’s just a santatron
---
I got 3 on my first and only run through there so far, I went to wavy hills after and only got 1 there pfft..
---
Didn't have it disappear but these gifts a very few and far between. I've seen maybe 3 Christmas Scorched and all 3 have small gifts that gave junk.
---
Okay gotcha. So if you dont own a collectron do you figure after the holidays itll just be aesthetic and wander around but not collect stuff?
---
Yep. According to the notes they’ll be useless besides being awesome afterwards.
---
PC here. Sorry man
---
Really ive been on for a hr now and have over 30+ already keep server hopping n fast traveling
---
Set your camp machine up near whitesprings station.   there's a tinkers bench and a stash box there you can always use and it's virtually guaranteed that other people will have camps in walking distance.  so you can leech of them, use their camp stuff, and you get to see other people's camp builds and buy things at their shops.
---
I did that one really annoying event with the missiles and never ending scorch beasts and it is perfect now
---
copy that. i got one from collisiom course. was a regular holiday gift
---
This is true except my turret's worst enemy at the moment is my other turret :(
---
Yeah that's all I care about :), thanks a lot Cap!
---
scrap the armor in question and in time you will unlock it.  Also, some npc or even player vendors may sell it.  Which vendor depends on the type of armor, use google to suss that out.
---
Does anyone know where to get the "empty can" it looks like a open sardine can.. you can google it (fallout 76 empty can) but I haven't been able to find the location... I found it once and knew I should of written it down in my 'Junk notes &amp; their locations' notepad when I found it..
---
Yet another bug from patch-agedon, I'd guess.
---
*Beth Dev 1*: "You can now make holiday gifts in Fallout 76 at the Tinker's Bench!" 
---
*Test User 1*: "Cool! But, where do I get wrapping paper..."
---
*Beth Dev 2*: "Oh that. Yeah, I made it so players have to spend 1500+ caps to buy wrapping paper!"
---
*Test User 1:*  \*stunned silence\*
---
Todd Howard: "What a great idea! Release it!"
---
\*Everybody claps at Todd Howard's brilliance\* 
---
/s
---
Do events with scorched or just head down to the cranberrie bog
---
Yeah I been on for over and hour and a half and only got 3 small gifts. Haven't been server hopping though. What are some places you've gone to?
---
You're not confusing it with .308...?
---
Place your bets, what do they break this time? I say stimpacks will now take health rather than restore it.
---
Not that I found.
---
I really hope so...if not...I won't be continuing any subscription with fallout 76. Already lost one day of the new event...and double xp...yeah...lil peeved to say the least.
---
most of time ppl won't sell the stuff in caps that i wanted...=/
---
Just rebuild it dude
---
More likely it's royalty free music that Bethesda took. Yet another sign of the high quality of 76.
---
Thanks. Just went and cranked out like 10! I’m going to every train station now! Lol and I wonder if all the ws vendors have the wrapping paper too???
---
I'll stick to the manor
---
Nice 👍🏻
---
Nope
---
Be sure to throw the chemist perk card on x2 the handmade gifts
---
What do they do, I didn't get the memo.
---
Wait you can craft presents? Lol at which bench?
---
All over the map literally
---
supposedly learning camp plans increases your budget, so if that's correct then you should be gtg :P
---
Yes. And the chemist perk makes 2 everytime! That’s crazy
---
How do you get wrapping paper? Is it a drop from scorched?
---
Only instanced location I can think of with large volumes of enemies is vault 94 but there's not a single scorched in there.
---
Yeah but I tried to add the mounted creatures and I couldn’t after I learned the plans. I’m at max. :(
---
Well actually they go into aid so you could give them to people. Might as well open them and give them plans if you already know them tho
---
What system are you on? I’m farming real good on xbox
---
Don't see the spear plan. But Tomahawk is there so that's still a win.
---
Glass Caverns and Morgantown airport have been the best for me.
---
Yeah I got 2. Used one and I'm putting one up for sale/trade soon
---
Thanks all, I'm just not hitting like usual over the past couple of days, so I looked closer at stats and thought that could be it 🤷
---
How did you get it?!?!??
---
I see it as a two way street.  They need to make money.  In addition to their own mistakes, all the bad press and players with 2,000 hours telling people "the game is terrible, don't buy it" has hurt profits.  In turn, they are looking for other ways to profit.  They don't want to invest more into the game because the return hasn't been there.
---
They dug their own grave but the community was glad to put the nail in the coffin and throw dirt on top.  Yet many of these people are still playing, even though they're telling other people not to...So did these negative nancy's climb in the grave and start throwing dirt on top of themselves?
---
25k worth of high value wrapping paper and then used the chemist perk to make x2 of each. So I opened 44 holiday gifts
---
You can gain access to Vault 79 through the Pawn Shop mission
---
I went and bought a bunch of wrapping paper for this reason. And the chemist perk doubles them!!!!
---
Buy it at vendors
---
there is a setting somewhere because I had an issue last night joining a friend. he said "let me change the setting and try again." and it worked. I have no idea what the setting was. I guess it is new with this last patch .
---
This is it. It costs a lot to license out music. Even older music can command a high price if the copyright's still up and it's popular enough. When Obsidian was working on New Vegas, they said they could a whole other game with the money it would cost to license Elvis.
---
The only music they've added since launch is the cover of Ring of Fire (probably recorded at the same time as Country Roads), and Atom Shop music which is definitely just a library of stock music, which is much cheaper.
---
If you want to mix up the music in 76, mute the game's OST and put on your own playlist. I recall a few posts where people made their own Fallout-themed Spotify playlists, even a holiday one.
---
Nevermind then. I didn't think it was supposed to have that effect since it doesn't actually shoot bullets.
---
Thanks
---
Not goodbye
---
I've gotten 1 large holiday so far, 7 holiday, and 4 small holiday. After opening it, it didnt seem any better stuff than the other ones though
---
I’ve gotten 2 👍🏻
---
I have but tbh I don’t remember it having anything extra fancy in it. From Morgantown airport, non event
---
Ok
---
Cry
---
Dang, I've gotten ~5 medium and 9 small but no larges :(
---
Yeah. Anything that uses solid ammo can have explosive
---
Fuck me...
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds
---
Morgantown Airport 
---
Wavy Willard's Water Park
---
Valley Galleria
---
Big Bend Tunnel
---
Camden Park
---
Point Pleasant
---
Just to name a few.
---
Morgantown airport for sure. I almost was slaughtered by 3 of them after starting a new alt character.  Had 5 total inside.
---
Congratulations. I figure I’ve done BBot about 14 million times with no luck. Some day...
---
they better fix my plumbis
---
Yes there is multipie new plans including ICiCLE LIGHTS!!! and moutned heads!!! What else have you got??
---
They said SCORCHED, not LEGENDARY SCORCHED! FUCK YOU BETHESDA! Then again why am I surprised. This isn't the first time they've lied to us OR ripped us off...
---
Sounds like someone wanting to piggy back off of others. Do your own hard work dude.
---
No you because this game gonna get shut down like Legends did. mmw
---
Power has to go straight to each switch individually, then from each switch to the door.
---
:( where is the cookout?!
---
Fixers and handmades are the best
---
I gotten two and they contained pure trash. Sugar bombs, random toys and the stingwing and bloatfly plans that have been dropping from sings and things for months. Super disappointing.
---
Does the fixer only come in a level 35?
---
It comes at level 45 aswell iirc
---
It could be fun to roam the wasteland. I have a character who is a bit of a wandering trader. Add me if you are willing to enjoy the company of a non-mic grenadier who likes to make things explode.
---
I'm being for real Bethesda is ripping y'all they said that scorched would drop gifts and be dressed as Santa bethesda lied to yall only the legendary scorched will drop gifts and be dressed as Santa
---
nvm, that still didn't work lol, I must be really bad at this
---
I’ve gotten one but nothing good was in it.
---
And then they bring them back for a limited time. It's one of the ways they get people to spend cash in the atom shop instead of just taking their time to save up from the challenges. I find it perfectly acceptable because they're just inessential cosmetic items. It also makes those items a little rarer in the game, since people can't just buy them any time they want.
---
It's a free to play online game, they need to make money to cover the upkeep costs of the servers and to continue development on the game. I have an issue with Fallout 1st, the scrapbox, and the increasing number of utility items in the AS, but certainly not limited edition cosmetic/collector's items.
---
Yeah. Not as much xp. But I'm still leveling pretty quickly just running back and forth in big bend at level 285
---
I've gotten a good 4 or so from my 1.5 hour farming run. I also crafted 20 of them
---
Oh ffs. Not everything is a conspiracy against the players. 
---
It’s not like there is a finite amount of scorched out there and we are all competing to kill them before they’re gone. We should have three weeks, if you can’t find a good spot on a public server than move. It’s no different then anything else in this game.
---
Full auto BE railway is amazing. One mag dump to kill a SB.  Ammo is cheap, just steel.
---
Dang, that must have been expensive af! Thats like 16000 caps on wrapping paper. Just wondering, how many "Christmas Plans" have you gotten (Santa crash and icicle)
---
The larg gifts are 1400 caps with 19 chr and hard barging r3 idk about the others
---
I’m on.  I think I messaged the correct person. Not sure.  My GT is Arcadiouse.
---
Only gotten 1 icicle light, but they are really cool looking
---
Big Bend Tunnel has been my go to. I’m always guaranteed 3-5 presents and so far I’ve gotten some really good wall mounts from it.
---
Ok thanks, time to spend my life savings on wrapping paper XD
---
You can get fixer from encrypted event
---
Dang ok thanks, I'll be trying to get the Christmas Plans all weekend
---
Or old players who didn’t get their scorched vaccine in time.
---
You did well finding that many high quality gifts, I've only found 2 so far, heaps of small ones though
---
Great job man
---
Oh hey
---
dude they've been using stock music since Fallout 3
---
Why are you yelling?
---
CAPS LOCK
---
Your welcome
---
There sorry about that
---
I got a ton earlier. But it didn’t pop up on my recent session, so who knows.
---
It’s in the title, they crafted them
---
All the time.  If I'm hiding in a good spot, I absolutely want to see if anyone is coming up behind me.  Most of the time they will run right past me without even noticing.
---
Power plants are solid also
---
Watoga civic center is a good place - got three already in there
---
There’s a spreadsheet of the data mined drop rates for each type of gift floating around somewhere
---
Disagree. The map is huge. Plenty of places to go to with scorched. You don’t need 1st.
---
I also read in another thread that it's chance for a plan, guaranteed plan, and guaranteed plan with a chance for a 2nd plan for small, holiday (med), and large respectively
---
Yea same here! I saw someone post it after I crafted like 10k worth!!! But it does work for sure, it puts a x2 next to them. I’m sure that’s wrong so maybe try to craft as much as you can today lol
---
10 comments in and you all have given me good advice to think on during the reinstall and a fresh set of eyes to discover the tapes of lore which i somehow missed. Thanks all

Honestly, the ONLY reason I still play atm is the friends I've made. I'm fed up with Bugthesda breaking literally everything, and trying to dip into my wallet every time they think they can, so I highly doubt I'll give them any money in the near future. This game has ruined my opinion of Bethesda though. I have lost all respect for the company that I used to tell everyone about for making games with heart, and soul, while other companies made broken trash to make a quick buck..... They could announce a solid gold power armor set to be given to every player, and because of recent history I would expect it to come broken, and to have a thousand microtransactions tied to it.
---
If you have discord or able to download it, I'm getting a bunch of people together to help set up this operation! 
---
Let me know if you cant download or have other complications
---
I’ve gotten killed while entering power armor 🤷‍♂️
---
They aren't anymore.
---
If you still haven't found out about it, watch juiceheads video on it. He splits it up with how to figure it out in the beginning and spoilers at the end.
---
In nuclear winter? I guess it was a bug or something.
---
They never said all scorched would drop gifts... that would be insane.
---
That's a good thing to hear however ignore all of us. Haha Find something in the game you enjoy doing and see how far you can go. It's your game after all. 
---
I take pride in building camps on unmapped prefab buildings seeing how I can convert them into fun living functional living spaces.
---
I don't know what a Fallout title feels like. You mean top down like Fallout 1 and 2?
---
Pretty much all of the military locations in the Cranberry Bog will have Scorched, and Distant Thunder will have a lot of them too.
---
whats is last floor in morgan town
---
Yes they are rare, but drop good stuff. This event is so long, we are all going to be swimming in easy scrip. Love it.
---
Sounds like you haven’t gone anywhere with scorched... because anywhere they spawn i see a bunch it seems.
---
It shoots a projectile, it’s basically a huge bullet.
---
I have 1st and almost never use my private world. I had 0 trouble finding unlimited Scorched in the Cranberry Bog and Mire.
---
That might work. I’d have to see what it looked like. Thanks.
---
You wanna feel superior. That's ridiculous.
---
In just can't stand this hate culture. How hard thing people is make the art, design and engineering to a project like this?
---
The technology is astounding. A few hiccups are expected.
---
The game is fun for me. And it cost me less than 0.5 dollars by hour played. After wastelanders I could expect the game cost me less than 0.25 dollars by hour. I understand people give thanks for the project buying "merchandise" in the atom shop. Or using their budget to videogames in the only game they play.
---
This is a game. One to expand lore from previous entries. With the same gameplay loop from previous BGS games: "kill, loot, return". I like survival, and fo76 is the only one doing it right for me. It has lore, limited PvP and marvelous world building.
---
The game have issues. But is fun to play. If you play. But a lot of people are just reading (or watching YT) about playing. The meta gaming is always the same. It can be fun, but very few games can be played for a long time following the meta because they turned easy for meta gamers and hard for casual gamers.
---
However, how can people play (any game) more of 300 hours? People are playing 4 hours daily! How can they have time for family, friends and work? This is the people I see talking about any game. IRL gamers I met can play (weekly) 10 hours max. A game can be fun, but obviously it can't satisfy you completely.
---
Just find yourself a good junkies weapon then get addicted to 5 different chems (usually takes spamming five of the same chem to become addicted). I think for every addiction you get a 10% damage bonus maxing out at 50% with 5 addictions. It's a low risk high reward build in my opinion. I run it myself with a Junkies Faster Firerate Handmade it's very good.
---
I’m not sure the correct term, but a “rollback” has a different connotation when it comes to online gaming.  So I’d say it was a poor choice of words.  Maybe “revert” the +250 changes.

Proof of Plasma Grenade plans. From my lvl 21 character, who used the tinker bench at Whitespring Station. I got both of the listed plans (in the upper right corner) in one Large gift that I made myself. 1300 caps Well spent.
---
I mean a post apocalyptic RPG, I feel that 76 has little to no RPG mechanics.
---
I absolutely will! Bc I was going to end up spending allll my caps on high quality paper lol
---
Do addictions have negative effects and do they go away over time/death?
---
I’m just here for the chicks... oh, and the beer. Don’t forget the beer.
---
It'll likely be fixed in tomorrow's maintenance....
---
Don't you just love trying to be a sarcastic twat only to be made to look stupid?
---
As I mentioned elsewhere, the main issue is the title of this discussion which is very misleading without the context of Bethesda’s post.
---
The negative effects differ depending on which chem your addicted to. The negative effects are minimal mostly only subtracting a special or two per addiction. Worth it though. Addictions are permanent so long as you don't use addictol.
---
But I want to like it, I bought it over the first Free Trial they had and fell in love, then after completing it, it felt empty, like other than launching nukes theres nothing else, now as I said in above replies, I dont have a group to play with on it. My buddies prefer Rust or DayZ to Fallout 76, which is a same because I know one of them would fall for this game, I do mistaking blame the game for my lack of play buddies but still, I want to like it. Really bad, which is why I asked this question, not to have yall tell me to not play it, I liked it for the first couple hours, I just want to know what keeps you guys going after the fact.
---
I'll believe it when it actually is fixed.
---
For months they have promised to fix a bunch, claiked they have fixed stuff, only to reveal that fuck all was fixed.
---
I found 1 gift and crafted 12 more with wrapping paper from the vendors. Using chemist while creating guarantees 2 gifts, so I ended up with 25.
---
Also the observatory in the savage divide
---
Cheers, the chemist perk works ? Got to try that
---
Haven't learned it yet, but you can find pics. It looks like a mounted trophy but it's Santa's legs sticking out as though he crashed through your wall.
---
What happened?
---
Yeah. He straight up says there are no in world clues for the packages locations. It’s all from data mining.
---
See. This "has little to no RPG mechanics" argument I often see is bunk. 
---
Half the time people are referring to Bethesda streamlining their stats system. Which is a build mechanic. Not an RPG mechanic. 
---
There's also this obnoxious idea that "More complicated....More stats = better"
---
You play a vault dweller. You venture out into the wasteland. You grow. You get better at things. Develop new abilities. Master new things. 
---
Pretty classic RPG.
---
Christ. Even building has an RPG feel. You start of with a small unrefined ability to build. And as you adventure. As you find new things. You can build more and more elaborate camps.
---
I'm on ps4 if someone wants to play on a private server.
---
Thanks...that's actually disappointing, was hoping more for a sleigh scene.
---
I will eat your soul...
---
Ight out of all the comments this is the one I dislike. This has nothing to do with feeling superior. Fuck your hate culture. I didnt say anything about the tech, I said that after you play through the game its empty. I have many games over 300 hours, because I like to game. I enjoy it. I sunk hours into this game aswell. But for this type of game that this game is advertising itself as it should keep me playing after the main quests. I know people worked hard, people worked hard on Elder Scrolls Legends and look what happened. On the note of "expanding" lore, last I read this game broke some lore that was previously established in previous Fallouts. I didnt come here to argue, I just wanted your input, Im not saying anyones better for liking it, I bought it so I thought it was fun at some point, the problem is that the fun wore out far to quickly. And I cannot stand Nuclear Winter soley because we have way to many BR games at this time and NW doesnt add anything of value to the genre of BR.
---
Someone said it's related to nuclear winter. If you play that mode it will complete your dailies
---
What are the best addictions to have the give the least negative effects?
---
I want them fixed too, but i wont let them ruin my good time!
---
Dude just be happy something was done in our favor  they do something good and you find the negative in it
---
1 was found, the other 24 were crafted.
---
Completely different issue. I’m referring to the daily quests, not the challenges. 
---
The NW issue is if you play NW first before adventure, after a daily reset, your daily challenges will be auto completed. 
---
I’m referring to the daily quests you get in adventure like ecological balance, heart of the enemy. You can do them and you’ll still get the XP and rewards, but the screen that pops up showing the quest being completed and the rewards you earned doesn’t show.
---
Still very rare so far.
---
So I can show off my hoarding problem? *screams in look at my 4 fuzzy outfits* assuming this means you could display apparel..
---
Yup. Guaranteed 2 every time.
---
Just tried it, thanks :)
---
I have enough steel but not enough scrip. Give me a few days to get the scrip and if Bethesda still hasn't done anything for him I will be able to hook him up with a set.
---
This is relevant to my interests.
---
Totally understandable. I’m new to Reddit. I’ll try not to make the same mistake thanks for your guidance
---
All plans 15 caps or free. I never sell any plans for more than 15 caps unless it was a serum recipe.. but let's face it who sells those..
---
It's nice that so many players are seeing them.  It would even be nicer if the rest of us could see them too, instead of relying on the vapidly horrendous RNG drop rates to give us any stinking break.
---
I’m new to reddit too.  I only joined due to FO76.  I’m getting too old for this stuff. 😜
---
I got 3 pieces from about a total of 8 boxes. Must be luck or not the rare ones.
---
Can you please find me the location of the "empty can" it looks like a open sardine can.. you can google it but no location. I just found it like 2 weeks ago but forgot to write it down in my notes
---
No problem! Don't forget to sell shit back to the vendors shop your caps don't disappear. I sold a bunch of shit to get them to zero, bought wrapping paper until they got closer to 1400,and then sold stuff (mainly serums) to keep them from maxing out.
---
It brings the 1400 cap wrapping paper down to roughly 900 caps of you have things to sell.
---
" You play a vault dweller. You venture out into the wasteland. You grow. You get better at things. Develop new abilities. Master new things. " Wheres the decisions? I said nothing about more stats or being more complicated. But it stands that this game has zero dialogue and everything you do in the game has 0 effect unless its the makers of the game giving a special deal for items to buy with Atoms. Rust has everything you named. You play a naked. You venture into the world. You grow. You get better at things. Develop new items. Master crafting. You can build! But its not an rpg. This game isnt an Rpg, and I want someone to prove it is. And this comment didnt. When I say RPG Im thinking of Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Kingdom Come, Fallouts 1-NV hell even Fallout 4. Games that make me feel that what I do in the game matters. This game makes me feel like a molerat running around waiting to get killed. Which if thats what you are into then fine, but its no RPG.
---
Also, the one for I got from a scorched was a 3 star legendary at Poseidon. He gave me a 2 star level 1 regenerating +1 END leather armor piece. If anyone needs it for their alt I'm open to any reasonable offer, otherwise I'll just scrip it.
---
I’d say luck, I’ve gotten a couple, but the ones I got were all ones I’ve already gotten.  Like the hydraulic bracers.

Junkie's is my favorite all-around build. Generally, I just walk or run everywhere and don't worry much about stealth. I have a one-handed Junkie's weapon that I've hit 6,000 with while not in stealth and using Power Armor.
---
Run it through a doorway &amp; then swap the doorway back to a solid wall
---
If you attach a conduit to a poster on the wall then connect a wire to that conduit you can move the poster with the conduit and itll attach anywhere. 
---
OR just through the wall with the power conduit plans.

Been playing for a few hours tonight the game is just flat out fun. Especially hunting down holiday scorched
---
Don't just join the world, have the person already in the world invite the other one.
---
I had a problem like that 7 months ago, I was ready to quit, posted in here and as it turned out I had too many friends.
---
Make sure before you create a private server that it says friends and not team only. I’m on Xbox and sometimes I have to join via the Xbox menu, sometimes I have to join public and then the private via the social menu.
---
I found it hilarious when he says “If you are unsatisfied with your gift, please contact your nearest Rob Co. This unit is not authorised to make exchanges” and then he gives me shit. Literally.
---
I’m in the same boat; love the crossbow. I’m hoping with Wastelanders they do the compound bow we’re getting justice but like you said there needs to be more beneficial ammo types for it like with the syringer
---
Wait, no kidding... friends list can bog it down? I'll have to give that a shot and clean up my list then. Thanks
---
So you wrap and make gifts randomly and then can just open them for stuff?
---
My cynical prediction is that the game just keeps getting better from here on out. And there will always be expensive appealing things to buy that I will most certainly purchase
---
Someone on here said hotfixes dont need certification. I have no idea either way.
---
is there any rewards for doing this?
---
I wish there were more ammo types in general, like dragons breath for shotguns or hollow point rounds, like new vegas did.
---
LOL yes
---
Exactly
---
All of the faction-based robo vendors sell 3 different levels of gift wrap. Buy them, craft gifts at the tinker bench (1 wrap and 2 adhesive), and then open the gifts to get rewards. If you have the chemist park you get 2 gifts for some reason.
---
Is not quite as satisfying as hunting scorched because you don't get bonus legendary stuff, but it is a friggin amazing cap sink for people who are close to max caps.
---
Anywhere Scorched can spawn there's a chance one or more will be holiday legendaries.
---
You'd love my unconventional source of mulch then. Got to clean up those meat piles showhow.
---
Sorry, there is just a LOT of negativity in most posts like this. 
---
Sounds like you need new friends!
---
Start a new character with a different build. After 165 levels I started over and learned so much more about the game. I still haven't done all of the quests for my 2nd character and I'm around level 130 on her. Do the side quests. Do the dailies. Do the daily and weekly and combat atom challenges. Do all the tadpole quests.  Try to get the perfect set of armor. I spend so much time just vendor hopping honestly. Try to own every plan. Theres so much I WANT to do in the game, not just the story, ya know?
---
When you choose play and it shows you the three options, highlight but dont click private. Below the box you will see some options. Change team only to all friends and go to the world. Anyone on your friends list should be able to join you.
---
Devs: let's create a giant cap sink
---
Me: fuck Yeah, something to spend caps on.
---
Hell yeah I regret it. This was the first game I ever pre-ordered and they sure taught me a lesson. No endgame, crap support, breaking the game with every patch, straight lying to us about cosmetics. I seriously won't be purchasing another Bethesda game again. I don't care if starfield comes with a gold brick, a pound of Sour Diesel, and a blowjob. Bethesda can fuck right off.
---
I had one disappear from inventory as well I also killed one in a bike zone and he was empty,like some one looted him already but I was alone
---
If anyone obtained a clean rip of the dance audio from the game files, I would really appreciate posting a link to it. I made it into a ringtone with sound taken from a youtube video but it's definitely not as clear as it could be. Sadly I'm on console or I would do it myself.
---
Glass cavern seems to keep respawning enemies in the last section on Xbox by the way
---
Yeah that's how it goes. Same stuff happening where I work. Teamwork does exist here but the majority are hard headed won't admit when they are wrong and won't stop shoving it in everyone's faces when they correct. 
---
Wish it was simple. 
---
My life slogan has always been "Don't be a dick".
---
That's what I was missing!!  thanks!
---
You're right.  I wasn't aware that you could buy the wrapping paper from robovendors.  Now that I do, I've spent way too many caps doing so.  haha
---
The tunnels sucked for me too.
---
&gt; But it does look like PA plans are on the table so that's cool
---
Can confirm. I've pulled a T51 leg and a core assembly so far.
---
One I found was holding a Grognak's Axe in a santa suit.... It was hilarious.
---
I couldn't spend that on a boat. I'm too busy paying snap-on all that money! 😂
---
Search the subreddit for "junkies" and you'll see tons of guides. 2 out of my 5 characters are junkies and it's a good build
---
Grafton now has a pawn shop if you're interested in that 👀
---
Surface To Air is awesome right now. Did one at just west of the Steakhouse, and I got two Santascorched, 4 Legendary Scorchbeasts, and a fucking Sheepsquatch. It was *nuts.*
---
They drop the weapon when the arms are crippled and shotguns are great at crippling
---
You can view it under wall decor in your camp.
---
Perhaps it's a sign to start seeing other people?
---
Exactly what I came to check to see! Thank you for sharing!!
---
They sure do. One dropped a non-legendary Grognak's earlier. I haven't even seen one of those.
---
With max charisma they're 1400, and you can sell stuff to get 350 of that back, so the net cost on HQ paper is 1050.  Also, if you have the chemist park you get 2 every time you craft. I made 24 of them so far for less than 13k.
---
2. Dissappointed
---
Just because you're single doesn't mean other people should be.
---
They said they had been working on a hotfix for the problems with armor not working properly.
---
You can go all the way to the new vault door, past the elevator in the mountain, if you do it. I recommend a guide tho
---
&gt; That said, I think you might be able to sell the actual gifts post December for a bit.
---
Yup. They weigh .01 each, so it's going to be easy too stock up and sell them later.
---
Not yet &amp; I've been on for 4 hours
---
Yeah, food and drink, word's getting around. Same with armor not working properly. They said there's a hotfix tomorrow (and Ladydevann was saying they were working on a hotfix for those problems) so hopefully these two are linked
---
Played for a while today nothing yet a lot of gifts from scorched tho.
---
Thanks, I forgot that you could sell stuff back. Is that 350 per present or 350 between the two presents you get with the chemist perk?
---
Honestly don't understand the frenzy. I saw the list on another post. Nothing gave me more than a semi. Icicle lights look nice, the deer head for a wall, the rest is meh.
---
Nope ive been on for about 6 hours
---
If you're on PC, try disabling better inventory.
---
Whatsup with chemist?
---
Nah just random weapons like boxing gloves and golf clubs. Coal and raw fertilizer. Although I’m not complaining because I’m getting mad presents from Morgantown airport lol
---
Per wrapping paper. When you sell something they add 25% of the caps back to their pool, so when you buy the paper for 1400 it adds roughly 350 back to their pool.
---
Shush!
---
Crafted 2, got the Santa crash on the second one.
---
Call and poop
---
Run into one almost every fissure farming scorchbeast.
---
Negative, but I have not been good this year.
---
Dude.....every time you post I laugh, then worry that I’m going to see breaking news about police uncovering your den of horrors someday.
---
Not really the point of this thread, but good for you I guess
---
There's several ways. This is a placeholder until I get home and can type up a real response.
---
There was a bug in update 16. Armor is broken. Supposedly hotfix tomorrow will fix it.
---
🤔
---
I want the Mrs. Claus outfit, it looks cute... I don't think it was released last year though. But that blue outfit with snowflaked was in the store last xmas, I've seen it in some players before.
---
That's super helpful, thanks for the tip!
---
My excavator pa doesn't give me any carry boost,how does everyone keep getting extra carry weight with them
---
Nice! Did you place the Santa crash? I was wondering what it looked like
---
No I haven’t yet
---
I did, are you on Xbox?
---
I'll let someone else answer the handmade question because I'm an unarmed junkie. 
---
The downside of being a junkie is the withdrawl effects that your addictions have (negative points to certain special). It's important to select the addictions that will affect your build the least.
---
I feel like my thirst and hunger are going down really quickly now. I've been running out of food even, this patch is a mess. Hopefully, they will roll back tomorrow... I mean it's not only the gear system, it's also the carry weight, effects, and weapon systems too.
---
Like toxic goo and handmade glue.
---
Good idea for even a present that you could leave stuff in but people would probably just fill them with the crap from their inventory they want rid of like mini nukes missiles and syringe ammo
---
But we have 100% of our health.
---
That look just scares me.
---
Send a team invite while still on the start screen, my fiance and i are in a private world now after joining a team on the start screen, and then team leader joins a private server.
---
we have needed a budget increase since release.
---
Thank you!
---
The way the Scorched holds the Bear Arm though, the hand is floating inside the Bear Arm, I saw it today lol
---
Minus the pregnancy crop dusting
---
Yes, would you be able to place one at my camp? That would be super awesome, but I can't get on right now because I have to do homework. I live in Pacific time zone, so I'll be available tomorrow starting at ~4:00 and all weekend if you are able to place one for me
---
A lot of people are saying it happens when you reload. Im unarmed so idk. If you unequip your armor and put it back on your DR should go back up.
---
Yeah, that’s fine.
---
There's gifts, small gifts and large gifts.
---
Do you have backpack from the pioneer quest, or the 1 you just buy a plan for
---
Everything needs certification, it's the only way Microsoft and Sony can make sure something horrible doesn't get through and end up messing with essential console features or at worst bricking consoles.  This is why a game like Warframe releases their PC versions first and get all the bugs ironed out with easily distributed hotfixes and then uses that stable build as the basis for their console releases, because once a console release is out if there's a worst case scenario and something breaks you're waiting for the hotfix to go through cert
---
You need the one from the pioneer quest for it to work
---
Nope and I have played most the day today [xb1]
---
u/flakker01
---
Awesome, thank you so much! Just message me when you're available tomorrow or the weekend and I'll get on
---
Np, my GT is xxXNEGANXxx.
---
This. It's a VATS beast. And you can loot some of your ammo back from the corpses.
---
They really need to say need normal back pack for this skin ive seen a few posts about the mix up in a few days.
---
Probably, but it's be funny if it just fixed chemist perk making two presents
---
It’s a numbers game.  If you farm legendaries, this is nothing new.  Everyone gets the same RNG.  Some people just work a little harder and smarter than others.  There’s already a half dozen guides online, but it’s up to the individual to put in the effort.
---
Yup got one in Watoga
---
Definitely unusual.  Interesting to find out what else is in their loot pool.
---
darn, it was one from the plan, is there a way to get my atoms back? :(
---
They drop from the mid tier wrapping paper too.
---
The camp budget is ridiculous and should be tripled. It needs to be able to accommodate all of the junk they put in the atom shop plus camp reward plans as well as in game plans. I am also over being told how many lights I can have in my camp...it's my camp..it's my budget..let me use it how I see fit!!
---
is there a mega thread for new event?
---
Play Nuclear Winter. You get the most out of time played vs XP gained
---
But that doesn’t go to adventure mode does it?
---
This is especially good if you hate nuclear winter and eventually want tier rewards.
---
It does actually. You gain XP for Nuclear Winter and for adventure mode
---
No , dont be sorry ,i totally get it and i relate to all you have mentioned .
---
I am extremely mad myself , and i wish more of us got vocal and louder about it!
---
I love the Nuclear Winter mode ! Well , besides the blatant hacker problem (which is out of hand for quite some time now) ,but other than that it really is well balanced and fun .
---
You mention the vault raids ... you are lucky for even being able to do them . They dont work for me since they launched , so yeah , nothing to do besides the NW.
---
By the way , i have seen you a lot before ! You are a very strong opponent :)
---
So , hopefuly i wont see you out there , unless we are both in the same team lol jist kidding :)
---
Nothing but coal and fertilizer. The vendor gift paper unlocked me a plasma grenade plan. I dunno how much time I spent farming for that thing since backpacks. Have a few santa crash plans, that's probably common and a few mounts from the vendor paper. Only killed 3 santas in the wild (small, medium, large gift). Excited I have the plasma grenade finally!
---
You sound like the ass hole here, tbh.
---
They'll usually give at least 1 refund but you could also wait until you get to pioneer scouts backpack so you can put it on that.
---
Yes, it does. ☺ You get XP for both NW, and Adventure. Not sure the exact % but it's a fair amount of both. Right now, the Halloween challenges are back. Good way to get some spooky paint sets too. 🎃
---
Do whatever suits you, either way your getting a bonus. My advice would be explore and enjoy the game, you only get one first play through.
---
If you really want to maximize i would work on quests and do events as they pop up. Also to even further maximize you could solo nuclear winter if you are taking a break to make food or shower etc. just choose solo in tab and afk and bush wookie for exp, rinse and repeat.
---
By all means feel free to fly down to Austin and singlehandedly fix 15 years of code over the weekend.  I won’t stop you.
---
I also really like the option to buy wrapping paper and craft your own. It's a good cap sink in a game that was desperate for one. Hopefully they keep something like this all year round.
---
Why has it taken 15 years? Why were problems not found and addressed earlier, years earlier, when the problems first appeared?
---
I opened 60-80 today. I got 4 or 5 lights and Santa’s, the only mount I’m missing is the queen claw, and I got two plasma grenade plans :)
---
Thank you. It's particularly useful if you're using the excavator and collecting junk. Once I'm encumbered I swap my jetpack with my excavator  torso and I'm unencumbered again. But you could use any pa combo that suits you.
---
Fuck Bethesda
---
Yeah, or yourself.
---
What was this then you think?
---
Name one online RPG where your "decisions" actually matter other than maybe choosing a fraction. There are other people in the world, so you can't pull an FO3 and bomb Megatron because that would impact the other players who might not have reached that point in the story yet. You can't give the platinum chip to Caesar and start a war because it would impact people who haven't hit that part of the story yet. 
---
Because of the other people, your choices can't carry the same weight as a single player RPG because they could affect others. Does that make 76 "bad" as an RPG? Maybe compared to the previous single player games, but compared to other online games I don't think so m

Maybe its bugged? If i dont get one in the next 4 hours, then ill store it away.
---
Gotcha, TIL.
---
Same. Did Collision course a few times. Hit some fissure sights. Cool surprise to get all the scrip too. 
---
Running melee, of course. 😉 😂
---
Even better.
---
You do realize many RPGs don't have actual choices that effect anything beyond themselves? For many games, RPG just means stats and level progression.
---
doubt i'll ever get it as those scout missions are just annoying to me
---
How did u get a private server?
---
If it doesnt say. Then u have enough time i think
---
You got 4 days my dude
---
Alright
---
Cause it would go to leaving soon section first i think
---
Thanks dude. Good to know.
---
They're not that hard. The only pain in the ass part is reviving someone in water which is easy if you post here and ask someone to sacrifice themselves.
---
Hell, I'll do it if you're on xbox.
---
You are only comparing to other Bethesda games, Ive recently played the Mass Effects, Which is why I might be so harsh on this game. In Mass Effect you choices matter greatly. Not just from 1st to 2nd but just in one of the three titles your choices matter. The Outer Worlds for a second. Star Wars KOTR. There are many other RPG's other than Bethesdas. Im not comparing 76 to other online RPG games, Im comparing it to games that share the name. Fallout, Which have been known to be a certain kind of game, this game tries but doesnt succeed in being that kind of game. I compare it to Rust or Dayz because in my opnion its closer to those games than it is any other fallout.
---
But if making a game online takes away some of the best aspects of the series, is it worth it to make an online game? One that is basiclly dead and if it had be single player would at least have a chance. Nothing about 76 makes it different from other games aside from its an RPG surival game, but i fail to see the rpg aspect.
---
Yea I’m an idiot! I thought they were like a once a day thing so I’ve been buying all the wrapping paper! If I knew they replenished when you server hopped I would of only got the large ones!!!
---
So it flipped?
---
They're fixing the armor bug tomorrow by reverting the 250dr bugfix. So the major issue will be fixed tomorrow at 8am.
---
Well it is bugestha that’s my nickname so what ever since launch it’s been buggy
---
Okay thats fair but the Fallouts are known for actual choices, and this is a fallout game.
---
They never were going to leave because of that. It only bugged the armor set I was wearing. The unyielding armor in my stash was all working fine. If that was the case for everyone then they all would have just had to farm new armor.
---
Try n pick it up n place it back down?
---
I did it once and found 1 satanscorch
---
Dude i sorta hate that event xD i kept seeing a flying scorch beast thats 1* at least 4 times.
---
You can get one of those payday loans, if you're American it's important that you stay in a state of perpetual debt.
---
I don't see a difference between a private server and a private world but that might just be ignorance. I was able to go into a world without anyone else there, loot anything I wanted without worry someone else took it, drop things and then come back to pick them up on another character, and also farm any legendary common spot without worrying about anyone stepping on my toes. Is there a specific explanation to your meaning?
---
Having this problem on PS4 as well. Even though we're both friends and on the same team
---
Oh, yes it's trashy. I like the fissure sites more, ultracite and actual legendary Scorchbeasts too. I am never able to agro the Scorchbeast that reacts to the sirens.
---
Again, those are all single player games. You can't have a huge impact on a game that has 20+ other people on the same server.
---
Yes, they took away some of the "personal choice" that would affect others, but that was out of necessity. How would you feel if you walked into the citadel and another Shepard had already altered the story, or if someone chose to sacrifice the Geth/Quarians and deprived you of that choice before you got to that point in the story, and when you get there they're already dead?
---
It can't be done. Multiplayer games have to leave all options open for anyone else who wanders into that area after you.
---
Ooh I have that bug as well. It happened shortly around patch 12 and is back again. It does give you rewards but visually doesnt show its completed.
---
I'd pay a dollar to see this.
---
May hit them up tomorrow.
---
It's also a multiplayer game. So it is already breaking the mould. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
Hmmm i take a beast down in 3 shots . 
---
You sure you were running single shot right? 
---
But agreed handmades are insane
---
I've only opened 2, sir.
---
Not really, I'm up to like 20 but I wanted to make the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory reference
---
I think it was my first gift from a 3star was just a cat mount
---
Having someone as team member is not same as friend. You need to send friend request and he has to accept it from social menu. If this isn't the case and he is on your friend list as accepted friend, then it's a bug and those are often resolved by restarting the game.
---
Also a new secret untracked quest not mentioned in the update notes. Starts at Grafton Pawn Shop!
---
It gets hard some days.
---
Junkies gives you 10% dmg per addiction up to 50% at the cost of reduced S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats. Not really a downside if you know what kinda addictions to get.
---
And this is Reddit, where the average user has An iq of 50- you communicate at the level of your audience tool. 
---
The real idiots are the ones like you who want to argue Symantec’s in order to obscure the fact that they’re talking out of their asses.
---
Yes you do get to keep them. Once the sub ends you won’t be able to access the private world
---
Saw a video on YouTube with a walkthrough and it brought me to search for this. Now I'm here to share the news. Someone would have to write it down step by step. 
---
https://youtu.be/LaiQmyRQKL4
---
Oof! I’m an idiot.. XB1
---
Me and gf played [LINE IN THE SAND] confirmed dropped SEVEN holiday scorched!! Highly recommended! 
---
P.S do not repair surface to air missile turret for it obliterated the first holiday scorched we found =.=
---
I heard you had to leave the game, add to team, then join. I think.
---
I got the extra claw plan
---
I tried looking for it, found a post saying it was upstairs in the building towards the east but i checked all buildings and nothing. Please let me know if you can find it for me?? And post exact location details
---
I’ve gotten a ton of plans of the crafted boxes just curious about dropped large boxes. I was thinking maybe they will have separate plans that drop from crafted and dropped ones. Not sure just wondering. Did that plan come from a large box?
---
Deathclaw eggnog = Deathclog
---
oh no came from a medium I got 1 large and got a mounted tick
---
I’ve gotten a few large gifts so far
---
Lol damn. Was it just a scorched that dropped the large one? Or do other legendaries drop the boxes as well?
---
Curious of how long it took you to get 20?
---
3 star santa scorched
---
Had three show up while defending workshop on private.
---
I've been interested myself....I got two short suits while a friend got a long and two short. But saw almost everyone during the event with long.
---
Where do you see Halloween challenges?
---
They both had the same drop rate, but because people liked the long pants suit more I'd say the short pants would be easier to get because people would be more willing to trade it
---
I just came across a short in a vender for 5k caps and I jumped on that big time but it’s the first time I’ve ever seen one
---
I have had decent luck at Lewis and Sons, just north of Camden .. Camden didn't look particularly useful since it is too wide, takes you longer. Also a shed in the woods at Lewis and Sons has 2 which spawn quite a few xmas scorch .. but it is hit and miss
---

Get high and crash some parties, this information brought to you by ~~Fallout Wiki~~ The Enclave, mayhem is our order.
---
It’s bad lol. Everytime you reload... and even sometimes it just won’t even work at all during SBQ fight I sat for 2 minutes just unequiping and re-equipping my armor to nothing.
---
I think I sold mine for 500....I never know or check   what the value really is economy wise. All I  want is to help people get what I have and what they want while getting a little extra caps. I have no idea personally what the market value of it is, sorry.
---
I have received 3 large but all in the Cranberry Bog at some of the farms and SB locations . For me any thing in the Forest or North was giving me small gifts.
---
When you load into a NW game check you ‘challenges’ and it will show you your progress.  On PS4 hit options&gt;L1&gt;Challeges
---
Oh nice!!! I’ll check that out for sure.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Makes it do more damage!
---
all plasma cores in inventory had like low charges and i got like 15 of them, that makes no sense
---
Wow man I want that hahahaha
---
That would be great!
---
I will help you if you're on PC.
---
Get this x2 gifts crafted before the update. Bet that is one of the things they change. Use chemist when crafting them at a tinker workbench.
---
It's not a quest. You just have to work it out yourself.
---
WHY ARE YOU YELLING!
---
I’m mad. Lol
---
It shoots little blue pills instead of pellets.
---
Why are you asking a question with out using “?” ? Hmmm?
---
Go play skyrim
---
Go to bed
---
Gender is a spectrum.
---
It only effects 3 star Unyielding armor, I went and vendor hopped buying up 2 star heavy bos Unyielding pieces and it does not effect 2 star.
---
Raider junk has come in waves through the atom shop. More BOS and Responder stuff is desperately needed.
---
Honestly worried about the prestige system after this whole armor debacle.
---
I was concerned about trying to find the holiday scorched with everyone else out hunting them but is has been pretty easy and conflict free so far.
---
I see them. I thought it was it’s own section. Cool. I’m enjoying NW. how do I equip these skins I’m unlocking?
---
Would any1 point me to where do I find it to build it in my CAMP, please? I have purchased it in Atom Shop. However I can't seem to find it in the build mode.
---
The fix Bethesda released for +250 Damage Resist when reloading cause a bug where when you reload your effects on some or all of your armor pieces to be disabled until you unequip then re-equip them. Crouching while reloading doesn't trigger the bug but then firing or swapping weapons will trigger the bug. Mostly affects Unyielding, Bolstering, Vanguards. I have all Unyielding and the bug affects my two Marine armor pieces, only other common thing they both have is Reduces damage while blocking by 15%
---
They were in the shop last year around Christmas. After seeing how good they look on the scorched, I regret not buying them.
---
The low ones are from reloading before you empty a core fully. So if you reload with 18 shots left, that core with 18 left goes into your inventory. When you run out of full cores, you start to use the non full cores. 
---
If you go make a core with ammosmith on youll see it over charged. Super duper simply gives you another full or overcharged one depending on if you have ammosmith on or not.
---
I think it's intended.  It's not a 'chance' to make 2, you just automatically get 2 if you have the perk.  
---
Yeah, I feel like I got pretty decent drops and it was super easy to find the santa scorched.  I stopped doing the fairgrounds and Clancey Manor(easily the best spot in the Forest) because I was getting level 1, 5, 20 legendary drops.  I got a level 20 Vampires pipe gun that I would have killed for at that level.  
---
To(mostly) make sure the legendary drops are max level, I went with NRA Research Center, Camp Venture, Valley Galleria.  Berkley Springs and Harpers Ferry could be worked in as well.  Ft. Defiance outside, south mountain lookout, big bend tunnel, maybe the Watoga buildings, but they were kind of tedious.  Good luck; we're all gonna be broke.
---
Damn those are good ones! Yea I just don’t think chemist would apply to gifts. Maybe super duper but it’s not a chem. Idk I hope it stays because I’m definitely going to be broke for a while lol
---
Yeah, Whitesprings is a great idea. I was hopping all over different train stations and was like "waaaait a minute...", can hit WS and the train station and hop up to Top o the world for those two vendors.
---
I was shocked to get plans for Grognak's earlier today.
---
If you do above 1k damage its supposed to give you junk
---
You dont need to do 1k damage but it works for all i know who have had that problem. Good luck
---
Mostly get small, some middle size, a few large.
---
I know it's only been going on for about 12 hours but so far this has been super fun. It has me wracking my brain trying to remember where scorched spawn heavily.
---
i never reloaded before empty
---
Quarter 1 of 2020 that’s all anyone knows. Which means January February or March
---
I just wished they stacked.  Super Duper would make more sense, but one or the other is fine with me I'm sure intended.  
---
I did get a max lvl 2 star bloodied power attack grog axe, so I'm glad I stuck to the higher level areas for the most part.
---
Yea I’m definitely switching to the east side of the map! I got a couple decent things but they are like level 15! But regardless it’s free scrip so I’m cool with that
---
Ah geeze, I have a nice copy paste message. Lemme dig and see if I can find it. It goes over every new addition
---
Ah , that's unfortunate then. Thanks for the info though. 🙂
---
Yesterday I had like maybe 10 3* scorched who wasnt even         ?santa?
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say Survival mode or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
lol it wasn't that hard because I post it in almost every "returning player" thread
---
Nice job!  Every time I try to build I get can't place needs support
---
As it happens, yes, people do post "I'm to lazy to look at patch notes and google information myself" threads way to fucking often, but you're the first I can remember who's literally typed out the google searches here instead of just \_doing your own research\_.
---
/lurk
---
I made the same mistake.
---
Santa's little helper :) thanks
---
all displays are useless, why would putting stuff in them take budget+ inventory [space.](https://space.do) do you play your own game, meanwhile sub to get unlimited scrap.
---
I want them to be some of the early modded in mannequins from 4. They had faces and the eyes would track movement. They were creepy as fuck and I loved them.
---
Well done
---
wait for 1-2 years for 1 item you wanted, because you missed 1 event, is ridiculous.
---
Just looked and read your questions. I'll go over them now.
---
1. Whitesprings has been nerfed three times but is still a good way to go about farming xp, but now the legendary spawns are in line with other areas
---
2. Nope, backpacks go away in PA.
---
3. They were nerfed heavily, but still the highest DPS secondary effect, however now faster fire rate is also highly prized due to a PvP nerf. On the flip side, energy weapons lost the explosive effect and because of this they did not receive the same nerf, so "legacy" explosive weapons are STILL just as powerful as they were so they are sought after
---
4. No change to core duration that I know of
---
5. Excavator is still pretty good
---
That's probably the first thing they fix tomorrow.
---
Oh hell yeah. Anytime I'm hiding in a bush I have it at max height and steadily rotating.
---
You loaded each core in to check the exact amount? Or is the value 18 for all of them?
---
Dont look up too much and get overwhelmed. Most fun thing imo is exploring when you dont know too much about the game. Most definitely stay away from this sub because ppl get very emotional here and overreact about a lot of stuff. Best not come in here until you're a bit higher level and hooked on the game
---
Nothing groundbreaking for older players, but my newbie-char (lvl 12 yesterday evening) got a nice medic hunting-rifle, Grognacs axe (that I can use at lvl 30), a few plans and some decent junk to scrap, especially a Giddy-Up Buttercup. Screws, yeah…
---
But I have to admit those legendary X-Mas Scorcheds scared the s**t out of me, and they were quite tough to fight…
---
The Christmas scorched look so cute. Just encountered a scorched leader dressed in blue snowflake jacket and dropped me a Hunters Explosive minigun. Thank you for this fun event Bethesda!
---
yes all 18 shots, so wtf! not value
---
Have you listened to The Storyteller's Krampus Hunt on Old World Radio?
---
The Krampus story starts at 45:30.
---
https://youtu.be/-ZtvDnNHm4k
---
I see bunny hopping through walls and shooting from distance of other side of map, very stupid, and ppl who do it are really handicapped
---
Super mutant behemoth grinch boss 3 star with a lot of health so people can actually tag it when it spawns and it doesn’t just die immediately
---
Stop thinking like me. I just turned my camp into a Zero G base like 2 days ago.  [https://imgur.com/a/YiSs04O](https://imgur.com/a/YiSs04O)
---
Any place that spawns scorched can have them
---
Spent fiveish hours server hopping and selling things to people so I could buy high quality wrapping paper to turn into gifts. Ended up learning all the mounted head plans, DCG extra claw mod plan, plasma grenade, and some PA pieces and dense mods!
---
Why are you here?
---
Needs dot sights, scope options and more damage really. Built in armor penetration would be good and make sense as well.
---
Yep. I do, anyways
---
lol do you shitpost like this on your main account too my guy?
---
You know it’s bad when you have to hope and pray for an update to make your game good lol
---
Well make new ones and youll see they will be normal size. Idk how you got that many low ones all the same but its not going to the normal capacity because you dont have any full cores.
---
Except a crossbow
---
You know your life is sad when you spend time posting negative things about a game you don't even play
---
Need a spare plan ?
---
Games bad. Next
---
k, how many alt accounts do you make for the purpose of this though?
---
Thats a lot, i wish i had so much luck.
---
69 game bad
---
Even if you don't think it'll be any good, it'll be free, so why not give it a try?
---
I don't get why people get mad that others enjoy this game, can you explain it to me? Are you upset that after a year it's still chugging along and receiving updates?
---
I've gotten a dozen or so. Just hit up locations with lots of Scorched.
---
Suddenly the strength of ten Grinchs plus two seems *much* more impressive.
---
Congrats! Still hunting, myself, but the event's still young.
---
Anywhere between January and April is my understanding.
---
I am sending you my RNG telepathically, you'll get it very soon!
---
The Queen isn't like most mobs; you can't just tag her and get loot. It's possible you didn't do enough damage to her to qualify for loot.
---
I've gotten two out of a dozen or so. Both from low-level Scorched, oddly.
---
Yeah, I played a few hours last night and everyone was pretty good at tagging them fairly (except one member of our team who didn't grasp the idea of "hit them softly so everyone gets a turn')
---
I just got a large gift from a Scorched at Monongah Power Plant from a level 1. Seems to be pure RNG.
---
You loose access to private worlds and can no longer place junk into your scrap box. Otherwise, yes, you keep all of your unlocks; a lot of people subbed for a month and instantly cancelled just to get the Ranger armor.
---
Haha, no.
---
See this is what I was wondering. Because I’ve spent the last hour in the higher level areas and have killed 1-3 stars and they all had small gifts on them. I’m going to make a map and make my rounds tomorrow!
---
Might wanna check associates
---
The door-&gt; wall trick is good. If you want an easy way to go from floor to floor or inside to roof though you need conduits.  End cap conduits come with both up and down connectors that go through floors/roofs. You can combine them to move power to another floor.
---
Yeah, the scrap box in 1'st says we're never getting more "free" storage. It's nice if you don't mind paying three times what the game's worth per year.
---
So they end up putting the mounted heads in the christmas event because they didn't do a properly random hunting permanent event rewarding those mounted heads?
---
I wanna see a Giddyup hobby horse staff, similar to the Sheepsquatch staff!
---
Or they were gonna be in other things and due to the Wastelanders delay they were like shit, we have to throw them a bone during the holiday event we have to cobble together.
---
A lot of people are doing the airdrop mission at Morgantown airport. I can confirm that sometimes one of them goes with you when you fast travel. Finished the quest and fast traveled to my tent by fort defiance and boom, Container fell out of the sky in front of me lol. Tends to happen to a lot of things, not just containers. Raining scorchbeasts seems pretty common too
---
It starts faint and gets louder so it really depends on your sound volume/Settings.  My volume is really low so I only hear it when I’m on the first floor and it’s on the second floor nearly above me.  However, with volume up I can start hearing it 2-3x’s further away it seems.  If you wander around it’s very useful...if you farm the same areas then eventually you’ll pick up on all the spawn locations and could drop using it.  I keep mine on just because it helps with efficiency because it means I might have to run up one less flight of stairs.
---
That’s good, because I want to pair the suit with  the antlers I’ve bought plus the full eye smudge but coloured blue.
---
Just found my first ever christmas scorched right now and it was a legendary. Just 15 sec ago.
---
Yes, I get 2 this night, and a friends one
---
Morgantown, all Fissure sites, Glass Caverns. Those are the 3 I ran for about an hr earlier and received 3 small and 1 large gift.
---
Of course there are more.
---
O definelity needed, personally its one thing i would actually use atoms on. Not a huge fan of most of the items that pass the shop. But give me the ability to use that or caps to smash out extra room similar to ESO with bag space then i am down like a clown charlie brown!.
---
I'm playing solo
---
So right now im hunting in the mire and its been a steady flow of large gifts by far.
---
Prime is a receiver that you can attach to weapons. Lmg = light machine gun. FFR = faster fire rate. In combination these are quite good. Also if you have rank 3 of fireproof and add a dense mod to your chest armour, the scorch beasts sonic attack won’t really hurt you.
---
One moment, you Can craft gifts?
---
Keep in mind, it seem that level doesn't affect your chances of a large gift dropping. As such, lower level areas like Morgantown, the Mothman Museum, and Camden Park are great.
---
&gt;i wish more of us got vocal and louder about it! 
---
The infuriating thing about this is that I've seen youtubers   actually hailing this as a great change! Their logic is that hey, the lobbies are small, so big maps with few players result in too much time where nothing happens. The smaller maps speed it up. 
---
That really misses the point. 
---
Why are the lobbies so small on PC?  Because no one wants to play it. Why is that? Because of the hackers maybe?
---
I have the same issue...
---
Regardless of whether I choose the 'Team Only' or the 'Friends' option, and all the party members being in my friends list, it kicks everybody out after a minute or so so saying that they are not friends with the world owner.
---
Most frustrating.
---
Might try tonight to remove them from the friends list and adding them again.
---
This happens to me with the messenger event... the robot just randomly becomes hostile sometimes ,without me shooting it .
---
What wiener said
---
My psn is tatatawn. I'm always looking to work with a group and getting the experience boost
---
Pair up with high level player and kill high level enemies. Scorched preferably during current event
---
Philanthropist is when you eat/drink fills your team's as well.
---
Yes. Doubt it would happen. But it’s possible :)
---
Top left of the map there are loads of locations close together. Not much good if you're farming legendary weapons / armour as they're all low level, but a good chance of a gift drop
---
These are either a guaranteed spawn or a chance of a spawn for scorched and they're all fairly close together
---
* Marigold Pavlilion
---
* Point Pleasant
---
* Tyler County Fairgrounds
---
* Groves Family Cabin
---
* The Crosshair
---
* Clancy Manor
---
* Cobbleton Farm
---
* Lady Janet's Soft Serve
---
* Twin Pine Cabins
---
Further over to the east you could also do Morgantown Trainyard and Morgantown Airport where you can do the Collision Course event which has spawned 2 legendary scorched every time
---
Def Flatwoods. Lots of food, water, a vendor bot, resource benches, a replayable event, lots of wood to build your first shack, and a couple secrets.
---

I guess I can't use guns around my camp for now

Ok, so I just have garbage weapons and I suck.  Got it! :)
---
Stupid question but one of the survival guide entries says something about loading more than one arrow but there doesn’t seem to be any possible way to do this? 
---
Am I missing something?
---
Explosive tips
---
Yeap . Exactly . They should really comcentrate on solving the hacker problem ,rather than squeezing the few of us that are still left into smaller maps where the hacker problem actually makes everything even more difficult .
---
Yes , i have seen youtuber's praising this moronic decision and i am at a loss for word's . Clearly ,they are not playing NW like some of us , from day 1 , every day , so they can't possibly comprehend what a mistake this new change is.
---
Too much time where nothing happens they say? That is just bullshit . This is the time when we are able to strategize , collect much needed loot , plan ahead .This is what battle royale should be and not some stupid pointless death match that it has now become in the smaller maps .
---
I totally agree with you , but what can we do ?
---
😏
---
Yes this was exactly what was happening .
---
There's been at least one in about 75% of the guaranteed scorched spawn locations I've visited today. Sounds like you're looking in the wrong places.
---
Growing up in that bunker. Overseer bought it upon herself
---
Don't you have anything better to do, besides continuing your year long crybaby fest?
---
After an entire day of testing with my team of friends:
---
Fighting scorchbeasts. They usually spawn at least 1 "holiday" scorched.
---
Big Bend Tunnel (My favorite. This place is LOADED with Scorched)
---
The Collision Course event and airport/terminal Scorched (Second Favorite)
---
It's A Trap event
---
Glassed Cavern (fourth favorite)
---
The Palace of the Winding Path
---
Surface to Air event
---
Line in the Sand event (Third Favorite)
---
Valley Galleria (Tied with Big Bend Tunnel. Awesome.)
---
Scorched Horde events
---
The scorched that spawn at Arktos pharma and nearby Gauly Mine
---
Queen fights (Ignore the Queen, farm the mobs.)
---
Dropped Connection when the enemy is the Scorched
---
Enjoy! We absolutely cleaned house with presents today! :)
---
I think it's just an option, you should be able to have it like it was before. 
---
Not used it myself though.
---
Holy shit.
---
Hot fix today 8am et, hope they sort everything out!
---
There wasnt any in the data mine that ive been using as a checklist but neither were a few things ive gotten so maybe.
---
If you have the yearly plan the atoms for all 12 months should be delivered together on the day you make the yearly payment right ?
---
if anyone knows why this is please tell me, but why do energy weapons do less damage than ballistic still, even with them fixing the armor pen thing I have a Gatling plasma that does 234 damage and a 50. cal that does 194 damage on a super mutant max level the Gatling plasma dose 120 damage and the 50. cal does 130 and the super mutant has less energy resistance than he dose ballistic armor he has 80 energy and 130 armor. This makes NO sense at all and on a scorched the plasma does 116 and the 50. cal dose 160. this is just nonsensical they benefit from all the same perks and the 50 cal. does less damage but still dose more damage per shot.

To be fair, you could be someone who gained acces to the account unlawfully. To make sure this isnt the case they are asking for prove of purchase or other forms of ID. TO make sure it is indeed YOUR account.
---
What are the guaranteed spawn locations? I visited a number of fissure sites when I last played about 12 hours ago and although I was up against a lot of scorched, not one was a santa scorched. Cheers :-)
---
Raining flying creatures is an old Skyrim bug :)
---
Yup, murdered me XD
---
Yeah, I have encountered those aswell, but that doesn't brother me as it is purely cosmetic to me.
---
Well, they said they are going to start sharing more at the start of the new year, so I think we will have at least a few weeks of previews. So I will say late January at the earliest. 
---
There are also a ton of big games coming out early next year, the biggest starting with the Final Fantasy VII remake on March 3rd, so ideally Wastelanders will be out before then. 
---
So... I'm going to say February.
---
Shame the loot is useless!
---
I'm personally mindful of the following: bloodbug proboscis, bloatfly gland, stingwing barb, tick blood sac, digested goo. I've also recently learned the new Fallout 1st Scrapbox can be even more brutal, so I try to put all these in the Stash before I do any other scrapping and storing.
---
Must..... Refrain... from... making.. pun.. about... tick-sized.. privates.....
---
Must.. resist....
---
Well because... It just works!
---
It's getting fixed tomorrow
---
You’re not missing out on anything. I’ve just been getting regular plans, and lots of repeats.
---
On the flip side OP, explosive legacies, (plasma, laser, radium, Gauss, and Dragons) all benefit from the pre-nerf damage on Explosive so are incredibly overpowered. If they buffed energies in addition to this fact I'm kinda scared how quickly things would go down
---
I forgot to mention that I have amassed an embarrassing amount of .38, 10mm, .45, and 12 gauge.    I have no problem supplying the ammo.
---
Do you use Ricochet? I've aggro'd them from simply being near their firefight without actually shooting at them.
---
Buy 3 from me for 303 caps :D jkjk the plan is a reward from project paradice.
---
*Hol up*
---
Nope, I think it could be reminence from the Halloween event when they got mad at you for destroying things because they aggrod on me after killing a super mutant who was attacking them, non of my bullets hit them, but theirs hit me
---
So nice to get the plasma grenade plan
---
I started to notice a difference in hunger and thirst about three months ago. It honestly seems to get worse every patch.
---
We have a cap so people dont end up trading simple things for thousands of caps or good legendaries for 9999999999999999. No thankyou.
---
Back in the day they'd aggro if you blew up cars or trampled the flowers but I thought they removed that. Were you standing on Mr. Gardener's prized roses? LOL
---
You can buy wrapping paper at any general merchant (i.e. BOS, Graham, Raider, Responder, etc.) start at the white springs mall, then work your way around the map. Don't forget to sell mutations or such once the vendors get near 1400 caps so you can keep going!
---
🤡🐑🤡🐑🤡🐑🤡🤡🐑🤡🐑🤡🐑🐑🤡🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🤡🤡🐑🤡🐑🤡🐑🤡🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
---
Nope my camp is past the golf club near the watchtower
---
I avoided it like the plauge ubtil the santa scortched showed up.
---
Yes you’re Dominga something wrong. You’ll find legendary scorecards (Christmas scorecards) at almost every fissure site. Relog and do it again, over and over.
---
*All misspellings were on purpose in an attempt to tease op’s own mistakes.
---
Depends on what your shooting.
---
I never thought the budget would really be an issue for me, but now I see why it's requested so much. I'm basically full and all I have is a house with three rooms. It's thoroughly decorated, but still.
---
Thankyou
---
That's I meant to say. Also they've been in the game since the Tadpoole quests.
---
What is gift wrap used for ? Can you craft presents if so what components does it take ?
---
Haha...you’re right.  That’s what I get for trying to use my memory...I suffer from CRS! 😂
---
Also Bing Bend Tunnel, have gotten at least three presents each time I’ve run through.
---
Even if they just renamed the santa scorcheds...
---
how so? the super mutant has 50 less energy resistance and the plasma dose 40 damage more so by all rights the plasma should do more damage. And this is an enemy where energy should be stronger than ballistic I did it on multiple mutants and all in the chest and always the same.
---
I absolutely hate that event its hard to find a group that can actually handle getting to the end
---
Go play TESO
---
Mr Sandman
---
Yeah, last ones opened had one. The plasma grenade earlier too.
---
20k caps later, it's worth.
---
Curious on these plans value after the event ends
---
THIS is the type of answer I was looking for. Thanks.
---
That a true PSA.
---
No shit.
---
Mine too! XDDDD
---
Mister sandman adds .50. What is giving the other .75?
---
Events can also spawn these - got two during Collision course.
---
Man, we all get it - you don't like the game. You've post hundreds of posts about how much you don't like it, day in day in - at this stage I'd just go find something to play that you do like, as this is kind of obsessive now.
---
This, if you grind 25 or so high quality gifts you will get it for sure
---
Got mine for free off a nice guy just before this started. Lots of rare plans are gonna plummet in value. 
---
Markets gonna get flooded.
---
Did you give it a try?
---
In the Savage Divide most of the raider outposts are scorched almost all the time, like the one by Westtek and a couple of the clifftop bases if you're looking for higher leveled enemies. The event at Fort Defiance, Line in the Sand I think, is also a great source. If you are just after the plans and dont care about the levels: Camden Park, Tyler County Fairgrounds, Point Pleasant, Wavy Willards, the Morgantown Airport for Collision Course and the interior, as well as the train yard right there, Hemlock Holes, Gauley Mine, Greg's Mine Supply, Helvetia and Sutton. Those last ones are all close to Vault 76 and it's a pretty quick route, the last couple of times I ran it tonight I had gathered about 20/25 presents total.
---
I got mine for free off a person - honestly, this event is just going to crash most plan prices, especially sought after ones. Great for the majority of the playerbase!
---
That can be arranged mate, what time zone are you in?
---
Mister sandman adds 50%.
---
2.50÷ 2= 1.25
---
2.50 + 1.25 = 3.75
---
OP may he onto something. Watoga robots attacked me for no reason today.
---
Nice, I always wondered if that made it to the game and weirdly it did lol
---
You finished that quest in watoga to stop them from doing that right
---
Yeah of course. It's not my first time in Watoga, lol.
---
Why? I haven't had eny problem with it. Like mobs spawning inside the turret.
---
Ok. I was thinking it went off raw score like covert operative does. Thanks
---
When I was level 1-25, higher level players would sometimes drop bags with some random ammo, food, chems etc, I guess just stuff they didn’t have capacity for. I didn’t have any experience with online games, so I was prepared for the worst, player wise. It was such a pleasant surprise. Now that I’m higher level, I see that stuff as way less valuable, but now I try to do the same for low leveled players. This community has some really decent people in it!
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376149/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-december-13-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
Maybe the damage-vs-resistance formula is different for energy damage? That or it's a bug (new or existing). You're right - higher damage per shot should result in higher post-resistance damage.
---
Then you may be right, I may be onto something
---
Thanks hopefully they fix it
---
I know some people don't like the combination of the Sonic device and SB Screams
---
Looking so hard for those icicle lights lol
---
TL,DR on the bottom.
---
So to sum things up: If you really have to do each challenge separately, the total amount of xp needed is 40001 XP. That number does seem a little high, though. Since the claim of challenges not stacking up has neither been confirmed nor denied (I can't test it myself right now) that is the value I am going with.
---
Let's say by some miracle, you win every match and average 900 XP. You would need \~45 Matches to complete the entire challenge. 
---
Let's also say those matches will each last around 25 Minutes (Bushwookies notwithstanding). You would play for a total of around \~19 Hours. That is just ingame time, not waiting in Main Menu/Lobby for the match to start.
---
That already sounds like a pretty insane grind. Just for the funsies let's take a look at what happens if you are less than the best thing since sliced bread and don't win every single match in 25 Minutes or less.
---
Imagination can stretch, of course, but I'd say you can average 400 XP if you are playing Bushwookie on Flatwoods not picking up any guns and only hiding for as long as you can. 
---
With the imaginary average of 400 XP per match you would need around 100 matches to reach 40001 XP.
---
Now, that does sound like alot, but the matches will be shorter if you do not reach the top spot. Let's say 15 Minutes as an average. The grind would be 25 hours long.
---
Considering the fact that the Halloween challenges took me \~3 days to finish at 14000 XP I can only imagine how insane it is going to be with 40001 XP. We can only wait and see what the 16th will bring. 
---
\--------------
---
TL;DR: Did the math with extreme and average numbers. 19 hours to grind if you're hot shit, 25 hours if you're average rando(like me). Pure ingame time, not waiting in line for matches to start! Real life time will be longer.
---
Gonna print a shirt: I killed the Flatwoods Monster and all I got was 4 caps, aluminium, glas,  acid and this t-shirt.
---
true it could be different or could just be a bug but I am pretty sure it does this for all energy weapons that use only energy damage. Don't get me wrong the plasma rifle is awesome now and the Gatling plasma may do a bit less damage due to the bug or the way resistance works or whatever it is but it is still good. But laser rifles omg the most useless guns in the game, the damage is so low compared to other ballistic guns and that is with them saying the laser rifle is at the same damage as or even more than the other. Kinda sad laser is my favorite in fallout and the ONLY way you can use a Gatling laser is with bloodied, adrenal, bloody mess, all heavy weapon perks, and ultracite, and prime, and all that makes it an alright heavy weapon. Weird though at least when it was the armor pen thing we knew why they did so much less now I have no idea makes no sense on paper it is better but dose less XD
---
They’re binging server down for maintenance tomorrow at 8:00 am EST supposedly to fix it. From what I hear they at w just gonna reverse the patch like it never happened because it’s such a big issue, until they figure out a proper solution.
---
Massive amounts of currency, think Plasma grenade plan value
---
Yup. Think I only need 4 more (not including the sb and sbq)
---
That was achieved with a B40 +1STR Meathook, which benefits from both unarmed and 1 Handed perks, Full set of +1STR Uny armour, revenant perk, adrenal max'd out, unarmed bobble head, US OP's magazine number 8, Whiskey (with Party boy is +6 STR), Fury,  Deathclaw, Sheepsquatch, mutant Hound, glowing meat and Yau Gui food all washed down with a Nukashine.   
---
Its a queen killing build, with zero QOL perks, honestly 99.9% of the time its an awful build, but you can do this - 
---

---
Prices for the paper seem rather steep considering the rewards really aren't that crazy. If there wasn't a daily limit on vendor caps, I wouldn't mind nearly as much.
---
It's too bad the enemies don't occasionally drop wrapping paper. That would have been a decent alternative for crafting extra gifts.
---
While I'm enjoying the event, I wish they would have added more themed items. It seems there are only two of them? The Halloween event had quite a bit more.
---
So an update on the disappearing completed event screen.  I noticed today that when I completed, the event on the right hand visual menu tracking screen would blink real fast for a few seconds and then disappear resulting in zero rewards.  That happened 3 out of 4 times.  Thanks for reporting!
---
First ive heard of the Santa’s. Not everyone knows about it I guess.
---
It's in the news section when you log in, dunno how people have missed the talk about them lol
---
A fix is needed so bad. If they do t want to Icreas it much then;
---
Make turrets have their own budget or just keep the cap 10 but they dont add to bidget.
---
Items in displays should have their own seperat budget.
---
These two things would dramatically help. But yea we need either a budget increase or certain things need to cost waaayyy less
---
Also maybe a set max for crops as well. Would need to be reasonable for farmers but keep people from making lag farms.
---
I just pulled a Bffr Ultracite gattling laser and I love it. Ive got Bffr on mini, gattling, LMG, and 50 cal. And the ult gattling laser is my favourite out of them all. Damn thing holds 1k rounds. And it's like a delete button on scorched beasts. PLUSE it shoots red lasers
---
Heck I've been using on the sbq more often then my be plasma. It's easier to keep on target and I don't kill myself when someone walks in front of me
---
Received 2 Large gifts, both from high level bad guys
---
I definitely missed it. I don’t read the news. I just log in and play.
---
I'll have to check that out. Just been hoping at the whitespring
---
I've done this before, it's a good trick to know.
---
Pretty much. Y’all just hide in bushes anyway.
---
One at Grafton Dam, Posiden Energy plant has a couple, and one at Garrahan Estate. Pretty sure the other power plants have them as well.
---
This is the first Reddit post you saw about it too though? Weird, people have been talking about it for days, but this was the first day it was live. Legendary scorched spawn with presents and they can contain rare plans (plasma grenade, dense mods, power armor plans) while also having previously unobtainable plans (Grognak Axe, mounted animal heads) and adding new plans (snowflake lights, crashed santa)
---
Is this in 4 hours?
---
I haven’t been on Reddit all day. Just checking the feed now. I don’t keep my phone glued to my face lol. But thanks for the insight.
---
Just do the rounds of locations where you tend to see lots of scorched. Morgantown airport, Valley Galleria, Wavy Willard's, etc. You'll see a few of these festive freaks spawn alongside their more mundane counterparts.
---
you can use it to craft gifts at a chemistry station under aid, use chemist and you get 2 presents
---
Don't forget to "buy" it in the Atom store for the low, low price of zero atoms.
---
Advance Power Connectors is the Plan youre looking for
---
Kinda surprised there isn’t a candy cane skin for the walking cane; it seems so obvious lol.
---
Forget about a stash increase from now on, it will never happen... Maybe a decrease in order to force players to quit or into FO1st
---
Yeah I was giving you a rundown because I thought you would need a catch up. No problem my guy
---
Right now I'm running around in Excavator armor with a Bloody Minigun I found, erasing lvl80 Scorchbeasts in 2 seconds. I can wait ti get back to beating to death Deathclaws with my legendary Bloody Walking Cane as a proper British gentleman.
---
Oh son of a...really? Wow. I wish I knew that earlier. 10k caps later :/
---
I’m catching up now lol
---
English
---
"People of the Commonwealth,  we come in peace"
---
Have you even played Fallout 4?
---
here's a guide  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChqFGX3MBx0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChqFGX3MBx0)
---
That's not even what the Prydwen looks like. I'd say someone modded the files and did some shit.
---
yep I use my Ultracite Gatling laser too use it all the time, but still I would like to see it do the damage it shows on the pip boy even with damage resistance factored in. I just tested it out on super mutants a bit ago I have a bloodied mini gun and than my bloodied ult Gatling laser with 10% more dmg when you aim, the mini gun is 109 dmg and the Gatling laser is 120 dmg and gets 10% more when aiming and super mutants have 80 energy resist ans 130 armor so based on the stats no duh the Gatling laser does more damage. NOPE the mini gun was doing 10 more damage per shot, it is not bad I still use it all the time and it is one of my favorite weapons but it is prime and has a 10% more damage and has less armor to go though and has more base damage but does less per shot. Same thing with the laser rifle too a handmade with the the same damage as my laser rifle will do 20 damage more per shot on a mutant how?
---
Kids of today.  In my day we made gift paper last for at least 5 Christmases....
---
I started a new character, and thought it was just the new char.
---
This 100%. I just had a match where 3/4 of the beginning circle was grafton lake and the surrounding wilderness... didnt find anything other then a switchblade the whole match. If theyre going to shrink the ring, they need to make the loot boxes more dense so you can at least some what gear up.
---
Make it a voting option if you like I like time to get supplies before I die in one or two shots
---
Depends on the armor type, but if it's combat armor, the watoga station vendor very rarely has it. I've gotten it for leather there as well. As people have reported, it can be in a gift box. There are also people in the market sub (not me) who will put it on your armor for caps. I've seen prices from 300 to 500. I had a guy put it on mine as part of a weapons trade.
---
Thats the Prydwen, just google it, its one to one the same.
---
Perspective is way off
---
I got a bunch of different mounted heads, "Santa crash" plans and an icicle light plan.
---
The color is wrong.
---
More camp room would be nice
---
That's what's funny is it looks older as in more rusty than it did in F4 that is years later.
---
This. It would have been a nice addition though. Just make them super rare.
---
Yes, this was a joke.
---
I'd LOVE a budget increase. On the other hand I'd also love to have more players on the map. And to be honest I don't know what I want more. Basically, if Bethesda finds out that they can safely double the budget, that also means that they can safely double to player count instead. I'm aware that's an oversimplification - a player on the server has more overhead than just his settlement budget - but the point is still valid: Any increase of settlement budget delays any plans to increase the player count. And vice verse. 
---
But if you're like me and want any one of the two options, then any change would be great. I have the feeling that I haven't seen any reports of server crashes or instabilities due to CAMPs and their budgets. So I'd guess there's a room for increase...
---
Very cool glad it can be farmed, is there a list of what you can get?
---
Probably gonna delete my character when i prestige
---
Hey that's my camp! Was a bitch to build it.
---
Lmao they should just reward a bush for bush campers
---
That's not the actual line. The actual line is "People of the Commonwealth, do not interfere. Our intentions are peaceful. We are the Brotherhood of Steel!"
---
I want the alien head is that an option?
---
I haven't played the game in 2 years 😑
---
Very welcome info
---
I have never been able to solo that one, if you are ps4 I am able to try to help
---
With the teases they’re putting in I’d say probably around January/February
---
If you're talking about the bad picture I agree. Like how do you see something that outlandish and not take a proper screenshot. No wonder we still dont have a non blurry photo of bigfoot in 2019.
---
Got it, in fact I have unlocked all mounted heads and yet still don't have the plasma grenade plans...
---
about 3 hours from now yeah
---
Nope not yet. Was onlöine for about 4 hours yesterday.
---
The hero I need, but not deserve. Unfortunately I'm on PC.
---
SHHHH!! keep your mouth shut! Why you blabbing to others one of the great ways to farm legendary scorched?
---
That's a neat idea. Hopefully it'd be bigger than that twig :D
---
Yeah. The Sonic generators are pretty annoying to listen to for minutes on end.   Scorchbeasts can spawn legendary now but for the longest time they were just a waste of ammo that rarely dropped anything close to useful.  Those 2 things combined made me stop going unless there was already a few people there to split the ammo waste with.
---
Pretty sure you will have plenty of company until the Xmas thing ends though!!
---
Hi dad.
---
All the more reason to rob your neighbors.
---
Stimulus engage!!
---
a 3 star explosive shotgun, why does it have to be 3 star, what other mods are you looking for
---
Thank you for telling us this. So it work similar to one violent night?
---
The fact that it’s clipping through the electrical tower makes me believe it’s legit. If this was done by a modder it would be more professional
---
Its in front of a tower the ship is to small and if it was there we would not be able to see that angle of the ship
---
Yep
---
Do you think this will affect map prices?
---
Some dmg resistance and health reg perks. Lvl 50.
---
How do you farm for the wraps?
---
And you need it for one of the scout challenges.
---
I haven't logged in since patch so I started playing FO4 sv mode. So refreshing :D
---
All the stealth multipliers and legendary effects / mutations are multiplicative. Only thing that isn't is crit dmg.
---
..wut?
---
I think you need to read this
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
It's to roll back the +250DR "fix".
---
But you're right, maybe they'll fix the chemist/gifts things.  Of course, if they do, who on earth knows what the secondary effects of *that* will be.
---
This is also a good time if you missed out on the Halloween rewards or were close it's back for the weekend
---
&gt; I don’t keep my phone glued to my face lol.
---
Caveman.
---
:)
---
My melee build is pleased. I can wipe entire teams with a board or a switchblade lol. But I agree that it makes other builds mostly non-viable.
---
Junk but coal is useful
---
All horde events do.
---
But with santascorched this one is the best.
---
Yeah without a guide it's confusing
---
I've noticed with the Collectron if you leave it and let it get full it starts to pull better junk towards the end(usually end up with 2-3 coal and 5+circuits and screws if I wait till 10/10). Maybe wait and let the Santatron fill up to max weight?
---
It isn't the destination, it's the journey.
---
For me personally, you are right. For the entire pool of gamers, I think not. Not everybody is a smart consumer. I'm sure they market the atom shop so that it generates the max amount of income
---
I would rather just have the old ones functioning...
---
I have ate an omelette now I know why I went back to normal
---
I don't think so. The event is 3 weeks long. You'd have to wait 3 or 4 months or even longer for it to be any value.
---
Instancing leak?  Maybe some other player was juggling grenades?
---
Haha your right. I just got on and see they are taking it down for maintenance in a few hours. Get it while you can
---
Yup
---
Looks like they are taking the game down for “maintenance” in a few hours. Says 8am usually it 10 am so they are in a hurry lol
---
Maps just changed now is a good time to learn
---
Awww that's so sweet!
---
After the event the plasma grenade plan will go right back to what is has been. Unless they add these in again with Wastelanders, they'll go for easy trades. But you're right, they're not required for anything like the Plasma plan is, so maybe just that one will stay at its current value
---
Bazaar got shut down because the mods were scamming and then banning people lol
---
OR A PLACE TO SHOW OFF MY GIRL GIDDYUP BUTTERCUP!
---
A VE +50 damage resist while aiming would fit what he asked for
---
I'm assuming that title is supposed to finish with "On Pipe Revolvers and Bolt Action Pipe weapons"
---
Otherwise, they never did
---
Yes. definitely. Normally I collect more water than I can drink, now it's less. If this stay like this, I'll have to farm for water at a certain point. Really don't want to do that.
---
Even then, they still do lol

They either missed out on a lot of cool things they could have done or were bogged down with bug fixing. Maybe next year when the game is a bit more stable, we'll have a more interesting Christmas event.
---
3 gorilla heads so far
---
Thanks, I'll have a hunt around there.
---
Thanks. :)
---
Haven’t seen these in any of the loot tables for the event
---
My camp is in a pretty safe area if the map and in an enclosed area, so hopefully it will be fine.
---
For low population matches they should just half the timer speeds. That way it pushes people together faster while still allowing people to gear up.
---
There’s an option at the bottom of the screen when picking which game type you want to join
---
I meant server hopping and shopping at the vendors but aparenlty you can just close the trade and open again to get more
---
I was actually talking about handmades
---
Just modded by zealots pipe pistol to a pipe rifle, same damage with two cards. Turn it back to a pistol, same damage with two cards
---
Is this a big website? Am i supposed to know it?!
---
the semi/full auto has never stacked, it was only the bolt and revolver
---
I've had perfect luck with both ends of the big bend tunnel with getting package givers(inside less so)
---
I love how creative people in this community are &lt;3
---
Good stuff!
---
Was the bolt. Used to work. Doesn't now unfortunately :(
---
Yes. Or while reloading. But aiming is better :)
---
yup but not lvl 50, they cap at 40.
---
 In 320 levels i did never see a lvl 50 mole miner, except in Nuclear Winter maby.
---
I've been trying to find any creature for a pet for the past 4 months but cant tame anything with both perks fully leveled up. Where exactly are these random spawm areas?
---
Multiple duplicate camp plans, some I didnt have, bunch of mounted stuff, every santa scotched i killed gave a stared weapen ranging from 1 to 3* but not all gave a gift. Seems like I ran in to quite a few of them. Still havnt gotten a gift from my santatron though
---
If you dont mind me asking because ive seen it in our private server vender how much are the wraps going for people paying high caps for them?
---
The high quality is about 1500 caps
---
I doubt it, I’ll still be buying maps at the same price
---
It’s just a big tree. That’s all. I put on top of my tent
---
I dont care about degrees of awful. Both Bethesda and CIG are shit. That's enough for me.
---
I just changed my regular scrap guy to farm for the xmas gifts instead.
---
I think I may have to store and re-update him to the Santa version then for these lines :)
---
Ahh jw is all thanks man or chick!
---
I have been having some issues regarding weight shown vs real weight in both character and stash. I thought wr armor (ammo, food and chems, weapons) was being affected, but my stash is in incoherent as well. Like, I am at 800/800, lots of junk are sold from my Machines and when I get there to restock, it still reads 800/800. 
---
Something is wrong, definitely.
---
Anustart
---
I got the grenade already! Dont worry youll get it,we have all month. I opened about 100 so far so id say its way easier than battle bot.
---
The event is actually only 2 weeks but I got a lot just on the 1st day so right now I'm confident it'll eventually drop.
---
Ever play mothership Zeta?
---
You can't simply slay those things, and display its remains as a trophy.
---
I got it.  The plasma grenade plan still eludes me although my friend sent me a pic of him getting in his first gift 😐
---
I think you will most likely be given someone elses account, in some sort of bugged lottery?
---
Wait, so that isn't a giant plateau conveniently in the shape of a West Virginia tourist sign?
---
Map makers and their doodles.
---
No. Switching it to a new fav slot seems to fix it
---
Nope, switching it to another fav slot seems to fix it
---
So far the best things I got are the Deathclaw and Mothman mounts, also got a tomahawk plan. Weird thing is I got both my first run through Big Bend but haven’t gotten another high quality present since, just regular and smalls.
---
Yeah, I deleted about 80 people, however started with 110. It helped a little, but still having some lag. I may try and just do a clean up on my drive. 
---
Thanks for your input man.
---
From what I've experienced pretty much anywhere with scorched has had a good chance of 1 minimum. I did line in the Sand and ended up with 5.  Only downside to going somewhere like Morgantown is that since they are legendary enemies you end up with low level drops.  If you are just after the scrip it's cool, but if you want a chance at a usable drop stick to higher level farming spots.  Fissures in the bog seem to work quite well.
---
I’m on PS4, but I’ve noticed that since patch 16 my game is stuttering and dropping frames way more than it ever has. Private worlds are a bit better but still occasional stuttering when a lot of enemies are screen.
---
Yea the majority of mine are small but even those sometimes have plans so that's cool. Jealous you got the Mothman Mount, that's rad!
---
Have they showed how the winter jacket looks like?
---
Double barrel can be useless against hordes. If you are hit during reloads (which is obviously going to happen unless you marsupial) you stop reloading. You can't keep firing.
---
So, it sucks. Good only for crippling.
---
My best completely noob and uneducated guess would think it will be something like ESO's Champion Points.
---
What is the current rate?
---
Luck and intelligence and no higher tiers do not make it easier.
---
Lost mine as well.
---
Of course. Bloodied unyielding is God mode. You get 75 extra special points, which means you become the strongest, most perceptive, lucky, intelligent and charismatic chimp in the wasteland. 
---
I have only one bloodied character, and he is a beast. But I enjoy other builds better. The party boy + alcoholic gunslinger is a blast, so is the army private.
---
I got the T-51b legs and raider helm.
---
Cannot build it, takes a shitload of build credits to build 🤔 .. got 20/30% left and still cannot build it
---
It is extended to 31st :)
---
100% agreed .... couple of tips : give us a charimsa perk wich enable pvp no matter what .... and a perceeption one with enable vats no matter what
---
That’s been there for a long time. You can find so much cool stuff just by wandering around!
---
No, just intelligence. Level doesn't matter at all.  Even if you are not a bloody build I recommend picking up the cheapest pieces of unyielding armor you can so you can get the extra intelligence bonus from that. Also using intelligence bobblehead, one of the mentats has a plus five intelligence to it.  Then make sure you have the Scrapper perk so you can get a lot of your materials back. There is also both a magazine that makes it cheaper to craft things and magazine that increases the yield when scrapping. Between the two you'll use half the materials.
---
This has to be the shittiest reward I've ever heard of.
---
Oh really? Dang, I thought they were dropping new stuff like they did for Sheepsquatch
---
I’ll be honest I don’t even think I have a single gun type or Armor that I have all the mods for. There are quite a few with 1 missing for guns and most of the armors are missing 5 or more.
---
I didnt play the holiday event, what was it like
---
Deathclaw head is really good, imo.
---
On ps4  yes. Reloading but also switching weapons
---
Low level is all you need.
---
Didn't even see him lol was quite dissapointed the show was pretty dead, I had a suspicion that there wouldn't be 76 there bc they didn't mention the awards in yesterday's ITV
---
On the right pre war Santa on the left ...
---
Have you checked the the box on the side for the stuff he collects?
---
He doesn't actually hand you gifts but you collect it like any other harvester
---
If you’re on PS4, I could help you there.
---
McGuyver agrees ..
---
Only new stuff is everything connected to grafton pawn shop from my understanding.
---
Just wait till the ash corpses start moving on you while you are at camp lol I swear devs were screwing with people. Like the weeping angels from dr who
---
So far I got the Santa crash, icicles, pretty sure every Mount, plus keep plasma grenade and lead pipe.
---
Majority were from buying high-quality wrapping paper and making the gifts at a bench (using chemist to double yield).
---
Having never really played ESO (only reading a break down of the constellation system) please elaborate.
---
I bought first for this same reason. Figured I'd grind for a month and fill the scrap box then when I run out of scrap I'll resub and fill it back up.
---
Oh I didnt know that, That's awesome!
---
Yes, very unique .. such as the pickaxe shaped sickle ..
---
Tried that matey. Still nothing, collecting toys etc as would expect but patch notes says occasional holiday gift, 12 hours of play straight play should give atleast one imo
---
Gift? He just collects stuff for you.
---
You can collect it by going to his pod and there should be a box on the back with a Santa face.
---
because damage penetrates armor easier the higher the damage
---
the damage on the gatling plasma is divided into two seperate damagetypes so each of them doesnt penetrate armor quite as well as one single damage from the 50cal
---
sorry im not entirely sure how the calculations work but i feel that thats the reason
---
Ah now that I think about it I haven't gotten a gift either.
---
Yeah I understand that and it’s collecting junk and toys etc but not the occasional holiday gift the patch notes says
---
Pre-accessing unreleased content
---
That wrapping papers pretty high priced. Even with the perk card &amp; graph mentats it's still about what 900 caps? I mean I'm not saying it might not be worth it, clearly you can get some good stuff.
---
I might put a ticket in and see what they say, started at 8pm last night till 3am then afk for 6 hours for vendors to sell, junk box full of toys but no gifts
---
Ohh I was unaware of the gift. I thought it was only scorched that dropped them
---
Like I said, its just a guess but based upon everything else they've ever over hyped, I'm assuming it's going to be something so minor we will all be disappointed. One thing Bethesda does is advertise well. Time after time we trust they're about to do something great for us and then we wind up pissed
---
Thought gifts were supposed to be rare from him
---
I got a mounted opposum plan.
---
Yeah, the eyebot mentioned Haven church, which I believe is part of that quest. Oh well it was still cool to see
---
Increasing camp budget will hurt stability FYI
---
I have Max perks for buying stuff and it still came out at I think 1428.  I had a bunch of serums start up so each time I would buy one or two I would sell back the serums so in essence they cost about 1170.  Then since the chemist perk for some reason works you build two for each wrapping paper. And then each present gives you 50 or a hundred caps back so now the average price is around 1,100 each.
---
I have two characters in both were sitting right under 20K so I was able to buy about 30 wrapping papers and turn it into 60 gifts.
---
It’s either extremely rare or it doesn’t actually give you presents
---
Ironically named might I add
---
If a tse shotgun would spray 27 rounds in 2 seconds with infinite range and no spread it would kill 10 times faster than an explosive laser.
---
There’s another side quest over there
---
All of the OP's post made sense. 
---
Unlike your horrible piece of an incomplete sentence. It's like when I have to train my 3 year old not to demand "Cookie!" or "Water!"
---
Reference?  I've never seen anything that stated or showed an increase the rate.
---
Santa Claws
---
Ahhh shit... here we go again .
---
Your still getting rewards, it’s just not showing. Check collection tab for scrip after every daily
---
No. And AFAIK intelligence and luck don’t matter.
---
That’s where your wrong buddy, I’ve had people complain to me that “it’s my armor, it’s my legendary handmade” and then took all my armor off, completely naked no outfit so they could see I wasn’t wearing any and crafted a non legendary Handmade in front of them and modded it and took on full teams like this and still won, has nothing to do with armor/weapons, yes they help and give buffs but it all boils down to PvP mechanics knowledge your build and pure skill, and the good pvpers DO play nuclear winter, the people you’re referring too are the trashcans who think stealthboy/Tesla cheesing is skill, there are more quality players than cheeseballs though. Also Nuclear winter does get boring and at times you just aren’t in the mood for a battle royale, I’ll dust your boots in either mode my man it doesn’t matter to me, you shouldn’t speak about subjects you have no clue about it just makes you look idiotic and I hate to break it to ya but the vast majority of god rolled weapons/armor floating around is duped.
---
I wouldnt lie :)
---
Same rules as assualtron key cards
---
Got one pal using berserkers. Bastard puts in work
---
Do you know if Super Duper works eithbthat as well?
---
The chances were stated to be 1%.
---
It does not, didnt hit once in all 30.  Quite honestly chemist shouldn't work either as it has nothing to do with chemistry and it's built at the Tinkers bench. I'm really hoping they don't fix it at downtime.
---
Oh I know. Like i said. Game needs fixed first.
---
also while you're at it go ahead and buy wrapping paper from the store and equip the chemist perk because it actually doubles the amount of presents you're able to make
---
Feels like it has about the same tbh, just more spread around whereas Morgantown’s loot is usually all in the named places. Flatwoods cratespawns are still the same as it was when it first released too, nobody really had a problem finding loot.
---
Do your own research then because I have seen it in lots of different places.
---
Ahaha get an upvote.
---
50k Deep So far that way, only plans I’m after now is the deathclaw extra claw and plasma grenade, I’ve Been busy as I’m off work for a few days
---
Well I better take advantage before they "fix" it.
---
It just works
---
Well that’s just not in the Christmas spirit
---
I got a t51 right arm last night, was so happy to finally get a plan through gameplay, and not someones vendor
---
As an update, apparently putting it in Fullscreen mode helped a lot. I am not sure why. I played on Borderless Windowed for months when the game came out and it was fine. I guess something changed there. Now that I am back in the game, I am remembering the framerate issues. Some areas I can get 120 fps...staring at a cliff wall. But if I turn around and look at a city, I drop to 45 fps. I forgot how poorly optimized this game is. I guess I am gonna try and tweak the .ini file to see if I can improve some stuff. Wish me luck.
---
Never happened tobme, but damn these aliens were scary af in Doctor Who...
---
Well fuck the brotherhood anyway
---
All I got from it were stimpacks
---
Learn? What?
---
Also Harper's Ferry (when it's occupied by Scorched instead of Super Mutants)... I usually get two holiday scorched there. There's 1 at the *very* bottom of the steps leading to the church, just before the 3 turrets... From that same spot, looking up at the church, turn right and walk all the way past the patio furniture and there's 3 scorched in front of a house at the end. One of them is usually holiday...
---
Two more at Safe n' Clean Disposal... From where you spawn in at, turn around and you'll see a bridge with a truck under it... If it's Scorched that spawned under the bridge, 2 of them have always been holiday themed for me.
---
But this overload of legendaries is. Also noticed last night getting scrip from gifts too
---
Dkhtf this got down voted... Jesus, nvm... reddit is fucking toxic.
---
I’d like a hyper modern skin for the crossbow.
---
Oh I’m not complaining about the countless 2* I’ve had, I’ve got 1 mule filled up last night
---
totaly agree i dont understand why those d#ckheads at bethesda did this
---
These three that commented for each platform came to your aid like Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. That’s awesome. Get that backpack!
---
I have a spare gorilla head and plasma grenade (among others) on xbone if anyone's interested.
---
Hope ya dont mind but I copied this and edited my OP with it
---
More budget less players more budget less players more budget less player nah seriously I don't mind either way
---
Any data or just personally speaking?
---
It's not pre-accessing, it was always here. That's just the normal map, and from time to time people had always encountered the glitch that allows you to cross the border (don't tell to Trump)
---
No worries
---
Thank for the reminder, I added an edit to my OP stating that
---
Pride is for accomplishments. Trolling you is too easy to consider it an 'accomplishment'. Maybe if your Troll-jitsu were better... You're just a toy to play with as I'm bored, sitting in my car, waiting to clock in. TBH though you're just barely less boring than sitting in silence. As far as 'productive use of time', you're on Reddit asking pointless questions about a video game. Not exactly productive use of your own time either, is it?
---
There was a Fall Camo skin datamined a while back.
---
Got two large holiday gifts in one run. One inside starting at the west end of Big Bend Tunnel and one at the eastern exit
---
There was a nice Christmas tree in Fallout 4, that would be nice to be honest.
---
OwO
---
Go to map (options button, front face of controller to the right of the touchpad), then hit L1 (left hand side shoulder button)select quit and your done.
---
Unless it was renabled with the latest patch this hasn't worked since February. I remember all too well as I had just spent a few hours exploring the border regions before it was patched the very next day. Not that I found anything too exciting but it at least gave me something new to explore.
---
Random amounts of caps too which I was not expecting. One large gift gave me 50 and the second one I opened right after gave 100. Not too shabby since I got rare armor plans from those as well.
---
And the vlue freestate one for all armors,but who knows when they'll ever come.
---
For all we know they could be a reward for sticking with a faction in wastlander.
---
Anyway i find it absurd that ,after a year, there is not at least a skin for every armor and weapon in the game.
---
Fingers crossed 🤞
---
A couple hours. I think one of the spawns was bugged bc I got 5 from one sweep at the Tyler County fairgrounds
---
Any piece of flat farm land is what comes to mind can’t think of one specifically though where you can build for sure. A place like that farm by the Nuka cola plant would be awesome
---
Nope, there have been one or two show up in data mines but so far, no love for robot armour.
---
Buy Fallout 1st for a month and you'll be covered during this event.
---
If you think that's crazy, 10mm SMG users still don't have any kind of Sight for their guns that isn't iron.
---
I actually encountered a glitch where there was a headless naked scorched that couldn’t be killed, it was...
---
An unpleasant experience
---
My mobile phone stays turned off until I need it.
---
Can I have the gorilla head?
---
No data, it's AFAIK. There is speculation on both sides, but it's just that. I've not seen documentation or data mined information, and I've not seen any difference.
---
OMG I totally would love this...  I used to be a Rad-Resist build with Robot armor, but never saw any skins for it, and eventually over time I moved on a motley of pieces.
---
I'd totally love to eventually move back to all robot pieces someday, especially if there was a new skin or two to apply!
---
Only if it’s to take a photo with somebody that trades kills with me often. Lol
---
I santa hunt on my private server so i dont have to deal with competition or people like that guy.
---
Oh, The part about level is Community consensus.
---
Nice and naughty.
---
That is going to be in the game soon. Vendors selling wrapping paper.
---
20 caps each at my vendor ps4
---
It is a good community. You’ll eventually run into the ‘exceptions that prove the rule’, but overwhelmingly it’s a cooperative supportive community.
---
Traffic cones and the blue storage baskets...
---
Rubber and Plastic... come on!
---
thank you! although I wont be on until later tonight. Its about 7am here.
---
I have run into a total of 2 trolls since launch. One followed me around and played henti in the mic at 200 volume I muted them. The other turned me permanently purple. Looks cool but still annoying. Compared to all of the other communities in games I have been this is by far the best. I have a fun time giving away weapons to people who need them.
---
I’m so hoping that they give us decorations in the atom shop for it.
---
My husband and I do something similar.  Hanging out in same room but either paying PS4, sewing, playing on phone ect.  I like to watch him play walking dead and he watches me play fallout.  Good solid marriage.  :)
---
It worked last night on a private worlds but not this morning on public. I just hopped every single faction vendors and checked.
---
I’ve been accused of hacking/cheating on NW PS4. Makes me laugh because I have an underwhelming set up and get wrecked half the time.
---
Bad and naughty children get given to the Santigo
---
I got it 100 hours into the game by a pure stroke of luck at Battle Bot, except when i tried selling it everyone claimed i duped it and if they didn't they said that "actually everyone has it because of duping". You're only really happy about getting if you were trying to learn it.
---
Yeah, someone told me two days ago that they would find me and kill my family infront of me and then kill me aswell. It was beautiful.
---
NPCs like previous games which is what they plan to add in Wastelanders cause they know the current approach sucks.
---
That's the standard "hello" in GTA Online.
---
My guess April though wouldn't be surprised if it was pushed back and delayed again.
---
Its only textured from the top dummy
---
Bruh why you want me to buy a domain name
---
I can build a rocket launcher from scrap but I’m unable to cut a tree down for wood.
---
I was more amused than annoyed, but still. Just because you play a certain game doesn't maje you more or less toxic.
---
Doing it right now.
---
Christmass hadn’t begun yet, theres still hope
---
And a Krampus-squatch
---
I would be against it. It would just be used by people to provoke pvp. Those same people who rush to a workshop that was unclaimed for hours just to kill you would keep raiding camps with the same goal.
---
I've met maybe one troll on 76. GTA, I got an orbital strike within the first half hour I ever played the game. There's a stark difference between 76 players and GTAO players. Hell, I didn't even know passive mode was a thing in 76 till someone on this sub pointed it out.
---
Just FYI, Afaik this is still accurate

[This](https://imgur.com/a/GY17qAk) is what I got from opening 60 of the high quality crafted gifts.
---
Aaah, I understand now :P
---
I went taming mine north-east from Abbie's bunker. 
---
Then you have to wander the aera untill you find a tameable pet. I found my deathclaw somewhere in the swamp up there.  
---
Good luck.
---
Morgantown Airport terminal, overseer cache.
---
Then I guess those people who claim that as soon as you claim a workshop there's someone killing you are lying.
---
If you're on PS4, i can be that 76th
---
I mean, they could add diarrhea sounds to diseases.  Wouldn't that be shittier?
---
Morgan town airport in overseer's box
---
Ah! Ok thank you. I thought it was suppose to be at overseer’s camp. :)
---
Got it. Thanks! :)
---
Hopewell Cave has a Matriarch that has access to the outside via no loading screen, there is a fissure site close by so be careful so the Deathclaw doesn't get Scorched
---
Not a one.
---
I have not 😬 I'll have to tune in 👍
---
It was out last year but hasn't been brought back from the vault.
---
It is either the 250DR fix rollback or potentially making chemist not craft 2x handmade gifts.
---
Or both.
---
They’re fixing the reload bug. Also how long are they usually down for?
---
It was announced yesterday.
---
They are reverting the 250DR fix that broke the legendary effects on armour upon reload.
---
i am also freaked out by blue pajama guy, first time i saw that one i spamfired and wiffed about 10 shots. (came out of nowhere around a corner
---
Oh yeah that would make a lot of sense and I’d be thrilled if that’s true and they solved that issue so quickly. Server patches are usually upwards of two hours but if this is a hot fix could be half that.
---
Yeah, the shishkebab is scary as hell.  Looking.
---
You unlock the standard one by doing the Tadpole Pioneer scouts quest line. Just give it a google search and it will send you on the right path.
---
You can find a “small backpack” plan (I’m not sure if that’s name for it, I can’t remember) inside the Overseers chest inside Morgantown Airport. The “small backpack” plan doesn’t require any quests or grinding to obtain.
---
The difference between standard and “small” is that the standard holds more.
---
And I think you were getting pointed to the Atomic shop is because the atomic shop sells cosmetic skins for it, not the actually backpack plans.
---
I’m at 1
---
Tha lnk you guys much appreciated I'll check those 2 spots out later today
---
Please report that behaviour.
---
Oh. I only started playing in the middle of this year. 😋
---
I've seen that several times now.  Starting to like it.
---
Right. I have a high level player but starting a new one now. Just needed to know where new player back is located, thank you.
---
I can’t wait so I can become the chameleon again.
---
Probably not lying at all, just because it’s never happened to me, ever, doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. But I think, challenging someone for a workshop is a game mechanic so it’s not trolling or griefing. It’s just a part of the game.
---
I hope it's the 250DR rollback
---
They’re just reverting it to how it was pre patch. I hope that they fix the stuttering when reloading too. Ok thanks for that
---
I was considering this till I noticed the little shadow character standing next to it was for size reference.  Redwood tree in Appalachia, lol.  If it doesn't eat too much budget I guess you could make your own forrest.
---
Yeah I'm loving the gifts!!! Gotten some pretty cool plans! Finally getting the other mounted creatures I've never gotten through the actual quest!
---
When has it not created more bugs than it fixed.
---
I was expecting a much smaller list:
---
Coal
---
Raw Fertilizer
---
...maybe it's just me.
---
Please don't whine, this is needed to fix the issues which were added in Patch 16.
---
I had this same idea... darn you and your creativity.
---
This is Grafton's Mayor speaking to anyone who can hear me
---
Can anyone hear me? Hello? As I was saying... The Brotherhood of Steel has made an awesome entry. Brotherhood needs your help. Seems they recruited another soldier. They need a proper briefing at the Fort Defiance. The Brotherhood of Steel. Not the raiders or enclave.
---
No no no.
---
Hahahahaba, go away mayor
---
Galleria, Glasses Cavern and Big Bend tunnel too!
---
Plasma nade plan in first 5 small presents, Just need 12 more mounted heads from the presents to finish my collection.
---
Had 3x mothman plans from 20 homemade presents which set me back 15k caps, though got loads out of it and the PA plans are VERY welcomed, mainly need the raider plans as I just love it.
---
Unfortunately with them dropping in the Holiday Event the value is going to decrease.
---
Supposed to be

Once the event is finished it will be rare again

---
I agree with all these comments...I would love more camp budget but only if it didn't compromise the game stability. I'm unable to build some of the new items I've gotten in the scorched gifts...and I have a relatively modest camp, not a huge floating monstrosity. :)
---
Anyone know what takes up the MOST space per item? I know turrets are up there but what else?
---
Something is wrong there; my budget was maxed. I had not built my collectron at my new camp. I scrapped 2 paintings and was able to build mine. If you do have a collectron running you have to store or scrap that one to build the Santatron, you can only have one collectron in your camp.
---
Hopefully it's some kind of holiday event, maybe we'll get a rat king or something
---
It's just you by a bathroom lol
---
Wait why? Is that fix the reason armour has been messing up?
---
Wouldn't be a reward. The point was that it's supposed to be something positive and interesting to get.
---
That is Awesome! It shows how we are able compromise with each other. I completely agree about a solid marriage. I wish you and your family the best this holiday season.
---
Probably after a couple  of months to about half a year
---
I see what you did to what he did there.

Yeah that would be cool! Like some grotesque, heavily mutated Radrat in charge of a Radrat swarm.

I sell scrip at 100 a star when I get full of crap scrip. These santas drop garbage like mad.
---
This Just in !
---
24 hours old news
---
Lights, walls, any of the work benches. My gf got rid of a few of her garden plants and her fermenter and brewing station  to make room as she never used them.
---
Yes
---
Just downloaded the game to play during the F2P time, to see if I enjoy/wanted to buy.
---
 
---
Saw its in maintenance..
---
Guess I'll try later! lol
---
Yup. They mentioned it in yesterdays ITV
---
Oh options, you mean the button that is nearly impossible to hit without touching the center pad? Who designed that thing?
---
Thanks!
---
How did they turn you purple if you dont mind me asking?
---
I will give you my duplicate plans for that plasma plan
---
I'm currently a pc player, so it won't help much
---
With chemist, you can craft 2. In full unyeilding and rank 3 hard bargin im getting paper for 1400. So 700 a present.
---
Well that’s something to look forward too, I guess I’ll start farming them properly and see if I get lucky, thanks.
---
Likely from 4pm GMT(11am ET) they'll appear via Twitch and Fallout
---
4pm GMT happens when this comment is 2 hours and 8 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/wNkOzdoRI
---
I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.
---
I have more carryweight without.. I'm at 430 and stuffed.
---
I’m a sucker for armour skins so I’ll be grinding for that metal snowflake armour skin. ❄️
---
Nah haven't had the need to do so, however it's nice to have the plan for the RP aspects(yes i'm that kind of person lol)
---
The more I know...Thanks!
---
Thanks im guessing the time I seen on the site was American time zone
---
Why would you dump them?  put them in your vendor and sell them for 50-200 each...people will gobble them up in minutes
---
Twitch Prime rewards should become available 12:30pm ET.
---
Protip: buy the medium quality gift wrapping and open the gifts on a toon below level 5. Reduces the loot table for anything that requires you to be above level 5 to receive.
---
No stash space
---
I did about 15 high quality gifts last and this morning. 
---
The very first one I landed a prime auto handmade receiver, Plasma grenade plan, and winter icicle lights.  
---
The very last one I opened this morning was another Plasma grenade plan, crash Santa, replica grognak axe plan, and prime auto assault rifle receiver. 
---
In between lots of critter heads and nailed a few 500 cap rewards
---
That is why I said that jokingly....I am XBOX and we have a built in chat and trading system
---
I miss Alan Rickman :(
---
It’s down for a few hours lol. Chill
---
You can buy them? I thought they were only found on legendary scorched?
---
Just asking...do you have mules?  why do you have so much stuff?
---
I don't know much about the pioneer scout stuff, but how do we get badges outside of the challenges?
---
True...but when they take it out after christmas people will still want them making them rare and a fun gamble...Ill make 100 of them and then sell them for 2k maybe 3k...investment
---
I have both systems and I will say that even though we have native text capabilities it would be nice if that feature were baked into FO76.
---
What about super duper?
---
Missed an opportunity is an understatement. They dressed scorch in a coat up and called it good. Lmao
---
When Guild Wars 1 released, very early on there was a patch that introduced a new "feature". You could only walk backwards!
---
In contrast to FO76, the game servers were down 10 minutes later, back up 20 minutes later, fixed.
---
FO76 is a great game, in some aspects an amazing game, but it feels like there must be some basic flaw in the engine design or perhaps company policy that causes these constant issues and then makes them so horribly difficult to fix.
---
Yeah Twitch is based in America so follows the American Timezone, can be confusing but you get used to it.
---
I only have one character.  I also do quite a bit of trading so I usually only keep valuable pieces.
---
Yeah at any station in misc section.
---
Damn your 3 stars are a deal!
---
So does this mean you have a better chance at obtaining all the plans? Or are some level locked?
---
yes
---
Yes, there was scheduled maintenance this morning
---
Yep.  Says so in the top right.  Says for maintenance, hopefully they're fixing what they broke with the last patch.
---
Isn’t that just a holiday scorched nearby?
---
Oh definitely will be worth more then that. Im currently stockpiling them like the grinch. Haha
---
Yes, they're doing maintenance regarding the issues with the 250 BR reloading bug introduced in patch 16.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
No :p crafted many and nothing from super duper
---
I don’t know I actually buy and sell a lot of stuff and grind for legendaries as a lvl 278 I have some of the best weapons and armor in the game so legendaries don’t have the same appeal anymore.  
---
The gifts are pretty fun - at least for me anyway.  New items and the random wheel of luck keeps spinning.  I about shit myself when I got the primed auto handmade receiver.  Although I already have that plan and have primed 2 of my 4 handmades it’s truly a rare drop and item that I can sell to someone else for big caps.
---
Really?  My excavator armor adds +100 no matter what my character's max weight without it is.  And if I log out and back in with it on, the power armor bug gives me +200 until I take it off again.
---
Ive crafted over 600 presents with it on, didnt proc once. So im gonna say no. Lol
---
This would be pretty underwhelming but it would be kinda nice to have lockpick 3 or hacker 3 ready to go all the time.
---
Can this be repeated?
---
That's really clever!
---

I hate PvP because I can’t aim worth beans, I’m more of a merchant, I don’t have anything to fight against people. My armor is terrible it is a mishmash of weightless with weapon weight reduction. Most people that are wanted are just looking to PvP and have the rest of their invisible friends.
---
I sold one this morning for 1500 caps.  Have two more and no interest in keeping them so if you are on PS4 look me up and let’s make a deal.
---
Same here. Surely it couldn’t be the armor bug. Perhaps they didn’t beaten to make all the Santa scorched legendary 😂
---
I took all of my low level legendaries and just dumped them outside the vault and in the Flatwoods church. Three stars for sale and I scrip as much as I can... But I am dying for a higher scrip level.
---
I got like 3 back to back gatling lasers that were 18 weight a piece for all 3 star garbage like instigating or exterminating. I'd rather walk then wait. I've really been considering another xbox live gamertag for 5 mules for 750 scrip a day.
---
Yeah, it is 9 am as I write this..
---
Cool. I will have to do that. Thank you
---
Bruh
---
If you have the 1st subscription you can go "Private", put the loot in some world container (a mail box in front of a house for exemple), go back to Main menu and switch to your alternate character. Then reload the Private World, you will get the same you had earlier (if you reload in less than 5 minutes). The mail box will contain the loot.
---
Try it first with junk before you are confident with the routine.
---
I used this to transfer to my second character a mid level lever action gun with supressor crafter by my main character.
---
That's wrong. Nothing affects the odds of learning Mods from scrapping
---
For sure. Thats one plan i dont have. Along with the light and sturdy raider plans that are even more rare. Those only drop from one mission, and its for completing roses quest. If you wanted them all youd have to start a new toon and complete the quest up to that point just for a chance. Rinse and repeat until you get them all. Too grindy for me. Haha
---
Thank you!!
---
I sell Mire and Cranberry Bog maps at 100 caps each and they fly off the shelves. You can almost hear the *woosh*. I frequently leave them on my free loot table as well. I'm on ps4 south of Helvetia on the bridge. &lt;&lt;&lt; Shameless plug. Congrats on the plasma grenade plans, I'm wanting that as well.
---
I think, I could be INCREDIBLY wrong, it is speculation. But alot of wastelanders concept art of characters involved winter-like clothing. Maybe a part of the map will receive season change. And maybe they were planning for this to originally coincide somewhat with this event.
---
It's a pretty big stretch, but it's nice to imagine
---
Maybe it's the toggle that's confusing...whichever one is displayed is what world it is, where normally you would think that hitting it would turn the displayed mode on...
---
This event is dropping it, I have several Brahmin plans I got after crafting and opening.
---
I’ll definitely  try this! Thanks!
---
I’ve seen maps go for up to 150.
---
Before the Prydwen the Brotherhood did have a fleet of airships that crashed, although nowhere near this early in the timeline(about 60+ years later).
---
I’m having more fun than I thought I would 
---
Landed several Plasma grenade plans, icicle plans, a Santa crash, raider blood cleanser plan, primed auto handmade plan, and a lot of critter heads.
---
So you would have wanted them to get rid of all the Christmas stuff, the hidden Wastelanders quest and everything?
---
That's the only thing they could have done quickly.
---
Yeah come to think of it I remember those outfits. Would be very cool
---
I would think the rare plans from the gift would be worth more than the gift box. Why spend 1400 caps on a gift for a chance to get something when you can find someone who is selling the plan you want.
---
I have not come across one yet.  Been mostly hopping to get gifts
---
not sure on xbox, but on ps4 you just team up in main menu, ensure the screen is toggled to team only, then join the server on the fo1 member who is going to run the server.
---
you can't add them later, and if anything weird happens (like the team gets broken or they get infinite looking for world if they have to restart or something) then you probably have to drop back out to main, regroup, and then join the world again. if you do that quickly enough you'll get the same server with no issues.
---
Christ, can you imagine what it'd be like in the Fallout universe?  On fire, radioactive, full of some kind of giant mutant monsters...
---
Sorry im on moble and dont know how. But if you go to the s/fo76 page and type in christmas rewards it was like the 5th one down for me and its 20 days old. The user was u/SkyHiRider i think.
---
You've obviously been a naughty person.  In fact the Santatron has already remarked on that.
---
You could put it in your machine. Now that it's a xmas drop it's likely not super rare. I would start at 5k and see what happens.
---
Thanks for the info! I'm pretty fire/explosion resistant, so it takes them a while to beat me down. However my damage output was just so low. I have a one-star nocturnal LMG, but haven't found anything to add to it. I'll look out for those.
---
Its glorious!
---
Oh really? I my 75 wanted kills so far I haven’t come across that situation once.. 
---
I do have set of PvP gear which I used in survival mode but haven’t been using it for any of my post survival wanted kills. With the exception of my FFFR gamma gun when the wanted person has had a bloodied build.
---
Just for kicks I threw one of each in my vendor at absurd prices. Small at 2k medium at 3k and large at 7500. Same dude bought all three within 10min. 
---
I was surprised
---
Bethesda has a track record of doing these DXP events on days Im not able to play much. Right now I have some time to play but later on I have thing to do such as going to work and such.
---
Thats deffenetly how some will view it but its going to be like the scrip vendor.People do it for the gamble at s chance of something great. The presents will act in a similar fashion
---
So the only other way to get the badges is by completing the individual badge requirements. Those can be found in the Challenges/World menu. There are Tadpole badges and Possum badges. Some are easy, others have pretty crazy requirements. Getting them all was previously thought to be almost impossible since you had to craft a plasma grenade for one.
---
You could be right. Players have shown screenshots with snow. Maybe the savage divide will be snowy in Wastelanders.
---
Yeah we encountered that straight after the patch and found the answer on another Reddit post but even when it was set on team only we still couldn't get any one into the world without them being kicked out by the game 30 secs later.
---
Truly one of the best baddies in film history, in that movie.
---
The excuse for the lack of photos of cryptids has always been "I saw it but I didn't have a camera".
---
In 2019 that doesn't fly.  More or less everyone over the age of about 4 is carrying a camera all the time.
---
Yes. I do this every day :) one runs on ultra, the other on low
---
Thats what im talkimg about! Good for you man
---
They announced yesterday they’re doing maintenance this morning
---
Don’t know why you were downvoted on this, I do the same thing.
---
Yea probably why so many games sell loot boxes. Might be on to something there.
---
Entitled much?
---
I hate you right now. I’ve had every stupid mounted plan under the sun 4 times over, but this stupid plan still eludes me. I think I might retire from fallout when/if I do ever get it. ;)
---
The small backpack plan just dropped for me as a Xmas gift. Didn’t even realise I didn’t have it.
---
If that is the case, and it makes sense that it is, then what will Wastelanders do? There has to be a way to add things in right? Im no game developer but isn't it just Mo Power ? Lol...
---
A lot of assumptions made here.
---
I'm on my 3rd play through of the game.  My primary character is level 250.  My second got to level 75 before I abandoned him due to not liking playing as a shotgunner.  My current character has had the absolute worst luck of the three, but hasn't worked any less hard than the other two.  My primary sells 7000-10000 legendaries a play session, when I play him, my current sells 100 screws and 50 stimpacks a day (because I have so many extras I don't know what to do with them).  I love the character because he is by far the smartest of my builds and I am a better player ... but he has absolutely horrendous luck with drops, encounters, anything that requires the RNG dice of computer algorithms to partake of.  "Put in the effort" ....l.o.l. Sounds like something my primary might say to my tertiary, simply because privilege never recognizes itself as privileged.
---
Hey, aren't you that one guy that left the game in survival when I was about to kill you?
---
I think it is confusing as well. It doesnt tell you which way it is. At least not on Xbox - my friends and I were trying to join mine last night and we just switched it back and forth til it let us in :(
---
I don’t know, am I? Nice of you to remember though, must have been annoying :)
---
always blows my mind that people miss those.
---
Not really.  I've been in a camp that was overbuilt by 4x budget, and the only stability problem was it loaded in slower.  But it just felt like normal server lag delayed loading.
---
Ahh that sucks...all I could think of, GL!
---
Doesn't appear to be in the loot pool according to this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0
---
Yeah I wish there was a giant tree at Whitespring. I would love to leave random presents there.
---
That's a big leap from what I actually said, my point being at least some other games do not have this problem. So I'm actually asking for them to take down the servers, fix it in 20 minutes, and be done with it.
---
Let the laughter and ridicule that this could happen commence.
---
Lol I like this!
---
When I buy the gift wrap from the robovendors and craft, then open, gifts it seems like I get one almost every time.  You might want to try that route.  Just make sure you have the Chemist perk equipped so when you're at the tinkerer's workbench you can craft 2 gifts per wrapping paper instead of just one
---
Wait have they actually? Do you have a source or something I can see? Just curious 😂
---
an image can have a lot of hidden meanings... for me this guy just launched a "red rocket" in the restroom and now feels a lot better.
---
Next time he'd be more carefull about eating old dog food :)
---
Got ya!!  Mules will help and 1st makes a huge difference..... I have 4 characters, 2 main and 2 mules....With 1st you get rid of all your junk and can transfer items to the mules
---
Thanks!  So excited to treat myself to dozens of presents tonight!
---
"Oh, is that for me? Swan, you shouldn't have!"
---
They don’t care about those who would like to play many hours a day, they keep playing anyways. Instead they want to make sure those who only play 20 minutes won’t feel bad.
---
Well yea. 
---
 I don't blame those ppl that bum rush workshops. There's nothing to do! You know that too. I'm presenting a new idea that can keep us awake during this slow steady syrup flow of garbage content we have. 
---
They took out survival mode which was what should have been the whole point.. . Walk amongst the other wastelanders and decide for yourself if they're friend or foe. Or if you yourself are a friend or the foe
---
I don't get it.. My idea is one of the EXACT reasons this game should exist. 
---
Why even have a camp? "Cool shag carpet bro! Is that the front porch w the potential for a banjo and tuba duet?". "Hello fellow player, would you like to sit upright in this chair I purchased? You can swivle the view sorta.". "and here is my most prized possession, a mutant frog in a jar. I know everyone has this same exact one but.. this one is mine". 
---
Can you answer me this; why do we have doors that lock? Why do ppl lock doors? Do you? If so, why? Everything finds its way in somehow and trys to destroy your generator. No one can steal anything, why is it there? Certainly not to provoke cave crickets from entering. Does the scorched hive mind collectively understand lockpicking? 
---
OK ok, try and imagine : 
---
You're rummaging the wastes looking for scrap and you see a camp. You walk to it, the door is unlocked and so is every other door at the camp. Every bench is available. "this room has toys on the floor! awwe this must be a whole family living here. aww". What's that? A cell door in the back of the camp? Thru the steel bars you see haphazardly stacks of  cap stashes in a corner of room that doesn't seem to fit the rest of the camp. But THIS door is locked. Locked w a very simple lock.. Almost TOO simple of a lock 🤔
---
Anyway, yea dude, to provoke pvp. That's pretty much what I was implying but using an other much more fun way of putting it out there.
---
Imagine the community could donate the presents they didn't want and then Bethesda would donate money to some charity based on how many presents we put under it😎 Probably never happen but uno
---
Just some screens people posted on here over the months
---
Well, if you’re a higher level player (level 30 - 40+), then you wouldn’t necessarily need it. Right?
---
Can't go anywhere near a fissure with my current equipment.  I don't stand a chance against a mob of  high level guns and a scorched beast baring down on me all at the same time. (My current character has the worst equipment I have ever had at his level - nothing legendary, nothing valuable).  Suppose I could go to Charleston and fight some lv 1 Scorched, yippee, fun.
---
No probably not..
---
Rareish, it's nice to have a cosmetic type weapon haha
---
Thank you.
---
A unique Sheepsquatch could have been Krampus too.
---
I got the frog last night, but can't remember what size of gift I got it from
---
So did I :) have both 2 accounts and F1st :)
---
Ok so am missing the mutant hound head only
---
My question is why are you looking at Mrs. ScorchClaus's undergarments and legs...
---
Thanks, the server crashed so within 5 mins of logging in
---
Map prices? I just sell them for 15 caps each in my machine. No wonder people buy them immediately
---
They're dropping from gifts that the Santa Scorched drop. You can also go to train stations and pay different sizes of wrapping paper, then go to a tinkerer's bench and craft them with just a little adhesive.  If you equip the chemist perk, you craft 2 gifts per wrapping paper instead of just one.
---
Regardless of whether you craft them or pick them up off Santa corpses, the gifts will be under your aid tab and you just have to open them.  As an FYI, I seem to have better odds at getting mounted heads from the ones I craft
---
ok boomer.  
---
;-)
---
My current char is somewhere in the 20s and I still do that event every time I see it. Even though all the legendaries are basically useless to my character they're still worth it as easy scrip and if I come across anything good I hold on to it and gift it to low levels when I see them wandering around. Not to mention my character has been living on Wolf ribs pretty much since level 5. Lol.
---
Can you put them in a display case? If yes, i will definitely do the same!
---
I feel like I just gave you the same info twice.  HAHA.  Didn't realize you were the same person as in the other thread until after posting.
---
They said they weren't going to be having it this week on last week's stream.  It had to do with holidays, not that they weren't going to do them anymore.  They'll have one this coming Wednesday.
---
Wow, thank you for doing this!
---
I just bought my first month and have a question to add: next month when I don't re-up the scrap box will remain in my CAMP for ease of use for other 1sters and for me to pull from, I just can't *add* to it, correct?
---
If you're on PC it's nowhere near as buggy as this sub would lead you to believe. It seems like PS4 players have it the worst. I play on PC and experience almost none of the things I see people here complaining about.
---
Is high level enemies better?
---
Well that particular bug seems to be getting sorted today, as in they're bringing back another broken weapon bug to undo their shitty efforts to fix it in the first place.
---
Not sure what beta hater means, and I have my own opinions thank you.
---
I got Ionized Meat twice from Large Gifts.  Bah humbug!
---
Thanks! alot of us will appreciate this
---

---
You area awesome! I’ve found a few of those spots too!
---
Coal, fertalizer, and a couple Mr. Jangles.
---
Thats it so far.
---
Maybe they don't understand the gift wrap mechanic, because you can make your own large gift for \~1,400 when buy the paper and craft it at a workbench.
---
I got a couple of foxes, myself. 😘
---
Don't you mean Krampus?
---
Time to start 1 shotting the bosses when I see them!

I think they had the ATX tax behind them, so they will probably be atom shop

Sir, per Article XI of your Appalachia HOA handbook, any mulch used must be fully organic and must not contain any rads (ie feral ghouls, radscorpions, radroaches, glowing creatures, etc.)
---
Did I say I love you today?
---
I stole you pic to use when I get on later, thank you for sharing this!😊
---
That's awesome!
---
Yeah, 40 scrip for 300 caps (7.5c each) is really good deal. 
---
1125 caps for your daily scrip limit means even a low level character could earn that daily just to cycle through legendaries to see if they get one that suits them, at least for a while.
---
how does one "hate videogames"
---
You’re selling your legendaries.  That’s a lot of scrip to waste.
---
He gives you a complete giddy up buttercup sometimes.
---
No Big Bend Tunnel ?
---
FWIW, I didn't complete I am become death until almost L150.
---
If you have a fair amount of scrip, spend some time with Mrgph looking for weight reduction armor.   3 of those, plus a (chameleon piece) goes a long way to offset the I have that! mutation.
---
Abraxo scraps to acid - I pick up almost every box I see ...
---
The irony there is my camp is on an acid node.... :)
---
Excellent info. Cheers buddy
---
Yes of course. What a dumb question...
---
Correct.
---
It is there :)
---
What was removed
---
Friends.
---
It adds the carry weight but you lose what you have on your base armor. So it doesnt add as much if you lose armor effects like unyielding (more strength = more carry weight) and deep pockets on each armor piece to the point where you can carry more without power armor
---
Oh sorry I actually forgot that it has an entrance in the cranberry bog. Nice list my man 👍❤
---
I guess because I made the picture I took of my character over a dead santa scorch into a meme.
---
Download size?
---
Thank you 👍
---
The question, "Why are you all still playing" gets asked here every day multiple times a day now.
---
I'm still playing for the same reason others are still playing - we like the game.  That's what it boils down to.  We play it because we enjoy it.
---
*"But it's a buggy glitchy dumpster fire!"*  No it's not.  Maybe it's the way I play versus the way other people play, I don't know, but I don't encounter many bugs during a play session.  The AP with the jet pack on my power armor is a little wonky sometimes since they overhauled the power armor system, but that's usually the only thing I encounter in a few hours of play.
---
*"But the constant crashes and disconnects are unbearable!"*  I don't get many crashes or disconnects.  I don't know why so many people report this.  It has not been my experience with the game.  I usually play it on an XBox One (not X or S, just the old base model), although I own it on PC as well and play that occasionally.  I live in WV so it's not like I have Google Fiber Internet.  Still, I don't have the performance issues that some people report.  
---
Am I supposed to stop playing because other people experience glitches or disconnects?  That would be silly.  Of course not.
---
*"But they [insert some business/money complaint here]."*  Some of the complaints about Bethesda in this regard are just plain false.  I won't get into it now, but there's a lot of stuff that has been said that just plain isn't true.  However, for the sake of argument, let's say that the detractors are correct in the broader sense:  Bethesda is just a money-hungry corporation who want to charge customers for everything, including some things that should be free.  Well, welcome to capitalism.  Companies do not care about you.  Companies do shitty things.  Companies work so that they can get money.  This is the way capitalism works.  I long ago made peace with the fact that every dollar I spend gets put in the hands of people who don't deserve it.  Even if a company itself is beyond reproach (big if!), their employees go and dump a percentage of that dollar into something I wholly disagree with anyway.  This is life, and it's not fixable until society as a whole evolves past a whole slew of things that go way beyond the scope of any video game.  
---
Am I going to deny myself something I enjoy because of that?  Of course not.  I might as well just hop in the grave if that's the case, because every penny I spend has some degree of destruction attached to it.  
---
I eat meat even though the meat industry is destructive.  I take allergy pills even though the pharmaceutical industry has some big issues.  I own two cars even though they contribute to climate change.  I post on Reddit even though they have done some questionable shit in the past too (just like you do).  And I still play Fallout 76, for the same reason I do all of the above:  It enhances my experience as a barely-smartened-up ape clinging onto this rock floating through space, hurtling toward oblivion, destined to be forgotten and leave no trace by the end of all things.
---
I hope that's a sufficient explanation.  I don't know what else to tell you.
---
No download. May have been background on xbox though
---
Is this a rare drop?
---
it was...
---
Respect to other poster's, but this made me crack up.
---
I agree and welcome to Appalachia :)
---
I ask that myself almost everyday. To farm atoms i guess,i am probably in the top 5 atom farmers.
---
I have the 100% CAMP budget bug. 
---
IT IS A REAL BUG AND, IN MY EXPERIENCE GOING BACK AND FOURTH WITH BETHESDA, THAT IT IS AN UNACKNOWLEDGED BUG THAT BEGAN DURING THE JUNE 10TH PATCH! 
---
Sorry for the Caps it just really bothers me. Especially because some of us have spent real $$$$$$$$ on this game and we aren’t able to use our purchases as intended. This to me is the REAL PROBLEM. 
---
This bug needs to be acknowledged and refunds need to be issued. 
---
Moving your CAMP solves the issue temporarily and other times it doesn’t help at all. After any major patch, like from this past Tuesday, your CAMP goes right back to being bugged. 
---
Deleting CAMP items returns zero budget to your CAMP most times and would require you to demolish your CAMP to build a single item. That’s unacceptable.

One of the culprits in the Neon signs (not the letters, think Nuka Cola sign or the Mothman sign that light up). They changed how these items affect budget. Sometimes just deleting these will get you some space back. Build quickly though because a blue screen or inadvertent log off could potentially ruin any regained budget. 
---
I’d like to say I’ve been patient but that was in the beginning. At this point I don’t appreciate the 🤷‍♂️ “we tried nothing and we’re all out of ideas” routine.
---
I have a few ideas. 
---
Refund my purchases. Fully.
---
Or give me unlimited atoms so that I may buy and own everything thus making the bug irrelevant. 
---
Then I can use things that are still functional in-game, such as clothes, weapons and armour skins. 
---
Bottom line is; after you’ve reached end game and can no longer CAMP build (my personal fav part of Fallout) there’s LITERALLY nothing left to do making this game obsolete. 
---
I don’t want the game to be obsolete. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
you type in gift and wrap in the search bar
---
and stuff like this pops up

I wanna tell that to the Gutsys at Sugar Grove. Started a horde event, Sugar Grove was nearest to me so I fast traveled there, as soon as I spawn I hear absolute chaos and get the mission complete message. Thanks, Col. Fucking Gutsy.
---
Right on, i mightave just missed it but the ice lights and deathclaw head arent on the list
---
I absolutely will continue to complain about this game, as letting Bethesda know what they've done is the only way they'll ever potentially improve. Staying silent and buying 1st and Atoms give them no incentive to improve. You don't like it? Tough. Block me I guess.
---
At any rate, I actually do like the game (in short bursts). I'll be playing this weekend for double XP.
---
What I don't like is that it's a broken, unfinished, unpolished game that was sold for $60+ and is still broken, unfinished and unpolished after a year. I don't like how microtransactions take priority over everything else. I don't like how they can't introduce bug fixes without breaking other things, and even when they do manage to fix some bugs, they're minor bugs. I don't like how Bethesda locked a bunch of highly requested community features behind a paywall, a subscription, for a broken game. I don't like how Bethesda has lied to us. I don't like how the players don't seem to care and continue shelling out money for Atoms and 1st even though the game is still broken, then they complain that nothing is getting fixed. Well yea, the game is broken and you're giving them money anyway. What's their incentive to fix anything (serious question)?
---
I have been waiting all week to play tonight. This is the best present farming post I have seen yet. Thank you.
---
This is perfect!  Last night I was thinking we should get a collaborative post going where everyone offers up their best locations to farm Scorched...    Or you could do all the work for us and I am totally OK with that.
---
Thanks!  Much appreciated.
---
A sentry bot mounted head plan pls
---
If you have damage numbers on, you can use those headless scorched to test weapon damage on an inmortal, unmoving target.
---
You can even land stealth crits and headshots even though there's no head to shoot, the hitbox is still there.
---
This. Gambling mechanics working here. So this is actually a lootbox.
---
Thank you for letting me know.
---
Basically you buy the gift wrap from the vendor. Then you go to the Tinker workbench and you craft it. It's under gifts. And you have the option to either give it to someone or open it yourself. You can't give the ones that you loot from the bodies
---
I couldn't agree more.  I always have the problem when moving stairwells.  Definitely going to follow this as it happens more often than not.
---
3- rename your Power armor.
---
1,2,and 3 Death has consequences.
---
Or crazy turrets.
---
Did I miss a memo on a cap limit raise? How do you have over 26K caps?
---
I was at Gaulley Mine with my latest character (about lvl 5 at the time) when a player gifted me a level 5 Troubleshooters Hunting Rifle.  Robots have a lot of armor at that level and the rifle was awsome.  I’m sure he picked it up from Leader of the Pack and gifted it like you.  I try to do the same thing....I just hope they realize what I gave them, lol.
---
Cool. Thanks
---
I'm AFK, did they rollback the version number or is it still 1.2.6.2?
---
Whitespring station + berry mentats + perk card. 1400 each wrapping.
---
2. If you have the misc quest "Retrieve your dropped loot" active in your pip boy - it should direct you to your bag unless you've died/picked up more junk/died again. It will only go to your most recent death bag. 
---
3. You can "Inspect/Rename" your power armor so you don't have to struggle figuring which is which.
---
...dick.
---
That would be neat too.
---
Grape
---
Lol someone downvoted the idea of giving to charity
---
Still same.
---
Turrent sees ghosts.... must destroy them...
---
You can also put on the chemist perk to craft double the presents!
---
Always aim for the best quality in all your life choices (if you can afford them).
---
Sweet
---
Make sure to always do collision course at Morgantown airport! That event always has at least one legendary scorched!
---
Grape, right, brain damage detected, looking for a new brain.
---
for the launcher status icon to update you need to re-select the game in the launcher
---
Let the people who hate it, hate it. That's up to them. I just enjoy the game and playing with my friends. We get lost in Appalachia for hours just doing stupid shit. There's so many different things to do.
---
Ranged weapons only.
---
You can make holiday gifts at your camp
---
Folks, this what abusive relationships look like.
---
Eek barba durkle!
---
I was having such a freaking fun time last night farming the scorched. The little jingle bells cracks me up and makes me excited every time. Plus I got a TON of low level legendaries and I scripped a bunch and gave away pieces to the newbies that I've been seeing come in &lt;3 Feels good man.
---
I believe the perk requires that the weapon be modded with a supressor.
---
This is so cool.
---
This game is a fucking joke.
---
How did you get the wendigo on the wall
---
Theres a scientist in jakobstown that could help you out.
---
always glad to help the helpless
---
googling is hard!
---
Did you play nuclear winter first before logging into Adventure? If so that's a known bug that auto-completes most (if not all) of the dailies without rewarding atoms. Always be sure to hit up Adventure first before going into nuclear Winter, at least until it's fixed.
---
Same.  I grind a lot in the AM but I look forward to when my friends hop on in the evening.  They're the best.  As a stay at home parent I don't get a lot of social interaction and this game filled that void.
---
Daily’s still work for me it’s a what do you call it a graphics issue you still complete it’s and get the items and exp but it doesn’t tell you you did the daily does still disappear from your mission quest. So yes it still does work little annoying yes game breaking no
---
thanks for the help buddy
---
I am become death shouldn't be too hard if you are level 90. I've been running the silos since shortly after 50 without much difficulty. Basically, if you can handle Mr. Gutsy's and Assaultrons and work well in stealth, you shouldn't have any problems running a silo. Just make sure to bring along power armor for the radioactive portions and plenty of ammo. As for taking down the queen, scope out your server. If there are enough high level players on there and you leave Drop Site V9 out of the blast zone, people will show up and help you take the queen down. Make sure to put Fireproof 3 on before you fight her though.
---
The thing about perks is that you want to make as many of them combat focused as possible. You're better off getting armor that does weight reduction stuff, look for legendaries that reduce weapons, food and ammo weight. It's ok to have a couple convenience perks like thru hiker, but when you want to do harder stuff you will usually swap most of these out for your combat perks. Stuff like bloody mess, action boy, blocker, etc all really make a big difference in your ability to dish damage and take damage depending on your build and are better than equipping a bunch of QOL perks. You can always swap those perks back when you are just junk hunting. Look on the subreddit for stealth sniper builds, there's lots of them that can dish out serious damage to the queen even without being bloodied or junkies.
---
thank you kind stranger.
---
The one where you reload and the armors prefix stopped working until you took it off and put it back on.
---
They've been messed up since the update Tuesday. Some say they are still getting the rewards but i haven't bothered with them since i ate moldy hotdogs and nothing popped up when i was done.
---
Group of enemies together, typically NPC’s.
---
😂 Nothing against people that like the game, but this is hysterical.
---
I'm a masochist
---
Npcs And anything that is alive that’s not a player scorch supermutants exc
---
Lol thats only good for seeing their intent. I think its better to ask other players whats really happening.
---
I'm thinking enemy creature. But depends on how they used it in a sentence.
---
Why did we need a term for that?
---
I get this every single time I move my camp. Even if the blueprint shows green like it can be placed. Will not place it. There needs to be a feature where if one or two things can't be placed then they can be omitted from the blueprint. Odds are it's just one item with an issue but you can't know which one until it tells you.
---
Awesome, thanks for the responses.  
---
Ill work on renaming them.  Much appreciated.
---
All I can say is minecraft
---
To specify the difference between players and enemies you fight
---
There are good players-who care-out there. It can certainly be frustrating sometimes but if you play enough and have a headset you’ll eventually find a team you work well with. Despite all of it’s shortcomings (balancing issues, stability, etc.) as a game mode, NW can be really fun with the right team.
---
I logged in and pulled my guns out of my stash, reloaded a bunch of times and unyielding stats didn't change so I think it is fixed
---
I thought so too lmao
---
People play just for the rewards. I hate NW. I only play it for the rewards. I'm somewhere around level 28 and I have found maybe 3 people that were actually interested in playing as a team. But 20 points for a kill is no where near enough to make people get out of bushes.
---
Havent touched NW in months so no.
---
Do t forget to mine all the ultracite  nodes at each fissure site.  Each node mined triggers more scorch spawns.  
---
Happy hunting.
---
If this is true, it was added within the last week and must be an accident/glitch. The game requests you hit prime site when you get to that quest.
---
Exactly, I was thinking the same!
---
I found by purchasing a loot bag skin, it has been easier for me to find my dropped loot.
---
Play solo my friend. I've won more than a few matches solo. SO long as there's no cheaters, it's not that hard to do well without a team. Yes, there's a lot more sneaking and hiding and waiting instead of aggressive forward movement, but that's the way it's got to work, at least until you can build yourself a decent deck of SPECIAL cards.
---
I went to glassed caverns the other day and no scorched, just eyebots. I think it’s because either the brotherhood or enclave is scouting out the area in prep for wastelanders.
---
When Tony and Giovanni rough you up with a pipe and demand protection money.
---
Yes, but the page I read said something like this: "following a nuclear detonation in the cranberry bog, the scorchbeast queen has awoken from her hiding place in fissure site prime"
---
This suggests that they made it a feature, not a bug
---
Where did you read that?
---
Fallout 76 is the online version of a shitty pub I still go to because my mates are there
---
I was farming scorched last night to scrap combat shotguns for mods, and encountered many of those holiday scorched spawns. Nevertheless, thanks for the location map, it's going to be super helpful tonight. I have to say though probably the best location to farm the Holiday scorched would have to be the Big Bend Tunnel. Last night I found about 7 of them in that area during a solo run inside and outside at both entrances. Scorched are always guaranteed to spawn there so it's good for server hopping.
---
I'd like to mention that the distant thunder event had 3 for me. And it's pretty easy if you have a recon scope.
---
Each point after max gives you a choice of small incremental buffs, like +.5% health regen or physical damage resistance. Takes many to make a noticeable difference. ESO is looking to change their system because of power creep last time I was playing a few months ago, though.
---
Really? It used to be only scorched... Uhg
---
Some servers are robot infested vs scorched infested. Just world hop and the loaded enemies will change. Same thing happened to me, only non-robot was the lvl 80 scorchbeast. Left world, loaded back in and it was all scorched. Happy hunting!
---
Well, I've only ever used it to represent a group of enemies - Ie, you go to the Whitesprings club house, and agrro the mog of Ghouls within.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_(gaming)
---
As far as my personal observation goes Excavator PA no longer wrongly gives an additional +100CW if you log in 'wearing it' so there is that...
---
Not that I particularly wanted this fixed, at least not until another 50 or so bugs - most egregious the CTD when using consumables - that are much higher on my list were addressed but hey, fixed it is; you can rejoice now.
---
I don’t get very many bugs during the average play through either-about the same as other Fallout games actually. I really like the game and find it relaxing-and the people I’ve met/play with on a regular basis are amazing. I may be a demon spawn for “enabling this” or “enabling that” but that is the case with just about any purchase of a product made by a large company. Very well written post by the way.
---
I did not know that, that is fantastic news! Thank you very much!
---
I'm not fully sure. I had gone to about 20 websites, searching for clues that this might be how it works.
---
I've seen this term used a lot in Minecraft.  It is any NPC (friend or enemy).  I believe it is short for "mobile".  I don't know if this originated with minecraft or has deeper history in gaming.
---
It went downhill from there.  I kept server-hopping and redoing this event all evening and didn't see a single scorched Santa on my final run.
---
I'd do the same but with one character constantly at max caps I just dump bag fulls of legendaries and other loot to just keep playing.
---
Such an odd game in many ways.
---
We used to call them enemies. But the kids who grew up playing Minecraft changed it. In Minecraft enemies are called mobs.
---
And now it's a term everyone uses. In the DZ it helps differentiate what I'm talking about. I can say Mobs up a head or Dudes up ahead.  Either way I'll be dead soon.
---
Anyone have a datamine of possible rewards from the gifts?  I need to know if it's truly reasonable to spend 1500 caps per wrapping paper to try to get large ones.
---
This is actually the best method.
---
I have absolutely no desire to jungle resources between characters and shan't be buying multiple accounts any time soon.
---
I mistakenly was that guy.  I saw a level 50 getting overrun by scorched and it never popped up it was a horde event.  I helped him by killing everything.  He was not happy.
---
You can only access the new Scrap Box though between characters?
---
I just hope we see the same amount of legendary scorched after the event is over, but I seriously doubt that
---
I have 3 times so I just ignored them and put on pacifist mode.
---
If we see any confirmation we will know.
---
&gt;let us scrap them with double chance of getting a mod.
---
Would be a great way to use all these legendary items I drop by the road side.
---
I think it is an English word long before Minecraft ever existed :)
---
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mob
---
Get a fucking mic
---
True. I'll definitely be testing this more
---
Stuff like this makes me feel old! Like people calling characters 'toons'. Always sounds weird to me
---
I'm not sure, I think buying 1st has given me new enjoyment, just exploring everywhere that is fresh and not already looted.
---
Your right in some ways but at least in my case I don't have as much caps as other players so I feel that the public event option might have been better or maybe like a middle ground if that was possible. Cause walking in this game takes a while and sometimes real life intervenes and that will cause me and maybe some other players to miss out.
---
What makes you post?
---
I Have both. You still get dads
---
Party on dude, but realize the gaming industry is just as bad as the other industries you listed. And this game manipulates it’s users just like many other games. I am manipulated by this game.
---
Topics if you are interested:
---
manipulation in the gaming industry
---

If you were on pc id pay big bucks for a good exterminators gatling laser

i thought it was shortened in minecraft from "mobile entity"

---
Just went and only got one.  Won't go back.  But top side, got three from SB mobs.
---
is that still working after the patch this morning?
---
yeah cap limit is 30k now
---
Awesome will try later tonight, do scorched drop only the gift or both the gift plus the leg thing.
---
I recently tried a whole new build - new character, new role-play, completely different play style - sucked me right back in - the double xp events are super fun when you have a reason to level up 👍🏻👍🏻
---
Are the chances really that high? I do Campfire Tales every time I see it, probably 100 times or more now, and I've only ever got 1 badge from that.
---
Incoherent crying (like my two year old when he doesn’t get what he wants)
---
Go to the entrance of the Whitesprings Golf Club and throw a grenade.....you will be greeted shortly by a "mob"
---
I like to play around with new weapons, also getting new stuff and helping other people get good stuff.
---
I wouldn't go that far 
---
Its more the irony of making fun of someon'e use of the English language by using the most basically guttural nuspeak possible.
---
Like you wouldn't do that already lol
---
No no jokes are funny this game is sad and pathetic like an orphan with no arms or legs oh with progeria
---
I'm just playing to pass time until I get outer world's for Xmas, I will probably come back for wastelanders until cyberpunk comes out. I don't have a lot of time or money for games, so I have to set a road map
---
good to know, now it's less stressful now.
---
for awhile it was the raids, but the teams slowly died off on them (so glad i got all the challenges done).  now im mostly running events (both world events and real events like the santa scorched one) and queen runs.
---
Each character has it's own unlimited scrap box but you can easily transfer items between...There is an unlimited weight suitcase by Berkley Springs Station....Put whatever you want in it.....Log off, change character, log back in to private server and get the items....You will always log into that server with any character unless you go to Adventure mode or elsewhere for about 5 minutes
---
1 Missing for guns is likely to be the Prime Receiver, only availble from SBQ.
---
As for Armour, Dense and Biocomm are Plans only (Torso Slots). Ultralight is believe to be Plan only, so thats Torso and Limbs. (So 4?)
---
Because I like the game.
---
  Not trying to imply players dont have problems, nor am I trying to deny there are some bad bugs, so maybe I've just been lucky; 
---
By and large, the bugs I've read about here have not really affected my gameplay.
---
  The chameleon/legendary/reload issue?  For whatever reason, it did not affect my character.  I have 4 pieces of WR armor  - it still did exactly that.  So did my chameleon.
---
Disappearing legendary bodies.  Yea, this one I agree with.  Its maddening when it happens.  But at least it doesn't happen very often.  
---
Server crash when you launch a nuke?  Not that I have launched that many, but so far, has been fine for me.
---
  The can't craft a PA helmet got me for a few days, but was taken care of in the next patch.
---
The excavator extra carry weight bug I used to my advantage.  PITA when I accidentally exited. But ya know, I wasn't supposed to have the extra carry weight anyway, so having to relog was the price I paid.  Once I obtained  the flux to add calibrated shocks, that became a non-issue.
---
Nerfed weapon damage?  I never had one of the affected weapons, so I don't know any better.
---
Atom Shop?  You don't need any of it to be able to successfully launch a nuke and kill the queen.
---
Forgetting quest markers during Rose quest and having to redo some steps was annoying, but I got over it.  
---
My biggest complaints are slow scrolling in vendor windows, multiple can't place camp in a row, and the random FPS/freeze.
---
The FPS is only a problem if I am in combat.  Out of combat, its just an immersion break.
---
Bada bing :)
---
After surviving Barrens chat....no thank you unless it it party restricted.
---
Not a faster circle, less time between circle shrinks. Like have it shrink every 30 seconds.
---
Are you sure? I see no update on Xbox. 
---
Although I must say, last time I reloaded I checked my inventory and the legendary effects didn't break, which I found weird considering they broke three times not to long ago.
---
Perhaps there's a way to work around to avoid the bug and reload without triggering it, or it's just inconsistent, but honestly and no offense I doubt it is fixed yet.
---
Dagnabbit!
---
I've seen several occasions where people missed it slightly but the queen still came out. How far off was your nuke?
---
are they going to do the promo on PC side too? want to get a third account as mule.
---
You should also know that any armor mod for a type can be learned from any piece of the type. A marine leg piece, for example, can teach you a marine chest mod. Make the cheapest armor piece and scrap that.
---
Monster or Beast, I used to say mobs in world of Warcraft back in 2005 but was probably around since Everquest?
---
Its the worst PC battle royale I've played from a AAA by a longshot, my winrate is pretty ok when toyz or h4ckmaster aren't in game(a rarity), but the ui, grind for perks(dont forget to spam photomode in the vault), lack of anti cheat really make it dead in the water too me. I dont afk like others but if not for rewards i wouldn't touch it.
---
I've noticed that im parched every 15 min, this has been going on since patch 16, todays roll back havent changed it unfortunatly
---
Damnit man! Last night I went to the big bend tunnel, the camp where you turn in tech data, and Galla and out of the 5 Santa scorched all had small boxes!!! Can normal legendary enemies drop boxes as well or only scorched? It has been good getting scrip weapons regardless tho.
---
I think they will, as the preview shows someone with a longbow. It actually fits into the style of the game IMO. Not everyone in the apocalypse wants to trudge around with mini guns or handmade rifles. The silence of bows and the cover of wood armor would be deadly in the wasteland
---
The perk you want is Ninja
---
Yea the mounted plans are nice, sad im out of camp budget so i cant really place them all
---
Thanks, I wasn’t sure if i was just imagining it or what.
---
"Cannot place item:" while in building mode I have concrete floor chosen, lit red &amp; will not place. I move to wood concrete floor chosen, lit green. I then move back to concrete floor chose, lit green &amp; will place.
---
I believe the problem is within the camp build menu and browsing similar items in the build menu then returning to the chosen build menu item helps making it place-able.
---
For me, Scorch only. The Large were lvl 68's in Big Bend.
---
Sure is, but gen z thinks they invented games and internet. ;)
---
FYI, this term was coined *way* before Minecraft was a thing, we used the term when playing/designing MUDs way back in the day.  That goes back well into the early '00's, and probably much earlier.
---
Quite a ways. It was barely on the fissure site to the west of hers.
---
only my thirst have been affected, eating as much as usual
---
running carnivore and good doggy as well
---
If you haven't switching it to all friends worked.
---
I’d rather have coal than ... crap .. sounds messy
---
Thank you
---
This is the list I had been compiling for a while. It was a mistake for it to be labeled as data mined as that wasn't the case at all. There are definitely some errors and omissions and it was based mainly off my travels and observations.  I have added this data to the master event spreadsheet so please let me know of places that need added/removed: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU\_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G\_G5qKE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0)
---
I played for 2-3 hours last night and didn't get a single gift in my collection box.
---
It's been a strange bug. Not that I doubt it will be fixed, but I noticed not all of my armor broke. My 2 Unyielding pieces and Life-Saving piece didn't break, but my Chameleon piece did, along with my Bolstering piece. Although, to be fair, last night I exclusively used melee weapons to get those Atoms for killing scorched with different melee weapon types.
---
Alright, Imma try it out
---
For what? Not a sarcastic question I'm curious.
---
My diet hasn't changed in ages (2 carrot soup and 2 purified water whenever I need it).  Sometimes it seems like I need to eat/drink more but I've always assumed that the more I server hop and fast travel, the more I Need to consume.
---
I don't *know* that that's true, but I think I remember reading it somewhere, so I assume that's the case.  Could that explain it?
---
The gift drop rate is 1%. It collects every 7 minutes, 20 seconds. That's an average of 1 gift every 12 hours. So you could potentially go much longer than that without getting a gift.
---
The real question is, for multiplatform players, do I get it in both places? Or do I have to pick.
---
There will be much more camp budget.. For 1st members. It literally said so in the original newsletter. The game was rigged from the start
---
The gift drop rate is 1%. It collects every 7 minutes, 20 seconds.  That's an 'average' of 1 gift every 12 hours. So you could potentially go much longer than that without getting a gift. It's all RNG based so it's very hard to predict.
---
Nah my turrets are never working they always get destroyed when people spawn in for my shop
---
He means Daily quests.  Not challenges.  When you finish a Daily like say Lucky Mucker, it just disappears and doesn't give the reward window any more.
---
Don't get your account banned for providing maps
---
This.  You still get the items, just not the reward window.  I verified at the Pumpkin House.
---
Sorry, no. Here's the full list: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU\_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G\_G5qKE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0)
---
Doesn't seem to be working for me.. 
---
:(
---
I love it!!
---
Legendary farming and camp building. I scrapped my elaborate building for a complete outdoor / farmy type camp. Plus, I like to do daily and weekly challenges for atoms.
---
I would doubt it, but i dont know for sure, but i rarely server jump, but im crazy thirsty all of a sudden, having to drink 3 times every 15 min.
---
It's probably speed demon or something, maybe i should try removing/equipping the class freak perk
---
I ran it last night and didn't have a single legendary out of the 5 waves :(
---
Maybe someone else got it, or you didn't see and it ran away?
---
Same here,  so much junk!
---
After reaching 'endgame'  .... yea, I was "now what" for a few play sessions.  
---
The answer is:
---
Going back and doing the stuff I didn't do before I launched.  Believe it or not, that included finishing tadpole and graduating to possum. and completing the firebreather questline.
---
Working on possum badges now.  Backpacker took time, as I actually hoofed it, not FT from place to place.
---
Taming a pet.
---
Finding the magazines I don't have.  Getting the rest of the BoS paints.
---
Still have not done One violent night, Census violence, or campfire tales.   Last weekend, I did Lode Bearing for the first time. 
---
Haven't done v94 (although I was tempted to try it solo last weekend when I was outside the vault door, but given it was 3 am, decided against it) or nuclear winter.
---
Now I have farming the xmas event for all the mounted heads, crashed santa, and icicle lights plans. 
---
Then there's grafton pawn.
---

Here's a sheet with all the rewards and drop odds: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU\_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G\_G5qKE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0)
---
Worth a shot.  Speed demon does supposedly affect thirst, but I've had it forever so it's hard to say.
---
I also tend to server hop a lot, and fast travel a *whole* lot.  Not sure I'd really be able to tell if there was a change.
---
I usually sell them at 50 to 75 apiece
---
That’s a really cool idea. I have a lot of stuff I could give away
---
think you got the wrong forum, there's a market place forum for selling/buying
---
I don't know you but playing with someone is a lot of fun for me
---
Only for nw
---
Damn right, I want progress reports, I want detailed information, I want an explanation.
---
All this new revenue from Fallout 1st Memberships clearly did not go anywhere related to Fallout 76 Development.  You're barely 4 months away from a massive update to the game (Wastelanders) and we're still getting Patches that are breaking the game in areas, still have bugs from day 1 plus more that weren't there at day 1.
---
People are concerned this game is gonna get axed from inactivity cause everyone and their mother is gonna look at it and laugh saying who would dare pay money for this broken bug-filled excuse for a game experience that every couple of months gets 'updated' but actually 'rebroken' in reality.
---
At this point they're literally just shooting themselves in the foot, one toe at a time, one bone at a time.  At this point, they should be offering contractual deals with modders to fix their game for a set salary to actually put such fixes into their updates so they can focus on adding new content and pay people who have the means to stabilize and fix that content.
---
That they don't is just cheap.  But like their IP implies, every big company is cheap, Bethesda is no exception.
---
Nope, I was playing on my private server and I was the only one there.
---
Agreed the wallpapers do make camps look much nicer and give us more customization.  Im only using the Free red and blue ones atm as I don't really like the other ones currently in the store.  I would like to see them add these as at least a "clean" version.  I do find it weird when we make items from base components, that we make them dirty/busted.  Sure Mr. Fuzzy was a vandalized set that we changed tokens in for and did not make, but the Easter Bunny Mask where its split open with an ear missing, is not a choice I would intentionally make.
---
gotta upvote this ASAP.
---
Is it hostile? Store and replace.
---
Then either it ran away, or you've got some terrible luck
---
My friend had same problem there is a option to check boxes in private world some where  I think on main menu you have to check a box and then you can have friends into your world  play around with it and you should figure it out wish I knew exact formula but am broke so play on friends world
---
Haven’t got it still :(
---
I have never had a legendary scorched from that event, didn't know one is supposed to spawn
---
Thanks for the help. We will keep playing with it. Thanks!
---
what is in the gifts?
---
Surface To Air and Line In The Sand are definite mentions, too. Tons of Scorched, and now, we get Legendary Scorchbeasts, too!
---
Good to know
---
Their fear is if it's unlimited,  we will all have the gear we want and quit grinding for daily scrip. I think it's a hollow argument. I would still grind,  since that one thing you want is going to take a ton of scrip unless you are extremely lucky. I actually stop playing daily when I reach my limit and am overweight with extra scrip legendaries. That is limiting my play time,  not extending it.
---
I agree.  Being able to roam instead of locked in to one location does have its advantages.  
---
Because its all over the map, it gives lower levels opportunities they would not otherwise have.  Unlike Mischief night, where new and lower level players likely did not survive very long.
---
It doesn't lock high levels into a lower level area (ala meat week redux)
---
It is. Maybe the player count determines the spawn rate
---
Crops are a big one. As my camp budget ran out, I have systematically gone from an expansive adhesive farm, to a few food crops, to now not having any at all. They are just too expensive to the budget. When I need crops for soup, I can port over to the big farm and harvest corn/razorgrain. I also got rid of my water purifier, as I find enough wandering around for what I need.
---
The budget constraints are really frustrating sometimes. They give us display cabinets for showing off and collecting things, then don't really give us room to use them.
---
They changed it where you need to set someone as person who can join so random people in your friends list can join
---
Damn. Maybe I should try 50 and see what happens lol
---
How do you do that? I invited my husband to team, but I’m not understanding if you preset a team list?
---
I had no idea they were so rare when I put my extra in my vending machine. I'm going to have to raise the price when I log on tonight LOL
---
I realized last night that I don't ever use my brewing/fermenting stations, or my power armor stand, so both of those will be going. That's prime camp budget I can use elsewhere. I can use the brewing stand a Biv's if I need one, and there's a power armor stand near there I can use in the few times I need it as well.
---
I would love to continue to have them in my camp, but I just can't justify the expense right now. I'd rather have the display space. Sad it's come to this.
---
You sound like a thirteen year old pretending to be an adult, like you're three eight year olds in a trench coat sitting on front of a computer.
---
There’s a legendary scorched at fissure sites about 80% of the time.
---
Awesome idea!
---
&gt;"But they \[insert some business/money complaint here\]."  Some of the complaints about Bethesda in this regard are just plain false.  I won't get into it now, but there's a lot of stuff that has been said that just plain isn't true.  However, for the sake of argument, let's say that the detractors are correct in the broader sense:  Bethesda is just a money-hungry corporation who want to charge customers for everything, including some things that should be free.  Well, welcome to capitalism.  Companies do not care about you.  Companies do shitty things.  Companies work so that they can get money.  This is the way capitalism works.  I long ago made peace with the fact that every dollar I spend gets put in the hands of people who don't deserve it.  Even if a company itself is beyond reproach (big if!), their employees go and dump a percentage of that dollar into something I wholly disagree with anyway.  This is life, and it's not fixable until society as a whole evolves past a whole slew of things that go way beyond the scope of any video game.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Am I going to deny myself something I enjoy because of that?  Of course not.  I might as well just hop in the grave if that's the case, because every penny I spend has some degree of destruction attached to it.
---
This made me smile - This is someone grounded in the real world not in some instatwitter fake life.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5w615PH21A It’s real
---
I see what you did there.
---
yes all the time, with crates or dead scrochbeasts dropping from the sky wherever I go
---
Bad ass camp.
---
Were they dropping out of the air whenever you loaded in to a new place? Sounds and looks like the bug with Scorchbeasts corpses.
---
Ends Dec 16th at 7pm ET
---
And a wild mongrel with antlers tacked to its head.
---
Tyvm!!!
---
Dig the gift drops
---
Got my plasma grenade and honeybeast mount in addition to a ton of others
---
Santa crash as well
---
Also is 2,000 caps a good price for the green asylum worker uniform? ty
---
Yes that's correct.
---
I don't know if it's expected to be like that, but while doing "belly of the beast" with an alt character at glassed cavern I met three legendary santa scorched. The three dropped some great urban scout armor, one, two and three stars, plus three gifts which gave me the plasma grenade plans, mounted mothman and crashed Santa plus toys and shit. 
---
I would love them to be rarer but drop unique/special items, like unusual baseball bats or outfits.
---
What?! Do they sound like they're 13 or like three 8 year olds in a trenchcoat? I'm confused.
---
I too love those jingly bastards, been actively hunting them n love that little jingly sound. That's when the hunt begins
---
Nuclear Winter, honestly, and building camps.
---
This, please. Give us a way to display larger items like Giddyup Buttercup and Mr Jangles.
---
Now I need a flaming behemoth to crawl out of the Cuyahoga.
---
It's not my first Watogeo
---
Do you play on public or private servers, and did you use a paper bag or container?
---
Unyielding to have a crazy amount of strength + bloodied weapons. If you go this way it's useless to have a 2H. Even with a combat knife you will one shot almost everything.
---
I think they snuck in a quick update or something last night.... I had 12 of them on my 1st run on that event.   A bit later I got disconnected (in the middle of "Back on the Beat", which I had been trying like mad to find) and when I got logged back into a fresh server, the frequency had dropped way off.  On my last run-through,  there were zero.
---
I was giving two possible different situations, but the end result being the same that this person does not seem "mature" at all, let alone married or a parent.
---
Plans so rare, I've mounted the beaver 4 times. It's a fun grind though. Here's to getting the plans of our dreams.
---
It's because it works with dropping a PA frame for whatever reason, but just dropping items on the ground in your bag will delete them once you log off. Cant even get the stuff with the same character logged back in. I found out the hard way aswell.
---
You need to put the stuff in a static container, like a duffle bag or suitcase at a train station, and it should be there for your other character to grab. I havent tried this personally since I lost my stuff the other way, but that seems to be the consensus on how to do it from the community.
---
I also noticed and add that food spoilage rates have drastically increased what would go bad after several hours of play goes bad in 40 min or less of play and instigating not working when aiming through scope on lever
---
Plus I feel like making the presents are a nice cap sink
---
I have done a few tests, and it seems when I move my CAMP, which is only a platform, if any wall has the wallpaper and a wall decor it makes it "floating". I never had problems moving this CAMP before they added them.
---
Really not a fan of that part of the game so haven't noticed. I just go with my usual "stuff whatever in my mouth until I'm full" - methodology with no concern whatsoever to diseases and rads.
---
Said the shill.
---
Wait. You can craft gifts for yourself? I thought the wrapping paper was just bag decoration for dropping items.
---
Hey thanks for the share man! I’ll pick a spot to setup my CAMP and have some fun sniping!
---
I dont know how you got all that from their post, but ok
---
They are probably going to add a transfer service in their FU 1st subscription.
---
When I couldn’t get a response from anyone I tweeted at support and they got back pretty quick. Could have been a fluke, who knows.
---
I was on a team with 2 people and one went to that destroyed bridge and started shooting the cargo bots. I somehow got through the border and followed the winding road to the point it disappeared and textures started glitching out. I crashed and haven’t been able to get back out there
---
Whats your psn?
---
Its from a quest, just google it.
---
There's a red wallpaper design in Vault 51 I'd love to have if it ever becomes available
---
Technically you can xfer about as risk free as anything with a solo player with 1st.
---
yea, but that's also why random encounters in known locations may be better. 
---
I've got the caps, but I'm too overencumbered to FT ( I know, my fault), so for things like meat week II and mischief night, I was pretty much locked in to those locations for a week.
---
Theres several posts about where scorched hang out.
---
I played for about an hour and a half last night.
---
  Spawned in at camp, which is near Bolton greens.  There,  I heard the santa scorched, but could not find it, so moved on to Morgantown. None in the trainyard.  But at the airport, I found  1 legendary outside,  1 more inside.  Then someone started the event.  2 more there.  And one more on the way back to the train station.    2 of the 5 legendaries were 2 stars.
---
It doesn't do any damage .
---
Farmed 7 large, 15 normal and 32 small. No santa 😕
---
I'm going by the last sentence, I'm just saying for someone to feel that way and then type it kinda sad with a high percentage of cringe and it's funny to think someone older than a teen-ager types like that.
---
I think I've seen this happen before, but I also think you still need to nuke the site at first, but the other nukes don't have to affect the site.
---
I still hope that someone can confirm that nuking somewhere else can still summon the SBQ, even with the first nuke.
---
Well yeah I figured, I just assumed it having a different texture meant something, like cut content or future content.
---
I've had that happen, going into the social tab usually fixes it, at least on PC
---
I was initially confused as well.  The gift that you buy from the atomic shop is just a skin for the loot or death bags.  But the robovendors at train stations sell wrapping paper, which is what allows you to craft gifts for yourself.
---
8 looked it up. Aparanrly it goes back to 1978 in MUD1. It was in the code for the enemies. Short for Mobile.
---
Neat stuff. I hadn't heard the term before Minecraft but I also avoided Evercrack like the plague back in the day.
---
Yea guessing you server hopped instead joining the same one 
---
Complete Brutal honesty, your fault.
---
1- it's not supported by game mechanics and therefore not bethesdas fault you "burned" yourself 
---
2- why are you transferring serums and ultracite power armor to a lvl 15? Especially one so young she hasn't even learned the controls? 
---
3- your wife had to stop you from cracking the disc? Jesus I feel bad for your daughter having to grow up with a childish emotionally unstable father like you, cant wait to see the caliber of guys her daddy issues inspired milk shake brings to the yard...or well that lil patch of weeds in between the trailers that you people call a yard
---
Sounds like a vent/gripe, and it seems like that is a big part of Reddit.  A vent or gripe a lot of times leads to an answer or solution, or, just some other folks sharing their setbacks as a form of consolation.  That said, I don't understand the suggestion that it is a kid and such.  Seems like a pretty normal series of events and emotions for a patent.
---
Oh, wow. There go my caps. Thanks for the info!
---
It was a private server I launched it on. No other nuke zone was there.
---
That’s a good point, I never thought of reloading Class Freak. I don’t know why but I’m terrified to do that. I got the 3 mutations I wanted in 3 server hops in a row by standing in a river taking rad damage! That will never happen again.
---
I launch both from the .exe.
---
You are the best! Thank you!!!
---
Well, since my MUDding doesn't go back that far, that's news to me ;-)  I'm surprised they were around that far back, there wasn't much of an internet back then.
---
I think I started in about '92 or '93 now that I think about it, so I can personally verify that it's at least that old.
---
There is no doubt that what you say is true. The problem really lies in the fact that Bethesda regularly produces sub-standard work. A  new player may be enticed to purchase the game based on lower level play, but they should be aware of the dumpster fire that the game can quite often become. I really like the game and have a 1 year fallout first subscription but I have no illusions about the next major screw up is just around the corner.
---
The one you want is Ninja. 
---
Mr Sandman and Covert Ops are both ranged weapon specific.  And Mr Sandman requires a suppressor to be added to the weapon.
---
Yep it was noted since the last patch.
---
Good to know. I was going to try NW again after a month of Modern Warfare, but if those folks are still around best avoid the rage and not bother.
---
I joined a queen fight last week where the nuke had missed the fissure site. It was close to it. 
---
So there might be something to this idea.
---
Because fun.
---
It is a great cap sink.
---
To be honest, I'm quite enjoying the lack of text-chat and related issues. The game is IMO better without a WoW-like local and global chats. But the game could use some limited "broadcast message system". Probably consisting of of predefined messages that can be only sent using the CAMP terminal. Something like "I've opened my shot, come look at it", "Who want's to group up for adventure", "I'm going to the Project Paradise event. Join me if you can". Basically messages that will help coordinate player activities without explicitely allowing players to spam non-immersive messages. This solution would also solve the basic reason for not having a text chat - consoles. With the predefined messages you don't need to type, only select an entry on a terminal...
---
Yeah
---
Got it on both my characters today. Wasn’t really looking for it. I don’t ever craft or use grenades.
---
Yea it can get pretty annoying. 
---
Until they fix it, I have found that you can get away with placing a lot of objects simply by moving them very slightly within the green area and spamming your place button. Eventually you can find a spot that just happens to let you place. 
---
I may not get the exact position I want, but I would say about 80% of the time I can get an acceptable placement for the item. This way I basically bypass the bug.
---
You heard the scorched?
---
In my experience the biggest problem is power connection wierdness.  I'm guessing it's having a hard time calculating if a power pull is good or not.
---
I've shifted to doing bluprints, plus I slice the blueprint such that no power connections leave or enter.  Once I started doing that, my problems went away.
---
The hardest part is snapping together different layers of a blueprint. For that one, I've found it helps to make things more jigsaw shaped.  So leave a section of floor or wall indented or outdented, and it snaps together better.
---
class freak only reduces the negative effect of mutations, you're probably thinking of starched genes
---
alright, but what armor is the best in terms of wood/robot/etc? the marine i have is good but even tho it says 50% more durable it breaks before anything else smh
---
Get a dedicated team or play solo. 
---
I absolutley love NW because of my team of 3, we work well together, we know each others strengths and weaknesses and we make up for what one another lacks. We average 2-3 wins on a bad night, but the goal of NW isn't to win, really, it's to survive, hence the people hiding in bushes. 
---
Dunno, I have a really good time on it. I'm not on PC though, so I can imagine PC players frustrations considering the straight up cheating. I know people exploit bugs on console too, but not to that extent.
---
They are fairly incompetent,
---
Nice .. where is that location ?
---
Whoops, slip of the mind, you’re right.
---
It goes back to the late 70s for MUDs who shortened it like that.
---
The corollary is removing a stair. I have quit builds where I place a stair and want to move it. The stair is connected only at the foundation. No upper floor, nothing, but it can't be moved because the invisible,  not there floor won't have support. It's infuriating.
---
just saw a guy name (toyz7) in my game ...yeah he won the game take it hes a hacker?
---
Lol way older than that.  Try the late 70s and MUDs.
---
I've been waiting and they finally do it and then roll it back cause they broke armor. Like seriously.
---
This
---
Yeah, the community is one of the saving graces of the game. Meeting people ingame is almost always a positive experience. Even waving at each other and then going our own ways always makes the play session better.
---
We don't have so many assholes because the "cool kids" don't want to lose their street cred by playing a game with bed reputation. For many of the toxic players out there it's important to play the popular games because it makes them feel more relevant...
---
That bug is back again? 😂
---
Did the event probably 10 times yesterday. I got at least on legendary per event, sometimes two. I was by myself for 5 events, and was joined with some randoms for the other 5. Never had a no spawn event, but I did get one that spawned a legendary but didn't give a gift...
---
Water filter
---
Ok so they are aware of it at least. Good to know.
---
This! Got three of them out of one Line In The Sand last night.
---
I haven't tried this, but could you use someone's collectron storage to store stuff? A lot of people should now have a santatron in their camps.
---
This sounds normal for me on PC. The game crashes like crazy as of a few months ago.
---
Basically the map layout Prime spots for loot
---
BOS combat armor. If you are rich you can go for scout modded one for limbs.
---
Got 3 to spawn during a SBQ fight last night, all small gifts. Did Glassed Cavern right after (with about 5 other random people) and only was able to tag one legendary and it was a large gift. So, it's still pretty random.
---
I regret I only have 1 upvote to give.  Thank you so much for putting this together.
---
Interesting. I assume you were going for violet flux?
---
Cool dude k.... fucking ass. I was asking for a squad. Umm to, ya know show me the ropes. Your just another reddit cunt. Sorry, in a bad mood.
---
You wont, Ive been swimming under point pleasant, lol
---
Any future dlc or patch should be called ‘missed opportunities’.
---
It was going to get a comeback like Star Wars Battlefront II (Dice/EA) and then the Fridge happened. And as this wasn't enough Fallout 1st came. I'm completely disappointed and won't trust them ever again. They lied to us to much

Not the brightest idea to pay a lot of money for something not everyone will welcome.
---
Yea I plopped my tent outside of the big bend tunnel so I’m going to make that the center of my   route from now on
---
It was like a silent patch sort of thing. I’m on PS4 and I got no update either, I tested it yesterday and it was perfectly fine now.
---
True. I got a 3 star from Morgantown Airport last night, it dropped me a 3 star unyielding robot arm with 20% less junk weight and was level 1. I might actually use it on my alt.
---
Ahh that happened to me earlier. Could look at the map but not could not move.
---
Send tick pics
---
I crash like crazy on PC. It has nothing to do with Xbox Gold, or Xbox at all. The game is an unstable mess.
---
You know, i would agree to reduce active players per server to 25-27, if it could resolve budget size problem.
---
A lv30 bloodid Gamma gun good?
---
Uses more ammo
---
Bethesda told me no
---
If you have a pump Action shotty that  does 8 shots typically it now holds 32. It basically quadruples the ammo capacity
---
Crimson actually. The trenches are a good place to find it.
---
If you’re smart, you’d build your base so it doesn’t do that.
---
Yea I don’t understand how they can’t sort this out! It works while crouched so why can’t they fix it!? I got a GREAT anti armor explosive fixer with drwa and this directly effects the trade value of this weapon! HOWEVER I would rather have my unyielding back than this for now because the armor bug was absolutely a game ruiner!
---
Are you just a bandwagoner or is there a specific event that hurt your feelings?
---
If ur not playing anymore gimme ur shit ahhh
---
i stay at 30k caps so i figured might as well try to find the best armor cause i can't even sell anything. weapon wise/material &amp; whatnot i already have, so thanks
---
See ya later, alligator.
---
Your a fuckin tool boss. My guy just wanted to give some shit to his kid to enjoy.  No reason to talk shit. If you havent wanted to smash somethin cuz your game pissed you off..do you even video game? 
---
I feel it. I have a few mules..and 1st. I dump everything on my main in a case..and log in with whichevet mule i need to pick up certain things. After 2 went a ok..my third mule logged in to same server..and behold..not my private server..and the cade was empty. My claimed workshops were not claimed.. Luckily i just ended up losin a bunch of aid and not my weapons. 
---
This guys little girl is gonna grow up and be president. Any father who does anything with their kid is fantastic. Some kids play baseball..some kids play video games..if shes interested in video games to be like daddy? Hell yes. Asshat.
---
Gives you the clipazine amount multiplied by 4. Say you have 4 shots, the quad effect will make you have 16 shots. You use no more or less ammo than you do already, just reload less.
---
Same. Im playing only using pipe weapons, no purified water, no fusion generator, and only wood walls or tent for my camp. For that more living off the land, scavenger type of feel. Oh yea and my character only wearing those old, patched up dirty outfits you find in game.
---
What is the replica grog axe? What does it do!?
---
Actually that one looks pretty decent :)
---
It has me re-exploring places I have not been to in 100 levels.  I do miss the group aspect of it that Mischief night and Meat week had.
---
Not every game will be everyones cup of tea. Gl and hope you find one that does scratch your itch.
---
Has anyone found any of the Holiday Scorched?
---
Take my upvote you creative bastard.
---
PC?
---
well it is a bit of both. the \*\*\* whisper in the dark was one of my favorite legionaries and was sad to lose. I could have botched the transfer, but I honestly dont know how. it worked last month. also with the recent patch I didn't know is anyone else had seen an issue.
---
Ps4
---
Nah never played beta.
---
I dont think you're able to start the game without the right game version, or at least it wont log you in, and giving you an error
---
The game will not work until it is up to date and yes it will tell you you need to update.
---
If you're talking about the orange camo looking one, that's been revealed as a fallout 1st reward.
---
Yeah I came here to suggest tweeting them with your ticket number and asking if they can give you a response.
---
Line in the Sand has spawned at least 2 every time I join. Maybe that will bring more luck!
---
Have you checked weapon levels?
---
Looks like the best spot to me, only that the cave is really laggy for me somehow makes it difficult.
---
Honestly, OW was way over hyped. It's fun, and it's a good game for what it is, but it's far from the New Vegas love child it was made out to be.
---
I would enjoy leaving a message on someones terminal! Almost like sending an email i thought it would make the most sense and a slower paced chat style.
---
ITS BAAAAACK!!!
---
I hated the lockup on login bug.  I was hoping it was gone forever. 
---
What used to work was if you crouch upon login, it would typically stabilize a bit faster.  
---
Since I am always sneaking, this is second nature now, but some people who dont use a sneak build, or newer players who wernt around for the first iteration of this issue may not know this yet.
---
Try doing a crouch when you login now.  Then give it a few seconds before you try to open the map or  the pipboy.
---
They definitely upped the rate of them when patch 16 hit, before the event started.  After not seeing a legendary scorched in months, I ran into 2 within fifteen minutes of each other on Wednesday. One of them just spawned right outside my camp.  Either just really weird rng or they upped it in prep for the event.  They could just end up nerfing it once the event ends though I guess.
---
That's my issue too!!!! 😬
---
So this community is nice thing is a myth that does not deserve to be perpetuated. There are a ton of assholes playing this game too.
---
Some of the community is nice and deserves to be recognized, but not even close to everyone.
---
i got the feeling that somebody's watching me ;p ye its some kind of chester folower
---
Saw this happen yesterday. Buddy launched a nuke clearly not hitting FS prime and the Queen still showed up.
---
I've seen people miss it several times in a row, only by 1/8" or so on the map screen, but it still triggered her, but I've also seen people nuke Watoga and not trigger SBQ. I'm guessing you just have to hit the Event Area with the nuke, that larger imaginary border where the game determines that you're leaving or joining an Event
---
Yep, all the same, 45 and 50's, with some weapons capping at 45.
---
The dailies at dolly sods and kid corner aye
---
I found out last night that Poseidon Power Plant spawns a bunch of them. I got 10 in one run.
---
If you have "Team Only" activated for a private world then you have to invite your friends onto your team from the main menu before you or them can go into the private world (Which is what we did) but even after he's part of my team the game kicks him from the private world after 2 or 3 mins.
---
If you have "All Friends" activated for a private world then anyone on your friends list can join the world. That mode is working fine. 
---
The issue seems to be with "Team Only" worlds. Bethesda seems to be aware of the issue though so hopefully its fixed quickly.
---
Trying to shoot all the bugs inflicted with this game.
---
With the team only vs all friends for private worlds, the way I read this is that If you are already in your private world and you see a friend is online, you have to leave your world and go public, team with them and then go back to private, losing workshops you already claimed if you are set to team only ?  
---
If that’s the case, that’s really silly. We should be able to invite them on to the team and into the world without leaving the world.
---
I tried stings and things on Tuesday and didn't get a possum badge. I haven't tried it again since
---
Yes, they do.   
---
If you're seriously suggesting that a first party provider just lets developers release unapproved, untested code to their multi-billion dollar hardware platform without any kind of certification process, just because a dev wants it out quickly, you're off your fucking rocker mate.
---
Aren’t gamma guns in the 5’s?
---
I think I saw a post fairly recently where someone said they placed their power armor down, not dropping it, and it disappeared.  Could be a rare glitch where everything has to be just so.....lord knows they have their bugs.
---
Sunny Top Ski lanes - Base Lodge
---
It doesn’t use more ammo why would you say that?
---
This isnt just a recent problem. I've had friends that couldnt join my server before the update. Last night we all tried using the friends setting and none of us could join the others' private server.
---
Say that to Bethesda, they still make games like it's 2002.
---
Yeah I tested that also to see if maybe it made a difference, when unequipped, minigun is 78 dmg, when equipped its 109, same as the Two shot version I have, not sure why they are the same damage when Two shot is only 25% damage..  
---
Both weapons have the same upgrades too, same levels etc
---
I understand some people are using exploits, but some people are just really good at killing other players. I remember playing CoD back in the day and getting accused of hacking if I had a good match. People HATE to admit that there are players that will always be better than them.
---
This wouldn't match with any of the lore. There is only one BOS group on the east coast at this point in time, and there are no confirmed survivors from that group. Contact between the origin BOS and the Taggerdy's Thunder BOS has been lost, and no further means of communication between the origin BOS and any other detached group exists.
---
And my axe!
---
That suit is nice! The rest I couldn't care less about, haha.
---
There were two other bundle stuff that showed up. I wonder what they are
---
You can launch but you cannot play.
---
Yeah, they were probably losing too many 1sters.
---
Ah. Harper's Ferry is another good spot for that. There is quite a lot to the west of the town around the swamp areas as well as some at the farm on the hill.
---
Got loads of stuff with the same drop rate as that damn plasma plan, but that’s the only thing I want!
---
Same here. I'll run around and shoot occasionally, but as a fully introverted lone wanderer of the wasteland, I would rather ignore other humans, and I choose to not have the team auto fill. I think a lot of the base of Fallout fans would prefer not to play with others, but want to get the rewards that require it to be done.
---
I can see how using an exaggeration for dramatic effect can mislead drastically. cracking the disk was my conversation with my wife. frustration with this buggy game I have been playing for a year now. also losing one of my favorite \*\*\* legionaries.   ...motive with no intent.
---
dont give a shit about what you think of me. talking crap about my kid, wow your classy.
---
sure I could have messed up, ive only transferred stuff 3 times before. also with the recent patch I didn't know if its a new game bug.
---
the ultracite was to be sold. the serums, dunno... Im not really playing for my interest anymore.
---
I also get terrible lag and tons of screen tearing here. The only other location that does this to me is the building with all the lights/instruments at the Sons of Dane compound.
---
I wish they would change the misleading text on the Chemist card.
---
Nuka cola armor paint in the last picture.
---
Have any been spotted in interior cells? So far I've only seen out in the world and in buildings.
---
Carnivore doesn't work with Cannibal for the 2x food bonus or eliminating rads. Lead Belly does, though, I like to use rank 2 or 3 of Lead Belly and rank 1 Cannibal and just drink from streams and eat bodies. It saves so much weight and time fucking around in the pipboy only to have the game freeze cuz you clicked on some purified water lol
---
Thanks for all the replies everyone. Playing with others sounds like a great idea but none of my friends still play on PC. I down for making new friends. I'm 46 and a Dad to two young children, so my playtime is sporadic, but if you'd like to hang out in game, please let me know.
---
Thats awesome lol anytime i go over the amounts i want to hold on junk, gunpowder or chems i just find the nearest player and give them all of my extras, which is sometimes just steel, plastic and gunpowder but sometimes i have like 50 stimpacks on my person so ill drop 25 on someone, just depends lol
---
&gt; Queen fights are a horrible mess 
---
Not noticed that at all.
---
&gt;private servers with noone else in the game I get non stop stuttering/frame drops and blue screens 
---
This sounds like it may be your end, system or conifg?
---
&gt; and Ive done 6 queen fights in the last few days, and each one was almost impossible to even move as the game was dropping frames so bad. 
---
Done more than that and smooth as butter, huge crowds and everyone got a lot drop plus the ads.
---
Best drop 60k or so while I can still get double, I doubt it’s intended.
---
Also I think this is literally the first time that I’ve known Bethesda to fix something in a reasonablish time frame, not that they should’ve fucked it up to begin with.
---
You're venting for your own benefit when the OP needs help. That's irrelevant and unhelpful here. This isn't a random crash, it's a consistent, repeatable occurrence.
---
Because he's on Xbox, and because it seems to be happening when he signs in, it could be related to an error when signing in to his Xbox Gold account. Being an online game, 76 will crash if it fails to connect or stay connected to your account.
---
Ye, well he wasn't wearing a santa costume but I asked him if he'd trade a few items for a jetpack I wanted but couldn't afford the caps. Dude, sold it to me for 1 cap. I is hella grateful for that cat
---
Been farming Valley Galleria, got 4 in that on location, Harper's can be good as well, and palace of the winding path. :)
---
lol
---
Increased perception and more ap for vats
---
The increase in perception will make you more accurate in vats.
---
Eat shit asshat
---
Better vats accuracy due to perception special increase and more action points for vats due to increased agility are a couple.
---
I’ve been dropping sets of low level deep pocketed heavy leather armour, full sets of fully modded level 15 power armour with spare full cores, modded handmades etc. If I get low level decent legendaries I drop those for new players too. It’s part of the fun of the game for me.
---
I assume your Bethesda thank you was sarcastic. These problems have persisted for a year, if they could have/wanted to fix them, they would have.
---
Better perception is accuracy
---
Better agi is action pts and stealth
---
Better int is XP and crap nobody really cares about
---
Better luck is vats crits and crap nobody really cares about
---
Less useful:
---
Better Str let’s you roll to 1 Str (or 3 if you take blocker) and avoid carry weight perks
---
Better Charisma is prices and in theory rewards and sharing better perks but that part has been squirrelly 
---
So In essence unyielding can be good for any build.  I have a vats sniper and switch between it and weightless, both are very viable.
---
I agree bro, backflip man didnt sunset himself
---
Fallout 76 is just stressful all around.
---
I paid a guy 5k caps plus his caps back to come to my workshop get wanted and allow me to kill him 76 times
---
Nice catch
---
Lol. Now that’s dedication! Mine are all ‘authentic’ :)
---
HA! good joke saying the Queen fights were smooth!
---
All the other people on my teams over the last few days have commented on it, they noticed when they are alone or on a team, in private of in public, so that is at least 13 people who are also experiencing it on ps4
---
there is no :config: for the ps4
---
i already said i have gig fiber hardwired into the ps4, NO other game i play online has any issues
---
Yeah I took every workshop and placed a santatron at each and played for a few hours then checked them all and got nothing besides an ass load of boxing gloves...
---
There's stuff online dude
---
I had one spawn in the big bend tunnel (not one of the pre-existing groups, he and 3 other scorched spawned in when I got to an area). They also spawn in the glassed cavern, had two there.
---
I don't think they ever spawn as the semi-petrified ones, only the already-alert ones.
---
Sounds like you loaded in to a new server somehow. Especially if you were using the locked containers. It's obviously very screwy.
---
I had 3 people swear up and down to me that just dropping it in a bag would work and then I lost about 3 days worth of scrip, a shitton of ammo, and a nice FE fr 50cal. That burnt me pretty good and since then like I said I haven't even tried the container method. I'd rather pay somebody I trust off here.
---
Nope. I'm seeing issues with the all friends option as well. None of my friends could join my server and I couldnt join theirs. Get the "cant join because you aren't friends with this person" error message. Sometimes it boots and gloves this message a minute or so after they join. I've actually been seeing this issue since before the patch.
---
I did the same thing..i bought a month on november 6th...i still have private worlds and scrapbox. I didnt get anymore atoms but it didnt stop me from using the private worlds. Fuciin clutch for farming these jingly scorched bastards
---
Only useful if you run VATS and you don't mind dying.
---
The 2 shot have any other effects like explosive that the junkies doesn't?
---
Ahhh I understand.  I've been kind of a power junkie the entire time so I just swap out regular armor pieces whenever I get one with better stats on it or a better legendary effect for when I want to be stealthy.  I actually wasn't aware that there was an effect for increasing your carry weight.  Thanks!
---
Ah, Damn, Didn't know it was effecting both modes. I've personally never had issues with the "All Friends" mode. That sucks. Really hope Bethesda gets on top of this.
---
I’m not fully sure but there is a new option when you inspect someone in friends list
---
Been getting alot of low level chameleon and unyielding armor and have been dropping it to low LVL players.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
You're wrong here. The game is unstable on every platform, it's a well documented issue. You're the one in denial here. 
---
Driving the OP crazy thinking the issue is somehow his console or Xbox membership is unhelpful.
---
Reminds me about dropping an item in fo4 then storing it let you build 1 item if you were at max budget.
---
If you're on discord, there's a link in there to a plan collecting group. We do a lot of trading and everyone is trying to make sure everyone else gets what they need from this event.
---
I’m not. Don’t understand discord - how does it work?
---
It's the regular melee weapon. Previously the plan wasn't obtainable by legitimate means. The actual axe drops very rarely in the game as legendary. This just allows you to craft it now.
---
\*not part of the bundle tho
---
Its more worrying it took this long, then got pushed back to who knows when, without even looking at other issues.
---
Great news I was afraid they would patch that.  This is turning out to be a good event. I have hope for faschnacht parade now.
---
When you equip a junkies weapon the buff applies to all weapons even non Junkies weapons and grenades
---
It's a gaming chat platform. Download and install it from [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com). Then click on that link in the spreadsheet and it will give you access to the server. Then there are many channels in that server for talking about the different types of plans...weapons, armor, recipes, etc.  There will be a lot of people willing to help you learn to use discord as well as complete your plan collection.
---
I've genuinely made the game half helping new players and half farming legendaries/atom challenges. [My Bar](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e9v0ou/finally_finished_my_bar_vaultdwellers/) is real close to Vault 76, I always leave at the very least a few purified water in a drop bag (Christmas present drops bags are great!), sometimes a little more. If I am looking at heading back to CAMP and see a low level, I'll drop some stimpaks, Radaway and Rad-X...if they wanna stick around I love making some leather deep pocketed, a decent weapon or two and dropping ammo too. I've ran a few through Morgantown airport for small backpacks and such as well. It's a real blast helping new players out...and if they have a mic it's like a weirdly fun version of the FO4 companion that you get to have for a short time!
---
Is it voice chat or text chat?
---
Hello  I am interested since am just missing the plasma mine and mutant hound head
---
It would help if we'd get experience for helping our team win even if we die, so long as we stay in the game till it ends, but we don't so most don't even try.
---
You got 15 shots. lucky.
---
How do you claim them once you link accounts?
---
Just Two shot Minigun and Gatling Laser/Plasma  
---
The Junkies is just junkies too, even before i obtained the Junkies weapon, the minigun was still 109 damage (Two shot version) so not sure why the Junkies minigun isnt seeing a higher output of damage..
---
Yeah, when I look at my minigun (Two Shot) it gains like 198 dmg for some reason whenever I have a Junkies item equipped lol
---
It will increase your perception, agility and luck, which are the 3 main special stats for a rifles build (commando and rifleman work off the same skillset)
---
Unyeilding will help with your vats accuracy, vats refresh, AP refresh, AP use, and crit meter fill.  All which are vital to maximizing DPS for rifles.
---
Yea I was just wondering why it was called “replica” instead of just grognak axe but it actually makes sense since it was grognak the barbarians axe, the one you would craft would be a mere replica in comparison. That’s a cool detail and I guess I never thought about crafting them since there are no mods. Yet I still need to learn it!
---
nice PSA. thanks.
---
I kind of buy that idea, but give me that as an holotape please.
---
Does the level of the Scorched determine the tier of gift they drop? Been getting mostly small gifts but Ive been doing mainly Forest runs...
---
Thsts just a display bug
---
It's not an event, they just added the holiday themed scorched to the world so you can drop in and farm them when you feel like it.
---
This always happens when a lot of players pick up the game again. It must be the back end servers that can't handle the traffic. When the player base drop again. It magically gets better again with no client patch.
---
Metal is really good for melee as well. Since you'll be up close and personal with most things, the DR is king and metal gets the highest of all of them. But forget it for PvP because you'll get destroyed by Teslas (though you probably don't want to do PvP melee anyway). Metal also has a benefit of not needing ballistics fiber to repair (though you need screws instead which are easier to farm, but still annoying).
---
Basically Scout with Polymer and BOS Combat Heavy are about the same with BOS having a slight advantage for ER. Both will have you farming ballistics fiber. Polished Metal has more DR than anything else, but low ER and Leather has really high ER, but low DR. If you're not going to be going on trade boards to buy full sets, you most likely will just focus on the legendary effects and choose what you find. I've got an almost full Vanguards set that is a mix of Combat and Scout and works pretty nicely and has poison resistance on a couple so I can do raids and not get wrecked by Mirelurk queens. I was trying for a matching set, but gave up because the legendary effects are way more important than the base as long as its heavy and either combat, metal or scout.
---
This post is really handy, I've got it favorited as I refer back to it when checking armor out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/df2tim/complete\_armor\_stat\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/df2tim/complete_armor_stat_guide/)
---
this happens on my mules as well....  wth?
---
I just want weekly rewards to stop autocompleting without a payout when I go into Nuclear Winter.
---
I mean come ON, I shouldn't have to choose to either for path of enlightenment to start so I can get 40 Atoms OR play Nuclear Winter on a Wednesday, They are not mutually exclusive options!
---
You can actually go and claim this now.
---
If you have Amazon Prime, you also have Twitch Prime.  You just need to link your Twitch and Bethesda accounts.
---
Either. Mostly text, but you can do voice if you want as well. You're in full control.
---
You can place them at workshops ?!
---
Ah text is perfect, ok will join when I get on later
---
But sometimes it's easier than Combat because a few of the best combat armor plans are a real pain to get and you can just go to Whitesprings to buy any mod for scout armor you want.
---
So, it was fixed.....
---
Add a second person to the "look stupid" pile.
---
I don't think so. I've been all over the map. I get mostly small but a Holiday &amp; Large one drop a few times as well. Think its randomly generated regardless of lvl
---
Weird I can see the notes on the ground in front of the door of the pawn shop but no option to pick them up or read them.  Just the ones on the table.
---
Yea mine as well....pretty annoying. I've just left "Team Only" alone until its fixed
---
Well it might be better to open them and sell the plans. I saw someone pay 10k for the mega sloth plan yesterday!!!
---
Magazine*
---
I submitted a ticket for challenges be completed when I logged in. They responded after a few hours, and credited me 80 atoms for my troubles the next day. Super quick response time. And it didn't cost me a monthly subscription.
---
Thanks for the replies and upvotes. I went to make a Twitter a couple minutes ago and when I checked my email for the Twitter code customer support had reached out. They refunded me and offered an apology. So this worked. Thank y’all so much.
---
If you leave the pawn shop and re enter you can loot all the junk over and over...not sure if it’s supposed to do that.
---
Tbh I think it is intentional, it would explain ahy it’s under aid and not mics of junk and off the top of my head no other perk actually gives you guaranteed double when crafting 1.7k is a lot of caps for 1 gift so a way to get a better benefit would be viable
---
Everyone knows Santatron doesn't deliver gifts till Christmas Eve night.
---
But "degrees of awful" are the entire *reason* for a ranking system like "worst business practice." Equating 76 with No Man's Sky not only makes Bethesda look worse then they are (which I'm okay with, honestly) it lets CIG off the hook, making their frankly illegal scam seem less awful than it actually is.
---
I have a bloodied FFR gamma gun.  It’s sneaky good especially for some PvP battles
---
Can't link, twitch account continue to disappear from Linked Accounts on Bethesda site, linking shows only for 1 secound
---
I think this is the actual answer. I've triggered it without actually hitting prime, but I doubt you'd get it to go if you nuked General's Steakhouse or For Defiance (though now I want to try)
---
I have several quad weapons.  My favorite is quad combat rifle with FFR and reload speed.   80 shots!!
---
Hmm, never really encountered these problems, but when i feel things are acting up i restart my internet and console. Not an IT guy, but that pretty much fixes any issues im having.
---
Well, that'll teach me to try to answer someone's question.
---
This post is a big time Cap saver. Even with the travel perk  I swear I spent 1K caps yesterday traveling around from place to place lol
---
Yea but they re broke the damage resistance while aiming! Lol
---
What happens to your current camp in the open world?
---
I was running on a private server last night collecting fusion cores at power plants. Every power plant had 2-3 legendary scorched.
---
Neat.
---
There are a lot of areas in the toxic valley that don't provide much cover. That said Wavy Willards would be a fun spot to fight.
---
I agree. They definitely upped it. Because I haven't had this much script scrapped in the longest.
---
Capture the Flag would be awesome.  The game mode that defines online PVP.  Every other multiplayer shooter has this game mode, because its the crowd favorite. 
---
While the team deathmatch battle royal option we have is fun and all, a Capture the flag(or base) addition to Nuclear Winter could revitalize the game mode. 
---
Maybe add in a randomizer for game types when the match is started.  The orignal version, a 25vs25 deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and maybe something akin to Halo's Deadball.
---
Yeet welcome to hell.
---
From what I've read on this game thus far, this seems to be Bethesda's solution to bugs too.
---
Is it weird that I'm looking forward to it?
---
I did get a couple of 500 cap paybacks
---
Sorry he didn't send pics I'll try to get them he had to jump to look
---
nope, its actually a really fun game.
---
Its a lot of fun i burn maybe 7 to 9 hrs a day playing if you get past all the bull shit your good.
---
Are these leftovers from the FO4 or functional FO76 mannequins?
---
In my experience the fast travel seems to be better. The glitch was fast travel would just fail to work sometimes even if there was no enemies around. That, at least in my experience so far seems to be fixed. What is not fixed, which I believe is the intended mechanism is that if there is an enemy nearby it gives you the fast travel countdown and if the enemy hits you or you hit the enemy during the countdown the fast travel aborts. This is most likely to prevent everyone just fast traveling away from combat that they are losing much like you can't fast travel if you're falling off a cliff (which can be a pain if you glitch into a wall and get stuck in an endless falling cycle).
---
Yup, then when you find only place you can put it's....       ....Floating. Urgh.
---
Trying to get them friends been afk for a while
---
Hmmmm I don’t think I’ve ever tried it on a normal enemy. I got a level 15 quad off of a scorched last night tho so that was cool
---
Yeah, it's like that armor not taking damage bug they fixed a couple patches ago. They could have left that one in and no one would have cared lol. Now we all have to repair our armor every five minutes.
---
No it was a dev room item. Like 3 of the plans from this event are dev room.
---
Can confirm, they're like Scorchbeast bodies that follow you around the map.  Been around for a while now.  Sucks when these appear in front of your vendors but the good thing is they're only there for you, other players won't see or even know they're there.
---
Have not really encountered any of these but that def sounds frustrating.
---
Remember reading a topic awhile ago where some said that all the gatling lasers and gatling plasma create lag at events like sqb/imposter. 
---
Im not tech savy enough to know if its true but it does make a certain sense. Get a few ppl using them cluttering the screen with laser beams along with everything else going on sounds like it could add more stress for game to keep up.
---
This game is super fun if you give it a chance
---
FYI, you don't need to be in a party for that achievement. Just follow a low-level character around, and revive them when they inevitably get mobbed. It's what I did (a level 17 vs a Scorchbeast is not a pretty sight...)
---
Well, i have a microphone, and anxiety, but its still not gonna solve the issue if the other player(s) don't have one
---
haven't played this game in months, I would't know.
---
It is the exact same thing but they don't drop out of the sky.
---
the max player count is 24...
---
It drives me nuts went to moth town or whatever its called killed everything and the jingels woudent stop found out that dick got buged in a closed building....
---
That's what I'm banking on. Despite all the mass fuckery surrounding it.
---
I just ignore the BS, and if there is a bug, I play around it, or try new (or old) things. 
---
This week I had a ton of fun going back to my old full health PA build.  Power armor effects wernt impacted by the reload bug, so it was just like old times.
---
there is so much to do in this game that even if something gets buggy, there is something else to do so you dont have to deal with it.
---
First thing I checked.
---
I like to separate the people who make games and the games themselves. So all of this Bethesda greed doesn't effect my experience.
---
Just in case you didn't know that. With ''ally'' they mean ''just revive someone that is dead''.
---
Yea crops are a real issue they take up so much budget its unbelievable
---
Please point out where I denied that the game was unstable. I don't believe I did. I believe what I said was that this particular issue isn't random. If it's not random, then it might be something we can solve. Simply stating that the game is inherently unstable isn't a solution and isn't relevant. I proposed a solution. It might be the wrong solution, but that's how you start the troubleshooting process.
---
Whenever I see Scorched Hord and travel to ot I can never find them, end eventually the event gets completed. How do you actually find them?
---
Been a huge Bethesda fan ever since Morrowind which is still my favorite game to date. But MAN they took a turn with this one. But, it's Fallout. And, it was $13.
---
The original purchase is just a fling. Turn this into a proper lasting relationship and commit to a Fallout 1st subscription.
---
The programing certainly sucks, but so much love and attention to detail went into the world building of this game.
---
Pc had a mod that adds a sight I'm pretty sure
---
Can someone explain how I claim it please. I already have a Twitch account and it’s linked but can’t see anything.
---
Belching Petty - great band name
---
Yeah this was a pretty bad turn. But it's still enjoyable. Have fun with it!
---
1st member here. Something is weird with camp budget recently; I took a gun off the wall display at my CAMP and gave it to a friend. Couldn’t put a new gun up in its place, because “the camp budget has been exceeded”. 
---
Now I always run at the limit and haven’t changed anything since I first built my Collectron. So something is now taking up more space than it used to.
---
Toxic valley would be fun for snipers though
---
I've learned over time that crazy hoes are best kept to the bedroom, not marriage.
---
Demarches would be fun.
---
It sure did, however even after numerous patches and updates I can still say that the attention could have been used to smoothen some other aspects of the game.. Even if some of them are fine now.
---
Meh, nothing world shaking.
---
It never had a chance to be viable, and it's okay. They should replace it by an easier effect. Something like "25% chance to fully reload instantly" or even something new.
---
Awesome way of looking at it. At this point, I'm almost excited for the bugs. Steered clear of this monstrosity at launch(as I do with pretty much everything) but after a year of following the fixes accompanied by more breaks, it's become comical enough for me to jump in.
---
Is legendary weapon condition fixed? I had to stop using my explosive combat shotgun cause it would break after 5 mags
---
Yep. It's one of the more unsettling bugs I've encountered.
---
I might actually play Nuclear Winter if it had some of these modes. I like things like Hardpoint or some of the other modes in Black Ops that encourage you to work together or play differently than just hide in a corner and snipe everything that moves.
---
Overall it is great. Sure, you'll get frustrated at times, but honestly, it doesn't Hurt to go to bed at a reasonable time once or twice a week.
---
Serums.
---
An RPG isn't solely defined by the idea that what you do feels like it has consequences, nor does it require dialogue. 
---
You want it to be more like other RPGs. That's fine. That still doesn't make it not an RPG. 
---
You reference games like Elder Scrolls and Mass effect. Elder scrolls has nearly, especially with Skyrim, turned into an adventure game with RPG elements. Mass effect went from a Dialogue simulator to an basically a shooter RPG....
---
There's a wide array of "RPGs" from old school nes/snes era JRPGs like FF and the Mana series to stuff like Baldur's Gate and Mass effect. 
---
Once 76 was announced, who actually expected it to be a traditional ROG experience? I sure didn't. They sure didn't tout it as one. That's an issue with expectations and nothing else. 
---
And even if it's not a classic RPG, why does that matter? It's going to be an evolving online survival lite/adventure/shooter/rpg?
---
Why is that bad? Why does it have to retread the footsteps of 8373646 RPGs before it? 
---
Complaining that it's not a classic RPG (which it was never advertised as) is like being upset that Lacrosse isn't hockey because you hear there were sticks, nets, a goalie, physical contact, similar equipment.....
---
they're totally missing out on a huge market with pvp.
---
Yes, it’s happened for me too!
---
Or imagine if they had some co-op maps with waves of ghouls and other baddies like CoD Zombies.
---
I once found two Santa scorched in the big bend tunnel
---
I don't like the Battle Royale type of gameplay but Capture the Flag was amazing back in the days when shooter games offered it. I would enjoy playing that rather than the NW.
---
Yeah they fixed it with the update.
---
Log out, sign back in. There’s no pop up or anything but you can see them as owned in the atom shop.
---
Weird. I just bought a month a few days ago. Got it instantly.
---
Shove it in the santatron box
---
So Bethesda's graduated from incompetence to garden variety theft, I see. Lovely :\\
---
Thanks I will try that.
---
Still cool
---
Gotcha, I'm not sure then sounds odd.  In any event though your junkies minigun will have a lot better accuracy so at least there's that.  
---
Try curing healing factor.  If that's the problem then it's a bug but that speculation in your op got my gears turning.  
---
The other possibility is the application of effects.  So if for example TS applies the 25% after some other effects like weapon mods but junkies is 50% of base unmodded damage.  If true than the damage delta between junkies and ts isn't that big a deal though you still get a relative accuracy bonus from junkies.  
---
I'll check if I have any junkies and ts weapons with the same effects on my junky character, iirc I probably do.
---
That would be the long and short of it.
---
Had that happen, just went back to the item on Twit h and hit claim and it said success.
---
Did you do it? If not I can help you with it.
---
With the update this morning? Awesome. I haven’t been able to get on today, but I wasn’t happy when I was all the sudden over weight instantly yesterday.
---
I'd love to see other FPS game modes for sure.  Team vs team with checkpoints similar to battlefield, ctf, base assault, etc.
---
I know they never cease to amaze me with just how incompetent they are.
---
It works while crouching tho and it’s actually a pretty substantial boost honestly. On my bloodied build it has saved my ass a couple times for sure. Obviously it’s more beneficial on things like heavy or black powders but I would take a 15% chance to reload instantly lol
---
 I have Fallout 1st and have not lost a thing on maybe 20 transfers now. Very handy indeed.
---
If you do the cryptid quests you get the plan for a stuffed wendigo to hang on your wall.
---
It can be glitchy but I went back to the item on Twitch after linking and claimed it then it just said success.
---
I was playing with one guy that was older than me and another that was younger than me.  I had to translate some stuff that the older one said to the younger one.  One of them was what he meant by "toon".
---
Then I realized how old I had gotten.
---
The flechette harpoon gun mod has a hidden effect that reduces weapon degradation per shot. This is needed because the game degrades weapon condition for every projectile shot. I think the reload bug was causing this effect to break.
---
Finding new people to fight both against and with and inventing ways to mess with pasificts. 
---
I mean, ran one player off the server just by going around their camp and turning off every light. 
---
That was fun.
---
Thanks! I did the same
---
I’m so glad to be playing my sniper again.
---
snifff....I missed you man.
---
I dont have that problem, use weapon smith and have high intelligence and fix it. Should last about 60 or more
---
Like others have said they don't have to be on a team with you.  If you go to harder events and see someone get downed, stim them ASAP.
---
If you don't find anyone, I'll be on after 8pm Eastern and I will do it for you.  Ign same as Reddit
---
Take him up to the prison
---
Whoa, hold up there. Battle Royale isn't the same as a Deathmatch, CTF, KotH, etc. Don't give Bethesda ideas that they might implement. Battle Royale involves starting with nothing and gearing up as you go. Those other game modes typically involve pre-selected load outs, which Nuclear Winter had no support for. They would not be compatible with Nuclear Winter and the Perk Card system. It's bad enough as it is having 2 maps with 2 map sizes. You have no opportunity to switch your Perk Cards to suit the different gameplay styles required for each variant. For example, if I know the map will be the full Morgantown map, I don't want Hacker or Picklock. I'd rather have something like Gun Runner instead, and that's just one perk card change.
---
Also consider the loot situation. If you're constantly respawning and having to find loot in a Battle Royale game mode with a finite amount of loot and no load outs... It will be a disaster.
---
I would also argue that people interested in NW aren't necessarily interested in CTF, DM, etc. Most people see NW as a variant of PvP and assume that anyone who enjoys PvP would enjoy NW. That's not correct. The people who did PvP in Adventure and Survival rarely show up in NW. Though both are technically PvP, they are different enough to attract different subsets of players. It would be better to implement a completely separate game mode for things like DM, CTF, etc.
---
Glad I wasn't the only one
---
The game is actually really good and that's why I personally believe people get so upset.  There is soooooo much potential here to be one of the greats if they could just stop screwing up so badly every other week.
---
No no i meant *eventually* they’ll get more space. Look at the first newsletter that came out with 1st and they said *planning* to. Still doesn’t change the fact they’re lying scum, why am i being downvoted? I thought this entire reddit sub was anti bethesda money grubbing
---
not yet, are you on right now?
---
You get loot in game?
---
Hard to say.  I have an explosive fixer, and it breaks fast.  That being said, it’s always been a fragile gun.  I haven’t noticed a significant difference vs last weekend, pre patch.
---
I played a melee Tuesday-Thursday, so I avoided guns while things were broken.
---
Eh, if it happens it happens, not too worried.
---
It's gone since patch 16, plenty of posts about it, and no todays patch didnt change it back unfortunately
---
I didn't play for long but i found 2 last night. Mainly I'm buying Wrapping Paper and crafting the Large Presents (Equip Chemist to make Two for One!)
---
Events.
---
Especially a Violent Night and uranium fever, those are great. Just try to tag stuff, being explosives as the mobs will be very concentrated.
---
Loot after event.
---
Yes, but if you get the plasmsa grenade plan from that gift. 1.7k would be a steal  ;)
---
The +200 is the bug, it's only meant to be +100 without Calibrated Shocks
---
You need to push yourself, go into those high level areas and kill baddies, do events, and claim workshops. Good luck 👍
---
That is basically what happened once i crossed the mountain and began walking over the trees. i had to keep walking or i would fall through the map.
---
I recall Bethesda mentioning before they want to implement faction based PVP. I'd love to see a PVP Brotherhood vs Enclave.
---
Lead locations
---
Funny enough there litterally was one in toxic valley when game came out.
---
Was a pvp event at the civil war spot. You chose a side and fought the other. Always was buggy for me, then it just vanished from game.
---
I don't know why the downvotes, and yeah I knew you meant eventually. I was just saying it hasn't happened yet. (In fact, the opposite)
---
Yeah sucks, I relied heavily on it. Probably a push for buying Fallout 1st or a fix finally made it in, who knows.
---
Sounds like the raids.
---
Well Rested XP bonus, Cranberry Relish XP Bonus, Brain Fungus Soup INT Bonus. Kill lots of Super Mutants and do some Events. Take Workshops and do the Defend/Retake Events for a good bit of XP!
---
Cranberry relish! Go to the farm to the north (someone help me with the name) and gather cranberries.  You will need gourds, sugar and wood. (Gather snaptails in the creek near flatwoods.) Dont forget to equip Green Thumb if you have it. It will make gathering much faster. Each relish will give you +10% XP. Add in well-rested and you will gain a LOT of XP.
---

---
I know it was a bug, but if all the things to fix, why fix something people rely on as opposed to fixing the things that people actually complained about. After relying so heavily on it, I would have to do a complete character rebuild just to get the same effects. Not even worth it at this point. Might end up being the end of Fallout for me.
---
Capturing workshops is surprisingly good during double xp weekends.  Just go in, capture, then immediately leave.  Don't bother with the "defend" event, but feel free to come back later on for the retake event.  
---
Make sure you stash all junk as you go, because you are open to pvp while in the workshop area.  If you have no junk the worst that will happen if  you get murdered by some other player is the loss of a few caps but selling a coule things to an npc vendor will recoup that.  Sneaking conceals your map pin making you less of a target.  
---
Beyond that as others have said events and I'd also add that enemy dense areas that spawn equivalent level enemies are good.  top of the world and the surrounding areas would probably yield close to 1 full level per clear for example.
---
I'm all twitchy from those bells. Lol.  Keep thinking I hear them when its just bugs.
---
We're so happy you're enjoying the event!!
---
I may be in the minority but I enjoy the Possum stuff and am looking forward to Squirrel stuff being added.
---
Joined!
---
You can still get scrap out of the scrap box but you will not be able to put more in.
---
For shotgunners or lever action it could be good but if you already have a tanky build, too mich BR is useless :/
---
So they can make more Fallout 1st sales ? So maybe the idea if people lose 100lbs, they will reconsider buying Fallout 1st, that way you have unlimited jump and the weight becomes a non issue. I am just speculating but it's likely a marketing strategy vs picking a non issue bug to fix .. I am still not buying Fallout 1st regardless, just means I carry less or have to dump my junk or something .. we will adapt and not let them win .. they so focused on non essential money making bugs, they missing the point but that's being the case since day 1, so doubt anything will change now.

---
yes - you'll hear bells jingling as the santa suited ones walk around.  
---
The significance of the sound at bolton didn't register at first, as I heard the bells, but could not fins the source.  It wasnt until I got to Morgantown and actually saw /and/ heard one that I kn/realized I had missed the one at bolton.  
---
BTW, If they are in line of sight, but out of auditory range, some of them have lit xmas light strings as a necklace, so they really stand out.
---
I thought it was 30 :O
---
yup, just add hubertos19#0200
---
I built on cliffsides for awhile when I was first starting out, near the top of the map.  If done right, you build in away where you only worry about them attacking you from 1 or 2 sides so the amount of defense you need to create is minimal.
---
I already barely play enough to make the PS+ cost worth it. I definitely won’t pay for 1st.
---
yea, I had that thought as well.
---
I made one large present (doubled with chemist) and got the Winter Icicle lights, which are quite pretty. I'm definitely gonna have to get me a Crashed Santa, though. Is there any way to get the wrapping paper other than paying extortionate rates at a vendor?
---
More like going to play hockey because it's called hockey but finding out its lacrosse.
---
I just got a quad ffr hunting rifle lvl 1 xD going to give it to the first person i see thats starting out
---
It's eh. But Butcher's Bounty spawns extra Tick Blood.
---
Thanks LadyDevann! I know the road has been a little bumpy for you guys recently, and we all need to hear when we're improving or making progress. This event is definitely a great step in the right direction! 
---
Merry Christmas!
---
I posted on the sub this morning to suggest all plan collectors post their GT/PSN/IGN so we can trade with eachother at the end of the event run
---
Cool
---
I know right?    
---
Thanks for the vote of confidence, the secret is listening to the community and then looking to see I can find and replicate the problem
---
maybe you can try the 10 posts created on this subject already?
---
any better with Today's hotfix?
---
Thanks wastelander
---
ouch and ouch....  
---
Any better today?
---
Arronholdt Farmstead
---
Maybe if we give them more money it will change!
---
After getting all outfits I’ve been trying to get all the plans. I’ve had plans today I didn’t even realise I needed. Still not got the plasma plan yet though 😓
---
I could not agree more, but giving you the details to make it a little more responsive....  
---
Would love to see a FAQ for each platform on Bethesda's site
---
thanks!
---
Whitesprings nukes and Molotov cocktails are always a good way. What platform are you on?
---
I just want to know if it fixed pa armor?  Haven’t logged in yet but on my excavator, if I reloaded, I lost the extra carry weight from leg mods and couldn’t map or buy things.  Pita .
---
Just keep at it, last night I found that Poseidon Power had a good concentration of them, there was a minimum of 1 per room. I easily got 10 in 30 minutes.
---
thanks for the follow up!    
---
least I can do, and the only thing if we want this ever fixed
---
any better today?
---
No.  Not when  to on loot tables now and in a month everyone will have it.
---
You keep access to the contents of the Scrap Box; you can use the junk but cannot add more. 
---
You also keep the Atomic Shop items (outfits, emotes, icons)
---
You lose the Private World access (but can still join a friend’s PW) and the survival tent, and the 1650 Atoms, if you haven’t spent them yet.
---
Why would they fix that ability? Sounds great.
---
Assuming it's like the system for elder scrolls online you can still remove items just not add them back
---
Big bend tunnel is where I’ve found the most. I have bought lots of paper and made hundred of gifts and have that many plans my stash is full. Yeah it’s only day 1 so I’m sure I will get it.
---
Drop a nuke for the queen, but instead of killing her focus on the mobs that spawn. Lots of loot. Chance for legendaries and santa scorched, TONS of XP. 
---
Cranberry relish

nope. Somebody tag the community managers
---
Ok for a second i thought u could ride a honeybeast... you mean mounted head though right? Right!? Dont play with my heart like this
---
Yeah, I saw this coming in.   Pay2win, it’s what “I do”.  Fuck that noise.
---
I didn't even think about Big Bend, good idea! Morgantown would be good too, as well as Guided Meditation (if it still soanes scorched on the inside)
---
I'd personally just craft them onto stimpacks. With chemist and super duper you get 2 plus a 3rd possible with super duper proc. If you have the purified water to dilute them you get up to 6 diluted. That is if you can manage the weight.
---
The 3 places I know spawn ticks are:
---
The lumbermill near the overseers camp.
---
The shack just down the hill from where meat week was held
---
A trailer in the mire...I think its just a bit north of where you turn in tech data.
---
with healing factor, you shouldn't need that many healing items, as it runs you back to 100% heath (less -rads, anyway) as soon as combat is over.  With vampire weapons help keep health up during combat and healing factor for after combat, I go through way more diluted radaway than I do stimpacks.
---
I think OP means something more along the lines of CoD Zombies
---
If you need explosives I’m your guy I got over 200 of 3 different grenades. Also all my weapons are explosive.
---
I’ve been finding at least 5 inside and out on both ends. Yeah Morgan town is quite good too.
---
I love that 👍🏻👍🏻
---
I got the Mounted Feral Ghoul plan and the Plasma Grenade plan yesterday from one large gift that I made myself. That character didn't have Chemist, so I only made the one. So yeah, it's pretty reasonable. From what I've seen last night, large gifts are hard to find in the wild, and you can make 2 for 1500ish caps. If you get one rare plan it makes it worth it. Plus, the gifts can give you 500 caps as well, making your investment even lower.
---
Id love to know that as well....I can't help myself from buying the paper and making myself gifts to open. Lol Wish I could do that IRL!
---
lmao, would you have something to do with that sir?
---
Or maybe that "bug" is part of a larger issue that involves other problems with power armor. I'm not going to fault them for fixing something that was broken.
---
Just a heads up in case you missed it, with chemist perk loaded you can craft two presents instead of one. And with charisma up you can get the price to 1400. So 700 per large gift. Also, you can sell after to get back 25% of what you spent so be sure to have some stuff to sell with you. :)

---
The High Capacity back pack gives more carry weight, especially if you combine it with full unyielding armor.
---
The wrapping paper is still to expensive imo even tho i have 25k caps i feel like its just not worth it
---
Glad it worked out for you. Sorry it took you pestering them for them to resolve it.
---
Oh my. Understand that Im just on break when i post these so they may not all make sense 😂
---
I know what I'm doing tonight, that's for sure! Lol
---
Yes once you log out and back in. There’s no pop up or anything but if you go into atom shop you’ll see they’re owned.
---
Have to be very lucky to get it early on before spending a stupid amount of caps, I got lucky with a bloodied bear arm with faster swing in the last sale, less then 250 scrip and it dropped yet I know people that are over 10k Deep and nothing, I’m going to try and get the plan for under 8k caps over the next few days before i drop 80k on wrapping paper
---
If the person hasn’t completed the tadpole swim test, you can swim it and they’ll get xp. With double xp going this will level them faster than any other method. They’ll also get the rewards like stim packs and purified water.
---
Uninstall.
---
I love hearing the creepy sleigh bells!!!!
---
I dropped some dude/dudette that was level 5, a full set of unyielding leather armor, all level 5. Should be a good start for him/her.
---
I also started playing Bethesda games with Morrowind, been hooked ever since. A few bugs here and there are typical for them if we're being honest.
---
You can check the daily/weekly challenges by opening your map / going to menu / select challenges and look thru them.
---
It's a bug.. Always was.. Don't rely on bugs.. They get fixed
---
An angry woman that would take my nuts off with a cleaver if I took back her ring.
---
Lol it’s really fun but my poor stash is maxed out. I’ve been having to drop loads of legendaries and just keep the 3*.
---
Yeah, but then I have to pay 50-100k in caps on a set of armor. Plus go through all the crap to get the backpack.
---
those two things have nothing to do with each other. Bethesda isnt limiting camp budget for fun. just look how long it takes to load a camp, times 24 people going in and out of the server in addition to all the other information being tracked. item locations, item condition, item quantity, npc actions ect. bethesda will increase the budget when they are confident they can do it without pushing too much server stability issues. 
---
from Bethesda's perspective, they will want players to have more budget so they can buy more atom show decorations. this isnt some effort by Bethesda to ignore your requests.
---
Personally I'm really hoping to grind out the Deathclaw tonight -that's the one I want the most. I already got 2 mothman plans last night tho!
---
Oh the shame. The shame.
---
My dumbass takes a lot of damage
---
It's nice that scorched are now a much better enemy to farm. There is a post with a good list of farming spots as well if you haven't seen ithttps://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ea4q47/top_25_locations_to_farm_holiday_scorched_3/
---
Where'd you get that from?
---
👍 I think the size of the perceived dumpster fire is also relative to the platform they play on. For me it's been more of a wastebasket fire. I play on PC and have experienced a minimum of bugs that actually had an effect on my play. I've only been playing since the NW release but I'm I've 600 hrs and the only notable one (for me) was the PA freeze. And one terminal freeze an the enclave. I get the occasional disconnect but the majority of the time it's actually my crappy ISP. Honestly though if my experience was what the PS4 players have been going through I would have walked away already.
---
It’s bugged like the leg armor pieces and removes carry bonuses on reload. Unsure if today fixed it.
---
Just a hunch man 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
There's nothing new
---
loading into a public server that a friend is also in. I drop the goods in a container in a room that requires a specific access key.
---
My friends who've been kind of taking a break have even jumped in and joined me for some Santa Scorched hunting. Made me pretty happy to be with the squad again and hearing them like "I HEAR ONE!!" And being excited about things again. Feelsgood.
---
&gt;Linked Accounts
---
Sadly, cant see them in Atomic shop. Linked Accounts still empty, Twitch says Claimed
---
Bethesda's doing the sweaty-faced guy meme right now.
---
1.  Toss more low-effort stuff into the Atomic Shop so newer players will buy more.
---
2.  Fix issues that prevent camp budgets from being increased to allow older players to buy more stuff from the Atomic Shop.
---
You won't lose the atoms you've already received, you just won't get more atoms added again the next month.
---
Doing the back pack line is worth it, definitely gives a feeling of accomplishment.
---
As far as the value of the armor, if you just went with Unyielding you could get it for probably 20k ish, maybe less. One star pieces sell fir like 2-3k usually.
---
My armor is all Unyielding/AP Refresh/Sentinel, luckily I got it before everyone jumped on the bandwagon so it just took a couple of trades.
---
So theoretically speaking you can have 3000 lbs of junk in there during Fallout 1st. Lose Fallout 1st and still use all the junk stored in there afterwards
---
didn't this happen in skyrim with dragons
---
do supply crates have the same ai as dragons
---
There's nothing new there. I see completed challenges for my Halloween costume but no new challenges.
---
Yeah, I was half-joking with that comment.  if you did get it on your first box, it would indeed be a good deal.  I dropped several thousand caps last night and no plasma grenade love was given.  I did get a bunch of cool new mounted heads, the icicle lights, and a bunch of other stuff so I can't really complain.
---
Shame on you.
---
Same! Hunting them down is so much fun, plus the guaranteed legendaries is fantastic.
---
Indeed, they finally have a purpose other than farming ammo! Lol.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out tonight when I log on :)
---
You know it.
---
How well do you know this friend? Seems strange if your only anchor in there is manning it and somehow only some things are there.
---
Rng
---
Indeed it does, same here. I have my group of friends that I used to play with that are all happy to see me back in the game playing with them again. Hopefully future events have a similar vibe and concept, I really like what they did with this one.
---
The ps4 is what I play and your right I should walk away, Like you I have 600 hrs plus invested and really like the game but it still is a buggy janky mess a great deal of the time for me. I just think any new players should have a complete overview of the game.
---
Agreed - just wanted to clarify as it’s always the first question when they tease stuff like this
---
I think it might be too early to sell them, maybe wait until the last few days?
---
What about it do you enjoy though? 
---
That was a very wordy and impassioned speech that boils down to flimsy justifications of poor design and “I just like it cause I like it”.
---
Can you give some examples of combat or base building perhaps?
---
As much as i like to believe it, i'll have to see for myself first.
---
If someone has recently nuked an area, once the nuke wears off, some areas tend to spawn a round of bots instead for a short period of time, then it resumes spawning the normal enemies. Whitesprings does this often.
---
Its the consoles. They really are struggling.
---
build you camp on the pond south of vault 76.....two sources of ticks very close....max out class freak to mitigate the downside of healing factor or just get rid of healing factor altogether.
---
A lot of those plans are nowhere near worth 1400k caps some are worth way more like the plasma granade and dense plans but everything thing els is worth less then 1k
---
There was a mailbox dug up in the files a long time ago
---
What do you mean?
---
Glad to hear it, I mainly use melee but I missed my Fatman.
---
There was the Christmas one. Then two sections that both said details coming soon
---
Yeah. Line in the Sand or Uranium Fever could have been this, but instead it's just a couple enemies every few minutes who die instantly. I want to be overwhelmed by enemies. I don't want to repair pipes. I just want to shoot a seemingly endless wave of enemies. I want a reason to use a Fat Man.
---
I have a full set of weightless and weapon weight armor works great for being sneaky beaky.
---
I’m one piece away from finishing my weightless wood set
---
Yeah, that’s exactly it too. 
---
Next sale - increase your camp budget by 25% for only 1500 atoms!
---
I'm pretty sure on Black Friday it was down to $12...
---
Just found it kinda weird that in some of my Junkies weapons it boosts them by around 40 dmg or so, especially the energy ones, but when it comes to bullet weapons its either no change or 2-3 dmg, really odd.. I'll post pics just to see if you can spot the difference, cause im stumped honestly..

I’m thinking of picking up Fallout 1st today and love the game. I don’t have friends that play it though. I can usually play after 2000hrs though (6month old).
---
My comment was directed at the person who said it uses more
---
Yo could sell for 1.5-2.5k each. Just don’t hold on to them. People constantly think that people will pay higher prices after the event is over and it never happens. They always get stuck with them.
---
Lil booty bot
---
I just got the pipe gun automatic and laser medium scope plans.  Those were some very expensive plans much rarer than the plasma grenade.  Looks like the raider armor plans are the only obtainable, really rare ones not added to the loot table.  I’ve heard of players also getting shielded plans.
---
Sweet!, yeh the deathclaw must look pretty cool
---
Hard bargain 3, Grape Mentats, unyielding set 15 health, charisma bobble head bring it down to 1100-1200.
---
Eh, that's not always true. Some items will.increase in value after an event ends. It's the law of supply and demand. Looking at you, Tenderizer.
---
I've had it happen numerous times, just as you describe, most of the time the body doesn't shift very far from where it was first spotted, this thing just disappeared into thin air entirely.  It literally disappeared as my thumb was hitting the button, nano seconds away from finally getting the gun I wanted!  So frustrating.
---
No, I don’t let them know I’m transferring stuff. They are typically on the other side of the map and I’m in a stash house. 
---
Maybe i should be more trusting.
---
Lol
---
I ran Poseidon last night and my 2nd Santa dropped the plasma grande plan. Can't wait to get home from work and hunt santa scorched. I'm a plan addict. The legendaries they drop are a decent source of scrip income too.  Two 2* and three 1* in 30 minutes, none that I'll keep since they were too low of a level plus I'm lvl 22 and 2x XP will level me so fast they'd be obsolete quick. Did get a lvl 35 shishkabob that I'm gonna hang on to till I can use it.
---
I’m well over 10k towards that bear arm.  Probably closer to 30k.
---
i understand this is sarcrasme - but i dont understand what it is a comment about , did the update do something bad ?
---
AFAIK it was supposed to be up to 50% off I thought I read somewhere? Can't remember where tho ono
---
My character is a bit of a deathclaw worshipper heh
---
Just store them and then place them again. Usually fixes the issue.

The halloween challenges are back for a week - the christmas challenges are not available yet.

Yeah same here. I like events a lot but I appreciate this not being tied to an event to kind of change things up and give us alot of opportunities to participate at your own pace - especially since the scorched come in all levels you know. Everyone can join.
---
Cranberry cobbler gives +5% XP if you don't have the recipe for the relish and all you need is cranberries and wood for that. Also the mama dolce's event give that canned meat stew which is also a +5% XP but it doesn't spoil. Mothman lighthouse event will also throw another plus 5% on top of everything.
---
Me personally?
---
I love the setting of the game.   I love the atmosphere of it, in parts.  I love building my camp, which I now I have built the way I want it after many teardowns and rebuilds.  
---
I love the Fallout world in general - the lore, the history, etc.  I love the mechanics of the game.  How it feels to move through the game and actually play it.  (That aspect is very important to me; the main reason I never got into *Witcher 3* was that I hate third person view, and I hate having to stop what I'm doing in order to watch a cut screen so often; it's a game, not a movie).  I like crafting, getting new perks, tweaking my build.  I like finding rare items to make a bunch of caps from.  I like visiting other players' camps and finding the creative things they've put together.  I like helping out lower levels when I can.
---
I have liked many things about it up to this point, but I'm over 1,000 hours into it now so I'm pretty starved for new content.  The secret quest they dropped on us the other day is pretty neat, but I'm hoping Wastelanders brings a lot of content.
---
The game feels like my home for now.  Most of my time is played late at night once my fiancee has gone to sleep and the house has quieted down.  I find it kinda relaxing to run through, get some scrip, earn some atoms, make minor adjustments to things, etc.
---
The mothman one looks pretty cool.  I got the santa crash plan too.  I think the icicle lights are probably rare.
---
Haha yes.
---
Riding one would be awesone
---
Still losing weapon condition quickly but haven't had anymore empty legendaries so hopefully just a glitch on the server I was on
---
There's also that possibility someone stumbled across it and took what they wanted which is unfortunate, but hopefully it doesn't happen again.
---
Exactly. Whoever came up with this concept needs a raise! Lol
---
that 109 dmg the same once you equip the gun?  There's display issues with junkies, I find that sometimes you see the junkies bonus to other weapons that are not equipped and only equipping them seems to display the actual damage.  
---
That said though I suspect maybe it's the explosive effect.  2 shot fires 2 projectiles, so it's possible you are seeing the explosive damage doubled wish would account for the similar damage.  you'd need a non junkies, non ts explosive minigun to confirm that hypothesis.
---
I would not spend any caps on the wall mount plans. 
---
My camp budget is full and I dont have any room, So I wont spend a single cap on one.
---
They are cosmetic only, dont impact gameplay, and dont get you legendary wall mount heads at the purveyor. 
---
More than 5caps per camp item plan is a waste of money.
---
It failed to deliver on a few bug fixes that were meant to be included and it added other, new bugs. Bethesda *literally* moved the 250 bug from weapons to armour.
---
I've been hoarding alcohol and canned dog food and equipping Good Doggy/Party Boy every 15 minutes when I need to refill my hunger because keeping spoilable food now is a joke with the new patch 16 ~~bugs~~ features
---
I've surprisingly gotten some really good legendary items from the high level scorched santa's.  I got a cavalier piece last night and a vampire ffr gamma gun today.
---
Mind sharing what rare extras you have? I would go upwards of 10k for the mothman one.
---
If i equip the Two Shot version yes, the damage is 109 on both, but if i equip the Junkies version, the Two-Shot one goes up to 168 damage.  
---
And yeah, sadly i dont have non-explosive versions :(
---
No, since you can only have one pet at a time.
---
Durability still looks fine to me, no more repro of the reload bug so far.
---
It never works that way. Everyone buys during the event. The amount of people who want these plans now will be 100x more than after the event. If you don’t sell during the event you won’t maximize the amount of people to sell to. When the event is over the ones who are willing to pay will already have them. I hear supply and demand all the time, but there is no demand after the event. Only during.
---
I have really enjoyed exploring places I haven't been to in a long time. Love those jingle bells!
---
Get back to work Todd
---
I went from level 38 to level 43 in about 2 hours of grinding events and workshops today. Just cap a workshop then defend it and head off to do an event. Rinse and repeat
---
Meaning it’s already a thing? Or just that it could be?
---
50 caps tops until the event is over and I know which ones I still need. I'd be bummed if I paid more than that and got whatever I just bought from the next gift I found.
---
Oh - i know that ; it was the "hunger and thirst as a defult mechanic" that had me puzzled - did hunger and thirst increase or something ?  Also , i know i wrote update a but really meant the update to the update ( the one form today) since your comment is new
---
Also, cured Healing Factor, sadly it didn't make the damage any higher, but atleast that's not an issue
---
I have always seen the exact opposite, and so have the people I play with so, maybe that's what you've experienced but I'm confident it typically goes the other way.
---
Yeah, this is true, but the easier you can find it, the easier *others* can find it too. Not everyone I've met respects the not-stealing bags mentality.
---
Since Pat 16 I have not been able to play with any of my friends on a private server they cannot join and I cannot invite them
---
Appreciate it! In game as Joker. Level 4. Liking it so far
---
Play NW and get double XP for both NW and Adventure.  I’m getting about 1k  Adventure XP per match.
---
Honestly it was my 5th attempt after learning the plan. Screamed my house down like a 10 year old,  as soon as I found out they was becoming legendary I said I wanted a bloodied swing speed
---
Hell yeah I got my rootbeer tapper!
---
Yeah I really dig this event.  It's vastly different from past events in a ton of ways.  Cool rewards, TONS of legendary items dropping constantly, and spread over the entire map so that it's easy to find a spot to harvest santa scorched for all players at all levels.  
---
While events that aggregate players all in 1 spot have their perks as it's cool to have huge groups of players, this event is great almost because it's pretty much the opposite.  
---
I'd love to see a hybrid event in the future with a widespread constant effect like this one, but also with some sort of "everyone in one spot" event every hour like past events.
---
In game as Joker. Level 4 with a 2 handed board! Dont know how to join up.
---
Had the same issue last night I kept jumping ahead so my friends could fast travel to me I would get one hit on the legendary with a very weak weapon and then the same random guy kept showing up and one hitting the legendary so none of my friends could get a hit I was pissed the guy just didn't get it
---
I thought you only get the Wendigo by completing Sinking Feeling. That’s where I got it.
---
PC
---
I can already tell Raiders is an asshole and I've only been on this sub less than 24 hours
---
ok then yeah I'm feeling more and more confident it's doubling your explosive damage due to ts.  that would make the difference between the 2 guns 5% and it might very well be rounding them both to 109.
---
I haven't gotten any presents through the Santatron either.
---
I would absolutely play this.
---
😂😂😂
---
Maybe yeah, just kinda weird that energy weapons arent acting the same way, I have a Two-Shot Explosive Legacy Gatling Laser that only has around 50, yet my Junkies-Explosive Laser will hit 77..
---
Is this genuine or is this sarcasm?
---
Ahh ok. I think this one was fine, it fixed the armour bug.
---
Hey, I respect your opinion, even if it's wrong.
---
If you want shoot me a friend request. I will be dropping several nukes for flux and probably helping some friends level alts. You are more than welcome to join. Shoot me a pm with your ign if you are interested. Mine is newt341.
---
Nope.
---
Play NW. You unlock rewards while also leveling up in adventure
---
It depends a lot on *how much after*.  Immediately after?  Not so much.  Everyone has the same idea.  A month after?  Maybe.
---
You already know why.
---
I just got the Mothman Plan! I'm wondering if it's possible to get the scorchbeast queen now?
---
Yeah I've been wracking my brain for places to visit- like the Watoga Civic center turned out to be a good place when I was solo for a bit- found 4 in there alone.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0
---
Thank you my good sir
---
This is the way. I only use Diluted (keep 10 regular Stimpacks max, for reviving others) and sell what I don't need, we're talking hundreds after a few days. Very very handy! I stopped selling Purified Water cause you can make waaay more Diluted Stims with them.
---
-
---
Ticks are easy to find, there's a few good spots, and you get Stims all over the place anyway.
---
Dude WTF I offered encouragement if in your bad mood you take it out on someone who just wanted to help suggests a deeper mental issue, I don't squad, I solo for this general reason to avoid toxic people, but if you wish to try again maybe post days and time zones you play, build etc
---
This - the benefits are for more or less every aspect of the game except damage for ranged builds.  
---
I'd add though that if you carry any melee weapon as a "just in case" you are getting up to +15 str from unyielding which iirc is a 75% damage bonus - to put that in perspective 9 ranks in melee perks is only a 60% bonus.
---
What it takes to be a HERO!😢
---
Thanks a lot I have not been on in two days, this will help me catch up.☺
---
Howd you get the gift
---
I know this is sarcasm, but I’m actually enjoying this game, surprisingly. It’s my 3rd time trying a free weekend, and I don’t know if something was updated, but it’s finally clicking. I enjoy the exploration and weapon variety. The combat feels better than it did before. My only issue is the lag/glitchy-ness. Playing Xbox one x. I’m seriously considering buying the game. But I might just wait until it’s in game pass.
---
Is it bugged or is the drop rate low?  I didn't see one from him yesterday but I got a lot from fighting scorched.
---
kinda hard to compare if they are not like weapons yeah? gat laser =! laser.  gat laser has much increased ROF and laser has much better base damage.
---
So Bethesda customer support called me on the phone as well. Ah the power of reddit. Told the lady it seemed my issue was fixed they told me I was being refunded. The lady preceded to tell me Bethesda customer support phone line wasn’t for customer support and in the future to use the ticket system. The phone number should only be used if there was an issue with the ticket system. Which I informed her there was since I’ve been waiting for my issue to be fixed since November. I she went on to tell me that I should have updated the ticket(I did) or started a new ticket(I did). Then told me I would just have to wait next time for someone to get back to me. I said it was kinda funny that the day I make a Reddit post is the day my issue is fixed and I get calls. And I told her if there was a next time I wouldn’t be spending money with them. It’s like this company doesn’t want people to keep buying their products. Anyway thank you all again for your upvotes and comments. I have no doubt the issue would have been ignored longer if I hadn’t posted.
---
Go to the place that shouldn’t be spoken in here. They will all tell you the same exact thing. I’ve got over 200+ trades in there. You can ask people with 500+ trades and they will tell you the same thing. There is no demand after the event is over. It was proven at fasnacht it was proven in the Halloween event and it will be proven in this one. The grenade plan will be the only one that will still have demand because it can be used to complete a badge. The event is only been live for a day and people already have everything.
---
It was so broke they just threw it out.
---
Was a great way to farm scrap too :(
---
Yeah true, oh well, im just glad I got better accuracy tbh, worth moving over to Junkies considering the nerf on Two-shot-Explosive..  
---
Thanks for taking time out your day to help me figure this issue out btw, means alot :)
---
I think I read that Vault 96 was supposed to be a horde mode essentially?  But they never opened it, probably due to the issues from Vault 94.
---
Camden park, big bend tunnel, wavy willards, point pleasant,  helvetia, sutton, tyler co. fair
---
I know its been forever since this was posted but try the one church in point pleasant where the mothman museum is
---
This is what worries me for Wastelanders.  Their track record they have with these patches... while I'm sure they have corrected some things- the adverse effect they potentially have on other parts of the game worries me.  My thoughts are also on- are they going to release this DLC with the existing issues with the base game in place?  It almost seems as if they delayed Wastelanders because they didn't want to release it in the same condition the game itself came out in.  But are we delayed until next year just for it to come out in the condition we currently play in (with problems they still have to address?)  Maybe I'm optimistic, I do believe there has to be some programmers on their end that geniunely care about this game, maybe it's a staff shortage, or a workload issue, but after a year now, I mean... c'mon already.
---
Would be cool to have dungeon raids where there's just hella big interior spaces and hella hard enemies you could grind out for hella xp and rewards
---
I can't remember any features they've added post-release that didn't also add associated bugs of varying degrees.
---
Where can I go for positive reviews/info/guides?  I went on youtube and it was passive aggressive at best.  
---
I played to around lvl 35 at launch.  I decided to comeback and play today after hearing I could rent a private server.  I'm not really sure where to start...especially with the event going on.
---
Lol sorry to here bout yer lack of head mounts
---
Downloading 2nd copy as we speak.  Haven't played since launch and the GF never played.
---
no worries happy holidays and be careful out in the wasteland.
---
Someone on PS4 was posting videos of the same thing
---
Sorry to hear that....Definitely submit that ticket if you haven't already. This is B.S.
---
Weird flex,  but ok
---
Genuine it's my first time playing.
---
Don’t forget Big Bend Tunnel!!
---
My turrets attacked Graham, then he stood there and destroyed all my walls. I ported in to see him doing so and had to logout to make him stop.
---
Sent you a pm with the details.
---
Not sarcasm. I'll be buying if it's on sale after the trial.
---
If I were to buy this, get the outfit and then cancel it, would it take my outfit away?
---
Hell yeah dude! I friggin love this game but u’ll find the jury is very divided it’s a love hate type of game and me I’m in ur boat I love and adore it.
---
So do you guys officially ignore any post now that isn't praising you or pointing out a specific bug now?
---
Would play capture the flag 25v25 every single day of my life.
---
Enforcer. Neuters any and all melee enemies.
---
Ever stop and think there are conversations that just aren't meant for you?  I mean if someone showed up with a god rolled rifle and you were a 100% melee user would your input of "it's useless trash. 5 caps, take it or leave it" really be that helpful?
---
I’m guessing it drops quite regularly as I’ve seen a few posts saying they’ve got it.
---
Its nothing like the raids. Have you played the raids?
---
i second this, neuters the queen with a combat shotgun, and is god tier in raids
---
Healing salves count as stims if you're looking for easy to farm health items that dont weigh much. With the right legendary armor and mod cards they weigh 2lbs for 200. Run the rivers in the forest for blood leaf and soot flowers gather wood at lumberyard and spam a creek or water source near your base and you can make 160-300 healing salves in 10-20 minutes.
---
Either bloody mess or super duper
---
Thank you :D
---
Its awesome seeing the festive suit on the higher tier ones...they took two atom shop suits and sold them to scorched..for inflated price im guessing
---
Nerd rage and serendipity, make any build able to be bloodied and almost unkillable.
---
For real! I didn’t t either
---
i miss my sequin dress
---
Yeah. Endless waves of enemies while solving puzzles or objectives.
---
I’ve encountered this the past several days.  I go to pick up and items by ‘take’ it....nothing happens.  This only occurs with open world items...items in containers I can ‘take’ without issue.
---
I think it’s a server lag/latency issue...because often times I can go around trying to pick up items that I can’t....after about 10 seconds they eventually disappear from view and end up in my inventory.
---
This doesn’t occur every game though which makes me think it’s certain servers that are having issues.  Once, I see it happening I quit and enter a new server and it’s often corrected.  I’m experiencing this in About 1/5 servers I join.
---
Just checked myself. Revolver pipe still double dip.
---
the OP wanted my opinion. 
---
My opinion is any camp related item sells for 5 caps.
---
If you have ever stopped by my vendor, you would understand this, as all of my camp plans are priced at 5caps, regardless of rarity. 
---
That is what I think they are worth. 
---
Dont ask for opinions if you arnt prepared for ones that you dont like.
---
Lol same reason I joined
---
As far as I know it just has a really low drop rate but I haven't heard of anyone else getting presents from their Santatron either.
---
This event has revealed an underlying problem with a lot of the updates: Lack of decent rewards. While I'm not the biggest fan of mounted heads, there are a lot of them mixed in with other cosmetics and non-cosmetic rewards, so it feels pretty good to go hunting these Santa Scorched. Little touches like their costumes and the jingling also add to the spice.
---
Fundamentally this game needs to get back to making gameplay rewarding for the more experienced players. This was a good way to get started, hopefully Wastelanders comes with a lot of new assets (and clearly some camp budget would help a lot, given the many requests lately).
---
It is a 1% chance about every 7 min for a present.
---
Wouldn't mind seeing more of them, and for the skins to be more of prewar design style like quantum or other lore designs. I'd like more models that aren't faction based.
---
It says limited time, 3 days for the outfit
---
Super Duper or Serendipity.
---
I've yet to see anything other than fertilizer.
---
I found Point Pleasant had the highest concentration of Santa Scorched(at least in my play through). You have a good detailed map! Thanks.
---
I got annoyed just deleted them once and for all got about 20% of my budget.
---
There are no puzzles in the raid. Objectives sure, but any game in any mode has objective.
---
The raids are terrible, bugged flawed half instanced messes. The worst in any game ive ever played and they have no raid boss so they dont even actually meet all the requirements of a raid.
---
So *this* is what the Patch 16 devs have been doing with their time!
---
You answered your question in your title.
---
Subconsciously you clearly want to be single. This game will provide the perfect fuel.
---
Truthfully there is no wrong place to start.  It's a sand box, go play in the sand.  Level 35 you should be good anywhere but cranberry bog.  Just explore and have fun, you'll find the side quests and dailies.  Also events will give you more aid food and chems than you can use.  Just throwing that out there.
---
And the most positive stuff comes from filthy casuals fallout 76 redit channel but it's a little like wearing rose tinted glasses, they have rules about posting anything and I mean anything negative.  That said it is rather refreshing after a bad patch day where this sub not only sinking into the ocean but on fire.
---
I haven't found a good youtubers unfortunately.  I find they either are chasing the money and reporting  for clicks or they have a very little idea how to actually play the game.  I would honestly suggest making friends in game with someone who knows more than you and learn from them lol.  One exception to this.  I really like Jug for building tips.  His videos are pretty good and no politics or opinion stuff, just building tips.
---
Yea, definitely keep doing them! I traded a lead lined plan for a fixer plan and a JE combat rifle. Would have been happy with just one or the other since I didn't know what they were selling for, but the guy I traded with said one wasn't enough and offered me both. Both those dailies will be in my rotation until I stop playing
---
It doesn’t. There have now been enough events and trading groups to put in enough data to see when the best times to sell. People still believe the supply and demand argument because on paper it makes sense. In reality it hasn’t worked out that way once. This plasma grenade plan may be the exception to the data because it’s needed to complete a badge.
---
Did you mean 1,400 caps because no one has over a million caps.
---
Yes, it’s very awesome. I got multiple legendary scorched that way but I think there’s a limit per server. I went to all of the fissure sites and towards the last few they stopped spawning when I mined the ultracite veins. I went to a new server and it started working again though.
---
Without any relevant perk cards: Terrible.
---
With Butcher's Bounty and Super Dupper: Fantastic.
---
I tried it. Got a mounted squirrel for 1400 caps. The rest was just ordinary crap. Not worth it.
---
Damn, I hope it arrives mid January. It will have some bug(s) though. Bug free is not realistic anymore lol.
---
I gotta say, I'm having a blast hunting down Santascorched.
---
No this wasn’t the jingle and where I was were only mole miners.
---
I got all the map fragments and found the area on the map.... What are the packages for?
---
It's already been proven to be the case; lots of people cancelled their subs after the first month, and have reported that this is indeed what happens. Search the sub and see for yourself.
---
A friend and I were on his private server, just the two of us, and got 4 legendaries with gifts - I think it's just random. A word of caution though, don't repair the missile launcher, it'll blow their bodies to a mysterious place sometimes and you'll lose them forever
---
We already have one; it's called "The Whitespring Gold Clubhouse."
---
One thing that was interesting to note from the wording of the ITV this week was that they planned on fixing the last bug as soon as possible while saying they plan on fixing it before Wastelanders. Also, they did say there would be more previews in the new year so a hopeful guess is early February, maybe late January.
---
I can’t get this working for the life of me on xbox. Claimed on my phone and on my Mac, and logged out and back in a bunch. Still nothing showing. Any ideas? Has anyone got this working on Xbox?
---
It was a glitch/exploit with the +200 carry weight
---
Got fixed in the last update
---
there is your present, some dry up sh.t , 
---
what else would you expect from bethesda
---
thanks for this.
---
Oh wow thanks for posting this. Yeah it's weird nobody else posted about this one.
---
Also does everyone get the same code? My friend got all the map fragments but nothing showed on his map when he hit the black light. He tried using my numbers but it doesn't work.
---
Bloody Mess. It makes everything better.
---
I agree with this statement 100%. I wouldn't be so upset about it if the entire game was just one big dumpster fire, like the media generally makes it out to be. When it works, it's really good. It's just that it hardly ever works.
---
Just curious is that your YouTube name?  I saw the same sn in some prank call vids.
---
You're going to enjoy Scorched Earth ( . . . if it doesn't crash out, which it does occasionally). Also not being sarcastic, as I enjoy the game as well.
---
The fuses on the wall in one of them is arguably a puzzle. 2 Mirelurk Queens could be considered bosses.
---
I just said what he described is close to the raids; not that they are well done.
---
I need to know when I should start lockpicking every Santatron to steal presents.
---
I understand why you're being downvoted, useless negativity. But yes every game company I have seen on reddit only responds to positive stuff on here. If they respond to negative posts it will usually just add fuel to the fire, and imo it's best to let people calm down and put down the torches and pitchforks before making official replies
---
No this is Lon3Wanderer (from Twitch) but I lost my old Reddit account. I run the Grafton Gangster’s faction so that’s why this name. Gonna have to check out these videos now though!
---
He's already spent the money; OP might as well give it a try. Also, why are you even *in* this sub?
---
Can we get a Baby Yoda mounted head?
---
So I just finished the tadpole line yesterday. Got my little tadpole backpack, but built myself a level 50 version that gave +60 carry weight (if I remember correctly). Is that the "High Capacity" backpack you speak of or are there more quests to get more weight?
---
But everyone on the internet says it's trash, how can it be a good game. Plus I get all tingly calling it traaasshhh
---
I mean, you've nothing to support this argument. 🤷‍♂️
---
There are several factors that go into this:
---
* Is the event going to come around again?  And how soon?  Meat Week stuff was largely worthless because it happened twice.  Fasnacht and Mischief Night are tied to a specific, short time of year.
---
* How many of a particular item dropped during the event?  If pretty much everyone who participated got multiples, it will never be worth it.
---
* How desirable is the item?  Tenderizers are big, extremely heavy things that have no practical use.  The market for those is dinky because you're mainly talking about completionists.  A Fasnacht Mask, on the other hand, goes with pretty much any setup, has its own little Level Up challenge, and weighs virtually nothing.
---
same!
---
Currently a free trial running :)
---
That's the sub I'm looking for.  I understand the game has issues.  It is what it is at this point.  I'd rather see the positives and get me hyped up to play a game I already own.
---
As for the youtubers, you hit the nail on the head.  It was either click bait, omg this game is even worse than before!  Another terrible patch!  Devs trying to nickle and dime people!  Or it was  new players trying to give new player guides.  I'd get 10 minutes in (learning almost nothing)...and they'd say "I'm not exactly sure how to do this, I only have 20 hours".
---
I'll check out Jug.
---
I'm glad!   What's your IGN?  I'll fix up a bit of a welcome kit and come find you to drop it off!
---
I like to drop fun outfits for new players like the spacesuit &amp; skeleton costume. It's fun to watch them put them on and jump around with excitement!
---
I think it was accidental, but if they fixed it Bethesda would instantly be called the grinch who stole Christmas. Better to just leave that glitch in since it's a holiday and they got a lot of negative PR recently (since launch)
---
The final step tells me that my established Twitch account can't make the connection to my new Prime trial account 🙄
---
Bloody mess is great for all builds
---
The free trial is for fallout 1st? I thought it was just for the game lol
---
They are world creeps so no they are not bosses. The fuses are puzzles in the same way a circuit breaker is
---
Did that. Just kinda annoying on all 5 characters......
---
This almost always happens to me anytime I have a horde event spawn in the mire.  I fast travel and I get there just in time for something else to have killed the legendary.
---
Thank you for this
---
Yeah I’ve found five or six already. It’s petty neat.
---
Interesting, I received a Gognaks Axe last night, I thought it was from a gift but looking at this list its not listed as loot.  Not sure where I picked it up...
---
Great news! It's the first one I've encountered
---
Icicle lights, crashed Santa, mounted honeybeast and mothman.
---
Adrenaline with gunfu, takes out crowds in a breeze. Especially with a instigating weapon 😁
---
You can do whatever you want. I’m not arguing. I’m giving you a solid year of experience with being a merchant. Especially when it comes to rare plans which I deal in the most. You can take my suggestion or you don’t. That’s up to you. I’m trying to help you maximize your selling to get the most out of it. Not to prove something all big traders already know.
---
You're not guaranteed a possum badge every time you do;  you just have a chance at getting a badge
---
Oki
---
That's the base backpack, you can buy plans for backpack mods at the Pioneer Scout vending machines for badges, one of them being a High Capacity which doubles it to 120, but lowers your rad resist (not really a big deal tbh, 60 from 0 is still 0)
---
It works amazing on broadsiders and harpoon gun as they only hold 1, and now can rapid fire 4 - but crossbow is bugged unfortunately, it goes from 1 to 4 in the slot but you have to manually reload in per missing shot.  So if you have 0 rounds in you have to hit reload, let the animation finish, hit reload again x4 total.
---
It's definitely been a lot of fun so far.
---
Circuit Breaker is what I meant to say originally.
---
Fallout 76: the gift that keeps on taking.
---
I welcome the downvotes. It just shows me how many people really abandoned this game and this sub.
---
I agree, the game outside of events is just so... bland. A rare plan or outfit is rare, and about the best reward you can get.
---
They’ve always existed, just very rare. I hope they keep the spawn rates they have for this event after it’s over. It gives players a reason to visit so many areas that largely get ignored after a while.
---
Yes its not a puzzle. Its fixed in position, labeled and with directions
---
Absolutely, had 3-5 in Morgantown Airport interior.
---
They won’t really be worth anything until January.
---
Which outfits drop ? Is there Christmas themed outfits. Never saw outfits in the loot pool in the datamined post
---
Technically both are true haha
---
Gun Fu.
---
Sorry I meant the ones already in game.
---
okay, man. good talk.
---
Man, if that's true, I can't believe I've never seen one at level 281. I hope you're right and they do.
---
Sweet!   Claimed mine, and looking forward to logging in tonight and seeing the new stuff!
---
I was looking for a more specific prediction. You just gave me the same 4-month window that everyone already knows.
---
Try charleston capital for a non event location, make a lot of noise and most of the ghouls will come to you. Then head downstairs to clean up. Normally see 2-3 legendaries when i go, underrated location.
---
between my wife and i we spent about 95k caps (had alts with max caps) and didnt get it. it's the only plan we want, after 700+ events in the ash heap this seems like a much better drop chance
---
I’m getting diseases and I have carnivore.  I use spoiled meet to fine tune my radiation level for my bloodied build.  Unamused.
---
Find me one single piece of an announcement, press release, interview anything prior to the game's launch that says:
---
"Fallout 76 is going to be a text book classic RPG"
---
Christ, they even said it's going to "it's still going to have that fallout feel but is different"
---
Notice how that doesn't sound at all like "It's a classic RPG experience"
---
That's the problem with people and 76. They wanted it to be something it was never going to be. Something it was never advertised as, and refused to shift their expectations despite the fact that 76 was very clearly going to be different.
---
green thumb
---
Because that's all *anyone* knows. If you want me to make something up, you should have said so.
---
Today's change was described as a "rollback", rather than a code addition ("hotfix"), so no other changes should have been made, apart from removing the code that was breaking the legendary effects.
---
Funny... i posted a similar thing yesterday about lights... 50/50 for 4 months now and it was deleted lol.   
---
Dude... i just want to literally GIVE YOU MONEY... try not to censor me eh?
---
I actually predicted a horde mode in a "future of 76" post. 
---
I think it'll eventually come along with NPCs/Settlements.
---
Help a faction defend/attack a location kind of deal.
---
I noticed that if you have items stored in your camp from previous builds that if you delete it, it may free up space. I redid my camp but couldn't put a lot down due to budget. I deleted some misc items I wasn't gonna use and it freed up some space to build.
---
It happens to varying degrees to different people.  Some people eliminate it by fast travel and some by shutting down and loging back in.  Some people it just keeps happening regardless.
---
I love this game
---
Nice, I didn't realize this was a thing. Now I know where I'm taking my toon next! Thank you :-)
---
Great post sir.  
---
I was thinking at first your special find was some sort of explosive plan. 
---
I was happy to see you got your sugary cereal fix. 
---
This made me chuckle.   After a long day at the office, this post was a welcome relief.
---
Especially if they included a Hella copter. And placed it below the newly renamed Hellavitia.
---
Do you play a sniper in PVE? If yes, how does that go inside small areas? What's the gameplay like?
---
AHH lol my bad 👍
---
Tell me about it.  I am so jealous when I see people posting that they got it on their first or second present opened.
---
No it’s the way I worded it. Did you get all excited thinking there was new outfits.
---
Am level 330 saw my first one 2 weeks ago a 2 star but got nothing from it
---
Did you try shotguns or chameleon armor/mutations? These are my core needs for my character, and I can’t really do anything until those two issues are addressed.
---
I've found a ton of them on low level santa scorched
---
I fought one at Morgantown airport yesterday, I wasn't sure if I'd seen them before or not.  That's cool they added them.
---
Really liking the ranger helmet /combat armour combo with free states bag at the moment. It’s what I run. 
---
Stellar camp. Lot of thought went into making it fit into fallout
---
I found a few legendary Scorched before the event but they were really rare.
---
The guns that were added for 76 all have very few mods. Seems like they ran out of time to add in everything they wanted.
---
The weapons from FO4 have the most customization of anything in the game.
---
The crossbow only has 1 mod (prime) and if you use it you can never change it back to the regular version. It’s a pretty glaring oversight and it makes me think they weren’t finished developing the weapon when the game released.
---
Your one year experience must have lead you wrong because every comment you make is wrong...sorry dude
---
Lmao nice
---
Welcome to the wasteland sir.
---
lol ty.  I might be goin tin-foil hat but it was some fairly obscure YouTube post with very few views right after I’d been here.  Makes me suspect they tailor their shit based on cookies.
---
Just a note also the camp budget is probably goi g on the bobble heads and bits you have on your shelves. This sale most of my budget
---
There used to be 1 that spawned at the top of Watoga civic center and then 6 months or so ago they quit appearing.  Seems like it was after they nerfed the legendary spawns on the robots there.
---
👍 good luck.
---
Just logged it today, first time in the last 3 months, killed a scorched and then opened the gift. I got it aswell. Didn't know it was that rare.
---
Thanks. I'm always afraid I'm overdoing it with the silly bait-and-switch and over-wordy story.
---
Oh I got the icicle lights in the first large box I got.
---
What are you spending caps for? What is that paper and ehere you buy it?
---
I haven't seen one either.  Played quite a bit yesterday and some this morning.
---
Yeah, unfortunately it seems to have gotten worse in frequency and number of turrets it happens with.
---
Glad it all worked out for you!
---
Nice
---
It is true.  I've ran into them on a handful of occasions.  Probably five or six times in around 1700 hours of play,
---
Event is actually a good grind, legendaries are easier to find and I actually might buy a month of service to store all the junk I have collected.
---
Try the following “YouTubers” (in no particular order)
---
- Juicehead
---
- InovaSurvivalist
---
- AngryTurtle
---
- Captainnoob
---
Are they spawning with three stars at low levels though? I don't usually (ever?) see multistar legendaries outside those spawned by events.
---
What laws are CIG breaking?
---
Nope. I am just an idiot that misread your post. Sorry if I got your hopes up.
---
Yeah if I why Xmas stockings weren't a part of it.
---
Nice!  I'm looking for those and the plasma grenade plan still.  How do the lights look?
---
Yeah i don't know why Xmas stockings weren't a part of it.
---
Just yesterday I bought a Hisense Roku 65" HDR 4k and it blows me away on EVERYTHING except fo76!  I am not a complainer at all but jeez. Looks almost blurry, game colors are drab and so on. I played this since it's release on my older Vizio 55" HDTV in 1080 and it looks great. Both are just running on first gen Xbox one but still. I haven't had enough time to really troubleshoot it all yet but I saw something about changing the HDMI port I use for it from Auto to HDMI 1.4 or something. Can't remember specifically sitting here in my car but I see no change. I saw people saying they have to shut the HDR off but I cannot find that specific setting yet and doing this to my output port is supposed to be the equivalent. If I figure out anything else I will post.
---
Could check your status effects in your pip boy and see if it says when it will wear off. Or you could try switching servers?
---
There is a [text chat mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151) you can install. I've found it to be useful for organizing events and trades. It depends on another mod called SFE that requires updating after every game update. That mod is currently behind due to this morning's change, but it's usually fixed by the end of the day.
---
Man, if you have 10k I would just make the presents, I got several mothman heads on all 4 of my characters
---
Or my auto grenade launcher that I only hold on to because it is weightless! It'd plow some mobs
---
I really enjoyed the battlegrounds in WoW and I would love to see something like that implemented. Instanced battlefields designed for CTF would be amazing.
---
Thanks, it's the first I've ever heard of or seen one, so I just assumed they snuck them in with this update. It's cool either way.
---
Gauley Mine is a great one too
---
Its both a dumpster fire and an amazing game could be the greatest game ever imo but it also has more issues then any game ever so its a love hate relationship
---
Armor &amp; PA are fixed but not sure about guns
---
Harpoon gun and other heavy weapons seem to be fixed.
---
They rolled back the patch
---
Crappy. Thanks. I just got a nice, legendary harpoon gun the day before the patch and now i cant get more than like 12 shots off before it breaks. A shame.
---
No. But seems they reverted the patch to the previous one so I guess if they were working before patch 16 it should work now.
---
I put in the name Joker? Is that my IGN? Or something else.
---
it is obtainable I just sold one. got it from a large holiday gift.
---
Spoilers, jeez...
---
How many people usually use that on a public sever like a lot of just one or two people usually?
---
We did want it to be something it will never be. We wanted it to be good. Please tell me what fallout feel is there? Is it the Vats? No that barely works. Nuclear Winter? Yeah New Vegas's battle royal was dope! They dialo... oh wait. If they are saying it has the feel only because its made on the same engine and looks similar then wowee Fallout 3 sure has that oblivion feel. The new perk system feels nothing like fallout, the building, while new and probably one of the only good things, feels nothing like fallouts, excluding fallout 4 because it too was garbo. This game, titled Fallout 76 should feel and play like fallout, but it doesnt, even the surival aspect of it sucks. Id like it if other players were actually a threat, but they are not, you have to accept a fight, and if not you take mirco damage and barely effects your health. Now it seems they are leaning into the Nuclear Winter shit, which is fine, but BR is not fallout, I had hope when Wastelanders was announced but oh look! its pushed back but ayyyye heres a new map for that shit mode.
---
Even found a legendary critter once, a long time ago...
---
If you want to buy it the game is pretty cheap right now. You can get it for like $20 on console.
---
Amazon had it for $12 a couple weeks ago but it’s spiked back up with the free trial.
---
The main chat is people from all servers, but it's not as busy as that sounds. You can also talk to people on your server or make a team. Like many chats, there are regulars (15-20 maybe), lurkers, and passers-by.
---
I've recently seen a lot of turrets go hostile after taking damage. It's like an autoimmune disorder.
---
just want to finish that damn scout badge, it's frustrating that they throw shit in the game without considering how bonkers it is to attempt to get the drop
---
Thank you. I just ran through and found 7 of them. 3 were out front before I went in.
---
Small Holiday Gifts:
---
Mounted beaver *giggle*
---
Mounted dog
---
Mounted cat
---
Mounted radstag
---
Holiday Gift
---
Plan: Combat Heavy Arms
---
I've been giving them some of the low level legendaries I've been getting and a outfit / water / stim and a vintage nukashine and let them figure it out haha
---
I've been in the mood to do anything in a week, maybe taking out some scorched will do some good.
---
I’ve had loads from there now.
---
Yeah, that's the last badge I have left and it's been driving me nuts.  I have spent more time in the ash heap trying to get the damn thing than I can count.
---
Really people should just get their priorities sorted out..
---
Fallout First 👍
---
Families only if game crashes 😜
---
But yes, definitely run the holiday Scorched until Santatron's batteries run down.
---
Turns out they're good at fixing bugs that benefit the players. It's only when they try to fix bugs that harm them that they make things exponentially worse...
---
No I enjoyed it :) Gave me a smile.
---
So, you finally captured Mad Dog Malone properly.
---
You're doing the lords work.
---
Yes, it is supposed to be better. 
---
Not sure why more people haven't complained about this... But the HDR used in this game is a "fake" HDR. It's not the worst, but it's definitely flawed in many situations. And as you pointed out, some area's are getting over exposed, and other's are getting crushed.
---
I've given up on expecting them to touch it though, as literally no one ever brings it up, and the few times I have, it's been ignored completely, even by us players.
---
Yeah 😂
---
U need 0 u just need a nuclear key card from a cargo not, use nukacrypt for the weekly code when launching
---
The final step fail miserably and i doesn't recieved items in game. But twitch prime say i've claimed it correctly.
---
If you're looking for Plasma Grenade plans then the medium handmade gifts are the best chance for it.
---
Oh so I don't need the codes just the key card
---
Bastards!
---
Killing Christmas scortched
---
It has been stuck for 3 weeks.
---
Honestly, I’ve been hoping for a unit you can place at your camp to initiation camp attacks. 
---
I would love to hold out in my base while enemies attacked from all sides!
---
Apparently they were around, just really rare encounters. Oh well, I've seen it with my own eyes now lol
---
I like this idea, lost count of the number of times I scrapped Teddy Bears I was wanting to put on display.
---
I vote legendary behemoth with Santa hat like above
---
 "Edit: While I'm on the front page; I don't think the Santatron is giving anyone presents, not a single one. "
---
That's what I thought at first but look in the compartment  at the back of the unit. I wasn't sure how it worked and kept looking at the terminal. He doesn't seem to do much but the gifts are there.
---
Just and FYI.  If you’re an Amazon Prime Member then you also get Twitch Prime for free.  I didn’t realize this until 10 mins ago.  I simply had to verify my Amazon Prime account with twitch and then link my new Twitch Prime account to Bethesda account.
---
I think it’s great considering I was already an Amazon Prime Member.
---
Lol i go around shooting people with it. It totally doesn't stay for 3 weeks
---
Whitesprings and Westek. 
---
Sleep, and go farm. Get like 300+ xp per kill, level up in no time.
---
OH. Then you might need to see a doctor. Or send in a ticket?
---
Don't forget to equip chemist for double the presents!
---
Where are the items deposited in game?
---
No they just get you the launch code, but if you look it up online then you can just punch it in.
---
Chameleon worked. Shotguns were ... weird. As usual. Some enemies would stagger and fall and let you shoot them to death without a whisper of complaint, and others would go, “WHAT WAS TGAT?!? A FLY?!? I THINK A FLY LANDED ON ME!!! OOH! OUCH!”
---
Will log in again tonight when I get home. Gotta make a new episode of my CAMP building series anyway...
---
I have
---
GODFARKINGDAMNED !  
---
There goes another Cup of coffe all across my screen.
---
Well played...….
---
The only thing I can say it... Don't get attached to your tamed pet, they die for fuckall reasons all the time lol.
---
Bethesda needs to just treat them like regular base items after being tamed, and let us either resurrect them upon death, or make them immortal.
---
Tamed pets don't really do anything for a camp anyway, besides look fucking cool. They die to anything and everything. They can't guard anything, be used as any type of defense or offense, and don't provide anything else... So just let us not be hassled with hunting for a pet for hours on end, just to end up with the same chore upon next login.
---
Ahh awesome thanks guys
---
In 1100+ hours I’ve seen exactly two of them.
---
Ahhhhhh! Clarity! Thanks!
---
I agree. It is a true pain in the ass to grind all of the random spawns but it gives me something to do.
---
I like it a lot.  Having scorched suddenly become valuable targets is getting me into locations I haven’t visited in months, if not close to a year.  I’m using the opportunity to freshen up my hunting grounds.  It makes the game feel new, or at least like a replay of a game I haven’t fired up in months.
---
I got the ultracite gatling, pipe automatic and laser medium scope plans so far.  I’d resigned myself to the idea that I’d never have those.  Great stuff!
---
I managed to do that once to a new dweller too. Went straight to the South of Savage Divide.   
---
He managed to reach White Springs though, so there is that.
---
Man that quad is absolute gold. Keep it! Put the auto mod on it and the deep dish and you have yourself a serious pocket magnum there. People straight up run away from quad gammas or they get melted.
---
My stuff showed up in game after about 10 minutes
---
I love this idea I can't wait to get on tomorrow (stuck visiting family right as the event starts! FML)
---
Yea I don't like the whole everyone has to be on your team before you can join the world &amp; if anyone wants to join after the everyone already on a team has to back out to the main menu.
---
If you eat the aid item, it lasts for 9999 days
---
The suit you can craft at the armor station. I haven't checked the others
---
Eh everyone has their playstyle. Some people wanna be more aggressive and some people just wanna hide the whole match. Do what you like.
---
Lol this has happened to me before.  I'm a "bush Whookie". I'll hide and survive.  There are pros and cons to both play styles bit to each his/her own.
---
I cannot remember the exact name, I think it was called Joe's burgers or something like that but
---
I have seen several foxes that hang out around the area, I'm not sure if you can tame them though
---
I always leave one outside 76 with some stimpaks and gear.
---
Well I'm a killer because I actually killed someone in the match. He didn't.  I think the difference is thinking strategic vs. being reckless.
---
Its pretty satisfying to be able to one-shot small enemies, and play Grandmother's Footsteps on more durable targets (high level Deathclaws, Sheepsquatches, etc). My approach is to switch out Long Shot 3 for Concentrated Fire 3 for rapid headshots in close quarters. It does get pretty stressful when hordes of enemies catch on, but that's part of the fun.
---
Yeah, Slocum Joe's. They're not tameable though.
---
Ok you convinced me op I'm returning to those blue ridge mountains
---
2 always spawn at point pleasent
---
I believe there is a whole lot of difference between bloodied build in PA and bloodied commando or melee without PA. If it comes to pvp i usually one shot bloodied guys without the armor. And i am full health rifle build.
---
Ah that sux
---
Exactly what I was thinking nice to be able to get them rare plans too 👍
---
Same here. I'll hide but fight as well. I prefer to see what they are working with before running head first into it.
---
They could do this for all the little holidays from now on.  Valentine day, St. Patricks day, Easter, 4th of July, etc. 
---
Also wouldn't mind if they changed up the enemies each time.  Have ghouls for one holiday, Supermutants, et.
---
Any dev that just puts a horde mode or battle royal mode in their games have no creativity left or doesn't want to risk trying something new and these Devs are a plague on the industry.
---
But I didn't hide the whole match. I don't think you read my entire post.  The real point is that he bragged about being a killer and killed no one.  He complained about me being a camper but actually killed.
---
I feel like the legendaries that aren't santa-ized are mistakes, like they just didn't finish thier transformation. Only other time I have seen em legendary is during the kill scorched community event.
---
I'm dressed as a pirate currently but have been doing the same. The new event is giving me lots of low level legendaries so I've been handing them to people rolling new characters &lt;3
---
I completely agree. I quite enjoyed mischief week and meat week was a blast as I had just started playing not long before that but this is very cool because we’re off exploring trying to find holiday scorch. And the rewards are awesome.
---
they're
---
They can fast travel back to their camp or Vault 76 so it really isn't a huge deal.  I have my camp set up near Flatwoods and was thinking about dusting off the old punchbowl this weekend. Lol!
---
Lol I'm not camper but I guess I'm no 'hunter' either cause I don't die like that.. wtf?
---
Hey same had a death claw, megasloth, hunter and the other was a guard dog that I found in the ash in the fork in the road by the Lewisburg Station. They die quick couldn’t keep them alive for more than a couple of sessions. The guard dog was killed like a second after I tamed it. I do t think there is away to keep them alive and makes the grind or perk points needed worth the trouble.
---
I'm liking this Christmas event
---
When we tried this, private server, we only got 2 santa scorched in about 12 spawn waves. We just moved on.
---
I’m not much of a collector (mounted heads) but like the Halloween event I can sell them for caps for other stuff. 
---
I did get a few rare plan drops too -armor and weapons related.  Primed auto handmade and several good raider and PA related items.
---
Those old time photo's are outstanding!  They would look great framed in someone's gamer cave.  How did you do it if I might ask?
---
Nice thought using the scorched event! Just need one to pop up and you are golden.
---
Did you have these issues before the hotfix today?
---
Thank you, SenyraInnov. Not a lot of Youtubers would put this much effort into sharing this with their gaming community. You rock.
---
is this on pc? i saw 200+ on ps4 nw last time i played it
---
I have crashes like everyone but I am now 5 for 5 for workshop defense missions
---
I consistently see Beth reps post on bug reports here on reddit. It's more likely that *they know* *already* and aren't just ignoring it to be dicks.
---
I love 76, there’s truly nothing else like it.
---
I'm a new player on fallout 76
---
Which system do you play on?
---
you're lucky, because i've made the link more than hour before lauching the game.
---
Yes going into the pro shop at WS and no gouls just angry robots is always a strange time.
---
They don't want to support deaf players communicating in game without a 3rd party system.
---
You really can't level fast in the game as a new player, it will take some time... But with 2x XP, it will be faster for these days.
---
Just go through the missions, learning about the world and how it came to be. Explore it. 
---
If you can, try not to fast travel too much, as you will end up feeling like you're just mindlessly going to places, instead of actually exploring.
---
You really wont get great gear until max leve, 50. Until then, just use what you like. If you find a weapon or playstyle that really grabs you, look up builds for that and you can start on the build early, saving you time end game on trying to get that build going.
---
Biggest thing really is... Just take your time to explore everything around you. There is good world building in all locations, and if you just run through things, you'll really end up doing yourself a disfavor due to missing out on what is there to draw you in.
---
Yes you'll get higher level gear.
---
I haven't had any luck in the tunnel, Santa didn't show up.
---
A lot of the plans are crazy rare, like before this event, people would trade a ton of stuff for just something like the "plasma grenade plan". But now, they're relatively common af. Also a decent amount of unique stuff, like the "Santa crash" plan or the "mounted mothman" plan. Lastly, you can get legendary scrip from the large presents but you'll get caps from any size of presents.
---
I wish, Outside reviving there is no difference, I sell base for 22, and Diluted for 10. I sold over 500 base before anyone touched my diluted.
---
OVN is my favorite
---
You can farm Morgantown airport hangars. Many of the first aid kits  have either stimpacks or disease cure.
---
Time to look for some better armor? 
---
Even at 157, I’m squishier than I prefer when I’m not in PA.
---
So does sony suck since its basically doing the same thing as microsoft? Lol
---
Just play. The “bad press” is just drama queens
---
Honestly just play the game. If you enjoy it get it. If not, then don't get it.
---
Just run around and explore, if you enjoy any of the other fallout games im sure you will like this one
---
I do not have very good luck with drops, getting drops is no problem, there all just trash
---
It's a fun way to spend time with my buds who don't live near me. And I find that grinding and farming is cathartic. It relaxes me
---
id buy it
---
Don't count on us to congratulate then for roll backing the fix of a day one bug due to it destroying the absolute whole endgame stuff.
---
I'm all for being open minded and positive thinkers but this would be pushing a little.
---
You’re completely right, this sub is horrid, however they do respond to like 3 posts of the 500 that say there’s a bug, so when they do so you never hear about it. Had you not seen any of the posts community managers responded to (which you probably didn’t cause they aren’t even the most upvoted posts) you wouldn’t have known things like how they were working on a hotfix for the armor bug and the santatron only collecting junk if you have the original one.
---
Just roam. Ignore levels, jusoak in the world. A year later I still find new things almost everytime I play. Welcome and good luck :)
---
Yeah, I'm going to run around in my sheepsquatch costume stealing presents.
---
This isn’t a complaint about 76, this is a complaint about Sony. Bethesda has 0 control over this facet of console gaming.
---
Between forums and tickets, their team knows before it’s on reddit, and if not before, it’s more valuable when seen somewhere else.
---
You’re correct
---
What does chemist add to other then drugs?
---
Yes.
---
Yes ffs please increase the camp budget!
---
I play online with friends everyday. Without a subscription to ps+
---
Does that answer your question?
---
I've found that the laser turrets don't seem to glitch like that. Only the standard and heavy gun turrets go haywire.
---
Reminds me of when the super mutants are looking for me and say "STOP HIDING" as I sneak around and pick them off one by one.
---
No, it's the actual gift box, like the large, normal, and small ones that you can open.
---
Yea WS clubhouse levels you fast. When i level up my mules I get 10 levels per day just from after work play, doing clubhouse nothing else, no xp boost. With double xp and if you play hard over the weekend you can probably level up 30 or more per day (just a rough estimate).
---
As someone who uses their mic... I wish some people wouldn't. I would love text chat because I am so tired of hearing people's screaming kids in the background... or people who don't know how to mute when they eat etc
---
Depends on where in the forest you are.  I‘m In the forest, but very close to the cliff you might call the divide/forest border, so sometimes I get L68 mutants or L40/50 wolves, along with the occasional SB and mothman.  
---
Farther to the west, have never seen anything remotely close to that high.
---
Lol! True
---
It's a free weekend across all platforms afaik... Lots of games have free weekends to draw in new players. Basic marketing.
---
Holy S**T it's expensive! Seriously Bethesda? You made it so to give gifts to other people we have to spend thousands upon thousands of caps?
---
After today’s patch I see way fewer santa than yesterday.
---
Or recipes that need boiled water why can't I use purified water?
---
Events, any missions you have left to do or the dailys, claim workshops. Find areas with lots of higher lvl enemies in a small space and just kill, kill, kill and remember anything that runs is XP and anything that stands still, is well trained XP.
---
It's been a while since I've been on so I forgot the name.
---
To the right of Monongah power plant where it shows says 95 has a motel where you link the beacons. While linking you face off waves of scorched. Wouldn't that be a great place to farm for the gifts?
---
Chain running events with lots of waves or server hopping and farming.  I'd recommend the farming with the scorched event going.  Find somewhere you like and clear then server hop and clear again.  
---
Make sure you sleep constantly so you always have the well rested buff for xp, eat cranberry relish to keep its xp buff up, and the event feed the people rewards cans of stew that also give an xp boost.  Believe that should be an extra 25% xp total.  That plus the 100% bonus xp should have you leveling at least once an hour if you stick to it.
---
The shadow prime should have cost 900 atoms and then they should have released a bundle with shadow prime, liberty prime, and patriot prime for a reduced amount of atoms like 2500 or so.
---
Agreed. Great event Beth, ty. Merry Xmas :)
---
Idk, I think it's completely random. Just keep looking.
---
Directly across from the overseer camp.
---
[Welcome to hell.](https://youtu.be/ZsNttTKCCMs)
---
I got a couple 2* drops in Poseidon. Nothing worth keeping but its a quick 30 scrip for later
---
And yet, here you are
---
Ya, even the rads I don't mind. The diseases are a pain though.
---
Seems to be settling down now after doing 3 more
---
I thought you were going to say perfectly preserved pie :)
---
They are just re skinned pumps. They dont give any purified water.
---
Right now I’d say server hop Big Bend Tunnel over and over again. The scorched inside level out you, so you’re not overwhelmed at lower levels, give decent XP and you’ll get a bunch of Scorchy Claus’s dropping gifts and Legendaries. 
---
If you can handle Scorchbeasts, add fissure hopping to that as well. They’re a huge XP dump and usually have waves of Scorched along for the ride. 
---
And don’t forget to boost your INT along with the regular XP buffs. Berry Mentats and Scorchbeast Brains will give you a nice boost that will help you level faster.
---
I don’t think the canned meat and cranberry foods stack. When I tried that, it replaced cranberry with the canned meat bonus.
---
Hoard events are great, as you can intentionally go to the wrong location, "search" it, and get 300+ xp, 4 times. Then there's killing the actual hoard, and a Legendary item at the end of it.
---
It is a decoration and a dirty water source you can put in your building for convenience.
---
You realize the topic your in right now is a playstation topic for fallout 76 right?....
---
A guy complaining about having to buy ps+ to play fallout76....
---
Well yesterday i stayed in one location just to see how frequent they spawn, there was one almost every time i server hopped. Today same location it’s down to one every 4-5 server hops, so i only got a handful out of two dozen tries.
---
This is legitimately the first time I've read anything positive about Bethesda support.
---
Primal Cuts in Cranberry Bog when it glitched and spawned more enemies than normal reminded me of a horde mode.
---
Mine too!! As long as the one-shotters slow their roll! I use my shittiest weapon and just vats tag each one to give others a chance and we all win!
---
Apparently anywhere with alot of scorched has one legendary in a christmas outfit!
---
Tonight when everyone gets off work is when it will start was the plan I think. I know ill launch a couple this weekend most likely.
---
I don't remember the stat changes. BUT, it teleports you to "random" location.
---
Thank you! I preordered the game but was so disappointed on release I’m not even level 20, it seems like I should get back into it but the main quest seems very skewed towards team play and I’m usually alone
---
Yea the downside is it’s level 15! Lol. I had a max level one that I sold for 2k because I didn’t know how useful they are for pvp. I have 2 two shots with the signal repeater and man they crank out the rays!!!
---
I did it for the first time yesterday, and it literally gave me a 3 star straight up
---
i don't remember where I found it but what a ride. Would like to jump on that bike a gin when I came out of those tunnels i was lost for at least one hour  🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Very cool thanks for the info
---
it might be faster just to make a new character.  Especially with 2x xp you can get to 50+ fast.
---
Coming next Atom Shop update...
---
I didn’t use relish; I just used the basic cranberry recipe. Maybe that’s why.
---
you know, because Bethesda ALWAYS follows though with things they say. so sure, lets get all upset and hyperbolic about something that hasn't happened yet and just assume that everyone agrees with me.
---
If you don't enjoy the grind, you won't enjoy the endgame.  So yeah based on your op I doubt this is a good game for you.
---
I mean at this rate any integration of some quality of life updates, through 1st or otherwise would be a welcome reprieve.
---
Seen the pied piper eye bot a few times, that's cool. An eyebot playing a flute and floating along, followed by a long line of rats.
---
I dunno I get plenty of small gifts from 68 santa scorched.  
---
Gonna nuke morgantown this weekend and see if it changes the outcome :)
---
try hunting before you call the other guy out :P
---
That's usually how it works, yes.
---
The rads should be the same regardless of level, that’s what I go for.
---
Just another Salty troll.
---
Are you and your friend online now?
---
Everyone in this thread realises that the engine itself wouldnt be able to handle it right? Go build a massice settlement in Fallout 4 and see how fuckey the engine starts to act and you'll see why they cant really increase it much more in this game.
---
I use to have 5 turrets (laser, missile, machine gun, etc), and slowly removed them one by one until now my camp is defenseless. I've found you don't really need turrets at your camp
---
Don't the downvotes actually show the opposite? That there are enough people that disagree with you enough to bother downvoting?
---
The sub is actually pretty balanced. I would give it almost 50/50 for and against.
---
Found 4 level 2s in a team at the vault. Gave them each an extra nukashine from my present farming. The sheer evil ecstasy i got from watching them all head to a different corner of the map was startling.
---
The dude who landed near bog town must have taken it the worst.
---
You buy it at various train stations I think and it's used to craft holiday presents, which can give you insanely high tier plans
---
So basically, if it happens, it happens, but it's not likely to be lucrative enough to be worth a griefer's time, I guess.
---
Ngl, this event is what made me finally cave and get Fallout 1st. I’m getting so much cool shit, that I need the extra space. Plus, it’s nice exploring for all the holiday scorched in a lag-free server.
---
It’s just like the other person said but think of opening them like turning in a treasure map. You never know what’s in it.
---
I do run power armor
---
Yeaah didn't think it'd be this difficult ive gotten to launch prep but there's an assualtron invader kicking my arsed and those turrets are annoying
---
Why? There's an icon on the lower right that shows what effects you have active.
---
They don't need to accomodate AFK'ing.
---
The recipe's wouldn't taste right without Appalachian water
---
The problem is players are buying the wrap because they want the plans and/or caps from it, but there would be no need to buy them anymore when they got all of them. The wrap must provide items  that a player would need/want all the time otherwise they wouldn’t buy it.
---
That's one of the cryptid quests 😉
---
I gave a lvl 7 a nukashine, with no context provided. I hope that where ever they are, they’re okay and still playing the game.
---
Yes they do spawn on private worlds.
---
Agreed. Thanks for the contribution to this thread!
---
Disconnected from server
---
There are **multiple** people on XB 300+, already. 299 is small potatoes.
---
I like playing the mode, but there are other things to do.
---
Right? I dont understand what people are looking to get out of threads like this.
---
No presents, but a bunch of coal so I'm guessing my Santatron just thinks I've been bad this year. By the way, what can the coal even be used for?
---
I don't know that you can level up from 1 using heavy. I mean you can spec for it, just don't remember actually GETTING any heavy weapons until the 30's. 
---
Gonna try stealth mode with regular armor on the next guy.
---
There's also a vendor at Grafton in a medical tent. Random spawn robot that appears at Sutton Station and a vendor at Camden Park that I can think of right now
---
Not for ff14 online
---
A ton. An absolute ton of caps just left the world. This is great for the economy.
---
I use it for a certain serum recipe.
---
The value of the wrap is increased by its time limits though. It’s creates a scarcity which makes it worth spending on. If it were permanent there wouldn’t be urgency so it wouldnt work the same, in the long run.
---
Found the comment I was looking for. This is exactly it. People complain that the game is buggy now, I can only imagine how buggy it would be if camp budgets were increased.
---
But there aren't any bushes you can hide in.
---
I just fill my punchbowl with it. Enjoy f*ckos
---
This is what happens when the devs give us agency. Instead of jumping to the same event every 30 minutes (which means we can't choose to do a time-consuming activity as long as we want to the the event), we can pick our way to play the game. Sure we farm the scorched, but we do it in existing locations that already contain scorched. Do we just run in, scan for the santas and run out if there are not any? Or do we clear the area for XP and materials? Do we connect it with caps farming so that we can buy the ribbons for homemade presents? Everyone can choose his way to use the scorched santa mechanics and it feels soooo refreshing...
---
Wow, today I learned. Thanks for responding!
---
Yeah you missed the band wagon a few days ago bud
---
What a helpful answer. Thank you
---
You're like Hitler. But even Hitler cared about Germany,or something. /s
---
Lol.
---
go to blackwater mine, collect all the guns &amp; stuff, and drop it on the vendor.  Usually 800-1000 caps worth of stuff, especially after uranium fever.
---
I use me best weapon, my bloodied handmade. I just pop a bunch of rad-away and it's like David Banner instead of the Hulk. I love sharing the kills. You know when the group is good that it's going to be a good haul.
---
I just signed up for 1 month to see how it was... is this a constant problem or can u get it to work eventually
---
Not everyone realizes you can MAKE the gifts from wrapping paper and tinkers work bench. Using chemist perk gets you 2 instead of one for some reason...(so glad todays fixes didn't fix that !!) I've been making every quality I can afford. 
---
I opened the first gift I found yesterday and 3 other people dropped me for some cool plans .. but have been hording them now. Where are people finding the most Large/holiday gifts?
---
I believe Bethesda posted something on support page FAQ. Check there and if not search forum here. I know I read something somewhere.
---
It's not fait and it wont change. Let me make an assumption and say they are all in vacation mode and the skeleton crew of... well now that I think about it the skeleton crew of interns may be more apt to face the challenge than the regular employees
---
Been playing since beta, soloing 99% of the time
---
Likely after this loot drop ends. Start of february or so
---
If you liked Fallout 4 at all, then you’ll probably like 76. 
---
It’s Fallout 4 with friends. And you can finally show off your “settlement” builds; they’re just called camps now.
---
Ive gotten a couple 2 star, low levels from the fissure site by whitesprings and morgan town
---
Off scorched. The point is that the Santatron isn't doing what it's supposed to.
---
You would be surprised how few people know now to do a public event and play nice.  I was doing Uranium Fever the other day and one other person joined, about lvl 140.  They stayed off in one room.  I kept tagging the legendary and waiting for the player to come get it, and they wouldn't!  I ended up having to kite each of the legendaries back into the room they were camping in.  It just stood out as me as being odd, for a higher level player.
---
Well the character name only shows up for you.   Everyone else will see you by your Bethesda Account name, or 'In-Game-Name'...  so whatever your Bethesda account name is, is how people can find you in-game.
---
My feedback:
---
* power patcher is unnecessary. PA has amazing durability and you can easily farm improved repair kits via events and simply never worry about repairs, ever. I'd probably ditch that and pump up power user, you won't ever have to go hunting cores and your income from just finding them in the game will be more than you consume unless you main a gat laser (and even then might be ok).
---
* only 1 rank of chem fiend, is this meant to be a junky build? If so I'd probably find a way to get that maxed.  In not then this is an odd perk to slot in and probably not worth the rank.
---
* I think you're biggest oversight is you don't have anything for mutations.  starched genes + class freak are essential imo.  I'd lose pharma, luck of the draw, and scrounger plus maybe shift a couple ranks out of some other special.  str has some unnecessary food build perks :P
---
* Your entire perception tree is a trainwreck.  I'd proably just slot in 3 ranks for glow sight and you can situationally slot in those others.
---
Having said all of that these are mostly nitpicks aside from my comment about luck/mutations I think the build has good bones.
---
Obviously you'll sell base. Dilute em! 4x the yield.
---
Thanks, I’ll try this next time I’m on
---
I can practically hear the "Oh fuck" chanting as they try to run for safety lol
---
Devious
---
Progression is great, not seen this communion since Fasnacht. Share, Swap. Glorious.
---
Huh, this place doesn't se-  *Deathclaw Roar*
---
Light bulbs will forevermore have priority
---
Lol downvoted by fanboys for being right. Its better than nothing. Equivalent of a handjob from a hooker. I wear these downvotes with pride fuck bethesda
---
Your parents weren't there for you.
---
Everyone run I do there does well for me on drops.
---
You are lying to yourself than
---
A number of the load screen tips are somewhat legacy.  Like the one that talks about how Iron Fist has a crippling property.
---
When will the video be out ;)
---
No the people who would have upvoted have left. Active users are way down and post hardly hit 1k these days.
---
Sure, in time, you are correct.  But it still makes caps more valuable in general.  Existing players have a new sink and new players have an even larger sink as most if not all the plans are available at npc vendors.
---
Yup. I even posted a highly successful suggestion with1.2k upvotes 2 days ago. You think im just a shill but i call it like i see it. Bethesda is shit and greedy and the community is pretty cool. I am only subbed for random idea posts and wastelanders updates
---
The turrets are the worst for me too. I think there might be a terminal where you can turn them off tho
---
Hard to get to 140 without doing public events, so who knows... I've seen low levels park off in the corner to gain the event XP without having to plink away at the baddies, but yeah, odd for such a high level to coat tail it like that.
---
It was an atom shop item that isn’t available right now afaik
---
How about more than 150 scrip per day?  Tired of sitting on 300lbs of junk legendaries, esp with this event passing them out like candy.
---
When  did It come out
---
A level 2 might not know about fast traveling yet. Anywho... I keep my punchbowl polished and stocked but no one seems to check it lolol
---
There is a toggle option at the select screen below the private server option that is either Team only or All friends. Team only you have to invite people BEFORE you start server. Hope this helps.
---
My favorite is when they message you and tell you that youre shit, but the only reason they know is because they are dead and watching you. Lol.
---
I have before on xbox often, I would send a invite and that wouldn't work. So I would have them log into a public server, then enter my a server. 
---
Had a issue when i switch characters and it wouldn't let me back in my own private world. Saying I'm not friends or its full. Enter a public won't fix it but closing the game, creating a new private then.... it tosses you back in your OLD server with friends. If you ever have this issue you now know a fix.
---
This is true, though most I get are 1 Star.
---
Also a responder bot in the flatwoods church
---
What you have here  looks pretty solid.  
---
Without Starched Genes in Luck I assume you do not use mutations.  
---
There are a few things I would change however.   I would drop Pack Rat and Traveling Pharma for a 3\* Bullet Shield, or Blocker.  These will make you more tanky.  1\* pack rat and traveling pharma are minimal reductions at best.
---
I would also drop Power User and Power Patcher for Demo Expert 5 instead of 1, this will increase your DPS a considerable amount.  As a non mutant, you will need all the extra you can get.     Power Patcher is really unnecessary as Power Armor degrades so slow (I have been wearing the same suit of x-01 since february, and I have only had to fix it twice).  Power User is really only necessary if you plan on running lots of Vats and/or a Jetpack all the time.
---
I would also drop PharmaFarma and Scrounger for Luck of the Draw 3.  Once you start getting a few more levels and a comfort level in the new build you will find you have too many chems.  Especially if you run alot of events.
---
Or drop PharmaFarma and Scrounger for Starched Genes and run a few helpful mutations like Marsupial and Speed Demon (really helps with reloading heavies).  Of course this would mean you should also pick up class freak.   I would drop OGA for this.
---
As an explosive weapons user, its also a great idea to pick up a point or 2 in Fireproof.
---
Those are my thoughts, take them how you will.  But overall you are going in the right direction with your build
---
Ohhhhh I didn’t think of that! Interesting...
---
