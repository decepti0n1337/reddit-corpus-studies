Yeah. We'll just have to see if Bethesda sticks with the game and makes it actually worth playing to other people. Who knows maybe Wastelanders will attract a large amount of people to come and try the game again if it's good and doesn't suck at launch.

Also, the scout mask clips annoyingly through the top of a green hood, and I have to remove/equip my leather coat every time I load into a world to make my hands visible.
---

---
The Forest scout mask can‚Äôt be worn with a hat or helmet, but the urban version can.  I‚Äôd much rather use the Forest colorway.

No that's a separate issue. I want long weapons to have longer range than short weapons.

Was this a Strange Cake? What flavor was it exactly ü§î
---
Interesting. In the off chance he had a fuck ton of grenades then maybe he was legit. Nothing was legit about dude walking under water then shooting me with a handmade.
---
I was tired when I read this earlier lol sorry.  Well if you are an adult and want help with things I also am on ps4.  Im an over nighter and early morning player though.  If it fits your play time  lemme know est.
---
If you want more pointless inflation math about things in the fallout universe you should go to [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/falloutlore/comments/dpn5gc/what_cause_pre_war_currency_to_inflate/). The subject of Fallout inflation is quite a common one.
---
I agree, I liked the passive mods you could enable in FO4 with a switch and then everything in the camp is just powered. I kinda like my spider nest of wires now since I've grown accustomed to them.

Im not disagreeing with you.  Tesla guys are frustrating, but I can respect it because that‚Äôs how the gun works.  They‚Äôre not cheating or glitching anything.  If there wasn‚Äôt a damage cap, it‚Äôs not that great of a gun.  Given how easy it is to hit the limit, they‚Äôre just exploiting a hole in the rules to great effect.
---
I‚Äôm not huge on pvp these days, so I don‚Äôt even know how to fight a Tesla user.
---
I prefer vats crit fighting, but only because my build is a commando and I have a good vats crit radium rifle and handmade.   If I land a Q/FFR tesla, I‚Äôll surely try out what all the fuss is about.
---
To keep people paying and to get new people to play the game and possibly pay monthly
---
I still see a bright light for 76. Sure it's shining through a dirty window pane, but they really have made vast improvements since the B.E.T.A. I think they will definitely share some wasteland content. Hopefully a video of a vault dweller walking somewhere we are all familiar with, and then it shows an NPC and they start going through a dialog tree, then it just flashes to a montage and they just show a bunch of new NPCs in areas we've been too
---
1500-2000 with my bloodied meathook with no chems &amp; 20% health
---
No actually the gun is bugged it had multiple ticket about put in when the bolt arks it ignore defensive properties and treats as environmental damage like fire or gas
---
I have WR armor and have also modded it for pockets or deep pockets.  Have the standard Tadpole  backpack.
---
15 Str, weight reduction perks.  Marsupial and speed demon.
---
Last I tested, I loaded a bit over 1300# on my char, and was still able to run.  Yea, it burns AP, but I can do it.
---
In Excavator, I can go up to about 1750 before I hit the crawl/run cutoff. Non excavator PA cutoff is 1420.
---
Downside: the DR on the WR armor I have is less than excavator, so I‚Äòm squishier than I like.
---
one could argue that marsupial is best overall, for everyone, being able to jump up on a roof to safety and sheer utility, but I guess the OP was asking for damage mutations and I have to agree with the adrenal/twisted people :-)
---
No, a mega camp would be most likely separate from an normal camp, just like how their is a mini camp (Fallout 1st only though) there would be a mega camp, and their would be building requirements needed, like maybe 1000 wood, 500 glass, 200 steel, and 15 to 40 ultracite scraps. if you were to log onto a server solo, the mega camp would break down back to a normal camp, as i previously stated in the the OP, the Mega CAMP's would be a combination of up to 4 camps. so basically if all 4 of you are on the same server, it would be at its full potential, but if there was only 2 players, it would be only half of its full potential size. and honestly, i don't know if i should trust the game.   
---
Mega camps are an optional part, but basically you can withdraw from a mega camp at anytime, taking the things you built back with you. i feel like getting consent from a 4th player would be crucial, as obviously we would want as many options available to players as possible. Hopefully cleared it all up! (Honestly though it doesn't really matter at this point, this post is like a month old and hasn't got any attention to it. &lt;Also sorry for the month delay, got a switch and have been grinding SSBU&gt;)
---
fuzzy mining helmet works also.
---
I don't think any game I've ever played ever had good customer service, so that isn't news to me unfortunately. I did end up getting the higher quality bag shipped to me and it wasn't too painful. No one even tried to steal my identity! lol
---
Doesnt seem to work 100% of time
---
Very cool. Happy belated birthday!
---
Yeah, might as well delete it, topic has probably already been covered with the exact same idea and as well, most likely won't be implemented, fallout 1st already buried my interest in this games development along side my enjoyment. on top of that, bethesda game developers don't exactly care about the little guys opinion at this point... ive been cucking to bethesda for the past year, i'm done for now.
---
Lol ok kid
---
You can add me BEllis300
---
I‚Äôm on US ET
---
No kidding.  Is that why it does so much damage?  I just assumed it was anti armor, furious or some other effect.  I had a quad for a while, back when nuking the Whitespring was common, and thought the DPS was lackluster.  Between that and the damage cancel bug, I I haven‚Äôt used one since.  The AA/FFR/Reload I have in the stash might be worth something.
---
We even tried nuclear winter and it gave us the same thing.
---
Wrong answer.  How do you deal with a wanted player if pacifist is locked?  How do you do hunter/hunted?  How do you steal a workshop?
---
If you're standing in front of the hut door facing it, turn left to look at the lake.  On the far western side, where the old access road led down into the pit, there's two green potties.  They're up against a small cliffside.
---
LMK if that helped.
---
Cowboy camp, doing a cowboy build and need some ideas
---
You know you could block him and it's be over.
---
Also, he doesn't have your IP so he won't be able to DDOS you, much less figure out where you live.
---
But yes, take any evidence you have (if any) and report him, maybe they'll do something about it.
---
This completed for me shortly after logging on today. Funny thing, I was alone in private world, and NOT drunk. Saw it complete and checked. Moped, neither. Lol
---
Last years Xmas items.
---
Are you saying an AA tesla is valuable?  I thought the Q/FFR version was the big ticket everyone was after.
---
RNG be like that sometimes.
---
Ohh.. i had it wrong, i thought you had to get 20  creatures drunk and kill your team üëÄü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I first noticed this at a workshop I took over.  One turret showed red and attacked another near it.  Then it happened yesterday at my camp.  I hadn't run into this bug for quite awhile.  I wonder when it was put back in?
---
Oh I thought you said you had a quad my fault but the big ones are guad faster fire rate and two shot faster fire rate
---
Did you play Nuclear Winter first?
---
Apparently challenges auto-complete with no reward if you do.

I've never seen a pipistrelle, or a common horseshoe.

No melody larkin is the only responder body you can't find , its possible she survived and they don't even mention,how she died

oh sorry, you mean the overseer.  yeah i really hope so too
---
You‚Äôd think they would make some sort of mechanism that pops up like a tiny hole or connector or something that could automatically pop up wherever the wire is intersecting or passing through the wall.
---
People always compare ESO and 76 despite the fact that they're dramatically different games.
---
A lot of what works in ESO isn't gonna work for Fallout 76.

Santa, Ms. Claus and Elf outfits along with Antler headpiece.
---
Edit: oh and yeah that PA skin, forgot cause I don't wear PA and didn't buy that.
---
I'm excited to find out hiw these groups live on , raiders is self explantory but the Brotherhood and enclave would be interested because story wise everyone in those groups died
---
Highest I have ever seen was a 38k power attack
---
I usually just run it up and over the wall with the conduits
---
Well, duh.
---
Unless it‚Äôs about the enclave don‚Äôt make it political. It‚Äôs a game- enjoy it or don‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt care about trump.
---
Did the queen n she wasnt even a legendary. Seems to happen after I've had my lobby open for awhile .

---
Aside from the bouncing damage, I think the dealbreaker was the reload.  Just let me load all 8 shells.  I don't want to load one, shoot it and go through the initial and finishing animations for reloading every time.  It's just so painfully slow.
---
On the plus side, an explosive shotgun with Enforcer makes all the difference in the world in V94.  The end fight of Dead in the Water is ridiculously easy if every ghoul and mirelurk is completely crippled.  I don't think I could rush through the reactor section without being able to put a stopper on mob waves.  I just wish my AA/E pump could go through more than 50 shells without breaking.
---
My stuff last forever still
---
I'd settle for just being able to loot the queen.  Twice now I've gone to fight her and been left without loot.  I know there is a minimum damage amount needed to get loot, but I don't know how two mini nukes, two dozen missiles, and a butt load of various other munitions isn't enough damage.  This is seriously demoralizing me.
---
Sorry to piggy back, I didn't want to make a thread complaining when I just needed to vent.
---
People compare the two because they seem similar and in a sense kinda are.
---
People who think they're similar haven't played both of them.
---
[removed]
---
Very believable buff OP.
---
Really?  I noticed that was a giant pain in the ass while leveling Grandma.  I'd have to stop at just about every bench to repair my gun.  I used pump and combat shotguns, never a double barrel.  Even repairing to 150% and using 3 gunsmith, the pump just breaks stupidly fast.  The durability bar is maxed out, too.  The combat isn't much better.
---
I'm INT heavy so that's why I don't run the hops. Is there a way to negate the INT debuff?
---
Had that exact thing happened about an hour ago. Played like 3 or 4 matches back to back then that exact thing happened to me too restarting 76 didn‚Äôt help so I just turned on Netflix. Xbox one
---
SBQ has immunity to explosive damage, so your two mini nukes and two dozen missiles are just some nice fireworks in the battle, tbh
---
Exactly, the same for me, I think this is another frustrating bug.
---
I am not saying he's not, but people please insert the source when telling any news in any sub.
---
Agree to disagree
---
There's Mountainside Bed and Breakfast that usually always has one.
---
Look it up.. it's been happening to a lot of people the past few months. You gotta leave your game closed for a extended period of time so it creates a new lobby. It really sucks
---
Love the recessed doorway. Might have to do that for my next camp!
---
brought to you by fallout 1st
---
Agreed.
---
My spot for addictol(and the reason I need it) is Big Al's Tattoo Parlor.
---
I would find this a lot of fun myself. I would love to see player built towns. Given the setting of the game, it would only be natural that groups of survivors would eventually seek each other out &amp; start building organized settlements for their mutual benefit.
---
How does that affect the game and my game play?
---
KoreyAllen  and MoirasBioticPee  are mine!
---
Im always up for playin with new people!
---
.50 is where it' at! 
---
"Git sum! Git sum!"
---
The one that looks like a Klingon Bird of Prey?
---
The best way to get them is from other players.  Certain events like Uranium Fever rewards them if you are super lucky.
---
I put the forceful stock on all of mine doubles the condition bar and used gunsmith 5 id repair my stuff m aybe every 3 to 4 days basically every 3000 shells for me
---
I am watching Break Point, so be patient.
---
They should just add walls that transfer electricity and have snappable outlets. Like the exact same as the vault walls from the Fallout 4 DLC.
---
When there is more effort put into a cake then a AAA game. Anyway sweet cake.
---
Not to much I to camps myself but if theres playerbase to support it then absolutely. 
---
Fallout has so much potential if it gets more sandboxy.
---
It turned my gunslinger into a god of death. I totally recommend it. There is food and water everywhere.
---
As terrible and lonely as it sounds, I would love to just have my own private server I can build multiple buildings in, ya know? Make a small town and invite my friends to build stuff as well and use the entire server as a settlement. 
---
Ugh, I can dream
---
I was on a server when the game first came out, did the scorch queen battle with the entire server and for some reason our damage was nerfed to the point where hundreds of rounds wouldn't make a blip on her health, even the crazy explosive or two shot weapons barely dented her... and this was BEFORE they were nerfed. We got her to half health as the event ended and we decided we had already spent all that time when she got to full health again that we might as well continue. I dont know how the event normally ends when you can't finish her off, but I SWEAR the fight lasted an additional 30 minutes, down to my last stimpack, out of radaway and a glitched boss with 10X the health of a standard scorchbeast queen. We all pulled together and managed to finish her off wasting THOUSANDS of hard earned rounds of ammunition and we celebrated for a quick second. Of course the drops were terrible, but it was by far the most challenging thing I had done all of the game, and nothing has come close since, and I am A OK with that shit lmao
---
Class freak and counter it with a strange in numbers if you have friends...and egghead....and heard mentality
---
I go to Abbie's and vats. 70 percent of the time I find one.

Plant a bunch of corn, and make corn soup. Will satisfy food and water. Plus faster ap regen...
---
Why do people use the .50 cal over the Gatling gun? It has better fire rate but the Gatling gun has so much more damage it makes up for it, and the ammo for the Gatling gun is cheaper. 50 cal also eats through ammo much faster than the Gatling gun
---
What we wanted:  A simple wall pass through that you can attach to on either side.
---
What we received:  Weird pipe things that never seem to snap the way you want them to.
---
Happy late birthday
---
Yeah, i have a stealth commando build but I just got a zealots minigun to use on her. 5mm ammo is way cheaper to make than 5.56.
---
Not even had it once but I keep trying
---
I made a video a while back about detaching foundation from ladders.
---
https://youtu.be/2JamYdpY0YA
---
After detaching the foundation, just add floors in place of the foundation.
---
Game crashes during queen...put on new server. Trying to server hop or find a world where you can place your camp...same server 5 times in a row. Drives me nuts some days.
---
Hey man, a long as you're there (in the event) you'll get the xp and rewards, which is nice.
---
Also, players will see how many people are participating. So with you being there, players may actually join just to have comaradery
---
VATS is far from essential. High RoF weapons still have a solid TTK even if the opponent is decked out in solid gear and nearly everyone carries a Quad Gamma to burn tanks. If your entire build is shut down by a Stealth Boy, then you have a bad build. VATS should be disabled in adventure as in NW.
---
As for Teslas, the best defense is Cola Nut + Quantums imo. Does an okay job, but Teslas need a nerf. I'm inclined to agree with your perspective on legacies as well, but these are totally different conversations than SBs.
---
Lol! Luck of the RNG. I did it about 12 times before it dropped for me, but I‚Äôve done battle bot about 300 times and still don‚Äôt have the plasma plans..
---
What do you mean?
---
Ty well done puttin this out no /s. Something to know.
---
I know, too bad we have to pay for it right now. Maybe in the future it can be a reality, I'm sure loading into a private single server is much easier on your game than a standard server, but I dont have any idea if fallout 1st private world players are having just as many crashes as a player on a normal server does
---
If I'm on a private world and I get those notifications, it's generally my internet connection. 
---
If you get server not responding on a public server it usually means someone is trying to dupe. 
---
I'm on Xbox as well.
---
I hope you saved that 1* drop and have it on your new display because it sounds like you earned it .üòÜ
---
Yea I'm all about the what most of us want for sure, and a huge amount of fallout fans traditionally enjoy the creative side of the worlds provided, just as much as the competitive and PVP side that has been introduced. I still haven't tried nuclear winter but that's because I haven't learned enough about it.
---
Did they die or did they hide?
---
I was messing with my vendors and some level 15 guy comes in there and starts whacking me with a sledgehammer. I let him be at first but since it was starting to annoy me I turned around and shot him.
---
Well, he had 2 level 200+ guys with him waiting for that exact thing to happen. Camp was gone in seconds.
---
Honestly the gatling gun is solid at range
---
This is exactly what I was thinking as I traveled through the various faction locations and learned how the responders and brotherhood for example worked together for the betterment of the community, and I think a LOT of us would be down for factions helping factions. Of course thats an ENTIRELY different story lol
---
Damn. That is a menu. I'll try it. Thanks!
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
One of the new updates
---
Ah ok thank you
---
Np
---
Fairly often. I play solo, and there's really only so much you can do versus an entire group. You can still win with a bit of strategy and luck, though.
---
Just yesterday I took on a group 3 to 1 at Charleston Landfill. One was using primarily a handmade. The other 2 alternated between explosive lasers and teslas. I took them all on and won decisively. Cola Nut + Quantums goes a long way towards tanking teslas, and a Quad gamma gun's AoE helps combat stealth effects. They only got me twice. Both times almost immediately after my Stealth Boy expired with VATS. Wound up hitting max caps thanks to them. Gotta spend 'em.
---
Crouching is a nice tool, but it costs you mobility so it's a bit of a tradeoff. It's also not too hard for your opponents to spray and pray until they tap you, opening you to a VATS attack. I'm a bit biased here, to be fair. Most of my PvP is versus multiple attackers. With enough fire coming at you, crouching doesn't help much.
---
It was my birthday yesterday too! Happy birthday! That cake is the best! ‚ù§
---
I can‚Äôt believe dozen donuts costs that same as a salad in the fallout universe (according to a note in portside pub)
---
I make ammo pretty easily and love the .50 quick murder rate. I have never tried the gatling. I will try tonight.
---
Marsupial.
---
Or you know, pay month by month and cancel when you get bored
---
I use cola nut and quatums ive never been able to tank the shot they usally kill me before dodgy even works
---
What are they worth  I have both of them (pc)
---
Then you wouldnt have the cool break in the chain effect when something kills a power connector that goes to turrets. 
---
That said, fuck chains. That system takes way too much engine power considering each check for power repeats to everything else down the line, just connect two terminals  in a large loop and watch as your game freezes for about a full 3 seconds as it figures it out. 
---
All for an annoying effect that doesnt matter because people arent attacking each others bases at all, only trash mobs? Yeah lose that shit. Save some server computes for everyone. Good concept, impossible execution.
---
Don‚Äôt let the fire rate fool you, it‚Äôs glitched and it says 400-500 but it‚Äôs not actually that high.
---
My internet is the best I can get and I can play other games like payday 2 and things of that nature with no issues so I don‚Äôt know what I can do now.
---
FYI, save 1000 scrip, learn the plan at the vendor, then drop 1000 in one go, then another 150, 
---
2 people (myself being one) have both got bloodied bear arms with swing speed this way, mine was 5th attempt at 2*
---
Enclave was killed off completely by modus and brotherhood died on a suicide missions
---
this was after i put everything back up, when you stand far enough from the wall you can see the cat flickering under the wallpaper.
---
Not sure why that is. Teslas deal pretty low damage compared to handmades and lasers in my experience. My build is very tanky, so maybe it's just me. Between stims and colas, I can stand fire from teslas for several seconds. Usually long enough to kill them first, but it varies.
---
That's how previous Fallout games that let you play past the ending are.  Enclave are still in the Capital Wasteland after they lose, they're just stragglers.  Same in Fallout 4 where you run into pockets of BoS/Railroad/Synth remnants occasionally depending on who you killed.  
---
Otherwise it'd kind of suck if you couldn't fight certain enemies or get certain loot anymore.  The other option is to not let you play anymore and just do a slideshow that says 'and all the other people left" like New Vegas, but that's unsatisfying to not get to play post credits
---
i mean yeah don't get me wrong the cake looks nice but i guess some people don't like the truth
---
I would never support Fallout First, and truth is, the procedure is equally annoying: in, dump, out, 
---
log in, loading times, etc.
---
To add to it, maybe brightness variations as well? Right now the only two options are phone screen or the sun.
---
They can currently only drop from the chest at the end of the first vault raid. For whatever reason the chest uses loot tables from an old loot pool, that's why it was still dropping drills. However instead of updating its loot pool, they just removed drills lol
---
You can do a lot with other 50 cals
---
That's true
---
Thanks for that info, was thinking I was just being unlucky, do you know why they was removed from the loot table ? All come to mind when I was speaking to someone about the tse nurf
---
That dude must have dropped fat STACKS on the atom shop, the Christmas bundles last year were scary expensive

---
It was indeed a single star legendary... and a nocturnal rolling pin to boot lmao. The fight was hell, I dont know why any of us stayed to fight it. It was like the group of us became the immovable object vs the unstoppable force that was the scorchbeast queen
---
Right, Explosive was supposedly still bugged on the Dragons. So they were like Legacies in that they had ridiculous amounts of damage. Tbh I'm tempted to ask about the old TSEFR version in trade channels
---
I never go without it. The increased hunger and thirst is a minor drawback to faster movement and reload. You can easily get water with the purifiers and I usually check Sunday Brothers' Cabin in the locked basement for food. The shooting range area right in front of Top of the World also spawns a fair bit of food. Or just have carnivore/herbivore and eat raw meat/plants.
---
Also, I have purified water set to 0 on my favorites wheel. Just spam it every once in a while.
---
I found the pond outside lucky hole mine is good, with a random encounter spot so you get mothman, flatwoods monster etc nearby, 
---
my camp is currently at white springs Just off the path between the golf course and the first set of ‚Äúhouses‚Äù and I get a lot of foot traffic in sales and the enemies tend to stay put and never really have to repair my camp other then when I nuke it
---
Cool man hope you have a awsome birthday
---
I think 4K damage was standard with perk cards on the tse one iirc, I‚Äôve got a lvl 35 ze on my mule and now I‚Äôm thinking about a bloodied one, I never knew the damage was broken on them, but then again a lot of weapons was majorly unbalanced until about patch 5/7 I‚Äôd say
---
Just to be able to nuke whitesprings and then farm all the 3*‚Äôs to yourself at the price of the atoms, then yes, and the scrap box is a nice feature, don‚Äôt expect much from cosmetics, we have had the same armor just different colours
---
Ive tried it to the longest live for is like 4 seconds
---
It‚Äôs awarded as an atomic shop item. You couldn‚Äôt sell it no matter how many you had since it‚Äôs atomic shop.
---
Enclave events can reward them and so can uranium fever that‚Äôs it! Otherwise u have to trade with players for them. I think that‚Äôs it
---
you shouldn't be going into a nuke zone (or terribly near one) without appropriate protection, a hazmat suit at the bare minimum, and preferably a set of power armor.  If you do that, you shouldn't have a worry about respawning inside the zone.
---
I sold 1 on ps4 recently for 10k
---
Naw, too much work. I like how the blast doors are all open and just running right to the launch card reader. Anyway I used to before the tents. If the dude was launching at the right place no harm done; if anywhere else he is wasting my time anyway and if he was launching to hit DSV9 and the forward camp leaving me standing in a field in front of the honeydew forest well fuck him and my mission is TRULY accomplished. Yes I'm entitled.
---
Ok, thanks for letting me know.üëç
---
AAE and Faster reload (I think)
---
They changed the grill master‚Äôs hat to sell for the second meat week. They could do it again.
---
It would be cool if they added a thing were you and your friends could create one giant camp or basically a town
---
Addictol should only be needed if you drink like 8 beers quick if you can't kill 20 things after drinking 1 beer your an idiot and you shouldn't drink at all
---
I thought the grillmaster hat as an atomic shop item was a mistake and they just fixed it, since none of the other meat week stuff was atomic shop.
---
Because 1st is a subscription, and people will stop oaying for it if they are gonna stop releasing content
---
If Grahm could be his own faction I‚Äôd join.
---
Hi there,
---
Your tests are interesting and provide some useful information but the conclusion about Chameleon having 0 impact on NPC detection is wrong.
---
You compared chameleon armor to unyielfing armor but logically thinking, in order to come to that conclusion you should have compared chameleon armor to wearing no armor at all.
---
If you stay crounched and don't move then having a single (or better multiple) chameleon piece definotely helps you avoid getting detected by NPC.
---
I did some testing on the subject. Equipped 5 chameleon pieces (without shrouded, shadowed, muffled, ultra-light, +AGI or "Harder to detect"), found a solitary high level turret and stealthily approached it until my [ HIDDEN ] brackets started to move. Then, staying crounched and not moving at all, I started unequipping my chameleon armor pieces one by one. No surprise, I gradually moved from [ HIDDEN ] to [ CAUTION ] and then to [ DANGER ].  
---
So whatever you call it ( "stealth" or "visibility" ), having multiple chameleon pieces helps you stay hidden longer and closer to NPCs, at least until you start moving.
---
And no, it wasn't just "turret noticing me over time". I did the test several times, and while being in [ CAUTION ] already, when I started reequipping the chameleon armor pieces I quickly went back into [ HIDDEN ]. 
---
You may try it on your own to make sure, that's easy.
---
Your not utilizing the lucky hole mine or perks well enough to only get 800 lead, after processing all the ores with super duoer 3 and getting all the ores with excavator PA i can get over 1400 per trip
---
Thats the point, you shouldn't even be fighting the sbq outside of the nukezone
---
Oh, didn‚Äôt know that. I still want another skeleton costume though üòÅ
---
One time I killed someone on survival before they fixed how much aid could be dropped and this guy dropped 350 mark 3's
---
I‚Äôd be interested in taking you up on the bloodied meathook if you don‚Äôt want it/haven‚Äôt given it away yet, friend!
---
Honestly, I don't mind the idea of a monthly subscription. What pisses me off is the fact that they explicitly and repeatedly said they wouldn't do one, and then went ahead and did it anyway, before even addressing half of the issues the game has had since launch. 
---
If they had fixed up the game first, or hadn't sworn they'd never have a subscription service, I'd be fine with it. But as things are? Yeah, I "don't like Fallout 1st."
---
Don't know what to to tell you, my dude. Teslas are hard to deal with. There's no real counter. You can do a couple things to help, but that's about it.
---
I did some testing on the subject. Equipped 5 chameleon pieces (without shrouded, shadowed, muffled, light/ultra-light, +AGI or "Harder to detect"), found a solitary high level turret and stealthily approached it until my [ HIDDEN ] brackets started to move. Then, staying crounched and not moving at all, I started unequipping my chameleon armor pieces one by one. No surprise, I gradually moved from [ HIDDEN ] to [ CAUTION ] and then to [ DANGER ].  
---
So whatever you call it ( "stealth" or "visibility" ), having multiple (or even single) chameleon pieces helps you stay hidden longer and closer to NPCs, at least until you start moving.
---
Same his name was not whisp
---
True, same for me
---
I need to collect sverything thats boosts damage and see what i can get out of my quad assaultron head
---
Thats cool.
---
All of it.
---
Giving people options here!
---
Thank you, that was hilarious!
---
? Another? You know you can craft them right? Also all nuclear winter rewards are Atom Shop marked for a reason. I doubt bethesda wants people running around in hellfire armor or a glowing skeleton costume without earning it
---
Especially if the amount of people that were working together increased what types of things you could build, so large groups could for just plop a church down and make their own mothman cult headquarters for example
---
I was thinking of hosting Rebuild days on my private server. Pick an area on the map and invite players willing to place their camp in the area orvrebuild the workshops for a long session.
---
Amazing
---
Thanks you
---
Great writing. Ive been at the nuka cola plant since beta. Ive had around 10 bases there but when wastelanders. Im forcing myself to move
---
Oh ya they have pvp for skilled players its called nuclear winter oh I'm sry your trash and need legacey weapons and steath boys. I'm happy to see survival gone. And merry Xmas to all you no talent hacks.
---
Hey It seems to respawn when hopping.
---
Boosting for ranged is a little different then melee. I know there is specific beers you use, not sure if fury works the same for ranged. I did see a guy showing 3k dmg on his heavy weapon though so it‚Äôs possible. My meathook showed 5k when I hit for 22k. Combine sneak with crit shots and rate of fire you will still do insane dps.
---
I played all day and crashed 1 time. I felt the servers were good
---
damnit i drunkmessaged my ex
---
Oh yeah ive got a few perks up that can increase the damage output a fair bit, just wanna collect the relevent bobbleheads/chems/alcohol ect and have a good test of it some day
---
Same for me, and no, it wasn't a holdover from Nuclear Winter.
---
The truth is this post was never about the state of the game though.
---
Anyone else half-expecting one of the resident trolls to claim to be this asshat stalker?
---
On PC the urban goes for 10k. I think the Forest goes for closer to 15k
---
I love that idea, it could be really cool to just interact and build with one another to let the creative juices flow. It would be a little difficult to work with only because we'd need someone like you who is willing to let other people join, and maybe even a couple other members who can keep the server up and running if you left or crashed out or something along those lines. Because as I understand it private worlds go down unless another person is a member. Regardless, I think it's a great idea.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Little one, it's a simple calculus. This¬†universe¬†is finite, its resources, finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist
---
Meanwhile, I spent a good 1500 Scrip during the last Purveyor sale and didn't get even *one* Bear Arm despite knowing the plan.  Probably the most disappointing thing about that sale, and a testament to how much useless junk exists in the melee weapon pool.
---
I don't know why we can't have broadcast energy, something ala Tesla.  It'd seem to fit in the kind of crazy Fallout universe.
---
All sorts of bottlecaps are going to be used in the future of fallout.
---
I dont know why the fallout 76 dwellers have used them. Intelligent privileged students and than that lol.  Makes no sense in terms of timeline. The Hub made the first step to make bottlecaps to a currency and that hasnt existed in that time.
---
Ceasars Leagion and other factions had their own currencies but nuka cola caps etc where the most superior in the wasteland.
---
Not really a mode that allow you to use your weapons. There's only the battle royale mode.  That neat assassin set you have is pretty useless. In nuclear winter there's no guarantee you can play with the weapons you want.
---
Ill just server hop once I got it all.
---
Lmao small world I used to fight him all the time until the beach boys quit playing on survival because they would lose their aid lol good times
---
*it was le joke*
---
I know this isn‚Äôt the fix as having wiring through walls would be awesome but the way I fix having the issues is either wiring around the very top exterior of my house or the bottom. As most of us know as long as it‚Äôs touching all the walls it should work. Unless it needs a direct connection like turrets or vending.
---
Would be great if there‚Äôs a Leslie character in Wastelanders sending you after Chloe.  They‚Äôve got some opportunities for some fun quests.
---
Well, with the whole classist thing, you have to come into it with the mindset that it's meant to be mocking how people see fo1st. There may be a few people who actually believe it and all, but the majority of people in the group understand that it's just a joke
---
I dont get it why would you ever have to get rid of the camp why would it be gone forever also it looks pretty mediocre to me you could do better anyway
---
Or just make walls, floors and roofs radiate.
---
Anything that requires physical connection stay as that, then you put a connector on any part of the wall/roof/floor to the item and it‚Äôs counted as connected. 
---
So simple.
---
I have blocked, but he keeps coming. And we don't share any friends
---
Thats because acid isnt one of those workshops people care about its more of the fysion core and ammo factory and others......acid hahaha nobody cares that much for acid lol
---
Feel the pain and love. My first affair was a sexy little deathclaw-spawning substation north of Watoga.  That love lasted several months.  
---
Now I'm shacked up in a monorail skeleton southeast of The Whitespring.  Rough start, but we finally agreed to an open relationship...
---
I wonder what camp items they‚Äôll release with this update
---
Because eventually this game will lose support like some games do but very far down the road hopefully, it's not a hybrid of offline/online play unfortunately. Even if you have a physical copy you cant run it without being connected to a server. Maybe one day when it does go out they'll give us that benefit of offline play but i doubt it. 
---
It just kinda got me thinking because today Bethesda halted support for Legends today.
---
Awesome thanks for the info. Did you test the difference between 1 and 5 pieces equipped?
---
If possible can you test if "equipped carry weight" influences detection while moving? A lot of people claim it does. They say a full set of weightless/htd armor and a reduced weight weapon it the best way to go for sneaking.
---
I get that and your probably right and sry for calling it mediocre if it means somthing to you thats all that matters I'm just a build maniac. Happy you still enjoy the game at all
---
I would go play the lottery if I were you........
---
Oh man I just realized with the feature of Legendary Players coming, my camps gone when I restart lmfao
---
What do u mean? Gone?
---
Only if they are doing a monthly bonus, which they haven't clearly stated. We would need to wait a few cycles to tell.
---
Yes but the scrap box has infinite weight
---
10mm pistol that fires confetti
---
Laser rifle with 350 dmg, 800 range and infinite ammo
---
Handmades, Tesla‚Äôs, fixers, plasmas and other  weapons with infinite ammo capacity
---
Bloodied lobber Tesla
---
Trade-able Vox syringer that turns people purple
---
Trade-able Rose‚Äôs syringer that does a special effect
---
Double barrel shotgun that fires 40mm grenade rounds
---
Grenades that turn people purple
---
Lucky rabbits foot that can be thrown
---
Caltrop
---
Poison caltrop
---
Bear trap
---
Bleeding bear trap
---
Legendary Presidential gauss rifle
---
Legendary Gilded minigun
---
Fancy single action revolver 
---
Legendary fancy pump shotgun
---
Blades commie wacker
---
Flaming paddle ball
---
Electric paddle ball
---
Nuclear briefcase that allows for remote nuke 
---
launching
---
QA 10mm pistol and Pump shotgun that do no dmg
---
Commie wackers that give effects like bleed, Rads, poison, disease, etc (dev test weapons)
---
5* 10mm pistol with fire dmg and 20% more dmg
---
4* laser rifle with poison damage and explosive
---
2* VE plasma rifle (they‚Äôre not usually explosive)
---
DE plasma gatling and gatling laser (not usually double nor explosive)
---
All of these are trade-able, I traded for all of them.
---
Edit: also a vorpal 10mm pistol dealing 15k dmg and a BE blackpowder pistol dealing 27k dmg
---
Nobody implied that it did...
---
Chems sell eventually, you have to wait for the right buyer to get more than the vendor bot.
---
My strategy is have cheap prices and some stimpaks available. Once players associate your handle with low cost supplies you get repeat business and steady cap flow. Once you have traffic you will make sales, I aim for what I get from vendor bot and try to cap the bot each day with whatever junk does not sell.
---
Uses a little plastic but it can be done quickly. If I am really pressed for time I just trade in 700 gold or silver from my scrapbox.
---
Based on how quickly it sells cheap supplies is in demand. I also have a random machine which sells ore, bobbles, magazines, which is situatioal but gets rid of odds and ends for me.
---
My ammo vendor has 1 cap prices and regularly sells 556, 45, and fusion cells. Sometimes shotgun shells too.
---
Key junk is acid at 4, lead 3, gunpowder 2, steel at 1. If I get a buyer copper and aluminum at 2. Oddly enough I sell out ore at 1 but it costs acid to convert to scrap so I do not understand why it sells faster than my scrap units, but it does, must be the magic one cap price triggers impulse.
---
You can sell super stims regularly at 25, sometimes at 30. 
---
If you find my shop I will do large bulk deals for fractional prices both buy and sell. I have sold bundles of wood, steel, antiseptic, and so on like this. I bought up peoples glass which is my go to for bulking to the vendor.
---
The plan goes for 500-1k caps normally. I have tons of prime plans so I can check later to see if I have this one. I'm on PC
---
Savage Divide cosmetic rewards give them all at once.  Congrats you just hit the jackpot.
---
Forget playing the lottery as the other poster noted.  You just used up all your luck.
---
I was removing and reequipping the chameleon pieces one by one, and each time the brackets around [   HIDDEN  ] moved. So 1 vs 3 or 5 pieces definitely make a difference at least until you start moving.
---
As to the equipped carry weight I will try to test it later, around New Year. Do you mean only the "equipped gun&amp;armor" weight or the total weight of everything you are carrying?
---
Well thank god then because I would only be chasing the urban one anyway lol
---
Looks unhealthy lol. That colors tho
---
Lol not even once
---
you must be real fun at parties haha
---
If it's gonna work the way I think it is, like other prestiges. We're only gonna be able to keep a few perks and get whatever bonuses we get for prestigeing like +20% more health. Our stash and camps, specials will more than likely be wiped. The only thing I could see us keeping is recipes/plans we've learned. That's my prediction, I can't see how they could let us keep that many items, because of how many things that could go wrong like a complete deletion of character at worst.
---
Rads keep the bodies fresh
---
I understand every 50 levels we prestige a perk of our choosing to make it stronger. They wouldnt force us to restart
---
Go to Dolly Sods cabin, the one in front of you when you load in. Dodge the yau gui ... There is a pioneer bot just inside. He will give a daily quest to collect bug bits, the reward is a pemmican. It's a repeatable daily.
---
Wow that's pretty cool that you've already done it a few times, it's almost like getting a group to play some tabletop games and just having a long session of glorious calamity
---
But you only keep the ranger suit the private worlds are only accessible if you have the subscription
---
Unless it's been updated, you cannot. I tested this ages ago when taming first became prominent. I found a random event spawn eyebot on its own, tried using Max LVL hacker. No tame ability
---
Maybe the rads have dried them up like dead frogs om pavement. Descriptive but you know what I mean.
---
Look at the date on your PipBoy. It‚Äôs just been one day.
---
Is gunslinger a viable build these days?
---
True. But I want to run away and save my ammo
---
Is this groundhog day...
---
u/thismaynothelp Are you on Xbox? If so I could stop by your camp and do the wiring. Got a reputation for being a bit of an electrician for when it comes to doing tricks with the wires.
---
It‚Äôs my birthday today and I settled for a Pappa John‚Äôs brownie to shame eat alone...
---
Only gun and armor weights. I'd really appreciate it.
---
I rage so hard when this happens lol.
---
Not really. I mean it's barely an exploit, you drop power armor to give it to somebody usually. And it required no effort, it's not duping or some other nonsense. 600 was insane
---
It's actually more involved than just dropping the armor, it's a series of steps to exploit
---
Ive thought that maybe a strength shotgun build could get away with it if you can do a bayonete. But who runs one of those haha?
---
Really?
---
Thank you I actually didn‚Äôt know you get them all at once.
---
If memory serves, it's brutal on a minigun with a shredder attachment....
---
Suspension of disbelief is key
---
Instigating and crippling would be decent I think
---
Come find me tomorrow. Nobody called it.
---
I wish they had a recipe for pemmican......maybe with the next Ever Upwards rank
---
Majority of SBQ battles are outside of the nuke zone. You are not familiar with this? Lots if people dont where PA.
---
Happy Birthday Buddy! (Free States Salute)
---
It might be worth it to double-check whether your router requires a firmware update. I experienced a series of disconnections much like the ones you described and they only went away after updating and rebooting my home network.
---
Edit ‚Äî power cycling the Xbox might also be a potential solution. If FO76 has either been running in the background for a few days, or if the console hasn‚Äôt fully shut off in a little while, connectivity can sometimes suffer.
---
Survival was dead and not alot of people played. Atleast NW is a great place for fair pvp.
---
It's not the first time I've heard of this happening. It seems that if it hits one of them on the loot table it pays out all of them. Congrats.
---
It is a consistent bug.  Some intern programmed the loot table, and qc never checked.  Even after a year of reporting....
---
It is viable, fun, stylish, ammo efficient, etc. You can kill 90 percent of the enemies with a single shot. You can use 44 and 10 ammo and sell the rest. You can be a beast. You can look cool. 
---
Problem is, you can do better with a rifle or unarmed bloodied unyielding mutated psycho and onehit scorchbeasts and that. Cool boys don't carry a revolver, apparently. 
---
I love it.
---
You're either lying or have made a trip into the dev room. I suspect the former.
---
&gt; (or terribly near one)
---
I think I covered that.  If you die just outside a nuke zone, you can spawn inside.  Best to be prepared.
---
People certainly do the fight without PA.  I've done it.  And now that you don't usually drop all your junk, it's not a huge risk, but it *is* a risk.
---
Nw is unfortunalty not fair and balance bgs anti cheat soft ware is a joke
---
fun fact: the 'ea' in their squad name is actually pronounced like an 'i' #TheMoreYouKnow
---
i do sorta miss periodically slaughtering them on survival tho :/
---
Well, there's always the possibility of fan servers. Plenty of online games have survived the death of their dedicated servers that way.
---
Yup. I try to get into it on adventure, but it's just finding people then teslas and chem stacking and the worst part is hitting them, then them waiting until your back is turned minutes later to hit back and start the fight. Survival was the perfect in-between, then they kept making it worse (e.g. taking away leaderboards) and slowly killed it trying to appease the people who just wanted Adventure + a tiny bit of bonus XP, and no PVP.
---
I'd be all for an arena mode that's like Nuclear Winter but where you can bring your character and build, maybe that spawns you on a limited part of the map with a timer like NW, or maybe that's just 'always on' like survival was but limited to less of the map, or maybe where everyone's visible. So many things could work.
---
No shame in that, Happy birthday dude!
---
Take a screenshot of the erroneously completed challenges and send it with a short explanation to the Support. They will refund you the lost Atoms. They've already done it for me at least four times already.
---
I‚Äôm not complaining I did an extra long bike session to negate the calories so it wasn‚Äôt too shameful haha
---
I've used a VPN a few times in order to get a game of NW, since my region (AUS/Pacific) is (or at least used to be) completely dead on PC.
---
Switching to a US VPN to play NW never caused any problems for me, and I would hope Bethesda isn't going to focus on punishing innocent VPN users when they still haven't sorted out actual cheaters in NW.
---
As a FO1 user I can say that the servers are much more stable in private worlds. No lag and always decent fps.
---
I completely agree. Some people have legitimate reasons, even if it is privacy. 
---
The bans that we know about are really sometimes minor offenses compared to some of the flagrant stuff that happens unchecked. 
---
I hated the first dupe wave. I was kinda proud of my stuff, and lost that for a while.
---
I hope Bethesda doesn't just go after the "low hanging fruit" 
---
But I still advise caution.
---
Brilliant!!
---
I know it uses a perk pt but dromedary really helps when using demon.
---
The game's date doesn't change. It's still reclaimation day.
---
And also a mounted head plan.
---
This, 100%. This is basically my build, minus the chems, and I one-shot max level ghouls and Super Mutants without any trouble.
---
Yep, I love those moments. I try not to optimize my build and weapons too much because I still like the thrill and possibility of dying in combat.
---
limited bacteria and fungi, across the board throughout the fallout series its been a thing
---
Two shot is cool
---
Or, I‚Äôm telling the truth and you don‚Äôt like it.
---
Did you read that post earlier on askreddit about what makes you hella angry? Top comment was something along the lines of ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre telling the truth and everyone thinks you‚Äôre lying‚Äù this is that rn
---
 If you‚Äôre on PC you can come see it all yourself. I host a museum of cool stuff like that which I have worked REALLY HARD on and have been collecting since beta. Don‚Äôt just downvote because you‚Äôre lazy, check me yourself.
---
Yeah I guess so. I always hear people talking about hackers but Im lvl 45 on NW and haven't seen a single one, Im so confused about this lol
---
Mine works fine.
---
This is exactly where I set up my base!!
---
I used to run with a clanmate who would use Philanthropistin groups, and the range is pretty short.  Think like Flamer distance.  No idea if Cannibal would proc it but I don't see why not?
---
But you've asked this multiple times over the year. You were asking ppl to lvl up 167d ago, and over 300d ago. I don't believe you're only lvl 12, and wonder why you ask this.
---
There is a terminal at the Whitespring with a pre-war entry that says all vendor bots have been programmed to accept bottle caps as currency, due to a promotional partnership with Nuka Cola. 
---
A little shoe-horned, sure, but it does explain why they are in circulation well before the Hub.
---
I made a new character. You didn‚Äôt have to respond to this you could have continued scrolling. What does it matter to you anyway?
---
On pc it is bad apparenlty there are dozens of video on you tube
---
It's not in 76 yet, but FO4 (same engine), I loved using the Neverending (no reload) legendary trait with a single tube missile launcher.
---
I've dropped the chassis on a station to work on it and the pieces are accessible to people standing next to me.
---
I had the spawn glitch happen during Encryptid this one time... Looked through recent players on Xbox before I restarted and was able to get back to the server.  Event ended right before I rejoined and I got my rewards!  Small chance of that ever happening again, though
---
Two shot is cool looking, especially with targeting mod, but totally useless. You get decreased damage on main rocket and bugged 1 hp damage on second one. And it will break after 8-10 shots from 200% durability.
---
If you after explosive weapons, use auto grenade launcher. Two shot works fine on those and damage output is good. Not to mention body parts flying everywhere.
---
(Keeps three TS missile launchers for some reason)
---
Buttyful
---
Haha, I feel your pain. Im on xbox and people say the same kind of stuff to me regarding glitched/rare items. Mostly just jealousy. I too have collected since beta and I have a few weapons off your list. (you guys got it real good over on pc lol) Sweet list of collectibles though man I respect the collection!
---
I make new ones all the time because I love building and finding new locations to use. I do miss a couple of them, but I like rebuilding too much for it to stop me.
---
Thank you! Collecting things are THE REASON I love fallout games, I‚Äôm the stereotypical hoarder.
---
I hope you‚Äôve done great collecting on Xbox and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre every bit as proud of your collection as I am!
---
Anybody happen to get a whole strangler suit this way? lol
---
So you're hi-lvl, and you made a low lvl alt, and you want ppl to power lvl it? Exactly how lazy are you?
---
Absolutely! It‚Äôs a fun endgame for sure!
---
Did you check profile pictures, picture frames?
---
I'm around for a bit
---
So you‚Äôre posting negative comments on a post you didn‚Äôt have to respond to? Exactly how pathetic are you?
---
Did you have to pay membership and have to be online to eat it
---
You'll have to shoot an invite, flashed across the old screen and didn't leave a notification
---
Easy
---
It won‚Äôt let me invite you
---
Just pm your GT
---
Jokes on them, I'm always drunk. hic
---
Yeah hes saying it's annoying that it spawns you in the nuke zone at the "event" which I thoughts a valid complaint. I thought you were disagreeing
---
When u spawn back into the nuke zone, u have a small window to fast travel out. I think it's like 8 seconds ish depending on the Lag Gods
---
Not really I got credit for it tonight and I wasn‚Äôt drunk and or on a team....Thanks BGS, oh also got credit for a few quests I was no where near.....
---
Easy fix: Add a cost of 1 copper to walls and foundations, letting them push power through if connected to a power source. 
---
.
---
Leave it off the wooden shack style, and the metal shed style,  so you can still have a low resource option for newer people, but when it comes to Brick and so on? Add a copper cost, done. 
---
Life will be SO BETTER.
---
(Bonus if you add power sockets at the floor level that you can attach wires to if needed.)
---
Start by picking 1 or the other. 
---
Heavy weapons is a strength build. Rifles are a perception build. 
---
Imho, strength build will give you more overall options if you get bored. 1 handed melee, 2 handed, shotgun, unarmed, and heavy gun. All those without a major respec
---
All the time...
---
Never got one of those in fo4 lol, I should have farmed some legendaries.
---
Right side from the entrance, top floor.
---
???? 90% of fights are outside of the nuke site
---
We will get persistent workshops in private worlds. Obviously it will be for a price but you‚Äôll be able to build wild stuff
---
Some people mentioned that Herd Mentality mutation causes this in conjunction with Strange In Numbers perk card. I got both and this bug is KILLING me!
---
I like how it looks away last second like no i didnt do it.
---
Right now I want to increase my damage, my highest weapon is an AAE harpoon and it does 590 damage but it keeps breaking.
---
I cant complete the quest I have the most but it is saying I dont how can I fix this
---
There‚Äôs some other free item you have not yet claimed.
---
THe green ‚Äùfree‚Äú notice will remain there until you claim all free items in the shop.
---
Currently trying to build a camp like this on Xbox...it's not going very well üòÇüôÉ
---
Make a giant toilet bowl
---
Have one myself. Outrageously fun. Better tan a TSE handmade in durability. I have to kerp throwing away ammo it accumulates so fast.
---
Holy shit you‚Äôre still doing this bullshit lmao. Get a life dude no one reads this shit.
---
Scrip both junkers
---
Use melee at low level and respec past 60
---
Exactly
---
There arent many damage cards for a heavy explosive weapon. Demolition expert is pretty much it. But I would move a few of those perception points to luck and run 'one gun army'. Then since you said you mainly run solo, take more perception and max out lone wanderer. Look at crit perks in luck as well.
---
Some good agility perks but that wont increase dmg. But with that weapon you're gonna want to be more of a bullet sponge tanky build. 
---
If it were me, I'd find a nice rifle and go that route. All perception, agility and luck. 
---
I havent ran an explosive build since they nerfed it so maybe someone else can chime it with ideas there. 
---
Most heavy guns arent about the DMG number but about a combination of dmg and fire rate.
---
I have a couple guns I might be willing to loan out so you can play around with them and see
---
lol I tried a couple of times and died with my feet getting glued to the grond and toppling over, funny I suppose. Then gave up and re logged üò•
---
Thanks, I'm realising this now, so grateful to the replies to my rant. Will have to be faster.
---
Why I carry a Prototype Hazmat Suit, the game gives you 10 seconds or so before it hits you with rats after spawning, enough time to swap.
---
I really love that movie one of the ones I watch over and over, nice balance of humour action and a little romance üòò
---
Always thouth the aliens where a really clever design, imagine some of those in Fallout 76 üëç
---
I realise that, but I died and got dumped right into the rad zone then died fast rinse and repeat.
---
All the fights I've joined recently have been north of the nuke zone on top of the bunker.
---
Dang. I have that mutation too.
---
Jokes on them I'm high.
---
I don‚Äôt have my own but I suppose this is what I‚Äôll have to do until this gets fixed.  Not that it will get fixed though. 
---
So lame. I launched the nuke, more than likely did majority of damage to queen, then got murdered and stuck spawning at vault 76. By the time I got back there were no enemies left to kill. I got next to nothing out of my time and effort besides my 9th t51b jet pack plan. Yay.
---
Will try this next time I run into the little mirelurk babes.
---
Alright I see how it is, it‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt imagine me having the stuff, it‚Äôs that you need to paint me as the bad guy. Thanks, real classy.
---
Back at launch it wasn't too unusual to fail the event after 30min :P
---
Now I can solo her within 2-3min.
---
Honestly think Bethesda should have had a plan to pump out more world bosses or raids with proper rewards and a queue system like WoW.
---
I love this game, but it could be so much more.
---
I've run Fort Defiance like 30 times and I still poop my pants every time those ghouls rush me. Just the sounds of them stirring give me a chill. 
---
I actually don't wear power armour in Fallout games in part because I enjoy the sense of vulnerability. As soon as I go Gundam I lose a lot of the post-apoc vibe.
---
Bethesda needs to copy No Mans Sky and add an option to auto power everything at your base without wires and it also would help the game since wires wouldn't need to be rendered thus more budget.
---
The legendary Bashing effect should add 100-500 points of damage (based on the level of the weapon), to make it worth having on a gun.
---
Otherwise, why wouldn‚Äôt I just swap to my melee weapon of choice?  Even my sniper carries a vampire axe for molerat bonking.
---
I can never manage to get a hit off the Wendigo at the end of One Violent Night before it's swarmed. Bethesda says they might be able to figure out how to write the lines of code required to give all the participants loot from the legendary by the end of 2020... here's hoping!
---
You can rejoin by selecting someone in your recent players list, assuming you see some.
---
You got Jack AND Shit?
---
Damn, I must have done after Jack had left town.
---
We wouldn't be part of this reddit community if we didnt think it was worth it.
---
No it really isn‚Äôt, I hopped back in a while ago after leaving for a month or so, just the same with less people
---
I think you're being a bit defensive about it. Most of the items you listed CANNOT be legitimately obtained. Of course you can trade for them if they exist, but the people you bought from didnt get those weapons by normal means. You obviously know this already otherwise you wouldn't have made a museum for them!
---
I would love to see then but I'm on xbox so I can't.  Since you are on PC, it's super super easy for you to print screen and upload to imgur then put the link here to show us
---
Nothing till next week dont worry heal up . !
---
Your a good person
---
Gonna have to disagree
---
Wasnt it like 3k atoms or something ridiculous? Merry fuckin christmas here's 4 skins for the price of 2 full dlcs
---
What do you mean by "worth it"? The game's enjoyable enough, most of the game breaking bugs have been fixed, dupping's down, and we're about to get the NPC update. So, Bethesda's rather scummy business practices aside (*cough* Fallout 1st *cough*) the game's in pretty good shape.
---
I go around just giving away high level loot to people I have barley met. Such as a two shot handmade with limb damage I gave out earlier today.
---
Someone once gave me a low level exploding bullet pistol I decided hey it‚Äôs Christmas so why not
---
Thank you!
---
+karma
---
I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth to grind it out with what‚Äôs happened to the game and also I haven‚Äôt stayed up to date so I feel like I would be really lost
---
I'm familiar with the way people who know how to position the drop do it.  Seems to me that it's done right maybe half the time (at least lately, I was in at least 3 today that dropped dead center on prime, annoyingly).
---
If it worked they way it's supposed to, OP wouldn't have a problem.  But something in the code for event groups doesn't give you a spawn option a lot of the time, so it's best to be prepared in case it 'does a Bethesda'.  Since it frequently doesn't, my suggestion makes perfect sense.
---
Don't worry, there will be plenty of time for adventuring whist you recuperate üëçüèª
---
That's called learning ;-)  Now you know.
---
As a lower level player, or one who doesn't have good gear to get you through, the SBQ fight is a risk.  Worth it, but you can die horribly and often.  Even in power armor, you can get killed if you're unlucky, but at least in that case you respawn protected.
---
You *might* have time to pop on a hazmat suit before you die to rads, though I wouldn't count on it (if it's possible to put it on a hot key, it might help your chances, but I haven't checked that).
---
I carry 1 set of PA just for queen fights.  If you can't afford to carry one around (10 lbs in the frame), you can pop back to camp to grab it, if you want to reduce the risks.  You should be able to pick up a set with a little farming, or get the excavator set by completing the quests.  I'd still suggest carrying a small stock of radaway in any event, the PA doesn't totally protect you (though it helps a lot).
---
Well the AAE harpoon can actually benefit from Heavy Gunner perks. Get all 9 and you‚Äôll have a 60% buff, which is quite significant. Rifle is good but just a little bit boring. Pretty much everyone and their uncles are a stealth commando aimbot build nowadays.
---
Heavy gunner is for non explosive weapons tho
---
And I agree rifle is boring. I like my Mr. Stabby
---
Okay bethesda bot when youre on xbox servers and you run into the same bases when going around servers or find the same goo piles in the same places after hopping thats forsure less of a pop, game pop ight be the same but i assume 1st solo servers or just general negativity has had a impact on the games population
---
Says an Enclave purist! Lol!
---
I agree with toy though extremist religious fanatics are no bueno
---
It did!!
---
Ok, so I'm not missimg anything. Lol. I was pretty sure it was bugged but I figured I'd ask to be sure. Thanks!!
---
Well this sounds fun! I'm in
---
Yeah was limited time quite awhile ago in the shop.  Was out even before the mothman bundles.
---
Supposedly, you have to be the last one to put a bullet in it but you did it solo sooo, there went that theory
---
You missed a 24 hour bundle return to the atom shop during the week of Halloween as well.
---
I don't need to show any evidence; you're the one claiming it. Just please stop spreading these hoaxes, if you don't have first-hand experience, pic or video.
---
It will be nice alternative to kill enemies in a creepy location rather than just a gory/raider one.
---
Glad to hear it, anything you find in your adventures will be welcome.
---
I gave a two shit mini nuke to a lvl 10 yesterday. Present üòÅ
---
I‚Äôve got 3 characters sitting on junk 2/3 weapons and armor that have no decent value more then maybe 200c, I‚Äôve only had the one bear arm so far and that was my lucky role, I‚Äôve got a furious and anti armor ones aswell
---
I don't see what's the big deal have you ever played fallout 4?   I believe they explain what the power connector things are for its very easy really,  I have a nice house on fallout 76 and have my connector go through the roof to my pillion stick thing going to my turrets
---
I bet they had a lot of fun with thatüòÇ
---
I'm a very nice person.  Anyone needs help. I'm there.
---
I, in turn, am annoyed by that bug that makes my controls unresponsive when respawning after death, forcing me to change the server or wait until I'm killed again, hopefully to restore my ability to move :(
---
New to the game here, if i move my CAMP do i get to keep the floors, walls etc i already made, or do i have to build it from the start again?
---
They go into a storage where you'll be able to build them in the same way or different way then before. You can create blueprints of a certain build that you can instantly place with what you have stored.
---
Oh thats great, thanks for the help!
---
Same and same
---
Saphyrice
---
I think you have to modify an existing backpack but I‚Äôm not sure. I haven‚Äôt purchased any backpacks
---
Though I can‚Äôt remember if the Scout variant is a separate item or a paint job, so I could be wrong
---
What is the BOS White powder?
---
Spotted it when you uploaded it. It's on my watch later list for when I get a few moments to sit and enjoy it. Very much looking forward to it though.
---
The skins are for already crafted backpacks. You will need to complete the tadpole quest in order to obtain that. The backpack you can craft currently is the small backpack which is something they made available a while back and easier to get then the tadpole.
---
Also Christmas Trees and Lights, A snowman and a reindeer with a red nose (actually two red noses and not really a reindeer)
---
Actually I like it. On my laser gating. Just for fun. Between reloading: boom.
---
Useless. But funny. üòÅ
---
Doesn't work on PS4, there is no option to join recent players.
---
Have a few grenades on you to throw into groups - that will ensure you have tagged a few and get xp when the higher level players take them out.
---
Likewise, if you see a legendary, just hit it with 1 bullet and you are good and can loot it once it's taken down.
---
While that‚Äôs the idea behind blueprints, I wouldn‚Äôt trust that you‚Äôll be able to place the camp later. The blueprint system is buggy and unreliable.
---
There's definately a legendary effect that does that, but none of my weapons have it. Also I don't have any perks that do that either. You not had this problem then?
---
Yeah forbthe neon ketters that are only vlue for some reason even thoughbtheres multiple colours of them in fo4
---
Once you've activated a quest and removed it from your active quests it remains iff the list till you make it active again.
---
I'm not sure what your issue is?
---
Sounds very cool, does anyone have a pic of this?
---
Thanks :) ....um I think your auto-correct just had a seizure by the way :D
---
No, i was level 43. Doesn't stop events, location based quests and yeah just new quests. By the time I finished one objective in the main quest I was working on, I had to untrack 5 quests. It's just annoying
---
I do like the morgantown map better, because I enjoy the heights of the cityscape, but I'm very happy to see some variation.
---
I can't complete the quest because it is bugged so I tried to shoot her this morning. She is immune to murder attempts &amp; I am displeased with this.
---
Oh my, yeah technically i dont have the auto correct on so it tyoes exactly what my mungo thumbs type and im a little too dense to check before i post
---
Ill be voting for Morgantown every time but welcome variety. Looking forward to when more maps are released.
---
Oh golly, you're in for a treat. Go explore Lucky Hole Mine, and if you see any tunnel/wall that looks like it's covered in moss make sure you check for secret tunnels. You'll know when you find what you're looking for.
---
I have those two in Prefs.ini  
---
fShadowDistance=0.0000
---
fDirShadowDistance=0.0000
---
I don't mind the game looking like crap, playable fps is more important to me.
---
Momento mori et carpe diem
---
I am, I started nw after they took that off so itll be nice to play!!
---
The reason, I'm guessing, you get next to nothing for playing 7600 hours is people have died playing online games. Just guessing.
---
Even though I use it, I agree but there would be a massive shitfit among 80% of the player base. Things are finally starting to settle down for Bethesda (brought back the NW Halloween challenges, weekly free atomic shop items and the upcoming free santatron) I don‚Äôt think they want to risk another backlash.
---
I noticed that in the RV where the conspiracy theorist is, there is a ton of chalk art about aliens. Also in the Asylum and the lucky hole mine. I've wondered if maybe understanding some of those ambient details has a hidden message.
---
There are about 5 or 6 events that have a 0.002% chance to reward it. I've forgotten which ones, because that chance is just ludicrous.  
---
While u/valseek said that he would pump it up the chain, no change has been made to the drop chance for several months now.
---
Just hope these some you don't have to pay for.  Santa Fallout boy I'm thinking...
---
I use it too, I just wish I didn't have too. And I know what you mean about everyone getting pissed off. But even if it just doubled the jump height it would be better, what we have Now is like 5 times the height!
---
I know how the creature looks :)  
---
But is it in fact a Wendigo Colossus?
---
I already have a quite efficient trap on my Camp that it's also cheap to repair.
---
It uses a combination of fall damage, spike boards, 2 Rad Emitters, 1 Tesla and 3 Flamethrowers.
---
Most of the damage comes from the fall damage, and I manually activate the other traps only if I need them (PA and good builds).
---
But this trap uses to much of my Camp's budget, and I would like to know if it's pointless having 3 Rad Emitters on the same spot...
---
Good to know, I'll run some tests.
---
I love marsupial and it would suck to part with it, but it would absolutely make the game more challenging and possibly more fun. I'd miss jumping around like an idiot, but it's true that ghouls are basically useless as enemies since I just jump on a ledge and snipe them with no repercussions.
---
If Bethesda ever drops the ball we will 100% see private servers running 76 and fixing the game; or at least see it dragged into Fallout 4 and used there.
---
Do you remember to lock them?
---
They only can hold 2 at a time you have to keep collecting the big ones only hold like 5 at a time
---
No, there is far to many to lock, however I'm sitting in my camp for 30 mins and nobody steals anything, yet I make like 3 water
---
How do people fall?
---
They should just monetize it for that true pay to win aesthetic.
---
Yes, but they don't reach 2, I'll be sitting for so long and they don't make a thing
---
Yes, and it was that moment i realized i have a nukashine problem.
---
There might also be one at Big B's Rest Stop near Harpers Ferry.
---
Yes because weaving in important when the whole damn world is fucked from a nuclear blast. It's a "survival" not a farming sim
---
Yes, please. Have my up!
---
And they are all hooked up to generators all wires going correct places?
---
 Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
Yep, all powered and I have them separately wired each to the generator
---
Get paint cans too
---
Welp boys thanks for -5 karma it was just me ranting after 5 hours of full team afkers
---
:D
---
Thanksgiving dinner table was a real bummer not being able to decor tbh
---
By the preview it had that food dehydrator shown on top but it's still a normal table. Guess it was planned but cut.
---
Who just ruined it for me so thanks i dont think i will be returning to this sub reddit the amount of hate this got was unreal
---
If i couldnt jump on a building id still cheese enemies by hiding in a building where that dclaw cant fit and plink it do death
---
Just show a dweller making out with an assaultron and I'll be happy.
---
How many generators you have and how many purifiers
---
It's not reality.
---
See that's the sort of thing I like, it would make running to that peice of cover more tense.
---
I disagree. If you run a bloodied vats build and you use all your Ap for vats, then you can‚Äôt run away really if you need to reset or regroup. It would essentially nerf bloodied builds in my opinion üòÅ
---
A watched pot never boils
---
About 50 purifiers and 4 fusion generators. I make enough power
---
kill 76 scorched with a gunpowder weapon challenge "*exist*"
---
*look at his shitty legendary gunpowder rifle with bashing effect
---
me an intellectual: well i guess i'm gonna bash the shit out of those scorched in Morgantown ¬Ø\\_( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_/¬Ø
---
If you nuke with the edge facing that forest kinda thing with pink trees? when you die you have enough time to walk out of it
---
Was 2000 for elf and santa bundles igrinded like hell for that santa outfit still find it hilarious they said that was the discount price
---
i'm like 300hs but yesterday i found a watchtower west vault76 wtf?
---
why u need that much water xd? craft them with dogwood bleach and waterpurifiers you can also proc superduper ;)
---
if your running turrets or lights it could take power away from your purifiers other than that id very carefully check all wiring again one generator only holds 12 purifiers. Technically 12.5
---
*raises hand*
---
.... What? Enforcer perk is pretty damn cool!
---
I run a character with a shotgun build, so make good use of it.
---
Have you tried connecting smaller groups of purifiers to the individual generators? Don't cross connect the generators, the math for power requirements should be the same but it will be easier to troubleshoot.
---
It‚Äôs so useful and I hate saying I agree. Maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be removed but there should be times it works and times it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
-It could work like Healing Factor so when not in combat you get to jump higher than when in combat.
---
-Reduce the height of the jump in general so it‚Äôs not obnoxiously high, but still helpful to get on cars, small cliffs, etc.. just not on a roof top or some fences from the ground.
---
-Maybe make the negative effect the same always and not reduced by class freak or strange in numbers, just like how speed demon always has the negative effects
---
Just a few ideas of changes without just removing the mutation completely
---
That's a rare drop, make sure you don't scrap it!
---
I've got a bladeless knife and headless sledgehammer from those weird no upgrade options that got patched out a few months back.
---
How is that even possible?
---
Thanks for taking the time to give all this advice, I'll save your post for reference üëç
---
Lets see some of your camps.
---
The closest thing in 76 is "quad", never ending was removed probably for balancing reasons.
---
It just sucks because it breaks instantly.
---
Events drop purified water frequently and both of my characters always carry a few bottles of booze just in case 
---
They also both have alcohol addictions but that's beside the point.
---
And sheepsquatch club and Sheppard's crook.
---
That depends very strongly on geography and definition of "purified"
---
I think i saw a utube video on the water purifiers and why they dont produce like they should, look on utube it might still be there
---
I occasionally have a similar situation with my lead extractor, where it says I have 0 lead scrap.  However when I press the ‚ÄúR‚Äù key to transfer, it shows the full 14 lead scrap.
---
Try the ‚ÄúR‚Äù key or bound keyboard transfer button?
---
Pretty sure cheaters ruined it for everyone
---
Or spec into both and get a pipe revolver/bolt action. Cool boys carry pipes!
---
Imagine bashing the SBQ 1 hour ...
---
Even if the negative effect is not reduced, it is easy to live with -4 intelligence, that is basically just 12% less XP, but for someone who is already high level, that does not matter much, let alone if they also gain 15 intelligence from unyielding armor anyway. It needs to be something more severe that really offsets the major advantages, like take 30% more damage, or similar.
---
I had this as well. All mine were locked and u had heaps of power too.  I had it so they wernt all connected to each other. I gave it a week and noticed some wernt giving me water so I scraped the idea. Couldn't find a solution. But good luck.
---
This is why I wish wish survival mode was an actual survival mode, not a pvp deathmatch. Tougher, enemies, scarce ammo and meds, need to sleep and no mutations.
---
I've checked it all, and I have an extra 20 power to spare
---
The only way to get them is from events in the Savage Divide (like Messenger, Uranium Fever, Violent Night, Guided Meditation etc.) with a 0.01% drop chance, or other player's vendors. They do NOT drop from Enclave events, although that would make sense.
---
I'm doing it on a large scale for caps, it's apposed to make me 730 water an hour, however it's broked
---
Even real marsupials don't jump that high.
---
Just laying her head down for a quick cat nap before another reign or terror
---
I use shotguns too. 
---
What that dude is saying is that the bayonet is useless- which it is. If you are that close you may as well pull the trigger- it is the range you are supposed to use shotguns after all.
---
I've... I've said that.
---
Yes, I'm with you.
---
You can change the color of the urban mask to Forest
---
They also spawn on the train tracks  not far from there for me
---
Karma whore lol
---
Kudos on the 2 secs Imposter kill üòÅ
---
How about a switch on the play screen, ‚Äúlast server‚Äù or ‚Äúany server but‚Äù?
---
Only sucks for nw and pvp take it away for that but not adventuring its so much fun.
---
I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, the game runs pretty smoothly for me. I am over 600 in at this point. It certainly is not ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. If you said that a year ago you might have a point, but the game is much more stable now. If you are having such terrible lag that you can‚Äôt see what is killing you, the problem is most likely on your end at this point.
---
Also inside the hut where that imposter sheepsquatch Encryptid event happens in the Ash Heap.
---
INT should affect fusion core consumption in PA, AP consumption in PA or PA durability. This way, you have to choose if you want to use PA and jetpack, with high INT and better bonuses/stats or if you want to go non-PA with low INT and marsupial. Some SPEACIAL doesn't have real downside when low..
---
&gt; tattered field jacket 
---
Ummm... No?
---
Ummm...What?
---
I'm not at all sure what the field jacket has to do with the scout mask
---
Yeah I got like 3 hunting rifles in total
---
the name "sniper rifle" shows up when you put a scope on a hunting rifle.
---
1st day she opened got an IE per lever action. Nothing else that awesome since üòÇ
---
I only like bashing to help stagger enemies when they get close range. Never been excited about that perk though lol
---
Sorry, translation error probably, English is not my first language. My point is that I get only railway rifles, harpoon guns and plasma pistols. I've never tried to add a scope to one of those but I'm guessing I can't mod them into a .308, right?
---
I quoted the wrong comment ;p
---
I meant that you cannot change the color of the Scout Mask.
---
Thanks! I'll keep on trying then
---
Be carreful it's like alcohol withdrawal. You will probably make a delirium tremens during night seeing a pink Chally the moo-moo climbing your room walls üòÆ
---
Worst as that's usual in the game to see flying or sliding characters for no reasons you won't be able to make the difference between reality and dreams.
---
Be carreful man.
---
I've heard different. And that after you change it you can wear the newly forest mask with hats
---
You can for sure change the other armor (chest, arms, legs)  But only from Urban to Forest.
---
I don't know... jet packs must be changed significantly too.
---
First of all, I'm playing since the start of this game and I didn't bother to gather out of game info and I never found anything about jet packs inside the game - I really don't event know how they work besides seems rare players using it. They need to be a little more common or, at least, have ingame knowledge spread.
---
Second fly and climb are different - jet pack should use much of ones load limit, and make them able to jump really high, while climb could be free of extra load, but would be limited and "conter-able".
---
And you have to scroll through everything.  Maybe twice.
---
Make them actually look bigger while you are at it. Mind boggling how unnaturally small both spears and pitchforks look in this game
---
I started day 1 of the break it early way back when and for my first 2-3 weeks I really didn't meet or talk to many people then I ran into a idiot dieing of thirst next to a radiation zone since he didn't realize using chems drained water levels and ever since me and him have been on stupid adventures together and now have over 100 people running around with us 
---
moral of the story once you get 1 or 2 friends suddenly it snow balls as your not just friends with them you meet the people they run into and boom massive community suddenly
---
I haven‚Äôt played this game in a while, but your post has piqued my interest in it again. Gonna look up unyielding armor because this is the last quest I have to do for the main storyline I think and I‚Äôve been dreading it.
---
1000 in 24 hours. P good.
---
They are mostely in found in the Military trucks with the back opened i know Where some are, Outside of the powerplant next to flatwoods
---
I‚Äôm glad u have no problems with your game.
---
I dont know if the game files from any of the updates are misplaced or corrupted, but I reinstall the game twice and it still blue screens.
---
I have a 1 year old ps4 pro and a gaming pc that exceeds fo76 requirements, all with 600Mb symmetric internet connection, run every other game with no problem.
---
Blue screens (Error C-34878-0) specially at whitesprings and purveyor 
---
Infinite loading screens
---
Server disconnections in the middle of SBQ event
---
Respawning in the radiated zone when U got killed out of it.
---
Having to click 3-7 times to get to fast travel.
---
Some event items not able to interact with (meesenger repair module laying on the ground)
---
The respawn/loading screen times.
---
The godmode enemies just standing around not interacting.
---
Sliding laying down ghouls.
---
Most of my friends across 3 continents have had similar problems.
---
I‚Äôm over 2200 hrs invested in this game between pc and ps4, I‚Äôm happy u dont have any problems (whatever) but you dont need to undermind my questions to bethesda.
---
You must live in a bubble, just do a google search before u knock someone elses concerns.
---
I somehow suspect the balance overhaul coming with Wastelanders will be unpopular with the "old" player base in any case. These kinds of changes are best left for when there is major new content, and an influx of new players.
---
I actually have a anti armor bash damage 90% weight reduction hand made I use with a large blade and the basher perk can kill most things lvl 40 or lower in a hit or 2 depending on hp so saves me a good bit of ammo and since I don't need a bullet or 2 on the 30k mole rats I run into every week......
---
Maybe there is a "mad dog Malone of the week" event for prisoners... and that would make it a title, nor a name.
---
.. each time is a different super mutant (they are a out all the same anyway).
---
The Radaway debuff counted as drunk.
---
Groundhog day
---
you ARE trapped.
---
Bashing could be really useful on a sniper rifle when a small enemy ambushes you, even on Shotguns I find it useful for how little I play it
---
Interesting. I will try verifying it today. The Scout, Wood and Robot armor are definitely going to have such a functionality when new color schemes are released for FO1st
---
I recall some in Fort Defiance, and also at Grafton dam, not sure though if they are the usable variant, or ruptured.
---
Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.
---
Pretty sure if you hold the light button again it gets brighter on excavator FYI
---
Share your GT and I'll hook you and your boys up with essentials.
---
No. I wear a mining helmet with the bright mod when I'm in lucky hole getting lead and get the bonus.
---
 THANK YOU
---
Well. It seems that the game makes the ambient light brighter when im around it..
---
Also are you in 1st person? I‚Äôm sure this is an obvious question but you can see better in 1st person.
---
The camp beside West Tec has one or two.
---
Well yes. Lol. I couldn't in third. I mean ive almost got down where all the spots are in lucky hole, but Id like to be able to see.
---
BGS Austin does have [25 jobs](https://jobs.zenimax.com/jobs?department=&amp;located=&amp;location=12) available right now, I do not think it would make much sense to expand the studio if there were plans to abandon Fallout 76 in the near future. It was always stated that FO76 is a long term project, and that is understandable once we consider the next Fallout is likely a very long way off, I would guess at least a decade away. Until then, a live service type game that can evolve over time with new content could work well enough once the content is made more palatable to people who would prefer a single player experience with living NPCs, and the technical issues are fixed to a reasonable extent.
---
Grafton dam has 2 ruptured next to the cop car but also 2 good ones on the brotherhood catwalk along the front fence.  I usually pick them up for the acid.
---
How is this relevant?
---
Why do fanboys have to come in every ‚Äúconstructive criticism ‚Äù thread and try to discredit and knock down the topic??
---
Go enjoy your flawless game and system and leave the rest of us to let bethesda know that there are still things to get fixed
---
you are the one claiming i am incorrect, along with many people in the search bar.
---
again search bar has evidence of others first hand experience.  you have no evidence that counteracts it at all.
---
Camp McClintock has a couple in the back offices on the first floor.
---
I hope you enjoy it, thanks for watching
---
Are you on pc?
---
Just craft another one than. 
---
You can make 100 of them if you want.
---
Mad Dog Malone in: Prison Break Part 2
---
And have it so the list doesn't go all the way back to the top after you list something. That one really frustrates me.
---
Around what times do you usually play? I'm usually available from about 10pm to 1am EST.
---
To be honest, I think that‚Äôs too many purifiers. 
---
Depending on what you can craft, you can probably get your daily 1400 caps faster &amp; easier another way. 
---
For example, if you have the Marine Tactical Helmet plan, those are easy to craft and you can get a lot of caps that way. Mothman Egg Omelets are also another quick source of income. 
---
And as long as you can get your effective Charisma up to 20, you‚Äôll max our your selling prices. 
---
I only craft Purified Water for drinking and crafting. Rarely do I sell any.
---
Yeah, how could I forget that one too... that one is very irritating. Good catch
---
There‚Äôs a vendor in the enclave that sells them I believe. It‚Äôs been awhile since I played
---
What do you even do anymore? I ran out of things to do after 100h
---
Not on PS4
---
Cheaters are members of the "master race"
---
That's litterally the plot to the Mothman movie (as in the "based on a true story" fiction film)
---
I have five characters with unique playstyles that keeps the game kinda fresh. They all beat the story, have their backpacks and cameras, etc. I spent a good amount of time collecting things - the rare baseball bat variations, the ‚Äúglitched items‚Äù, full sets of specific armor perks. But really, mostly, the hours have been consumed with the building facet of the game. I‚Äôve built just about anywhere and everywhere!
---
You live in Chicago and arnt more worried about catching a stray bullet than a fictional monster?
---
I‚Äôll most likely be on around that time
---
I wouldn't complain,  but I would want a bunch more mod options for weapons to compensate.
---
I think those are newer since I‚Äôve found 3 in the last month.
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious how you manage so much playtime. I didn‚Äôt realize it was such a touchy subject...
---
No, love the movement options. It makes just traversing the map enjoyable. Personally I find running around as a low level insanely tedious, so speed deamon and marsupial make a huge difference
---
Lots of fallout "fans" hate the game. Shit posts, brigades, and people who just sub to downvote.   
---
Unless you say something negative that's the way gamers are these days I guess.
---
But yes, join events as much as you can. May die (be sure to stash your junk) but only need to hit legendarys to get the loot. Same with any mob. Lots of plans, rare outfits, and xp to be had.
---
I use to bring lots of stims and pick up people at Queen fights. Made some friends and got some good loots too.
---
Probably playing more and less reddit
---
You can't turn it off now. It would be like showing a car to people and then tell them to keep using horses.
---
Thank you Ill definately try it. You can never have TOO MUCH lead. It goes so quick. Im going to mine till i get 1000 then Ill take a break from it for a bit.
---
Btw go and question the guy that just posted that he has over 2300 hrs
---
Eh, you get used to it.
---
i wouldnt want to scroll through all that crap.. there would be too much stuff
---
also if there was no space restriction people would use it for storage by pricing stuff that isnt worth it at max caps..
---
The would need to be a search feature for sure.
---
PM me your gt. I'll try to get a game going with you later!
---
Just kill Sentry Bots
---
I agree.
---
Anything Goes still has meaning to this day. It's definitely one of the best
---
White Knight. It's in Agility.
---
I‚Äôm not talking to him. I‚Äôm talking to you. How do you manage 6 hours/ day for over a year?
---
That's how I roll. üòÇ Really didn't expect it to go down so quickly. Let me know if you wanna farm any events or do vault raids.
---
I already told u, more gaming and less bothering people on reddit.
---
I like Anything Goes because it is social commentary... Even with WWII looming, he wrote about hollywood scandal, four letter words in media, etc that further cemented the idea "times are a changing."
---
I enjoy the message too. I wish music was produced with more meaning and observation of culture instead of pushing agenda. It sounds better AND it doesnt make you wanna slam your head in a door jam repeatedly.
---
&gt; have found the incredibly high jumping of the marsupial mutation to be annoying, Immersion breaking in the fact that pretty much EVERYONE can now jump 20ft into the air, or just straight up ridiculous, So personly i honestly think this specific mutation should be removed/replaced or at the very least heavily nerfed on the jump height. 
---
Hey now, dems fightin' words pardner. I mean, you aren't totally wrong, but leaping between rooftops like a proper superhero dressed as the Mistress of Mystery is one of the few true pleasures of Fallout 76. It would only be better if there were more rooftops.
---
Exactly.
---
The game needs a serious rebalancing. 90% of the legendaries are garbage or situational. I think some effects could just be removed and new ones added
---
Murgle spawns in every new server. I have a camp there as well!
---
You don‚Äôt want a hunting rifle anyway, the lever action is better in almost every way.
---
Of course it makes a huge difference, but it's too much of an advantage. Speed demon has the downside of consum8ng hunger at an increase rare, so I don't use it. Marsupial however, has basicly no downsides whatsoever having a low INT in this game means nothing. So that's why everyone uses it. There needs to be either a more dramatic negative, or reduce the height.
---
One person said that jumping with marsupial should use up a lot more AP, which I think would be a good idea.
---
Sometimes creatures like rabbits and cats die when you walk next to them.
---
So you killed Murgle. Monster.
---
I think you may be right, but if could be balanced better.
---
I can log on reddit while on the toilet at work. I can‚Äôt play fallout while I do that. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to call you out for lying to discredit you- but you sure do deflect a lot.
---
I mean have you seen the condition the prison is in?
---
I love when she flys underground.
---
This is wildly inaccurate. Can you imagine the outrage if presitiging made everyone wipe everything? Bonkers.
---
I have no idea why you think it wpuod effe t your plans and CAMP, but rest assured, you'll be fine and your CAMP will still be there. 
---
If you are really worried , blueprint it all.
---
I wish they made a market place in the server that is a location for everyone to have a vendor. Each spot has a small allocated space you can decorate much like a bazaar. I think it would be cool. Or maybe at lease have items there be 1/2 weight
---
Its not
---
Just pop it out of your vending machine and re list it at the price you want, I'm confused on your issue.
---
Because I dont have to give u explanations.
---
U just dont know when to take a hint.
---
This conversation is totally worthless.
---
Will do what times tend to be best for you?
---
Murgle is immortal! Long live Murgle! One of his animations has him all splayed out, but he only looks dead. Built a full cat camp there. It is great hearing Murgs as I do my crafting and take my car naps.
---
Nope, mate. It doesn't work like that. How could I possibly produce a proof of it *not happening?* You're the original claimaint, you're the one who should support your claims with proof, otherwise it's just a lie, plain and simple. I'd be happy to watch some videos, though -  I mean that's basically what Bethesda requires to enforce a ban of a griefer, can't get any clearer than that. But you don't have them, right? Only some reddit telltales and downvote button, greatest weapon of man without arguments.
---
For the last time: You can't grief anyone unwilling with strangler, unless in pvp - which is consensual, even in workshops, save for some extreme borderline cases. If you happen to fall victim to Strangler PA during shootout - it's on you. Shouldn't have claimed that workshop, shouldn't have picked the locks, shouldn't have tried for that sweet 5 caps bounty. 
---
I have this particular feeling that people complaining about getting beaten with this weapon or that armor actually tried to pvp, but fell short.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just to be clear:
---
 **It causes server instability** \- partially true fact (it doesn't affect server, but your own cpu)
---
**griefers use it to harass other players -** hoax 
---
**trading it is an exploit and should be banned on every trade platform -** opinion
---
Now I spent too much of my own time arguing with an uknown guy, who is wrong on internet, and I already regret that. Have a good day and please base your arguments on facts, not guesswork; it will help the whole community.
---
This right here. There is a limit to how much water (not sure if all resources in general) a single camp can produce, if I remember correctly its an x units per hour scenario.  You can set up tons of purifiers but once you hit the limit they will not continue to produce until the limit resets.  Not sure who did the video either, sorry.
---
Lol. You sure are getting defensive. Seems like a silly thing to lie about. I was impressed at first.
---
Hard to believe but, I actually never seen that one before.
---
Big Rock Candy Mountain is about pedo hobos
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
You r one annoying redditor holy shit lmao.
---
I dont really care if you believe me or not.
---
I‚Äôm in the middle of a silo, go play some more hrs and leave me alone.
---
And go get that toilet time problem checked out
---
I wasn't expecting an amazing Bloodied Bear Arm or anything, but I was expecting *a* Bear Arm... even if were a useless Stalker one! üòÇ
---
I'm saying instead of canceling the item and re-listing it (what you're suggesting and what I'm saying I'd prefer not to in my post). Having a quick option to just override the price. Make sense?
---
Advantage in what though? If its pve balance its not an issue as you can choose to use it or not.
---
If its pvp I kinda get it to an extent but the issue is more with the way tesla rifles work as opposed to marsupial. Also, vats helps to fight against people moving in irregular ways.
---
Nuclear winter I think they should never have introduced the card in the first place.
---
Other option would be to give people using private worlds the ability to set preferences, like disabling mutations, legendary effect ect.
---
I legit hate this
---
When she does her crop dusting attack she flys through the ground and then reappears somewhere else. So we cant hurt her till she's back
---
Sounds like a huge headache
---
Oh it it
---
Congrats!! Amazing üòâ 
---
Be careful though there are annoying redditors like u/itscmillertime who will not stop harassing you until you tell them the secret to reaching a milestone like that.
---
 I think we're all murder hobos in post war Appalachia
---
I'd be nice for all the queen bugs to be fixed
---
I play most evenings after 7 but can sometimes play in the afternoon depending on work.
---
Yeah and finding a server that actually helps. Did queen yesterday, we had enough people but half were just watching
---
Good news is he can free up a ton of camp budget now but I hope he wasn't hurting for the crafting materials it took to make all that stuff!!
---
PVE advantage. All of the mutations are supposed to be a trade off, but marsupial is all good with nothing to worry about. 
---
My main problem with it is it looks stupid, doesn't suit the game and it makes ghouls and other melee creatures look like a joke. I think if it used up 50 AP points per high jump and we were able to control our jump height by holding the jump button down, it would be better.
---
Oh that definitely is annoying. That happens all the time to me except not with the queen. People in my group would just follow me everywhere I go and stand next to me watching me kill enemies all day not even doing anything. Also, it's very frustrating when it is queen time you'll see a bunch of people trying to kill it with just pistols and shotguns.
---
https://casanders.net/music-history/the-true-story-of-the-big-rock-candy-mountain/
---
Murgle is immortal.  He will respawn after a bit.
---
I didn‚Äôt use marsupial til lvl 80 and it‚Äôs made things much more enjoyable. I would be really bummed if it was gone
---
I dont even run purifiers at my camp i drink inert flux weights less and is better than water
---
I agree with you. At this point it‚Äôs too late, as so many people rely on it (myself included), but it never should‚Äôve been implemented.
---
Thanks. I knew it was kinda like that. Just like Candy Island in the Misadventures of FlapJack. Low-key same thing cuz pirates are just water hobos.
---
I guess so, it doesnt seem necessary but we all play differently :)
---
1. This is sort of what they pitched to us in the beginning. 
---
2. Imagine the grief. You think we could rebuild the world together but there‚Äôd be just as much cooperation to tear it down simply for the hell of it. Which could also be fun. But different.
---
As a Fallout 1 player? What does that have to do with this game?
---
The - doesnt mean its negative. Just means you have something thats reducing that stat in some way
---
Which platform are you on? Is it the hunting rifle you want?
---
I never beat her. People suck
---
I usually beat her but a bug always ruins it where it was useless doing it anyway since I cant get her loot
---
I think all the mutations should have worked like bobble heads where they only last 1 hour, only one mutation at a time, but you could stack as may as you like. So you could use 3 and it last 3 hours. That way there would be a point in having the recipe aswell.
---
Would mean people only use them sparingly, for endgame events etc.
---
Such a waste of ammo. I used 6000 5mm and didnt beat her.  Pisses me off
---
Perhaps there should be a limit on how long the item can be up for sale, if no one buys it for too long, then it is automatically removed from the vendor and returned to the seller's inventory. Another idea is to require the payment of the vendor tax in advance by the seller to put their item on display, then they get the sale price if/when it actually sells. Alternatively, there could be a limit on the number of items, when that is exceeded, an algorithm should decide which one is to be delisted based on factors like age (time since being added), price relative to what it would cost at a vendor bot, and rarity.
---
Cool will do üëç
---
Think that's just a personal taste thing then, the game isn't a survival game. It's always been zany and does goofy stuff, least in my eyes. The apocalypse is an interesting backdrop but realistically it doesn't really factor in to how we navigate the world.
---
Ive never had my immersion broken by seeing a dude jump really high but guess it depends what you want from the game.
---
Melee combatants could be given a secondary mode of attack, like the sheepsquatchs spines, or ap draining attacks, ones that decrease strength and encumbrance. I'd much rather see that than just flat nerfing something that arguably doesn't need to be touched.
---
That's why I never use most of my ammo. I made that mistake the very first time I was beating her. The way i kill her is i wait for her to land then headshot her all day with my gatling or plasma gun and her health goes down pretty quick. If she flies back up I don't shoot but maybe one shot here and there with my 50.cal sniper
---
Might be that someone saw the bag, took the flux but left the junk, happens to me from time to time in blast zones.  Butt wipes in the waste land!
---
I was only shooting her on the ground, but i was also mob controlling since hardly anyone helped
---
Yup and because they didnt take it all, no notification that another player has taken your loot
---
Explosive effect doesn‚Äôt count. Try it and you‚Äôll know.
---
the enclave vendor sells them but only 3 or 4 at a time &amp; for like $400 caps, theres a van near whitesprings that spawns one in the back of the van near the gazebo, but half the time its been looted. Ive been going on private servers &amp; claiming the power plants to farm them but it takes a while and you usually disconnect and end up wasting your time
---
lmao yeah, I'd say if anyone doesn't help or are strong enough then don't try beating her. Just switch sessions and do another silo . That's what I do,but of course look at the map first and see if theres a good amount of high levels in your map
---
I am on PS4 and I completely disagree with your statement.  They run smooth as silk for me.
---
The luck perk Scrounger you get a chance to find them in ammo containers. I get a lot of them now since maxing the perk out.
---
I've never seen this phenomenon before.
---
You could be in stealth versus non-stealth.  Likewise, hitting the Queen's head does a lot more damage than any other part, and for both lag and animation reasons, her head's hitbox doesn't consistently match where the visual is.
---
You could have the effects of Radicool, Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction, Unyielding, or Bloodied in play too.
---
I wasnt the one that nuked. Idk who did, lol
---
I tested it and had my friend guard my bag, its a thing, trust me, and its bullshit...
---
You hit the nail on the head. Today‚Äôs music has been weaponized to dumb down society. Compare the songs from half century ago to the popular garbage today it‚Äôs not hard to realize how dumb the population has become.
---
Not sure which ones spec you are talking about, below are the three you might mean.
---
Bomber jacket-leather coat.  Forbidden knowledge quest reward. Do search on this, can turn in mult times a day for reward.
---
Hunter longcoat-traveller coat. Responder bot vendor.
---
Longshoreman coat. Grahm. Take a workshop like lakeside cabins a return there every once in a bit to see if he spawned.
---
Also for grahm\vendor bot one of two can hold him in buying menu while another logs off and back on to get mult attempts at dif inv items.
---
This I agree with.  Stares at stupid stalkers weapons.
---
 None of those items disappear. You won‚Äôt be able to go into a private server or use the scrap box
---
Yep. There's nothing to be dome either. Too much sensitivity. I wish people could deal with opinions better. They can say theirs all they want, but if yours crosses theirs... You better bring ear plugs.
---
That one in particular came to mind.
---
If you dont end up having luck on reddit I'd google "lfg fallout 76" and got to any of those sites too
---
For me the Beta release ran smoother than the game does now, private server or not!
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you man :) or female
---
I am also on the PS4 pro which might make a difference.
---
when your subscription ends you can no longer add scrap into Scrapbox and you can no longer place your Survival Tent. You will continue to be able to take out and use scrap from Scrapbox. You no longer have access to start your own private server.
---
You DO keep any FO1 skins you claimed from the store. The box stays but you cannot add to it. Other FO1 players can still use your box. The tent disappears and you can‚Äôt use it or see friends‚Äô Survival Tents on the map.
---
 
---
If you get this then cancel and want to stretch out your scrap in Scrapbox then you want to put the scrap on your person before crafting so it uses the scrap on you BEFORE it starts getting pulled from Scrapbox.
---
This.
---
Would go with the slocun joes nuclear winter power armor paint that is a sprinkled donught.
---
I stand corrected. 
---
Dont think I've ever used an explosive heavy gun before, too slow for my liking. The card is misleading "your non-explosive heavy guns do 'X' damage". 
---
I took one out of my vendor and verified. Learned something today, thanks.
---
No
---
I am melee so no question of stealth. PA so no armor effects. My weapon isn't Bloodied. I don't have any of those perks as well. I observed this on several Scorched Earth fights. Head shots show up in yellow, this was a body shot.
---
Put a bayonet on it lol.
---
Yep, it happens, either get to a stash quick-smart or you can also drop then pick up your flux, that means if you die it will be in the bag.
---
you actually lose the flux upon death. no one gets it.
---
The first thing to go away is your dignity.
---
Tried to find what the camp limit was for water production but not sure still. I did find threads where people are saying that all purifiers of one size ( all large, small, industrial) share storage space as if they were one purifier as well. Since there is a weight limit for how much a purifier can hold, once that weight value is reached no more will be stored in any of that size in your camp.  Apparently the best bet is to build a few of each size so that the weight limits are spread across multiple sources, allowing you to at least come back to more water if you are away for a while.  But they will all stop producing regardless once the hourly limit is hit.
---
It's annoying but I think Bethesda was trying to stop people from logging in and hitting 1400 caps for the day in 20 seconds by selling unlimited water.  According to other threads though these limits aren't in place of you take a workshop and build purifiers there.   You could always do that if you really want to make a crapload of water....and pvp all day long lol
---
that‚Äôs a slick tip to drop and pick up, ty
---
You can see your friends' tents even if you don't have 1st, btw. You can fast travel to them to.
---
Revolvers suffer from low damage, so explosice would be a better choice.
---
A couple of easy ones in Darling Sister's Lab up in the northwest.  Two on the helipad on top of Watoga Civic Center, but can be tougher to get to depending on where you are in the story.
---
Alright. I need something to do with all my .44, no one buys it either.
---
The fate of most ammo is to get thrown away.
---
You should do your own nukes lol
---
I never actually bash with my weapon, but I do notice that the bash damage increase mods usually increase the maximum condition of the weapon
---
That is what life is about. So, enjoy it while you can and it is meaningful.
---
Btw, nice camp
---
The travelling leather coat or the leather coat can be a reward for several events, not just heart of the swamp. I got mine from an Always Vigilant event. Others include play time or irrational fear and a few others that occur in the Mire.
---
That said, always vigilant may drop it regardless of location - I did the one that occurs just near Morgantown and that's when I got my coat.
---
It's a rare drop however, so just keep trying. And keep a lookout in player vendors or even robot vendors in the world. It's often amazing what players sell for really cheap or by accident. You never know - I've come across some amazing bargains this way!
---
I just threw away a bunch today, and I still need to lose more. Honestly, I'm swimming in them. Use Power User 3 and they last for ages. You'll never need more than 10: and by the time you hit 5-6 just do Line in the Sand or go looting and you'll have a bunch again.
---
Whenever i do  not enough people show up lol, and we check the server before we do it. I have never killed her if i launch nuke lol
---
Huh didn‚Äôt realise you can even do that!?!
---
Does he activate the daily when you go to the nukashine?
---
&gt; how could i possibly produce a proof of it not happening? 
---
so you have no proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that my statement and the other users first hand experience is false. according to YOUR OWN LINK ONCE AGAIN, you need to show the burden of proof as testimony is evidence.
---
&gt;downvote button, greatest weapon of man without arguments
---
if only i was the one downvoting you... 
---
&gt;You can't grief anyone unwilling with strangler
---
for the last time you can, follow them and crash their games. prove it false beyond reasonable doubt.
---
&gt;trading it is an exploit and should be banned on every trade platform - opinion
---
not my quote, but also fact, the armor was (and is) ment to be untradeable, like every single other vault reward
---
&gt;griefers use it to harass other players - hoax 
---
still yet to dispel any evidence beyond a reasonable doubt
---
&gt;Now I spent too much of my own time arguing with an uknown guy, who is wrong on internet, and I already regret that. Have a good day and please base your arguments on facts, not guesswork; it will help the whole community.
---
and here i spent to much time arguing with someone so wrong and oh so dense, they cant see thier own hypocrisy despite linking to it themselves.  please learn from your own mistakes and next time try to prove evidence wrong __beyond a reasonable doubt__
---
I know. Lol they need to add ammo scrapping for lead and gun powder. Real life Id be breaking down all the stuff I dont need. Id prolly only keep a good bolt rifle like a .243 and a shotgun. Anything can be used for shotgun shells if youre brave enough.
---
Wait, you can alter the intensity of neon in the game? ü§î
---
They always intended to make ammo scrapping a paid feature. That's why it's not there.
---
That's weird, I did before. But I also do silos just for the exp

He didnt die. He just fainted due to having company again. He was just so happy to not be alone. He will recover to full health again the next time you log in.
---
Exactly so. 
---
Would also like if we could set it to go on and off, or cycle the letters on and off...
---
Oh, and could we get some simple geometric shapes as well?
---
Needed to top off that exp buff
---
I like Morgan town better but options are nice. Playing the forest sometimes should be fine.
---
Thank you for your kind words!
---
Nah, I've lost flux when I've been all alone, or my bag was guarded by trusted friends.
---
Still learning, so thanks for the input üòÅ
---
Indeed. I've been known to bulldoze my way to a stash/scrap box to deposit the Flux before something happens to me...
---
PS4!
---
I'm on PS4 and quite honestly after this I don't know what I want any more. Maybe I'll switch to a railway rifle build lol
---
Anything with a very fast fire rate, my junkies 50 cal shreds
---
I know you're hurt and I hope you can get back out to Appalachia soon. So im sorry but when you said "mist" instead of "missed", I laughed my ass off. Again I'm so sorry, I know you're in pain but god damn, that hit me perfectly in the funny bone and I lost it. I'm sorry and thank you. We'll all see you soon OP.
---
They just need balanced, not removed. I too would be bummed if marsupial was gone. Without being able to climb, vault, or crawl, the only way to navigate the map is Mars. Have you played without it after having it for months? I got so annoyed not being able to jump over a damn log or anything over 6" high. Effects just need to be balanced to be on par with bloodied at end game level. Nerfing bloodied would make the game not fun to me. My berserkers weps should do the same damage as bloodied when I have super low damage resist and so on.
---
I am on PC
---
U got laid up at the right time as long as ur out this week. The festivities don‚Äôt start till the 12th pretty much. üëç
---
You are apparently luck then there are dozens of video on you tube now with people cheating and watching people cheat
---
I won‚Äôt even give that bitch the pleasure of accepting her quest.
---
Bitch.
---
Lol
---
Find yourself an Instigating Lever Action.  Even just a 1*.  It will transform how you play.
---
Yeah, i run melee most of the time, so i guess i need to find a .50 calüò¨
---
I used a non-legendary gatling laser on a scorchbeast last night, and for some reason that thing shredded, despite not even connecting half of the hits. So i guess heavy guns are the way to go.
---
Lucky man. Happy birthday man
---
I dont wear power armor and shouldn't need to put some on so I can climb a fence to get away from zombies.  
---
While we are talking realism lets get into what kind of jetpack it would actually take to lift said armor you are endorsing...lets also change this crazy notion of carrying around multiple power armors, miniguns and .50 HB's.  Trust me when I tell you, as a former Tanker, YOU (and I) are not carrying around a .50 HB, let only 2 for any extended duration.
---
Melee is pretty pointless unless your using a gutsy buzzsaw or a ripper.
---
The more hits your getting, the more the acid damage racks up.
---
Miniguns, LMGs, 50 Cals, etc
---
Heavy guns are pretty damn good, they might be heavy and take a lot of ammo, but they certainly put out a lot of shots and damage
---
Yeah, i tried a ripper, and even that didnt seem to work very well.
---
I wonder... ive got a bloodied 10mm, do you think that could be viable?
---
i can imagine shotguns would work great too
---
maybe you could even make a chainsaw viable 
---
would be funny to see someone actually using that thing
---
It does fire pretty fast, best advice is to craft a bunch of guns that have fast fire rates  and run around trying them out.
---
The acid damage does work better on tanky enemies, as you can put more shots into them, before you kill them
---
the acid damage itself is low, so fast firing weapons and multishot weapons will stack faster than slow weapons. bonus stacks for explosive effect as well.
---
for example my QE pump will throw up 10 stacks per shot if i hit all the pellets, a flechette harpoon hits about 6.  a tse minigun in its cpu frying glory will put up iirc 22 stacks/second.
---
What the first person said. And the pip boy wont show a negative or zero value for stats in that tab. For example, my junkies commando only has 2 STR for Bandolier and a couple addictions that give -1 STR so it should read as 0 but doesn't.
---
Oh, i used the chainsaw and it melted.
---
I just dont have the carry weight to hold onto a 20 pound melee weaponüòñ
---
And for whatever reason, i tried using the other V-fast weapons, and they didnt work that well. So i guess no ripperüò•
---
Ill try shotguns for sure. Thanks!
---
1- Standard repair at 100% and th other 150%
---
2- for me I prefer the Hunter 
---
3 - I don‚Äôt know 
---
4- if their team have mutations they can go with a perk card that buff ur mutations (Charisma) and they Can run  more fast with a perk card that is on charisma that does to u can run 20% more fast
---
well why dont you just store some other weapons and make the chainsaw your main weapon in that case?
---
also doesnt it benefit from the martial artist perk and therefore gets much lighter?
---
Yeah, the little set bonus icon says 50 poison damage, so either thats lying or 50 poison damage is nothing.
---
Ill definitely try some of my smg's and heavy guns, i guess we'll see how it goes.
---
It's true we all play differently, but it also doesnt seem necessary to have to take it out, just to re-list it either. Especially if you're price adjusting several slots in one go. A bit more time consuming, but hey, to each their own. :shrugs:
---
Are you kidding? You take a pair of pliers or even bend it  and pull the lead off. I dont have to pay anyone to do that.
---
It gets down to 12 pounds, so thats something. But the problem with the chainsaw is that if you even get slightly staggered you have to hold down the attack button again. That makes fighting any melee enemy a complete pain, so im trying to find weapons that arent V-fast
---
Alrighty. Thanks for the advice.
---
its 50 damage over 10 seconds (5/s)  then enemys will also have a resist stat to it as well. enemy dependant it can be strong or weak.
---
it will ruin people in pvp though if that is your cup of tea
---
Yeah well ammo scrappers will be in the Atomic shop. It was confirmed months ago when they announced repair kits.
---
Should do a PSA for the lot that doesn't figures that
---
I'm probably moving my camp after wastelanders anyways
---
I found him the other day too after shopping at a nearby CAMP; I took a bunch of pictures and cooed over him. I stopped by the town nearby just to grab the travel marker, but when I walked back over to Murgle's shack to say bye, he was dead. :(
---
Maybe when I move on from my current CAMP, I'll move in with Murgs to his little coffee house...
---
Ah. I wish it said that. Thats a lot weaker than i thought it would be.
---
And i dont really do PvP too much, but its comforting to know that i can melt.
---
Not at all exploring is the best part. When I do FT I jump to train stations to sell everything, and then walk to everywhere else.
---
Most of the times it‚Äôs not sensitivity it‚Äôs more like stupidity. When knowledge and skills are absent they can only use attitude and the volume of their mouth to appear important. Then there are paid influencers on pretty much all online forums to defend ‚Äòofficial‚Äô narratives and corporate reputations. Most are dumber than a door knob and stand out like a stink bug on a bald head. They are in fact detrimental to their employers but apparently the companies thought they are somehow useful.
---
Sweet, that‚Äôs a great advice!
---
Thx üëç
---
I agree.  I believe there is an exp date for all sales on the WOW auction house. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve played though.
---
You can make a white one pink with the assistance of someones head.
---
I see them in a few camps, the problem is they use both stash weight and camp build space.  I like finding 90rw trash weapons for displays.   No one knows what the weapon is so the legendary does not matter.
---
Long live the immortal Murgle for she/he is immortal (quite literally)
---
are you on pc? i kind of want to adventure with you. RickSanchez70
---
Bash dmg calc off weapon weight i think
---
1. It is an interesting map with quirky stuff hidden throughout, so that is a great way to experience it.
---
2. Get help horder.
---
to get the mining bonus you just need the arms, to get the carry weight bonus you need all parts
---
I doubt I'll even have to wait that long. I've been camped at Wilson's garage for ages and fully expect to lose it to an unbuildable zone when wastelanders releases.
---
Or maybe just let me type in the price instead of that janky slider.
---
get you well if you want to stick with melee your best bet would probably be a knife or dagger with faster swing speed
---
I just want a Watoga map
---
This too. Thanks for your input man. The slider nausea just amplifies with lag. Lol
---
Username checks out.
---
Indeed
---
Alright, ill be sure to try one of those. Thank you.
---
Me too. I only display reduced weight, larger weapons (don‚Äôt need it on swords and knives). The weapons are just there for eye candy in my camp.
---
Murgle is great.  Deep, real DEEP sleeper.
---
I wish there was cat/dog interactive animations in this game.  Would help the game not feel so ...... empty.
---
Such is life in the great here-after atomic apocalypse.
---
Another card called squad maneuvers also adds speed if in a team.
---
If you hold a pistol while running there is also another card in agility that adds speed.
---
each person purchased the game, and is allowed to play as he wants.  if that means you have to move on to someone else, do so.  you seem like a no doesn't mean no kinda person.  just sayin
---
used a bashing-damage Fatman the first time i did the Atomic Possum Badge.
---
Closest I ever came to saying "Yes, bashing damage increase. Sweet!!!"
---
says something about a person doesn't it
---
I just noticed this thank you.
---
Doing uramium fever
---
Its a fucking video game lol, you take this shit too seriously
---
Ya, I think something at Whitesprings with room for 1 vending machine for everyone on the server would be awesome.
---
Upvoting for honesty. =D
---
Lvl 37 requested it, you were too thick to put a price on it. Maybe if you sold to more players you could afford a better gun?
---
I wish the had robot vendors you could get that would hold the same amount as 4 vending machines.
---
I dont care to have a better gun. It does what I need it too. Im not pvping
---
I actually ignore anyone who tries to pvp
---
Have you seen what condition the prison is in? I am surprised he doesn't escape more often.
---
Food build life.
---
Same here. Probably haven't been able to fast travel since mid 30's.  Now 180. Analyzed my weight distribution and Aid, Ammunition and Apparel were top three.  I carry about 100 canned dog food(Good Doggie Perk) and about 65-70 of each Nuka.  My Stash is always full and cannot put everything I'd like in Vending machines.  But, it is a great way to see W. Virginia.  Since I'm trying to do a lot of Queen fights lately I am hanging out in the Watoga Station and if I see someone in a missile silo head out to the Flooded Train Yard and wait for the nuke.
---
No, i just want wastelanders
---
Ye and I usually play solo. I get distracted when on mic and I have a child so I gotta drop the game in a heart beat at anytime.
---
So you're ok just being mediocre?
---
Pretty sure all legit PvP players have moved on from fallout. Nuking survival mode and making 0 attempts to combat cheaters in nuclear winter has caused everyone I know to finally leave the game.
---
Yep.
---
Fallout first subscription
---
3 events you should always do:
---
The Path to Enlightenment: Communing with the Wise Mothman boosts XP for an hour
---
Feed the People: Rewards 5 Canned Beef Stew, which boost XP and stack with the above
---
Leader of the Pack: Spawns 3 Legendary Alpha Wolves and each can drop a starred weapon/armor
---
I think the lever action is the best sniper rifle, actually. I‚Äôm on PC, unfortunately. Could have hooked you up :)
---
It also affects the amount of scrap you get back. Not much though, if you get 10 plastic out of a laser rifle, with marsupial you get 9. I went about 300 levels without it.
---
Thanks! I sent you a chat request from the mobile app. 
---
My gamer tag is LLWhiskeyLL and looks like llWhiskeyll in game.
---
Lol  The PS4 community is bustlin‚Äô. It ain‚Äôt dead at all. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be removing it anytime soon.
---
Are you overrepairing it? You can double its durability with a perk(can't remember the name). It has three levels and can be switched out when you're not using it.
---
If it‚Äôs the gulper food one you have to have the meats in your inventory when turning in
---
I repair some of my explosive guns 3 times a day, think you are doing well. I found the luck perk that repairs your weapon to be more useful than gunsmith.
---
If you're on PC the [Save Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148) mod does this, among other things.
---
"Weapon artisan" i think it's called, under Intelligence.
---
I stayed up late last night playing and found a suit of power armor.  I can‚Äôt equip the armor until level 60 but figured out how to equip and use the frame.  The fusion cell is nearly out of power though and is at 22%.
---
Are these not at rare as I thought they were?
---
I got on for 4 hours yesterday, and my ps4 blue screened on me 7 times until I gave up
---
Thanks!  My tag is LLwhiskeyLL and looks like llWhiskeylll in game.  A white icon with deer antlers.
---
Torso not arms. The description is wrong.
---
That would be good. It's not like anyone has the carry weight to just roam around with a bunch of stuff to sell on average, unless they're playing a traveling merchant. When you trigger that emote, and the other player accepts it, you're both transported to your camp.
---
It's a conspiracy
---
Oh yeah. No other enemys and when she reappears all the enemys spawn lol
---
It‚Äôs Torso for the mining bonus not Arms.
---
*Grahm liked that*
---
that happened to a friend of mine unfortunately you probably have to wait and try tomorrow he was forced to be without playing it for 24 hours before I would let him load it cuz it kept kicking them the best day it worked fine and hasn't did it again since.
---
I feel like this was disproven, I haven't noticed it working for me anyhow
---
Very cool
---
I asked a simple question and you started flipping out. Relax. You‚Äôre being childish.
---
It would if they fixed the perf mod. Someone posted the mod doesn't matter, so did a test.
---
Perf mod on qe handmade [https://imgur.com/fBkYHvL](https://imgur.com/fBkYHvL)
---
Drum mod same gun [https://imgur.com/ydypZtK](https://imgur.com/ydypZtK)
---
edit: sorry was a qe handmade
---
Darling Sisters lab should have several laying about.
---
Yikes. I don‚Äôt k ow what you are doing to get constant freezes. If I was experiencing that with a game I would probably move on and play something else.
---
Stopped at a camp that had 18 Tesla's on display, no discriptions. I have about 20 up right now. My favorite by far is the minigun with the tri-barrel mod and the BOS paintüòç
---
I think the last that you put with grim reapers Sprint one is the best choice
---
I don‚Äôt know I will need to test later. Just sharing what others have told me. I never run that armor.
---
Yeah ive had this happen to me often as a bloodied build
---
That‚Äôs how the initial beta was for me. They had those limited time day where you could only play for like 3/4 hours and they happened to fall on days I had to work. It just means you‚Äôre a mostly-functioning adult.
---
Priorities man.
---
fo76 &gt; real life obligations
---
Happy Birthday, my friend, I hope your day was blessed. 
---
Not to steal your day, but it was my Birthday aswell. 
---
 I  glad you have such an amazing family to make you such beautiful Fallout 76 cake. This made my day! 
---
I wish you, and your family the very best!
---
Take care man
---
Standard Kits repair your weapon/armor to full condition, while Improved does it to 150%.  The Improved Kits drop as part of Scorched Earth, Encryptid, and behind-the-scenes when you kill Scorchbeasts in general.  The perk cards Weapon Artisan and Fix it Good can improve things to 200% condition.
---
There really no reason to buy either from the Atomic Shop, if that's what you're asking.
---
The thing is, once you are able to hold your own in those events, repairing basically becomes a non-issue because you'll be swimming in repair kits, and because they actually have weight and are non-transferable, you end up using them.
---
PC I guess ?
---
I've been tempted to get this game on PC, but I'd also need to get a PC. Unfortunately I'm on console. I love the idea of mods.
---
Tell that to my wife üòÇ
---
#DAMN SON
---
It does work for me, at least occasionally
---
The best way I've found to get steel is farming west tek. If you run scrapper and Unyielding you get 20 steel or so per assault rifle
---
Hopefully u dont have high level ass holes come and take ur stock
---
Yes, PC.
---
Yep. Thats what Im doing right now. Also for legendaries.
---
Poison is the whole reason why Mirelurk Kings are nasty in PvE.  It's not surprising that it would be useful in PvP, because not many players can defend against that type of damage, seeing as it's limited to that one armor perk (+25 poison resistance).
---
I guess there are few of us celebrating our Birthdays to day. 
---
Happy Birthday, my friend. I hope you had an awesome day! 
---
I wish you the best.
---
We'll be handing out the guns and ammo directly to each player, no vending machines.  Other dealers will be there also to help hand out the guns and ammo.
---
It's amusing to see people poke, punch, and shoot me to get me to hit back. I never take the bait but very amusing lol
---
Can you scrap, bulk and sell? I would go crazy not being able to run or fast travel
---
Good thinking. Good to hear the good side of the game
---
That's weird. I've had that happen maybe a couple times but not every time.
---
It's one of those events that takes like 2 minutes to do too lol.
---
It must be hard work fighting off all those new black Friday vault dwellers invading her territory
---
Happy Birthday my friend, I hope you had an amazing day. 
---
As I said in a previous comment there must be a few of us celebrating our Birthdays yesterday! Kind of ironic. 
---
I wish you all the best!
---
The Pipe Revolver is specifically good because you can equip it with a suppressor and benefit from the dual perks of Gunslinger and Rifleman.
---
The other revolvers are kind of sucky because they can't do either.  You'll be hard-pressed to maintain stealth with a .44.
---
I actually end up using a non-explosive Bloodied Pipe Revolver FFR over my explosive pistols, not just because it's ridiculously powerful, but because the lack of explosive makes it less likely to trigger that obnoxious damage rubberbanding effect.
---
That sounds like a good idea. I didn't know the suppressor would do that!
---
Oh yeah had a no reload shotgun. Pretty fun.
---
Happy Birthday my friend, I  hope your day was blessed. 
---
I guess there are a bunch of us celebrating our Birthdays on the same day! 
---
I think this calls for a celebrations within the wasteland together. 
---
I wish you the very best!
---
They changed this a while back to discourage killing people after a queen fight. It's intended behavior.
---
Back at you! :)
---
Yeah, in this game, suppressor = silence.  As long as you have Sneak and sufficient Agility, enemies won't see you using it, and you can reap the 2.0x damage benefit (2.5x with Covert Operative, 3x+ with Mister Sandman).
---
I mean make it into a rifle! Lol
---
Happy Birthday, my friend, I hope you had an amazing day. 
---
This is getting more, and more interesting, as I keep reading the comments there is at least 10 of us that celebrated  our Birthdays yesterday. 
---
Animal hides turn into leather. Mole rat, Brahmin etc. You have to scrap it at a workbench. Itll say scrap all junk.
---
Pretty much this.  It's after the SBQ is killed and showing that in the post apocalypse, humans are the most dangerous creatures.  Much like the Walking Dead, I suppose.
---
Go down stairs and to talk to biv and the quest will start
---
Yeah, kind of like the Tyranids
---
Went shopping last night and a found a  furious mini gun and furious plasma cannon.  I have upgraded the plasma cannon with the prime receiver but I don't have the plan for the mini gun yet.  Now I just need to get into a SQB fight to see how it does.
---
Raw leather is the same as leather. Any animal hide when scrapped is leather.
---
I didn't know the flux was just lost when you die.  Good to know now.  Thanks
---
What stinks is when I take my mule shopping and people put vending machines places you can only get to with marsupial. When you see a lv 7 who can‚Äôt reach he could still be a rich bastard shopping for someone else.
---
(real trap shit)
---
Now this is all personal opinion, but as a shotgun build myself, I would max out the bloody mess and then pick one of the other two, but not both.
---
Ah, you are trolling. Nevermind.
---
LOL.  It makes absolutely no sense, but I always drop some meat for that cat on the odd occasion that I find myself near Welch.
---
I saw a truly excellent camp at that location.  They built upon the existing structure of the coffee shop, just as an in game NPC would.  Vending machines were appropriately stocked with canned coffee, which was another nice touch.
---
Likewise to you too, Chum.
---
I end up working overnight shifts and running 17 hour days maybe 4 times a year, and magically they almost always coincide with 2xp weekends. Thanks Obama.
---
Sort of like the level of all the bot vendors it would be cool if we could do that
---
I was you at one point, back many months ago. 
---
I think it all apart of the game. You get into this grinding mode, scavenging every thing, to see what you find. 
---
Trust me after 2000 + hours, it will become second nature, and  you will know exactly where every thing is that you need for materials. Cap stashes, bobble heads, magazines, and the list goes on. 
---
It becomes less desirable, and you become more efficient. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
Long NV on actual sniper and lever action rifles, a must for far away headshots. Short NV or reflex sight on multi use rifles like combat rifle / fixers ... they're not really night vision are they? üòÇ should be a bit more illuminated or highlight enemies more...
---
Didn't start playing until after they changed the map so I've never been can't wait 4 the change whoop whoop !!!
---
Depends the mods on the gun can easily reduce the amount of durribility. If you run the suppressor it breaks down pretty fast.
---
Haha I know the feeling. When the game first came out I was doing the same thing. Luckily I'll be free for this
---
That's why I like the tales from the west Virginia hills the narrator at the beginning makes it feel like an authentic 50's radio show
---
I think everyone who owns the game does
---
17 hour shifts? üò≥ what are you man an ER doctor??
---
I use Bloody Mess 3, every shot has 15% more damage, Critical Savvy 3, only need to fill up 45% of the bar before you can do another crit shot, and Better Critical 3, 40% more damage from those, now more often, crit shots. Along with Class Freak 3, Starched Genes 2 and 1 extra point do with as you please, may be Serendipity.
---
I sent you invite, I am yisus
---
That is Awesome, I am not far behind you. 
---
I am at 2223 hours, and I keep suffering from radiated strokes. 
---
I hope to eventually make it to the 7600 mark, for that 80 atoms, and another stroke. 
---
Never saw the flyer, was sent there on the PA quest from the High gorge bridge maintenance room
---
Must be a FO1st thing, you can clearly see that guy has the subscription.
---
That's a great way to do it. I used to put very basic plans in my vending machines for 0 caps, but occasionally a high level player would take all of them, including duplicates. I started pricing at 1 cap and that was enough to keep them from taking them.
---
Just to expand on this. While camps do have a limit workshops do not.
---
.. and if you don't like that they got two words for you!
---
This is why I don't open up trade windows with random people.  My God rolled weapons I carry around are mine I have no interests in parting with them.
---
Then shadows are not what your issue is.
---
I just do it in case he needs something since hes a lower level. He just wanted my gun. And people make me out to be the selfish one! Lol
---
Actually it does. The longer you stay in a world time eventually passes into the next day
---
Nope retail! Go retail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I was hearing jingling Bells every now and then even before they came out with the inside the vault that States that will be coming in the future Christmas event.
---
It‚Äôs the rifle stock not the suppressor. Normal revolvers don‚Äôt have that option but pipe revolver and pipe 308 have it.
---
This should be all the time through the holidays till New Year‚Äôs Eve. That‚Äôs what I call a happy Christmas.
---
Ohh I see.
---
It scraps into raw leather which I have 4 of now, but I still can't craft because the leather is greyed out.
---
Not yet :(
---
But it doesn't want to craft using the raw leather :(
---
Stand in water or by a barrel of radioactive waste for the rads. You can also buy a radiation emitter plan from Graham or the meandering vendor bot ( I forget which). As to the repair/crafting question, the INT effects should work from unyielding armor, but I don‚Äôt know from my own experience.
---
Hopefully get the old one's back for a short period too, I missed them and have always thought they looked awesome. I'd definitely pick all those signs up.
---
Not crazy to me.   I‚Äôve been been overencumbered for well over 100 levels, so I cant FT.
---
 But I‚Äôve cetrainer found a lot of stuff/places/things I would have missed if I FT all the time
---
It gets tedious (or frustrating) at times, like when you are near pioneer camp, adn someone sets off a nuke at WS.... Ansd you need flux....
---
or Working on the pioneers badges like backpacker...
---
OTOH - The Journey Is The Reward
---
It's not too much damage. It's too much damage over a short time that isn't a one shot
---
We just had one a week ago so who knows
---
There‚Äôs a popular camp spot on a cliff side with some pre-existing structure to it that‚Äôs swarmed with cats
---
She just had one, and there wasn't one mentioned as part of the upcoming Christmas festivities. I don't expect it. How much scrip do you keep?
---
Oh right, that‚Äôs interesting :)
---
Maybe because there were fewer players made her a less formidable foe. Did you know the types of weapons the other players had?
---
NPCs will Be instanced. No offline mode.
---
Why
---
One really have to marvel at the "logic" behind this.
---
I will be doing this on X Box as well. Level 5 Brotherhood recon rifles for everyone.
---
I probly heard it 3 or 4 times. Each time was only for a second but I was wondering what the hell was I hearing. Then a couple days later they came out with that inside the vault explaining that will be in the future.
---
 Haven't heard it since.
---
Great thinking on direct to player. I set up an aid station: free radaway, stims, food and water and would have a level 200 come through and take everything, fill back up, same thing would happen. Tried to do something nice, just left defeated.
---
This. Disconnects are par for the course.
---
It's all online. Even now you can have a conversation with Rosie as part of her quests and a teammate won't hear it.
---
It‚Äôs also not from FO76
---
still crashes:(
---
I assume when you talk to an NPC if there's another player around they'll just be invisible while you talk like in other games.
---
Yep, happened Friday night.  Twenty minute(real time) hike back to WS since I needed Yellowcake Flux.  As it turned out the Blast Zone was oddly placed, did not cover the Golf Club or the row of cottages the south side of WS so, almost no Yellowcake Flux and not many Ghouls either.  Did get some HRFs from the Super Mutants at the disposal site to the north of WS.
---
It's any savage divide event
---
I heard them talking about this. Confirmed.
---
GT- TheFriskyPete
---
Recon. It has low-light capabilities and a wide field of view. The tracking is occasionally useful.
---
We just had one so I don‚Äôt expect another for a while. Got the holiday stuff coming up, double xp and free to play weekend.
---
It‚Äôs been broke for a while the first star will kick in for like 2 % sometimes but it‚Äôs not worth it there are a lot of better places for the points
---
I wish they added contraptions workshop or automaton type dlc to fallout 76
---
Typically happens to me every Sunday morning to a little after lunch. Not sure if it's server side maintenance or something else but it happens like clockwork every Sunday  between the same times.
---
This has been proven false. She‚Äôs at 32k, from memory, whether you solo or have a full server fighting her.
---
I like fighting people with mutations and strong weapons. I like it when players use the mechanics in the game in battle. If I wanted to PvP without RPG mechanics then I'd go play a game that is a focused shooter.
---
Mutations are fun. They are also optional - if its not fun for you then don't use em. The wasteland is your oyster, play how you want.
---
Ok
---
When I first met them, my first thought was 'They have a name, they must be essential' and proceeded to 1 tap the cat. Felt guilty the rest of the session
---
This would cause new players to lose the ability to experience the lore and things would no lknger have the same kind of impact on them
---
What system?
---
its greyed out because you dont have enough of it raw leather is what you need
---
If you are having problems with the mirelurk kings, rather than the wendigo, try taking the path to the right after entering the cave to avoid the area with the mirelurks.
---
Thanks
---
&gt;Thanks
---
 Thanks
---
Power user 1 and a 50% core will last 6 hours. (Assuming no vats and no jet pack)
---
Batteries included to drop their weight.  Since they are considered ammo, any armor with ammo WR.
---
I dont (Cant) FT, so I walk everywhere; until recently, was too overencumbered to get out of PA, so was in it full time.  (Getting WR armor fixed that problem)
---
anyway, between line in the sand, Camden park, gorge bridge, the various static spawn points/generators.. If I didn‚Äôt pickup another core, I could probably play another 600 hours before I ran out.
---
Hi, I have you in friend list already, but will be home in 20 minutes. Can you wait a bit?
---
A Minigun and a Gatling laser. Those can be strong I guess but I found it strange that I did a lot of damage. I can't remember that I ever did anything more than tickling the SBQ with my handmade rifle.
---
You need to put them down like the mangy rabid raider swine that they are. As a free stater, I don‚Äôt start shit, but I will end it when it comes my way.
---
Yeah. Especially when they think you were born yesterday. And some of the things they say on area chat are pretty funny-trying to get you to attack.
---
No she doesn't have immunity to explosive damage. She has an enchantment on her that makes her only take 30% damage from all source.
---
3rd floor of fort defiance, in the corridor as you get out of the lift, look for them on top of a crate outside one of the bedrooms or bathroom (camp remember which) but def 3rd floor
---
Graham sells the emittor plan
---
I might try it out.
---
That‚Äôs super weird, i guess they must‚Äôve leaked it early :)
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they do another one around Christmas or new years. It seems like they do one about every month or so.
---
Meant recently.
---
Lol. Are you basing that on the damage numbers you saw coming off her? Furious auto handmade is an excellent weapon.
---
Yeah, we quickly abandoned the idea of using vending machines because of incidents similar to what you described.  We put up a display board with each weapon type the player can select and from there we'll drop the weapon with full condition, ammo, and maybe some other goodies like food and water into a drop bag.
---
This is happening to me too. I will look at the turrets and they are for some reason highlighted red like enemy turrets. Within a minute my 10 turrets broke the other 9 turrets by shooting at eachother. Ridiculous waste of scrap trying to fix them and rebuild them. This has happened multiple times to me in the past few weeks. Bethesda please fix this shit.
---
It never gets far enough to tell me which one it is. Chloe is on an endless loop talking about playing hide &amp; seek
---
I usually dont because more time than not its the toxic retardedly op guys. Just like when you take a power plant or the ammunitions factory. It makes pvp so stupid. I had a vampires with ffr gatling laser on a guy who wasnt moving and he still one shot me! It was absolutely stupid.
---
Does he interact with the paper bag when you drop food or is it more of just a role playing thing? I haven‚Äôt been to that location yet
---
I'll have to go look for it tonight, thanks !
---
I hear about people being one shotted, do you run bloodied? As far as I know, max damage is capped at around 110 or so, maybe they run auto handmades
---
Max bloody mess, pretty much every build should max it.
---
They likely added this to disincentivize griefers from killing people and stealing their flux after the event, which is a thing, believe me. The problems with this are, though...
---
* Firstly, for this to work they would actually have to publicly and loudly announce the change so that griefers know, which they didn't;  
---
* Secondly, griefers don't care about getting your flux so much as they do about you losing yours. They don't need the flux, they just want you to lose yours, so this change does nothing to deter them;  
---
* Thirdly, they could just make Scorched Earth Flux a Misc. item you could turn in for crafting flux at your camp via a buildable object that gives you a repeatable quest for flux, like an SBQ flux processor or something.
---
It's a super dumb fix for a bad design error. It drives me crazy that Bethesda employs some of the best environment artists and some of the industry's worst game and systems designers.
---
Yes thank you
---
Not fully because I remember that the damage of furious weapons and buffs are not included in the displayed damage numbers or has this been fixed? 
---
Maybe my aim got better which means that the Furious effect resets less? I used around three clips on the SBQ while it landed and I didn't miss a single shot.
---
I would find it useful if it shoved them back further and staggered them for a few seconds.
---
Well to be fair I did make a post quite a while back saying that you should only be able to use heavy weapons while in PA, and as you can guess it wasn't a very popular opinion! I'd love this game to be more realistic, like only be able to carry 1 weapon and a backup, and no Spongey enemies bit that's a seperate topic altogether.
---
We should definately be able to climb yeah, but it's not gonna happen in this game sadly.
---
As far as the power required for the jetpack, yeah it's farfetched, but this is meant to be an alternate reality what they focused on miniaturising fusion rectors/nuclear power so there's a lot that doesn't make sense to us!
---
Rifleman perks add a whole lot more damage than primed unless you only fight scorched
---
1 and 2 have been answered.
---
 Use weapon artisan when repairing weapons (swap gunsmith out at benches). Luck of the draw is pretty good too, LUK stat.
---
Same here, I don't carry weapons for sale, those are in my camp in my vendor
---
Im not running anything except stealth right now. Im strictly farming right now. And it could been. I kinda wanna try bloodied but im indifferent. I have the money to buy into it regardless of what others say lol. Im just trying to farm for ammo to sell and legendaries at west tek. Every once in while ill do sbq or uranium fever in hopes for something. That's why I dont care to have a better gun cuz my instigating lever action one shots when stealthin with a torso shot on most everything. Combined with gun fu I sweep west tek and lucky hole pretty quick .
---
I believe it WAS fixed a few patches ago. I remember because that was ‚Äòround about the time I got my FE handmade (since replaced by AAE, sadly).
---
That's not from a Canon game as far as I'm aware
---
I just dont need them anymore to one shot everything. No reason to overkill stuff, And I'm not trying to kill a sheepsquatch with a lever action. I use the points on commando instead to make my hand made hot.
---
Kind of strange, but they are pretty plentiful
---
It should. It‚Äôs the same thing. If it‚Äôs not crafting you are missing something else or need a perk.
---
Its like they know theyre stuck in a simulation, so they play the lottery to see who gets to escape the world by death next ü§´
---
Haven't crafted a set in while but this is what I remember. I had around 28 int crafting with night person and berry mentats, unyielding, no marsupial. I crafted and it seems the durability varies a bit on the top end. Couldn't for the life of me get the left x01 leg to match the right in durability- even though they were crafted at the same time. It drove me mad for a while, I think it's impossible to get the legs matched so settled on matching arms. The excavator matched after a few crafts, legs and arms.
---
When you go to put mods on it, even with higher int, the mods drop the durability down. Have no idea why this happens but it does. Fix it good is a must along with white knight for regular armor.
---
I also want to see the Slocum Joe stuff make a return, especially given that it was rather viable with the stats the donuts gave you. In general though it would lead to a string of more road-side camps acting as diners or restaurants.
---
I had the same issue. If after a few days you still don't have it contact support
---
Yeah, plague walker doesn't seem to do anything other than murder small animals.
---
Luck of the draw luck perk is awesome for fast attack weapons..i barely ever have to repair.
---
Looks like it. So much is wrong with this photo haha
---
He's a cat.  Cats don't do anything you want them to.
---
Each wall or panel should be the ‚Äúwire‚Äù. Connecting objects to the walls or panels will power them. 
---
Running wires should be used to connect power from wall to wall over a distance ex: going outside
---
If you do not mind losing some accuracy, then you can improve the durability of guns by using a forceful stock. These give improved recoil and bashing damage, and similarly to the aligned stock, reduce AP cost by 5%.
---
I'm just against PVP altogether in its current form so we're pretty far apart on our opinions I think. 
---
My point is, that marsupial doesn't feel optional at all, it's almost a necessity to keep up with everyone else who uses it. Even during PVE events.
---
There are dog animations.  They circle around and attack you.
---
I run heavy/explosive junkies. Best build in my opinion. I didn‚Äôt finalize it until about lvl 120, I have 39 unused levels now.
---
I think they toned him down from a few patches back. Went in there recently for the wendigo and blew the nuts off the sides of his face.
---
Joining your world at the moment.
---
Need to kill players like that, burn thier camp down. Judt completely over react, full scorched earth.
---
Yeah, happened to me, too.
---
I am at the wendigo cave now
---
Also if you need steel uranium fever works wonders.
---
Im runnin out of levels myself. I wanna try to get grim reapers sprint but idk what perks to take out of...
---
I only have 3 luck
---
A lot of players have just gotten really good at killing her. SBQ fights are about all there is to do in lategame, and their builds are focused on killing her quick. In a given fight you're likely to have at least one person who can solo her in a few minutes.
---
Long Night vision. Carrying the recon is nice for that one quest though.
---
Give him disarmed mines.
---
Gunsmith, not sure don't run a lever anymore. Weapon artisan is good enough for a dps gun. Your sniper shouldn't have a issue
---
Bloody build need a nerf! But anyway I think you miss the point, the game is already too easy. Vats are meant to be a tactical choice, it's not so much the case in this game but older games it was.
---
I killed that stinky stupid ass cat once with a explosive gatling plasma when I still had 76. Stinky murgle
---
Come on now.
---
Hmm
---
Discussion, tell us why.
---
Ohhhh ok thanks so much.. makes so much sense.. I feel so dumb cause I honestly I think I figured that out along time ago messing around with bloodied builds and then forgot it again sometime during my 1200 hours lol.. it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve done any character building
---
Huh, interesting. I run with a bloodied Gauss Rifle (not the strongest of the bloodied longarms, but a one shot killing machine all the same) and I have to repair the thing every once in a blue moon. Basically I get advanced repair kits from events faster than my gun loses durability. I have ranks in Weapon Artisan, but I'm hardly using that perk at this point.
---
How many kills per durability bar do you get, you think? Ballpark estimate?
---
The newer players are easy to spot. Like in train station I ran into one, before I could wave hi he pulled out his gun like was going to take his booty.
---
Yep got kicked last night buddy just got kicked like 15mins ago
---
The way to pass it is entirely a glitch since the armor is not meant to be able to be dropped in the first place.
---
Alright I am off doing my dailies. Have fun!
---
And tell me if you nee something else taken care of. :)
---
Tip; place a doormat, conduit on mat, wire to powersource, move mat a tiny amount two times, the third time you move the mat you can place it anywhere creating a huge wire or straight through objects.
---
Been looking for this exact answer. Thanks !
---
Touch√©
---
Very cool!
---
Thanks!üòÅ
---
Actually all of these are true facts. It does cause instability and crashes. 
---
If you don't believe that people are using them to grief then you are oblivious. There are groups of people who talk about it openly in discords like the demon asylum one.
---
Trading it is an exploit. There is no ifs ands or buts about it. The armor is NOT supposed to be able to be dropped in any manner whatsoever.
---
Had a level 40 request 50cal ammo and I priced it at 1c each and he denied it with the "price too high" option.
---
Say what you will about the Enclave, but we've yet to drag anyone's soul screaming into the abyss.
---
I guess lol
---
No, it's... something else. There's evidence that it's pre-war. Possibly even pre-Columbian. There's a definite Lovecraft vibe to it.
---
Because of how distance shots are nerfed in 76 I‚Äôve actually moved mostly to reflex - which is weird because I usually always like long distance sniping in previous 3D fallout games ...
---
If I am using scopes, I don‚Äôt really like the night vision ones - I prefer normal or recon.  As I said the night vision isn‚Äôt really night vision and is just a Bit weird to me
---
It gets worse the longer you look at it.
---
Are you aware u can hack terminals to turn off the turrets or make them attack the robots? I didn't realize that until like level 100 then immediately did a successful solo. Also be sure to bring a minigun or something to get you out of any binds! U can find launch codes on the internetz
---
We don't know that. As far as we can tell from playing the game, steel and peices can't be traded. Full sets can.
---
Im slowly finding that out. Ive been looking and looking, but much like antivaxxers, i cant find anything credible to support it. Lol. 
---
I thought i remembered seeing it in a terminal in fallout 3 that lists a few vaults, but i may be mistaken there. I probably am. 
---
I found there is a new vegas mod that lets you journey to 79, bit thats obviously not canon, like you mentioned.
---
The fandom has a wiki on 79 that mentions detroit as well, but i assume the fandom wiki is non canon as well.
---
I'm a dataminer. The armor itself cannot be dropped and will be destroyed just like atom shop painted armors. The method is a workaround that was used for the atom shop painted armors as well before that part got patched.
---
No, he doesn‚Äôt care.  I just like animals and wish I could help it.
---
SBQ  event is really weird.
---
You can be there with 6,or 7 high level players and She is a Bullet Sponge and you fail the event.
---
As you say you can be there with 3/4 and easily kill her.
---
I am convinced SBQ has set amount of auto-fails and passes in the Code.
---
This is where I got all my other teddy bears. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
But no pristine this far had appeared, so decision to ask here was made.
---
I used to run from everyone cuz I didn't know how the pvp rules worked just yet... Turns out I didn't need to run away but ya never know lol
---
Yup. . Someone keeps taking bear from Charleston. üòÖ
---
65k hotdogs
---
Even if we could why waste the resources? Frames all over the place
---
I think it might be a unique spawn for the observatory. He keeps going on about the stars.
---
Long Scope.
---
Only because i think the Recon Scope is ugly and makes my 50 Cal Sniper Rifle look Turd.
---
I wish there were more of those tales. Maybe like a weekly thing on our radio.
---
See how you flip flop as long as it suits YOUR wishes...
---
How.lol
---
Do you know where that is?
---
I personally like the bandaging on top of armour. Whenever I bandaged something it was on top of a wound... been doing it wrong this whole time.
---
I wish it was normal like the rest.
---
Seriously Dude you are going to Trigger a whole lot of people :-)
---
Nice camp!
---
I have to ask....did you mean Won Ton, like the dumplings?
---
Lmao what have I missed exactly? Haven't played in months, heard about the subscription thing and apparently not many like it..? Is this like an forbidden topic here or what
---
That sounds amazing, I was thinking on creating my 2nd character inspired by paladin Danse from FO4, using only laser guns &amp; power armor. Making the character to look exactly like him will be the real challenge , prob its gonna take me a few hours lol
---
Assuming your God President AI isnt a mind rip like Valentine's. Being a body less being trapped inside a computer sounds a lot like hell to me.
---
Same is happening on PS4.
---

---
This. I run with excavator exclusively. The extra 200 lbs carry weight (if you spawn in p.a.) over other p.a.is too much to give up for better dmg resist/rad protection.  It takes forever to break and is cheap to fix.
---
I'm curious as to why you picked 9 in perception? Melee focus with a gun option swap out or stats for Nuclear Winter?
---
There's a hill with a copper deposit just north of Poseidon where I built my first base, and I remember seeing a ton of cats there.
---
Wanton passive aggression.
---
Some people have the resources but can't be bothered tracking down a frame, I guess
---
I think no one noticed cause the net was saturated by YouTubers bandwagoning to talk about how bad or how it failed all at once for views :/
---
Yes my point exactly
---
That's part of my point - they were too busy hating the wrong target.
---
It is hard letting go of your stuff.
---
Once you do,it will set you free.......literally.
---
I get it about enjoying the exploring.
---
The down side of being permanently over-encumbered is the drain on AP it always,always happens at the most inappropriate time.
---
I know Wastelanders has companions as a key feature, and I'm seriously hoping some of them are animals and/or eyebots, maybe even a reprogrammed Liberator. I want a pet, damn it!
---
It's actually part of a quest line (That Sinking Feeling, cryptid related) if it's the one I'm think of! It's Scoot's cabin, unmarked on the even after you find it (unless my game is glitched). In the Mire, South of southern Belle Motel.
---
Might rebrand the video to target that most folks don't want to bother with another y fallout failed video despite being about a more interesting viewpoint
---
Not really, what do you mean?
---
ok
---
"Blame Game" is used for that purpose.
---
The Fallout 4 and 76 engines are basically the same, it should be an easy port job.
---
Nah. I‚Äôve done 300+ queens. Never failed one after maybe the first 15 or so. All died In less than 7min but most are way faster. Tweak your build to be a queen killer. That‚Äôs why makes the endgame fun.
---
It's like a Great Dane trying to sleep in a cat bed xD
---
Hey blame the dev's just copying what they made
---
I already found one camp there. I was like that‚Äôs a genius way of making sure you have a pet.
---
I've taken good care of my ps4 and I have it on a table that cannot hold any heat, it's a wire mesh so the table it sits on cant even get a warm spot.  The only time frames were so bad I couldn't play were during the Encryptid and like 8 people went nuts on it.  Other than that its just an obviously lower framerate than my PC which runs it at 60, and the interface is a little slow to respond.  It hasn't been all that bad, I'll add that I have 200meg internet which supports your theory about the network causing such things.
---
Aww god dammit.
---
This is exactly the case. The environment art is wonderfully done but the gameplay and stability issues are real immersion killers
---
This has to the most annoying Bug of the game.Really,really annoying.
---
That and dying and inexplicably being sent back to Vault 76 to re-spawn.
---
I feel your pain kind of. Often I will check the silos and if someone is in them I'll stay in and wait to see if they are going to drop on the queen. Well I just got done playing a few minutes ago, had one in alpha and one in bravo at the same time.  Was waiting to see how the arms race would turn out.
---
I just logged off a minute ago. 1 whole hour and neither had launched yet. I gave up and logged off finally.  I have no problem launching my own, but it's never taken me anywhere near an hour.  Makes me wonder if they were just afk in there or if they really are taking over an hour to launch.  Think I would give up if it took me that long. Lol.
---
Guess if you want something done right you'd better just do it yourself.
---
The furious effect also works now so that is a big thing to
---
OR... It's a bug.
---
It started with me wanting it for Nuclear Winter, but I realized I can swap out for non-automatic rifle damage perks for my Fixer if need be, so it all worked out well :)
---
Quad Western is a nice all around pistol, lots of vats chances per"clip".
---
Not a heavy gunner but first I‚Äôd drop the explosive and pick up a ffr. That‚Äôll give you a 25% dps improvement. Probably prime it as well. Ammo is a bitch but you can run a non-primed gun outside queens. 
---
Sometimes I agree the queen is weird but that‚Äôs the game. Some days my toon is a tank and some days he‚Äôs super spongy. Armor perks don‚Äôt load right. Sometimes they load double. That‚Äôs the game tho.
---
I thought you posted this as a joke.... wow.
---
Meh just saying stuff like that has been played out blame, what went wrong, why it failed that stuff is all in the same vein.
---
FFR on revolvers is pointless its so low that 25% adds 1 to the fire rate, explosions 4tw, or vats rolls
---
I don‚Äôt even accept requests. It‚Äôs just people wanting my stuff for nothing. I‚Äôll back out and then they‚Äôll follow me around being annoying
---
Alright Ill keep it in mind.
---
So you're dismissing it outright on a flimsy technicality?
---
It totally is a joke but the arm wraps are a thing from the actual game.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Might play about a bit.That is the beauty of this game.Being able to try new things.
---
Does it really matter. I just get garbage anyway lol
---
If you have space- bloody mess, and adrenaline as high as you can afford. Stabilized and one gun army can help, but don't add much damage, just accuracy, armor penetration (so kinda more damage), and chance to cripple and stagger.
---
Good video... ‚ÄúI kinda like it‚Äù
---
There are many players on FO76 who followed the franchise back from release of FO2 and FO3.  The understanding of how VCs work is ‚Äúout there‚Äù in the community.
---
Wish there were more balanced videos like yours.
---
Thank you! 
---
Wanton is how you'd pronounce it in Cantonese. It originated from the Cantonese as well.
---
Only ranged weapons can drop with extra bashing damage
---
That's reality lol if it's got the same title it's probably the same rehashed content. I'd hate for peoples hard work to be dismissed cause of that cause I like new interesting opinions.
---
Would be easy to fix on Bethesda‚Äôs side,
---
‚ÄúBashing an enemy increases the damage they take by 20% for 3 seconds‚Äù
---
Then watch it, because very few people are talking about this, and even fewer dive into the numbers.
---
One time when my friends and I found Murgle in the shack, my friend accidentally dropped his controller and punched the poor car with a legendary power fist. Accidentally blew a leg off and was the most graphic thing we‚Äôve ever seen. RIP Murgle
---
Pretty sure we have stuff straight from 4s CC
---
I was just coming here to say the same. I have it maxed out and it repairs almost every other shot. Very handy perk.
---
I‚Äôve been hearing jiggle bells too. It‚Äôs subtle. I thought I was going nuts.
---
I think you killed the cat &amp; get off on bragging to the world about it
---
Simple solution,  put stable flux in the Aid tab, problem solved,  but I am 100 percent sure that solution would escape Bethesda.
---
Eagle eyes mutation
---
Makes sense. Upvoted.
---
Hells yeah, good work, fellows!
---
Yes
---
NPCs not yet. Pets kinda.
---
Google or search in this sub reddit. People asking about the state of the game everyday.
---
Level 75 on my 3rd go at the game.  Over 2250 scrip worth of drops to this point in the game.  Not a single rifle of ANY kind including 1500 scrip spent on \*\* RANGED weapons at the purveyor during sale.
---
Its my worst game RNG wise of the 3 goes at the game.  I thought the other two attempts were bad.
---
I just wish there where more light up signs in general but on that note What happened to vim and where's the nuka workbench?
---
It is post war. What are you saying though?
---
I‚Äôve just started another play through and went bloodied this time. I keep a low level gamma gun on me in case of emergencies that way I can shoot my feet.
---
Thanks. Appreciated.
---
Yep, but then it also breaks from 200% condition after about 30 seconds of hitting something with max gunsmith. I have a zealot's bashing damage shredder minigun I use to slap the queen's face, and while it absolutely demolishes her it's done so fast it puts erectile dysfunction to shame
---
I feel yeah... I walk around with diseases on me all the time, and being mutated to where I spread damage to living things around me, even Murgle wouldn't stand a chance...
---
Yes... I'm a monster *sob*üò≠*sob*
---
üòâ
---
I believe OP is referring to actual frames, not displays for PA parts.
---
I just don't get why the "Assassins" prefix still exists ... no point if there isn't any PvP mode.  Just a waste of another useless legendary item now.  Makes it even harder to get anything worth while if they keep eliminating items with value.  
---
Even bringing in "The Fixer" as a possible drop, doesn't help if the Fixer plans are impossible to get.
---
Pure pay to win experience.
---
Which rare outfits because I‚Äôm looking for the cowboy outfits.
---
Haha you're right, I read the post about 2 minutes after I woke up
---
I have an instigating bash damage fat man. Surprisingly fun to use, I got it as a drop way back in like December or January and I still had it on me last time I played
---
I've gotten Responders Fireman Outfit twice while farming for Plan: Laser Gun Medium Scope. I don't have a spare Western
---
I love this spot. I encountered Murgle a few months ago while chasing a cargo bot and I immediately placed my camp and have been running the Kitten Cafe every since
---
The Hellfire armor, yeah.
---
I miss Dogmeat.  Game isn't the same without him.  Gross oversight in my mind to make a Fallout game without him/her.
---
Darn, well I hope you find your plans.
---
Tuesday you will be able to not have people join if you don‚Äôt want
---
As far as i know, B2515r, and a couple others to a lesser extent were duped on pc, but it was a pc only thing so if youre on console, no.
---
I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve been duped. They go for a lot and ones people are looking for rarely come up or don‚Äôt seem to be available because huge offers don‚Äôt bring any forward.
---
This is from my Xbox experience.
---
Dont they still drop from imposter?
---
As others have stated: it's the explosive that's hurting your DPS. She's resistant to the explodo.
---
Honestly, a Bloodied Explosive Fixer's going to be worth a ton, duped or no.
---
Did you get to see what were causing those earthquakes? üëÄ
---
I will when this new Event starts on the 12th! Only got 7 Plans left to find and they're all in either the Ultra Rare or Ultra Stupid conditions category. Good luck with the Western Outfit. Are you on PC? I can help you look.
---
I'm working up a few lvl 1 .50 cal hunting rifles to kick over to you guys for this.
---
U fixed it. gj with that vid.  in the end commercialization has killed YouTube and fo.
---
Well, Mad Max was a big inspiration for the Fallout franchise, so...
---
Not yet, but they're going to be added in the very near future, sometime between January and April.
---
You could say, in other words, that it's pay to win.
---
This is why I run ghoulish rad resistant and Sun kissed it buys a bit extra time even more with pharmacist favorite radaway spam a couple and run like you're about to crap your pants.
---
Canned coffee helps too.
---
No shame in being helpful; keep fighting the good fight.
---
I'm wanting the Holiday Season pack. So damn cool and Festive. üéÑüéÅü¶å
---
Fixers were definitely duped on the PC.
---
On PS4 you can set your PSN status to "Appear Offline," then block for session so that you don't appear online in-game.
---
I don't know about Xbox or PC.
---
It's just behind the Beckwith farm, I believe, walk through the farm with the broken down shed on the left (watch out for big monster lizards), head to the cliff and I THINK you'll see it there.
---
Where is this cat? I need to take a picture of a cat.
---
Is that globe accurate to all known nuke sites?
---
I used Unyielding because my argument was that there are 2 types of Stealth in Fallout 76: Chameleon/PvP Stealth and Sneak/PvE stealth. Agility points increase your Sneak, and Unyielding armor gives you more Agility.
---
Turrets are essentially blind and buggy. They have low natural Perception and have been modified several times by Bethesda since the game launched, including modifications to player detection. They would not make for a reliable test subject. I used a Level 91 Deathclaw because they have very high, very reliable Perception. Scorchbeasts woukd be a good alternate test subject, except that they spawn Scorched followers on the ground, which skews your test results.
---
When I did my test, I wasn't testing whether Chameleon is better than nothing at all. I was testing whether Chameleon or Sneak hid me from NPCs. Chameleon + No Sneak = completely visible to the Deathclaw. No Chameleon + High Sneak = Hidden from the Deathclaw.
---
Besides needing a better NPC to test against, you'd also want to make sure your character's Agility stat is as close to 1 as you can manage, otherwise you'll be skewing your results because your Agility is a Sneak enhancement. I'd re-run your test with the Deathclaw at the TM-02 substation north of Watoga. See if you can fool him with 1 Agility and 5 Chameleon pieces. A lot of people died in Survival because they tried to do exactly that. The Deathclaw saw right through their Chameleon and killed them whenever they tried to assault my CAMP.
---
You can skip these quests for a level or so until you have the materials. Or just head to Flatwoods and kill a few Brahmin for skins.  
---
Once you get done with the Airport quests, you will want to stop following the quests until you get to a higher level. I recommend leveling at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary, Grafton Dam, and Grafton Steel until you hit level 20+.
---
That‚Äôs one of my least favorite, the voice is just so weezy sounding, I don‚Äôt know, just don‚Äôt like it.
---
1) Little to no latency.
---
2) Workshops without contest.
---
3) No competition for static spawn items.
---
4) Less to no lag in Vault and Queen fights.
---
5) Freedom to navigate events without being obstructed by no-team-work types.  
---
6) Never have issues with your CAMP location being taken.
---
Here are my data notes
---
SBQ Data
---
Health is fixed at 32,767. Does not scale to the number of players in event.
---
DR 300. ER 300
---
Defense Modifiers- reduces incoming damage by 70%, then applies armor. 
---
Immune to radiation. 
---
Weapon Prefix Damage Compatibility-  Zealots, Hunters
---
You have to take a picture of Murgle for a badge quest.
---
Fort defiance, aside from that pretty much any military installation will have at least 1.
---
You used to be able to farm it in the cranberry bog, hitting up all the BOS outposts. That and the fort down there should keep you in stock for  awhile
---
Prolly not lol honestly
---
It's a bit rare as far as materials go I think. You can find it in ammo pouches at the surface to air sites and maybe the silos. I horde it myself because I always need it for armor repairs and mods. I'm sure others here will have more input
---
The only way the game rewards those outfits is all of them together. Yes, it is rare to get the reward but anyone else who's been rewarded those also got all of them at once
---
She‚Äôll scorch you üòÇ
---
No they weren't duped on console and as a guy who had one and was fully built for it the explosive version sucked explosive consistently broke sneak, again perked out with weightless ap and sneak set. So I dumped it and kept using me FFR handmade, just some hands on experience for you.
---
When you miss, you don't get a hit marker. If the OP missed, it wouldn't give a hit marker. Your argument is irrelevant if you keep ignoring the facts. Maybe you don't have your hit markers turned on. They tell you how much damage you did to an enemy. If you miss, nothing happens. If you hit, it shows how much damage you caused. Hitting someone and getting 0 for the hit marker in NW means you hit and caused 0 damage. That shouldn't be happening with the Gauss Rifle.
---
I had this happen when they dropped nuclear winter. I tried just about everything and the only thing that fixed it was to uninstall and reinstall
---
You used to be able to do that, but they took that option out months ago. If someone asked for something you didn't want to sell, you could cancel the offer.
---
This is a internet issue. Maybe your ISP or your router is failing.
---
I use a combat knife for the same purpose.  It must be a sniper thing.
---
They're literally all over the map. Figure out where one is, then go there when you need one.
---
Jesus fucking christ... Who are you people?
---
it will be difficult with my internet connection :(
---
I buy it from the robot venders when I'm at max caps, and want to open my shop.
---
It would honestly be nice to hear "Haunting Melody" and "Hush Hush Hush, here comes the boogey man" be added, but those are a bit too old for Fallout's style of music.
---
They don‚Äôt span to muck in the private server. And, like I sad here before, I‚Äôm to lazy to go looking for some. I have a lot of resources, why can‚Äôt I just craft it?
---
Got that drop once from one violent night.
---
I carry a weightless ffr gamma gun on me (renamed the GeigerCounter) in case I need to proc nerd rage or for when I need to scrap items for mods. Toxic water (different from dirty water) is another good way to get some rads in a pinch.
---
Ok so I might be better off looking for a BFFR one then, thanks for the info.
---
It's not a lot but there are usually 3 at Camp McClintock. Military tape &amp; pouch in the lobby area &amp; 1 more pouch in the transport around back.
---
One of my team mates died after the queen and I couldn't get to his bag in time. Someone took his flux from the bag and left the rest of the junk. 
---
I think you are experiencing a bug or someone took just the flux. I'm pretty sure B would have told us if they changed it so flux wouldn't drop upon death.
---
The only way to currently prevent specific items from being seen by others in trade is by applying a custom skin.  
---
I would like to stress that dropping an item with a custom skin gives a single warning, and then destroys the skinned item once dropped...  forever.
---
lol negative agility won‚Äôt turn you into a sloth, it just means something is having a negative impact on that stat.
---
Yep. Or a 3* one with less AP and vats stats or LmbDmg would probably suffice as a work horse piece as a bloodied sneak build. I honestly believe the less AP cost is key for the fixer.
---
I had this happen to me the other day... Make sure your Xbox Gold is renewed lol. It happens when you aren't able to sign into your Live account.
---
This is my trap:
---
https://imgur.com/a/GVY16oa
---
When people are busy checking weapons and armors at the shop, I remove the floor so they fall inside the trap.
---
Camp Venture has one; it's in the room you need a code to open (with the Overseer chest in it), along the back wall above an ammo can.
---
I agree I wish they had a black version for hunting rifles ...
---
In other games everything works correctly
---
im gonna say 60-80 kills per and its broke again
---
Are legacy weapons permanently gone, or will there be explosive laser drops again in the future?
---
You can't consume Stable Flux, so it can't go in the Aid tab.
---
Orang
---
Yes it does, we get two and it hits near Perth and Sydney. It's like the first thing I checked when I built it.
---
I had a camp near the Murgle cafe. Occasionally you will find him/her dead as a door nail, but at other times Murgle is just stretched out asleep. I would love a camp cat. Especially if it occasionally killed rad rats.
---
No he is correct. Stabilized flux is lost on death. I've experienced it twice myself.
---
I'm pretty sure they are actually duped on console the is a guy named garret on Facebook that has stacks of these guns
---
I don't think this was a design error. This is what happens when people complain about PvP. Bethesda tries to appease them. The real solution is for Bethesda to remind everyone that Pacifist mode exists to avoid the PvP handshake in the first place, accidental or otherwise. You can't be griefed without the handshake.
---
You can't go below 0 on a stat.
---
You need to scrap some stuff.
---
If you are in excavator, you can carry up to 1720#, adn you can only have 800 in you stash. Add the two. thats your max weight.
---
You will not be able to pick up or buy anything until you drop/scrap/sell items to get under that number.
---
If you have wanted legendaries scrip them in the machine,
---
Scrap junk And weapons at the tinker workbenh in the trainstation.
---
Alos, check your inventory for loose PA parts.  If the parts have been removed from the frame, thats well over 50# aditional for each PA frame in your carry inventory.
---
see if that helps.
---
Yes they were as well as the AAFFR LVC Handmade
---
Its time to greet the new player with open arms and by open arms i mean the safety on my gun turned off
---
Have you tried reinstall. How old is your XB. Sometimes games just crash on certain XB's .. I have two and 1 game crashes on one and not the other ..
---
Try delete your game and try again .. sounds like you may be SOL .. also you can wait for the next update, delete the game and try again, maybe a bug ..
---
First try delete your game data before deleting the game if it allow you to, manage game and delete data. Sorry you having issues.
---
Rarely.  And no one plays imposter any more, so even more rare.
---
My first go through, I had 5 Fixer plans at the same time through 25 events in two days.  
---
Second go through 20 play throughs to get a single Fixer plan in just over a month of play time.
---
Third play though, 4 months, have only seen the event run 3 times.  Once it was so glitchy that it gave NO reward at all.
---
thank you all.
---
My xbox is 4 years old. Ill wait for the update, if it doesn‚Äôt work, then ill reinstall the game
---
Make cat soup
---
Maybe make a mod that auto-swings, like a motorized hinge thing that's gives it faster fire rate lol
---
That suck we are always looking for more dps for imposter in my group
---
Wow, if you're that lazy how do you manage to even turn the game on?
---
I haven‚Äôt been so luck yet.  I didn‚Äôt play for about 3 months this past summer.
---
How many do you need?
---
1 in one of the two barracks buildings as well.
---
I‚Äôm lazy to do useless stuff. But I get blood in my eyes when we need to go to vault 94, the queen or any other big challenge
---
pete hines and every member of the zenimax board of executives can suck my dick
---
This would be amazing, I've been hoping for this for a while
---
I've never had this happen to me. I'll have to check it the next time we do a queen on a private server.
---
A few to block the path sor some mobs in Vault 94. Is like a barrier to protect you and your team. Pro tio there bro!  ;)
---
My BE laser breaks if you look at it the wrong way
---
It keeps the cats from unrolling tp everywhere.
---
Oh, I've never done a single vault raid, sounds pants.
---
I think you're making some assumptions in your investigation, which will lead you to make and miss connections and skew your results.
---
Assume that the Interloper followers, the Cult of the Mothman, the Cryptid Hunters, and the Alien conspiracy theorists are 4 separate groups.
---
There's no need to assume any hostility between the Responders and the Cult of the Mothman. The Responders were trying to help and work with everyone, including the Raider factions. Their presence in Point Pleasant doesn't make it a Responder town, just like their presence in Harper's Ferry didn't change the fact that Harper's Ferry is a Free States stronghold. The Responders are neutral and will work with anyone who is willing.
---
There is an Interloper site at Tanagra Town in the Mire. I've come across several sites - the common items linking them is a chalk drawing of a turtle, the giant metal heads, crystal deposits, and those tree artifacts. There is a church in the Forest area that has some of these tree artifacts as well.
---
Also, look up the definition of the word "Interloper"... I think that's a bit of a clue in itself.
---
Literally all of that just some fantasy you pulled out of thin air... just because you choose to not interact with other players doesn‚Äôt make the game not a multiplayer.  This is literally a multiplayer fallout, the lore has literally nothing to do with it - the lore is the game world not the game type. The words from todd howards mouth when he announced the game was we wanted to see what our type of game would be like with multiplayer - this is a core game mechanic the game was built as a multiplayer experience... not something added on at the end of the game for ‚Äúshits and giggles‚Äù when they first started working on it they knew it was multiplayer...
---
You're willing to farm mats to build armour. You'd be willing to farm mats if you could build a PA frame, but you are too lazy to FT to 1 of many locations where there are frames?!?
---
S√≥, you are what some people call Nutella player. No offense there a man, you can play anyway you want.
---
All very valid! The no latency and not ever having an item your looking for already being looted is great!!!
---
Maybe it happens once it goes oast one of the bars.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Literally unplayable. &gt;=[
---
Never heard that before!
---
Ohhh thanks for the clarification, I thought it was more along the lines of every 50 levels we got a redeemable credit to use for what perk we wanted to keep. That makes a lot more sence because I didn't trust Bethesda handling my theory lol
---
You get a 10-second invulnerability window after each respawn. Protects you from rads. If this happens to me, I just take out my power armor, hop into it, die, and then respawn in the power armor. You can also fast travel away, but that's less reliable.
---
If you want to AVOID this problem in the first place, remember that when you respawn, you respawn at the closest map marker to where you died. Don't stray from the radiation-free map marker.
---
Thanks for watching!  I think I made the title of this post too subtle, people aren't actually getting it's a humor thing :)
---
Yeah, me neither until this morning. They say is the guys that don‚Äôt play the hard part of the game, just the easy stuff.
---
1. 100% Repair to 150% Repair
---
2. If Hunters works (I believe it does) thats +30% Damage, AA is 28(ish)%
---
3. I have/ Use an Ultracite Gatling Laser at the SBQ and If I start at 200% and go through 3 Cores (Approx 3600 shots) I'll end the fight with about 60-70% CND left. That's with Gunsmith 5.
---
4. Solo player, so can't comment with authority, but Stranger in Numbers would be a guess.
---
I just chase after new players wearing a straight jacket and faschnet mask wielding a chainsaw.
---
Then I give them fully modded out leather armour, hunting rifle, ammo, food, water and stimpaks.
---
Then I throw a Molotov at my feet before charging off into the forest again.
---
Two, a military duct tape outside and an ammo bag inside.
---

Literally 'unpliable'
---
2 of the challenges yesterday were bugged: Level Up While... and Kill 20 Creatures While...
---
The bug was that you didn't need to meet any of the requirements specified after "While" - you got the Atom points just for killing 20 creatures or leveling up.
---
I‚Äôll have to save a gamma gun the next time I find one.  I usually sell gamma rounds so I‚Äôll pull them from the vending machine.
---
Behind you.
---
If Australia was turned into an apocalyptic wasteland filled with dangerous creatures intent on killing you would anyone notice?
---
I read after i wrote that, that ur theory might be right :(
---
So everything that was already in Fallout 4 but paid via subscription in 76. It just works
---
Nope!
---
The vendor discounts have a cap. You've reached the cap once you can sell a Serum for 500 caps or buy the Assaultron Recall item for 1750 caps.
---
I use an instigating explosive western (primed) with no pistol perks and it One shots most enemies. Pistols are great. Low weight and very ammo efficient.
---
I have been doing this, but only by putting up ammo for free in my shop. 
---
You guys are doing gods work.
---
Wow, I‚Äôve never not had the materials to do those early quests at the camp.
---
Just pick up all junk early on and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
The Brahmin at flatwoods respawn pretty much straight away and are a great source of early food, Brahmin milk and leather.
---
I think you need 6 leather to craft a chest piece so just keep getting more.
---
There are also some animal hides around flatwoods that Will breakdown to leather.
---
So I‚Äôm better off crafting new armor then trying to repair my existing armor.
---
I‚Äôve had treat before; back out of the server and try again
---
Yeah. This is some game breaking shit.
---
It's a cylinder it doesn't have an upside or downside.
---
I like how people have a problem with this when walmart has them sideways...
---
I mean, you literally can run wires through your walls, radiate power through walls, and run conduits through walls. This isn't a matter of it being impossible, it's a matter of you need to watch more YouTube lol :)
---
There is a firing range in game, and they've started to use instancing, so it's possible.
---
Highly unlikely, but possible.
---
This makes sense in light of the alleged insider saying that the devs were not at all happy about Fallout 1st being pushed out in its current state.
---
It's great for farming.
---
Well done boys, it nice to see community spirit. 
---
If you wouldn't mind letting the newbies know the rules about shooting high  level players, because you give them a gun. It might not be in there best interests. Lol. 
---
The reason I say this, is because every time I went to approach a  newbie player with a gift bag, with out first  messaging them, they would unexpectedly start shooting at me, and trying to kill me. Even if I used the emotes, they still didn't seem to get it. Lol. 
---
I would rather not have to teach them a lesson, so they  didn't have to learn the hard way. 
---
Normally I would just fast travel, and leave. But nonetheless they would sometimes track me down, and harass me to know end. And then I would have to lay down the wrath of Jesus on them. 
---
I really don't like being a dick. 
---
Camp McLintock.
---
Fort Defiance
---
There is one definite spawn in a military vehicle at both watoga and westtek respectively.
---
The various army/fire camps around the cranberry bog usually have 1 each too.
---
Remember to always use the perk that makes it cheaper to repair armour (white knight?) and also the one that allows you to repair it to 200% health.
---
I don‚Äôt use white knight outside of this even though it makes armour degrade slower but you could.
---
Ever read ‚ÄúOn the Beach?‚Äù It‚Äôs the rads that get them. :)
---
Oh right! Well I just don't think it sounds very fun, I was Hoping vaults would be deep atmospheric sites for exploration and mystery. But seems like a frantic timed event with rewards that don't seem worth it! To me at least.
---
Thanks!  We're only giving away weapons for level 1 thru 5 characters only.  We may throw in some level 10 weapons they can use later.  Everything we're handing out at this shop is free, no selling of anything.  No vending machines either.  People can walk up and select one of the weapons we have on the display board.  Right now it looks like we'll be handing out pipe guns, BOS sniper rifles, pump shotguns, 10 mm pistols and 44 pistols.  Ammo will be handed out also.  We'll most likely hand out machetes too.  Thanks much for all your help!!
---
Oh yeah, and as said, robot vendors sell it in bulk (well some do).  
---
I tend to buy acid and ballistic fibre in bulk whenever I see them for conveniences sake.
---
Thank you to everyone! i finally found a damn wendigo
---
That sounds more like a "you" problem, not a "game" problem.
---
I once dreamt that me and my usual team were fighting off hordes of ghouls in the moonshiners shack. I‚Äôd been playing a mix of fallout and black ops 2 zombies
---
I never say that it was a game problem. But they could have us the option. And maybe add some mods options to it. ;)
---
I know. Some people don‚Äôt like it. But I do. I don‚Äôt do it for the reward. Just for the challenge
---
Yes! LOL
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a dummy or something in that range that wound display dmg number and being able to change the dmg resist for different results
---
One of the reasons we built the shop in the picture across from the Overseeer's Camp.  It's well lite with a neon sign proclaiming free guns.  It will be up to the new players if they want to come over and take advantage of our free goods.  It they have their audio on, they will hear me inviting them to come over, etc.   Thank for your support!
---
Thank you!!
---
Before last week I had not fast travelled since March. On any of my 5 chars. So, probably over 1100 hours spent ground pounding. Found lots of small camps and stuff. Also started drinking nukashine a couple months ago just for the randomness :).
---
Yeah, and I mean, the game can calculate and display the numbers "on the fly", so putting them in one, readable format wouldn't be the end of the world...
---
I might try it so i can feel like the Mandalorian lol
---
Yup, IGN TK84
---
I was about to say the same thing. Lol
---
There's also a couple radstags hanging by the camp near Flatwoods. Their hides will scrap to leather.
---
Here's how I would fix the Tesla Boi players who have no skills:
---
1) Set the Arc effect of the Tesla to treat other players as friendly, even in PvP. They can still use it for PvE, but it won't arc to human players, the same way it doesn't arc to like... Grahm or a trash can. Make them aim or use VATS, just like everyone else. 
---
2) Apply the same Stealth Boy nerf from NW to the Stealth Boy and Stealth Boy Mark III in Adventure. This would make it so that as soon as a Tesla Boi chump opens fire, they lose their Stealth Boy. Better still, set a parameter so that if a player is engaged in PvP, Stealth Boys cause gradual radiation damage to the user. This is consistent with the lore, because Stealth Boys do cause harm to the user.
---
Makes a lot of sense! I think until the next big Bethesda game suffers from low preorders due to the fallout 76 mess, that will cause them to rethink
---
All of the BoS outposts around the Cranberry Bog have some.
---
There are like 2 places on the map that give you that disease, and you have to be very careful and very patient. It took my friends and I about 30 minutes to get the disease.
---
Hopefully in Wastelanders. I could have sworn they talked about possible pets.
---
The Clowder of Murgle is always happy to read of when people find their pawesome leader for the first time.
---
He does like to play dead sometimes though. Good thing he has been blessed with more than nine lives!
---
You are more than welcome, keep up the great work.
---
Let me guess, you're trying to get the diseases for the 80 Atom Point challenge? If so, Congrats. The challenge is bugged! You've already completed it. Once you acquire the final disease, it changes Sludge Lung back to unacquired. The good news is you CAN get it again. The bad news is that acquiring Sludge Lung again will not complete the challenge.
---
Try swapping the mods for a higher durability because hardened drops it like nothing then use weapon artisan gunsmith and luck of the draw.
---
I think it's True stocks that usually give a nice boost
---
Sorry man, I got no stimpaks.
---
Oh... Really?.. I am also missing woopsies
---
I have been through both large and small groups.
---
I have noticed that the smaller groups had larger number of mobs than the larger groups. For instance the other day I was on a private server with about 6 people and the mobs of random enemies including 4 2* legendary SB was insane and that's not including the Queen. I ended up having to leave the fight cause all 6 of my weapons broke during the fight
---
I go to a public server with about 12 people at the fight and it seemed like the mobs were cut in half, my guess is that the Queen is a bitch to take down either way it's the mobs that make it a really shit show.  that's just from my own personal experience in sure others have much different takes on it
---
Fallout *Minecraft* edition. 
---
Yes, we should be able to rebuild the world, and make it better.
---
my vendor has cores
---
I'm on Xbox if anyone wants
---
Rebuilding includes fancy ass rugs?
---
This. Source: wife owns 7 cats
---
I get mine from McClintock and there are two ammo bags at the transmitter tower up the hill from flatwoods. Other than that I buy it from the vendors in whitesprings if I'm desparate
---
i headshotted murgle through vats 
---
was hungry
---
Misc. tab would be the tab, not Aid. I think personally it should only be obtainable in a dropped bag, not a death bag. If they can make the animations recognize which bag is which, maybe they can make what drops in the bags the same way. I have no issues with people taking my shit if I die... but sometimes, its a dick move.
---
I see people craft the strangler armor and trade those since the armor is still dropable
---
Make sure you use white knight whenever repairing armor obviously
---
I did on my other character and through everything out because I didn‚Äôt need them. Didn‚Äôt realize their rarity haha
---
I can't remember if it was a feature in 3, but in New Vegas weapons would show their damage and their dps, switching the displayed stat every few seconds.
---
That'd be easier to implement, but doesn't work with the "Enemy" part of it.
---
LOL yeah xD
---
If Murgle died it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre still waiting for the jet packs fix. #fixjetpacks #savemurgle
---
It rarely is a reward for project paradise. If you use chemist/super duper you will get significatly more when you craft
---
Probably because people would leave them everywhere
---
That makes sense
---
I am using all the craft cards, with 12 flowers i get about 30-38 radshields but i just feel like it's not that much, how many project paradise give you ?
---
Yes I am
---
Ha doubt it. Wastelander is going to be like fallout 1st. Come back and upvote this when wastelanders come out if I'm right
---
The problem isn't that Pacifist players get placed with non-Pacifist players. It's that people either don't know about Pacifist mode or they turn it off.
---
I used to run investigations where I'd have to read between the lines and find the truth that people weren't saying. For example, if someone said "the guy came out of nowhere," that's not true. People don't "come out of nowhere." What the person is really saying is, "I didn't see him." It's a subconscious attempt to avoid accepting any fault for the outcome of a bad situation, and most people do it.
---
The same thing happens when I see people complaining about PvP. They say the other guy killed them again and again. Or the other guy just killed them without initiating PvP. We know that a person can't be killed again and again without a PvP-initiating handshake such as shooting back or seeking revenge, and we know that a PvP handshake can't take place while in Pacifist (unless you're on a team with another player who does the handshake on behalf of the team). Therefore, the PvP complaints here are always hiding the truth: the people doing the complaining either wilfully chose to engage in PvP or they unknowingly engaged in PvP of ignorance of the PvP mechanics, such as workshop PvP, teammate PvP handshakes, and avoiding PvP handshakes through Pacifist mode.
---
An education campaign and ignoring the people who are trying to avoid accepting responsibility for seeking revenge and such, would be far more effective than trusting Bethesda to change major mechanics of the game.
---
If you're a bloodied, non-PA build you can very easily get ganked with a nuke mine because the rads kill you even if you haven't initiated PvP. Happened to me a few times recently, WITH pacifist on. That stops 99% of PvP, but exploits still kill.
---
Sure, in that case it makes sense.
---
Could you share how you fixed it for future reference?
---
Make it like scorched earth. Nuke Grafton to reveal that the mayor of Grafton is a communist infiltrator that the whole server needs to blast into a million pieces. He needs a proper burial. The mayor that is, not the soldier.
---
Good video. I hope it gets some traction because I think you're right on all of it.
---
I'd also say you should consider doing more investigative stuff like this. I find it pretty interesting and would definitely subscribe.
---
The bsement of the Charleston power plant i think has the best spawn for them i think 3 unruptured
---
Honestly, I just played Fallout 4 for a few hours and then retried it later. Ha.
---
Well there you go, there are at least two frames at Watoga. Atleast. I've seen three, one even spawned at the station.
---
I def wouldnt want to pay for it twice, it should be a freeport dlc thru the atomic shop, but FO4 coffee and donuts were huge
---
Ok just got the disease from a Wendigo screaming at me. You're right, it didn't even register
---
Yes both of these works out
---
We had to crouch down and move with the ball to see it.
---
I'm not sure if I'm horrified or not.
---
I'll let you smell my power armor for 50 caps.
---
From what I read, they found a clever way to feed the purveyor caps instead of script. That's why so many fixers were rolled early. I personally rolled 3 fixers (legit of course), 2 were pretty damn good too.. AA with vats and F with 10% while aiming. Lately, rolling ass so stopped collecting scrip for now.
---
The only thing I would like is a months notice that way I can apply for time off for these double experience point days, I'll get two days this time but will miss the rest thanks to working Nightshift security.
---
Damn it.. that's the third time in 2 weeks this has happened to other players. I've been grinding events for months on 2 characters and the best I've gotten is a 2 star legendary chest piece.
---
Well done on a good drop!
---
Sludge Lung you can get from Wendigos, I believe. You can also get it from some of the toxic air in the Ash Heap. Low Endurance and taking RadAway helps reduce your immunity. For some reason, I've noticed that wearing any headgear at all prevents me from suffering from toxic air. I have one helluva bandana!
---
Woopsies can be acquired from Diseased Mirelurk Spawns in the Mire. Kill all of the regular Mirelurks and the Queen, as well as the non-diseased Spawns, then let the rest go to town on you. Bring Stims. Make sure any defensive mutations are off (Rad-X disables mutations for 10 minutes).
---
Makes sense.
---
Ill have to check em out. Im accumulating a playlist.
---
Just got Sludge Lung from the progenitor Wendigo. It didn't register. I have it in my effects, it said i have contracted sludge lung but it's still unmarked in the challenge.
---
Will try to get wooopsies but it seems that this challenge is also bugged.
---
You'll have higher durability than the stuff you collect in the wild. Fix it good should keep condition good. It's not really durability as maybe you're thinking. It adds more 'hitpoints'. The condition bar will get longer on crafted armor.
---
You‚Äôre not alone there. I found the grave of a child this summer and it just broke me. I had to step away for months.
---
Same here. I worked really hard to complete that challenge. I had 21/22 diseases. As soon as I got #22 (Woopsies) it still said 21/22. When I looked at the list, Woopsies was completed, but Sludge Lung was set to incomplete again. Getting Sludge Lung again didn't change anything.
---
If you're feeling flush with caps, ammo vending machines sell it in bulk for 350ish caps. Lucky for me, vengeful mothman has been attacking me every other session or so. Not sure what his deal is.
---
I will report it yo Bethesda now.. If they care to fix it
---
DAoC and EQ2 had test dummy options for players. DAoC had them on their test server and EQ2 let you build them in guild houses. Would love some kind of similar option here.
---
Be honest. How much nukashine were you on, and what did you think she looked like before you sobered up?
---
Too much nukashine?
---
LMAO xD
---
Use a melee weapon, im at level 34 and if i dont spend most of my time farming i run out of ammo and stimpacks.
---
I want to use that charisma perk that lets you bring animals to my camp to bring that camp to my camp
---
If you have 1st you can claim all three power plants on a private server. You can get 8 cores per hour from each. I do this for an hour or so and usually only have to go refill every month or so. Power user makes them last forever
---
They can't remove it from Junk because it's stored in the scrapbox.
---
I see where you could come to that conclusion perhaps. I'd see it as more resetting their lvl and perks. It just cant see them taking all your un locked plans away, and wipe your CAMP. I dunno, though, who k ows about anything anymore in this crazy world.
---
I mean thats how the actual Patent for Toilet Paper displays.  So thats technically the  "correct way"
---
Scrap everything that isn't bolted down. At that lvl you can use any weapons so do. Make use of all your ammo. Later on you'll want to pick a weapon type but early game it doesn't matter. I just use a weapon till it breaks then find another and scrap the broken one.
---
Lol I like how he didn't know what to do early on
---
Surprisingly... nuclear holocaust is a downer
---
As long as they don‚Äôt start duping quantums is all good lol
---
Yes! I also received the urban and forest scout masks along with the BoS, whitespring, and white powder jumpsuits as a reward for guided meditation around late September
---
I hate the purveyor. All I usually get is broadsiders and black powder shit as weapons and trapper or leather armor.
---
Ah that's right.  Feel like there may possibly be one at the live fire drill area where you fight robots as well. Make sure to grab all the clipboards too for springs.
---
Goatslegs perk already does what you want for fall dmg, just without the animation
---
A whole area of people dying to a plague?  Nothing sad about that...
---
I got the shielded plan from census violence a couple weeks ago.
---
Google search resources map fallout 76.
---
Kill, scrap repeat. 
---
Scrapper perk is a must (not sure what level that be attained)
---
Yup this. Needed Protected first of cause.
---
Sorry - patent shows ‚Äúover‚Äù is the correct intended installation position   Check out the original Wheeler patent
---
Turning down your textures will help more than turning off shadows. If you can't play the game on medium and yet a decent FPS then you need to upgrade your hardware and no amount of turning anything down will help.

Ty but going to stash it for the moment with my high value trades üòÅ
---
On my alt, didn't complete the quest where you collect the blooms. He can get a lot of swamp plants and blooms unlike my main who's finished the quest.
---
Pay to win means paid advantages. Win is not in a literal sense.
---
12 blooms means 6 plants blooming. 
---
Damn, I‚Äôm lucky if I get 3-4.
---
Yeah hopefully we'll get some info at the Game awards I think Bethesda is there.
---
Maybe we'll get some info at the Game awards as a early Christmas gift lol
---
(Post-apocalyptic) people are dicks.
---
Super lazy!! I have more stuff to do in this game. I could just craft it.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that
---
Still remember my dad telling me as a kid. Why you put it upside down? like I was an idiot. He flipped it around.
---
And I butchered my gamer tag.  As usual.  It‚Äôs ‚ÄúLL whiskey LL‚Äù with spaces.  üëéüèª
---
Doubt it lol
---
And one in the car down the road, from the main entrance..
---
Really wish this was a feature. I spent a nice hour fortifying and defending the ammo facility only to be disconnected..due to a crash. I really wish I could have gone back to all my previous work. Also I lost my caps and I'm sure I had a few hundred rounds of ammo in the box from the ammo machine
---
Even when you have the requirements to get Shielded Marine, knowing Ptotected Marine and everything prior, it is still one of the rarest plans in the game. The fact that it really only has one drop pool makes it a pain to get. I've seen Shielded plans on par in price to The Fixer plan.
---
Check the market. Be prepared to not pay caps though. Trade will probably be what is asked, assuming someone has what you want.
---
Yeah, I seem to remember something similar too... But still, getting an accurate number would be nice. Say I have a TSE shotgun, it claims a base of 80 with no perks, so does it do 80+ explosive? Including? Is it a total of 80 or 160? Is that better, in terms of damage output, than a furious mini gun with 10 base over the same period of time? 
---
 Maybe I'm just ignorant of a game mechanic or crap at maths, but when I spec up for a weapon that I calculate *should* be doing 1000+ dmg a shot and it doesn't, I'd like to be able to figure out why...
---
Thanks for the tips
---
You guys truly are what makes the Fallout community so great.
---
Yea, I was thinking of trying 2*, instead of 3 there
---
If your ever looking to sell gt BigSnacksJenkin will buy 25k caps
---
Cats with lasers.  That‚Äôs starting to sound like science fiction.  Sweet!
---
Guys, you have to patient as this is from a small indie dev with limited development experience. Oh wait. Lol, jk I love Fallout.
---
I will say a lot of their bugs do end up being a bit hilarious though.
---
If you have any weight reduction cards you need to unequip them and then re-equip them.
---
I think Queensland and Tasmania would be better targets.
---
Melee is NOT good for pvp. Not anymore.
---
I have also found that storing and replacing the hostile turrets to make them friendly again adds the hostile turrets to your build limit,which it should. However, when you place the friendly turret the old hostile weight doesn't get removed.  It's "ghost" weight never goes away.  I heard that the only way to remove it is to scrap your camp and rebuild with a new budget. Yay!
---
I always get 3 from there. The ammo bag &amp; military duck tape that's inside &amp; the ammo bag outside in the transport.
---
The reason Murgle died was you probably have the plague walker mutation. When u have a disease it creates an aura of damage around you. Ppl have accidentally killed a lot of critters with it. Spread the word, get tested, and protect your critter family.
---
Unpopular opinion: Mocking those who leave is not productive and toxic to the community. Just because the people who are frustrated with bethesda leave does not mean that its fake news or outrage.
---
People need to remember that eventually, if people get too frustrated with the game, all your left with is positive and stops being useful criticism due to small sample size.
---
Actually it's more immersive for it to be inconsistent, humans ( and devs) make mistakes lol
---
They should have made it so items in your favourites aren't even visible to anyone who trades with you.
---
I got almost the same thing yesterday, from Guided Meditation.  White powder, Whitespring, BOS jumpsuits plus both scout masks.  Kinda strange that they seem to drop as a bundle.
---
Edit: lvl 320-something.  I‚Äôve never gotten the drop before.  Still waiting on the raider shielded plan.
---
2nd Edit:  it might have been One Violent Night.  They showed up back to back and I didn‚Äôt check my loot until I went back to camp.
---
Is it the sound of the standing bass being plucked? This happens to me after leaving NW and going into Adventure.
---
Yeah! I was at some dude‚Äôs Camp earlier today, and it kept happening, it‚Äôs so weird! :)
---
Melee was nerfed beyond recognition in PvP due to the max damage cap, which made rapid-fire automatic weapons the only viable solution.
---
My advice would be to do a little of both.  Pick a class of melee and a class of gun.  Straight-up melee is extremely powerful in PvE and the most ideal means of killing the Scorchbeast Queen, but it's also tedious because you need to run up and swing at every single enemy while a gunner can just find a nice spot and headshot them all from across the parking lot.  Not to mention the latency in whether or not that melee hit actually registers.
---
My main character was basically simple, straightforward melee.  When I made the alt, her thing was stealth pistols, and she ended up being infinitely more fun to play as.
---
I blame myself.  We were trading guns and I was also putting up some caps. Put 0 price tags on my gun and he took it and ran before putting a price tag on his so I could put up the caps. It was foolish on my part but just putting out the warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
---
I'm actually looking for a shovel with 90% reduced weight so I keep it on me for burying soldiers and such. xD
---
Ok. Ive got the three tiers prior... Wow. Didnt realize it was THAT friggin hard to get. Lol. Crap. Well, guess its back to chasing down that speedy ass protectron! Lol
---
DITW??
---
Abbie‚Äôs messages? Really? The over-seers personal logs are much sadder.
---
Or wait a while.  Lightning rarely strikes twice.  It‚Äôs RNG, so odds are slim.
---
dead in the water, raid mission #1 where you drain vault 94
---
I felt for her too.
---
The stars also add a difficulty to the enemy. I have no issue with a level fifty mirelurk queen but a three star legendary queen? Oh for that I‚Äôm cheming up and check how much junk I have on me before taking her on.
---
If you can save scrip, give the purveyor a try on 1\* legendary. You might get a low level bloodied sniper rifle. That will take you to 50
---
Dude... it‚Äôs toilet paper. üòÇ
---
You sir, are a national treasure üòÇ
---
I literally just watched that video, I think it's a good expose of Bethesda's practices. After watching it I have to agree that the way they are handling the Atom Shop is kind of scummy.
---
In a time where fabric walls for houses temporarily or just.. fresh underwear or clothes since most would deteriate in 5 years or less
---
If we didnt have this we would all be wearing raider rags and sealing our bodies in metal, hell the raiders of nuka world knew this and you didnt, my advice dont be a raider
---
The hard lessons are always the most remembered
---
looks like you forgot the urban scout mask
---
I mostly agree I think but I also feel that MATN never reached the full endgame. Lots of his gear aren‚Äôt legendaries, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to know or want to acknowledge the existence of improved repair kits or the free atom shop items.
---
Are you on PC? I've got 500 sitting around since I use PA and only use it occasionally. Will sell for 4 caps each.
---
My Camp used to be there during the Prime Cut event. Unfortunately, Murgle used to die just about everyday. You get used to it lol
---
After looking at all these replies I've decided I'm not even going to install the roll, [I'm just going to put the new roll on top of the old one](https://i.imgur.com/8SnYCsu.jpg).
---
That's right, bitches. I'm a rebel.
---
That's what I do. Shhh
---
Is that event ever coming back?
---
No love for T45, huh? :)
---
I got some of the raider plans from the Savage divide treasure map 6,
---
Excavator plans are an award from completing the quest; That said I can craft those for you. Just need to supply the mats.  
---
T51 adn 60, I understand - those were a PITA to find all the parts
---
You mean the elder scrolls online target skeletons?
---
My point is that chameleon armor does not "have 0 impact" as you claimed in your post.. It helps avoid detection by NPCs at least until you start moving.
---
You compare chameleon armor on low agility character with no sneak skill to unyielding armor on high agility + Rank 3 Sneak skill characted. Such a test is obviously rigged. In order to eliminate the variables you shold compare chameleon armor to unyielding armor on the same character. And you should be at the same distance to the test NPC, at the same visibility condition (daytime/weather) and so on. It is impossivle to reproduce equal conditions on a deathclaw (unless it is sleeping). Test NPC should be not moving and facing one direction.
---
EDIT: not trying to be salty to you but your concludion was misleading. You jumped to it without logical proof. And people who read it then start to believe that "chameleon is useful for PVP only". It is not. It helps you stay invisible to NPCs until you start moving. When you do start moving that's another story, there is sound and agility and so on.
---
There a lot of cats in the wasteland and by putting the TP roll upside down they can‚Äôt unroll it. Did you see Murgles around? Definitely a cat owner. Or an idiot. Or both lol
---
Definitely worse.
---
Jon makes magnificent points, yet I am sure that this sub will downvote you, mock you and Jon (will probably call him a click bait YouTuber) and your post will be eventually deleted.
---
I already have the full T-45, X-01, and 2 sets of ultracite
---
I'm just trying to find the rest of the T-__ sets. I can craft the excavator, but If anyone had some lying around, it'd be easier on me.
---
Idk anyone who can craft them, and idk where to find the plans, lol
---
That does not change the scummy nature. 
---
In fact, he did not even touch the actual nasty bit: the Scrap Box.
---
At least no one stole your sweetroll
---
...No. 
---
First, he's level 86. That's "end game". Even if he wasn't, none of the atom shop items only affect end game players. 
---
Improved repair kits doesn't, in _any_ fucking way, excuse paid repair kits. 
---
And "free atom shop items"? Dude, "the first hit's free" is a long time running technique in any NUMBER of scummy markets, from exploitative monetization systems to drug dealers.
---
Early on you'll want to use a variety of weapons for that use all the ammo types. As for food/water, just keep moving and you will find just enough to keep you going. A lot of people may ignore the perks Dromedary (one rank only)/Good Doggy, but they are staple perks for me. 
---
Now is not a great time to build an elaborate CAMP until you've unlocked some more plans (power, water, etc), though you might set up a very small CAMP with a stash, bed, &amp; workbenches that can be easily moved. At your level, I would plop it down somewhere around Charleston since you will be spending some time there. Fast traveling is free to it and Vault 76, so that will save you time/caps. And loot everything not nailed down--you will need all of that scrap soon.
---
Not going to be able to really help you as I'm on PC but if you are looking for max level stuff are you already over 50? If so just head to watoga and server jump there for the t60 and 51b. There are 3 sets in the city and they mostly spawn those 2 types. Might take 30 minutes but you will find what you want fairly quick.
---
For the raider go to Grafton dam and server hop there. There is a set in a garage right off the road that is raider about 50 percent of the time and the green box next to it often has parts.  For the excavator just do the quest so that you can craft it yourself. Its like a 20 minute quest if not less. Not too many people are going to be interested in a set of ultracite I'm afraid, It's a free drop.
---
Post that you‚Äôre looking for someone to craft you a full set of t51b.  They‚Äôre either gonna ask for mAterials plus caps or just caps depending on the person.  You‚Äôll also need to provide an empty PA frame.

He's a click bait YouTuber..
