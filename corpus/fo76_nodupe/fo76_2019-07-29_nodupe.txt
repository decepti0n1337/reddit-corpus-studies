Not a terrible idea. Still slightly below AA, depending on your build. Same damage as 2-shot with virtually no downsides though (almost everyone runs at least 5 mutations) and 2-shot has significant downsides (accuracy and weapon degradation). Buff 2-shot back up; 40-50% damage maybe? Gives a competitor to Junkies; isn’t too far past Furious, AA is still mid tier with zero downsides.

I either heard or read somewhere that Bethesda relies on modders to fix their games for them for free. Considering that the high-res load for Fallout 4 ran so fast that NPC's were starting a sentence before finishing the first and talking all over each other, I don't have that awesome of a build by the way. A Ryzen 5 2600X with 8gb of RAM and a Radeon RX 570 4GB video card and a 1080p TV for a monitor, not a super build at all, but I am very happy with it. That being said, I am using a mod for 4K resolution and it now runs just fine. Makes my head hurt thinking about it. It still does the Bethesda crash every once in a while, but it sure is pretty doing it.
---
I also reacted like that. That's a 250 item at best.  Just wait till a sale and see if they get it.
---
I’ll be right over!
---
How would they even calculate it?  The amount of points needed to rank in SCORE increases, but we’ve been pretty stagnant with the amount of points we darn daily. How would they determine a fair amount to give? And what would be stopping people from just taking the atoms and then grinding out just XP so they could use the atoms on another shop item
---
This reminds me a lot of the original disconnect issues that consoles had when the game came out. Most of those were not related to the games code but to how the console communicated with the players WiFi router. I wonder if this is a similar issue and if using a hardwire connection would fix the issue.
---
You can't as far as I know. Paid content is as is
---
Yeah well we did this so much they actually started vaulting items without discounts.
---
The budget is literally all about visual/performance complexity. So a premade one would have the same budget because it would have the same visual complexity.
---

---
*edit* Lol at all the downvotes. Folks don't like the truth huh?
---
If you think I'm wrong, try explaining why, like TheRealUprooted did.
---
The underarmors sold in the atom shop are the casual ones: vault 51, Tactical Ops, Survivors Denim. Since its an SS underarmor, they've somehow intertwined them and it's confusing and doesn't really work for anything.
---
The skin counts as casual underarmor since it is an atom shop underarmor, but since it's for SS underarmor, it won't apply. The skin should apply to the SS underarmor, but it won't, because it's designated for casual underarmor.
---
Super dirty. But he had his back to me and was using a workbench in a PvP zone. Raiders gotta raid.
---
You could try to get in touch with support, but I doubt they'll refund for buyer's remorse.
---
That's the normal attack, heavy hits do 3301
---
A npc with a train cart on his head
---
I can give some advice. Follow along the main quest, once you get to level 20 you can do wastelanders. It's a bit confusing at first though
---
You can also repair the brahmin pen to get more targets to inject flies into if your working alone, then keep injecting the new flies too.
---
I saw that and was really interested as i'm about to complete the set. Do i have to have the camo skin for the other PA or it is simply an option in the skin section of t65?
---
The bug is when you start reloading one weapon, and right before it finishes, you switch weapons. If lag is bad and you’re lucky, the capacity of the first weapon gets applied to the mag of the second weapon(up to how much of that ammo type you have).
---
So if you have 300 50cal ball ammo, 11100 5mm Minigun, and reload a Minigun, but switch to a Dragon, and get really lucky, you’ll have 300 rounds in your Dragon. I had a 30rd Missile Launcher once (was as as many missiles as I had on me).
---
Alright thanks!
---
It's part of the game.
---
So we can expect to have it fixed in three months, gotcha
---
Bethesda probably knew it was so screwed that they had to make the season pass free instead of actually trying to be nice. They’re not gonna give free atoms because some players have been affected more than others and they’ll claim to not have the tools to accurately give them out.
---
I dont really get why the VATS gun would give me double or 2.5x the damage on 1 bullet honestly. 
---
Its as if the sneak hit doesnt properly apply with FFR in this case
---
It’s a glitched paint you get when you buy the T-65 jet pack
---
A reminder that all atom shop under armors use casual linings! Only buy it if a) you use that or b) you want to use it in Nuclear Winter!
---
Ahahah seriously?? Wow... yeah that’s pathetic. Par for the course by now, but pathetic.
---
Meh.
---
I would have to see a pic of your house to determine whether a copy cat was really a copy or just another wood shack / 5 bedroom colonial.
---
Nothing as crop take literally a ton of budget and you'll never a big enough farm that can beat specific spots on the map.
---
They can't upload it immediately because they made the horrid, horrid decision to go onto consoles. Patching consoles is EXPENSIVE so they keep it to their scheduled patch times.
---
If they would just drop that dead weight, pc could get hot fixes like any other pc mmo.
---
Yes.
---
Nyeh.
---
What I’ve found to work, at least for me, is as soon as I find a weapon I go onto my PIP-Boy, unfavorite it, and then favorite again. Then the wheel works normally.
---
Contact Bethesda Support and open up a ticket. They may do a refund, but don’t expect it to set a precedent. 
---
Also, happy cake day!!
---
I don't even think about the scrip scrap limit any more now I'm doing so many events and getting so many Legendary items. I scrap to the 150, then I sell to vendors if I have caps allowance left. And finally I just drop them where they won't be found regardless of whether it's 1* crap or 3* God.
---
All of the open fields around the bunker are where she lands. I can be standing on the fence dancing with five friends, and she will land in the field right in front of us. Don’t shoot her in the air is our number one rule.
---
What weapons are you using? And what graphical settings? It works with combat rifles at the very least, on max settings.
---
Hmh. Then you'll just have to wait for the next big update, One Wasteland
---
I run a bloodied stealth flamer so I was hoping to boost sneak critical damage lol. Oh well
---
Oof. I still need to buy the helmet and now the jetpack.That's gonna take some time,hope they don't patch it soon. 
---
Btw do i simply need to know the plan? I'd rather go emergency protocol any day of the week.
---
Definitely
---
Lol, I was just trying to confirm what you had said since I had completely forgot that was an option
---
Maybe it's him targeting Raider groups he knows has gear and tech. He used to he a Raider after all. You're theory could he true as well.
---
I posted in the PC Support forum a week or two ago about this and only just today got a reply from Bethesda telling me to submit reports on the issues (i.e. SBQ doesn't complete the 'kill huge creatures' challenge, etc).
---
I suspect as everyone else in here is saying, the response will be crickets, and I don't mean cave crickets.
---
Are you religious? You could raise a support ticket and say a few prayers. If its not faulty there's basically zero chance of a refund.
---
You have toilet paper???
---
Absolutely try this.
---
People were talking about elder and initiate brotherhood pa skins?
---
Why drop them where they won’t be found? There’s probably a lot of people who could use them even if they’re just meh weapons
---
Man I haven’t had a hard freeze yet, was hoping they didn’t happen.  I do get the occasional kicked from server message or just the sudden welcome back to your home screen crash.  Honestly, it’s probably better than what I’ve experienced with ESO but ESO is about as bad as it gets.
---
Exploiting it for what gain?  Fun?
---
It makes the craft sound but no materials get spent. I spammed it and lost no Ballistic fiber nor Flux.
---
I feel like I waste time when I build up a workshop just to have it freeze while I'm defending it.
---
I'm quite sure that "dead weight" is where they make most of their money on this game
---
Nice, I bet insult bot counts as well. I wonder if the random vendor bot counts???
---
[deleted]
---
Mad scientist?
---
Just in time with quake con 
---
I hope they announce some more stuff on that event
---
What kind of plans?
---
The BOS is basically dead atm. Once you've got access to the top floor of the asylum/Fort defiance thats it. Just tech document drops for pathetic rewards from then on. Next patch 'should' bring a new BoS questline but it's content is pure speculation atm.
---
That would not only help us get rid of unnecessary weight, but it would also relieve the servers from loading those items in out inventory or stashes,which sure takes more effort than loading a bigger number in the pipboy.
---
Nah. Justified.
---
That's great to know. I said that because of the sound of crafting. Thanks for correcting me ❤️
---
When I found out about the explosive resistance, my dreams of using homing missiles, orbital strike missiles, and mini-nukes were crushed lol
---
LOL!!! Bravo, well written post sir.
---
I sure hope not. I seem to one shot everything.
---
It's the natural product of managing perks
---
From your comments it sounds like you run Bloodied. Why are you using power armor then? Unyielding will net you 15 more strength and a ton more AP for power attacks/VATS. Do you just need the survivability of PA because you don’t go sneaky?
---
Sounds like a bunch of lies to me.
---
Its Microsoft not bethesda they keep pulling this shit
---
The guys just being an ass
---
You do get a discount- extra Atoms to spend on whatever you want!
---
It’s not literally a discount, but honestly it’s better. A discount on specific things, or a credit you can use on whatever you want- which would you prefer?
---
Saw one in the Bog recently, as well as at Scorched Earth
---
They seem to be rare
---
Bos pa paint elder and initiate from something, know anything about that?
---
Its todd
---
there used to be a couple out near tanagra town a few months ago, but...now they're just gone. 30,000 megasloths used to live here, now it's a ghost town.
---
Ditto
---
You can relax, those wolves are meant to be early game opponents and it doesn't take long before you sneeze and kill them. Its purely first come, first served and whilst it's 'polite' to share the spoils there's no rule book and anyone who tries to guilt you is an idiot.
---
I don’t think anyone serious would be farming the wolf event for gear.  Drops a level 10 1* right?   Meh lol.  When someone doesn’t allow you to tag during Project Paradise I get annoyed
---
I heard they removed the spawn at Tanagra, might've removed more instances for some odd reason
---
I am on that boat too, not lvl 100, but used all my fireworks😭.
---
[removed]
---
No you can't. Tell the person who said so to go f\*\*k himself.
---
Every time we play Nuclear Winter he gets closer to escaping his Bethesda prison!
---
You answered yourself. I only like creative placements,like into glass shelves or sunk into other objects,  or rare skins and weapons,but still ,only if they fit the camp theme with creativity. A simple gun on a wall looks stupid to me,but i'm from EU not texas looool
---
Lol. NO!
---
they advertised exclusive discounts and exclusive content etc. getting atoms as part of the subscription is not the discount advertised.
---
i am making the suggestion that the discount is given to bundles when first released.
---
Here they come with the trolls again.
---
Got what they deserved. Sadly the game is dragged down by a cesspool of idiots who think pvp and griefing is one and the same.
---
Wtf how many atoms do you need btw
---
Does she not have pacifist mode on?
---
It wasn't Cracker Barrel, it was Chili's.    
---
I was there.  
---
So were the Cleveland Browns.
---
I’d go with the Z5033 personally if you’re built for crits, but I like ammo efficiency too. Bigger crits when you’re hitting a crit every other shot (bloodied crit build) adds up real fast. And doing more damage per hit is always nice (even if overall DPS is slightly lower), if you use 25% less ammo.
---
Unfortunately probably not. However these compliment the fasnacht balloons at my firing range camp quite nicely.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Nope still there. My camp is next to megasloth spawn spot and i get to kill 2 of them every 3rd login or so.
---
3rd one down, its in with the vaultect overstuffed chair.
---
It's under chairs - if you have the Vault-Tec Overstuffed Chair, it's a variant on that.
---
My fix is reload, but then sometimes you get the reload bug where you empty the clip if you don't switch weapons, Bugthesda
---
Isn’t it the worst though when you’ve built it all up have a solid defense and then you go off questing and then right before you go back to collect the game says nah you don’t need those resources.  That’s like okay bye game cya tomorrow.
---
hey. I'm back. the day I hop on back from vacation I get a message from little guy "hay, need junk" "lots. of. junk." unbelievable
---
I know, everyone wants to argue. I just know when I looked at it, and how it was placed, I thought "son of a bitch!", then I thought "well I guess he liked it!". I will say it features multiple buildings, a 'commercial" feel and you are greeted by a raider hangin tree (very similar to my imitator). It is a masterpiece (to my mind anyway). You will know it's me when you see a cafe called "EAT", and if you do don't forget to look for secret rooms. My (seperate account) Alt just built the "Fauci V.A. Clinic" within view of it. THAT place features an ER, an OR, a Morgue with a crematorium, a COVID ward and small parkette with a very dangerous child's slide. You may find the siren annoying. Unless I am server hopping you will see them together.
---
I am considering placing a "titty twister" dusk-to-dawn homage and/or a "Space Force Launch Pad" (the rocket will have to be square) there with other alts. That's about 6-8 hours of total absorption right there.
---
I know I am being cagey, but I don't want too many people building on the spot cuz I want to be able to place my camp easily.
---
Well... I've been on but I'm not sure where the people I was supposed to be meeting are... I haven't heard anything from them...
---
They can’t. Budget is about server AND CLIENT performance. You may be able to build and render and 400 room mansion on your custom built PC, but this is an online game. Poor joe with his minimum spec computer would crash or run at 1fps every time he came near your camp.
---
You can actually favorite your apparel in the vault right before the match to the same effect!
---
Do you need base SS armor to use it or can you just craft it at a bench?
---
Shoot on sight. Funny once, annoying twice, lead and steel supply the third time.
---
I don’t have that chair, but I looked through every chair/couch/bench and looked through every variant. I know what vault tech chair you are talking about though, the single seat blue one. Unfortunately it doesn’t have any variants for me. I’ll check again later to see if maybe it’s just another stupid bug.
---
That’s funny. I think if I took off every damage perk and hit one of those big bad alphas with one bare handed shot it would still be dead!
---
PC?
---
Would that prevent the camp destruction?
---
I'm on console and haven't ever toyed with my graphics settings, are there even graphics settings on console? Idk, I'll look into that. I was using a minigun.
---
Xbox srry
---
Sounds cool
---
i see what you did there
---
Yeah, you're right. I'm actually terrible with stealth so I run power armor. I've been trying to roll Unyielding at the Purveyor with little luck. Hopefully when Legendary perks come out there is something to help, but I am SO BAD at speccing any character's I have.
---
That laser is outstanding. Well done.
---
Yes
---
Mine doesn’t say it has a variant, I saw some other posts of people asking where it was and people said the same thing about the blue vault tech chair, some people said miscellaneous. I wish someone could send me a picture of it if they own it lol. Thank you though, I’m gonna check again later to see if it’ll be there.
---
NYET!!!
---
Appreciate it I’ll have her enable it.
---
I believe you. What do you usually use?
---
You can get a refund. I just got a refund today for a purchase I made two months ago (I submitted the ticket today bc I just learned that refunds are possible). So yeah, submit a ticket, check for their response, it will probably only take a couple hours.
---
There’s three different “types” of criticals- 
---
Hitting an enemy’s weak point (but Bethesda has been SUPER LAZY about modeling this and it isn’t always accurate, ESPECIALLY on the new FO76 enemies) like headshots on humanoids gives you the yellow numbers, but that’s not really a crit, it’s just (potentially) bonus damage for hitting their weak point.
---
Sneak attacks. They aren’t really a critical. Just a sneak attack.
---
And the actual true critical- VATS triggered criticals (the crit bar fill-up and then manually trigger mechanics).
---
You wanna talk about PVP? Enjoy your BAN
---
I just use it to complete the legendary enemy daily/weekly.
---
Lol yes this game has alot of bugs. Hopefully its fixed soon because it gives other players the advantage since it makes the player movement slower too btw good fine. That sounds like a quicker fix btw do you switch weapons first than reload to prevent the reload bug?
---
I often server hop Bog and Mire locations when my pets die, and Mega Sloth is one I often farm. I’ve seen and tamed them in both regions over the past two weeks. Not sure if they’ve disappeared from dedicated spawn locations like Tanagra or Treetops but they definitely still appear in those random encounter areas. Randomly and rarely, as always.
---
If your on ps4 i would love to join you revengers  on any of tour journeys im sick of nice  people just letting it go 8m lev 130 and can hunt any han down
---
Lol, dead weight. More than half of their revenue you mean?
---
You need to buy the plans with gold bullion to craft SS armor, and then you can apply the skin to it
---
Congratulations, you just got a bigger punishment than most dupers
---
 The PvE in Adventure Mode has gotten so stale :(  At least Survival Mode provided a pseudo-end-game option for those who wanted it.
---
 I miss roaming the harsher map, it was so much more exciting. I miss searching for player-corpse markers on the map to hunt for junk/meds. I miss the PvP bouts at West-tec where the winner got to farm the super mutants. I miss the Weekly Challenges to get Legendary Weapons.
---
I miss Survival Mode so much
---
Shut up Paul!
---
I once yelled at one of those wolves and dropped a you have been insulted note. The thing just fell over dead. Still haven’t been banned......
---
There's a decoded message from weeks ago that does little more than confirm Atlas Observatory as their future base. That's it. Could be a few quick missions or an extended questline, no one knows yet. Whatever it is people will heap praise on day 1, race to complete, and complain for ever more after...usual routine.
---
I'll kill anyone he wants as long as I keep getting those sweet notes
---
Everyone should be using Blocker. Bullet Shield isn’t even on the RADAR!
---
I haven’t even finished the original storyline.  I just just play around and do quests as they come my way.  I’ve enjoyed the computer Allies that will set up in your camp and provide quests.  
---
There is enough to keep me interested.  I am not hardcore or trying to get everything maxed out, just enjoy playing the game.
---
Yes the starter island in fortnite is the same cell. In fact I believe you can see the island off in the distance.
---
Same with even Apex Legends - they actually show you the loaded map as everyone else loads in
---
The mine/reload will be patched before adrenaline.
---
Blocker.
---
Switching perspectives/weapons is usually only fix.  It's been a bug for a while, not sure what causes it.  But I've been killed as a result of it quite a few times.
---
I’d call that work...
---
In my own way,  I AM king.
---
You can only have one at a time.
---
Is Blocker that much better? Is it because most enemies do melee? and 45% is huge?
---
I half-think they just keep the Dead Rising-tier jokey outfit stuff for YouTuber gags. All it really does is make things like the Mistress of Mysteries gear even less appealing for half the characters.
---
I'm on my phone or I'd post a pic for you, but I promise it is there.
---
So I’d have to store one to use the other
---
I've played the mode since it launched and am around level 200 in NW.  The load in problem was never this bad pre-wastelanders, or at the very least, it wasn't impacting as many people as it is now.
---
You get 4 notes, plans, repair kits, 4 flux, event XP, a 2nd event legendary item and other stuff from her.  That is her loot.
---
If you're asking for all these 3 star legendaries that I can 1 shot should drop 3 star items, that is stupid.  I'm already swimming in 3 star legendary items I can't get rid of fast enough.  Get good.
---
You can just switch between what they collect. Choose your favourite. Make him collect any type of stuff the others collect.
---
Yeah I believe you, someone sent me a pic of exactly where it was, hopefully it’ll be there later when I log on.
---
It is. Whether you mix it up as a melee character guaranteeing retaliatory melee, or play a stealthy sniper that gets caught by a mob of feral ghouls, Blocker gives you serious bang for the buck.
---
Maybe a vats bug. I know if you miss a critical due to enemies walking behind cover you get it back.
---
Definitely cool. I'd do it irl if I didn't live on a boat.
---
Only 1, a shame as I have 5 options. Rather than a new bot its just a new menu option, paint job and annoying dialogue you get sick of very quickly. They couldn't even be bothered to give them truly unique skins.
---
As someone else said, Dr Zorbo advances 1 place a day, and the season is over when he reaches the end. He is your pace marker.
---
Understand that he started the game like 20 spaces ahead of you, though.
---
Damn I was hoping I could use some of the atoms I've had to circumvent the grind,oh well.
---
It's an issue with Wastelanders.  Same exact hardware, I used to load in at around the same time as everyone else pre-wastelanders.  Post-wastelanders, sometimes I don't spawn in until 30+ seconds later and people are already playing in the match.  Something with the update changed something with the way NW loads.
---
Imagine having to jump through as many hoops as you do on this game to have double sided wallpaper... fucking hell Bethesda.
---
Armor plans, weapon plans, weapon mod plans, mount plans and other decor plans.
---
got some resolution, after essentially going without any notice for a week besides automated responese i kept making posts on bethesda supports twitter, last one said im getting my bank to refund me the money for services not rendered, lo and behold in 20mins i get a response from the ticket.
---
wonderful customer service... when you can get it, they even gave me some atoms for my troubles. heres a excerpt of the ticket...
---
" I've investigated this for you, and it appears that the  membership did not properly activate as you purchased the annual  membership before the existing monthly membership expired. In this  situation, the billing for the membership can create a bug where it  attempts to start a new membership before the existing membership  expires, causing the fulfillment to fail.
---
While I cannot manually activate the annual membership for  you, I have processed a refund for it. Please allow 5-10 business days  for the funds to be returned.
---
If you'd like to attempt purchasing a membership again, I  would recommend the monthly option to err on the safe side, as the  annual membership bug could possibly re-occur."
---
so it seems to avoid this happening if youre like me and used a monthly membership as a bit of a trial, cancelling the automatic renewal then purchasing a yearly one prior to the expiry date, it may be prudent to cancel your automatic renewal and let the fallout first membership expire, then buy the yearly one on a new date.
---
speaking to the bethesda support rep ill be purchasing a new yearly membership soon and if it does bug out again theyve mentioned it wont be a issue to give me a refund. spose the issue will be getting a response first haha
---
You can do criticals with melee. It just takes longer.
---
The easiest way to be this challenge is using a shotgun. On a critical all pellets count so it takes just a couple minutes to do. Any old shotgun works too!
---
3* means potential for 3*. Not actual 3*. It's not a bug. It's a feature.
---
A highly fucking annoying feature when you get a 1* piece of shit. 
---
But, honesty, I enjoy a challenge and getting any 3* out of them, let alone a good 3* is a thrill. A thrill that would be gone if they were guaranteed.
---
People play differently. I don't really want different servers for different game play, because, I'm a fan of full worlds.
---
But, it would be awesome if you could choose your gameplay - Easy, hard, fucking brutal, and be tagged as such in the game.
---
And then, not allow sales or drops of difficulty level items between levels.
---
And that sounds like a programming challenge that would take massive resources and time, even if they thought of it from the get go. Trying to implement it now? Lol....you do want this shit to be somewhat stable right?
---
And so we get the compromise.
---
"The game needs cash to stay alive" is a worthless statement. I need cash to stay alive. Every company has costs. That in no way undermines criticisms of how much they ask and how much they give in return. It also doesn't mean Bethesda is justified in monetizing the crap out of 76, which is clearly not getting triple-A treatment while the game maintains triple-A pricing. 
---
Again, you can't boil down criticisms of the greed going on to 'games need money'. It's an oversimplification and a moot point unless you can lay out exactly what the costs are and show players that X amount of money is indeed needed.
---
Also, many games are free to play with optional cash shop. Take a look at Path of Exile and explain to me how a smaller studio produces a very popular online game with minimal monetization that does not interfere with gameplay or deprive players of earnables in-game, while you simultaenously try to justify Bethesda's moves with 76.
---
What you're doing is excusing greed, the kind that turns good games into bad games and good studios into bad studios.
---
That’s not entirely true. The budget suck comes from variability as well. You can put endless combinations of bobble heads in the stand. So that’s the real add of complexity
---
Same.  I mean it’s courteous to allow someone to tag.  For a low level enemy, it’s difficult without switching to a pistol or low damage gun.  
---
To answer your question, no you don’t get banned.  Idk why they are so agro about it.  Most events have legendaries.
---
I don't think so but many abities restore critical bar and such.
---
Just do a search for vats build and you will find some good stuff.
---
Wow cool! I can't get on rn but it's great that your doing this!
---
Vats bug for sure, super annoying
---
You know what? Now I'm going to equip it even harder.
---
https://youtu.be/EMSrjJngnkY
---
This is a good addition, hadn't thought of that! Thanks! I think 3 tops would be easiest to manage if you were to gun fu.
---
Only available for meme prices.
---
The bug bit me today for the 1st time as well. 2 of the weeklies auto-completed. (Huge creatures and 5 CAMP set ups). I am reading a lot of folks got hit today for the first time and it was in the weeklies.
---
Of course I love to give to the community, it is what the holy.mothman would want us to do. But also just love seeing smiles on peoples faces and the heart emoji. Have a blessed day brother and when you are on feel free to drop on by, lately not many people coming to my giveaways.
---
I am, yes.
---
It's annoying you can't select a default stimpak to use. It's plain stupid you also can't favourite. I sell all but the standards as otherwise they sit unused even if they are better options for the build/play style.
---
To get a quicker help put up on the looking for group "encrypted on me" and high levels will flock to join
---
"Fallout 76 is not in the same situation as WoW, and never will be. Not even close by a long shot."
---
And yet Fallout 76 is more monetized than WoW. An inferior game, much less popular, asking the playerbase to pay more money so they can get slow, hit and miss development and a near blackout on non-monetized new items, and a lot of broken or unfulfilled promises.
---
Yes, they are pretty nice
---
You have to do the quest of turning in technical data
---
Nice! Sadly I only play from noon-2pm EST but alot of players are on late at night 😢
---
Any update as to when they will rerelease the cabinet display thing from thanksgiving, or the super mutant emote, or the holiday pack from the first xmas (the one with xmas emotes and a wearable Santa Claus beard)?
---
Where do you get that quest?
---
I wonder if you have to have the vault-tec chair unlocked...surely Bethesda wouldn’t do that...take people’s atoms for cosmetics they can’t use...I hope it’s there for you
---
Isn’t the default paint kinda sorta clandestine anyway?
---
Months. Fucking months of braindead grind.
---
Yes, I answer you in another reply.
---
I go with elder paint and paladin in arms because I love the simbol (winged sword)
---
Happy wife happy life 🤣

All that would do would make the daily scrip limit 200 really after a certain point. As you would just be spending your 200 scrip and the bouncing back to the limit each day. 
---
Surely raising the daily scrip to say 500 would be far better.
---
Ya, I gave up on the gauss weapons because of it. The trusty handmade works just fine!!
---
Yeah I usually have that time as well but ended up getting on in the evening. Probably wont be my last give away though add me so you can come to my next one mate.
---
He stole your bass from your base?
---
I hope he didn’t get your fish, too.
---
Atm I’ve got mine collecting ammo, I’m only a level 10 though so I need to be looking for better guns
---
Lol believe it or not in one of the patch notes months ago they said this event was fixed ...yea right
---
I don’t know the schedule but they most certainly didn’t pay someone to create any of these things to only sell them once.
---
Nice find. I'll try the weapon swap next time btw how long has this bug been occurring for you? Also what type of xbox do you have?
---
Worked 100% for me, and I wish it showed more often as they are the easiest SB kills anywhere.
---
Head is shaken
---
Blocker. It’s definitely my go to, especially since DR/ER has diminishing returns after about 450, IIRC.
---
Also, Happy Cake Day!
---
There is no argument here. It is unintentional and doing it purposefully is against the text of the rules being enforced. Those roles being stupid and Bethesda not patching their game effectively are different discussions that are irrelevant to this central point.
---
Yeah it's broken, sometimes scorched are spawned but never scorchbeast.
---
What level are you?
---
I think it activates when you get a tecnical data, but no; it is a somepoint in the main questline. When you go to their fort I think. Fort defiance I think.
---
Btw super advice; turn in the tecnical data 1 by 1. I mean get one, complete the quest; get another, complete the quest again. And thats it :)
---
This is like the videogame equivalent of fining someone for picking up a penny from the ground...
---
Now they’re going to fix it. Congratu fucking lations. You know they fix all the bugs we don’t want fixed!
---
Blocker gives you a solid 45% dmg resist (melee) while 60 DR is not that much.
---
Did they get locked out too?
---
What I do is fast travel away and then come back and a SB will be there.  
---
This works in mire, where I hop to Harpers ferry.  Ash heap and bog tend to work fine.
---
Like any Bethesda game, you have to work around the bugs!
---
Huge creatures and C.A.M.P. challenges as well, huh?
---
I honestly thought the bug occurred because I went straight to NW instead of going into Adventure when I started playing. My brother and a friend didn't have the bug, so that's what made me theorize that was the reason why, since I've heard last year it happened to daily challenges if you went played NW before Adventure.
---
The only thing that number tells you is that the person is either a hacker/duper/glitchier or all these.
---
The cinder blocks would be nice if I could apply it to both sides of a wall.
---
Hey, they sold a skin for the alien blaster for $5 too. A skin for a weapon that not only sucks even in the forest, but is also severely bugged
---
Maybe I should try to contact them. I guess they won’t know certain items are in demand if we don’t communicate (or try to at least).
---
Sometimes. It helps if you scout around a little before throwing the switch. If I see him off in the distance I’ll take a shot at him so he moves in closer, then throw the switch to start the event. It’s definitely buggy.
---
Yes you can, just do it.
---
I mean its not gonna be easy but a lot of time left still. And you can buy the final levels with atoms
---
96.  I've been to fort defiance
---
Gives you and those around you a random boost iirc. I always open one in the middle of a SBQ fight.
---
Oh gawd,dont tell me theres another dupe method going on? ....
---
I've been hoping for 'Factions' for nearly 2 years now... I really HOPE Bethesda eventually does something like how it is in ESO. Player created 'Factions' would be amazing.
---
Do you also advocate arresting people for picking up pennies from the ground?
---
Because that’s someone else’s penny that they dropped on the ground and you just stole it, so it’s a crime!!!
---
Def not a joke, I’ve been playing since launch day and I’m still a vats noob. So when you do a crit hit, is it guaranteed to hit no matter what the chance number says? Also if you don’t use it, will it build up the hit power and hit harder when you use it?
---
Xbox has a great “Looking For Group” feature. Try it with FO76, there are always posts from other players looking to team up for any number of reasons.
---
My father was a coal yard guard back in the early 90s in WV, he did say it could be a dangerous job but he never went into depth about it. I wonder if some of situation going on even then out in the mountains where we lived. I know jobs didn't pay well out there and they didn't worry about firing someone at the drop of a hat. Eventually he got a job as a conductor for the railroad and made decent pay from it, but I remember him bouncing between security jobs and construction odd jobs in my early childhood. Sat on many rooftops while he shingled them, he would carry me up the ladder like a bundle of shingles. Lol
---
This.
---
Double SCORE is useless without a ton more challenges to do!
---
Oh yeah thanks I completely forgot
---
That's not an appropriate analogy and doesn't actually fit this situation. Check one of my comments later in the thing. Bethesda actually says "don't do this" so posting about it on Bethesdas own forums is against the rules and one of the dumbest things to do. It's obviously unintended.
---
Yeah, nothing worse than the feeling of wasted time.
---
It’s a glitch. Not a supported feature.
---
Damn i like how you did it with a vendor setup!!
---
?  I have a guass minigun, love it to pieces.
---
How about once they fix some of their major F*ck up that’s when we will “stop abusing exploits”
---
They’re emotional terrorists shame on them
---
Not that I know of there is probably one just not popular
---
I got an old TSE. I love any excuse to pull that out
---
that shit made me so happy too, kitchen is finally finished.
---
I don’t really notice it but now that I’m paying attention sometimes enemies get a green highlight. I wonder if that’s from player walker. Not too significant and i think it prolongs your diseases.
---
Yeah mate I believe it does, but for me it was more space than budget. I've got a tiny CAMP with a low 'footprint' but 1/3 of budget used.
---
I agree a bigger more elaborate base should use a fusion.
---
It’s an exploit. Not sure if it’s a bannable offense but you can check YouTube to see how it’s done.  Involves blueprinting at the Converted Munitions Factory.
---
There is no legitimate way to do this. It involves an exploit/glitch, and this subreddit doesn’t allow detailed discussions of those.
---
I as well went to NW right went I logged in. I got the NW daily there to get it out of the way and when I went to Adventure for the first time and noticed the bug ate those 2 weeklies. I will always be logging into Adventure first from now on....(as well as standing on 1 foot ....while facing East....wearing my Tigers hat on backwards ...hoping the bug doesn’t bite me again).....
---
Oh i see and your responses were much appreciated. I'll look more into it while creating a new character today because vats looks like it has a high damage output with the right perks after reading all these responses and testing it a few minutes ago
---
Where I live I don't get enemy spawns and you'll never stop a committed player from smashing your stuff so I went without turrets. It works for me :)
---
That’s exactly the right analogy.
---
Bethesda dropped the penny on the ground due it’s own clumsiness and now it’s going around punishing people for picking up the said penny.
---
What Bethesda does not understand in this situation is that nobody sane would consider this stealing and it is not the finders fault that Bethesda dropped the penny...
---
I also think we should have a repeatable daily for leveling up. And perhaps have a multiplier that bases the score received on the level achieved?
---
Overall, I like the season concept. I like most of the rewards (especially the Sheepsquatch plushie!). There's definitely room for improvement when it comes to earning score. I don't like that it is completely tied to daily and weekly challenges. I would like to see other ways to earn score. Daily quests seem like an obvious one. Community events are another. Let's hope they take the legitimate criticisms to heart, and use that feedback to improve seasons in the future.
---
And for the love of god, raise the scrip limit if you're going to offer scrip as a seasonal reward!
---
I still have my first awesome legendary in my stash, an instigating gauss rifle. I wanted to display it but it looks odd on the rack so it just sits, unseen, in my stash.
---

---
The game automatically adds players to your game when you join, and you can join a public group and follow teammates (or just the leader) around as well. Not everyone uses mics though. If you do, LFG is probably a better way to start.
---
Lunchboxes are awesome I pip every one at SBQ, RR etc in the middle of player packs. They've got some cool boosts!
---
Yes, if I remember to reload, lol. Don't always get the reload thing, though it seems to love to happen when you're in the final combatants, in a small circle, like yelling "I am over here!!!!!"
---
Basically just ignore this event.  I've tried it 3 times after a year of playing.  It never lets me turn the damn thing on.  I can click on the switch until I get bored though which is fun I guess.
---
It gets boring after a while, but it's about 1 fly every 5 seconds. There are other factors to consider as well such as the direction the turret is pointing when the fly spawns and if you can hit it quick enough. Sometimes the turret can kill it before you get a chance to tag it then you have to start over. When I use gun fu, the delay to acquire next target is usually just enough to target the next spawning fly and keep me in vats. It takes a little practice but it is an easy way to get acid without leaving your camp.
---
Hi, it's me again! I'd be happy to help out
---
I was confused until I saw console cause I add them to favorite wheel which seems to be better for pc.
---
Only if you are an unarmed build, I love my furious  gauntlet, it mashes everything and everyone.
---
Wow I didn't know it affected connectivity in public however I'm not surprised!
---
Hey! What's Ur gt? Idm if u DM it
---
Thanks!
---
They spawn they just get stuck elsewhere and you never see them. At the location below watoga it gets stuck in the train yard mostly. If you go find it and kill it (you can’t see it from inside the area at all) it doesn’t count, but half the time it doesn’t even make it that far. 
---
The one in the mire is the same. Sometimes spawns right at the bottom of the cliff in the water. Rest of time nothing. 
---
Only one that has worked 100 percent for me is the ash heap one. Dead easy and worth it but the rest aren’t worth the effort. 
---
Shambles of an event really, needs fixing or at least disabling so actual events can spawn more in its place.
---
Never had a problem with it myself
---
I wanna see some big sales on the atomic shop
---
I don’t believe so, I believe the “magic” effect on the minis is just the fire rate... I believe shotguns with bashing or limb damage provide “magic” results... I get my results on my shotgunner from the armor effect. I’m not 100% on the mini guns “magic” effects tho
---
I meant the pistol and shotgun and I suppose the rifle. For whatever reason the charging mechanic just makes Vats go to shit.
---
I'm sure the mini is amazing.  Looks epic at SBQ fights!! 👍👍
---
Oh, I have no idea then. 
---
On a related note, is your minigun explosive? I’ve heard that that could make it so there’s no decals left over.
---
Yes. You don’t need to craft the jetpack
---
They literally posted about an exploit which is against the forums rules regardless of the fact that Bethesda is responsible for the exploit. If they wanted to report it they should have submitted a bug ticket on the support site where you are supposed to do that.
---
Picking up a penny on the ground is not stealing btw which is why your analogy is so wrong.
---
When all I have is stim supers in my inventory they work just fine on the hot key. Just drop the diluteds and give the regular stone to low levels. That’s what I do anyway
---
Bank error in your favor. At least you aren't missing Score like some of us.
---
Most of the time it's stuck somewhere. One works first time for me always. The one in northern bog. The others i have to run around looking for it. I will try the fast travel thing next time.
---
Ya with an auto rifle set up correctly you can just hold the critical button and melt things!
---
If using unintended mechanics is against the rules then we're all guilty, because it isn't possible to play the game without doing so.
---
They normally do huge sale off eso’s crowns 
---
like 50% huge
---
It be cool if they do the same on atoms
---
Ya def know that, forgot about it as I never play on teams or in public servers, public servers is like playing Fallout 76 Beta all over again.
---
I love the minimalist approach to CAMPS too. I have a nuke decontamination area which is a chem bench and a shower set up like a compact lab. I only need to be refine flux and scrap with it. And totally agree that the kits make the weapon and armor benches irrelevant!
---
Yes. The majority of attacks to you are melee.
---
I never received the score. It just shows them being completed so I can’t attempt them.
---
Thank bud I'll check it out!
---
I suppose they won’t cell vault 51 bc of the possibility to glitch into it
---
I’ve been noticing a lot of CTDs recently when just trying to fast travel. I’d take the bug where you just don’t travel over this...
---
In that case, welcome to our world.
---
Nicely done. Great finding!
---
Yes and stealing is also against the law, yet I wouldn’t imagine that the police would be very bothered about someone picking up the penny.
---
Oh I don't doubt it'll blow the budget up but my issue was size (lol... That's what SHE said) so the budget didnt matter when I could hide the lot and have no noise.
---
Yes it is, but ONLY with the accelerated barrel since it will put the fire rate over 200.
---
Okay, awesome.
---
Turrets also count, at least the wall mounted ones
---
I know that it says that things will come off of the wall but everytime I apply new wallpapers everything stays up?
---
Lol thats so true and being a final combatant might be whats causing it. Its been happening during that time too now that i think of it btw how long has this bug been occurring for you? Also what type of xbox do you play fallout 76 on?
---
Killed 3 of them today SE of mumbles old shack over the dam.
---
They still need the random magic effects as well as having a fast fire rate for heavy guns.
---
Have any diseases or addictions?
---
No. Just like I can’t be reported for shooting someone who was lurking Feed the People and not contributing. (They killed me, of course, but I did feel better.)
---
RIP Fido!!!!
---
Yeah I was wondering if it still happened to anyone else after patch 20- which they said was addressed and fixed.
---
Congratulations! Protip: you can wallpaper that window wall if you highlight it, replace it with the solid or doorway variant, apply the wallpaper, then replace it back to the window variant.
---
Picking up a penny off the ground isn't stealing at all. That's why your analogy fails so badly
---
...and it'd be nice if you could actually use the armor versions in NW.  But I guess that's a balance issue?  I dunno, still disappointing.
---
It’s super buggy so if u do it don’t be surprised if ur camp bugs out

I believe that it's now been tested that as long as you had a solid amount of frames per second constantly around at least 60 you can actually achieve the heavy guns magic effect with lower fire rates or around 150+.

---
PS4, the reload bug has been in NW since the start if I remember correctly. The aim down sight thing started in adventure for me last winter sometime, only last few months has it happened to me in NW.
---
Congratulations!!!
---
It is stealing, much like picking up someone’s dropped wallet and deciding to keep the contents to yourself is stealing. But unlike the wallet, nobody gives a single flying duck about the penny, which is why Bethesda treating this “penny” as an exploit is absurd.
---
Im sure glad i bought that Raider collectron early this morning before the reset, Because todays items in atom store are shit!😂
---
Yeah, just found a VBash minigun :D
---
Bethesda is the authority and they can do what they want with enforcing their rules. That's all there is to it
---
Imagine if we just had access to everything, and it was simply DISCOUNTS, not sales each week. 
---
Bethesda pls...
---
What a joke. Project lead needs to take responsibility for constantly losing sight of small but highly disappointing things like this. 
---
Month 3 and we are yet to see deep pocketed SS limbs mod, too.
---
This should literally be a paint skin for the SS under armor that cost gold, and it should take the SS linings that cost gold. 
---
how to submit a request for my money back ??
---
Yeah.  I really liked the gauss rifle in 4, still pretty good w/o vats in 76.
---
First time I actually spent atoms in a month or two.
---
Do you have an armor effect like Auto-Stim?  Do you have ‘Born Survivor’ equipped or on a team with someone that is sharing that perk?
---
Do you have a piece if armour that auto uses stimpacks when you get to low health or a perk equipt that is doing this?
---
Your scenario potentially crashes or corrupts the entire in game economy, which has basically already happened. 
---
Mine is a doodad. Makes the gun reload fast a couple of times... Probably resets when you log out or something.... you get maybe 5 or 10 doodads then they're gone. 
---
Yep. Those are the same... My very very bad exploit, I thought was fun, for maybe 5 seconds...
---
The effect of the fireworks mine, is so underwhelming that a fast gun reload effect may have been the intent for all I know. I'm barely paying attention. Why the hell would I...
---
Willfully missing the point does not make you correct nor does making a generalized argument that the game is so buggy that we are all exploiters. Its obvious that is incorrect, and that the bug/exploit is not the problem. Spreading the word on the official forums was which is why your man was warned. Why are you so heavily invested in a man-baby feeling wronged?
---
Oh I know. But it keeps changing back so I got tired of changing it. Haha. Looks rustic lol
---
They didn’t put PA skins in the shop?
---
Yes I do thank you for the help
---
That looks bangin
---
Check your armor for the life saving legendary effect. If you are a bloodied build don't use auto-stim. For power armor. don't use medic pump. If you are below 20% health it will use a stim pack.
---
I'll bet the actual difference in model "load" between bobbleheads isn't enough to be significant. So the end result of a fully stocked stand is still going to have the same "load" regardless if it's premade or not. The exception here would be if Bethesda was "rounding" the load value up or down on bobbleheads, where a premade stand would use a collective aggregate value instead of 15 individual values. Unknown if that would work in our favor or not though; maybe their load value is being rounded down, to our benefit? Maybe it's being rounded up, to our detriment? 
---
Active scripts add to "load", sure. But the stand doesn't use active scripts, just reactive ones when you interact with it. Active scripts are for things like resources (food, water, etc), brahmin (resource AND "ai"), and turrets (AI). The stand has no scripts running when it's just sitting there, so that's not something that will impact it's budget.
---
That’s why I always mention I’m not 100% sure if I don’t know the weapon
---
Probably one of your armor pieces has the auto-stim under % health effect.
---
Are they both exploits?
---
Yes, which is why this post exists and which is why Bethesda treating this as an exploit is absurd. Freaking flying nuclear winter hackers roam free despite people sending actual video evidence to Bethesda.
---
There's been a fire watchtower prefab in the files for a few months now, but there's no Atomic Shop preview images for it yet so it's probably not coming any time soon. I really don't understand why there are so many unreleased AS items in the files but they'd rather keep rereleasing old content, and I say that even as someone waiting for specific items to be available again.
---
Legendary should just be legendary, no stars. An item can go up to 3*. Just like crafting buillon gear
---
Whats this about now ?
---
Brilliant!
---
Absolutely
---
Who ever said they’d report you for ONE SHOTIng a level 10 is stupid
---
Yah your right jet isn’t even in the game
---
Slightly yeh, but jet did exsist in some form before the great war as well.
---
You get it when rose ask you to craft it in her quest....
---
I believe it's possible to get them through a good bug right now, you'll need 16k exp in NW
---
It's literally an exploit. Using an unintended mechanic for an advantage or abusing what is considered a bug and what can easily be avoided by just not equipping it or using it so it's no longer equipped. Bethesda labels this an exploit just like the unyielding bug that allows you to double your unyielding bonus. No matter what you think that is what it is and the punishment was justified
---
They did cell vault 51. The reason it’s not the same cell as the map is that the map is too big. It’s not a specially made map it’s still as large as the normal map just sectioned off.
---
You’re right because I remember in fo4 you could find jet in safes in sanctuary hills. Then again I do know spawn rates and spawn locations sometimes don’t effect lore

Am I missing something? Yes you can make more damage with other consumables like bobble head etc.

I think there's a damage cap (4200) that your weapon can have- but not the damage it can inflict on an enemy.
---
I believe I could inflict 50,000 if I used bobblehead, magazine &amp; +1 STR uny &amp; weapon.
---
Oh wow thats sounds even better because the rifleman build that i tested it on had used the entire crit meter. Thanks for the tip.
---
That sucks man but I don’t think I could help
---
Nice plan, mmm workshops are the last PvP is left so I think inevitably some people is going to go to kill you. Its a hard thing, I dont know what you can do; your base would be the best choice but also you can save your constructions in schematics and rebuild them easily.
---
Anyway, I think people is going to be good and nice with you in general. :)
---
I agree. I think they should up the daily limit on that and scrip, plus raise the max amount you can hold for all 3 currencies. Scrip is easy-- match the daily limit to the daily stock of legendary modules, if you're going to have a daily limit at all.
---
Lazy writing just like most of the game. Just so they can use things from previous games. Cheaper that way.
---
Nope just a regular ol' minigun
---
have an opinion? BAITING AND TROLLING
---
Thanks a bunch! :)
---
EXACTLY!
---
No
---
Thanks so much!
---
I second this
---
Jet is one of the most common and most used chems in fo4.
---
As a lore nerd, i hate lazy writing. I love the little sayings you get throughout the story
---
Again, picking up a penny from the ground is considered stealing according to the law.
---
But nobody sane actually treats picking up a penny or even couple of dollars stealing.
---
Bethesda is punishing people for picking up the penny, instead of trying to prevent dropping pennies on the ground in the future.
---
I can personally attest to one of these points being wrong. Using a regular minigun shooting my posters does not leave a mark.
---
Aren't eating or drinking bugged currently somehow? Like Herbivore is? You get extra xp or something? With the most broad and stupid definition of "exploit", then using herbivore and then consuming anything, is an exploit because you get extra benefit for it...You cannot not eat/drink in the game or else you die...
---
Have u seen why the community posts sometimes. If when people post about a bug people would comment help things instead of f Beth we might get somewhere
---
All mine too. No, they won't compensate you. At least I have the week for other games I guess.
---
Yes Afus helped me thank you for the help anyway!
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Yep ur right
---
those damm things are ridiculously  overpowered at the higher levels 
---
try hitting the ones at the shacks near white springs station  with artillery  and 50cal 
---
its a dammed gas bag not a tank
---
Not looking forward to the upcoming couch and rug. Your month subscription gets you......a rug. Come back next month for more!
---
I’ve noticed this too, I farm the mire practically every day and sloths just aren’t spawning in their usual spots. Interestingly, I saw one spawn just south of Dabney Homestead. Dropped out of tree during and defend event. I usually don’t cross that area so I may have just missed it before.
---
Atom shop

Did you ever think that the people who run the forum are not the developers? Maybe they can do things at the same time? You keep using an analogy that doesn't actually work. https://www.quora.com/Can-a-person-be-arrested-for-picking-up-a-penny-nickel-quarter-dollar-After-all-it-does-belong-to-someone-so-wouldnt-this-be-considered-theft#:~:text=coins%2C%20you%20ca-,Given%20that%20since%201982%2C%20the%20American%20penny%20coin%20is%20composed,pennies%20is%20a%20public%20service!&amp;text=The%20coin%20no%20longer%20has,stealing%20to%20pick%20it%20up.

Where's that at?
---
I always seem to get a one star drop off 3 star boss when i kill them too quick or easily / one shot u get a one star ,  
---
So i played around with it / killed the mobs let the boss mutate and regen , the toy with it on a beez dic of health before killing them / and then i get a 3 star -  also iv tried changjng the weapon i use to both take most
---
Of their life and finish  them with / but all thats random 
---
Is the one shot kill that stand up almost everytime
---
It was the exclusive in the paratrooper bundle. Gone.
---
🥺😰
---
So 12 per minute, 72 per hour. Not great, considering you can get over 100 acid in like 10 minutes if you hit up Sunken Trainyard/Tanagra Town/Dolly Sods Wilderness/Toxic Larry's.
---
Oh i see btw i was curious because i been playing fallout 76 on a xbox one x for a few months previously without this bugs. Then 2 days ago i started using my xbox one s and noticed this glitch occurring btw thanks for the response.
---
PC, not a console.  This bug has been happening for well over a year.  Thankfully it is fairly rare, but I'm not certain what causes it.  You go to ADS and stay stuck in ADS mode, but it's not actual ADS as you don't have the same ADS accuracy.
---
just sucks because i genuinely do like this game despite ALL the problems, don’t realize they are pushing people away.
---
Lots of players request lots of things to be added to the game.  If BGS tried to fulfill all these requests then this would be Star Citizen 76.  Obviously no one thinks they should fulfill all requests and suggestions, but unfortunately when a single person is not getting the thing they want it can feel like they don't listen to their players.
---
Nope. 
---
We don’t know if the current ability of Herbivore/Carnivore to boost the “bonus” from food is a bug or not. It could very well be performing as intended, since it’s literally doing what the mutation says it does (double benefit from consuming respective food types). It just hasn’t had this specific behavior before, but maybe the past behavior was actually the bug that’s now been fixed. 
---
And eating food does not give you XP. the only thing vaguely related here is eating foods that boost Int or XP gain, because those are doubled. But again, it’s performing as the mutation describes it to perform, so you can’t call that an exploit.
---
You, on the other hand, are discussing a bug/exploit. You were not treated like you were robbing the Crown Jewels or talking about a dupe, because you weren’t forum banned or account banned. You were simply given a warning not to talk about an exploit. A warning. Entirely appropriate for a low-level bug/exploit. 
---
If you want to inform Bethesda of an exploit to get it fixed, there’s ways to do that non-publicly. What you do was basically the scenario of my first reply- “hey guys! Don’t do this really advantageous thing I’ll tell you exactly about!”.
---
There is some bos paints and under armors u can get. That’s about it
---
Yes?
---
Edit: Ah I see it in other threads now.  Linings do not apply correctly.
---
Geesh, talk about intentionally missing the point..
---
&gt; In California, it is a crime to keep any property of any value that you find. Put another way, you can’t keep lost property that you find (penal code section 485).
---
Obviously it doesn’t work everywhere, but copypasting something like this on a freaking analogy kinda ruins it doesn’t it?
---
And it does not matter who is in charge of what. Bethesda’s approach is all wrong and instead of punishing the players for picking up the penny it should be looking into not dropping pennies so much...
---
This post is a completely justified reaction to something as minor and stupid as this.
---
Alas, the only way you can guarantee not losing a workshop to PvP is to have a private world.
---
Even then, the hours you spend building will be lost when you log off/the server resets.
---
I wasn't trying be a duck about I was just saying fallout probably gonna say na to fixing it😂
---
But then people would just use them on atom shop items
---
That's what I want how do you get the paint?
---
Yes, it's broken. Ask for a refund, or wait for it to be patched
---
5 dollars for fucking black!?     
---
Fucking black?!!?
---
Congrats. And spend time with them! They level up fast!
---
I can confirm this I got some the other day. Bought the high capacity back pack mod with them.  From the campfire tales event at camp Adam. Really rare to get them though.
---
I want to learn that too
---
Oh yeah dude, you're probably already fucked. You'll be getting the email shortly 😉
---
Been wanting this forever. I always wanted enclave v brotherhood
---
&gt; also you can save your constructions in schematics and rebuild them easily.
---
  
---
Yes, but no. The blueprints (I think that's what you mean by schematics, right?) are ridiculously limited; you can save a basic structure of maybe twenty, thirty elements, but going beyond that is impossible, and also useless because there is no way you could get a complicated build to fit in the same spot, let alone another spot. There may be a blade of grass in the way.
---
I don't think he's awake often enough to achieve any of this.
---
While I LOVE the design of the bubble man armors, I like playing a sniper character so I guess I won’t be using power armor much (still only level 27 so who knows though). I’m definitely keen on getting the Jangles backpack though. I’m rank 31 on the legendary run now so I’ll try my best...
---
Also Watoga highschool!
---
You don't know about the food and I don't know about this grenade either because it's never been in the game before and it's effect is so weak and pathetic I'm not even sure what's supposed to be happening. No worries man, carry on.
---
I'm sure a Constitutional Lawyer would like to hear about this one. Just saying. lol
---
Oh i see btw i was curious because this bug started occurring 2 days ago after switching from a xbox one x to a xbox one s. I heard PC is better than console so it might be a coincidence instead of the system btw that's exactly whats been happening lately too
---
Nice find, I gotta go see that one myself now. I always wondered if there was actually anything to find underwater.
---
Nope. I had lvl 9-14s bugging the shit out if me the other night. I'm giving plans and chems out like Santa. They decide they were gonna attack me while I'm afk. Dude...I'm lvl 115. At first it was cute. Then it got annoying like a puppy nipping at your heels as you walk. Finally, I shoot the one in the face. I wouldn't execute them. I love having new blood on the xbox, but not annoying people.
---
Are you fucking serious?
---
Of course it's an exploit.  Why is this even a question?  The literal definition of an exploit is a bug or glitch that can be used to a players advantage in a way not intended by the games designers.
---
The intended result of equipping a grenade is being able to throw said grenade... not being able to break the fuck out of your reload speed.
---
If you're going around saying "HEY GUYS IF YOU DO THIS YOU CAN RELOAD SUPER FAST!" you're promoting an exploit and if you're apparently doing it in their official forums of fucking course you're going to get yelled at.
---
This isn't a harmful bug that needs to be reported to the community so they can avoid it, it's the kind of bug that's easily replicated and totally untracable so the best defense against it until it's fixed is it staying under the communities radar.  You don't run to a forum and tell everyone how to take advantage of it, you send a report straight to bethesda so they can address it and that's it.
---
How salty did getting yelled at make you  that you had to run to reddit to cry that Bethesda is being mean to you?
---
From a certain perspective, this is what a completionist does in every Elder Scrolls and Fallout game.
---
The thing is it’s not about the final reward, it’s the fun you can choose to have in between. If the whole goal is just collecting trinkets and squeezing for extra numbers... not fun.
---
The best place to get technical data is level 3 lock boxes or file cabinets, 
---
but the sure way to always get them is inside the nuke silo launch room, there is around 10 or so file cabinets that you can search and it will be in one of them
---
I am guessing, maybe, some perk reduction weight shit is not working well after you fast travel.
---
Something similar happens with some shooting perks, which stop working and get fixed by equipping/unequipping. Some other perks need to be set in a specific order to work. 
---
And that's why I don't specialise anymore. This games conspires against its own micromanagement.
---
It should have been a reward for collecting all the bobbleheads, I'd have preferred it over atoms. Same thing with magazines - I'd love smaller racks or shelves with each kind all on display.
---
This guy didn't get yelled at for equipping a grenade, they got yelled at because they decided it would be a great idea to run around telling people how to take advantage of a bug and exploit the shit out of it.  
---
That's literally like the number two thing you do not do when you find an exploitable bug.  the first being don't fucking do it again.
---
Better be in a private server. Would be messed up bogging public servers like that.
---
I’m a gamepass player so haven’t spent money on the game yet. When I started seeing other player’s camps I was amazed, and started thinking that I’d be willing to buy cosmetics too... but then I ran into issues like build budget, not being able to put cool items on display (eg power armor and Jangles), I got an error saying I couldn’t place my camp even though the outline was green so I had to rebuild it entirely... yeah... nah... my willingness to spend money on camp stuff is fading fast. Which is a real bummer considering how many hours I poured into it in FO4...
---
They patched Adrenaline on  the last PTS update, try again.
---
I'm not wealthy enough to own a private world, and I don't see why anyone would choose to pay for that.  
---
I don't mind the builds getting lost once you log off though, gives you a fresh start every day, haha.
---
I've gotten side tracked several nights just walking underwater to see if there was anything. 
---
There are a few safes here and there if I remember correctly. The one I remember specifically was between the Nuka-Cola plant and Camden Park.
---
I'm pretty sure that MOST people don't meant to be dicks. If they knew your background and that you invested a lot of time until building there they probably leave you alone. But at the same time there are a lot of fuckwits out there! 
---
My advice would be: 
---
1) if you enjoy building in workshops stick to private servers - you're leaving yourself wide open there. 
---
2) consider building on your main account and blueprint what you can and slap it down in workshops. 
---
3) buy a secondary account and use your main account to build a camp for them. This means you will need 2 versions of the game running at the same time and unfortunately you won't be able to build any Atom Shop items for them. 
---
4) otherwise build camps for the other characters on your main account, but that means you will have to learn all of the plans again.
---
I run a Brotherhood group on PC and we have a few old lads and like to help each other out. If you need a hand out there, let me know.
---
Tell them you did it on accident. I've done it a few times lol
---
If you didn't see it, they added cinderblock wallpaper today! I built a warehouse (for crane's treasure hunter sign) camp with interior walls out today. Was excited to actually have a use for the sign.
---
I bashed out at a bloody power armour build to level 80 this past week and what Ive learnt is that Im every bit as tanky as my full health junkie, thanks to Dodgy, Ricochet and Emergency Protocols (which are insane). The only difference is that the bloodied build has 3× the damage at 10× the range with 20× the fire rate compared to my junkies.
---
And that starts the needed quest?  Getting tech docs
---
I just tried this again, and you're right I can use Super Stimpaks with the hotkey if i'm not carrying anything lesser - but the Stats window still shows 'Stimpak (0)' so I can't use it from there, and Diffusers are unusable for both.
---
Even so, Super Stimpaks weren't useable with the hotkey last time I tested it, which was admittedly at least a patch or two ago.
---
I'll edit my post. Thanks 😬
---
I know the food can’t be considered an exploit, because it’s literally behaving exactly as the description states. 
---
The fireworks don’t say anything about increasing reload speed, and there’s no logical reason they should.
---
So I kinda broke into someone's shit like this didn't take anything just picked the lock as I haven't figured out how to do it myself yet anywho 2 dudes came to my camp shot the shit out of me for the reward I took my ass kicking and they were nice enough not to destroy my camp 
---
Just saying if you be a dick even by accident (I didn't know picking a lock would be like stealing just wanted to see about the harvester) take ya ass kicking and go about you way
---
You're wasting your breath.  I've lost track of how often I've tried to explain console certs to the idiots in this sub.  Every time there's even the slightest bug they expect a hotfix to be pushed out the same day to fix it and the fact that never happens is all the proof they need that Bethesda is hopelessly incompetent.
---
I used it to grind kills, more than once.
---
East across the river from harpers ferry. There are usually 2 in the flat treed area next to the dam.
---
Welcome to 76, friend.
---
“I don’t like it but I’m going to buy it anyway because I have OCD and then I will blame you for my spending habits and then the next new thing I see and don’t like I shall also buy and then I will blame...”
---
Fasnacht has made them near extinct. They are now part of a breeding program at a hidden location to increase their numbers. I hear they feed them autocomplete score points as an aphrodisiac.
---
It was recently patched in I believe and I’m glad it was. I thought the same with the diffusers and when they didn’t work I tossed em
---
Nice. In gonna get a refund for the green thumb bundle then I bought it for the domes but they never quite worked
---
Angry joe like. $20 for BLUE?! $20 for blue power armor!!!
---
Any weapon capable of causing + limb damage can cripple the legs with a single shot. 
---
Then, you can use explosives.
---
Profitable dead weight is still dead weight.
---
If this was a purely PC game, or hell if they'd just put PC and console on different versions, they could be updating this game any time they want.  Other games out there that already work on this system can have hotfixes out within hours of a patch.  Someone finds an exploit?  Patched.  Something's bugged and breaks?  Patched.  
---
The sad truth is that consoles are what's holding this game back.
---
Take a look down below the cliff, for some reason it spawns down there just chillin till you shoot it.
---
Console player here too.
---
I rhink the game already has the mechanic in place. Just need coding.
---
You favorite the stim u want hotkeyed. If you are out it defaults back to the stims u have. If you're an idiot and favorite all of them I say make it random ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I've got a TSE The Dragon sitting on ice right now, I think base damage on my rifleman was 1400? Also had a 1 star Instigating. If anybody remembers, there used to be a glitch where as long as you started the reload animation, toggling the dpad to switch weapons didn't prevent your weapon from completing the reload, so when fighting scorchedbeasts or any tough enemy I would just swap from dragon to dragon repeatedly.
---
Those were the days.
---
Great flyboy bundle.
---
And all the high levels players will collectively choose the same faction because of the rep.
---
You NEVER accuse someone on a public forum, even doing that here will get you a strike or suspension.  Witch hunts are serious business.  If you need to report a cheater or an exploit there are already non-public channels to do so.
---
Or just pay someone 1000 caps for a shielded Harness which buffs all the VATS relevant stats
---
Also, dont be surprised if you receive a temp ban in the future if you do it.
---
I like the idea, but then the other allys will need some other benefit or no one would use them.
---
There’s more monetization because they have less overall to work with, less players only with whatever subscriptions and atom transactions they can get.  Not millions in subscriptions plus DLC that’s paid for plus continued sale of the game in general. 
---
Fallout 76 is only getting to use whatever money fallout 76 is getting.  Like I said at the start, they aren’t going to take extra money from something like ESO to fund something in FO76 unless they can determine that there will be substantial return on investment.   With them hemorrhaging players they seem to have doubled up their efforts.  
---
Bottom line, in my opinion, nothing is going to change.  If you don’t like it, your best bet is to quit.  If you stick around, don’t expect to be heard.  It’s very clear that they aren’t listening.  Nothing is going to change - even if they could, even if they should, they simply aren’t going to.
---
Can confirm that you can still get it (unsure of the XP amount though). 
---
I got it the other day.
---
Sucks that they vault everything
---
Different vendors sell some other from turning in tech data
---
Might I suggest aquaboy and going to the lake and river, or being one with the bushes? Best exp method is staying alive.
---
That's what you get when you make the insult bot angry.
---
Cinderblock wallpaper and large potted succulents were the only thing that caught my eye this week. I wear clothing over my armor. No need for secret service stuff. I want those junk walls that were datamined. Also to go with those, I would love some raider/scavver junk prefabs like fo4 had.
---
I feel your frustration, i lost a total of 9,000 score today. it's like they want to drive away their players? the already drove me away once last year around before halloween all the way until late january. they're trying real hard to do it again.
---
That doesn't work for me. Or are you saying that is your suggestion? Cos that would actually be perfect!
---
It's a loot bag skin. Replacer for the standard brown paper bag
---
*not an actual spaceship* it's a common construct you will find in playgrounds.
---
Its 3 per quest and you can get 2-3 a day so not quite 150 days
---
Patch has broken a lot of things.
---
It’s a skin for the paper bag. It was in the atom store a few weeks back
---
I still havent done a 4/4 scavengers 100 ore Rad Rumble😎
---
Usually happens when there are many players present
---
All the time at the one in the mire.  Usually when it’s just me and things go to hell pretty fast.
---
Two wrongs don’t make a right.
---
It's really really easy to stay fed ans hydrated maybe try doing that
---
Often
---
Just a miniature version
---
Blocker and Ricochet are a fantastic combo.  Peewn!
---
And Serendipity is a bloodied player’s best friend!
---
Nvm I misread initially but I made a shielded one today on ps4. It worked for me, I'd submit a ticket if it isn't for you after rebooting/server hopping
---
Suggestion
---
Not entirely true. For a good minigun to kill the queen you need to at least reload several times when you solo, but with a ‘magic’ mini you can get the job done before reloading even once.
---
you have to buy the shield lining with gold bullion at vault 79.  i think it was 200 gold
---
Blame the victim...
---
Without owning the access to makes a private server, you shouldn't really consider workshops as empty sandboxes. 
---
Workshops are the last bastion for PvP. With them being daily challenges 4 times a week, you should not expect everyone to not challenge your claim. 
---
If you want private workshops, get a private server. It's a months worth of private building time for the price of filling meal at McDonald's.
---
No, hunny, it looks just fine and it doesn't make your butt look big. Look we have reservations a 8 can you hurry up?
---
That's how Bethesda rolls. "We will never fix the exploits, but don't you dare mention the exploits!!".
---
I'd advise against it. But if you absolutely have to, don't place it in your main camp.
---
Ever since they released the broken “silent” Shadow Prime skin, I’ve been buying every broken atom shop item and requesting a refund. I get a refund every time and the item eventually gets fixed. 
---
If they want to continue releasing broken shit, I’ll continue getting refunds.....
---
Purdy gud
---
If you're on PC you can change the color by editing the .ini no need for mods
---
You speak the truth &amp; yet you're downvoted
---
Unfortunately, I don't think so.
---
Main camp? I only have one
---
Jesus Fucking Christ... they didn't "exclude" mods from this game because they can make money selling us shit in  the atom shop.  They did it because you literally can't run mods like we did in other Fallout games.  
---
You can swap assets and that's it.  You can't just add new weapons, armors or camp furniture, enemies, mechanics and features or any of the shit we're used to doing to old Fallout games to a game hosted on Bethesda's servers.
---
This isn't Bethesda being dicks, this is about the facts that you're not installing shit on your own privately hosted server and you're just using one of theirs temporarily, that ostensibly your characters and other peoples need to be able to move back and forth between private and public servers and other people need to be able to join private worlds without needing to have a different set of mods all installed on their client for all the different possible combinations private server hosts could have available.
---
Just wanted to say I’m happy you’ve recovered.  See you in the wasteland!
---
I remember when this game first came out, there was a very dedicated older age player who went around and found bugs/glitches to report to Bethesda in hopes that they'd fix it. They thanked him with a permaban. Dude had like a crazy amount of hours spent playing the game, like, everyday no sleep type of hours. I can only imagine the heartbreak of your favorite game company doing that to you.
---
if you are on PC I'll open a private world you can run a few workshops safely in sometime. appalachia@: bludybowlingpin
---
Just build them in Workshops. 
---
You could also build in an Alt accounts camp if you have one (PC).
---
So have I and there have also been many times where she didn’t land before tents were in the game. My point is that you cannot say that is definitely the case. It’s certainly possible, but without a controlled environment/study with hundreds or thousands of tries, we cannot be certain.
---
Yes but this method requires no travel or server hopping. There are plenty of other ways to acquire acid like you mentioned, I was providing another way for people that may be interested.
---
This one was a normal tent
---
Now see that’s one I CAN cross off lol. No credit to me, I’m always a runner in that event and just grab ore, the real rockstars kept everyone alive haha. No idea how
---
Its the only throne I have, my place of solitude
---
I know they don't mean to be dicks, I'm just trying to find out why they're being mean dicks to me:) This whole PvP thing (I don't even know what it means but I'm guessing fighting with other players) is probably a major part of the game for a lot of people, so I don't want to get in their way either. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.  
---
I have no idea what you mean by main account and secondary account. The game is okay, but very laggy and too limited for me to spend more money on it, if that would be what you're suggesting.  
---
I'd love to sign up to a group as long as it doesn't mean I have to go out and do silly things like act we're all in the military (been there IRL, done that IRL, it's useless). Also, the faction sounds very gender specific, haha. I like to have other genders around. :)
---
I wish there’s inspection feature so we know what we’re looking at. Otherwise they are really like weapon skin showcase at best.
---
This happens like 80% of the time for me when I use an ultracite gatling laser. I didn't realize this happened with other heavy weapons, but it's especially annoying for me because then I end up with a bunch of almost depleted fusion cores weighing me down until I get a chance to drop them.
---
I was a level 6 and it wasn't too bad.  It was a little frustrating.  I hatevNW, but the past few days have worked out good for score.
---
The log out/in should only be 5 minutes, when you log back in, dont go to your map for at least 5 minutes.
---
I can buy Atoms just fine.
---
/s
---
Dude this game feels like a free to play...
---
I did.
---
and i get downvoted because im “bitchin”? it sucks because ill probably continue playing because i do like it, but so many things hurt my head with this game. maybe angry joe was right...
---
This gets posted literally every other day. I guess we’re just trying to wear them down at this point...
---
At the very least, this would also make sense
---
Know what I did when I first encountered this bug?  I swapped out my weapon and it returned to normal.  I didn't run to Bethesda's official forum and paint a giant target on my forehead that said "HEY I'M GONNA TELL EVERYONE HOW TO EXPLOIT THIS BUG!"
---
He didn't get in trouble for exploiting the bug, he got in trouble because he broke one of the cardinal rules of finding an exploit.  You don't fucking spread it.
---
He isn't a victim.
---
The response should be ‘we’ll fix the game’ not piss on you for talking about it. Fuck sake.
---
only seen it in the mire and it's intentional. Nearly caked me duds. I was on my level 25 alt and was not prepared for one never mind 2.
---
You can work around this with rep modifiers if teams are vastly different average rank
---
My unarmed character can punch heavily with no weapons. I believe explosives also count if you are not equipping a gun.
---
Yeah pretty much anything full auto does that to me when there's lots of action, the worst is when it reloads gatling lasers and kicks out a 10% fusion core
---
TBH the PVE crowd on there just baits people into saying shit so they can get them banned. *That's why you need to be on the prowl and report them for baiting.*
---
A+ its a shame there's no conventions happening so you could show off all the hard work
---
Blocker for sure
---
Other raw healing items work too like salves
---
Sometimes that doesn't even work. They take you money and just forget to apply your Atoms.
---
Maybe they could make older ones available for purchase via Atoms to subscribers?? 
---
That’d be nice! ✌️
---
It will be lucky to survive to Xmas
---
Ah okay, thank you. Jeez, considering how long I’ve played the game and the description I gave, I probably should have pieced that together on my own.
---
Yeah my friend informed me of that earlier, but I don't know where they sit in the priority order so I didn't include it so as to not make it confusing. Thanks for letting me know, though!
---
Haven’t you people learned yet?
---
Awe. Congratulations.
---
maybe iron fist, but I’m not 100% sure
---
I’ve got level 2 explosive and level 3 ninja. Power attacks using X-01 with Tesla braces does about 177 damage on the Watoga bots.
---
So some people have mentioned it being a blood eagle or related to them in some way. Nearby is the "Seneca Gang Camp" and it is absolutely filled with those thorned spikes with barbed wire, just like the bird has in it. It's also in a great position to be seen by them. Shot in the dark but I wonder if they killed it, pinned it there, then named themselves after it? No clue but those spikes are the same as the ones in the camp. Might be reused assets but who knows.
---
near site alpha. Has a bit of flat shore but you could build out on to the water. 
---
Around twin lakes. same deal.
---
A better question is why are you so heavily invested in this?
---
I lost over 4K SCORE this past weekend. It’s particularly painful for it to happen on one of the few days that they did Double SCORE Dailies. 😒
---
Its a paint to apply when modding the minigun.
---
FYI they fixed the asbestos roof “bug” that made it have a lower budget cost than other roofs.
---
I'm humbled by the offer, but I have no idea how to take it up.  
---
I am of course PC, both political correct and on Windows10.
---
And game developers are supposed to develop games.
---
i still have hope for that thanksgiving shelf.
---
IMO it shout be a paint.
---
If it worked like the secret service armor you spent gold on, then you’d all be complaining about that too 🤪
---
Why is that a better question?
---
That guy.
---
Was a douchnozzle.
---
Level 10 *anything* is fragile, you can't help but 1 shot them. You will not face any negative consequences, amd frankly, anyone who says they'll report you for killing a lvl 10 wolf, probably doesn't have 1 friend, let alone 50.
---
If you're going to build in the workshops, remain crouched in stealth. If I'm there building anything, like I did this evening for the weekly challenge, I just stay crouched and sneak around in the workshop. This isn't foolproof, because there will always be the handful of people who are just scrapping to use your efforts for their entertainment, but it will definitely extend your building time.
---
Should because fist are affected by iron fist
---
You don’t get to set the rules of the sub. 
---
If you don’t like the rules, then you should leave. 
---
That’s how Reddit works. That’s how all privately owned forums work. 
---
Want a forum with different rules?  Go make your own.
---
Can you message me when you find out
---
Honestly looking back, I hate that I feel like I would've gotten way more bang for my buck had I been patient with ESO and slowly bought the expansion packs over time. Plus, I want to love 76 so fucking bad and at times I do but it hurts how much fucking potential you can see. The potential is right in your face and im constantly questioning why so much of it isn't used and why so many things don't work how they should. Its shameful and it makes me wary of Bethesda. At this point idk what to think of the next ES game. Granted its gunna be a while but I'm losing faith in Bethesda. CDPR seems to be the only dev group that honestly gives a solid fuck about fans and wants them to be happy and idk what to think of Ubi right now (depends on if the fuck up valhalla). They gaming climate feels like its getting worse and worse.
---
Edit: autocorrect apparently had a fucking aneurysm and can't spell for shit.
---
Are you hearing it too?
---
Huh... I had no idea! Didn't think it'd even be possible to get one of those towers - kinda figured they'd be too tall for the height limits on camps, but I'd love to be wrong about that! Would *really* like to have one of those!
---
Though yeah, I agree, it's weird they have so much material available, and yet they seem to keep repeating the same things over and over again... :/
---
Yeah, but the minigun was gone next time I logged on
---
As far as I know there isn't such a place you kinda have to pick water source or view. There's an awesome place in the top right of the map near one of the ski lodges and a substation that has a pretty awesome view looking North but it's pretty close to manognah mine which is gonna be nuked to hell here pretty soon if you want to check it out I have my camp there right now I'm on Xbox same gt as here.
---
Someone said it was a "casual underarmor" so you would need that plan.
---
I think part of it, lore wise, its only been a few decades. The ones from previous games have built up alpha predator status over 200 years. Growing stronger, taaking on the scorch and surviving to become the recognized champion we love and miss(but in the future somehow)
---
Why isn't it?
---
You bought a gilded minigun or bought the plans to MAKE a gilded minigun?
---
Did you play nuclear winter before it started happening. After every nuclear winter match I get that in adventure.
---
I think priority is based on health lost (not sure of rads are taken into account)
---
I have seen posts from people claiming that after refund, bughesda didn't remove the purchased item. Meaning you got a refund and got to keep the item you bought after been refunded. Has this happened to you?
---
This. Happy cake day.
---
Video released today. Very clear summary and demonstration.

The process to get it is not fun either.  It's just the same fetch quest 100 times.
---
They jusy looking around thinking "WTF?"
---
You could try playing late or early... you know to avoid the children, usually a tried and true strategy in most games. Tends to not work during holidays though.
---
PvP is player vs player. If you're not into it, it's best to keep Pacifist mode on and avoid all together. 
---
By secondary account I mean buying the game twice and running them both at the same time on PC. A lot of people do it as it just makes things like inventory management a lot easier. But it's not for everyone and completely understandable why people don't want to do it. 
---
We are a Brotherhood of Steel group. There are RP Lite elements but all of that is completely optional. There is no requirement to act, dress etc in a certain way. 
---
Brotherhood is by name only, we are in no way restricted to males and we have people of all genders. We are majority males, but I think you'd find that for most groups out there and we definitely don't descriminate. 
---
Pretty much we're just a group of more mature gamers who like to help each other out with a bit of a Brotherhood flavour.

Bought a mod that I could one time use applie to my minigun. Been playing since beta and I never saw it before.
---
I hear it after being near the guided meditation area
---
TLDR didn’t get best drop ever must be a big and it’s not fair. This post is so overused for no reason
---
My Gatling plasma does this all of the time now! But it's the only heavy weapon that does this to me. It's faster fire rate. My .50 faster fire rate and Vampire's faster fire rate minigun do NOT have issues with this.
---
Well you’re a true hero.
---
As I said, I'm just trying to figure out why they do this. I don't mind them claiming the workshop for an event they have to fulfill, that's part of the game and I understand. The part I don't understand is why they get pissed off when I reclaim it. Haven't they already got what they want?  
---
Also: I don't have the money for a private server, so that's not an option, and I have no idea what a filling meal at McDonalds is.
---
Yes!!  I did. 
---
I thought maybe I was having a stroke or stuck in a Seinfeld episode.
---
60 DR might be like 5% or so when stacked on top of the rest of your 400dr, it's a drop
---
The Back-words Logic is just freaking hilarious! Oh, well no one knows about this bug so it is all fine.
---
Yeah I get a baseline whenever I fast travel or do anything after NW.
---
It's an visual bug caused by lag. If you look at the ammo count when firing your weapon it will go to zero, and instantly jump to some odd number number and start reloading like it should.
---
Let the side be chosen randomly. Winning gives more rep, but you still get some even if you lose ("thanks for helping us out. We'll get them next time!").
---
If you're on pc, I'd take it
---
Look just watch this [Juicehead video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) first, and tell me I am wrong about this.
---
You will need to complete the quest "Defiance has Fallen" first.
---
Then, you need to loot Technical Data from somewhere in the world.  This will start the repeatable quest "Forbidden Knowledge".  To finish the quest, you deposit the tech data in the little red box on the wall in teh basement of one of the buildings at Camp Venture.  You will receive some random loot.  You have a *very* small percentage of a chance to get the plans for BOS paint skins for power armor.  You get these paint skins in a specific order.  For instance, when you finally receive the first skin, it will be the Knight Paint.  You **must** learn the plan by reading it in order to *ever* receive the next skin.  The game keeps track of whether or not you've learned the first plan before it will give you a chance at getting the next ones (Knight Sergeant and Knight Captain).
---
Don’t care didn’t ask plus you’re cringe
---
I believe the gilded paint was changed to the Lucille's Lullaby atom shop paint scheme, so I think what you bought isn't supposed to exist anymore.
---
Great review. Definitely seems like a missed opportunity if they added in damage markers onto them for a lot more people wanting them to test out their weapons and compete with a static damage metric
---
Sadly, I'm on Xbox. Good luck with your own!
---
Can they be sold?
---
Plus, if you modded a gilded minigun (not Lucille's Lullaby) it would lose the paint scheme
---
Bingo.
---
This is a bug with every door in the game!
---
Every door does that to me lately.  If I try to open a door, it swings open real fast, then goes back to the closed position, so I have to click open again for it to finally open.  It was super annoying at first, but I'm so used to it by now that I don't even think about it anymore.

Dude,I have no idea why It happened...
---
But I will say I have been trying too get the Urban Scout mask for like two weeks,multiple different trades/offers &amp; blahzay blah,&amp; have still,NOT been able to  acquire one,so I sorta feel yer pain.
---
I’d say submit a ticket in yer situation,especially if you have photo proof,&amp; hope fer the best.
---
Sorry we have such shibby luck yo
---
Stay Blessed
---
Stay Healthy
---
lol perfect
---
Still waiting for the X-02 PA skin :(
---
You get my upvote.  I am so tired of these posts.
---
You should have recorded it, that sounds hilarious.
---
Double score feels like the level the score always should have been paying out from the beginning!
---
To follow up on this and what someone else has said, you can only turn in one Technical Data at a time.  When you grab the first tech data, it will start the quest - if you grab other tech data before you turn in the first one, these will be duds and you can never use them for anything other than selling them.  SOMETIMES, you might have multiples in your inventory that are showing as separate items (e.g. you may have a stack of 4, and then a stack of just one by itself even after turning one in).  You MIGHT be able to drop the one that is by itself and then pick it back up to start the quest again.  I have had this work *one* time for me, but your mileage may vary.  The best practice for this quest is to just immediately go turn in the tech data as soon as you loot the first one. 
---
The best place to loot these is from the colored circular file cabinets or the computer desks in the military wing of Whitesprings.  Other desks and file cabinets have a smaller chance to contain them.
---
Late and early also tends to differ around the globe :)
---
"They did it because you literally can't run mods like we did in other Fallout games."
---
Sure. That's why they said mods were definitely going to be in the game when they talked about it *pre-launch*, then confirmed mods around launch, then confirmed mods again in late 2019. They even implied that mods would be coming specifically for 1st servers since it was listed for the future when they released them.
---
Beside that, there's no good reason we can't run our own persistent private servers with FO4 style modding (just like the subscription servers but better!) Plenty of other games have done it, it's no great obstacle for a studio with Bethesda's resources. In the last 6 months alone my brother has messed around using mods and private servers for Conan Exiles, 7 Days to Die, and Rust. If this game doesn't have private servers then that's on Bethesda, and since they promised mods, I'm sure they were aware of the challenges involved.
---
I never claimed this was about Bethesda being dicks though. Let's not replace the pursuit of profit and an inexplicable negligence for their game with mean-spiritedness. I don't blame the lower level employees but at this point the overreaching monetization and lacklustre game update quality are speaking volumes about what matters most to the people calling the shots.
---
Thanks.  I have a two shot AGL as my backup weapon,  would love a TSE revolver for my main weapon.
---
I have all the casual plans,it is not, when you choose it the options are from the ss category.
---
ive been having it for over a month
---
I passed the intelligence check and fixed the programs. My reward was... Unsatisfactory
---
These posts wouldn't exist if the bug didn't. 
---
It's quite easy to ignore and keep scrolling.
---
Thank you!
---
been experiencing this for a bit now. frustrating as hell. especially on my quad tesla. It's probably the most annoying on my quad tesla, cause it reloads at 15 or 30 rounds left.
---
I think you'd better look for a .44 type revolver instead of the single action. This thing is awful at just about everything.
---
Don’t mean to sound rude or negative. But I have been playing since launch, almost everyday. I have almost 1800 hours in this game, with ONE character. And I have never ‘lost’ anything. I just don’t understand how you guys do it? By you guys, I mean the people that post this crap. If you really ‘lost’ an item? Buy it back? Trade for it? Do something besides make a post about you ‘losing’ something. Btw, I have a full time job, I pay bills like most other people, I have a girlfriend, I have kids. And yet, I have never ‘lost’ an item. Either you made a mistake, or were to high, or distracted..... either way? It’s your fault. Deal with it. And stop making posts about this sh*t. No offense.
---
Extras can be sold.  I think they only sell for 1-2 caps a piece though.  They're not worth the hassle.  Just toss them on the ground.
---
Well maybe Joe should ask Bethesda to fix there game
---
You know, I never kill the former raiders that Rocksy sends me after. They just want to be free, so I tell them to get out of Appalachia and it's over and done with. There's no need for more death when humanity is already endangered as it is.
---
Oh joy....
---
Nah they asshoes
---
They probably want the resources that come with the workshop. Or they specifically want to experience the gameplay that comes with defending the territory they just claimed. 
---
So, no, they haven't gotten what they wanted. 
---
I get it, building is fun. I like to build. It's my endgame. But workshops, as poorly implemented as they are, are about player versus player first and building defenses to defend from people or creatures second. There will always be a chance for someone to come and decide that they want to set down extractors. 
---
As for the McDonald's thing, fallout 1st is like $13 a month. If you're spending hours at a time building online only to have something come and grab your stuff, you really have to weigh it against potential money spent versus product used.
---
What?  Your being sarcastic
---
Synths aren't advanced enough to pass for human at this point in the timeline yet.
---
I take it by your username you live in AZ and you like Sage ; )
---
I used to call my dog 'sagetoes'... loved the way her feet smelled when she came back from running around through the sage bushes
---
The single action IS a .44 caliber, unless they've changed it. I haven't played much at all since the legendary run dropped.
---
So why is that? Do they have to claim a workshop owned by another player or just any workshop?  
---
Continuously crouching while building is a drag though, even if it works. You'd have to build many stairs to be able to select the upper parts of you build :)
---
But you can get suspended for telling the guy to go f**k himself and i suspect thats probably what he was trying to achieve.
---
This. You have no idea how many times people will just run over to kill the ghouls I have just put on the ground, to try and give us all some breathing room to get ore.
---
I keep a QE 90 combat shotgun on me for it, but more often then not it gets stopped by kill happy teammates.
---
When reporting bugs just use Discord from now on. The Back-words Logic of these Bethesda Defenders on here is just freaking hilarious!
---
mabye if they fixed it, but na that is to crazy
---
Sound like a mega-asshole
---
&gt; logged in after 9a, perused the new stuff in Atomic Shop
---
This is the cause. It's totally fucked and needs to be addressed but going to the Atom shop first is one of the causes. Pretty sure you don't even have to buy anything. The problem is just going there.
---
After the weekly/daily reset, don't do anything at all until you log into an adventure server.
---
I’ve had that particular mask since level 40 or so, and I’m currently 423.
---
That'll be 1800 atoms
---
Apologies! It's the same damage effect as regular posters.
---
"Fallout 76 is only getting to use whatever money fallout 76 is getting."
---
That's the problem. How do you know that Fallout 76 is benefiting from any reasonable amount of the money Fallout 76 is getting? 
---
My criticisms are based on the premise that the monetization keeps increasing while the quality of the game does not, particularly in regards to updates to base-game earnables but also just what I see as a persistent lack of high quality updates in general. People are being drip-fed cash shop items and now season run grind to keep them occupied and paying. 
---
Bottom line, I already did quit. This post was announcing that.
---
I have this issue with my buddy as well, and neither of us were banned. He can see me, but I can’t see him. If I try to add him as a friend, it says I’m already friends?! Just started one day, and been like that for a couple of weeks now. I’ve done everything short of uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Also on PS4.
---
Didn't they have to refund people in Australia, too?
---
Okay was just repeating a fellow redditor which can be very risky as you well know.  O well thought the thing looked hidious anyways.  Have a good night.
---
You can add me but dm from reddit got comm banned Gt Fanaticocean396
---
Nah, only the weapon paints were bundled together before. The backpack's always been by itself, and both camos are new this week.
---
As long as you’re in an event, it counts as though you’re in a team. Haven’t you noticed everyone’s names show as yellow as though they were all in your team? Sure you can pull sneak crits every now and then, but not as reliably as you would playing privately.
---
Yep, the framework is there for something special. It's been there for almost two years. 
---
Monetization, monetization, monetization. The devs do what they can I guess and the game has improved in a bunch of areas, but ultimately, none that matter enough to counter their need for more money... a need that regularly upsets fun.
---
Oof yeah I'll add you when are you on?
---
- Look for a good bloodied rifle on the market. Fixer or handmade are best.  1 star is all you need. Expect to pay a lot of caps.
---
- Look up how to make a good stealth bloodied rifleman or commando build. The Adrenal Reaction mutation + Nerd Rage are essential for any bloodied build; stay below 20% HP to use these optimally. 
---
- Learn the Ballistic Bock recipe from Biv's daily quests and craft a ton of them. Use map76.com to find ingredients.  
---
- Server hop at The Whitespring to buy Psychotats from The Chemists store in the basement (30% chance to sell, 70-100 caps each, +25% damage for 3 minutes). 
---
- Use both Bock and Psychotats with stealth VATS headshots every time you fight a scorchbeast or any tough enemy.
---
Even if you're right(and you may very well be), at least I wouldn't have 20 bobbleheads taking up stash space if my idea was realized.
---
Agreed! Seems like a great opportunity to add a mini game to camps too, though that might be asking a bit much from Beth.
---
100% agree. I ended up selling my super stims  and diffusers because I'd accumulate normal or diluted and never end up using them when I wanted to. On xbox with the menu lag and favourites wheel not always selecting the right thing it's near impossible to use the stims you want in a fight. It's definitely frustrating when you dump all your diluted but get given some after an event and in the next boss battle try to heal only to realise it was a stupid diluted
---
No you can't :D :D You can get suspended for threatening someone with rl physical violence, and only when you can prove it with an video etc. You can't get suspended for saying a naughty word xDDDDD
---
I think you're the sarcastic one. I just gave you a plethora of information that no one else was giving you direct answers for.  If you don't believe me just go try and sell the damn things and tell me if i'm wrong or not.
---
My Fixer does this but its weird. I'll use the whole mag but when I start to reload it says I have 12 rounds left every time. But I use all 20.
---
Is there a pattern for this bug? Like what were you doing as you logged of before the reset and what mode did you log into?
---
If they just made it damage numbers them we'd make our minigame competing for high score. If Beth wanted to go all out then a display like a carnival strength tester so everyone can see the damage numbers and compete for the high score
---
Un-friend them, then friend them back.
---
I knew that
---
I see a lot of folks wit em,but no one wants to part...
---
You probably/possibly got it back when It was attainable from the vendor at the enclave,or a luck of the draw via RN Geebus considering yer lvl...
---
But I’ll be damned if it isn’t the hardest piece I have ever attempted to acquire.
---
To the point it’s got me mildly flustered.
---
Ricochet? I heard some people saying it’s not worth it since it doesn’t negate the damage it sends back.
---
In a few minute eating remember wont be able to speck got banned from texting
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
All good you got mic or nah?
---
Ahh rewarded twice for killing the insult bot can it get any better
---
Nah but just put follow me when you need me
---
Is it gone now?  I don't remember there being a limited timer on that one.  Should still be for sale right?
---
Why?  Doesn't everyone think skins are cool.  Why would these be any different? And thanks for the info, btw.
---
Nope, I'm only level 60 so I guess new kids think I'm low enough to fuck with. They like to show up to my camp acting like they wanna buy something and then attack. I usually shoot them in the face and drop em. When they come back to get there stuff I kill them over and over again. I never take their shit, just bait them with it till they leave the server. I feel like if I have the courtesy to play peacefully with new kids and even price everything i sell super low in the effort to help them a little i deserve the respect of not being annoyed by low level shitbags. You where definetly in the right.
---
I recently found a solid place to set up in the Mire though so very few low levels can even venture out that way.
---
i just cant stand the bethesda sycophants killing every discussion about everything. its like nothing is allowed to change, and noone is allowed to have fun in their eyes.
---
If there is, I don't think anyone has figured it out.
---
The only thing I did differently was check out the atomic shop, which I usually skip.  But I don't see how it could be that.  So  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Trap base?
---
Alright
---
I felt like it happened more often when it first came out, but maybe its related to what others have said about player count. Also every time ive done it in the mire
---
Bethesda knows about it.  These posts aren't gonna get them to fix it faster. They are pointless and redundant now.  I know that sounds harsh but it is true.
---
Guns, sometimes knives. The odd missile launcher....
---
Bethesda also increase the scrip daily so we can trash shit drops. One star wood nocturnal.. I don't need 30 broken useless shit
---
Huh yeah weird, there were theories floating around about nuclear winter causing it but that seems debunked. 🤷‍♂️
---
It is .44, I meant go for a snubnosed.
---
99% of posts on Reddit are pointless and redundant.
---
Spend all your atoms on the legendary run rewards or you will be behind and miss items that will never be obtainable again like the chicken coop
---
Maybe I missed some of your context.  I assumed you were asking if the extra tech data could be sold.  What I was saying was the extra tech data that you aren't able to turn in can be sold for 1-2 caps.  You can only turn in one at a time right after you loot one, so if you end up with multiples in your inventory, they are useless.
---
However, the BOS paint plans *can also* be sold, and yes, people will pay a good amount for them.
---
Are you daft? I’ve got almost 1,000 hours in this game as well. Never once accidentally salvaged or sold my own equipped gear, and never misplaced any of my valuable items. At most I’ve accidentally sold a scrip item or two, but nothing I’ve ever had marked. Also, other players I’ve known were affected by the inventory steal glitch, so just because you haven’t experienced it, doesn’t mean a thing. Just shows that you’re ignorant to the exploits in this game.
---
It just sounds like you’ve got some immense chip on your shoulder, and want everyone to hear you whine about it. Children act like that, not adults.
---
After 1500 hours and hundreds of queen fights as a bloodied stealth build, I've never had much of an issue with staying in stealth. Even when I'm surrounded by random players.
---
There we go.  *paint plans for a handful of caps what is this place coming to?  That's worse then the nukes!*
---
I don't play on pts so good for you?
---
This is called tunnel vision.
---
Not everyone is playing 20 hours a day grinding. Lots of people play to build, explore with friends, blow stuff up, etc.
---
Yeah. I heard that anything above like 350 DR/ER has diminishing returns. I’m in T-51b and have 506/616/310.
---
Anti armor Plasma rifle with Flamer..MK melts like buttah...
---
Do both. They can't revoke purchases for technical reasons.
---
Like other people mentioned, the Workshops are PVP areas, some players actively seek out players to fight them. Why, I can't really explain it well because I don't fully understand it when there's plenty of workshops on the map where they could go claim one themselves.
---
It used to be there was a Survival Mode to the game in addition to Adventure Mode, the whole world was a PVP zone, with only the top 3 players were visible on the map. Bethesda, chose to eliminate that game mode and all of the people who enjoyed were forced into Adventure mode to use the PVP mechanics that exist in that mode. 
---
The workshops are just the only designated area of the game where some joker can come up and initiate PVP with you by taking what you've been working on, or claiming that area for the resources.
---
A couple of weeks ago, I built a [jetpack park](https://i.redd.it/6wxuawx1gx351.png) in a workshop because you can't build too high of structures in camps, and can't build enough of them to make something like a jet pack park feasible.  I was there playing around with it for a few hours, crouching, then flying over to the other towers. Eventually, I started staying out of stealth to get people to show up, because I sort of wanted to see how other players would react in the jetpack park. Well, I don't PVP really, but I had a ton of fun flying around trying to evade the other players who showed up there, despite getting killed a few times. 
---
It's just different strokes for people you know? Some people like building, some people like fighting with other people and starting shit, and some just want a good story. Bethesda should really bring back the survival mode of the game, it was actually fun, and felt like it had actual consequence to how you built your camp; plus it would return adventure mode to everyone else who just wanted to build or play the story.
---
&gt; you really have to weigh it against potential money spent versus product used
---
There's no real money spent when I'm just building is there? I enjoy building and I don't mind people claiming the workshop, just let me claim it back once you've got your victory, so I can continue.  
---
I don't really care about the builds getting lost either, I know that happens once you quit the game either way, private server or not. And that's sort of cool, I'm part of the punk generation with all the 'destroy to create' stuff and such. :)
---
Things only come off the wall when you apply the initial wallpaper. If you already have some applied you're fine.
---
I’d been offered a large number of legacies for it, and 50k caps on one occasion. Never intended to part with it though. And yeah, I got it on one of my first few enclave events at the Seneca Rocks Visitor Center, before the game was even out a month.
---
Hit E with the power of gods
---
I hear it on public and private servers.
---
Maybe just maybe, release a new game? Or just have a single player mode for fallout 76?
---
Oh let's see magic heavy guns, magic shotguns, legacies, and tryhards (any BFFR rifle player). Melee fell out of favor a while back but if you do it right it is still king for damage.
---
Neither do I but you're the one bitching that they won't fix something that's already fixed and ready in the next patch.
---
I think the map screen shows the accurate stat and the one on the pipboy can be off.
---
Bro thank you sooo much for this info 😀 back to solo play for my stealth commando lol
---
I dont believe the gilded mini gun was ever a mod. It was always found as a pre-painted mini gun and any modification to the mini gun would cause it to loose its paint job.
---
Cheers bro that helps a shit ton
---
I am beyond worried for the BOS release. How much is going to be paid cosmetics, how many will be broken?
---
For some reason it mentions casual linings.. Is it some bullshit where it's under casual now?
---
I threw a dictionary at him. Well actually, my programming would t let me. But I wanted to. Really badly.
---
That's a great way to view it, but you're not catching what I'm throwing. 
---
Just killing you and claiming the workshop isn't "victory" to the people that engage in PvP. The "victory" is claiming it and holding it against all others until they log off. Letting you claim it back is antithetical to the playstyle of PvP activities. Most of the people who go after workshops want you to keep coming back so they can kill you again. 
---
They don't want your permission to claim the workshop. They want to take it, and they'll do it with a storm of lead every time.
---
I was walking in the mire when that ass creeped up behind me. Got me startled and I reflexively shot and killed him. Didn't know I can do that. I shoot it on sight now.
---
Thank you!!
---
I use the ones I can actually get my hands on...
---
🤷‍♂️ bloodied deathclaw gauntlet
---
To be fair, there seems to be no clear pattern to this bug.. so tehyre probably having trouble nailing it down.
---
Is it excusable? Not at all. But I get why its not just an easy fix.
---
I've done everything people say cause it.. ive browsed the atom shop before loading in. Ive stayed logged on while dailies reset and watched them literally disappear and repopulate one by one. I dont have the slightest clue what causes it, because I've yet to have it happen.
---
The onky thing I dont do is play NW. I have a few mods installed, and I dont know. This bug sucks, and I really feel for those affected but man, it seems so random to when it strikes.
---
You sure are a salty asshole. Small wiener? Women don't like you?
---
I almost said "sycophants" in a reply to someone on here but was afraid I'd get in trouble here...
---
Because players shouldn't be banned because of incompetent game developers who use a terms of service as an excuse for how shit of a job they did with this game.
---
I figured it out... the scorchbeast literally walks... on the ground... from a fissure site to the location. I've seen this happen at mire cliff location and the cranberry bog. It's ridiculous to see it trundle across the ground like a cockroach.
---
Plasma rifle with Flamer, melts em like buttah.
---
Mods aren't defined by a singular concept of "new shit".
---
There are plenty of ways Bethesda could let you "mod" a private server that doesn't require unique assets.  Changing the difficulty of enemies?  That's a mod.  Changing enemy spawns?  That's a mod.  Enabling map wide open pvp?   That's a mod.
---
You're the kind of person who saw a SUPER generic promise of "mods" with zero specifics and dreamed up your wildest fantasies of how you modded the shit out of previous games without Bethesda actually promising you anything of the sort.
---
Bloodied is the most popular with commando and heavy as the most common ranged classes and unarmed or two-handed for melee. Junkies is probably number 2 because it gets the closest to bloodied damage, but instigating and quad are also popular, though they are limited to being useful on certain weapons (instigating more so than  quad). Seems like the new gauss shotgun make shotgun builds very viable too
---
Hmm. It must have been a dev room or some other hacker trick. Going to miss that minigun
---
I did it... 6 months ago maybe.  Worked fine no adverse effects
---
Lets see what happens first, you deleting this post or a mod doing it for you before they send the message about your suspension.
---
One of the lunchbox buffs is + carry weight. Something to keep in mind.
---
was this on xbox maybe 8-10 hours ago?
---
Since the last age of the fossil record is any guide. Shame really, they would have been a thing to see. 
---
Oh wait you mean in the game. They’re around but never common. I usually find one doing queen of the hunt.
---
Alright, i'll check there next time they give us this thing.
---
Was it a focused junkie build or were you just using junkie gear?
---
Does the magic effect apply to the shredder barrel attachment on the mini as well...?
---
Can confirm this is a thing I’ve seen in other players camps
---
Lever for main, 10mm and minigun for backup depending on situation
---
Oh my bad lol well gamertag is same as Reddit name
---
Intrested
---
"You poop outta that thing?"
---
Did you play the NW mission first? I had the same thing happen to me and I played and completed that mission before logging into Adventure. Wonder if thats why?
---
Grahm's brahmin.
---
They only said they fixed scorchbeasts turning to ash midair. They didn't say they fixed anything else regarding ash piles.
---
This is the content I crave. Bless you.
---
Marsupial, herd mentality, speed demon, and healing factor are all solid choices
---
I call him Captainnubs. Instead of noobs or newbie I say Nubs.
---
If you start now you’d still be able to get a decent chunk of rewards. Maybe not everything but there’s some good stuff to get at early levels. 
---
Also sorry you were sick and hope you are feeling better now
---
Bloodied or junkies probably are the most common builds
---
But I'd guess most of the playerbase just uses whatever they can get their hands on
---
Marsupial and Healing Factor are always good. Egghead, Herd Mentality, and Empath have become good sellers with seasons and public teams.
---
If I had to choose out of all of them which one would be the best?
---
Lol, glad we sorted that out.  Just fyi, you're going to turn in a LOT of tech data before you ever get a paint plan.  I've turned in hundreds and i've only ever got the first plan once.
---
Ok which one would be the best seller?
---
Those three I think are ones everyone uses.  Personally I think you’ll get more sales with her mentality priced right, considering how easy it is to group now and it has 0 down side.
---
Blame the culprit...
---
Ok I think I will get that
---
Marsupial or adrenal reaction will be your best sellers
---
Marsupial might have the edge as it's usable in every build, and provides one of, if not the best effect of any mutation
---
Yeah. I never even thought that the people labeling them could just be BSing.
---
That's a fair point.  And I get that bugs happen.
---
I just think it's... kinda really sleazy that Bethesda would deliberately engineer this time-sensitive situation to put pressure on players, and then do *nothing* to compensate people who are screwed over when it breaks.
---
I would bet any amount of money that they have the ability to reset the challenges for players effected by this.
---
They could also provide an equivalent value of atoms, since you can buy ranks.  They definitely have the ability to do that, since they've offered to do it in the past.
---
But, of course, they're not going to do either.  They're not going to do anything.
---
Since public teams are a thing, Herd Mentality would be my recommendation.
---
No.  It's apparently fixed in the PTS though, so hopefully when the next update drops on the 4th, it'll be fixed.
---
Nope.
---
As I said, I'm pretty new to this version of the game, it has a pretty steep learning curve, even if (or maybe especially if) you've played all the previous versions.  
---
Knowing that the public workshops are the only PvP options left is an eye opener for me, it explains a lot and answers my question.  
---
Got any pictures of your jetpack park?
---
thats how it is smh
---
If you don’t like the pa build now you probably won’t later. It usually hurts more than helps since you can’t have a backpack or legendary armor effects with it. And if you like range then the armored build would only slow you down. 
---
Doesn’t hurt to try though! At the least I’m sure you can still get the white cosmos armor
---
I played one the night before for the camp challenge.  But nothing today.
---
I had a random person add me as a friend so i found them in the server and they were lvl 7 and im lvl 190 so i go up to them and im being friendly when they hit me so i ignored them but they wouldnt stop so i walked up the road to tyler county dirt track and they had it claimed and since i was so pissed of i hit the claim button then destroyed everything with my AAE minigun and walked off so they got to keep the workshop but then they whined over the chat that they owned that workshop and it was their home so i explained abt the camp system and the workshops and he kept calling me a liar saying since he owned the workshop it is his forever then he kept hitting me so i kept killing him with my VE railway rifle then they said they wanted to 1v1 me (which is how pvp works since the update) and i said sure and i will only use my fists and i asked him where does he want to fight at and he said fortnite then got upset when i said i dont play fortnite or COD which was his next game to fight at so i just kicked him from the party as he spammed me with messages cussing me out.
---
Most players are going bloodied for endgame.  Whatever kills shit easiest for leveling.
---
No.
---
I was just curious.  I doubt the paint would work on my pa anyway.
---
k
---
Outstanding!
---
Happens on PC too sometimes.  It always plays when I get a notification in the top left of the screen.  Not sure what triggers it.  Logging fixes it usually.
---
Where can you find the nuka girl outfit? Is it in a set location or do you have to find the plan and craft it?
---
Nvrm I looked down two posts and found the answer.
---
Well.... how am I supposed to argue with that? 
---
;)
---
No, PlayStation about 2-3 hours
---
Works on T-60 only.
---
This has been like this pretty much since release.  It's a *chance* at a 3\*, not a guarantee.
---
People have been complaining just as long as it's been around, same with the beth logic of *"Well if every supermutant you come across melts you with a minigun, that doesn't mean they'll drop it...somehow."*
---
The giant one is
---
Nope. Nothing in common with any version. Completely separate.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought.
---
Yes. It's been happening to me every other time I enter.
---
Cause they don't want me to nut in my pants.
---
I had to shop around for a while to find someone selling carnivore at a price that wasn't ridiculous.
---
Same. If anything, Id say my unarmed mele build is 5x better than any fixer build. I can reliably solo the queen in less than a minute, and one shot anything else in the game. Bloodied powerfists are where its at.
---
Am I the only one tired of hearing FOMO on here?
---
Dang, I didn't know it would switch back. That's a shame. It does work as a rustic accent, though.
---
B2525 were duped to shit. Everyone and their mother has one now.
---
Yes. The more players at the event, the greater chance you'll get 2.
---
Now you're just talking crazy talk!
---
Okay, thanks a lot. That makes it a lot clearer! Also makes it clear why they get pissed off having to kill an obnoxious low level nuisance as I am over and over again instead of having real enemies to fight. Fair enough.
---
I have well over 3k hours and lost 4 items on 3 different occasions, latest one happening just last week. like you said it yourself, no offense, but you're clearly out of your depth.
---
it's an issue with the netcode and how crappy it is. basically the game desyncs from the server if there's even a hint of lag, resulting in the ui assuming you're doing something that you're not. because this game is all too reliant on the ui.
---
for example, say you open your pipboy to check something and quickly close it. but the game desyncs from the server and thinks you still have it open. then you reload. except the reload key is the same as the drop one, and the game, thinking your pipboy is open, drops whatever is highlighted. because you pressed the drop key.
---
similar things can happen when selling, scrapping, scriping, even stashing. in my case I was quickly going through a bunch of unlearned plans and ended up with a copy of one of them. because the game lost the packet telling to remove said plan from my inventory after I learned it. it was a positive thing in this case, I suppose. but still a case of poor netcode nonetheless.
---
&gt;If you really ‘lost’ an item? Buy it back? Trade for it? Do something besides make a post about you ‘losing’ something.
---
you know what? you're absolutely right. I'll just go to that one vendor in the game who sells legacies or unique fixer rolls that took me thousands of hours to get.
---
oh. **wait**.
---
there isn't one. and you know what else is missing? the tools (or the good F-ing will) so Bethesda can restore items lost due to their own incompetence.
---
Nice
---
Yeah I know, it's pretty neat. I was given one along with a JE25. At least there's still solar/thorn armor to show off a grind
---
/u/undeleteparent
---
Okay, thanks for trying :)
---
I have no idea. I cant even apply the standard lining or anything. It's kind of stupid. I wouldn't of got it had I not known it was gonna be broke.
---
Kill the one shotters at events who laugh about it next pls.
---
It was along the lines of “the sooner you stop playing this trash game the better” or something stupid
---
True true. If theres a will theres a way tho, wont surprise me if someone figures out some exploit or dupe to get those without grinding too lmao. Matter of time I guess.
---
It's a wastelanders bug. You actually ran out of ammo, but it reloads back 1/4-1/2 of your clip before it properly reloads
---
And of course Bethesda Support is all,
---
"Hi, we are aware of this, and may get around to fixing it someday.  We won't compensate you in any way.  We can provide S.C.O.R.E., and/or reset the challenges, but say we can't because checking to see if people are telling the truth sounds hard.  And the whole point of this was to get you to spend real money anyway.  Kindly go away and stop bothering us."
---
"Did this help?"
---
every other day someone loses their gear. and it never seems to get enough traction. don't think it'll ever be fixed at this point, honestly.
---
like I told the other guy,
---
&gt;it's an old, common and under reported bug that Behtesda seemingly can't fix because it's hard to replicate and their netcode is awful.
---
&gt;what happens is that sometimes the game desyncs from the server and thinks you're doing something that you're not.
---
&gt;say you have the pipboy open. then you close it. except the game desyncs and the server misses the packet telling it that you closed the pipboy. now you press reload, which is the same key as drop.
---
&gt;the server, thinking you still have the pipboy open, drops whatever is highlighted. and you'll only notice it once you fast travel or relog, because that's when your character gets saved/refreshed.
---
&gt;this happens all the time in scorched earth. or when the game is being particularly laggy. it can happen when selling, scrapping, scripping. even storing items in your stash.
---
there are ways around it, kinda.
---
They already trade the buillon plan items, but for some reason that method doesn't work for the V94 scout sets
---
Nope big nope
---
Good to see another lever gun using man of culture.
---
Figures, I dislike people who come to games they don't play anymore to just talk shit about it. It's literally the quit having fun meme in living form.
---
"Not right now you don't."
---
There’s no need to write “that is all,” it’s pretty obvious that if the post ended there then that’s it
---
More people need to go to this event for the XP alone.. Yeah, you'll fail with 2 people, but the XP legendaries and loot (not good loot, but lots of junk) are worth it.
---
Gamepass has turned out to be a nightmare of cringy anger children. I just ignore them and move on.
---
Wait you're telling me a company under capitalism is making money off my purchases?
---
FUCK THIS IM UNINSTALLING!
---
Can you breathe underwater in PA or do you need the perk? I used to be able to but nearly drowned the last time I tried, seems Bethesda stealth patched it out unless my game was borked.
---
I’ve noticed it a lot this past week when traveling to my camp. I like it, makes me feel like I’m in Seinfeld
---
Same here.  I feel for you buddy.
---
It's definitely an unintended effect that gives a big boost to players, that would classify as an exploit. As a general rule, don't talk about exploits for a game on that game's official forums, on your official account linked to that game.
---
I think what they warned you about was spreading information about the exploit to the community, which is against terms of service no matter how easily reproducible it is. It's not using or finding an easy exploit that got you, it's spreading it in their forums that got you striked.
---
Praise the melon lord and pass the clown costumes.
---
That's pretty damn good, I dig that laser rifle.
---
Nah, send it! Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!
---
I’d be happy to friend you and share my FO1st server sometime.  I’m an old fart too.  Look for Virile-Octopus on PC.
---
Marsupial and speed demon. Out of those two I'd pick Marsupial because speed demon requires gold and that's not common scrap.
---
Your right and then there is the ones who whine for free stuff then complain so i always put them in their place and i think i made the kid almost cry when i talked trash abt the games he wants me to fight him on.
---
If you click "Buy" a confirmation window pops up asking you if you're sure you want to buy this and in that window you can see the full name of the item.
---
Same.  Feel for you bro.
---
I’ve been playing since wasteland era and I’ve never heard of this event
---
He resets on Saturday’s not mondays
---
Well your question poses that your buying the serum, not the plan, if you are doing that in the hope to sell it I'm sure you won't do that well, with prices of serums at 250 each every day multiple people posting about it, your chance of flipping one is very low.
---
I feel like Bethesda should have the original item with the legendary name and have the 3D item in the middle with modifications on the side
---
Instigating explosive weight reduced, wouldn't be caught without it!
---
That’s the professional way to do it, by the way.  It’s classy.
---
I'm afraid the workshops just aren't going to be good areas for your playstyle, old timer (says the 51 year old).  They are PvP environments that are designed to be contested spots, regardless how the current owner is using the space.  Players aren't being intentionally rude, they are just playing the game as intended for those PvP locations.  Now if they were blasting your camp at a non-workshop location, I'd say you had a case for calling them complete  schmucks, but not in this case here.
---
Your building projects might be best served by hunting around for a bit to find locations that won't be disputed as much.  There are areas around the whole map that are flat, but you might consider staying in the forest area - lower level spawns that are less likely to ruin your builds.
---
Personally I've stuck to building around the Wayward.  It can sometimes take a couple server hops to find a world where my plot isn't taken, but it's quiet.
---
Good luck!
---
At lower levels, better guns are hard to come by. If you can snag a lower level legendary that's phenomenal. 
---
If you can't however. A modded machete or a modded hunting rifle will do you just fine for a good number of levels (just re-craft and mod them as you can use higher leveled versions of them)
---
The better guns and such tend to have ammo that's fairly scarce in the early levels.
---
So, would it be best to leave pacifist mode and fight them, or would they just keep returning to claim the workshop as I have? (I may be a pacifist but I have gathered plans for some serious fire power nonetheless :)
---
The adverse effects you might run into are for legacy game OP where talking about PSP, PS3 and Vita games and PS4/PS5 games should be problem free.
---
Just to piss you off I’m giving my weapons and armor an too many mods
---
A lot of times when you’re dropping/scrapping stuff if you do it too quick it will just pull something from another tab to drop or scrap, sometimes without you even seeing it. Probably what happened
---
TSE GATLING GUN - MY BAE
---
If I was told to choose one only. It would be marsupial. It open more possible options in escaping, climbing, short cuts and combat.
---
They will not do anything, this is the only response you will get:
---
"Greetings,  
---

---
Go ahead and file one anyway.  Create a ticket under the "I have an issue with a challenge" category in the "gameplay" menu.
---
Maybe if enough people bother them they'll actually do something.
---
They come up pretty frequently.  I think last time they were available was a month ago.
---
= (12) for me, I don't wanna accidentally hit it.
---
Found this near Miner's Monument not too long ago
---
I buy on Saturdays, is the buy day different for everybody?
---
Mine is a bloody +10% while aiming that I got during Fasnacht while level 50ish and it's still my main weapon now at level 234. I love that thing but still can't believe I haven't gotten a better one in all this time.
---
He’s terribly irritating to have to deal with.  At least Rocksy sounds completely over it when she sends you to kill yet another former Raider.
---
well, same thing happen in a server early today on xbox. 
---
nuke on fissure prime, few minutes into the event another nuke at fissure site prime in a slightly differente position. we fought the queen and after the event qas over another nuke at prime at yet a different position. left the server before the third nuke hit the ground so, couldnt tell what happened.
---
Unless you want to spend stims then no. Or if you grind out millions and millions of xp for the repeatable
---
I know right? That is all.
---
I already have shielded ss underarmor, spent my atoms on the camo mod from the atomic shop, and it doesn’t even give me the option to apply the camo to my armor. Nothing is there at all
---
[I've got a short little video of the last one I built.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPoHmKZMc-I) 
---
[Another version of it here.](https://i.redd.it/6wxuawx1gx351.png)
---
It's nothing spectacular, mostly it's just the same structure that I blueprinted. I'll toss it down at workshops sometimes just to play around with. I put it at the Berkley Springs workshop once, and that was the most fun I've had with the thing. The workshop got attacked while I was building it by a scorchbeast, so it was destroying my towers as I was trying to fly from tower to tower to fight the thing. It was a heck of a lot of fun.
---
Wow. Lame. For real besides wanting it for the ghillie SS armor, I also wanted a nice under armor for NW. Thought i was getting a deal.
---
Anything but Empath.  I vendor serums, and that one never sells.
---
It doesn’t have to have a discount to be limited time
---
No?
---
Wait, what was his name? I might have done that before
---
Lucky... I can’t even find 1
---
How is it broken?
---
I walked in on Ward sleeping today and SO wanted to plant a grenade in his inventory, which has been a favorite Fallout move of mine for well over a decade now.
---
It wasn't a Christmas or Halloween item so it's not currently in the pool. I'm sure it's only those limited time events that are still dropping.
---
Sounds like someone’s just feeling a bit too entitled
---
Yeah, but as a new player, I desperately need stuff like the neon letters or the 'giant' letters (which aren't so giant anyway) to finish my idea of a build. I'd pay 100% for them is only they were available. Maybe even 104%.
---
This happens all the time, it’s the worst. Often enemies spawn in an unreachable area, like inside a rock or a pipe or under the ground. That happened to me twice today
---
Criminal even....
---
Yes. I'm sure they are intentionally not fixing this bug, that is causing pretty widespread irritation and outrage.... In hopes that you'll spend money. 
---
Because the few dollars a sliver of auto complete victims might pay is the goal. 
---
What a joke. They're not after your dollars with this bug. The dollars they're after with seasons is the people who paid to finish it immediately when the option opened up. 
---
Also, it's hardly criminal for you to be shorted free, digital rewards that they are in no way obligated to give you. 
---
Absurd? Unacceptable? Shoddy? Outrageous? Sure. 
---
Criminal? What a joke.
---
This is why I'm allied with The Crater.
---
Foundation's morals are slippy out.
---
Me too. I'm trying now with no luck.
---
Got to do my own things now bye
---
hahahahahaha
---
I certainly wish I didn't have to burn so much flux if I want to change my jetpack. Not bothering with the new ones they have as score rewards until they change it. Only crafted one on one suit because I never got around to modding my T-65 on one character.
---
I’m glad I’m not the only person with this problem
---
Aight same cya later
---
ESO is backed up by a developing team of over 300 employees. 76 has maybe 30 employees. Those numbers show.
---
Ok
---
"You're the kind of person who saw a SUPER generic promise of "mods" with zero specifics and dreamed up your wildest fantasies of how you modded the shit out of previous games without Bethesda actually promising you anything of the sort."
---
Maybe if they had actually released any mods, mod support, or even clear modding information, you'd have a point. Then you could say hey, look what they did, your expectations were too high. 
---
But they've done nothing. So you're talking out of your ass, and I have no idea why you're babbling about what Bethesda "could" do, when they've done nothing useful at all... which is part of my criticism.
---
Something like that happened this past weekend. 
---
Player nuked fissure prime leaving an area to the southeast as the nuke-free area to fight her. There were 7-10 players fighting her when someone else nuke fissure prime, but covered the aforementioned southeast area.  
---
Queen flew over to fissure prime and stayed there.  She appeared to be taking no damage from the players that tried to  re-engage.  I think everybody just gave up.
---
It just straight up doesn't work at all.  When you kill enemies it's supposed to give you a timed buff to damage.  It simply doesn't give you that buff at all right now.  You can test this by killing something with Adrenaline equipped then checking the status page of your pipboy.
---
The golf area in front of Whitesprings Resort has a large flat area with a water source and the river south-east of Watoga Station comes to mind.
---
Pacifist mode doesn't stop you from taking damage from other players, it stops you from dealing damage to other players so you can't accidentally trigger PVP.
---
It even says so right in the description that you can still be murdered by other players.
---
Edit: It will prevent CAMP destruction though - I did forget you can't destroy CAMPs without flagging PVP.
---
You deserve no compensation for something that breaks because you don't get free rewards they are in no way obligated to provide you. 
---
Would compensation with a fix be good customer service? Sure. 
---
Do they have to? No. 
---
This attitude of "I deserve free stuff, or compensation in the form of premium currency which costs real money, because there was a bug" is a joke.
---
I’m still having an issue with the quest for the camera. I got my camera a while ago, but I still have a quest to investigate Anne/Ansel. When I inspect the corpse, there’s nothing on the body. Therefor I can not complete the quest, and the quest is permanently stuck in my pip boy.
---
It depends if you are buying it to sell to players or robot vendors. Players like marsupial, speed demon, and healing factor. If you are selling it to robot vendors carefully investigate the materials needed to craft the serum. They take different kinds of stable flux (some are more rare than others) and different other materials such as acid,plastic, gold, etc....
---
Yet another week of useless armor skins, that are hidden under the outfit anyway.
---
I wonder, when will they release the Enclave PA for which I already made several paint mods back in april?
---
\*whoosh\*
---
Thanks for the oversimplification though.
---
Saturday is the day. But as OP said here, he bugs out and tells you to comeback next week. Happened 3X to me so far.
---
Okay, thanks, I'll take it off.
---
Why build in the most boring possible location in the setting? 
---
I can promise you, as a person who ran a shop on the beautiful flat Whitespring stream side location....
---
That building in more interesting terrain is much more satisfying.
---
You mean how it looks the looks of a fort clash with the interior being a former Asylum? That's on purpose IIRC the place is based on the real life Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum
---
Easier to mess up an interior than an exterior
---
The upper levels are all neat and orderly, as you would expect of an occupied space
---
From a strategic outlook, you would want to be as deep as possible (highest levels) so you can arrange fall-back positions
---
Shoot with hipfire before you ADS and it will never happen.
---
It took me forever, too.  Probably 2000 hours, and I never skip a Savage Divide event.
---
There is no benefit for completing SCORE challenges after you finish the legendary run
---
I'm in Germany and nowhere near America... But the wasteland weekend is an absolute dream.
---
Nothing you unlock everything and you're weekly and daily Challenges become pointless. Nothing is saved for future runs and they don't revert back to giving you atoms.
---
Far as I've read...nope! Just ends. You no longer unlock anything, get atoms, nothing. It's just over.
---
Yea I figured it out for ward..I still had a quest not complete for him! But Rocksy I still dont understand!
---
I am on Xbox, but I am finding it difficult as well. I went in and cleared out the silo, but it still kept trying to send me to the exit. So frustrating.
---
Thanks, *kid*, says the sixty year old :)  
---
I've learned a lot from your and others' replies. So what is the thihg I should do? Leave pacifist mode, reclaim, and try to blast their head off?
---
For what the knife? Yes
---
Damn it. I'll probably just hop on a team and ask then. I don't think I can do it alone, it's a lot of ghouls right?
---
I don't want free stuff.  I want them to reset the "completed" events, and finish them properly.  Which is an ability I'm pretty sure they have despite protests to the contrary.
---
But if they're going to say they can't do that, then they can provide atoms, which is an ability they confirmed do have.
---
Yeah it’s a skin for the black powder rifle, bowie knife, and lever action. I have 2/3 so it would be useful to me.
---
I think I have seen these bottles somewhere in my hometown. I'll will look for it!
---
If you're actually just wanting to build, check into Fallout 4. It's effectively the same building mechanics as here, except it's not online, and your builds remain in your game. You've got a whole world in which to build settlements that you can populate with characters from within the game. Plus, it's a pretty good story. Also, not sure what system you play on, but you can get mods which will enable to you to have infinite resources so you can build whatever you want within the confines of the games limits that is.
---
Bethesda's official forum is terrible in all ways then Reddit. More toxic members, less knowledgeable, and stops people from talking about obvious bug exploits that they are concerned about.
---
They are worth every cap my friend
---
I've literally gotten the knife paint the last four times in a row.... I thought it was uber common I started trashing it...
---
For sale =/= on sale.
---
Limited time just means it will be for sale for x many days. It does not mean the item has to be discounted.
---
I'd prefer they just extend the season a few days. 
---
I'd rather them take any course of action that doesn't involve giving people unpaid for atoms.
---
And why you pretty sure they have that ability? You aren't. You're just assuming.
---
They are legendarily hard to get if that answers you question
---
Not really, just the drop rate from the machines is terrible. High prices on items is a way some people show items off instead of using a display case
---
So if I just do happen to have 5 of them at 6k caps per that’d be about right?
---
Are you going to be on tonight?
---
Worth buying? Not to me. If your trying to collect stuff maybe but it's only worth alot because it's rare to get one from the machines  like the one inside rusty pick. Otherwise there is one on a rooftop somewhere that you can just pick up almost any time.
---
Yes and no? The machine giving you one is ultra rare. But there is ways one that spawns on top of Westek. Does nothing aside give a small boost to your food meter.
---
The lever action one was an Atom Shop item I believe. Not sure about the black powder rifle though
---
I'm in Germany and it's not that big of a problem here. I actually had some cops asking for a photo at the Frankfurt train station. But I cover it as good as I can so I don't scare anyone.
---
Thanks for the info all.
---
As a joke put em at 30k but if u fr have 5 then I’d go 8-14 k caps
---
Just the knife one drops from that. The other two are Atom Shop skins.
---
Odd question- can you buy modded underarmors off people? I should know the answer to this I've been playing a while and I'm so sick of trying to get the plans. I'm about to supply mats and a tip real talk.
---
I've only gotten shielded BoS, the rest elude me.... Actually I think I got the vault one too....
---
1 hour of grinding and 19 hours of building, exploring with friends, blowing stuff up, etc.
---
This is me minus the friends.
---
I do have 5.
---
I want to make one, but I want to make it out of real trash that I haven't found yet. Especially a cricket bat (I hope it's really called like that) is pretty hard to find on a waste dump.
---
Meh. Of all the interesting camps .... The interesting builds.... People's weapons on display is a big meh.
---
The rifle and the Armour on my right arm is 3d printed.
---
Ok i will and thanks for the tip. Any other tips is appreciated. I been been bumping into you a couple times while playing nuclear winter.
---
It’s a running joke in the fallout community
---
&gt;I'd prefer they just extend the season a few days.
---
I'm pretty sure they have that ability, because it's a really obvious ability for tech support to have, and because they've lied a bunch of times about the technical abilities of their support staff.
---
For instance: They used to say they they couldn't do anything to restore items, but then suddenly they could.
---
I don’t get it though. I have 5 of them and don’t know if they are valuable or I should just eat them.
---
I send them to Foundation, personally.
---
oh which sale was that?
---
that sounds the best so far
---
3d printers aren't that expensive anymore. I've got my ender3 for 150€.
---
SOLD
---
I don't think it is worth even $10
---
I don't know.
---
Then 8-14 k and how do I become as lucky as u
---
No. She can't he hurt by other players. She can even shoot back at other players. Unless she is at a workshop which is a pvp zone, there is no damage in pacifist mode.
---
According to the running joke, yes, yes they are valuable. They’re extremely hard to find so in my opinion keep one in a display case and do whatever to the rest
---
I’ve found it
---
Wow how many people bought this thing? It's a known issue if you hit up the search bar you would see it got reported here almost as soon as the store update went live.
---
Thanks. This is a good post. Very useful too.
---
I use the perk card Aquaboy. It eliminates rad damage and allows underwater breathing.
---
Don’t eat them
---
So how is Bethesda going to separate those who completed them manually, and those who didn't? 
---
Individual player reports? Then they have to verify it .... That's not going to take a boat was load of time or anything.....
---
Also, what about players who spent the time to complete them? You hit a bug and get free atoms while they spent time grinding it out? 
---
Just extend the season.
---
Let’s just say, I search a lot of player vendors.
---
Yeah it's an original character. It's made from old clothes i already had at home. The only things i bought are bleach, glue and 3d printer filament.
---
No, it is what I said which is not months of grind.  Stop shitting out of your ignorant mouth.
---
You can do wastelanders in a few hours then bullion is doing events or some quests.  It's 3250 Bullion.  Not counting Legendary Run you can get 1700 bullion a week so it's less than 2 weeks of regular play.
---
Leader of the pack, I farm it for completing quest, (2 for 1). Legendary kills (3). Use molotovs to wipe out the pack. Easy.
---
Thx for advice. Will try this for next week reset.
---
This is basically the way i felt when they introduced the fridge to the atom shop and didn't put a version in the base game. The feeling that it didn't qualify as just cosmetic and skewed into milking the building focused players.  
---
All this was largely offset by the fact that you could earn atoms from dailies, so builders could work for the items they really wanted but now even that is gone.
---
It’s an event drop only now and incredibly rare
---
yup. he was made for catching buckshot.
---
today
---
Daily, i do it and the two times I messed up, was this. I opened the map too soon and saw that they were counting in the top right as getting completed....
---
The fridge needs to keep food good for AT LEAST as long as lv3 Good With Salt imo
---
Thanks for the reply, you know if it only drops in savage divide or any "Enclave event?"
---
Edit: some wiki I read said it only drops in SD. Sounds suspect to me. :)
---
You can also use the trees to give you visual cover from anyone at a higher elevation like a cliff.
---
it's somewhat unrelated but I feel the game has slowed down quite a bit. a lot less players. even youtubers seem burned out.
---
Gets buggy as hell later on in the quest
---
Why disguise your intention?
---
Why not just title the post with what you actually mean? 
---
"It's super unfair that I don't get as much free premium currency. I deserve it. They owe it to me."
---
Fuuuuck
---
Sad seeing people burnout from the game they love
---
Once you send Aubrie back to foundation, you need to go talk to Paige. Once Paige and Meg have agreed to allow the settlers and raiders to be given the inoculation, report back to the overseer.
---
one spawns on top of west tek.  They are not difficult to get, just need to server hop.  If you have FO1st, you don't even need to hop.
---
I found it a long time ago. I used to go there for a free core. remember it being near a train station.
---
Will you be on tonight?
---
Oh wow that sucks
---
Well.. when we finally stop being stupid about covid and have a vaccine, you would fit right in.
---
Your cosplay is awesome
---
what does "limited time" means? like they dont sell that specific item anymore after that days, ever, after?
---
So does killing friendly Watoga bots and the assaultrons don't fight back if you have made them friendly.
---
&gt;Individual player reports? Then they have to verify it .... That's not going to take a boat was load of time or anything.....
---
Again, I don't want atoms.  I only bring it up because of their ridiculous assertion that they can't edit score values, or reset challenges.
---
You're right, it would be a pain to verify that players are telling the truth, and not just trying to get free score.  Which is the entire reason why they say they can't do that.  They just don't want to.
---
But they can't say that the can't give out atoms, because we know they can do that.  So if that's the argument they want to make... that's where it goes.  I don't want free atoms.  And I don't think they're going to ever part with them (since the whole point of the run is to get people to buy them.)  But Bethesda is lying when they say they can't do anything.  We know they can do something.  We suspect they can do other things too, and if enough people bother them about it, maybe they'll decide to take the least-bad option.
---
I’m pretty sure I bought that for like 10 caps. Is it rare/useful?
---
Go above and west of the black bear at the very bottom of the map and you'll find a lake.  Build on that lake (very flat areas available) or follow the stream up the mountain if you'd rather look for a better view.  There are several spots between it and the spruce knob lake.
---
that's a pretty candid take on what's essentially manipulation.
---
for a game a lot of us paid 60 bucks for.
---
No I believe you’re in the right
---
Its only for Gauss Shotguns.
---
Had the same thing with a level 28. He was hitting me repeatedly with a BSS sledgehammer. I decided I’d hit back with the butt of my gun, forgetting I’m not invincible. I died in one hit. I found that *embarrassing.* Big and mighty level 178 taken down by a little melee dude 150 levels below me. I’m ashamed to say I showed him all my power. I changed out of my Unyielding armor into my ass/sent, purged my rads with Nuka Grape and proceeded to annihilate him with my VE laser. Then the same dude sent me a message: “Now I’m gonna show you why you don’t hit low levels” and came back with a level 932 character. Ass/sent and a BE GP, by the looks of it. That was a pretty even fight. Neither of us could kill the other. Not once.
---
It goes on top of the backpack. That's why the jetpack looks so high and wide.
---
I put one in for 1000+ caps as a joke. I might even have it at 9999. I have the spare sales slot, so I put it in there. If someone's willing to shell out the caps, well, far be it from me to stop them.  
---
They're hard to get to drop from the machine, but they're not unobtainable.
---
👍

 Daily: Someone To Talk To Event One Violent Night Event: Distinguished Guests Event: Guided Meditation Event: The Messenger Event: Uranium Fever

these are the only events /dailies that award those masks now
---
The one in the mire almost always has two.
---
Stand outside the main entrance which is the back and not the front. Notice how the building cascades inwards toward you. Now, go to the front of the building. It has the fountain in front of the door you can't enter. It then cascades back as it should. Go back around to the back and enter. Notice when you go to the left or the right, the interior doesn't line up with the design of the building. It's backwards.
---
Fair enough.
---
You can find one on top of West Tek reliably so no, they're not valuable.
---
We are the tunnel snakes and we rule!
---
Whenever it’s limited time, that means it’s getting taken out of the shop soon. Usually it comes back after a while though.
---
I unlocked that recently too. Couldnt figure it out :/ The planetarium is also buggedz it doesnt seem to project shit
---
Savage divide my friend
---
Oh manipulation?
---
Bethesda said "We're making a game. It's going to cost 60 dollars. If you give us 60 dollars you can have access to the entirety of the core experience and free DLC"
---
We said "Ok. Here's our 60 dollars"
---
Agreement fulfilled. 
---
Never once did they take on an obligation to provide people with free premium currency indefinitely, nor are they bound to not change how it is given, if at all, or how much is given.
---
I wish they'd scrub free atoms entirely just so I can see this sub drown in salty, entitled tears.
---
Actually, I think i just figured out how to make the planetarium work, looks like you have to swal servers. Still stupid.
---
I'd love to see dueling trees, steel plates and the like. Ideally with some sort of ranging feature.
---
Not a jerk. Completely fair and encouraged.
---
To answer your question about “why can’t they remove the limits”
---
https://youtu.be/m37G-06ibAU
---
I play Nuclear Winter every day, sometimes before the reset and sometimes after....still haven't encountered this bug yet. 
---
I've resorted to recording my play session during the reset tho, just in case.
---
Or they could go console exclusive. I'd rather wait for a patch than hear the distinct piercing crying of a PC baby
---
No they aren’t there’s a guaranteed spawn for one
---
They're just going to extend the season. Get over it. 
---
They've extended events in the past. It's going to happen for seasons.
---
They’re literally worthless why tf would anyone pay 8k for an item with a guaranteed spawn
---
I randomly hear it, too.  
---
I also get random Frag Mine beeps and occasionally the Mini Nuke Suicider sound.
---
It very clearly states it’s only for gauss shotguns
---
I always go to Watoga for the robot killing challenge since it's so easy.
---
You can't do Wastelanders in a few hours.
---
What happens if you buy the paint but haven't gotten the shotgun yet?
---
just press ctrl+alt in game to bring up social menu, at the bottom should be a text field to populate, put my gamertag in that box. You might have to click the leftmost tab, I can't recall.
---
I've managed to complete it once in the last five attempts in the past 6 or so months. Either the SB never spawns at all, or it spawns so far away that it never lands, and chasing it results in leaving the event. I'm SHOCKED I was able to complete it even once.
---
I can help you tomorrow, we can both complete the challenge. Same name as my username
---
That’s a real shame. I honestly just want the daily and weekly atom challenges to return...
---
yea it no longer drops from enclave events just savage divide
---
Fair point! But don’t bobble heads only take up like .01 weight these days? I think their weight got basically removed at some points the past year
---
The overseer also cuddles with an imported CHINESE panda in her bed. Just sayin
---
I'm getting nervous about this score stuff. I haven't been able to play the game at all since the season started and will be able to play in a little over a week. Not too worried about catching up unless this kind of thing isn't fixed by then. 
---
Otherwise I haven't been more excited to play this game again.
---
a lot of them don't. they just move on. why do you think Fo76 is... well, Fo76? the fame it's got, I mean. Bethesda took a page, or several, from mobile monetization. and that drove a bunch of people away.
---
the game is somehow still profitable it seems. maybe because those who remain enjoy the game enough to pay to remove the inconveniences Bethesda so conveniently put in place. like the stash box/scrap box.
---
&gt;If I can buy another copy of the game and hold unlimited amount of: Weapons, Aid, etc... Why can't the game just give us unlimited stash space at this point?
---
so you buy another copy. but frankly you can probably hold more than enough stuff with the 5 character slots.
---
Why did I get down voted for asking for help?
---
At least post a reason you pretty lil mole rat
---
That's specific! Source? I've done those events hundreds of times and never received one. Maybe it's just that rare...
---
That's a Bethesda simp for you
---
Simp
---
this, i was one of the first to make a big fuss over how abysmal their budget impact is and it's still not fixed nearly a year later :(
---
I think I subliminally noticed it, but yeah, now that you mention it ... hmmm, possible foreshadowing? Haha
---
To try to give you some spoiler-free insight, the Pint-Sized Slasher is exactly what you think it’d be. Featured in the best part of Fallout 3’s main quest IMO, I highly recommend it.
---
Fine then I just won't buy anything from you. Would you mind giving me your in game name so my ridiculously futile threat isn't quite as futile? It would help my already weakened ego. Thanks in advance!
---
I take their caps and let them on their way.
---
This is really good to know. Thanks!
---
No, definitely not. Things like far harbor or Nuka world added a whole new area to explore, a ton of quests and actual content (not just grinds), hours and hours of questing, tons of new weapons and armor, new settlement objects, new creatures, etc. wastelanders added like 8 hours of quests, 10 if you count the allies and a grind. 6 new weapons, 1 new PA and 1 new armor. And some new skins and a few camp objects. Nothing near an actual paid dlc
---
NEVER *hue hue hue *
---
Or, sit your camp on an acid node and place an extractor.

You are so wrong ,very wrong.1st let me tell you I barely give a !%$@ about the Atom shop.I play for the action,exploring,character customization(perks,stats ect)  not to play "Lets dress Barbie".
---
2nd if you read my comment (Vladimir Ortiz) can you tell me where I mention Atoms? Hell I don't even mention the Legendary Run.
---
3d seems to me that you are a troll.If not then for sure i can see you don't like to read and like make assumption without much data.And finally you are just making yourself look like a fool with such comments.Have a great night.
---
I believe so.  Vats is a bit broken, so it is a bit of a guess for me.  I understand the 50% Crit bonus to be based on the weapons base damage, so it is less than it would seem.
---
Not a trading sub
---
If you're under the effects of psychobuff, a gamma gun won't kill you. Wink wink
---
So, basically not feasible for high action or high player count situations on console. I can barely keep frames consistent on Xbox (playing on a One S) at the best of times; I rolled a Two Shot Gauss Minigun that happens to have bashing damage, so I was curious to see how it performed regarding the whole magic thing. Got it Primed, threw on the Tri Barrel, so (and this was based on precious information I'd read up on) the effective fire rate would sit over 200, counting explosive damage. I don't think I've EVER gotten it to work as Angry Turtle and others have shown off. It would absolutely make sense if frame rate was a deciding factor.
---
I still love using the Minigun as is, though I think I'll keep trying for better rolls overall. Magic stuff is cool, but I'd prefer to get some good rolls in general.
---
We have an even chance of it being either a 1, 2, or 3 star when on a 3*, 33.3% chance each. I think 2* is 66% 2* and 33% 1* with 1* having a 100% 1*. I wish 3* had higher amounts
---
Still available?
---
It doesn’t take “hours” to find creatures. It can easily be done in a single game or two
---
The problem is the players that report to bethesada. Are you rping a fallout cop? Stop simping for a company that routinely fucks it's players and let people play how they want.
---
Yeah add me PSN: Shablagoobuddy
---
I made two separate arguments. the first being that the singular reason why the legendary run is the way it is, is so that you spend 150 bucks instead of being inconvenienced daily for months. that's the very definition of manipulation: create a problem and then sell the solution.
---
and the second was that this is a common tactic in mobile f2p games. but Fo76 is neither. which is not to say that gachas are ok just because they're mobile or "free", but rather that it's particularly egregious in this case because they already got their 60 bucks. plus atoms. plus Fo1st passes.
---
If you’re only level 33 you won’t be able to complete it without grinding millions of xp or paying with atoms
---
The mod itself isn't a legit item. There are legit gilded miniguns though, they have the same paint scheme as lucille's lullaby.
---
Worst case, casual players will get two days worth of scrip and caps a week instead of one.  
---
*Oh no!*  
---
Plus imagine how much better everything would run if there wasn't multiple staggered 20-hour timers for every used character on every account. You'd think a company that is probably best known for it's bugs would try to minimise layers and moving parts..
---
Thats wierd. I mean, when I talk to either of them I get a general response and neither give me a new quest but they already decided to let me help. Thanks!
---
Add me PSN: Shablagoobuddy
---
Considering camp building is the only limited Endgame un this game.. If the servers can handle it, there should be a big expansion focused on it. Maybe a builder NPC arrives in WV.
---
Lol what makes you think they don't test their shit. I can assure you it is all tested
---
Though so. Well that sucks
---
Literally the first time I got enough damage on her to get loot I got a one star pipe revolver.
---
Weapon does 50% more damage, -10% damage per mutation.
---
I know right, surely it's better to have a blanket daily reset for everything than keep a million different 20 hour timers for everything.
---
Junkies ultracite gatling laser
---
Very Rare. Mostly useful for commandos builds.
---
Up to now it feels like doing everything else than using the atomic shop is an exploit
---
Blocker, action boy, moving target, marathoner are the most important IMO, you can put them in any melee build and be effective
---
Yeah,you are right.I may have to change the title so people like you understand what the real topic in the comments is,the hard grinding direction the game is taking with barely any gameplay content.
---
yes it is that rare i have over 4k hours and have done all of these events 100's of times and have got those masks once..but good news is when you trigger it you get both masks bos jumpsuit , white powder jumpsuit and whitespring jumpsuit all at once
---
Well then. I’m lucky
---
You’re right, and the same is true for a lot of interior cells in the game - many of their layouts or appearances don’t match their exteriors. For example there are windows with daylight shining through them inside Vault Tec Ag Center but there are none on the outside where they ‘should’ be. Even the entrance to The Wayward is wonky compared to its interior placement.
---
They need to do another double score weekend and make it a week long

---
why would you go on the internet and tell lies, Todd?
---
I can help you in a couple of minutes, just let me know when you're on so i can accept your add. In game name is hooptyguy by the way
---
Check the hats section?
---
Yes you can buy crafted versions of the shielded armor off other players. Usually in the 1k to 1.5k price range. Depends on the owner
---
Since caps and scrip reset 20 from your first use I developed a routine where my scrip and caps reset 10 apart from each other. This way I can vendor legendaries for room, and then scrip more of them later on. Inventory management is an important part of the game and once you just accept the limits exist it's quite easy to find a system that works.
---
Id say drop blocker to rank 1 and get 2rank bandoleer,  get 3 points in endurance for fireproof it negates sb and sbq's scream attack and any other time run 3 rank chem fiend,  id run at least 8 points in intelligence for gunsmith and traveling pharmacy 15 points in perception sorry i already forgot the rest of your build, add max starched genes I run 3 junkies and in chr I never run what you have in there, ill grab the perk I forget its name but its rank 2 and it boosts the speed that stimpacks work
---
Oh well, I use a TSE gatling so you just point it in the general direction anyway. Won't miss the sights too badly I suppose.
---
I am still on, I will add you.
---
Hahahahaha...
---
Where the plans already there
---
Yeah, hats, helmets, outfits....even went through every armor type just in case they finally started to make helmets more than cosmetic. It just doesn't exist.
---
Thanks so much for the info, at least I know where to look now :)
---
Isnt all sleeping bag variants out there?
---
[BuY mE mOrE jEwElRy!](https://youtu.be/ukqC9HDZHR8?t=2)
---
Seriously, though ... when wearing an SS platebody, half the backpack glitch into it and you can barely see it lol.
---
I’d like a companion that helps you with quests and has his own opinions on how you complete them
---
well it doesn't crash the server by existing if that's what you're getting at
---
But then it leaves partial cores with those amounts?
---
How can people hate him? He congratulates you and gives you a prize :(
---
I scare them back to Crater or send them to Foundation.
---
There from thingiverse. But I had to Re make some of the parts of the rifle because the thingiverse file didn't fit properly.
---
Hey I didn't say it would work properly. I said everything is tested.
---
Ok. That's actually got some good points in it.
---
It should be in helmets since that’s where the atom shop version is, so it’s definitely a bug
---
Your comment relate to the topic very well cause maybe is slowing cause people are getting burned with the insane grinding and no real content.
---
Pipe is life
---
Or not. I don't mind having this event all too myself for the xp, especially when I'm on a full Intelligence/ building team with randos and they don't even bother coming.
---
The broken RR door was a mistake. Someone fucked up and mistook the unreleased one for the RR garage for the old one.
---
Can we get more stuff like the pipe in a new update? Let's turn this wasteland wild.
---
An addition, the messenger event has a chance at the rare reward no matter where it spawns.
---
Incisor and martial artist are good ones. If you plan on doing a bloodied build radicool is a must. (Heck even if you're not doing that it's good unless you absolutely hate radiation). 
---
For melee builds a great mutation is twisted muscles.
---
Bro it literally says in game that other players can still harm you, it just negates your damage to players unless you're in a pvp area such as a workshop, so you don't accidently start pvp with someone.
---
I am so disappointed there's a pie out there on a rooftop.
---
Okay, thanks. Bug reported then.
---
Interesting. I applaud the dedication. Good luck with it!
---
Its hard even with fallout 1st.
---
What I do. Get on sell aid items and sell 1400 caps worth. Scrip 150 with of legendary items. I sell all ammo for 1 cap each or convert crap ammo to 5.56 to sell. I sell all crap legendaries for a few cap each selling the heaviest items first. Aid items i sell for 1 to 2 caps each and plans also get sold for 1 to 5 caps each. If im nearing max caps i go buy plans i don't have even if i won't ever use them.
---
Walking cane and syringer
---
what's your in game name?
---
They cannot hurt you if you are in pacifist mode. Trust me on this. You can even hit them back and nothing will happen. Unless you are at a public workshop.
---
this is actually the event i got mine from
---
I could list off tips for days but you might already know most of it. Is there anything else specific you want to know?
---
I end up having too many legendaries so I sell everything I wont use for under 100 caps each.
---
I have a vendor with huge *CHEAP LEGENDARY* letters on it.
---
Once I have bought every plan possible I'll just leave the bad legendary drops.
---
I rock a 1 star bloodied pipe rifle with a hardened receiver as a bloody stealth rifleman,....melts anything from lvl 50 scortchbeast and down. At the cost of .38 ammo to boot. Great fire rate. Can go through a whole clip in vats and im still above half my ap.
---
I need to add you as well, it's not showing your name up in my friends list
---
the list i posted is mostly accurates except you can now get western outfits from claim tickets as well
---
I gotta try that then thnx
---
shhhh
---
damn synths
---
I got a junkies hand made today, the other 2 were VATS perks if you're interested.
---
Crusnik02 is in game name
---
Heck yeah, I know what I'm looking for tomorrow.  Give me my Mr. Fuzzy bundles!
---
Do you own the original Captain Cosmos outfit from the atom shop? I think the helm comes with that, but not the recolors
---
What makes it even better is it cost me like 150 aluminum to fix all the trash
---
Is your camp near where people usually drop nukes?
---
Bloody Mess, but that's awesome for all builds.
---
If you would miss a day with a global reset, your going to miss a day with a personal reset to.
---
robots! Lots and lots and lots of robots. I know your post is old, but did you ever manage to get a team together for it?

It’s near white springs but it’s far enough away that anyone nuking should have to go out of their way to hit it and I didint see any pop up about a nuke
---
That thing is the g.o.a.t
---
You can't use it.

Dude, we've already established you can't harm people in pacifist mode. IT'S WHAT IT'S FOR. However, the game states and I quote "In Pacifist mode, you can't hurt other players and are choosing not to participate in PvP (Player versus Player). Other players can still murder you. Which means they can still damage you, it may not seem like a lot or any at all because shooting someone first and if they don't shoot back is like using a marshmello gun on a nuclear bunker. My friend has been murdered even with pacifist mode on and she asked me the same thing which I told her the same we are telling you. The damage is absolutely miniscule but if someone has the time and ammo it can be done.
---
Radicool, Solar Powered, Motion assist servos  will total +10 strength, or +50% damage if you have them all. Also get Party boy rank 2 and a disgusting amount of whiskey and psychobuff and go in a rampage throughout watoga. My calculations with all of these together is +110% melee damage with all of these active at once. Plus talons, herd mentality, and iron fist, it should be dealing at least 250% Damage per strike(assuming 15 strength base), resulting in 750% damage per strike assuming every hit is a sneak attack. Melee is disgustingly powerful that way. You don’t even really have a weapon and you can one tap a sentry bot with your fists.
---
Luckily I got it once about 2 weeks ago not since
---
Oh for fucks sake. Are you on Xbox?
---
I had around 3 one time, it was odd
---
Reading your title reminds me of the movie Full Metal Jacket.
---
My fav thing, made me design my whole build around it.
---
Yes I am, I literally logged on to give you the direct quote. I'm no longer continuing this conversation, especially if you're just going to spread misinformation about the game.
---
They know these things are happening, they’re releasing them anyway.
---
The worst glitch is the mole rats... they require a Crit with a two shot mirv launcher to get anywhere near hitting it
---
It's not just that they don't test patches. It's that they have a PTS and getting trapped in PA didn't get fixed before they released the patch. You think someone might have noticed.
---
You can literally report bugs forever in the tickets and they never get fixed. Often public discussion is the only way to get things addressed, and even then it often barely works.
---
Also if there is a problem with the game and people find it/use it WHY DONT YOU FIX IT? 
---
"Hey we found a cool item interaction in game that boosts our special stats above max, that's so cool I'm glad Bethesda designed this!"
---
"EXPLOIT AND BANNED"
---
"What?? Why didn't you just patch it if you didn't like us using it?"
---
"BANNED BAITING AND TROLLING"
---
Finally somewhere to store my cranberry relish and ingredients. Do you know if you can lock it?
---
So how about you join me in a public game and see if you can kill me, or destroy my camp. I will even shoot you back
---
Camp stuff will not turn into flux plants.
---
LOL, you have GOT to be kidding???!?!!   What, 9 months of rampant fucking duping, bloodied everything, one shot everything, people paying their fucking RENT selling ill-gotten dupes in open markets.....and THIS is how they're going to "get it under control"???
---
Fucks SAKE man, crack a fucking book Bethesda, that is NOT an exploit.   How about you deal with ACTUAL EXPLOITS and quit fucking with legit players.
---
Just remembered why I fucking hate Beth again....
---
I read this as naked red zone and it was a much better sentence
---
but no I'm pretty sure the corn has to be there beforehand
---
Had a lv 210 holding the acid workshop but not using it. So I claim and build it up. He comes in taps me. So I light him up with a magic shotgun. He melts into paste. Come back and figures out my build enough to rekt me over and over. Each time respawning. He's getting chewed up by my turret placement. So I dont get to pop the shotguns x2 damage on full hp mod. 
---
10 minutes of counter harassment, mind you I've already built up the location, and he starts dropping jukes. Ok. 
---
So i have a anti building build and more mini nukes then I know what to do with. He left the server 5th shot in. I was dropping them into the middle of his house. Guy left the door open. Lol. Was fun.
---
I went to take a look and you're not kidding. I wasn't expecting it to be so small. I got a picture of it with the two toy aliens. One of my favorite little easter eggs yet.

---
I 100% agree I emptied a lot of ammo into the SBQ today and got a 1* spear.   At level 201 WTF am I going to do with that?   At least if it was 3* it would be worth some script.
---
All of it is overpriced now that we hardly earn atoms
---
I mean OUTSIDE power armor. Like a real martial artist. You get the chance to use both fists, also. 
---
I can clean WesTek using my bare hands. Like a man. Like Batman. 
---
All unarmed perks + mutations + unyielding armor.
---
FYI people don't have multiple copies of the game, you can create multiple characters per profile.....
---
It isn't a "problem" as long as scrubs keep throwing their money into this dumpster to keep the fire a burnin' 😉
---
I want a lamp and stash box skin, maybe a Fuzzy trucker hat.  All I really want is to display my the jumbos and for them to add the rest of the pencils, etc.
---
I’ve had zero success moving bases. It’s Beth. It’s not you. Hopefully someone can help here.
---
Get good...at RNG? How does one *get good* at RNG?
---
Hey, that was harsh, but true.  I really feel like this is the kind of Feedback Bethesda needs, and should take to heart.
---
Surprisingly polite too, actually.  I'm with you in your analysis.  Honestly, while there are many positive aspects of Fallout 76, the monetization and game engine and technology behind it aren't part of them, along with the lack of feedback and fixes and polish.
---
I'm currently working on finishing the "Siding with Crater" vault raid, and then I'm done with this game, honestly.  Might dabble with the dailies to finish Legendary Run "just because", but I'm done with my Fallout 1st sub, and I'm one foot out the door in general.
---
No it has to be there first. Getting nuked will also level your camp and destroy all your crops
---
It's been confirmed that it's a bug in that the helmet was to come with the outfits, fix is in the pipe.
---
Not last time you sold something, it's the first time....
---
oh.. so i pretty much just lost my whole base?
---
I was getting ready for bed, due to the fact I have work tomorrow. You shooting me back will do nothing regardless, as is the nature of pacifist mode, and I'm not wasting time nor resources to shoot you or your camp. I'm going to bed, as was my original intent up until you started reinforcing your false information that someone corrected you about and for some reason you're still adamant about. So have a pleasant night, or whichever time of day it is for you, and perhaps we'll see each other in the wasteland.
---
Being out of pacifist just while within a workshop works really well. The only issue that might arise is many people try hard to make OP builds for combat. So if you do, maybe pick up home defence 3 and contractor 2 so you can place some missile turrets (or something similar) in your shop to scare off would-be invaders.
---
Find a flat place (if you built a flat surface house) and place it. Once you do that go ahead and create a blueprint and then go back to the place you wanted to move originally and construct the camp off the blueprints
---
Move it around while spamming the place button. Even if it doesn't turn green, sometimes it just realizes that it should be placing and it places
---
No poodle skirt again :(

There was a sleeping bag bundle for twitch prime members last year.

Whether it's a bug or a feature, it appears you have to buy from him on the same day every week. Miss that day? You don't get it that week and have to wait until the 'reset' day again.
---
S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky intensifies
---
Scorch bitches will attack your camp homie
---
Another example of something 100% of the community agrees with, but has quit posting about because Bethesda doesn't give a shit.  So we stop trying.
---
my whole house is a blueprint, and I am using a flat place. However, it just won’t place anywhere...
---
Sorry. But yes. It’s happened to me a couple of times. But maybe someone knows something different.
---
Yup
---
You cannot hurt, nor be hurt, and your camp cannot be damaged nor can you damage  other players camps while in pacifist mode. The only places where PvP can take place is at public workshops and Nuclear Winter.
---
On a side note, now it won’t let me scrap the structure I made to place it on
---
ugh
---
any idea as to why...?
---
Thanks for clarifying!
---
Boom! Send your checks to 2+Tough, Bethesda 🤣🤣
---
Can you imagine being the development manager of this game....
---
Nothing must phase that person any more.
---
I'm not sure it was an older age player unless there was another one. One gentleman was stuck at home out of work due to serious injury and had nothing better to do with their time than play all day every day. They developed huge maps and routes for resource farming, and shared it on this subreddit. They were even directly thanked by some of the Bethesda staff that post here.
---
A few days after being thanked, by Bethesda directly, for their community contributions here on reddit, they were banned by an automatic flag while moving huge amounts of resources between their secondary account and primary account.
---
I have an explosive shotgun. I'm a Vats build. Hillarity ensues. I only use it on assholes.
---
It is a great gun for a VATS gunslinger. You can definitely kill most enemies in the game for it.
---
I would keep it as a "tagger" for events like Uranium Fever or for easy kills like Manhunt or Campfire Tales. The explosion can affect a big area and ammo is easy to find. 
---
Just so you know, my cowboy can oneshoot most enemies. The SA is a beautiful revolver. It's a weapon for gentlemen.
---
I’d suggest designing builds around the most terrible weapons in the game (throwing knives, walking cane, etc), and not optimizing at all for the weapons to become effective. It makes the game feel completely different. I recently tried a run where I have to beat the original story (SBQ included) with nothing but a non modded, non legendary pipe wrench. It changes the game completely, and also helps you learn new strategies against common enemies
---
Him and insult bot show up in the middle of line in the sand.  Never was surprised and sad so fast.  Prize bit showed up right as it started so killed him.  Then about three enemies left a bot just comes walking into the battlefield insults me and leaves.  My party were laughing at how stupid it was.
---
Maybe ur SB is killed halfway becoz it is a legendary XD
---
What’s that? Whenever you leave your camp and come back the door is shut but says it’s “open”
---
It worked!
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
The title tried to warn you
---
Oh really?
---
I like my Ultracite gatling laser myself, but I'll take your word for it
---
I saw that, but Mr. Fuzzy wasn't part of it according to the wiki.

The fact this still happens if fuck!ng disgraceful

The best bet is to buy Saturday evening EST after he resets but before the weekly game reset at 1200 EST Tuesday.
---
Moving bases never works 98% of the time.
---
Nice! It looks amazing
---
I need more camp budget and more stash storage space
---
The one on the garage prefab or the non place-able one?
---
Honestly, it’s good to start from the ground up often. It’s the only way to start figuring out all the ins and outs of building to avoid accidents in the future. Just see the move as building on the skills you learned since you’ve built your last camp and look forward to the improvements
---
Gamer tag is ClickedAgenda91
---
I’ve got a solid group of lads I’m able to consistently play with, you’re welcome to join in if you want. Nobody’s sweaty about the game and we’re really just messing around, like going to the glasses caverns at level 5 and dumb stuff like that
---
That's literally a scam ads.
---
Thank you so much.  I appreciate the help.
---
Thats Bethesda :/  
---
no fun and working stuff w/ o modders.
---
45 percent makes the queen’s melee feel like its trying to tickle you
---
Happened to me today. Started up the game, selected Adventure mode, game crashed, restarted an on loading in both my weeklies and dailies were auto-completed. Lost out on 8500 score. Had to spend 600 Atoms to move the four spaces on the board I'd be behind because of this. Wrote a support ticket requesting my Atoms back but not expecting anything to be done about it. I say this game is coded by monkeys
---
Thats a good picture. Mine is all merky looking
---
Naw. There’s no rule against killing any enemy.
---
Yeah Isn’t scrochbeast sonic blasts semi-explosive? So Fire Prof works with that? I say that because I seem to take less from the blasts then I did when I didn’t have Fire Proof.
---
That was mildly intentional
---
Not yet no!
---
No thanks, I have a disgusting amount of max level junkie guns because I do this weird thing where I wait until level 50 to spend all my scrip, and I end up with around 900 per character. On the third character now, it’s almost time for more leggys.
---
I'm honestly not sure. Was it part of the other superheros pack?
---
What gets me is how items last longer in a portable frig backpack, than they do in your camp refrigerator.
---
Yep. It’s explosive as it detonated similar to a gauss Minigun or Molotov, so it gets defined the same way
---
No caps needed, just glad to help
---
Any news what perks they broke instead ? Cant believe they would get something fixed without breaking something else lol
---
The red rocket door for the garage prefab
---
Is it also energy damage as in based on your ER? I’ve heard mixed reports on that
---
Same thing here.
---
Getting harder and harder to justify playing when literally anything can break at any time and the players are just SOL.
---
Sigh. Maybe Shadowlands will be good. At least Blizzard actually has a good control over glitches.
---
I don't think that's their reasoning for it, though. It probably wouldn't change things at all. It's just the easiest thing for people to blame. I know about costs and it taking time for consoles, but that isn't always the actual reason. Destiny 2 is removing content from their game because the devs said the game is becoming too big and difficult for them to patch. So people were defending it blaming it on consoles and a patch limit that doesn't exist. Unless it is stated by someone who works for/with them and is an officially stated reason, then I wouldn't blame it on consoles. There isn't any form of crossplay so they could patch PC whenever they want. They just don't. The only thing stopping them is themselves.
---
It could be broken now.  I only used it on my bloodied PA build and I haven’t played that character in a while.  Or maybe it never did and I just didn’t notice.  Still like the sound though.
---
I agree. Price is too high. I removed my bobblehead stand months ago because, fully loaded, it takes up a big chunk of camp budget.
---
What about the SS underarmor? What does it break?
---
I’d assume it is, since it would be weird for a sound wave coming from a giant mutated coronavirus dragon to do the same damage type as a .50 BMG round
---
The biggest thing for me is how poor the collision is in the atom store items. I got the Red Rocket garage and I tried to place some lights on the outside front wall, they were all floating about a rulers length away from the wall because Bethesda seems to be slapping an auto collision on everything without testing it. With the steel bungalow as well you can't even place items next to the windows or they'll glitch through the ceiling and be placed on the roof
---
Or the Chad acid camper.
---
There are plenty of great locations to camp at that don't have any resources at all. I'm currently camped on a bridge across a small gorge and the only resource I have is water.
---
True but with Bethesda you never know.
---
I have all of those except for herd mentality. What does it do?
---
I'm hoping with instanced CAMPs that I'll be able to make a bunker 
---
That's all I want. I rarely buy stuff for the CAMP, and mostly everything I've gotten is earned or from bundles (IE free states bundles). I'd just like to customize a cozy, militaristic bunker for my Enclave General
---
Insecuregoose, add me I’ll be on in 10 mins or so
---
What platform?
---
One time I had Grahm show up at the start of Line in the Sand and since he's essential and can't die he just stayed and fought during the entire event lol.
---
25% more xp gain for an hour baby! Yeah!
---
I just play the game. I wander around gathering garbage. I go around picking on low level mobs. I go around picking on high level mobs. I build and rebuild my camp until everything is perfect then I tear it all down and start over. I do whatever happens to catch my attention at any given time and not once have I rushed to make sure I hit that daily limit on caps or scrip or bullion. THAT is how I enjoy the game.
---
I’ve been too busy getting junkies pipe pistols from the purveyor.
---
One of my favorite events. I have never had a problem. Fly Swatter on the other hand only spawns for me about 50% of the time.
---
Is there any follow up to this story?
---
Use the ground based water purifiers and you can plop down anywhere. 3 or 4 should be more than you will ever need.
---
Yeah. Go to bed. You cannot kill me when I'm in pacifist mode unless I am at a public workshop. PERIOD.
---
Eyyyy, glad to see Beth finally implemented NPC companions into the game! /s
---
What I need is a floor with space decor like the wallpapers from the season pass. I can't create a perfect space camp when my floor is wood or concrete lol. Also I want to place wallpapers at roofs. +A bit more budget would be nice
---
Bloodied smj, nerd rage, bloodied mess, commando perks, and adrenal reaction mutation.
---
Buggy camp building mechanics, if your blueprint is on top of that structure you will likely be stuck with it as you can’t delete it if there’s structure on top of it. And when you move camps that bottom part will now be part of your camp blueprint.
---

---
Use a Vampire’s bone hammer and you’ll never have to worry about anything but collecting bone shards occasionally ever again. It’s disgusting what you can do with a bone hammer. Most fun weapon in the game
---
That’s a really great tip! Thank you!
---
I was going to totally redo my camp anyway (a friend threw it together in like 2 minutes), but I wanted everything from the inside. 
---
On a side note, I made a little platform to try to place the house on, and now I can’t break it (it says part of structure it not accessible). Any idea why? Idk what to google to figure it out that’s why I’m asking lol
---
no.
---
&gt; “Now I’m gonna show you why you don’t hit low levels”
---
He says after instigating the original fight with you. The fuck did he think would happen?
---
Okay I'm doing something right now, if I'm on later I'll add you and we'll team up if you're still on
---
I don’t know. Either way he was deluded and using a superior weapon to me and still couldn’t kill me when he jumped on his level 932 main.
---
Oh i see and no worries. Thanks for the first tip. The bug hasn't occurred ever since
---
You mean that's not how doors work?
---
let’s you listen to his answers in his questline and what the npc is saying
---
You speak madness. Placing your camp on anywhere other than a free constant source of one of if not the most important junk item in the game is a waste akin to eating an Oreo without the creamy filling and I for one sir will not cast my pearls before swine. Good day!
---
I did the same thing, I bought that new fridge in the atom shop today before hitting play, and when I clicked play, I found that basically all of my daily and weekly challenges were completed. Just lost roughly 8000+ score. WTF
---
It isn’t actually connected to my house, it didn’t work out. It’s a foundation with a staircase on it connected to another foundation.
---
That’s... seriously? All I can say is that’s some terrible forum management.
---
Also, if this is a ‘exploit’ (bug or unintended programming is likely the better term - you aren’t abusing something like a dupe glitch here, you’re simply equipping an item), I have to question how this even happened on the coding side. The old firework grenades from Meat Week never did this, so how can something with  nothing more than a different particle effect even have this drastic of an effect without someone deliberately making a change.
---
Didn’t catch the name. This was yesterday. Also - How?
---
Pipe is beet life
---
More budget would be nice. I make a small little shack and nearly the whole budget it blown then I walk a few paces and see this person with a modern paradise packed with stuff and just feel sad.
---
What do you mean by "listen to his answers"?
---
It does.. I got one the other day o.o
---
I feel sorry for Ward. He seems to spend most of the time in bed and if he's up hes hiding away in his office. Rarely is he walking outside or interacting with others. Clearly he is going through some kind of depression. Maybe from being in charge of supplies and not being able to stop them being stolen constantly.
---
Congrats my dud
---
you can see what responses he chooses to select in his quest line
---
Oh, I see, thanks!

I’m gonna answer anyways. Sneak, Escape Artist, Gun Fu, Commando (all), Tormentor, covert operative. Combo those with unyielding armor and you’re permanently Invisible

Go to all the silos, prepare to cry

thx so much

Np
---
Nah, it’s easier to fuck with us when we find a way to benefit from their oversights.
---
I already lost this faith when they added the Hazmat Plan and no one could craft it..
---
Just claim workshops
---
I use the ones that make a pew, pew sound!
---
It’s very frustrating for lever action rifles as well. I tend to know roughly how many shots the enemy I’m fighting needs to go down, and if it’s more than 5-6, this bug can prevent me from having an accurate number.
---
**"For instance. If I only manage to get  on at 10pm at night to play, that means the vendors wont reset until  after 6pm the following day.**
---
**This means if I can play early the next day and not in the evening I can't get my daily caps and I can't get my daily scrips."**
---
Vendors reset at 8pm.  In this example you're asking for vendors to reset at 8pm rather than 6pm, in other words 2 hours later.
---
No, 20 hours is better than 24.
---
The only benefit to resetting with dailies is that you then don't have to remember.
---
For some of us, like me, I have my bullion, caps and scrip all at the same time and I do it every 20 hours meaning I get it 8 times per week rather than 7.
---
There's a few spots with things under water, Inc but not limited too; safes to crack, skeletons with a visual story how they passed, hints towards actions of certain factions.
---
Vault I think
---
A test server "fix" isn't a released fix now is it.  Try again.
---
And the DLCs they force you to pay for at the end can be a nightmare.
---
I want to build Caesar's tent from New Vegas, but tents aren't wide enough. There's also not a variant with two doorways.

Lmfao
---
Dawg, your math is off. 12\*60 is not 72, it's **720**.
---
Ten minutes would be 120 acid, which is better than how you've described the fast travel bonanza (along with saving the caps).
---
Easy Answers
---
- Get Scrapper in order to learn weapon mods
---
-Claim Workshops for plans
---
-Go to train stations to sell stuff
---
-Never spend money at NPC Vendors unless you need to 
---
- Never sell weapons, always scrap them
---
- Play the main storyline for the coolest stuff (Base game stuff, not the foundation thing)
---
See it with my handmade sometimes but not others.  It's pretty awful when it decides to only fire 7 shots before reloading considering it takes longer to reload than fire 7 shots.
---
Also get stupid "not the right ammo type" errors for my handmade, which is wonderful when you try to fire it at the monster that is right on top of you as you spawn and the gun just doesn't work.
---
I'm regretting not grabbing the Sheepsqautch plusie when it was available having recently learned how to put stuff in my empty display case with them.

Love grahm.  He has helped defend workshops before.  Haven't seen him in a while though.
---
Do console players not get a hotkey wheel like PC does?
---
2int on protected and sheilded vault. 3int on shielded casual. 1int on pro casual.
---
While most berserker builds rely on broken pieces of various unyielding, cavalier, and/ or sentinel armor,  greased up naked deaf guy will be running the wasteland in straight up skivvies. This means most of his perk loadout will be in damage reduction/ avoidance, and ap refresh, not leaving much room for weapon optimization.
---
From what I could figure out it has something to do with blueprinting it from the converted ammunition factory, but I haven’t found out how that happens because you can’t do it the normal way
---
Shielded casual under armor with +3 int.
---
Edit - Are you after some? If your on xbox i can make you one.
---
Lmao I've camped on them all man. My favorite is the junk node north of Watoga with the DC spawn, I haven't hurt for gears all year. I've also camped right in front of West Tek with a turret wall, legendaries for days.
---
Consoles don't have a literal "patch limit" but they DO have innate storage limits based on their stock hard drives.
---
It's not the best example but a while back Warframe had to tell it's Switch players that they officially needed to get a storage expansion to continue playing the game because it was officially too large to fit on the systems internal storage.  
---
For a game like Destiny 2 if we look at the PS4 a quick googling with results from late 2019 has the game reaching at least 165gb, that's something like four times the size of your average PS4 game and almost a third of the standard 500gb hard drive for the system all dedicated to a single game.
---
Optimization is illegal. Play a melee build with high charisma perception and intelligence. No other way to go
---
Isn’t it a prize in the legendary run now too?
---
Whining that Bethesda needs to fix something that's already fixed and is just waiting to come out with the next patch doesn't make much sense now does it.
---
Yes it is, it's a camp plan too so you can build your own little set up in the world for people to find.
---
At some point if the abused person never actually leaves, you cannot leave them entirely blameless for the abuse they take.  It doesn't excuse it or make it anymore acceptable, but if this game makes you angry or disappointed then maybe don't play it.  But seriously its like people have some clause in their DNA that they are forced to play whatever Fallout game is out and if its not fun then they are going to make damn sure everyone knows how tortured they are.
---
For me it seems that he resets Saturday at 8pm est, but I have to buy before tuesday at noon est.
---
NW did cause daily atom challenges to not work, it was a well known bug they never bothered fixing. So not surprising it was the first culprit for these challenges.
---
I don't even have faith they'll bother to fix the Legendary Run challenges even if they figure out what is causing it.
---
I just work with the limitations, Exploring with other players is the draw that keeps me around.
---
(You can bulk junk items to make them weigh less)
---
Half vertical walls, triangle foundations and the like, and my personal favorite, a fence foundation or wall foundation which has an 8 way connection point

As someone from Cleveland I can confirm the Cleveland Browns were at Chili's. All of the Chili's.

I’ll trade anything I’ve got for anything I want. I’ve got some really good drops from this game, and I’ve also got piles of the same duped shit everyone else has. Just treat it like anything else and base the value on rarity. If you have something great that wasn't duped, make the dude with the duped shit pay up for it. Personally, I’ll pay/trade far more than something is worth if it’s something I need. There’s a dude out there right now walking around in an unyielding/sneak/ap scout set because he set me up with the junk and aid I needed to get a new character rolling. I’m sure he duped all of it, and I’m about 90% sure that set was duped by someone else before I got it. He got what he wanted and I got what I wanted, that’s as far as I care to look into it. 
---
The way this game is with the economy and the constant exploits, I don’t feel bad about any of it at this point. I used to, but I eventually came to realize just how shitty the RNG actually is, and how you can still be rocking bullshit after 2000 hours because the drops are that terrible. My playtime is for me to enjoy, and the grind isn’t enjoyable anymore. I’d rather trade for what I want when the opportunity presents itself vs. hoping I’ll somehow find what I’m looking for after farming 76000 legendaries. People bitch about prices, bitch about duping, and then bitch about nobody wanting to trade. You guys gotta pick one and stick with it, especially since one of those issues corrects the other two. The market being flooded and the cash sales being destroyed are two things this game really needs to make it more enjoyable for newer players. These guys don’t stand a chance of getting decent gear right now, it’s sad.
---
I am yeah, but this subreddit doesn't allow trading as a post- though im on PC
---
I log off the game. I would play it even more if there weren't so many limits. Like why not let us buy more vault steel without server hopping? Why can we only scrip 150 points worth of legendaries? Why only 200 of Treasury notes? Why cap out our bullion and scrip? When I hit my limit for day I stop playing.
---
Whoever gave that number was highly inaccurate. Before I deleted mine it was at 108 or 109 gigs I believe. This was maybe a month ago. And to be fair, the devs never stated storage limits being a reason. They said that with all of the game layers upon game layers the game was getting too difficult to patch die to the size. Somehow people translated this to patch limits imposed by Sony and Microsoft and saying that it was because of consoles when that wasn't stated. People like to blame consoles whenever they can for things.
---
I could see Beth eventually making fridge a free droppable for some event or the other, and Atom stuff being skins for fridge, with quest line similar to Pioneer backpack where you do stuff for additional fridge bonuses.
---
Would love to see ice cold nuka making fridge, 90% food slower decay fridge, big fridge for double the items; honestly wouldn't be surprised if we see this since it follows same rough model as collectron and backpacks.
---
When I hit weight limits because I can't sell anything more I log out until the vendors reset so I can sell crap.
---
You don't need multiple copies to have multiple characters you can have 4 with 1 copy.  It helps a lot less than you'd think though.
---
You can have five characters on one account, you don’t need multiple copies. I’ve got one playable, and four loaded down with caps and the stuff I use most often. Anything I get that isn’t valuable, isn’t rare, and can’t be used gets dropped. I don’t save scrip, don’t stock vending machines, and don’t hoard anything I don’t absolutely have to have. I’d rather have a mule packed full of aid and junk than anything else. Most legendaries are worthless and should be the first things you drop if space is an issue.
---
I have mine set up filled with sheepsquatch plushies sitting in a circle around a nuka cola lamp. 
---
It's a nice pre fab
---
What? It took me like a two weeks to get the jetpack, and that was with smiley glitched and not selling me gold.
---
Just buy the chest plan and the jetpack mod plan first after the vault heist, no reputation is required.  None of the other rewards are nearly as fun as the jetpack by a loooong shot.
---
You should use concentrated fire for vats, one rank is all you need to target heads, also look into gun fu (also one point). and more points in adrenaline.  I would drop light footed and escape artist altogether.  Also I recommend having 3 minimum but five preferred points in intelligence so you can make top rank mods.
---
Yeah, as much as I love the game, the dev cycle for 76 is shoddy as fuck. Minimal if any unit or integration testing
---
Yeah, all the Watoga roofs require elevators. Not sure if they'll add load screens in NW
---
You can get the signs and letters plan in game for near 10k caps. Pretty much neon or light-up letters
---
I had the exact same thing while doing the challenge.
---
If you place a floor at the top of the ladder, add a ladder back down until you can place a connection foundation.
---
Then I was able to delete from the old foundation to the new one.
---
Hope that works for you.
---
It was between 25th june and 9th july. Summer discount ı think. But ı think ıt was on pc platform. which platform do u use
---
That’s my thing, they apparently want us to grind, but they set limits on everything so we can’t grind. If I want to play for 6 hours and cash in 4000 scrip, let me. If I want to spend an entire weekend knocking out events to get bullion for a secret service set, let me. There’s no point in punishing people who want to put in work to get what they want quickly. You can play for 10 minutes or 12 hours a day and you’ll still arrive at certain rewards at the same time, it’s dumb.
---
I like the crosshairs better anyways.
---
I did exactly the same yesterday - along with the other bits of Scorched in jars - and they displayed fine. Probably just a crappy coincidence, but no way to be certain. Restart the game and try again, those items spawn reliably in the same place.
---
It's not much better here, they'll mass downvote anything that is remotely in favor of NW. 
---
Just look at all the threads complaining about the NW challenges or simply about NW in general and how many downvotes each of the people  defending the mode have. If they could bait you into getting banned as easily as it is on the OF they'd 100% do it.
---
That's the Favourites Wheel. Mid-battle, you have to open it, and point in the direction with the joystick and select it. You much more often than not end up choosing the wrong item, assuming you manage to not die in the time it takes to even use it. Even if you bind it to a simple direction such as up or down.
---
I liked the way it used to be where you could mod generic weapons or use unique, comparable versions.
---
Maybe it's a different helmet, but I found the plans for the Marine Helmet (not sure if it has combat in there) in the train carriage between Watoga  and the railyard a coupe of days ago.... It may have been in the railyard on the bench. 
---
I also found the marine legs here a few days prior.
---
Roof papers are desperately needed! Every base is ruined because of that shoddy wooden under-roof...
---
If you need acid that badly a single trip up Tangara town yields like fifty off of the cave crickets.
---
I’m sure they’ll fix it soon, just like the mountain scout mask. Oh that’s right, they never fixed it
---
I think in this case it would be more appropriate it if it was fining for returning a stolen wallet. 
---
In their eyes you shouldn't even have picked the wallet in the first place even if it was to return it to the authorities (them).
---
Which is absurd.
---
You forgot that there's at least a 60% chance that opening the wheel in the first place will cause a lag spike
---
I don't think it was supposed to be in the final version of the game
---
There's usually a yao-guai at this location, but while my camp was there, it rarely attacked unless someone provoked it first. Was a good neighbor lol
---
Try to talk to Duchess first (maybe ever sell her a piece of junk) then go to Smiley. Works for me!
---
I'd like to be able to add Cola as an option also. The AP refresh is kinda wasted if I have to stop what I'm doing and mess with the Wheel Of Lag to use them.
---
They got duped a lot
---
Not everyone who duped got banned or even suspended
---
Even the ones that did get suspended didn't have anything removed from their accounts
---
There are people with legacies who have had them forever and didn't dupe them
---
auto colliders would probably work better tbh
---
I wrote a support ticket and said this exact same thing around sept 2019. Word for word,
---
"imagine how much more money you would make off your game if it didnt "just work" only half the time"
---
"We never asked for nuke winter, theres way better games like cod, we never asked for the atom shop, we got fortnite for that, we never asked for fallout first, we shouldnt have to pay 12$/mo to play singleplayer, and we never asked fallout to be an mmo, theres elder scrolls online for that"
---
"All we wanted was a game like new vegas, fallout 3, fallout 4, skyrim, ect.. a single player game with human npcs with selectable dialog quest choices" 
---
"I even named a List of bugs and glitches that havnt been fixed since launch, hoping the devs would work on them. Alas, not one has been patched to this day. Why are we still adding things to a game that literally glitches out or crashes on us several times a day, instead of FIXING whats already there?" 
---
"The fact that you literally have chosen to not fix any of this until 2 years after release date just proves to thousands of fallout fans around the globe, you dont care about your game like we do."
---
"Get your crap together! One of your biggest fans, Sho."
---
Still to this day ive not recieved a reply and nothing has been fixed so i just quit playing and now i play less and less every update because the game gets worse, and it shouldnt even be like that. 
---
A game revered by so many people you would think, deserves better, and you would thinkk, that someone on the dev team would care enough about what theyr destroying to try to save it but i dont see any effort at all so im done putting in the time. Peace.
---
I turn off every radio that is on. Lol
---
Yes, but you can only get the shotgun by buying the plan from Samuel with bullion at maximum foundation reputation.
---
I'd be fine ditching the daily if it meant he'd keep my turrets maintained. I hate coming home to a gang of level 68 Super Mutants dancing in the rubble of my camp.
---
Are you one of those "must abide to all rules at all times" guys ?
---
I get this with EVERY door. I’ve been jumpscared more by my own front door than wendigos at this point.
---
Some people reported it happening when they logged in around the time the challenges reset (12:30EST I believe) it’s been discussed on here before
---
50
---
Clean review tbh
---
Nope. Fuck them.
---
Well when you accept to abide by a list of rules like on the forum or in the game and you break those rules then they are entirely within their right to punish you. It's the same as all the people who were crying about being banned for duping after they were duping. They broke the rules and were punished they need to take that punishment.
---
Did Todd Howard send you a personal video of him standing on a high chair and shouting with an exaggerated small person voice?
---
because Bethesda cant even clone an object without creating multiple bugs. (Hint THIS IS NOT THE ONLY BUG WITH THIS ITEM!)
---
Seriously this exploit has been posted and even video blogged about on you tube by more than one of there pet You-tubers, I hate to say this but A its a kind of limited bug, (seriously its Reload speed, you cant equip usable mines or explosives with it without mucking with favorites, and sooner or later someone over there will figure out they can solve the problem by fixing the damned typo they somehow put in the Script for this item.(seriously when a Literal  17 yo  modder (turned 17 last may) can fix the problem for you, its probably time to Fire your alleged QA and start over)
---
I don't need acid at all. It's an alternative game play tip. Not every one has to play the game the same way.
---
This is the only reason I refuse to buy anything in the game. I got it at launch for $60, played over a thousand hours, got far more than my money's worth out of it. But I can not in good faith support them with more money and send them a message that I'm fine with the current state of their actions. It doesn't seem so bad because we are used to it happening nonstop for almost two years, but if you take a step back, it's truly ridiculous. We had launch day bugs that showed things were not tested, we had major updates that showed things were not tested, we had atom shop items that showed they were not tested, we **still have launch day bugs unfixed to this day that show they were not tested**. Anybody want to tell me why the endangerol syringer gives the enemy an armor-piercing buff against players? Yeah I thought so
---
Maybe they should make it a daily just to save people being so obsessive about it to get it done 8 times a week :)
---
oh I hate to tell you this....but some items in the atomic shop can be used STILL do dupe items, granted its just nukas and booze. and its probably going to be fixed soon. well soon or soon(tm), up to them.
---
Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?
---
Yeah this happened with me and my partner, was a little confusing. I collect it and she's not bothered about PA so I just got her to claim it and drop it, then I claimed it. Not sure what the spawn is like between people.
---
I feel like the problem absolutely has to be with management. There is no way that devs could be doing this poorly and not get fired over such a long period of time. It has to be somebody in the upper levels not giving them the resources they need to fix things, or disrupting coordination to the point of not letting them work together on what they need to fix
---
You can't mod it. They probably copied the wastelanders version instead of the patch 20 one that can be modded
---
This is the same way every exploit should be viewed. If you dont want people to do something in your game, fix your game you useless trash tier development company. I would literally be embarrassed to work at any position in bethesda.
---
How can you be respected in an industry when you release a skin for armor that literally blocks the players vision in first person. I will tell you how, Gaymers are really dumb, but still, its embarrassing for them.
---
RNG is a B. I haven got one to drop, but I found one in a vendor for 3k. Snatched that puppy up quick.
---
Not to turn this into the Fallout Lore subreddit, but he does admit he’s a former Raider. Maybe he’s supplying his old gang buddies with supplies and getting Vault Dwellers to kill them off for him. If so, I’d respect him a lot more.
---
You do get a higher reward. You get a chance at something a 1* could never drop you. Just because it's not guaranteed doesn't mean it's not a better reward. I believe all the mass testing people have done shows somewhere around a 40% chance for 3* enemies to drop a 3* legendary. That's a nominal 40% more than a 2* or 1* enemy has
---
I’ve really wanted the double-width barn door pieces from Fallout 4 before, and the greenhouse walls would be great too... In fact, if we could just have everything from F4 base building that’s be great.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I think I remember this from late 2018/early 2019 when somebody here decided to map out all the underwater areas in the game. Not anything amazing, but it's one of the best features of the game that you actually get rewarded for exploration with some loot and cool little tidbits of lore/humor
---
I did that with the Chinese ones for months &amp; months :)
---
Yes, it’s been all over this Reddit today
---
That is awesome to hear I've been wanting to update for a while but I had a lot of data invested. Thank you for your input!
---
In fallout 3 it just gave you an AP boost didn’t it? Don’t see why it couldn’t work the same way in this. The slow-mo effect isn’t necessary
---
Post pics if you do something groovy with it
---
Unfortunately workshops instigate pvp. Also  once you log off all your hard work will be wasted too!
---
It might be better to set up a permanent camp *near* a workshop so you can get the resources from the workshop and only have to hop over to your secure camp to conduct your experiments.
---
I'm sorry some people suck.
---
Know anyone with a private server?
---
My bad g thought people were downvoting was like this is a legitimate concern was like 8th left
---
i consistently wake up him, dont talk to him and then sleep in his bed. it's my shitty passive aggressive way of being a dick to him. :/
---
It is an exploit, and it's also supposed to be against the rules to talk about it here.
---
What does a white one cost? 400? Of you dont like the prices, then dont buy it.......
---
Or you can buy all of them including shielded from the enclave production terminal for the urban operative underarmor. BOS and the raider are a pain to get tho
---
I would be fine with this if we could trade more legendary items each day. 150 scripts seems so few considering most things you get from The Rusty Pick will be scrapped again shortly after.
---
Dude it was changed a while ago they never corrected the ingame description.
---
No by moving I mean AFTER the area is nuked, still no?
---
That was changed some time ago and they never corrected the ingame description.
---
Iirc crit is capped at 50% , so if you have Eagle Eyes its kind of pointless. I could be wrong though
---
I ffucking love it
---
You're right these idiots are taking the ingame description of it that Bethesda never updated when they changed it like last year. Don argue with dumb it will only hurt your head.
---
Why would you bother to test anything when hordes of addicted and mindless drones are waiting to throw money at you? What's the worst they'll do? Cancel their F1st subscription? Haha, as if.
---
God, i miss the launch rules.
---
That guy is wrong. It's not the team being in combat, it's the enemy. The SBQ is not in combat because he's in a private server, so he gets true sneak attacks. If it was a public server, the SBQ would be fighting another player and you can't sneak attack something that's in combat.
---
Really? Well, that’s good to know. Thanks for the tip.
---
Just because you’re an asshole.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44182/~/how-does-pacifist-mode-work-in-fallout-76%3F
---
Yeah, I see your point.  However, I still don't think equipping something and then benefiting from their bad code is the problem of any player.   If you don't want people to talk about your bugs--whether how to avoid them or benefit from them--then fix the code.   
---
If benefiting from the bug is something that harms other players, that's one thing.   But unless one is doing PvP, how would this harm anyone or even the game's "economy"?
---
FIX THE CODE.  And try testing your s***.   Seriously, as a former programmer, this is ridiculous.
---
Literally the same as NV...
---
This is not the correct answer. He gets true sneak attacks because the SBQ is alone and not fighting another player, not because of being in a party. You could do what captainoob does with a full party if they are all sneaking. You cannot sneak attack any monster if it is in combat with another player, even if you are hidden.
---
Just an FYI, I think this subreddit is ok with gifting as long as its a true gift and not an obvious trade
---
This.  I thought it was only a problem with the Gatling laser until I read this post.  Mine would either stop firing or reload around 100-200 shots left.
---
I do, it brings a little life back to the apocalypse
---
To someone who never wanted to engage &amp; has done all that they can to avoid it and still get pulled into pvp against their will, it is griefing.
---
People are most likely to be killed when they try to leave, FWIW.
---
I use the orange "shag" that looks like a sponge or Mars....if you squint really hard....
---
lol
---
But people on pc do have multiple accounts for whatever purpose.
---
That article is inaccurate as this is no longer the case. It was changed sometime last year.
---
Is a b2525 fixer that good? I see alot of it on this forum. Only just looked up what the abbreviation mens.
---
Yeah and how often does that happen, come on now. When does an entire team ever sneak during the Sbq fight
---
3000 hour player dropping in to say you should know by now that you cannot sneak attack the SBQ if she's fighting someone else.
---
 Just because you are "hidden" or "caution" doesn't mean the sneak attacks are counted. That's why captainoob is solo, to get "real" sneak attacks.
---
It's actually sad that you've been playing for this long and you didn't realize you can't sneak attack enemies that are in combat.
---
If you have stairs or power conduits your screwed 99% of the time.
---
Overall outfit is amazing. Hands are too clean though.
---
I'd be very proud of myself if I were you. Nice work bud!
---
Basically you just reiterated my point, the queen can’t be “melted” like he was saying.
---
This is something that should have been a thing since day one. Feels like 90% or the time you kill a 3* you get a 1* piece of crap.
---
How hard could it possibly be to make 1stars drop 1 stars, 2 stars drop 2 stars and 3 stars drop 3 stars?
---
Can't hurt the balance that badly, I mean seems like some of the best gear now is craftable only, or that the rampant duping hasn't already pretty much destroyed the games economy.
---
Yup. Remember going to the civil war graveyard to get a black power pistol. If it loaded faster it would have been awesome, but 5even 5 seconds is an eternity when facing down a mob of super mutants or a ticked of bear.
---
Geez, no joke.
---
I turn each one off. Sorry.
---
Yeah look, you’re probably right, I apologise. I’m going through some shit and took it out on a random stranger on the internet. My bad. I’m not deleting my previous post because I probably need the bad karma
---
Add me to the list of people on steam whose fo1st sub stopped working.  My renewal date is today, dlc shows the sub is installed, payment method is fine.  Can’t use tent or stash today.  Tried restarting steam and FO76, no change.
---
I remember triple xp that was crazy
---
It's things like that that make me wish for dedicated pvp server. I love the pve aspect of mmos. Especially, this game. I used to play Perfect World and there was pve or pvp servers.
---
I picked up the wallpaper and the bobble head stand. Not the best of stores but I’m happy to skip buying a bundle this week as well.
---
Dude you don't get it, being solo is a huge advantage for the queen because you cannot score sneak attacks unless the queen is out of combat. 
---
Everyone thinks all you need is to see "caution" and you can score sneak attacks. Not true. If the enemy is in combat, no bonus damage. The popup numbers are lies, watch the health bar.
---
You’ve just reiterated what I was saying. You can’t pull off sneak crits basically. The sbq is in a battle with every person there. Therefore you aren’t going to get sneak crits
---
It’s all good. I turn off all radios that aren’t playing Appalachia Radio.
---
Some things that are generated both as loot and as enemy inventory (i.e ammo, grenades) sometimes take up weight but don't show up in your inventory until you change servers. When you come back, you will be at the proper weight, in that case you would probably be at 192/190 or something
---
Ah.   Thanks for lmk.   How on earth, however, do you find irradiated fluids and hardened mass in SE?   I never find any.   So I always walk away with only four flux.  Someone told me you have to go back about 15 minutes after the event ends; is that correct?   Hunt in the nuke zone?   Are there any other places you particularly like for crimson flux, whether SE or even Morgantown or ???  I am SO not a flux expert.  
---
Twenty legendary drops a circuit?   Holy cow.   I wish.   When did that change?
---
That other guy is wrong. I've been playing for 3k hours and the first thing you need to know is that caution and hidden do not guarantee sneak attack damage, even if the damage popup say you did. You will **only** get sneak attack damage when the enemy is not in combat, meaning that you almost never get sneak attack bonuses in group events.
---
Mostly dupers with burner/mule accounts. A few legit people just have multiple accounts for muling, and a handful of very dedicated players might want to have more than 5 different builds without deleting any, but I am willing to bet that the vast majority are just to offload cheated gear
---
“Zenimax” sounds like a brand of Sanitary towels for Buddhists.
---
The static noise grates my ears, so I always turn those ones off. The rest I usually turn on / leave on though.
---
Always happens after you start shooting and realized you didn't swap your hard bargain and super duper for lone wanderer and bloody mess before shooting at a mob of super mutants. Quickly try to swap cards only to have the 'unopened pack' dialogue come all te while mutants are shooting your nuts off and a mutant hound is chewing on your leg.
---
It is true to an extent but you can't basically say "an exploit is an exploit, period" and treat all of them all with the same level of punishment. Like you're saying by basically putting this little reload glitch on the same level as duping. 
---
They have varying degrees of impact on the game, if any, and therefore should be treated as a case by case in  accordance to the severity.
---
I will
---
I won't bother with Tyler Raceway anymore. Every time I tried to defend this week I had a ghoul get stuck in the concrete bleachers.
---
Tf is the point of a PTS if all this crap gets thru
---
And I'm saying it doesn't matter if the other people in the battle are on your team, it matters if they have been detected by the queen or not.
---
It works with molotovs, because I use it during Encryptid (since I die so much during that event) and molotovs are useful for tagging a bunch of enemies at once.
---
I like to just keep spamming the help me emote but was sorely tempted to kill some guys last night after I watched them bully someone off the game where I was trying to use the vendor (which was irritating enough having spent 50 caps to get over there) and then they started trying to trigger me into it.
---
Thing is pvp is a broken mess, so while I know I could have magic gunned them out of existence in the first instance having a free shot since they were tagging me, it would have then mean I needed to leave server myself or face a non-stop 2v1 vs explosive gatling plasmas. Ugh.
---
When I can’t scrip any more, I put up the legendaries for sale for a little less than their suggested community price. If they don’t sell, then they get scruples the next day. 
---
If I’m out of stash space, I’ll go to Whitespring and buy materials that I need so the vendors have caps again, and then sell the 1 and sometimes 2 star legendaries to them for caps again.
---
Ol I was hoping it would. And does it work with artillery smoke nades tho? If six that's gonna be a deadly combo
---
Oh on that metal camper the walls aren’t solid :) or they weren’t anyway, idk if they fixed that. You could jump through both side windows and the back panel. I found out bc I almost fell out of one and off of a cliff side, since that’s where it was sitting in someone’s camp.
---
It’s great.
---
Why change something that works? Like look at how good the daily challenges are and you really want to get something out into the same system?
---
Plus being the tone zone I'm in now it can be a pain in the butt where dailies reset but I know with a 20 hour reset I can always log in after work svd I'm good to go
---
Haaahahah thanks!
---
West Tek roof, yeah.
---
How stable is this mod and BGS updates? I figured it would be a pain to keep running   every update. FO4 was getting annoying whith updates screwing up some mods. I have yet to try FO76 since they break basic game elements every patch, I figured mods would be even worse....
---
Honestly, I have contemplated on getting another account for muling because it really sucks to have a lot of your gear stuck with you due to weight limitations.
---
It's broken, but now how you think.  
---
The SB ALWAYS spawns, it just doesn't always spawn in the correct location.  For example in the mire if you're activating the lure to the east of Harper's ferry the SB can spawn to the south down the cliffside and if you're doing the one on the other side of the mire it spawns in  the forest to the west.   You have to go and piss it off and eventually it will disappear and respawn over by the lure where it belongs.
---
When in Watoga, did you go to Phoenix Bot in the Plaza as well as the Training station?
---
Yea just look at how many re-skinned mounts and pets are in ESO. Some of which cost an unreasonable amount of money or, in most cases, crown gems.
---
All quad crossbows do this and is one of the funnest weapons to use in the game. I stumbled upon a couple different versions naturally and in vendors before wastelanders dropped so I know exactly what you mean. The weapon seems to have a bottomless clip as long as you have at least 2 bolts loaded, you can feather the trigger and fire like 20 bolts.
---
If you put a explosive mod on it and aim for the legs, then you can turn any enemy into fireworks cause when they die they go flying.
---
It's silent too.
---
The varient you have with the "scope" mod is a rare mutation and you won't be able to put it back on if you take it off. It doesn't do anything, but certainly increase the value of it. It's like the standard paint VS standard appearance mutation or whatever that can happen on handmade rifles and other weapons too like the colored baseball bat's.
---
https://youtu.be/797YHlH5piM
---
The whole team sneaks when you want a 5 second kill
---
It's still broken. I found out because I bought it about a week ago and *immediately* walked straight through it. I can't believe it hasn't ever been fixed.
---
The other is to just build a Acid camp on one of the Acid vents that liter Appalachia because its a bad pun because Acid is slang for LSD and several of the vents are clearly references to West Virginia drug problem,  heck their is one in the middle of the Forest map next to a very unethical "Medical" company...
---
They said it is a bug, that will be fixed.
---
No date for it and I can not give a link, I read it in this sube yesterday.
---
I got one the other day as well. Put it on my camp companion ;)
---
Bethesda employees are the type of people to download 300 Fallout 4 mods and install them all at the same time without reading descriptions.
---
I do, yeah. I even go to whitesprings and check the bos vendor there too. Both mods and plans
---
It is atom shop item. It will be most likely fixed very soon. (Well, the bugged Prime PA skinks never got the fixes, but other things did, like the waterwheel).
---
Some stuff on the shop suck; don’t buy it. We all know that. But they do come out w/ some cool stuff. Daddy Todd got to keep the lights on somehow mah dude
---
That's right. Mine broke the other day and I couldn't fix it :/ I had to log out and relog, I thought it was bugged for good. I would have never set foot in radiation rumble again lol
---
As of late three stars drop one stars about 80% of the time. They gimped three star drops recently, making the daily scrip collection a grind.  My best weapons are three star natural drops, luckily I have a ton of good legendaries stocked up, but can always could use more... Time to start scrapping some of my 250 drwr weapons. They are never going to fix this effect.
---
Who doesn't like Prize-Bot??
---
He showed up about 5 times for me the other day and every time I got so excited!
---
6. Farmable "premium" crops like Cranberries, Brain Fungus and other wild plants. Including a way to farm or grow Mothman eggs...
---
7. Machinery that you can place materials into to produce other items over time. Maybe some sort of robot-run cooking station?
---
8. Ways to generate Spices, Pepper, Salt, or Sugar Bombs
---
9. Automated collection from purifiers and other camp-based resource generation. Would be nice to have a robot pick my crops from time to time!
---
10. Auto-restock my camp vendors if i have the same item(s) in my stash and its marked for "auto-stocking".
---
11. Ability to scale camp-objects. Then I can finally make those huge workbenches fit nicely on a shelf.
---
and finally the biggest game-changing feature EVER!!
---
**Allow my camp vending machines be configured to BUY-BACK specific items I want from players and set the buy price!!!! I want all your Pepper, Spices, Sugar Bombs and Bobbleheads!**
---
We all know that the Serious gamers have at least 2 nodes or other multiple spawns they can harvest, Even if one of there neighbors are SBs and floaters and supermutants and Crypteds and small frogs, granted Ive only seen the frogies once,
---
Thank you all for the positive feedback 😊
---
The general IQ of the world's population is rather low. This is not limited to F76.
---
Repair kits are in the atom store where advanced repair quests drop from queen event. Let's have similar and have freezers drop from a quest or something but a fridge absolutely should be as good as level 3 good with salt
---
I just hung around for radiation rumble and just made sure I tagged as many as I could until the score achievement came up :D
---
Imagine brown nosing this hard. Your nose is stuck my guy, pull it out.
---
Edit just saw its not showing stats It didn't work
---
i got the camo SS underarmor but i cant find it my workbenchs to craft it.
---
Just kill the Chinese Toaster-Bots outside Vault 76. I use a Ski Sword to knock out 2 Combat Challenges as well (counts for Melee and Improvised Weapon challenge.)
---
I got mine from trading, about 6 months ago. It is most likely duped, and Ill retire it as soon as I craft a gauss minigun that I want.
---
When I traded it, I was not aware about duped items sadly.
---
this is wildly incorrect. you can't take damage from other players, and your camp can still be destroyed through explosive bait, nukes, and other methods
---
Whenever I see a red rocket in a player camp it will be closed. I mean 100% of the time. Then the following will happen: I run up and press x to open it. I watch as the door disappears to show the garage is open, and then closes down from the top. I then press x again to have it open back up and stay open. 
---
I WOULD BUY ONE OF THESE FOR ATOMS IF THEY "JUST WORKED"
---
\^ shouting to see if B can hear me... (nope)
---
bro you're literally wrong
---
Yeah, it works 99% of the times.
---
I have 40,000 steel. lol
---
Nope. I'd remember their user names and torture them anytime you encountered them in random servers. Losers destroying people's camps are asshats and deserve death. Repeatedly.
---
can you just take the door off? I thought it was part of the structure (don't own it)
---
Thats why I never will move my camp. I do not have the willpower to rebuild it from scratch.
---
Maybe so! However, I still want it so I don't have to scroll past 20 bobbles at the top of my stash every time I access it!
---
Not sure why but that made me laugh. Would love to see that.
---
I agree, Wastelanders took me a few months. Started day one, finishes the last day of Fasnacht, still have Beckets quest to do.  Though I realized the legendary scrip grind is way slower than the boullon grind, so I don't even always bother to cash in treasury notes the few days a week I play anymore.  I have rolled 400 secret service armour pieces, gotten 7 god roll unyielding and bolstering pieces, still haven't gotten a single vanguard piece yet.  I so wish we could trade them.
---
Yep, one of those holotapes left behind by the last humans.
---
it's on the retired topics list but the mods don't do shit on this sub
---
Okay.
---
More like 2228.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
The fuck are you talking about?  If you can only apply the casual lining to it that means it has roughly the same value as the fucking vault suit underarmor.  You grinded bullion for the ACTUAL SS underarmor which gets the ACTUAL SS underarmor lining stats.  No one grinds for the SS underarmor just for the looks, it's the lining that matters.
---
I would have bought the camouflage SS paint... If it was
---
One a bundle i.e underarmor and armor togeather.
---
Two, if there wasn't a free one that I can get doing the legendary run
---
I never buy new items anymore. I just wait a day to hear about all the shit that's wrong with them and then wait for a week or two for it to get patched.
---
so... no mr fuzzy nuke box?!? why?!?!?
---
That is super amazing info, buddy. Thank you so much, I will indeed put a new frame on it! I appreciate your response to my post 🙂
---
It can't be repaired! 
---
I gave mine to my ally
---
I still say we need an emote to properly vent our frustration and disappointment with this game. It would become the most used emote by far.
---
A player just dropped their unneeded notes, that’s all it is.
---
No, they started so they asked for death. That's their problem now, don't start what you can't finish.
---
Someone just dumped all their holotapes and notes, you don't need to hang onto them and they can actually cause inventory lag.
---
Just a warning: if you get downed but not killed, it can kill you. Not so useful if you would rather have a player revive you.
---
No problem, it's seriously one of my favorite weapons to use. I buy any Xbow bolts people sell for 1 caps because those little guys are expensive to craft. The other frame modifications work just as well, but explosive is by far the most fun. Plasma is pretty interesting too.
---
xD i don’t either. I was just going to redo my camp since my old one was made by a friend in like 2 minutes and I was kinda tired of it
---
Sorry, there was a "Medical company" in WV that was used to produce and test a wide diverse and long list of Drugs what were assumed to be Performance enhancing, ranging from LDS to to amphetamines to Steroid cocktails  and Pain killers of various descriptions, and even a variety of mixed drug coctails for the US Military and CIA.
---
I just found it amusing that next to the wreck of a pre war medical manufacture there was an Acid Vent
---
I’ve gotten the raider shielded drop without learning the lesser mods before hand. I read somewhere that if you wait and do rose’s missions after you reach lvl50 that there’s a chance for it to drop. So I tried that and got lucky the second time around. I like to think of it as a feature and not a bug.
---
I still remember that poor PTS player that made a thread regarding all the testing and bug reporting they did for Fasnacht, just for Bethesda to go ahead and release the event as broken as is it was in PTS (no critters spawning so you couldn't complete it). So obviously they had to take it down for while to actually go and fix it like they were supposed to do in the first place.
---
Why can’t Beth add a freezer instead of a fridge :(
---
I have 5. I have won the pie lottery hitting the machines. They’re the centerpiece of my diner.
---
A week or two ago I got one after an endless number of tries.
---
Nah, im.ok with dying, as long as I can either kill or severely damage them when they go to loot or finish me off, I'm happy. Plus I can always get revenge too and do it again
---
not sure there’s a more frustrating story then that. Sorry mate. Bash a ghoul over the head with the shovel. Might make you feel better. 😃
---
And it starts with 500 rounds then when it reloads goes to 250
---
Like... why?
---
I have to 2nd the suggestion that you look into Fallout 4.
---
I spent weeks planning out and building in the very first cul-de-sac alone! You even get a merry band of settlers that call it home as well.
---
If $$ is an issue I wouldn't mind gifting it to you.
---
That said, if you're truly hooked on Appalachia...
---
You're curious how to handle it, now that you have a better understanding of the motives behind it. Problem is, there really isn't any specific *way* to handle it as each encounter will be different.
---
Fighting back might chase some off, but more often it would just create a feedback loop of constant firefights for revenge. You'd be giving them just what they want, an eager opponent. 
---
Others might just be trying to hold the shop long enough for the 1st defend mission, so they can get the plans and rewards from it. They'd probably bail if you contested it from the start but it's a coin toss on which type of player you get. 
---
My suggestion is;
---
Invite them to a team. When they claim your shop send an invite for a build team and if they accept, just keep building as you were. They will probably just leave you be while setting up whatever resource extractor they wanted or might even go off to run their own mission while waiting for the defend. 
---
It's possible they might interpret the request as you wanting help, which I figure you kind of don't but a few 'No' emotes from you should give them the general idea that you just want to be left to do your own thing. 
---
As an aside, thanks for making this 40 year old feel like less of an old fart 'round these parts. ;p
---
Heck ya, the crafting is soooo rough, especially when useing a new character. I got an absolute poop ton of Ultracite bolts from someone, so I wanted to put them to use haha
---
I have a b2525 and I'd hate to be judged purely because of that. At the time I traded some great armour, weapons and plans trying to get things I wanted. The day after I got my b2525 fixer I found out about there was a dupe glitch active when I saw the person I traded with offering another b2525 for trade with someone else so I came to reddit and learned of the glitch then because yes rare weapons aren't that common. Now what I traded I'm certainly not going to get back, I'm not going to be dropping the fixer just because it was commonly duped. My point is simply not everyone who has these rolls is a duper though it's hard to deny many whether directly or indirectly have something that's been duped.
---
He didn’t know it was a bug. How was anyone to “know” it was a bug, you may have suspected but you didn’t “know”. 
---
We were given fireworks for free with no explanation of their use. We all assumed they were just aesthetic but someone noticed they increased reload speed. They thought this was by design and so informed the community. In my opinion, given some of the unusual effects some things are attributed in this game it is not an unreasonable assumption to make.
---
Bethesda could have said, “it’s not a design please don’t use or discuss with the community”. Bethesda could have withdrawn the fireworks. Bethesda could have fixed the bug. Instead they chastised the user, how was he to “know” it was an exploit? 
---
Please remember not all of us have your Godlike power of “Knowing” every Bethesda intention.
---
Is Oxhorn using exploit? He has magic shotgun 😂
---
Yes, and I just bought the Arktos fridge from the Atom Shop so clearly I'm mad 🤪
---
Very nice of you, add me if you want my psn is Phawnix. I sometimes need help with little things and I can help you out as well if you need.
---
RNG, I traded for it, since I'm a collector of all apparel, but drop chances are very slim. Besides, you'll never know - few days ago I looted Radiation Barrel plan from that event.
---
I think killing the bots in bots on parade also count?
---
PvP is PvP, reddit hates all kinds for no good reason.
---
Ultracite Plasma Gatling, 500 rounds, had it reload at 382
---
In the past, modders would fix their shit for them. Most of their games, if not viewed through rose tinted glasses because of mods, can only be described as mediocre or half assed.
---
Now that modders are no longer fixing their shit it's becoming more and more obvious that Bethesda isn't just lazy, they are also inept. There is NO other explanation for this. None.
---
Bugs take ages to fix, if they get fixed at all, and about half of those fixes break something else. 
---
It's the same with the PTS. Why have that when the build that's being run on there gets additional bug fixes, that aren't tested, shortly before patch day? Adrenaline being broken is a prime example. If whatever broke that would have been in the PTS it would have been noticed. 
---
If any other company would do what Bethesda does they'd be roasted over the coals all day long. Bethesda, however, is special. It's as if their rabid fanboys with their Todd cult mentality shield them from any repurcussions whatsoever. 
---
That's their deal. They can't be bothered because they know they can do whatever they want and still have the shortbus passengers defending them to the death.
---
How to you destroy a camp? Was feature not removed a long time ago?
---
Would probably charge 500 atoms for it too
---
As in it doesn't let you or the mods don't do anything? Because I just put Shielded on mine earlier and it at least says it worked.
---
Edit: I've just realised you meant the Camo one, not the one that costs Gold. Still, how did they fuck up copy-pasting it with a different texture?
---
I had no idea, I just play video games.
---
Bethesda is such a joke. Seriously, no worse game company comes to my mind.
---
I mean, EA is also really bad and shit on their costumers too, but at least, they aren't so extremely incompetent.
---
The multiple copies deal is for people that never want to socialize. 
---
They can dual box with 2 PC's running at the same time and get benefits like having a 'virtual' NPC that holds all their extra gear and gives them a buff via the team function. 
---
My friend does this AND has a 1st subscription, he just logs on with his 'main' on each computer and then keeps his mule at camp, periodically moving him so as to not get autologged etc.
---
The mire, where you on too of the cliff, if you look down the cliff to the left it spawns there normally, the cranberry bog it spawns at the railway yard up the top, I find shooting it it will come running eventually.
---
Your who's been turning on the radios that I've turned off.
---
I for one wanted a multiplayer fallout.

The best mods for strangler heart are nearly impossible to get plans for.   And you need the Vault steel to build strangler and  you can only buy that in small quantitues each day from the purveyor. T-65 has better damage resistance than stangler heart.   Some people here are saying it's only a little more damage resistance.  Well, the acid damage from Strangler heart is only a little more damage output. And some of the mods for strangler heart are virtually impossible to get. You can only get them as plans from the queen. I have killed literally  hundreds of queens and not once have I gotten plans for calibrated shocks, targeting hud, or emergency protocols.  Finding these mods is nowhere near as easy as some people  here make it sound.  If you find someone on here selling plans for them, expect them to want something ridiculous like 15k steel. There's countless stories on here from people who got ripped off doing those kinds of trade deals.  The immense headache acquiring mods for Strangler heart is not worth a little extra acid damage.  I have a full set of T-65 and it's my favorite armor in the game.
---
I know you're saying it half jokingly but it really is the root of the problem.
---
So long as the bottom line is not getting hurt, they have no reason to change. If anything, i saw that people fanboying Bethesda are really on another level compared to other ones ive came across for other games companies. 
---
They'll resort to any kind of shitty excuses so long as it allows their heads to remain in the sand so they can selfishly vomit money at Bethesda/Zenimax/ whatever, like any proper whale would at the expense of the rest of the playerbase and the elevation of the game quality.
---
This. I'll also add more variety of stairs, like twisted ones or wooden. All that are available doesn't fit very well to "wooden-themed" houses.
---
I used this one before too for the same reason haha. But imagine a hole building with the space wallpaper. (double walls so you have the wallpaper inside and outside of the building) +the floor and roofs in this design. Now that's what I call a space place lol
---
That modern kitchen you see in basically every single house in the game that makes the “L” shape to work as a cooking station for one would be a nice addition for all the decorators
---
😈
---
How do they know whats duped? Like I have an exploding gat laser from like the first month in game. Or am I okay because its not a TSE gat laser?
---
What’s the problem with the RR door?
---
Edit: Is that the door that slides on both sides that doesn’t fit a door frame properly?
---
You have several Perks to protect you from dying + legendary armor effects. I play borderlands too but this mechanic is not needed in here
---
My thoughts also.   Former programmer/analyst/dba here.
---
Have fun friend. If you are specced out for stealth and single shot rifles, it increases the damage a significant amount as well. You could enough use sandman, but it's not necessary. Vats perks do benefit as well because the weapon fires as fast as you can pull the trigger. I use the thing like a mini gun.
---
I meant Gatling laser which is 184 (ultracite in my case). The FPS on the queen is catastrofic. I want to try it solo but the adds are very annoying and there are so many of them
---
100% this. Most people take pride in doing a great job, especially something they are passionate about. It probably comes down to poor time management by upper levels, due to wishy-washy vision &amp; direction by top levels. I worked for a company that did this all the time, and everything that was put out was severely rough around the edges and wonky.
---
For sure, he a stealth/vats/crit build. I was having fun just with a bow, but it's on now haha
---
I’m just running a head cannon that they’re tempering our expectations for future content so they aren’t setting a “standard”
---
I need way more budget to create anything decent.. 
---
Larger camps look empty
---
Smaller camps you cant even turn your butt without touching something else.
---
Even the 50% discount is still quite expensive. As in everything else, Bethesda is in pricing bad too
---
Strangler has only a little more damage resistance, but stranlger heart gives only a little bit of damage bonus from the acid. And the mods for stranlger heart are nearly immpossible to find.  I have killed literally hundreds of queens and have never gotten plans for targeting HUD, calibrated shocks, or emergency protocols.  The strangler heart is not supposed to be tradeable, which means you can't just give it to someone else to mod.I know people were trading it anyway, because of some exploit, but I thought I heard Bethesda patched it.
---
Someone on the trading sub might be looking to sell plans for mods, but they will almost certainly be asking for something ridiculous like 15k steel or 3ok 5.56.   I have actually seen someone selling Ultacite calibrated shocks for 15k steel. There is no guarantee that you will actually get the plans if you agree to trade 15k steel for plans.
---
I seriously doubt a little acid bonus is worth the headache acquiring mods for the average player who just wants to enjoy the game.
---
Honestly I hope Bethesda somehow loses the rights to the Fallout franchise
---
So do I, 
---
and to be honest there are all kind of weird side references in the fallout games that if you catch them are interesting, like the Fallout 4 references with the Mistress of Mystery,  the references to Ironman in Fallout New Vegas, Granted some of the references are actually hidden in the game code, but others are out there is you look at it sideways.
---
All timed reset things should reset at the same time everyday by default, imo.
---
At 8am eastern time, just like updates.
---
Last laugh + nuka grenades + grenadier 2  + demo 5 was my jam in survival.
---
It was a brutal combo “in my day” and it was usually the sprinting cavalier melee builds that got it lol.
---
" If whatever broke that would have been in the PTS it would have been noticed. "   Maybe it was noticed on the PTS--like mentioned in the above post about the PTS player who notified them and they released stuff anyway--but they choose to go ahead anyway.   They say past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior, and if they did it with the Fasnacht critters.....
---
It's a way bigger problem that when you call bethesda out on their BS people bend over backwards to defend them. I get it, I love fallout 76 at its core but fundamentally it could be a lot better if they did some quality testing. 
---
You ever complain that something could be done better on this sub? 100% chance someone is gonna call you entitled.
---
Maybe I have a fucking mental handicap and never noticed a lack of sneak attack multiplier in public events. Maybe the reason I don't run with teams is because of said handicap. Maybe you should know by now that dropping into a civil discussion just to insult someone's intelligence is a shameful thing to do. 
---
Anyway, whether they're "real" sneak attacks or not, it has absolutely no bearing on the fact that my damage numbers show 600-800 per shot with an automatic weapon, which is almost as ridiculous as your attitude.
---
Dope
---
yep adding now :)
---
What makes them harmful?
---
Use mods at your own risk. The developers code NOTHING in the game according to mod usage. This is why SFE continues to break with each patch. It's the cost of coloring outside the lines.
---
The BE laser rifle is not just a legacy, it's a hacked weapon that has unlimited range and doesn't break because it's a mix of accessories from the NW version of the gun injected into adventure mode. It's the best pvp gun available.
---
Thats quite disappointing, I'm sorry. My brother wanted to pick it up, glad he didn't..
---
Military always sells
---
Oh ok cool
---
No yea I totally get that, a lot of video games do pop culture references or references to real life things even though the landscape isn't exactly the same. I guess I hadn't thought of acid nodes in this game referencing drug activity, nor would I know about that sort of thing about WV since I live on the West Coast.
---
It’s a robot, so that makes sense. Thanks for letting us know.
---
Amazing. Well done
---
Are exploding weapons what makes a gun legacy? Bc in game loot gave me a pipe pistol that shoots exploding bullets
---
well said. When will companies in general take note that sustainable development will make them FAR more money long term...
---
600 to 800 is nothing and the damage popup are wildly inaccurate. Don't flex about your playtime if you are still getting the basics of the game wrong.
---
That was incredible. They were told for several weeks that critter spawns were broken, chose to ignore it anyways, pulled the event because of the outrage and had to apply a hotfix to stop the riots from spreading further.
---
This company is unbelievable.
---
Honestly, the way they portrayed them in fallout 4 was really dumb. They all obey Maxson like he’s a fucking saint, while they all shun the synths and advocate for genocide. They also leech off of settlements to survive or they’ll kill them, so I honestly couldn’t find a reason as to why I should pick them. It doesn’t help that literally every companion does nothing but complain about them every chance they get.
---
And when I say they don’t do anything but complain about the brotherhood of steel, I MEAN IT. I’ve spent around five minutes straight with nothing but aggressive anti-brotherhood comments from every companion.
---
Cannot agree more. Sometimes it seems like they never bothered to even launch the game after some patches.
---
That's why I told them that they need to open access on the pts for cosmetic items. They told me that the atomic shop was disabled on the pts and that's the reason they couldn't do let us test atomic shop items. Which is patronizing since I know they just need to let the items be available for crafting by flipping a switch. You could build some cosmos cosmetics back before the wastelanders release even on the Pts.
---
No, you are not.  Good on you.
---
Is a 200% core worth all that flux? You get a fusion core each time you craft a gatling laser, but it's easier to take a power plant.
---
Pretty sure that’s a latency issue. Has to do with server connection. It’s happened ever since the game came out
---
judgding someone for having a gun... ahhahaha oh god. pfff
---
Same thing here with Stimpack diffuser, cost me an arm and a leg and never use them
---
Can confirm int helps. I have a lot of ultracite plasma cores that are past 100%
---
It's classed as a live broadcast, they have to pay royalties whenever they play songs, as a radio station would, hence the limited playlist.
---
A level 8 did it to me yesterday.  I'm at 280.   I don't get it.   Bait for a much higher level partner?  
---
I just FT'd and blocked him.
---
That happens to my 2S tesla gun too.
---
Also an issue with auto laser rifles: I’ll empty the capacitor but the ammo count will tell me I still have four rounds left to fire. It’s pretty broken.
---
So true. At least with nexus you have support if something goes wrong. God I hope that fo4 MP mod takes off.
---
We are \*already\* getting CAMP items, skins, and outfits.
---
Some people are reserving the perk packs with the hopes that they will make it easier to obtain and level-up Legendary Perk cards.
---
Some people like me also very much enjoy getting Atoms and Gold Bullion from the journey as well.
---
The problem is that they cannot please everyone with every item. What might appeal to person A might not appeal to person B. If the entire journey was nothing but CAMP items, folks would be complaining that they are no longer getting Atoms. If it was nothing but skins, folks would be complaining about no CAMP items, and so forth.
---
As it is now, it's a balance, and it actually got me to look at the weekly and daily challenges, which I was completely ignoring before, so it’s a total win for me.
---
Accounts are not characters. You can have multiple characters, you don't need to get a new account, just create a new character.
---
Zen IMAX for your 3D meditation movies

I usually play between 10  and 14 GMT-1

I knew it.
---
I've given up on this event. Most of the time, I cannot activate the lure. I think its only worked twice for me. It's a shame too, because the 2 times it did work, I liked it.
---
Enclave, Old Guard (Added with Wastelanders), one of the many Army, Navy, Marine or Air Force units make there own faction
---
Well I do sbq quite often so dont really have a flux shortage, but I understand where you are comeing from. This is just for those ppl frugal with cores like me.
---
Also I have more than a 100 in my inventory so I like to experiment.
---
It was fixed for like a week in the pts back when the pts was private.
---
Gives you +2 to all special stats if you’re in a group, also gets boosted even higher if you have strange in numbers.
---
Tell me what an average day of playing is like for you, please.
---
What kinds of habits do you have?
---
How do you exit the game when you’re done playing?
---
Do you server hop a lot?
---
Do you play NW?
---
Have you ever used an exploit?
---
Do you play during the challenge reset?
---
Etc.
---
I’m genuinely curious. There has to be something that people with this issue have in common and if we get enough common evidence we can possibly find the culprit.
---
I myself have never been affected by this bug.
---
It works for converting fusion or plasma cores into ultracite. 
---
To answer your question no it is not worth it to create base fusion cores.
---
Maybe the entitlement mindset of "I get to do whatever I want but don't you dare think you can do s\*\*\* back".   Who knows.
---
Thanks for the tip. May have to go after one now. :)
---
true
---
Set hard limits for stashed junk, between 30 and 75 for most materials. I sell my extra junk cheap at my camp. As for vending: Try to remember what moves quickly, only offer thiat. Ammo converter and raider bot have changed the market, only a few ammo types and chems are worth offering, convert the rest or sell to bot vendors. Switch teams often, travel to camps for free, check the vendors out. I often buy cheap weightless legendaries, stash those light ones for scrip later while scripping heavier ones asap. I use maps and bobby pins as a cap sink, those are weightless. I buy fixer plans to sell later since this seems to be one of the most sought schematics (worth 8-10k for 0.25 weight). I limit my carried weapons down to 5 (melee, shotgun, allround rifle, sniper rifle, gatling plasma for the big encounters) and have only a few more stashed that are fun using sometimes (for example a 10mm smg i switch my shotgun out for, to burn the accumulated 10mm ammo at some point). If a weapon is neither fun to use nor helpful for your build, you should offer it. If it doesn't sell lower the price, then scrip it if it only takes up space. I even scripped god roll pistols, it hurts sometimes, but noone uses pistols  tbh and i couldnt sell it for 300caps. Just scrip and try not to think about it.
---
That's actually a good idea.it arcs across all enemies right? Will keep an eye out in vendors for a good one.
---
What's the range like?
---
He's a drunk too. Notice all the empties around his home and work trailers. Might help explain some of his weird behaviors.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ.  If you're trying to rationalize that it's 100% believable that Bethesda would add in fucking FIREWORKS that just by having equipped double your reload speed then you're beyond talking to.
---
That is beyond stupid.
---
I managed to bank 25 level ups at 353 during x2 xp.
---
Way better than double score

"ZeniMax- keeps your flow and feng shui in order"

Yeah, that must have been satisfying.   :)   You did well.

Yeah that happened to me earlier and I wondered how mine jumped from 14 to 50 in a matter of seconds in a fight
---
A shovel is good comedy value, keep it and enjoy the sound effects :-)

I love the idea. However I want to let you know that the plural of “ally” is “allies.”

Edit: my dream ally would be a sex robot like fisto, except I’d want a sentry bot. Don’t judge me.

Bos is literally my least favorite faction among all Fallout games. I think they are overrated, boring and actually more on the villain side. But since army and military based factions are huge hits in the gaming world, Bethesda focuses on them a lot. I think Enclave is much more interesting than any other faction. I miss the old Bos of the first and second games; they were mysterious, interesting, running into them was an anticipated event. They’re just boring villains right now.
---
If you don't get an answer I can check in the morning when I get off work
---
I listen to music irl sometimes while playing.
---
Personally I think FO76 needs to be turned into a single player game with multiplayer support on private servers, and enable modding. Once that's done, move the devs onto another project and shutdown the Beth servers.
---
No one would use it there not after PVP there just trying to bully others. The second the fight turns and poof like a fart in the wind there gone.
---
bloodied / faster fire rate 25% / 25 ap cost reduc
---
you can kill the queen solo in 1min without glitch
---
That would be much appreciated thank you!
---
week 2748548348 - In Atom Shop is stable. Still shit.
---
INT affects crafted fusion core charge?
---
Amazing! wow!
---
Request Government Air Drop quest will activate if you find a US Government Supply Requisition holotape out in the wild but that Quest is only active while you are in that Server if you go to a different server/log off/disconnect than the quests fails/cancels so that US Government Supply Requisition holotape that you initially found in that last server becomes useless so just drop them and you must find a new US Government Supply Requisition holotape on that server you are on in order to reactivate the quest. 
---
Beware to anyone reading those I have seen some players either knowingly or unknowingly selling these useless US Government Supply Requisition holotapes at their CAMP vendor. DO NOT BUY THEM!
---
Lol I hear you there.
---
It does for me, but I'll do more experimenting FOR SCIENCE
---
I hope you aren't fighting sbq just for legendaries.
---
Is it a broken gun or something I don't see how something can be that powerful haha
---
Heavy gunner build with power armor here. I don't use either one and I do just fine.  Melee attacks from enemies are not a big deal if you aren't a bloodied build and you wear power armor.   So blocker isn't even necessary.   I use bandoleer because I like carrying a crap load of ammo and bear arms because I like carrying a variety of heavy weapons.  I do fine without blocker.
---
Last time I had this happen, entering then exiting power armor fixed it for me. May not work for you, but I'd still give it a try.
---
Awesome if so. I've never crafted them, only looted or bought them.
---
Thanks, I'll try that
---
Broken armor piece?
---
I had tears (not openly sobbing just A little most) of joy when this game was revealed as I’m from West Virginia and be trailers looked beautiful 
---
They are now tears of sadness And impotent rage. Fuck Bethesda man
---
Yes it does and before you ask Sizzling Style does also work with matching Armor and Power Armor.
---
Only certain guns.
---
More like Zeniminimum.
---
Yeah I’m working on T-65 and not blooded (mostly use Vampire weapons so my HP doesn’t go down too much unless it’s the imposter sheep-bot) but I’m trying to be super tanky without sacrificing too much damage.
---
Oh Okay, thanks
---
I found your camp muhahaha
---
You forgot to lock your extractors and your prices are too damn high! That is all.
---
I did eventually find mine at Phoniex Bot after server hopping for 2hrs.
---
If you want an easy BE energy gun, get a gauss minigun.
---
There should be a hole with oil, from all the rotation ;-) , but it never even shows green, not even for a fraction of a second :(
---
They couldn’t reproduce the bug didn’t your hear their sad excuse?!?!...ie they hadn’t figured out how to get to the event to try it out themselves or they were too lazy too get out of the vault.
---
Oh cool I'll add you when I'm on
---
So far no &gt;:(
---
You spin me right round baby right right round round.
---
Ha ha.
---
Wow.  Smh.  I completely forgot he existed.
---
Laughs in gatling lasers are?broken
---
Bro, No.
---
This gives you an extra 73 vendor resets over the year, you are asking for a 110k caps a year, nerf.
---
As a shareholder you don’t care much though, you want the company to get as much money for as little cost now and then sell out and buy shares somewhere else when people catch on.
---
It would be nice if they gave atoms after like gears 5 change their system to. Its a pretty good way to reward players who have invested in their game
---
Only if you do it on purpose, is my interpretation: "Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, taking advantage of exploits or cheats"
---
By design I believe, it's not a skin but a new outfit I believe, so not earned through gold, so no mods :-)
---
I've never personally had that issue but I make sure to join a team so I can respawn using the social menu.
---
Why you gotta attack my gaming addiction like that :/
---
Thanks for tips. I have just discovered a whole new game and activity in FO76
---
Are you using a bloodied build? I've started experimenting with a bloodied stealth rifleman but haven't got a good bloodied weapon yet.
---
Yeah that's what I meant, I took the door off.
---
This is the buggiest game I have ever played honestly.
---
You know the first 6 months of the game I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. Its a big game, its Bethesda, its a new type of game for them.
---
But we are almost 2 years in and im suffering from more bugs and glitches then I ever have with the game atm.
---
Its not good enough. Especially when they are getting more and more egregious with monetization.
---
The fact we have to wait a solid month for a bug to be fixed too, when they are expecting players to login everyday. Fast travel bug (been with us longer then a month now) Vats being completely broken, clipping through walls, being stuck in power armour, heck, fusion cores and plamsa cores are still a mess as ammo, Adrenaline completely useless, rubber banding health, magic weapons, countless and constant duping, challenges auto completing (been in the game for AGES) and cosmetics and items brought in to the game broken as hell.
---
Just a few ive experienced and still experienced. All for £11.99 a month. Cant be bad eh?
---
Do Bethesda honestly think this wont be bad for long term image? Man. I dont think so. I played to death every fallout game from Beth and Oblivion, Skyrim etc. I can have tons of fun with this game too.
---
Difference being now, with my experience with 76, I expect nothing but a broken and buggy mess with Starfield. I have zero confidence in this companies ability to have a game that is fully functional. AAA developer? Dont make me laugh.
---
yeah bethesda has had that philosophy ass backwards for a minute now
---
Seems like the biggest statement that you can rely on a bethesda reply to a post about something like a pretty camp or a touching story, but totally silent when someone (or LOTS OF PEOPLE) address a significant issue. E.g I’ve seen posts about the fast travel bug for months and never once seen a reply.
---
I turn them off. Especially when I enter the Whitespring Station, immediately take the cake and turn off the radio.
---
Yea it's just a fun little thing that nobody really talks about. You can build an arena and lure other creatures into it or if you have a camp pet see how it reacts, it might even help you too! I could never figure out how to tame creatures.
---
He should be careful about posting videos of exploits showing his main account name though. It *is* an exploit, which it's probably impossible for them to track and ban for the use of, but encouraging the use of is also banable. Quoting the ToS again as I did on another comment here:
---
"[You agree not to access, receive, play or use any Service to:] Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, taking advantage of exploits or cheats."
---
Much like stacking tech data, don't bother
---
Bethesda's brotherhood are trash. 
---
The Fallout NV BH are much better.
---
Can't sell for caps:   scrap, gift or drop  
---
Can't trade for legendary scrip:   sell.   If cap max already reached, hold onto it or gift it to someone.  If it's something made with legendary modules, you have to either hold onto it or drop it.  
---
Stash limit:  if you don't have FO1st, keep a minimum of scrap and bulk it.   IIRC, the bulk weighs less than the pieces individually.   Watch aid and miscellaneous items.  Unexpected weight can build up there.  
---
I hate the limits....find it pretty demoralizing to have 240 gb and only able to cash in 20 per day.
---
I mean, I like how it was done in NV. I stumbled across them and it felt really cool. First time i played the game, i didn't even find them. In 4, Auther became a little jerk and everything Lions shown him went out the window. 
---
But with 76, they just feel really shohorned in. Compare that to the Enclave, who had to be connected do to Greenbrier. Like the Enclave makes sense for being here. It makes sense to them to have alot of power right after the war. It makes sense that they have secret bases across America. Hell, Pre War military units should still be around in some form, and are if the Old Guard shows us anything.
---
But... Brotherhood. Ad victurm?
---
bloodied+unyielding is way off to everything else. But there is working fix for auto hp regen with speed daemon mutation on PTS, at least something. 
---
Game is already too easy, boosting everything to compare to bloodied make it not challenging at all. I dont know what their doing, but seems we ended up with everyone can one hit everything even SBQ.
---
nope, good dps, ap reduction + vats build + sneack build. damages x3.15
---
take a look :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RunhgkMt1Q0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RunhgkMt1Q0)
---
Also it made literally no sense for them to blow up the institute. The brotherhood would have realistically taken it over and stopped the synth operation, whilst still maintaining the other science advancements.
---
Yeah has he not been eating his meat? Where are those sweet gaines??
---
They should make him legendary and give him dual gutsy-guns. Would be funny to watch butthurt people try to smack him for revenge but then just get turned into Swiss cheese and be left humiliated.
---
Me and a friend once found the pipe next to Dyer Chemicals in the mire and to this day, we return to the same spot weekly in hopes of once again sniffing the pipe
---
I think they were okay in 3. Off shoot of the order who pretty much fell im love with the natives. Get it and understood... but then they did a 180 in 4 for no reason. Lions and anyone we would have known has died in the span of 20 years and went back to an odd hybrid of old and new Brotherhood.
---
It's okay, I forgive you for all the hurtful words. Let's hug it out, son, so that I might be able to sleep tonight.
---
I'm no mathematician, but 800 isn't quite "nothing" compared to 1600. Regardless, you seem to be missing or ignoring the original point I was making, which is that it's possible to massive damage to the queen without "magic" weapons. I shouldn't be able to take 15% of her health in 1 magazine, but here we are. That's not flexing, by the way, that's just saying that the game is broken, which everyone already knows. So why don't we both just walk away, hmm? Cheers.
---
You can bind it where you want ? I started FO76 recently and I thought favorite items were put where there is room on the wheel.
---
I share my resources with all. And you'd be surprised what people buy from my shop, it's like a limit I keep pushing and it cracks me up sometimes. I used to run a successful shop in FF14 so I know how to watch market trends.
---
In 3 they were cool, 4 really should have had Sarah as the elder and not some stupid flying steampunk boat as their base.
---
I feel like I'm the minority and while I mostly sided with the Institute or the Minutemen (I'm the fucking hero of the story, not that soab maxson), the Boston Wasteland is still a dangerous wasteland that is better to regulate with an intermediate and aggressive dictatorship than a wobbly democracy of settlements. If the focus is on a fast reestablishment of a prewar order, then yes, I would prefer a militaristic rule of the Brotherhood with all its possible atrocities. That being said, Elder Maxson is an angry, dumb asshole and deserves to burn with his stupid blimp.
---
My server wouldn't load both times my dailies autocompleted
---
That is crazy I can't believe that. Other then the magic weapons. This seems by far the best gun haha
---
I will try to do my best!
---
Some points are...
---
"I walk away from them".
---
IT'S LEGACY. Obliviously you will NEVER get it if you go away from were they are...
---
"None of the guys I regularly play with have such weapons, either. " i have hens but never seen any flying bird, birds don't fly...  No.
---
"I am feeling especially magnanimous " No.
---
"What are the odds of one of these weapons actually dropping? "
---
(hope you only talk about b2525 and not Explo plasma G.)
---
Its all good, i fell a lot better. Yeah, thats what i was thinking, thanks for the advice!
---
Got a bottle of wine by chance? 🤣 Need it for a Biv quest
---
I never understood the logic, and bethesda have never  (to my knowledge) addressed actually why they have so many caps on things so we speculate. Not sure about anyone else but all of the caps on things were the main reason my playtime significantly dropped. Farming legendaries and bullion is tedious enough without it being time capped.
---
You are safe, regularly aquired is no problem. And even if it was duped, Bethesda already said numerous times that they have limited to no way of tracking individual weapons.
---
Spotify. Fallout Radio.
---
It's got 300 songs from all the fallout titles, plus some new ones that fit the atmosphere.
---
Poor harambe bottom left :(
---
When I saw the outfit in the shop for the first time I knew I had to get it and become the Not-So-Pint-Sized Slasher. Tranquility Lane was just so much fun.
---
Thanks! See you in the wasteland too!
---
I've also used workshops to test build idees, so I don't mess up my camp. Did it a lot in the past, not so much recently. I've let my kids loose in workshops to build to their harts content. And I've had 1 PVP encounter for a workshop since launch. Maybe I've just been lucky? 
---
I just kept retaking the workshop, after he left the area. Retaking became the game for me, hiding, sneaking, quickly building defences. He gave up. He won the battles but I won the war while in passive mode all the time.
---
Imagine having timers every 20 hours for a whole year to minmax your game profit on currency that's next to worthless and on scrips that give you shit 99 times out of 100.
---
Oh sorry meant to say on the right side. And no problem
---
Negative. Drank it all. I have a wine bottle however.
---
Nah, I always been buying gold from him on Mondays, but lately I was on holidays and came back at Thursday last week. Bought gold without a problem, same that Monday.
---
And make him laugh while walking away. I love the robot laugh. Ha, ha, ha.
---
I'm sorry, the 'stupid blimp' comment made me laugh. Agreed. Honestly all of them weren't really governments in any sort, and would suck at ruling. And i couldn't take Maxson seriously with me remember making fun of him in Fallout 3 and the Deathclaw scar on his face.
---
I got one last week and almost wore it down to nothing until I realised they can’t be repaired. Now it sits safely in my stash box.
---
yes but in use, it's overpower like some other guns for 99% mobs in the game. you will feel the difference only on the queen. (i talk for most of b2525 /33/faster reload etc...) but yeah it's crazy :)
---
Legacy means that some people still have an item that has been removed from the loot pool, but not deleted from the entire game. In the initial phase of Fallout 76 exploding energy weapons (Expoloding Gattling laser for example) could be looted. Since a while back the explosive attribute can not appear on energy weapons any more. This makes those existing weapons legacy.
---
I'm not convinced that they don't test anything.  I think it's entirely possible that they test things, are fully aware that they do not work properly, and don't care enough to do anything about it.
---
I believe Luck affects the charge of looted cores. Higher luck = higher charge. I may be wrong though.
---
Happens to me all the time with the gatling laser too.
---
DO NOT WORRY HOOMAN, MEAT WEEK SOON. :)))
---
Oh okay, thank your for the info.
---
Should have been a fixed Rivet City. Damn, that would have been cool
---
Then you'd have to defrost stuff, quicker to get fresh...
---
You can collect ore as a bloodied; use the Chinese Stealth Suit, some Rad Shield, and have some diluted rad-away on hand.  Keep an eye on the bar.
---
Nice. 3 more and you can do an impression of Luther from The Warriors. 🤣👍
---
No thanks. I rather have a mule on separate account.
---
I run a 50cal heavy w an exlove Boucher shot gatlic. Bro I I feel like I’m playin the game as it should be playeded t. Old timer
---
Yes I had it a few times some months ago while I was actively farming it.
---
It might help if you are not having too much perk reducing weight and also have a lot of  free space left in inventory.
---
Being in a team helps you to travel back fast. Do a stash before the ISS event and you will lose almost nothing if this occurs.
---
And beware once it is down it will explode and may disappear so run and loot fast and escape immediately :D
---
I’d put it in my purified water defrost. But yeah I’d rather keep it frozen until I need it such as milk or something. 
---
Maybe add a function where there’s a cyan bar for defrost similar to the yellow bar for condition of foods.
---
Hah, no worries. I only started playing because I found the T51b Power Armor Helmet edition of the game for £30 and I wanted the helmet and not the game, but then a friend pressured me into trying it, and... well, here I am 140+ levels later. 😅
---
Good luck in the Wastelands, tiger. 👍🏻
---
If you want to develop workshops that much, you need to be on a private server.    We'll never be able to stop the pvp of workshops, although I wish we could.
---
Love this, especially the "Bathesda" part
---
Your post confused me at first.  Then I realised you're probably thinking of game modding, but the post is talking about armor mods that are in the base game.
---
Food is so abundant, like everywhere, dont waste your time, just play 76 as oppose to resource management 76, though some would argue that is 76 :-)
---
[Tunnel Snakes Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ximxe4XtU)
---
I tend to stay away from people now as this game has the most toxic playerbase I've ever seen. And atleast in my experience nobody wants to make friends anyways. But i do notice this as well. Im sure its just instanceing. They fill a server than another starts so noone new joins.
---
In the five weeks it’s been happening couldnt they have made the tools they need to give score out by now.
---
If they weren't harmful Bethesda wouldn't be banning/suspending people.
---
It's pretty par for the course. I don't want to throw out random percentages, but a very large amount of issues this game has had were due to copy-pasting. It's why rad-rats/wolves are so ridiculously tanky, it's why the handmade drum mag gave you a ridiculous amount of ammo until a few months back, it's why that update in early 2019 rolled back the previous update, it's why the .ini file has many pointless features like difficulty or autosave frequency. I could go on and on but I think you get the point - this isn't their first rodeo
---
Only plants that grow in the wild might give you fluxes, those planted in the camps won't, no matter if you drop bomb on them or spawn camp in the nuke-zone.
---
What are you talking about? 15% with one magazine is normal damage.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/one-pump-dan/video/88481535
---
Full health to dead in one magdump in that clip. I have a dozen different guns that can do this. You seem to really underestimate the power of proper builds and magic weapons.
---
The difference is that people try to argue that a b2525 can do this too, which is technically true but only when solo. You will never see a guy with a b2525 fixer killing the queen at a group event super fast because he relies on sneak attacks for dmg where the magic gun doesn't.
---
Either way, I quit playing this awful game months ago, I'm still waiting for the wendingo colossus before I log in again.
---
Nope. I turn them off.
---
Hell that was the main factor of me buying 76 in the first place. My friends and I were stoked to finally play a Fallout game together. Now I'm the only one that still plays, everyone quit in the first month.
---
I really love this!   
---
on number two. This!!!! we need this to happen.
---
Heh that is new to me I bought SS underarmor (from ATOM shop) to use it in NW I use the gold bullion shielded one on my commando.
---
Still It is strange.
---
EDIT: Is shadow prime silent helmet fixed?
---
wait.... there is cake?
---
I'm talking about Energy explosives in general not just that one, they were a rarity before but continuous duping made them more common.
---
I'm refusing to buy atoms now until they show they can release stuff that works.  
---
The legendary run has so many broken rewards.  The game has so many broken mechanics.
---
* New score system auto completes if you're logged in during reset.  Or not.  Bethesda have fallen silent on it.  Players are frustrated  they get no solution other than a paltry few score challenges.  Which defeats the object of they complete. 
---
* Ghillie armor is bugged to high heavens. 
---
* Camp module deactivates your camp from the map.  
---
* Fireworks affect reload speed and one guy was scolded by Bethesda for mentioning on the forums.
---
* Prefabs like the red rocket garage do not place right.  The door bugs out also.
---
* Secret service skin for the underarmor doesn't support modding 
---
* Workshops are bugged so you can't see who owns them.  Can't fast travel to a teamates workshop either.  This would make them actually viable and worth fighting over on the map.
---
* Commander dags questline is bugged where you retrieve the flight data and can't progress. 
---
* Lunchboxes.  The damn things they tried introducing during the vault raids, but players lost their cool.  Open too many and they remove the XP boost!  
---
I love this game.  I really really do.  But it's getting tedious and frustrating seeing the basics of testing being ignored.  I hope Bethesda can respond the community to show they are listening.  The community here is one of the best I've come across in gaming.  They are very fortunate to have a player base which despite the bugs, support the game.
---
It happens with one of my lasers aswell.
---
If its a 90% reduced weight , then it is a golden... good for that burried quest.
---
Correct.   And from behind if possible.
---
I disagree with this
---
I like them to add some building item from Conan exiles. I mean the triangle peices that allow us to make circle and other things. It's somthing that could easily be added in.
---
Bruh the whole entire gaming community has been warning you guys about how Bethesda has absolutely bamboozled the fuck out of the fallout fan base. Over promised a game that’s still using a single players engine for a “mmo” (recipe for disaster btw lol). They don’t test back shit. Hell they even called their “beta” a 
---
Break
---
Everything
---
Test
---
Application
---
I expected fallout76 to be like No Mans Sky without the effort to actually fixing their game lol.
---
The NW version lasers are the ones getting commonly duped now because they are better than real legacies. They ignore damage caps in pvp
---
It can´t be repaired?
---
Definitely Soon\^TM
---
I wonder... How bad (worse) the game would actually have to be for these people to stop paying and defending it?
---
Corn, mutfruit and tato for starch.  Razorgrain for the brahmin and to make alcoholic beverages.   Blackberries for the booze too.     I don't bother with carrots because I don't make anything with them, and I don't care about the small reward from the grilling event.   I used to have gourds until I became tired of making cranberry relish.  
---
I wish we could plant anything we can harvest from the wild.
---
According to other reddit posts yeah
---
I lost faith when they announced what Nuclear Winter actually was going to be. Still here though. Captivated and too exhausted to complain.
---
I want that fridge that is leaving in 6 days!
---
[](/ktrixiebandit)I would love this. I'm still holding out hope for a raider ally myself. This cryptid hunter radio nerd they dressed up in raider garb isn't fooling me for a second.
---
That's awesome!!!
---
They see most of what people talk about, they just don't act on it. We've seen many times in the past that it doesn't matter whether or not people are insistent, they just pick and choose seemingly randomly which things to focus on. The only "pattern" we had was that they pretty consistently patched out anything that gave players a big advantage pretty quickly. But we are now multiple months into reputation exploits being publicly known, as well as the ""magic"" weapons having their own market at this point. A year ago, we would have expected both of those to be fixed within a week of them becoming public
---
10 or more ultracite plasma cores with 10-50 rounds left in them at all times 💀
---
Tried playing  the game again couple weeks ago with the settlement update upon  loading everything  seemed well teleported to a settlement  and got my body flig across the whole map and i then ended up falling under the map then dying after this im like ok mabey  its a one time nahh I die by falling out of the map again I tell ya this game is garbage and completely  scattered  with bugs deleted  the game completely and the launcher since i dont want that kind of stuff on my computer
---
Big Yes
---
All those partially depleted cores say that this is definitely not just a visual bug.
---
I'm afraid it is either down to pure luck, crafting, or buying it from someone.
---
thats shitty
---
lol no, a handful of cheaters got their accounts wiped but it seems like the majority got let off on a "final warning". Even with multiple hacked weapons like beam splitter recon handmades, nuke miniguns, 10mm auto sniper rifles. They probably stopped caring because they know it's far too late to fix what they allowed to happen
---
[](/wubmepls)A ladder down the cliff on the very edge of my camp zone that people always spawn at so they can get to my camp without climbing the damn thing. There isn't enough space down there to make a staircase up, sadly.
---
It just fireworks
---
Man, i move every 3 days or so. get bored of a place fast and love building. I don´t have the willpower to stay in one place.
---
You talk in hyperbole &amp; sound so emphatic “100% believable”, “beyond talking to”.
---
We believe that a weapon gives you an extra agility, armour that makes you invisible when you crouch etc, is it a stretch that fireworks can impact your reload speed.
---
It’s not as obvious or as emphatic that this is an exploit as you are suggesting.
---
Not all of us were invited to the firework meeting at Bethesda that you obviously chaired.
---
There are some well known dupes, weapons that have hundreds/thousands of copies circulating around on their given platform. The same condition bar, same 3* effects, and yet many people will tell you they got it as a legit drop. The only way you know nowadays is if you got it yourself. If you are receiving anything high tier in a trade or from a vending machine, you should be going under the assumption that it's a cheated item because that is far more likely than the alternative
---
lmao, as there was always logic behind Bethesdas actions.
---
They were taken out of the game cause they are kind of op (but also shitty at the same time) and they didn't work properly.
---
Bethesda banned people for duping,  not for duping particular legacies
---
Marsupial and speed demon are always the ones that sell out first for me.
---
The building Limitations suck dick
---
This: Bethesda's BOS  has a very "boots" culture to it &amp; a lot of people eat that up
---
Yeah if I was true Min-Max I'd probably need the Raider shielded for PER and AGI. But given Beth can randomly end Adrenaline and have a simple CAMP skin make the whole thing disappear a single PER point doesn't mean shit. Seriously I can't keep up with what correctly stacks and works, and what's still busted.
---
Whenever he refuses to speak to you/sell gold.
---
Hop servers, enter Wayward, enter dialogue with the Duchess, back out then speak so smiley, always works then :-)
---
Oh right yeah forgot about the fridge yeah I picked that up as well.
---
My theory is that the BoS coming to Appalachia are a splinter group recruited from nearby by Knight Moreno (who is not confirmed dead afaik) or someone like him. A strike force coming from Mariposa would be among the dumbest decisions Bethesda has ever made.
---
I use unyielding armor and low hp to craft overcharged ultracite plasma cores. You can get 325+ shots per core.
---
I never really used this perk. Can you assign which grenade it’s gonna use, or does it take one randomly from your inventory?
---
Oh nice thanks for the info, gotta try that FOR SCIENCE

A 'zone in here' mat you can place where desired.

A jukebox that plays anything but classical.

Wallpaper on both sides of a wall without having to use tricks.

Ability to transfer items to shelves (without using tricks)

Option to lock the 'place camp' button in pipboy so I'm not constantly pulling it up by mistake when trying to scroll.

The only reason I’m aware of the whole ‘3* enemies having a CHANCE to drop 3* legendaries’ is from reading it from another user on here. I could be wrong but I never saw that clarified in the game and tbf I don’t think it should be wrong to assume that if an enemy have 3*s it should be dropping 3*s.
---
That was a week ago. You took the wrong picture
---
Pretty sure that this is intended because otherwise you wouldn't have to spend the gold to get the plans for the underarmor.
---
Yeah, I’ll always remember fondly when I first discovered the Enclave in 76 or when I first got to the Institute in 4. I love the surprise factor with the factions. And it makes super sense that the Enclave is powerful and out there 20 something years after the fallout. If they’ll include Bos in 76, it better be something like their origin story, they should be in their raw state. But I feel like they’ll just show up with their strong power armors, and tear up the place syaing they’re here to help. But, unfortunately, if their inclusion could make 76 better and fun, they’re always welcomed (with limits of course).
---
That actually is true... sadly.
---
I used to like this game but this is one of the main reasons I don't play anymore.
---
Doh  XD
---
No Sir, you are no jerk. Your post reminds me of silly times two years... one year... o... ok just somewhere now, jerks, jerks never changed. Also, maybe they wanted your wife off the server, so it's retribution.
---
The truth can hurt sometimes.
---
But if u have the plans for the under armour and the mods u should be able to mod it, given the secret service camo skin is litteraly a skin u can put on ur ss armour u have already and u don't have to craft a full new set like u do with the under armour even tho the camo is still just a skin
---
That´s unfortunately the mentality. I wish it would change. And i think we need it to change as a species. The Investment banking and stock market is wildly unregulated and anti Long term sustainable companies. I think no other sector has had as much freedom as they have.
---
u/ladydevann is bgs aware of this?
---
Yes. As in the F:NV, one special weapon/armor as a result of some quest/treasure hunt. It is much more lore-friendly...
---
If you swap weapons quick, it won't reload and you can just switch back :) it's annoying but that's how I have worked around it
---
Just found this out the hard way, by making the dark matter skin, and then switching it to normal and then back to dark matter. Goodbye cobalt flux LOL.
---
No. They have auto-filtered it...
---
Bubblesbin the white spring resort or the hoarders house in morgantown
---
I've noticed the scorchbeast doesn't spawn when the events in the Mire, every other time its appeared before I've even started the trap.
---
Arent 3-star enemies are supposed to be *same* rare?
---
But this is a very interesting topic. Nice post, have my upvote!
---
Why would they bother when you dumbasses keep throwing money at them?
---
I'm pretty sure there was a reply from the community manager people that they were looking into the skins for the fixer. Possibly making combat skins work on it
---
It is, i agree
---
I'll have a look to see if I have a spare.
---
350 is the max I've been able to get from ult plasma cores
---
Dang. I guess I am alone in this 😅
---
FYI. Was digging around the game files to see if there was anything new re pets to be found.. Turns out random spawning Behemoths can be tamed!?
---
God bless you Zachy you've given me hope!!
---
:-)))
---
Yeah I agree. I was just saying why it doesn't work because it is seen as an item an not a paint, although it should be a paint.
---
On PC each of these slots on the favorite wheel has a hotkey.  You can fav whatever stim you want and use its hotkey.  I believe this is why all the PC players are confused
---
best part is, we grinding best legendary for our characters and basically never get it, only option is buying from some duper. Game is so broken and punish normal playing and glorifying exploits. Its soooo random , tons of junk items and 90% of map is lower level npcs. Ended up clearing only few locations with +50lvl npcs and hoping for 3start and god roll from 999items. I dont do the math but i think its nearly impossible and boring. In the end you even dont know what to do with tons of useless legendary items because scrip/caps cap is too low....
---
Wow, angry about it aren't we? I was asking for clarification, no need to get huffy. Sheesh.
---
Here's hoping for a quick fix
---
Thanks :)
---
It sounds like the later but we will see.
---
Don't buy yet it's bugged.
---
What?
---
Mods don't work on it. At present
---
The glass sided camper is proof of that. It was rereleased with them knowing full well the sides have no collision and can be walked through.
---
The Red Rocket garage was released in a bundle originally that was pulled a short time after because it had the wrong fucking door and now its released separately months later with the right door but its busted. Ridiculous
---
Its a random encounter and suppose to be spooky
---
Added to the “one of many bugs that need fixing in Fallout 76” 
---
Damn this list is getting rather LONG.
---
Ask for a refund because they KNEW that was broken but rereleased it anyway. They are knowingly selling a faulty product.
---
I have the actual SS underarmor and it works fine but this would have been a nice addition :)
---
How? I'm genuinely curious. I'm no veteran hardcore grinder but I am lvl 250 without any exploits whatsoever which does take a fair while of play time. Not once have I ever been "pulled into pvp" or expereinced any kind of grief at all. I think maybe I went to a guys camp once and he had a few punji boards around. GG griefers are a massive issue I guess?
---
If you die and the event finishes while you're dead you won't be able to respawn and will have to go back to home screen. Just try not to die at the end of the event
---
sometimes multiple cores are loaded for the energy Gatling weapons so when I've runs out, it plays the reload animation to "load" the next one, a quick sprint will cancel the reload animation
---
But it's *not* fixed.  A fix is *being tested*.  To see if it *actually* fixes it.
---
Old Wallpaper. I want my home to have old, worn down look. Not like it just came off the shopping channel.
---
More factions set. You already did two. Your adding more next season for BoS. Your missing one....
---
Robots. Love the protectron,  but let me have my Mr. Handy for my home of the future!
---
There’s a vendor in Whitesprings resort that sells all of the flavors except for the cranberry one I believe
---
Must be fun playing video games as a time traveler from the future.
---
Would watch put for explosive bait though heard it can destroy camps as its counted a s environmental damage
---
This works great, u can also glitch the weapon mags. Going between gatling gun and fixer while reloding getting 250 rounds for the fixer. Works the other way too tho.
---
The point of testing is for it to work properly?
---
Neither side of the argument can know for a fact that Bethesda does testing but the argument that they don’t if far more compelling when it’s all broken when released.
---
What system are you on? If you're on PS4, I could just craft any piece you need.
---
Try behind the school. More creatures get as the match goes longer. Stay away from the city center and you will see them.
---
Ah. That makes more sense.
---
The sad thing is those are just the issues that came out with this patch. There are still various issues that have been out for months with no patch or mention its getting fixed. 
---
Hell, there are some that have been in game since release.
---
When i posted about this earlier i juist had dicks telling me to use the damn search funciton because apparently its a common issue.
---
I'm convinced its a ploy by Bugthesda to make you buy atoms to finish the legendary run
---
5 playable characters. I just switch when limits are reached. It is actually a good feeling because this means all my scrip, caps and bullion are done for that character and the next day  the scrip will  probably be easy since most of it is already in stash.  
---
Sometimes I mule stuff around to scrip but most of the time I just wait until the next day.   
---
If your characters are all different build, it is actually nice to be able to play different builds. Just don't expect to reach all the limits on all the characters each day, because that will burn you out very fast and make the game feel like a chore. On those rare weekend days I can accomplish it, it is a nice feeling though.
---
&gt; SFE 
---
???
---
I wish there was a Collectron version for your CAMP that "collected" insults.
---
They'd probably have to experience one of their characters getting randomly deleted or items randomly disappearing. Or their account getting locked and not having access to it for a month.
---
I remember Ubisoft gave the entire first season 1 rewards away for anyone who played during breakpoint’s launch. I gave up on this run, and hopefully bethesda does the same. If not, i’ll just cut my losses and move on to another game.
---
When I hit max scrip I normally buy modules don't can earn more scrip. When I hit max cap hit the vendors in whitesprings, to learn plans I don't know then sell them stuff to the caps back. Presently I'm grinding ever event for the rare out fit drops.
---
Meanwhile I just can’t find it in the build menu, I’m either blind or fucking stupid....
---
Probably both
---
Thanks bro! That was my go to spot for this challenge, well that and VTU - but after an hour of no spawns I had to walk away or risk chucking my laptop out my apartment window. Games used to be fun, I think.
---
Haha. Imagine not having 30x B/25/25 Fixers like this chump who doesn't like exploits.
---
I think they're talking about when you fast travel and it's "open" but the door is physically closed. So you hit "open" to open it but suprise, the door was actually open just bugged. So now you have to watch it close after you hit open,  just so you can open it. When it should just stay open.
---
Yes they can be any star. And as long as you know the plan she can drop them
---
+karma
---
its in the Resources menu
---
I imagine the past two weeks have been "filler" and that, if things still go according to plan, next week will be a more impressive update alongside the big Patch.
---
True. Try to just move around in the woods. If you are still, they are less likely to spawn
---
It's *extremely* debatable whether it can be called an 'exploit' in any worthwhile sense.  The item is meant to be equipped.  If you equip it, even in full knowledge of the unintended benefits, then you're doing exactly what was intended.
---
Problem many have, just add it to the mountain of bugs
---
If you’re on Xbox one I can craft you the missing piece
---
My responder character might need some help in raiding vault 79 in the future. He's still level 23 at this moment 😅
---
weird flex, but okay
---
I’ve had 1 bear arm drop from her, and it was a 3 star bloodied. Good luck!
---
Not sure if this is how it's meant to work, but I find a lot are empty but later fill up, so between waves you have to check them all again.
---
I also mostly sneak to get sneak crits, and this can prevent them from emerging. If you run around on the spot or shoot (with an unsilenced weapon) this tends to bring them out to play.
---
well definitely spooky. 
---
If it's anything like the mannequins i found while searching for crates in the waterlogged area during Riding Shotgun. That got me good
---
I couldn't agree more on this, I mean, if they can do a fixed reset for settler/raider rep dailies, they should be able to do it for vendor and scrip as well. At least they should keep the game consistent...
---
He means playernames like "156asdfedrtz234asdf" - I have seen quite a few such names, also asking myself how it came to be.
---
&gt; A strike force coming from Mariposa would be among the dumbest decisions Bethesda has ever made. 
---
**"1st Expeditionary Force, this is L-H (Lost Hills) with a recorded Priority Gamma message.**
---
**Papa Romeo (Paladin Rahmani) missed the last four check-ins.** ***No contact since crossing the Rockies.*** **Scribes estimate unit position in the vicinity of Lincoln.** ***Orders are to re-establish comms with L-H (Lost Hills)*** **ASAP and provide a full report of whereabouts and activities since last communication."**
---
All signs point to them coming from Lost Hills.
---
Does seem like I find less when actually looking for them lol.
---
I always just spawn with my ass to the flames at the bottom of the map and wander the woods east to west when looking for creatures.  Ignore trying to get to safety and just search the woods while avoiding the fire.  Took me about 5 minutes but I found 3, last one was a Grafton monster I ran into the storm to get.
---
Why? Seems like a hassle for no given reason
---
We definitely need some more unique events, we have unique events but after a few times they’re a bit boring, we need brand new events that aren’t just shoot enemy or guard target.
---
Events brighten up the gameplay a lot and if we had a load of new ones it would make it a lot more enjoyable
---
Maybe they should just leave it as it is, since it's better now.
---
yep ofc :))
---
&gt;Anyone else annoyed by this?
---
No, I prefer it like this - not everything has to be exclusively for US timezones.
---
I save an extra nuke card just for griefers..... Nice base near whitesprings sir.... Shame if someone wanted to farm fluids...
---
It isn't a visual bug because if you cancel the reload by switching weapons and going back to that gun you can still fire the remaining rounds. With the gatling Laser anyway I can't speak for the other weapons
---
Im lvl 60 and ive had the game since closed beta. I pre ordered kind of sadly but the only pvp i ever do is  with me and my friends there have a been a few times when people randomly attack me like in a nuke zone but for the most part not much pvp for me
---
Marsupial
---
Im still after my first, untold thousands of scrip spent. Tempted to do 1 stars for the sake of efficieny, just to get 1 to drop bc I'm beginning to believe it's impossible
---
Just a week or two? That's a bit optimistic.
---
FREEDOM FROM THE CAPS !!!
---
Or at least a daily reset timer tab in the pip boy that show vendor caps script and bullion
---
Yeah I was running around like a headless chicken ready to punch any spawns to death before a NW regular could zero in on my tail and make a miserable experience even more so. If it was just kill one creature in NW I’d give it another shot, but as it stands they can f* right off. It’s not even mid day yet and I’m ready for my first Gin :P
---
To be fair I wasn’t looking for one and I didn’t actually want it at the time. It sat in a display for about 6 months until I converted one of my toons to a bloodied melee build. 
---
Now, with the piercing mod it does 1700 damage :)
---
And don't forget the steel bungalow... I can literally walk through the windows of that shit... I can't believe they are selling that shit on atomic shop lol
---
Understable. Try the side of the main mountain. The northern part has some. Other then that, sorry mate. I hate NW too.
---
Enclave are the reason WV is the way it is. Without them, there’d be people alive - Reaponders, Free States, BoS, the lot.
---
As to why we get the BoS, it’s not like there’s many others factions they can use from other games, they don’t exist yet.
---
I’m sure we’ll get the Enclave in time, as well as more Foundation/Crater stuff. Getting the BoS now (well, soon) doesn’t exclude others later.
---
I thought it was my loading times that did that :))) it's  funny now.
---
Only happens to me with ultracite Gatling laser
---
It's interesting.
---
I've been playing since release and I have yet to experience a third of the problems that all of you seem to experience every 10 minutes.
---
Nice, it’s great if the stars align like that! Spawned into Flatwoods in one of the games today and did exactly as you described. Nothing.
---
At this juncture this game is a very casual mmo. If you’re playing more than three hours a day, I think that’s gonna not be so great.
---
nope you are not a jerk at all lol.
---
It happened to me several times. Already sent a ticket and got a reply as follows:
---
We appreciate your report of this incident and will hand the details off to the development team for review.
---
In this quest I realize that if you instantly loot the caches, you miss some goodies so act slowly when you point to the caches. This does not solve the "no loot bug" but let you loot if there are any goods in boxes.
---
As for the second issue  it just shows the creatures underground. When you go closer to them, they rise to surface.
---
Other people can't take your stuff from it. Its like your stash box
---
Cheers, really appreciate the solid advice - and hopefully somebody else will too!
---
huh, interesting, I remember someone attacked me with a grenade launcher and I did drop some hp
---
Future Commies, all of them.
---
And its not the living thing I have issue with. Its more that the Brotherhood is here.... in WV... of all places. And that our future is full of BoS content for a long time. I love the BoS but there such as too much of a good thing. They already are one of the most feasted out factions and have alot of gear in game.
---
Get FO 1st for unlimited super easy mode.
---
You don't need another character or mule unless you want to hoard.
---
There is a whole lot to do. Caps, scrip, and stash limit only limits you if you can't see the plethora of stuff waiting for you to do and discover.
---
Tis the same old hand holding complaint again.
---
&gt;They also leech off of settlements to survive **or they’ll kill them**
---
Just to knitpick, they don't murder settlers for refusing to supply them. That's an evil option that the player has, for a quartermaster breaking regs (you can ask him if its an sanctioned op and he will be evasive), that Danse will be utterly disgusted (iirc) with you for if you opt for it in his company. Letting your dislike of a faction and their genuine sins make you took at them darkly from every angle is how fanon happens.
---
Awesome, thanks mate
---
Yeah i agree. You don´t need to have everything. But i think the scrap-box should be free. I feel bad thinking about all the people trying to do inventory management without it.
---
If the currency is next to worthless and scrips are shit, why are so many of you worried about potentially missing some?
---
Its like being angry that your stomach is full so there is no more room to eat. And its unsalted popcorn.
---
The fridges act the same as a display cases and vendor machines. Items are in your personal stash but flagged as beloging to the fridge
---
Not sure won’t be loading in till I finish all my weeklys to avoid the challenges completion bug(well one of the ways)
---
Six months, give or take, yes - taking us just past the two year anniversary.
---
Or if they test it they just won't fix it coz they have to roll out new broken shit to get money out of gullible low-standard people. I've been pestering Dev teams over big errors in their work a lot but the leaders/management just say it's not a priority as long as the thing kinda works..
---
You’re not certain. I and many others are.
---
How desperate are you to defend your fence sitting ways? Even downvoting my comments? Sad.
---
I wish they'd put that in the atom shop
---
What really annoys me is the “door bug”, when a door appears closed, only you it “open” it, causing it to close again, happens a lot with the Red Rocket garage door from the Atomic Shop, it’s ridiculous.
---
Is it also considered exploiting when your jetpack doesn't show up randomly? Cause that happens sometimes, more often than not actually. I have no control over if I'm going to be able to see my SS jetpack when I enter a world. Next thing you know Bethesda is gonna ban people for this because it's "not what they intended" smfh I wish they would start banning more people that would mean less money for them and it might make people wake up and realize Bethesda is shady as fuck.
---
If everything isn’t one cap I have an absolute melt down and break all your stuff cuz I’m garbage. Cool story
---
You can't transfer from xbox to pc. Even using game pass
---
Imagine of brotherhood questline require you to not have any mutation. What an epic outrage IT would be here. Btw i admire you i have also tryed to not use any mutation but after trying speed demon and the one for jumping i could not Play without them.
---
The ammo converter is both great and sucks at the same time.
---
Yikes, Huge shame as basically ever other game available on the xbox beta app does. (literally haven't found one that doesn't tbh). Is it even worth it for me to restart? I haven't played since before wastelands and fallout 1st was even announced.
---
I've never gotten one, nor a sheepsquatch staff, and I've only ever gotten two relatively lame fixers. It's like playing the lottery, I tell you. You know it's never going to happen, but it has happened before, so maybe today is my day. 
---
Just curious, I've heard that learned wastelanders plans can also drop, but what other plans are there?
---
I'm all for factions being here if it makes sense... but i would have rather had The Thunder just being a US army unit (Maybe just called 'The Thunder' or ' Tagery Rangers' ) then making them brotherhood. And I overall agree with you point that it shouldn't be either or, but with all the BoS stuff in game, plus more stuff from the Atlas Mission, and more from the Next two season, its just a BoS overflow of stuff. Cool, but i rather see some other stuff for a bit.
---
Bethesda announced a rework for the converter a few weeks ago, props to the madlads who are bothering with it in its current form but I think soon\* it will be much more intuitive.
---
If you didn't enjoy the game much before you probably won't enjoy it now. They really havnt added that much new content.
---
I myself still get a lot of enjoyment out of the game, but it's all about you
---
Oh I definitely hear ya.  Today, have to search everywhere to find any.  Yesterday morning every match I played ghouls and hounds kept swarming me while I was trying to stay hidden, usually multiples at once. Wtf.
---
can you have this plus the ice box, or can you use only one item at a time?
---
Pretty sure you can have several
---
I thought it had potential but i had issues with the grinding and legendaries (and inventory/stash space). Also bugs. if that stuff is better lmk and i may return
---
That’s something I normally would do, but I’m trying a low int character since it’s usually high for me
---
The rest area above rippers alley usually has some.
---
I mean, with Bethesda's writing history I don't exactly trust them to write an engaging new faction either. At least BOS was sort of fleshed out for them already so not much to fuck up there (not for a lack of trying).
---
When the gameplay is good enough then people don't mind doing something over and over again.
---
Why do you think WoW is still the best MMO out there? It's not because it has some revolutionary content. In fact it has grinds and fetch quests like any other MMO. WoW simply plays better than any other MMO, so for many the grind isn't that bad.
---
The same in 76. For many the gameplay is good enough (and also the world is great) to not mind the grind too much.
---
And thats insane. There first mission away from there  bunkers.... was to WV.
---
I'm done collecting ores on public servers unless the majority of participants is in our group. I'm no longer completing this event so selfish players get all the rewards while I get practically nothing.  
---
And I suspect many (ex-) ore collectors feel the same. Succes rate on public servers will keep dropping because less and less people will be collecting ore.
---
Not sure when you left but stash is now up to 800. The 3 big bugs are the fast travel bug (I don't get that one often), respawn bug (if you die right when an event ends you can't respawn), and the trade glitch. As for grinding, the only new content they really added was another grind haha
---
They have shown multiple times that they prioritize fun over lore and will retcon stuff. The super mutants for example.
---
I think the responders were  alright. The Free States were... not bad but very little data on them, and all there stuff is on the Atomic shop. Enclave are... kinda cartoon villains at this point, whitch sucks.
---
Not only Purveyor may give you Bear Arm - apparently all gear that is locked behind the new plans (Secret Service armor, bow and compound bow, plasma caster, gauss pistol, gauss shotgun and gauss minigun, Gauntled, Cattle Prod as well as Fixer, Bear Arm, Sheepsquatch club and staff) can be obtained also as a reward for Fasnacht event (not currently active) and as a reward for ally dailies. The only requirement is that you must know the plan for it.
---
Where do you get bear arm plan?  I may have it already but at work and can’t check 😂
---
for the ice box it only says 1/1. pretty sure it wont let me build multiple. I will double check when I am off work. Fridge looks cooler though, so may pick up anyway
---
Well that’s like 997less bugs than I used to be able to name that ruined the game for me so I may give it a try. It’s already downloaded anyway lmao
---
You act like this is new. Bethesda games are some of the buggiest games ever when they come out. I'm not sure if they have released one without big bugs. For a studio of their size it's very disappointing. 
---
Then you see someone like Rockstar - when you play their games you know they have tested the fuck out of it before releasing.
---
I mean I'm sure there's others, but those are the big ones that I still see. But yeah give it another go. Not like you've got much to lose
---
Thanks for confirming they'll think about it - it's pretty lame all mods work on both weapons while paint can only be applied on weapon most don't use (especially when have better Fixer).
---
Dont trust him, hes really a sadistic robot controlled by sky net. This git callously got me killed once by deciding to give me 100 pre money just as a nuke was about to hit where I was trying to find a legendary body, couldn't fast travel as it just pushed me over the limit
---
The time they spent bishing to you and others for mentioning this bug, should have been spent FIXING the bug.
---
yeah, i remember bugs that allowed people to rob your inventory if they traded you, items disapearing, people being able to rob your safe box thingy, etc. sounds much better. Thanks for the help :)
---
Nocturnal shovel must be good for graverobbing... ;-)
---
I'ts not hard to work out, but it is a bit of a button basher, and some times you can get stuck in an infinity loop if your not careful :)
---
It’s a bit glitchy and obviously a full week has to elapse.  I just do it every Monday and works ok.
---
I submitted the ticket and they responded quite quickly after that, but in the response they asked for stuff I already told them about (when it happened, the exact name of the item and the amount of atoms spent on it). I responded to them answering their questions via email but they haven’t responded yet. Did it happen to you as well? Thanks! :)
---
holy shit these are amazing
---
Then why do you want to play it?
---
But is it fun? I mean, we been with the Brotherhood in every game. Supermuntants in kinds get and except. Med Tek was using FEV to clear the new plague, makes sense that they would have other research labs. I am not aganist reconnting or making changing stuff for fun. But the BoS seeming to be there main draw for every game/ issue is annoying, and it gets insane with the backflips they do to make them fit into this game. I understand if you don't feel the same, and I won't lie saying it would be cool to see them. However, it just stinks that Brotherhood was the only people Bethesda could think of to use for the forseable future even if it makes little bloody sense.
---
Not worth the trouble.
---
I've gotten several instances of each sheepsquatch weapon, but never the first bear arm
---
Those are harmless, be careful if you'll see bag full of Fixers or Gatling Plasma or other stuff "too good to be true" - you might be banned ;)
---
I dont think it work like that... does it?
---
Doesn't work, only for workshops.
---
Always happens with my bloodied lmg, every bloody time
---
That’s hilarious mate, and I can totally relate. When we had the deploy CAMP objective I had critters spawning out of my wazoo and right off the bat too! 
---
In all seriousness though, it’s little issues like these that make me want to play less of the game, as a whole. A never ending and growing list of bugs and absolute sh!te RNG translates into aversion for me, not the will to grind. I have the deepest respect for players having put up with this since release, I simply do not have the balls for it!
---
These are great. Good job!
---
It says it does
---
Now that you mention it the same thing happened to me with becket and Jen, I’m like WTF are you people talking about!! I literally saved everyone. I use unyielding armor so I passed all the charisma checks and everyone was alive, but after the vault raid Jen said she was going to travel to  bury her mom where her dad is buried. I can’t remember what becket said but he was acting like we murdered his little brother, idk what’s up with that
---
Typical bethesda
---
A real bunker in the ground. Maybe it will be added with the instanced camps. Even a half good looking concrete structure would be nice.
---
Project paradise if u keep 2 or 3 critters alive
---
After wasting an hour, I can’t but agree mate.
---
"as question inquires"
---
what about adrenal reaction?
---
It used to early on but they changed it
---
I feel like the flying thing didn't even make sense, like how the fuck is that thing even operational 🤦‍♂️
---
Mabey shoot a mini nuke at it the damage might kill him if you have one
---
Zenimum
---
my interpretation: "fix ur game bethesda".
---
it is not my fault that i shoot enemies through walls using vats. and super accuracy and range for shotguns is beyond my understanding.
---
It's cheaper and easier to use them, rather than something new. The models are already in game, and their whole shtick of preserving technology makes it easy to write fetch quests. Dont expect anything innovative basically.
---
I will be, around 8PM EST
---
Gt BushMo0kie
---
I don’t think people were ever able to rob your stash on Xbox...

To be fair, if this sort of stuff was a deal breaker, you would have given up on this game a long time ago.
---
That´s my dream gun.
---
big pp
---
I’ve always wanted a full settlement style camp.
---
House for myself, crafting building, bar/tavern, farm area, motel style building for passerby, shop and a outdoor/indoor musical instrument area with a wall around it all.
---
I’ve been holding off on buying fallout 1st till they add the expanded camp options just so I can finally have the camp I want.
---
I just walked from edge of map inward and found 3
---
He can't, Gauss Minigun can't roll with explosive affix. At least legit way...
---
Bah! I'm guessing people were exploiting it by using it to trap or kill other players. This is why we can't have cool things!
---
Yeah, and i want to be beautiful. But we can't have everything we want can we.
---
Like a billion. Just to show off xD I just did my atom challenges every week when they were a thing but I almost never buy anything.
---
It was in the BETA, but even then was abused to trap/kill players, so was removed. 
---
As much as I would like to have one, there are just enough a-holes in this game to make it a bad idea.
---
I do believe they are legacy now,I managed to buy one yesterday, gave 20k caps &amp; 20k ultracite 556. To give you an idea of what the value is, I'm on ps4 though
---
I too turn them off.
---
Turn everyone one on every single dam time. Not only do I like the music I  also like the image it gives me of some streamer/youtuber scrambling to turn it off before it gets picked up by copyright 😂
---
Not sure why I find it so funny. I love livestreamers and youtubers.
---
The scout masks and the three jumpsuits drop from events in the savage divide. 0.02% chance. But if you get 1, you get them all. All 5 drop together
---
I have  never built in whitesprings and never will. Why would there be a brick house or a warehouse on hole 9?
---
Yeah the inventory steal glitch is gone. Was fixed a week or 2 after it was made public. And the npcs stealing items was also fixed pretty darn quick
---
I'm starting to think there are more bugged rewards than functioning ones.
---
Ouch that is pricey. But at this stage it's probley somthing I'd consider. Cheers for the reply.
---
Bravo.
---
You can't get them from enclave event anymore - now it's a part of the "bundle reward" for events from Savage Divide - you'll get all jumpsuits (BoS, White Powder, Mechanics, Whitespring) and both Enclave Masks (Forest and Urban). My alt have been rewarded that set few weeks ago from Uranium Fever, but earlier I also get those from Guided Meditation.
---
Nah! Curie likes them and she has unique dialog with Ingram if you do the Mass Fusion quest with BoS and with Curie as a companion.
---
Seriously? I thought all enclave events had a chance. You know. It would kinda make sense 😂.
---
Ill keep a eye on any and all events that pop in tha region now. Cheers mate.
---
Cant upvote this enough - this is btw not restricted to bethesda - most game companies handle it that way.
---
94% of players disagree it would seem.
---
Thanks man.
---
That makes it even worse. I do UF and GM every time It pops up and I have since I started my end game grind 😂. This is going to take forever.
---
Does it work as a single person in a public
---
group?
---
Not entirely true - I've been rewarded that plan for just one friendly animal alive - it's just chances to get rarest rewards are higher with all 3 alive.
---
Is it just public events or the other kind of events too. With such a small drop rate I want to make sure I do everything possible to increase my chances
---
Why do you think Bethesda keeps adding new prototype/experimental prewar PA all the time too? It's because people eat that shit up lmao
---
Yeah.... I know sadly.
---
With some weapons if you watch closely I think what may happen is it does go to 0 and as you reload it might say you have 30 or 40 or 50 ammo but that's just while doing the reload animation. I am not saying this is the case for all weapons and some may have bugs but I think i recall this happening with one of my tesla rifles. It would show 16 ammo remaining but only when reloading but it still fired down to zero (it's a quad tesla so it has 60 in the chamber).
---
Yes it does for some reason, it’s such a great mutation for the new public teams
---
It's not visual, but my weapon is always empty before it occures. It also drains bullets from the inventory and puts them into the gun. So, one can say it is actually not reloading too early, but magically partially reloading your gun, before the actual reload happens.
---
Pacifist mode won't help you in workshops. In fact it'll be a detriment most of the time. No matter what your status is, if you own the workshop others can engage in PvP with you. If you have pacifist on, this will mean they can damage you, but you won't be able to damage them until you turn pacifist mode off. 
---
If you can keep them away, eventually they'll get bored and stop trying to claim the workshop. But it might take 10-15 kills depending on what the aggressor is trying to do, whether that be wanting the workshop resources or to just straight up kill you.
---
Honestly it'll be faster for you to grind 1650 gold bullion and buy V94 mask from V79 vendor - it's a forest mask with additional strangler vines and it looks better (in my opinion) that plain Forest Scout mask. You may also try to get it from trading subreddit or discord, but it's a rare item, so I wouldn't count people will let it go for caps...
---
Great, thank you!
---
Yes sir. GL man
---
Bethesda's QA team have always been one of the worst in the business. Every single game Bethesda makes has masses of bugs glitches and other BS. Every single one, without exception.
---
I don't get why folk are still surprised when they buy a Bethesda game and find it's screwy or doesn't work. They are bad devs who make poorly assembled games. Consistently.
---
If you like these, you might like my gallery where full versions are available to download:  [https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery)
---
Amazing!
---
I've got the gold but I hate the vine look. Wish we could just buy a plain version.
---
Er Maybe they release the Thanksgiving display cabinet on a dunno thanksgiving ?, and the Santa one on Xmas ?
---
Thanks for stating the obvious.
---
Might I point out one further obvious thing? I wrote that I was tempted to, not that I am offering...
---
Ad victorium✊
---
I'm just going to say it, majority of those legacies and God rolls are duped from the previous dupe waves. This isnt the first time the market was flooded with dOoPs and wont be the last either. You must be new or naive, the 10:1 weapon trades and $400 for legacies needed to gtfo.
---
Plus my experience of trading hubs and discord have been a waste of time. Either alot or people moving duped weapons around. Or everyone just asking for offers but never really replying. If someone told me what to pay or what they wanted I could work towards it 🙄 another reason for a in game market place!
---
Yeah i would go with plopping down some missile turrets. They evaporate most invaders
---
Whats dbno?
---
Downvoting is censorship, so I don't do it.
---
Not just atom shop and new items in game, some of the weapons etc.. that have been in game from day 1 have largely been ignored.
---
There still isn't the bull mod for the 44. Revolver, the chainsaw is practically useless  with over half the mods for it don't do what they say it does just to top off the uselessness.
---
They advertised the biv quest with a drink called fire ant/berry whisky which still hasn't been put into the game.
---
This is just ones I can remember off the top of my head but there are alot more.
---
AND yet they fix completely pointless things like the time they added a light in watoga high school which no one asked for lol
---
I found this last night... Level 32, decided to go down and do the Miner miracles quest, because I'd heard it was for level 25 I figured it would be ok. But the first thing I saw was a level 52 Mr. Gutsy guarding the entrance. He shot at me immediately but I managed to sneak in.  The interesting thing was that there were lots of level 52 Mr. Gutsy robots inside, but the ones inside just stood there and let me shoot them until they died. 
---
I cleared out the lab pretty easily but realised I didn't have any ultracite and thought I'd check out the mine shaft on the other side of the building.  That's where I encountered a level 60 diseased super ghoul, he messed me up in seconds... I died a few times before bugging out.  I guess I'll just finish crafting the armour somewhere else.  
---
When zones get scaled up to higher level players, how long before they reset themselves again?
---
F
---
&gt; What do you do when you can't buy / sell for caps, trade in Legendary Scrip, stash limit, etc?
---
Switch Character or store the excess stuff and sell it the next day. I don't grind everyday, so having some stuff to sell on days i do not play that much does the trick for me.
---
Totally!!!! The BONK sound from the shovel is so satisfying lol
---
About a month ago I got both of them, after 6 months of grinding out the 4 events on a daily basis.
---
The chance is about 0.02% (datamined), so you might understand that cap offers will not be looked at .)
---
That's fantastic
---
Tried the usual spots first, then following the outline of the ring. I’m sure this is sage advice, cheers mate, but I’ve already wasted more time than I can stomach.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Many users have reported the same issue. It appears to be the program on UWP won't allow installation to a drive other than C:\\, unless you delete a config file every single system reboot. That requires fixing by M$+Bethesda. They need to know about it. So I have reported the issue via review, report game to microsoft for technical faults, as well as here on the reddit.'
---
AFAIC it's a service announcement to anyone stupid enough to buy titles on the Microsoft Store (unless required for xbox crossplay or something). But microsoft censors it. I guess the FO76 board, ie place of fanboys, is not the place to complain about Microsoft's censorship or reviews of your favourite game. I haven't even played the game yet since it requires workarounds every reboot, which I'm not willing to do.

---
The people that build are forced to grind out the season to get the new items. So they can’t just build. As you imply.
---
It is installed fine. Click 'install' in XGP. Choose where to install. Click play. Loads and then hangs on the menu, 'noregionping 1.5.1' try again later error message.

---
It's a problem from Bethesda and/or M$ in their UWP deployment. I'm letting it be known as a PSA for anyone silly enough to actually buy titles on M$$tore.
---
I would love this, like put out a new limited time event every couple weeks to keep things fresh. Also roaming boss fights would be awesome and give you more reason to explore.
---
There’s No way you can complete all the daily challenges, do all the daily quests, max out your legendary scrip and your caps in one hour. It takes more than an hour to kill three creatures in nuclear winter! And it used to be nine creatures!
---
Still does, got one about a week ago.
---
Yeah, same. It seems you have to craft it as a separate cloth and spend flux to create the shielded mod again (it is bugged so it won't work anyways)... They should make it a skin for the already existing one instead of a different cloth. It used to be like this with backpacks until they fixed it and now you can apply a new skin to any of them instead of crafting a new one just for the skin.
---
*Snickers*
---
Wait until you hit lvl 100 and realize that the planetarium doesn’t work properly and that the Dark Matter Jetpack is the same skin as the Cap Cosmos White jetpack.
---
both, but strangely doesn't work with enclave events at that region, i.e. A Real Blast.
---
No, they aren't legacy, just much more rare than before.
---
have my up vote fellow EU wastelander
---
The messenger counts as a savage divide event no matter where it spawns just fyi.
---
I thought this happened once but it was in my stash
---
Insult bot is cold blooded, I want him at my camp
---
Walk it off
---
I really don't understand how people do these photos. Like do you die 50 times while standing there for the right angle? How did you take the pic of the 50cal shooting,if you cannot shoot in photomode(ok this one is your friend,but still you where really close in photomode).
---
It is that rare, datamining showed a 0.02% chance.
---
I had to grind those fucking events for over 6 months before I finally got the set.
---
So you are telling me spreading exploit method is get you banned or getting warning in offical forums wow I never think about that. I love fallout community people who can't read any shit but they can write and talk about anything this sub is great place to find people like you
---
If there was no way to purchase levels I would some what agree with you. However, because of these bugs people may not be able to obtain level 100 for free and than be forced to spend real world money due to no reason/fault of their own.
---
Bethesda put in a “free” battlepass which is completable without spending real money. However due to a bug this many not be the case for some people. They’ve already all but stated the next battle passes with have a premium side (fallout first rewards) so they are planning on making money off of it in the future.
---
I’ve lost 6k score but I’m level 77 and should easily make it, however they need to at least fix this bug in the next week or two at the latest to give people a chance to make it.
---
I avoid being on 20min either side of roll over and don’t play NW until I’ve finished all over challenges. It’s worked up until last week when my game crashed during loading in to adventure and it auto completed all my challenges.
---
This is the best thing I’ve seen all week omg  is there an exact spawn areas where it can happen or is it 100% random
---
Exactly. This is what I find unacceptable. They take a month or more to fix bugs that have an impact on gameplay, yet at the same time design mechanics that REQUIRE the player to virtually login and play every friggin day.
---
If they are stretched, then they need to bin off new content and cosmetic monetization bullshit updates and FIX THE DAMN GAME as a PRIORITY.
---
I get this with my Furious HM + drum mag, especially at SBQ or at Line in the sand.. pisses me off at LIS to see XP running past to another player just because I'm reloading again 🤨 or I get the opposite where it jams and won't reload or fire or come out of vats....'pfft'
---
I just take my free fast travel to Vault 76 and take out all the little Liberators.
---
It's because most people feel obligated to grind in legendary run which they're not, but nobody likes to hear it. You don't have to grind anything if you don't want to. The game favours both casual and hardcore players. The only grind complaint I can agree with is a good legendary weapon, that is completely random and can take a long time to get what you need if you're just unlucky. All the rest is pretty much optional. I don't mind grinding, its what I would do just playing. So it's very subjective, but overall people just like to complain if something doesn't suit their playstyle.
---
How can you possibly be sure? Have you done a ton of those fights where you had absolutely no one show up in power armor? I doubt it. There’s always half the group in power armor. Did you check all their perks afterwards? I doubt it. My whole point is that there’s too much chaos and things to account for that you possibly can’t monitor if you too busy killing adds and watching for the queen to get a good idea of what’s causing it. So while I’m giving some anecdotal evidence that disproves your theory and I’m still saying you can’t be certain one way or the other, you and the “many others” can be certain because you latched onto another trustworthy Internet rumor and it feels right.
---
By the way, I actually don’t sit on the fence or tent and grab aggro (I’ll do it if I’m out of Ap on my bloodied character). You know why? Because I don’t know what causes the queen to bug out and not land. Just like I also don’t shoot at her in mid air or have one gun army equipped. 
---
Oh, and projection much? Downvoting your comments? I could care less. I’m sorry you lost your comment karma.
---
Well lets face it. At this point its a guarantee random perks will stop working with each new patch they introduce.
---
I mean, if you're enjoying it. more power to you. I've met people who actually enjoy the grind in gachas and manage to get the higher tier stuff without spending a dime.
---
the challenges themselves aren't too bad. but being forced to log in daily or inconvenienced during your gameplay for months, is. so much so that Bethesda implemented the option to buy levels. and people actually did.
---
it's like that popup you get sometimes when checking the map, about changing your icon. most people would buy one just to make it go away. now imagine that a 100 times worse.
---
Meh, they're easy to come by if you know where to go.
---
It was unnerving until 2 game days went by and I said to Beckett “How’s Franny”
---
He said good and mentioned he would be a passing merchant from time to time... most likely just to annoy me by sleeping in my bed and playing my public tuba.
---
I think there’s a crossed wire somewhere. 
---
As I keep getting DCed in public lobbies and teams I tried talking to Jen Totally solo. Brought up burying her Mother.
---
Big confuse.
---
Fair enough, and I totally get what you say about the RNG. Before I found out that there was a scrip limit, I was sending all of it on mostly useless legendaries from Murmagh when I should have been hoarding modules and/or vault steel.
---
it's not really a looter shooter. I mean you shoot and you loot but the loot is often useless crap. Most people have to trade to get the stuff they want (or craft)
---
Nope. Not official ones. Some people have them on discord and stuff.
---
There's sort of an endgame (gotta kill something). But you make your own endgame. I am trying to collect all the plans. There's a lot and some are VERY rare.
---
Try and decide what weapon you want to use and try and spec into the relevant stat. Melee and shotguns are in STR etc. (Get pharma farma in luck for better chance to find them sweet sweet drugs)
---
pc people play with pc people. Xbox and xbox. ps4 and ps4. no cross platform yet.
---
I'd assume you'd have to be inside its very short range for the artillery nades to be worth it
---
nah, the grind isn't bad nor does it make the game not fun. people like to complain and given the opportunity, will do so. if it wasn't tlr, it'd be something else. if you're having fun, that's what matters. don't let other peoples sour opinions ruin a thing you're enjoying.
---
Fine print reads: And your first born child, and you can never criticize God Howard our lord and savior

I don’t hate him. His “congratulations!” always makes me laugh. Yesterday he even appeared inside my friend’s underground camp to give me a prize. So dedicated. :)
---
YESSSSS.
---
What’s the mask from the v79 called?
---
same haha, I also sold quite a few items thinking what is this weird message (not reading it, was ina hurry) and then I found out that I reached the limit and those scrip just disappeared. oh well. now I also buy modules and vault steel
---
Sad, comment is sad, small pp
---
For me this works: Logout 30 min before reset and login 30 min right after reset. Then you are good.
---
If im online while reset: boom, autocompletion.
---
If i login 12 hours after reset (the next day): boom, also autocompletion.
---
Hope this helps you.
---
Nuka Cola Plant
---
Fraternity Row house in the basement has 5-6
---
Whitesprings Resort has a vendor in a bar area that sells all flavors
---
i really want to try it out
---
I don't mind if caps won't be looked at. But people won't tell me what they want to be looking at 😂
---
I get the issues with it, but Bethesda is trying to get more people into the game. People who have never played this game don't know shit about the Responders or the Free States. The Brotherhood of Steel is the most recognizable fallout faction to meet this criteria. Maybe after more people start playing the game they'll expand on one of the new factions, but right now, it's all about getting new players.
---
As for the lore implications, has Bethesda ever shown lore consistency in their games?
---
Same here with handmade and 5.56 ultracite
---
Haha, yes.   
---
I turn the pipboy radio off, then when I get to a camp or a workbench it's a nice reprieve from from the desolated wastland.
---
Yes. :)
---
Okay, maybe not fifty times but yeah we go into a shoot knowing that we may die many times and use a ton of stims. Our last session burnt through close to 200 stimpaks between the two of us.
---
Yes I use photo mode and have gotten quite good at getting in close and quick.
---
Sorry to hear that. Good luck
---
It’s as bad as you want to make it
---
Because I am using Gatling lasers, I thought this is a feature that the power or energy of fusion core is below a threshold and it can no longer power up the weapon. So,  it is actually a bug.
---
How long are we talking.. thinking about starting working on that.
---
1. if you're expecting an MMO-shooter like destiny, you'll be dissapointed. 76 is just multiplayer Fallout- an open world rpg shooter (lighter in the rpg part than previous Fallouts), that lets you play with other people if you want to. they recently added a public team system, bit people tend to join them for a stat boost and then do their own thing. there's really only a handful of events that require and encourage teamwork.
---
2. there is no in-game guild or clan system, but there's many places elsewhere that you can meet up with people to join in-game. most i've seen are roleplaying one of the in-game factions.
---
3. the endgame is the grind. events, daily quests, the new SCORE event seasons. occasional seasonal (as in holiday) events. there's a lot of events. really, the endgame is what you make of it.
---
4. there are builds, i am not the best person to explain them however.
---
5. all PC players can play with each other, between steam, bethesda(dot)net, and i assume microsoft store. xbox and ps4 cant play with each other or pc.
---
[Poor Sips](https://youtu.be/fGAwjV-fyKc)
---
Not yet
---
you can use only one of the same type but if you have different types of fridges you can use all of them. I accidentally found out that yesterday myself, because I forgot I had an ice box and bought nuka cola fridge when it was on sale. so now I have both and can store things in both of them which is cool.
---
I for one am glad im tired of all the raider shit. I would like to see a few surviving responders show up though in the future.
---
I have my Forager's chair behind my bar, with the meatweek cloths and a bawler hat.
---
It's Vault 94 mask, but after Wastelanders you can't get it in the vault 94 anymore, so they allowed it to buy for Gold Bullion from V79 vendor, don't remember the exact name. Previously it was rewarded for completing any V94 mission on Hard Difficulty, but after Wastelanders they've changed it slightly and the original one doesn't look that good anymore, while that one for gold is look as previously original one.
---
I have one but don’t really like the look.  Value?
---
I feel absolutely nothing .... please help
---
I'm happy to buy one off you if you do!
---
Ok then. What's your method to transfer items between characters? 
---
Fallout 1st private server or drop and pick up? I don't have fallout 1st and I don't trust normal servers enough. 
---
Trusted Couriers? Sure, i don't mind once or twice. But I don't like troubling other people and I'm not desperate enough. 
---
So that why it would be my direction for muling and item transfer unless something else better comes.
---
It more of the people that have been playing since beta.   Grinding the same events after almost 2 years gets dull.  
---
I’m one of those players but I do not force the grind.   I just play to play.
---
Yep, my quad explosive combat shotgun is breaking after ~750 shots atm. Used to last loads longer.
---
Buy it for 8-10k caps. Got
---
Duped to hell awhile back
---
Great idea!
---
Just Wow. I’m guessing you’re on pc as my pictures look like I’m playing Minecraft compared to yours.
---
Thanks mate, happy hunting to you too!
---
It's hard to say what value is in this game for me. I can say if I saw it in a player vending machine for 20k caps I'd pick it up. Im starting to collect outfits so making this my new thing while they develop new content. Haha
---
I'm a full health vampire explosive heavy weapon tank or explosive shotgun crippler. I love explosions &amp; body parts flying everywhere 👍
---
If you’re a fan of the Fallout series you’ll love it. The newly added NPCs make it very similar to playing one of the solo games in my opinion. There’s still some bugs and other issues but it’s not so bad that it disrupts the flow of the game.
---
Whenever I see this happen I pay attention to the next time I fire and it isn't because it's reloading when only half empty it's because the number when it reaches zero then for some reason counts up to a random number giving the impression it wasn't empty 🤷‍♀️
---
1.2k hours in and still enjoy it
---
For T-51b, check both Watoga spawns and the Military camp/post spawns near the cranberry bog, i got all my pieces from around there, if you dont know the spots:
---
Watoga Transit Hub, behind the locked door on the bottom floor
---
Near the crashed Vertibird Near the centre of Watoga
---
Most of the military camps on the outskirts of Cranberry Bog
---
Outside the Big Bend tunnel enteance
---
I've noticed when this challenge isn't up it's like a day at the zoo but as soon as it is some extinction event occurs.
---
In the last patch they added more logging to help them identify the issue
---
I've seen plenty of players on forums for other games (fo76 may be a bit different with having a pretty small pvp scene) butthurt because they were beaten in pvp hit the forums to complain that it must have been a cheater.
---
Send Me 4 I Am
---
I will be on later today around 5pm est
---
Its great until you finish all the quests then its events and daily repetitive stuff
---
How many of hours of gameplay would you say the main quests are?
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
The daily challenges STILL auto completing, Bethesda's refusal to do anything about it and customer support actively suppressing our cries for help, my support tickets get auto locked now before I even get an auto response!
---
Not sure, hoping someone else knows that answer lol
---
Yes lol it seemed silly to me but I just answered those 3 questions again and then they processed the refund
---
If Todd slept with your wife in a Cracker Barrel restaurant that says a lot about you, doesn’t it?
---
I honestly dislike when a discussion moves toward conspiracy like factors, but I’ll be damned if the thought hasn’t crossed my mind too...
---
Vampyre imo is the best full health prefix specially for high fire rate/Pellet based weapons
---
I was one that got it a lot . Last time I played nw was pre Halloween 2019.
---
On PC, the guy who made Perk Loadouts, which is taking them forever, had a fix for strangler heart too, but they didn't try to figure out what he did; instead they nerfed the fuck out of it. They have no idea how to fix anything properly.
---
I'm still waiting to roll a bloodied gauss shotgun, but the best I've rolled so far is an instigating, faster reload one. If i was a full health build I'd probably stick with this one
---
Anyone from Bethesda addressed this issue?
---
So I found a few spots on the border of my camp circumference whre I can place the Raider hanging tree. I tried putting a rug on one of the spots but then the tree gave the same error when I tried to place the tree on the rug.
---
It's odd where it accepted the tree placement because the tree base is 75% outside the camp border.
---
Tried moving it after placing but still no luck
---
Thanks. What would you look for in the other 2 legendary attributes? FFR?
---
I used to, but 90% are just static.
---
the game turned and still turns a lot of people away due to its mobile-esque monetization model. it inconveniences players at every turn in order to maximize revenue. it's a very unique experience nonetheless, and a lot of us brave through the bs in order to enjoy the good bits.
---
bottom line is that you won't get Fo3 or Fo4 with 76. you'll get a grindy mmo. I guess you can forego on good gear and just play the game "normally". but you'll still be inconvenienced by the various artificial limitations. plus, content-wise, even the DLCs in Fo4 had more stuff to do than 76 in its entirety. it's very barebones even after wastelanders.
---
and all of that, of course, assuming the bugs don't turn you away outright. imagine playing Fo4 or even Skyrim without the ability to save and reload whenever the game breaks something. that's Fo76. if something breaks, it's broken, permanently.
---
TIL thanks
---
Hahah yeah, I found that out late, bought one for 6k caps from a player vendor when they changed that. Now they're everywhere
---
Forgot about the commies. Under mamma dolces is usually filled with those or eye bots. TY for ringing that bell.
---
Vamps or furious. Or junkies, you really don't have to manage junkies, just get addicted and boom there's your 50% dmg boost
---
It works with orbital strike beacons too &lt;3
---
If I was sure that what I am looking for hasn't been duped... 
---
One mask for I/FFR/25AP lever or both for B/FFR/25AP handmade
---
Right now you need 6k of coins per week if you have something you need for gold bullion. Otherwise it's not mandatory.
---
Next thing you need caps for is to buy from players themselves. 
---
If you are looking for starter armor set it's around 20k and god rolls are not for caps (mostly).
---
Weapons are up to 10k for the absolute basic and up to 50k for something like "I can't afford the good stuff so I will use this discount version instead and feel like a shit since it's missing one good perk". God roll weapons are not for caps (mostly).
---
The point is the good things can't be bought for caps (ofc there are rare exceptions). Since either veterans are sitting on 4 mules full on caps or dupers don't care at all about your puny caps. And they can't use any in-game system to sink their endless wealth into.
---
Scrips are fucking joke since I threw over 50k scrips at purveyor and he gave me only one god rolled weapon lower quality and I think less than 5 god rolled meta armor pieces. That's a year worth of scrip. For what? 400caps per 3* weapon. Lmao. Sure some people are lucky that's the same as betting euromilions, someone just wins the lotto.
---
As for those who have problem making money... Run melee build or high damage rifle build, make and sell ammo, sell weapons and armor for scrip value. Sell materials, people are buying steel 1c per piece and one event of uranium fever or line in the sand can net you 1500 steel per run. There are also places with lead, screws, and other junk that sells well. It's enough to make 15k a day. 
---
Imagine relying on 1400 vendor cap to make money, what a bunch of losers.
---
It make perfect sense for the Brotherhood to investigate what happenned in West Virginia. The last time they had contact with the local chapter, they were fighting an enemy capable to destroy humanity. Do you really think they would just say "Well, I hope they succeeded... now, let's focus on lost plasma pistols and Power Armors in the wasteland".
---
I also think the Brotherhood is overused, but now that they started a new story with them, they have to finish it.
---
Depending on what your agility sits at I would say 33 Hit chance and 25 Vats if you have high agility or else any second modifier with either 15 reload or 90 reduced weight
---
Unexpected sips
---
Don’t I have to keep getting the meds?
---
Thanks. Yep on PC but only 1080p.
---
The only etiquette and 'rule' I know is simply not to take over workshops from low level players. Above level 100, your workshops are fair game.
---
What can you do about it: not much. However, Billings Homestead is one of the easy workshops to take for the daily challenges. There aren't many places for the enemies to hide (so you don't spend time looking for them when you try to take it over) and you have flora that can also be ideal for other daily challenges (make x food, consume x food, ...) . It is definitely one of the popular choices to take over. I would advise to start using an other workshop that is more tedious to take over (for example enemies that hide somewhere in the workshop when you try to take it), has less stuff related to daily challenges and is more to the edge of the map.
---
An other reason besides the daily challenges might be that the player icon is no longer shown on the map at the workshop. So you don't know in advance if the workshop is taken. Once a player has spent the caps (and the time for the extreme long loading screen) to get there, they're invested and are more likely to take over the workshop to avoid spending more time and caps to find an other, unowned, workshop.
---
Nope not at all. I switched to junkies like 6 months ago and havnt popped a chem since
---
Yeah. This. Back in the day you had ro reapply your addictions everytime you logged on. Now you get addicted to 5 different things (make sure they dont effect your specials too much) and that is it. Unless you somehow take addictol you're good. 
---
Vamps or Instigating i reckon. You'll probably one shot most things. Instigating would mean you will more than likely one shot everything (except scorchbeasts and whatnot)
---
Make sure you use 1 rank of gun fu. And learn to jump while firing so you don't blow yourself up
---
&gt;That's the problem. How do you know that Fallout 76 is benefiting from any reasonable amount of the money Fallout 76 is getting?
---
We don’t, but they sure as hell aren’t getting any money from any other bethesda IP.  
---
&gt;  My criticisms are based on the premise that the monetization keeps increasing while the quality of the game does not, particularly in regards to updates to base-game earnables but also just what I see as a persistent lack of high quality updates in general. People are being drip-fed cash shop items and now season run grind to keep them occupied and paying.
---
And my assessment is that, with other games that have success, they can invest further into that game to make it better (and this is a general statement, not one specifically about Bethesda).  Fallout 76 was not successful.    They keep losing players, and players who are staying are not spending enough money to meet metrics they need to hit.   Their priority is to try to make the game financially successful, at this point the only way to do that is monetization. 
---
&gt;Bottom line, I already did quit. This post was announcing that.
---
No one ever cares about people quiting posts, if you played WoW you should know that every post made of someone quitting had “can I have your stuff” as one of the responses. 
---
Least of all Bethesda.  They don’t care. Your just a random line of data and it’s unlikely any of them will even read your post.  They would only start caring if they noticed a statistically impactful number of players no longer playIng.  But even then, the amount they’ll invest will be minimal.
---
Rad scorpion omelettes will also cure your addictions I believe. But yeah exactly. People seem to think it needs to be kept up. But it's super easy to run junkies
---
Well they’re pretty impressive.
---
its like someone is trying to fuckin torpedo this game from inside. its remarkable how many times they can fuck up in a row. i wish i worked at bethesda, they dont seem to have any standards with their work, if i could put as little effort into my job as they do, i would be really happy lmao.
---
I have 2 pieces of unyielding armor rn. Thanks
---
Don’t let others affect your own opinions with their rants, anger, and complaints
---
Ironically I just made a post on this about 3 minutes ago, I was just complaining how I’m level 263 with day one progress with legacy weapons, clothing, and items and etc and I get none of it on PC and I really wish Bethesda would implement this feature, despite them already declining this.
---
Works for me unless it’s the mire cliff site.
---
That’s still an entire team on a private server funnily enough. Where’s the foortage of it being done on a public server again? Mmm
---
Ty!
---
What I’m saying is you literally can’t do that in a public server.
---
Then until I see it changed in the description, I'm believing the game over some random person on the internet. Due to the fact that is a big change in a mechanic that will 90% remove pvp from someones playthrough and needs to be addressed. If you can provide patch notes that actually show it's been changed I'll be more than happy to accept I was wrong, I have no problem with admitting that because people make mistakes. However when something still actively describes something in game, you normally take the games word for it over someone who says otherwise usually because that is the source of our debate here.
---
Thank you! Very helpful!
---
Perfect! Thanks a lot!
---
You can do the Legendary Run, which is very grindy in the search for xp especially in higher ranks. 
---
Or you can stop chasing the high legendary run ranks and simply complete the daily and weekly challenges which is still grund but less of it. 
---
Or if at end game just do faction and overseer dailies which are virtually identical every day. 
---
The game is far better pre-endgane when doing questlines and you can do as many or as few dailies and misc quests as you like. After the final vault raid its repetitive grind for any type of meaningful progress.
---
The game play of getting bullion is not fun to anyone.  It is literally a fetch quest that takes no effort, through, or even much time.  No one likes it.
---
The wasteland is hard.. - stand your ground.. - and never ever forget your duc-tape!
---
*Take cover and his pills*
---
That’s why I do those challenges at a public workshop.
---
After nearly a year and a half of playing the game daily, I just cant stand to hear..keep whackin n whackin n whackin it..lol
---
Were talking about that grind, not the game overall.  That grind is NOT fun.  It's stupid.  It's a fetch quest repeated literally like 100 times.  No one finds it fun.  I didn't realize I would have to defend this.
---
Just because you like the game overall (which obviously all of us must) doesn't mean you can't point out the bad, fun killing design, because this game has plenty of it.
---
Ah yes my wife did this aswell. I got the note and as a joke put it in my vendor machine for 420 caps
---
Someone bought it
---
Even happens on my quad harpoon which only holds 4 shots.
---
You call people idiots when the game is the source of this debate and where the information comes from. If you have no proof that bethesda actually changed this why should anyone believe it has been changed? If it has been changed I'll accept the fact that I'm wrong, but because the game description hasn't been updated nor patch notes have said anything, and the same thing has happened to a friend of mine without a workshop to her name, I find it hard to believe it's been changed.
---
You have to put the RR garage door on from the inside. That took me a frustratingly long time to figure out.
---
It also still doesn’t disprove the fact that if your teammates are detected then so are you. So keep trying
---
Same. Been waiting for a good under armor for NW since I missed the last one that was in the shop.
---
They did compensate you by giving you MORE challenges to complete, like a buy one get one free sale at your local supermarket raising their prices right before the sale, Bethesda made those daily challenges more difficult to complete.
---
Don't see why you would get backlash
---
But this would be a good feature tbh
---
&gt; It takes more than an hour to kill three creatures in nuclear winter! 
---
Hit the Prison.  Usually 2 ghouls in the prison yard, and often one or more outside.  The mansion (forget the name, the one that has the event where you help the robot butler prepare for a party) also usually has 2-3 mutant hounds.  Kill the ones you see, if you didn't find 3, close it out right away, and load in there again.  Shouldn't take more than 15 min.
---
The only way I would support this idea if it's a one time AND a one way transfer going from Console --&gt; to PC because that way your given the option to import your progress without tainting the Console community with the  egregious amount of nonsense people have pulled off with all the hacks/cheats/exploits/trainers/3rd party programs available on the PC version of this game.
---
I've always wanted the jukeboxes to give us a choice of what music we want to play, like it could give us some options when we click it and we choose from the list, like a real jukebox.  If Bethesda could make this a camp item that could link to a spotify account that would be amazing!
---
Yup..
---
There are actually 2 bugs.
---
* the old re-occurring one where the cores are not depleted yet the weapon refuses to fire on them.
---
* the new one, from wastelanders, where due to to lag the weapons fire down to zero and then jump the visual count back up to a random number.
---
Warned yes.  But many of us love the fallout universe and the Bethesda secret sauce gameplay.
---
I think a lot of us choose to put up with the bugs in the hopes it will get better.
---
It happens very frequently to me on PC (~25-50+% of the times I load up the game) and won't stop until you restart the game. Good thing this game only takes 10+ minutes to fully boot back up /s
---
A lot of my suggestions I’ve posted I’ve gotten backlash, I was just preparing for it lol
---
But yes I agree thank you
---
It takes them longer then that to acknowledge anything is wrong.
---
That and the lack of any pride in their product.  They, as a company, act like 10yr olds forced to make something so they just slap something together to be done.
---
This is EXACTLY how Bethesda comes across in regard to 76.  Like "oh shit people are still wanting to play.. well (quickly and carelessly slaps something together) here ya go!"
---
It's why my fo1st is canceled, and I won't spend a dime on atoms.  Not that the latter matters, it's all camp shit noone has space for or useless skins.
---
Third time I've seen this, this week, and if you're on PC, I'm going to suggest [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/655). Hopefully that tides you over until an official release. :)
---
Looks like someones going to steal my sweetroll
---
Why didn't the BoS just walk over from the Washington Capitol?  They could have combined their story line with Appalachia and it would have made more sense than crossing the country.
---
You're like Peter Parker setting up cameras in hotspots then doing battle!  Great photos :D
---
I did go to bed, it was a nice sleep. As I've told others, unless the game changes the description or there's actual patch notes showing it was changed I'll accept I was wrong. However I'm more inclined to believe a games description of a mechanic over someone on the internet due to the fact the game is the source that we're debating over. Also coupled with the fact my friend had still been murdered while in pacifist mode with no workshop claimed nor did she go anywhere near one. Which if you're correct could just be due to the games buggy and glitchy nature of hardly working as intended, I do not deny. However, until I see it changed in the description because that is a significant change that basically eliminates pvp almost all together if you don't do anything with workshops, I'm just going to move on with my day and hope you have a pleasant one as well. Seeing as how you lot like to curse and (not you specifically) insult others by calling them things rather than have a civil conversation is why most people don't believe you're in the right. If you are correct then kudos to you.
---
I will look but not sure if or where it might be.
---
I agree completely, I feel like this opportunity would draw people back in who have transferred to different generations of consoles, and if they want of support this game for a long period of time, it would be kind to the community.
---
I don't have to find you anything, you're a capable internet user go back in the patch notes to early this year late last year and look.
---
Wait .. fuck me.. that's how it works?  For. Fucks. Sake.
---
We actually know nothing about their other missions, as nothing about the Brotherhood between their march from Mariposa to Lost Hills and the events of Fallout 1 are known, with the exception of a few events local to California, like how Maxson II was killed in a Vipers assault.
---
They might as well have made contact with remnants of the military all over the States, and possibly overseas. Bethesda might use the opportunity to showcase a big map of the North America with pins around the States, the Newly Annexed^^TM Canada and possibly even a few areas of Mexico or the Philippines where Maxson made contact and possibly autonomous chapters of the Brotherhood were established in a manner similar to Taggerdy's Thunder.
---
It would be a great Canonical fallback to explain the appearance of the Brotherhood in any future title, wherever it's set.
---
Same thing with bloodied, don't really understand where the upkeep is.  Get a bunch of rads and that's about it. 
---
Understand not everyone wants to run around with low health but there isn't really any work involved beyond getting the gear.
---
Then to be fair I don't think I have to if you're not willing to support your claim with proof? My proof of my side is in the game, in the pacifist mode description. It's how this works to support a side of the discussion.
---
Somewhere in Bethesda HQ there is a whiteboard with a list of things that *must* be in a Fallout game. If you have to bend or retcon the lore to make that happen, then so be it. As a result the Brotherhood is filed in the ‘oh Christ, this again?’ category, and it’s certainly not alone.
---
Ding ding ding. We have a winner.
---
Haha thanks!
---
https://discord.gg/FyDUUe
---
They want to keep it like "energy" in mobile games where you can't go on and grind for 8hrs straight for a week but login every day and play for ~1h because their statistics told them that each player 'could' in theory buy something in the Atomicshop each session. tbh makes sense with a studio that was previously focused on microtransaction-focused mobile games
---
Really nice pictures but......how damn long did it take to get that thing all the way to Watoga?  I can't imagine that was a quick process at all lol.
---
The night out one legit looks like concept art. How did you get that odd bubble effect in the sky? Is that a combination of the nuke smoke and his effects?
---
The majority of issues are probably based on the game just not getting enough development resources (developers, artists, etc.) from upper management. The devs know of the bugs, but due to the maintenance dev team being small in size, some things are prioritized more than others. There's probably a separate "A" team of developers that worked on the Wastelanders content hence why said content was all was fairly bug free. No broken quests or weirdness with the Settlers/Raiders outposts for example.
---
The regular devs are too small in size, so bugs either take an eternity to fix or just are not fixed at all due to it being a waste of time to fix from a profit perspective. For example, there's currently a bug where the Legendary Run level 100 gameboard wall mount reward appears backwards in the build menu preview option. I expect this bug to never be fixed as it's not economical to have a dev or two dig through mounds of code for hours and hours to properly orient the thing. Even bugs that seem simple to fix are probably very very complex to fix due to the nature of code, and the game engine itself having so many systems intertwined. 
---
At Bethesda, it's probably all hands on deck for Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 as the company has no new games other than those on the horizon which may be years away still. They need to make money to stay solvent, and the money just isn't in a 1.5 year old game with a solid but not very large playerbase. Fallout 76 isn't in the state where it's selling gangbusters anymore. As a company, you're not going to assign a lot of people to something that doesn't have the potential anymore to make that much money.
---
Just filled it with lots o loot this morning..hehehe..🤺🕵️
---
Oh alright thanks very much!
---
Difference is no mans sky has been updating it since release,with no micro transactions as far as I know
---
I turn them off when I go into rooms or houses that are abandoned or where there's corpses... I dunno why, just feels a bit respectful of the dead, lol.
---
Well the trade off is the DLC is all free here. Not skins, necessarily, but new quests, storylines and features. We’ve gotten a lot more Than wastelanders since launch (pioneer scouts, brewing, new events, new weapons, burrows, player vending, legendary exchange, new random encounters and side quests) and wastelanders was released less than 18 months into the games life, not 2 years.
---
And wastelanders is more than a few quests. The instanced interiors will be a building block for future expansions. Same with the instanced conversations. 
---
We also got many new locations with WL, new enemies, and new weapons/armor.
---
Couldn't have put it better myself
---
If I kill a scorchbeast mid glide they literally zoom across the map like a shooting star, I accidentally did it to the SBQ and just a whole gang of power armour hiked across the map to find it
---
Very stable, in my experience.
---
you know shit is fucked up when normally equipping a regular old in-game item is considered an exploit lmao.
---
I could be wrong but I think each one works off its own timer, not a total stack
---
Down* but not out? I think.
---
These are great! Well done!
---
Not to mention it's a crapshoot if you can stim or not while the gun is spinning. Not sure why I'm bothering to keep energy weapons on me at this point, since I don't have any legacy.
---
YES. I have been saying this and I think people think I'm nuts. I have played my share of NW. Am level 85.  I know where to find creatures...but I've given up on this daily because I'm finding they're not spawning when it's a challenge. 
---
It's like some cruel vault test.
---
They're not going to add any new songs. Takes a lot of money to get the rights to license that in a game like this. Use some kind of playlist, there are dozens of them specifically aimed at people wanting something like that
---
I had this going on for a while before even getting the ammo converter so I'm not sure that has anything to do with it.  That said, it was happening for about a week to me and then just stopped and I haven't seen it again since.   No idea what was causing it unfortunately.  With any luck it will just stop for you too.
---
Nope
---
Or that they have different teams working in bubbles on different builds of the game and when they graft them onto the live game it breaks.
---
Sigh, this just makes me wish for an Insultron collector bot for my CAMP even more. Of course I'm biased, I like the Protectron more than any other robot in the series and I was more than a little pissed that Bethesda didn't include a real Protectron voice in the Automatron DLC for Fallout 4 (I'm guessing that that was due to budgetary issues regarding paying the voice actors to give the various robots the standard voices).
---
Whitespring and a few other not so prime locations have water under the dirt. To be honest to camp builders it is a pain in the ass since you can not always drop a foundation.   
---
That said there used to be a blueprint glitch but that was fixed long ago, and instead you can not have 50 ammo factory resource gens in your camp or anywhere...
---
My friend used to have his camp on top of that lake. The free fusion core is really nice for a low level.
---
all in all that's pretty minor compared to even a singular Fo4 DLC. not to mention wastelanders is essentially one big fetch quest plus a bugged vault raid.
---
and speaking of which. the bugs.
---
You’re missing out on easy score and some really nice skins
---
Um..
---
We’ve received more content than I would say 4/5 FO4 DLCs combined (not far harbor).
---
And if that’s all you think WL is you either rushed through or didn’t notice all of the other changes to the world that came with it.
---
Or even the revamp of ESO a while back by the same mother-company. My take is their management saw the name 'Fallout' as a means for a filler game to pump money in while the big studios are busy but was never meant to become anything more than a amateur indie title. and because of the disconnection of the management on their islands somewhere in the carribean and the actually working employees they don't see how they're sabotaging their own revenue at the end
---
No, I never have either. If I wanted to play CoD, I would just do that.
---
I was on of those players - 3600+ hours in the game and played NW for 7 minutes (including lobby). But when they've kind of force me to play that to be able to finish Legendary Run without wasting Atoms I get there few times with easiest challenges (like place a camp or use lockpick). But I still hate this mode and don't plan to play it...
---
They should go with the stereotypes, and make them look like a giant pile of gold, or a huge piggy bank.
---
Maybe a big Mr. Moneybags statue.
---
I would totally use one of those.
---
Instigating, with Limb Damage
---
Yup, but then I tuned out straight after I finished Wastelanders.
---
they do test, they just don’t have the time and resources to fix it before release. They are pressured to get those sweet atom sales in
---
Ehhhhh fo4 dlcs were like....6-8 hours. Wastelanders is a lot more than that even if you don’t count any of the grinding for bullion etc.
---
responders
---
A lot of the stuff people want already exists in Fo4 and would only need to be ported over.
---
I’m using a Gauss Shotgun (no silencer) and I’ve not got any sneak cards in place. 
---
I did check all the boxes a few times and they remained empty?
---
Me either and thats why I said weeks ago everyone who has had this issue should write more details and less angry fluff. No patterns mentioned on any thread seem to matter on my xbox. 
---
The one thing I always do (since fallout 4) is after I quit the game I kill the game.  Not sure if that's what's keeping me safe from the bug or what.
---
Ps4 sadly..... I'll have to wait! :)
---
Figure I’ll finish Wastelanders first and save NW for when there isn’t much else left to do.
---
why not far harbor? that's exactly what I meant. all the addition since release don't even stack up to far harbor, a single Fo4 DLC. that on top of the base game coming nowhere near the level of content of base Fo4. then you have to consider quality. the quests in wastelanders are all mostly go to X, kill Y and bring me back Z.
---
you're arguing the absurd monetization scheme and all the mobile bs we have to trek through is valid, yet Fo76 is half the game 4 is, if that much, with twice the bugs. *and* Fo4 didn't have any monetization. saying "but the DLC is free" isn't exactly a good argument when you compare wastelanders to far harbor. it's not like I'd pay for wastelanders to begin with.
---
no it's not.
---
People are  entitled and bratty ''notice me'' whiners.
---
People play 76 for well over 60 hours, or 100's of hours and still complain as if they didn't get value for money. Then complain the game is 'grindy' after so many hours.
---
Hey mates ty for answers so basic u say matchmaking dont work .. im just asking dont wanna play alone in a world i dont mean a mmo destiny 2 was mean it in a way for example wanna do dailys or soemthing and is there options for find ppl for this activity .
---
I dont wanna manula looking for ppl if understand me mate
---
People still buy and play the game, they do not give a single flying fuck. People keep paying
---
Apples and oranges.  FO76  is an online, ongoing multiplayer while all the other Fallouts are single player RPGs.  The business models are completely different.
---
I have been checking out a game engine and may have found your answer in the help docs  https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/encrypting_save_games.html
---
Pretty great read, especially considering the source 🍺
---
everything with a daily quest/limit/cap or whatever should reset at the same time every day imo
---
It hasn’t been bad to me at all. I’m not particularly keen on the most recent “complete 3 events” daily, but other than that it all goes pretty smoothly.
---
Say goodbye to that sweet one star ghoul slayer's board.
---
Got the set Tuesday night from an event. Unsure which one now. I try to do any event that shows during session, except those in the forest.
---
No wayyy, I bet that was Awesome.
---
😆😭
---
Perfectly reasonable request.
---
Not quite the same but PC users were able to go from Bethesda to Steam, for free.  You're happy to pay for another copy, if needed!  Everyone's a winner!
---
Because far harbor is a much larger DLC. I think everything we’ve gotten so far equals far harbor but not including all the other DLCs. You can look at it either way. The point is we’ve gotten free DLC equal to 4 of the 5 fallout 4 paid DLCs combined....
---
And 76 has more to do than FO4, so I don’t know what you are talking about there.... more enemies, more weapons, more areas to explore, more quest variety. 
---
I really don’t know why you continue to play this game so much if you like 4 more and have so much disdain. Play the game you enjoy more. Don’t torture yourself. 
---
Edit: I forgot about wasteland workshop DLC for 4. So I guess there are 6 total.
---
I was going to say the favorites wheel is quick enough for me but I use keyboard and mouse, so I don't know if it's worse with a controller or not.
---
I agree this would be a cool feature, but I just don't know if Bethesda's FO76 team is competent enough to achieve it.
---
The same ones they used before.
---
I had thought much the same thing. When I compare it to games like WoW, yeah, maybe there isn't as much content: but one has to understand that WoW has been around almost as long as the internet. Also, it's more expensive. Give 76 a decade and there's the potential for something truly epic that might give Blizzard a run for their money.
---
Brilliant thanks hahahaa
---
being online does give you a free pass to make mediocre content. considering they're getting infinite funding in the form revenue, I'd think some of it would be funneled back into the game.
---
yet adrenaline is still broken.
---
like what?
---
I was extremely disappointed in that mask. The fern(or whatever) growing out of it ruins it to me.
---
If a bit... \*ahem\*... pornographic.
---
Evidently, we haven't, thus why there's another post regarding the bug.
---
I've had great luck at Grafton Steel, loaded in three times, two dogs each time.  Tagging works, had an uneasy alliance with another player where we shared a creature kill.
---
A basement and an elevator.
---
I like it better for Ghillie scout paint set than Ghillie mask itself.
---
it's a shame photo mode doesn't remember your settings from the last time. Each time I go into photo mode it's 'DOF off, Player Character invisible'
---
the stanley skin was fixed in the last patch
---
It's also turned into a pretty solid game with all the updates.
---
I’m level 20 but can’t select the perk cards I need for the class (like heavy gunner) is this normal? Also, is there a cap on the SPECIAL levels?
---
That’s good news that Bethesda is aware of this issue. 
---
I definitely think that there’s a serious time lag at the moment with this game. 
---
One of the strangest things I did see in game, they was a players character stationary outside the spawn point at Foundation. This character was running and not moving, he was just in his underwear, and what was totally weird? This player was no longer on this world. 
---
I noticed his camp had gone. 
---
He was still there right up until I signed out, running like mad and not moving?
---
I’ve not bothered to send a ticket as I haven’t had any feedback about my previous tickets?
---
Thank you for your feedback.
---
Westtek. Just go trough it and server hop. Sometimes there are 5 legendaries inside. Sometimes none.
---
Ah right, I’ll defo look at upgrading them then, any tips for when it comes to armour as I’ve only got leather atm
---
Zenidad

Leader of the pack in the forest has three guaranteed legendaries all low level

like the Vault-Tec jumpsuit?
---
how infrequently i see this event pop up, i genuinely thought it was literal.  I fall for it every now and then.
---
Is he using bethesda or steam launcher? If so make sure he doenst have the "appear offine" mode enabled in the launcher.
---
Whoa take it easy I was making a joke, besides I've been playing so long that I've got nothing to spend caps on except gold bullion from smiley, and that's kinda pointless already got everything I need and extra crap from the gold traders so not really to worried about doing every daily quest and daily challenges are so bloody simple now they can be done in 15mins that includes most of the nuclear winter ones,
---
I've got stacks of scrip worthy legendarys and about 30 legendary modules, currently I'm very happy with my 2 shot plasma caster so I have no need of maxing out my daily scrip.
---
My biggest gripe with this game is that there is SO MUCH they can freakin do to make it AWESOME, despite all the buggy shit. Hell, alot of people in this sub have mentioned really cool ideas that will very likely never happen...which is very sad and frustrating : /
---
I think it depends on how far though the main questlines you are.
---
There are a ton of missions and side missions to complete.  
---
Once you've done all those, launched a nuke or three, killed the queen, raided the vault, visited every place on the map many times, are relatively content with your armor and weapons, and you have no in game task other than dailys and bullion, sure, it can get a bit repetitive.  
---
  Independent of all that, gathering with a specific group, picking a random start point, and you all go forth killing and plundering NPCs, not worrying about bullion and missions - that's an entirely different story. :)
---
you're still making the point we've got a free DLC whereas far harbor had a price tag attached to it, while ignoring the fact the quality isn't there and people would chastise wastelanders if it was a Fo4 DLC. of course it's free, it's crap.
---
now I understand quality can be subjective, but the status quo is largely on my side. so take that as you will.
---
and the only way Fo76 has more things to do than 4 is if you consider grinding and repetition content. it's not. Fo76 as a whole can be reduced to go somewhere, kill thing, roll the dice for a crapshoot at getting good gear. repeat ad nauseam. the quests are all extremely shallow and only serve the purpose of setting up the grind. and when they don't, they're not interconnected or tell an actual story. it's just a bunch of equally shallow tapes telling you what to do to advance the loosely held together plot.
---
The burrows is usually where I get mine on a server where West Tek is cleared out, Harper's Ferry is a bonus
---
Ceiling paper so I don't have crappy wood ceilings please! Even plain white, just anything.
---
In my opinion for bloodied commando explosive is 3rd affix to consider (after 25% FFR and 33% VATS hit chance). I use B2525 Fixer for tough enemies and B3325 Handmade for all other, explosive rounds brake weapons faster and may brake "stealth", sometimes may also hurt enemies you don't want to hurt with splash damage. 
---
95% is a cap for VATS hit chance.
---
Well, if you are in a workshop area, pacifist is already turned off so your options really are not building there in the first place, fight them, or picking up your Gateway 2000 486 DX2 and moving to a safer location...
---
I once had one placed in a very shallow puddle no more than a foot across.
---
It’s not infinite funding.  
---
They have multiple online games, multiple offline games, mobile games, and other departments in the company (Such as HR), then the company has all the other expenses.  
---
Money comes in from multiple channels, then FO76 is given a budget.  Their budget is going to be dictated by how much revenue is coming in (since no company is going to allocate a bigger expense budget than it gets from expected return on investment.  
---
I agree that being online doesn’t make it an excuse, but on the flip side with how much this game has failed compared to obvious expectations at the start, they are likely only seeing a fraction of any profits from FO1st and Atom Shop sales.  Bethesda is not going to invest more money in this game, not with next gen consoles on the way. 
---
The Dev team is working with a limited budget, and the only way to increase that budget (or even avoid just being closed down) is to make more money. If you make more money, you’re given a bigger budget.
---
I mean shitty bug filled games is literally bethesdas thing.
---
What's even more hilarious is that there are people who play on console who ONLY play NW and never go into Adv
---
At least No Man’s Sky fixed their shit and continued updating with free content to support the community and win back consumer trust. Bethesda has added a lot of content, but still adds lots of buggy, paid stuff.
---
"free range" event has a garanteed legendary sheepsquatch. also garanteed legendary enemies at the events "project paradise" and "one violent night".  
---
charlston capitol building the DMV always had at least one for me and westtek was mentioned already. id check huntersville also.
---
If you have the keys to the TNT domes there are usually a few different flavors to loot in there.  Don't really need the keys if you know how to run through walls though.  Should be regular, quantum, cherry and grape in there if they haven't been looted.  Not sure if other flavors can spawn there or not, those are just the ones I usually find in there

Everybody complains about the Appalachian thunder pipe skin but nobody talks about how the same thing but worse happened with the screaming eagle skin, which they made you PAY for.

yes, they stack, but each bonus is timed independently - so you see the total time of the bonus to last, but when each "part" expires, the bonus lowers by 25%. Sorry for my bad English, hope you'll understand ;)
---
Game Development doesn't exist in a vacuum where players get to keep all the benefits of having a live service game without having to pay a dime to the Developers and Publishers for continued support of this game.  
---
There was nothing stopping Bethesda from simply shutting the game down because it wasn't the lighting in a bottle they were hoping this game would be but despite it's troubled launch and general perception of this game it turns out that there's people out there who enjoyed the experience enough to stick around and pay for things in the Atom shop so despite all odds this game is making money for Zenimax/Bethesda and regardless of one's opinion on the content implemented and it's longevity/quality the fact of the matter is that so far Bethesda has issued 34 patches for this game full of game balance changes, content additions, bug fixes and other miscellaneous things that people don't think about (for example adding new language support). 
---
Is the game buggy in some aspects? Yes it is will it ever be bug free? I don't think so but that won't stop Bethesda from trying to fix the game with each patch and despite still living in a Covid-19 world Bethesda still has content planned for the rest of the year without delaying much of it so far.
---
It's a pain. I too was always switching DOF off every time. I can add blur after I get the shot if I want to which isn't very often. Now I use an AutoHotKey script on an unused mouse button to launch photo mode, switch off DOF and take me straight to FOV as sometimes I only have seconds to get a shot.

* The burrows

* Red Rocket Rest Stop (I don’t take the workshop, but often find 1-2 Legendary Mr. Gutsy)

by accident doing an event in that area. wearing power armor and sank to the bottom and located it

And it will be said a million times after this, but nothing will change. People are assholes in the real world and cunts in the virtual worlds.

I don't even do the challenges in NW.
---
I mean it works, people are still buying their shit.
---
I usually get a couple in the Charleston capital building.
---
The Thunder Mountain substation 2 usually has a deathclaw at it and more often than not it has been legendary for me.  And a sheepsquatch has more than once spawned just northwest of that point.  But those are roll of the dice still.

Currently overseer rank 2 🍺

Absolutely takes the piss having the challenges reset half way through the day because you’re in a different time zone, don’t fuck with my caps too

Dammit, I just replied with the same thing. Lol

Thanks. The nuke wasn't in this shot as we had moved her out of the nuke zone. The effects are only from the Wendigo Colossus and I haven't used filters or anything.

Thanks man
---
Seriously every time I help take down a SBQ. Or worse, it doesn’t spawn loot at all.
---
Nooo it just added insult to injury
---
They're greedy and they're pressuring themselves. While 76 wasn't a bit hit, I'm sure they've made back the money it cost to produce it. Their biggest selling games to date is both Fallout 4 and Skyrim. They're still selling and will continue for years to come.
---
Not fixing these bugs is just ridiculous.
---
Yeaaah the people who do it either dont care about the countless threads, or thrive off them. It'll only stop when Bethesda adds shared event loot
---
Riding Shotgun event guarantees a legendary enemy. You can hop servers to repeat it.
---
Enclave gang rise up. gang gang motherfuckin gang
---
I agree with it, mostly. but none of that explains how Fo4 had actual effort put into it and didn't need to monetize every single aspect of the game in order to do so. a better game didn't charge me 150 bucks for cosmetics, or inconvenienced me at every turn so I'd pay for infinite storage.
---
it just baffles me that Fo4 somehow managed to be successful yet the mobile-esque monetization in 76 is somehow justified. it's almost as if they're not being entirely candid about the situation.
---
not to mention a lot of these fixes take literally 1 minute. it's been almost 2 years and I still can't apply muffled mods to my arms.
---
I'm not deleting my post and 0 fucks given about being suspended.

I'm level 140 and I had to look up what the burrows is.  I had no idea they existed!  New gameplay for me today!
---
Really? Do they know that to do any changes to SPECIAL stats they have to do that in adventure? My NW character is a mule (LVL4) who has very limited options to choose from NE Perks just because it almost didn't progressed in normal mode, so I can forget about any competitive play with it in NW.

Agree, think the enclave needs some more love.

Still waiting for the enclave berets that were data-mined, the president event that has been in the files for a dark age and the enclave pip boy that was put in the files many many moons ago

I keep forgetting about the Burrows when West Tek and Whitespring are cleared. Thanks for the reminder!

Boohoo go become a bloodied build then. They paid 60$ for the game so they can play it how they like

Have noticed they fixed the insurgent hat at least.
---
But yeah it seems just about everything in season pass is broken in some way
---
They're called whales. The 2% which make up a majority of the income. It especislly applies to free mobile games, but the atom shop too
---
Hey, Fallout 76 hacker here. I could spend hours explaining why stuff like this happens but the short answer is they DO test. The problem is with the way updates are handled. Heres the easiest way to explain it.  
---
Dev 1 will start making a building but hasnt finished it yet  
---
Dev 2 will start working on a new way to optimize how camp budget is calculated, have a basic version of it finished, and uploads it to the network that they keep these patches on.  
---
Dev 1 will notice a bug in the camp budget and submits it along with his unfinished building to the network.  
---
Dev 2 will take this patched CAMP update, and continue working on it  
---
Dev 1 will finish his building and submit it to the network  
---
Dev 2, still holding onto the unfinished building, will submit his finished work. That unfinished building then overwrites the finished building.  
---
It seems really stupid, and it is, that they do not have some way of preventing this occurring. They even admitted to this being an issue over a year ago when a bunch of old bugs came back. This is such a braindead easy fix that even using GitHub would be a better option for them. In my time working with their code, I have found so many instances of rollbacks that it makes my head spin. They even had us hackers in a corner with a new anti-cheat system that was nearly foolproof. Within 2 days they had accidentally rolled it back and bought us enough time to figure out how it worked and bypass it before it went live again. Thanks, Beth!  
---
And before I get shit for producing hacks for Fallout 76, the current hack me and the team have released does not work in NW and we designed it not to. It purposefully detects when you enter NW mode and locks most of the features off so you cant just kill everyone in NW. Youll notice over the past 2-3 weeks that there have been significantly less hacking in NW, but we cant do anything about others who use paid menus (ours is free) that do not lock out hacking in NW.
---
I try and use an automatic tesla for this. I used to roll a 38 fixer and just kneecap legendarys so everyone could try and tag it but proved to be slow.
---
:)
---
Welcome to the new grind!
---
i like 50crit, 25%ffr and 33%. explosive is fun and all but it has downsides like hurting yourself when mobs get too close and having to use additional perk cards to fully buff damage.
---
When doing an event, I switch weapons to only wound everything.  If nobody else shows up, I keep the bloodied lever rifle up.
---
This 👍
---
EVERY Gauss gun comes with an AOE explosion per shot since Wastelanders. It’s technically a default explosive effect.
---
Oh no, cosmetics :'''(
---
I saw Explosive does more damage and DPS than 25ffr on the damage calculator, but didn't think about it breaking stealth and ending sneak damage on tougher enemies
---
Thanks! It took a while, yes. xD
---
Thank you.
---
At least ESO actually fucking works and is fun to play unlike FO76.
---
I'd agree with you here, best to roll for something good because in the end chances are these weapons will be patched at some point.
---
I’m betting management expectations have absolutely killed the desire to work on this game for the devs, so they no longer put any effort into their features. They probably get forced to add things they’ve fought against and the job has become simply to make a living.
---
I know because I’m in the same position right now as a programmer at a startup and yesterday was interview #3 for me at a new place. I’m essentially doing the least I can without it getting me fired or making me look bad, because my boss doesn’t give me the resources I need, has insane expectations, and is generally hard to work with.
---
I wish we could see what actually happens inside Bethesda. I miss game quality like Fallout 3, 4, New Vegas, Skyrim, etc. I stopped playing this ages ago and uninstalled, but still follow this subreddit because I hold out some sort of hope. 
---
Edit: switched around some paragraphs.
---
Thank you
---
Not only NPCs acting like their family has died despite us sparing them Ra Ra acts like we have been treating her like crap when we haven't as well.
---
but you can't have BE Gauss "per-se" as explosive affix don't roll on energy weapons anymore. It's just kind of bonus for gauss weapons.
---
Workshops really is an unnessecary resortment for PvP, Survival mode really had the spotlight
---
Butt is life.

See that’s odd cause in 500 hours of gameplay I have never even once fallen through the map
---
Go to the golf course..your legendaries will come after YOU..lol(TT)
---
Oh you didn’t know?????!!!
---
Yo Assss Better callllllllll sumboooooooddddyyyyyyyyyy
---
Which is an innate explosive effect. The result is the same, even if you think arguing against it makes you right 🙄
---
I get this bug on most weapons but then once all the ammo is gone I can still shoot a few shots somehow
---
xD
---
A tip for clearing challenges that require legendary kills. The first 3 leader wolves in Leader of the Pack all count as a legendaries and drop level 5 to 10 legendary weapons. The event occurs around Tyler County Fairgrounds, happens fairly often, and even of you don't get all 3, they are spread apart far enough even if someone kills one, you might get a chance at one of the others if you don't go to the same spot the other guy is going. Just a tip for anyone having trouble with those challenges.
---
its always fun to try both ffr and explo to see what works for you, but all i needed to convince me was that captainoob youtube video where he took out the sbq with a b ffr fixer in like 43 seconds solo. that being said i’m sure the explosive wouldn’t be far behind, even 1* rocks
---
I’m sure that Bethesda/Zenimax have a good QA team who’s noting all these bugs, but learning more and more how the gaming industry works I’m certain this isn’t all on them. 
---
At some point, someone is looking at the bugs, weighing them against how much money whatever they’re doing will make them, and “fuck it, ship it, it’s functional enough and we have to meet a deadline.”
---
Could you help me get the bounty hunter trophy?
---
I pushed this one in my gaming group when it released, they're still mad at me.
---
With how often the game crashes I’m curious to know how often their office systems crash
---
You don't understand my point - I don't argue about the effect but about u/Yiphix comment that OP can roll BE Gauss Minigun - he can't...
---
Usually 0 or one, and sometimes more...
---
I use it with the shredder mod, so you can spin the barrel all night long without ammo. And it works. Deals as a bloodied build good amount of dmg but the weapon breaks stupid fast unfortunately
---
There is a legendary scorched inside the morgantown airport terminal. Near the end of it where you get the backpack. I don't know if counts as a legendary though as it doesn't drop a legendary.
---
any horde event has one
---
I had someone in all the public events I was doing today who was going around one-shotting legendaries it's just extremely frustrating. I use a bloodied unarmed build myself but I switch to a crossbow for tagging legendaries if I know it could be a one-hit.
---
a lot of people didn't want this game to be a live service to begin with, it's part of the reason why it backfired to hard. so... I don't see how that's a valid point.
---
not to mention skyrim and Fo4 were also supported for a long time with patches and fixes. and they didn't require any monetization for that.
---
a lot of the criticism Fo76 gets stems from how everything is monetized, not from the atom shop. the problem isn't that a PA skin costs 15 bucks, but rather that I have to be inconvenienced daily for months if I want that skin, or shell out one hundred and fifty bucks.
---
and that's how everything in this game is handled. the limited stash space, the daily limits. it's all so they can monetize some aspect of the game.
---
Well the issue that you mentioned a bit might also be the 1st subs that won#t cancel their subs regardless what Bethesda does. We have countless subs complaining about X being broken but dare mention they cancel their sub to actually show Bethesda and you get put on the wall with a gun on your back asked how you dare tell them to infringe on their freedom of giving money to a company that doesn't listen.
---
did you read or  listened to the lore in game? they weren't called BoS on the beginning, and the way they accomplished some missions wasn't BoS standart, in the beginning (forgot the real name) they even strike the protectors for supply.
---
Understandable
---
One time i felt so bad. I always carry around a really low level melee weapon because i have a pretty strong shotgun build. So i would just melee the enemy with the weapon and usually it would do enough damage so that i get loot, but not enough damage to kill the legendary.
---
This one time I was testing out a bloodied melee weapon and it was pretty strong ( shotgun build and melee build both fall under strength.).
---
I was running around killing everything with my melee weapon, when I saw uranium fever pop up. I switched to my shotgun and joined in on the event.  So i see the legendary enemy and I quickly switched from my shotty to the low level melee weapon ***so that I dont kill the legendary*****.** 
---
I killed the legendary in one hit....
---
I forgot to switch out my perk cards from melee to shotgun...
---
I felt bad...
---
2K+ hours and about .5 of those were in NW.
---
There have been many exploits to date and some that still exist to this day that force people into pvp unwillingly or allow people to kill others even though they didn't engage in pvp.
---
I'm not going to go through them all (and a lot have been patched out anyhow) but 2 examples are nuke mines that don't damage you but irradiation you to death &amp; a stranger joins your team or invites to theirs &amp; then starts pvp Intentionally with the express purpose to grief you.
---
I only one shot them if I’m alone. If there’s a group I’ll pull out a semi low level weapon I use to tag enemies and emote for others to get a shot in.
---
Ps4 forgot to mention
---
Can I donate free stims to your cause? These photos are seriously amazing and we need more!
---
Thank you for being respectful
---
That was the best thing I viewed this morning on this sub. Thanks
---
Nah don't be a cunt, if someone is doing Leader of the pack, they obviously need 3 kills, don't go steal 1 of them, that just means they have to come back and try get another, wait your turn for the event or server hop for your own. I had a twit yesterday try steal mine and showed up seconds too later for the last kill, he totally would have ruined it for 2 of my characters I was farming.
---
Definitely had people int he past come and kill one of them, very lame.
---
FO76 doesn’t get to see the money that they make from anything else, unless there contractual obligations to meet.  The team working on FO76 doesn’t even get to see all the money they earn, since money has to go towards other expenses in the company (such as HR), return to investors as a whole for the company, and other fees like continued license payments for music. 
---
Making the money back isn’t enough for any business, greedy or not, you need to have enough return on investment so you have funds to continue development.  
---
They have a small team, probably not their best developers, working on this game right now.  They have a financial metric to meet so they push out content that helps make them money.  Even the move to putting the game on game pass almost makes this game a pseudo F2P and they are hoping people start buying Atom shop items.  Next we’ll see more boosters being sold like lunchboxes.
---
This is all coming from someone who loves the game still and still enjoys it, I‘ve worked in corporate America for 22 years, I’ve been let go 3 times because my department wasn’t making their metrics. I just see the writing on the wall.
---
dense is usually the way to go. saves you 3 points from fireproof.
---
Because Bethesda is full of uncreative writers that reuse the same factions because of their incompetence to create new ideas. Also because whales eat up anything brotherhood related so of course they stuff it in every fallout that they make.
---
Since the game is not making so much money, they should have fired the QA team for cutting expenses
---
I dont think this is the ammo converter.
---
I used to ( and still ) get this when i load up into a new server. I will have more than enough ammo for the weapon, but I will also get the same error that you get. And yeah I also switch weapons to get rid of the bug.
---
Um, no. I buy plans from people.
---
Instigating.  Any Instigating, but +33 Vats, Fast Reload or Limb Damage would be nice bonuses.  Vampire would be my second, but way less powerful choice.
---
The santa scorched event was great for this. Found myself exploring all kinds of locations I had been to in months.
---
The entire point is being able to swap items between them, which mandates they be logged in together, therefor not the same acct.
---
Underwear is part of the models texture to prevent people from making them nude with glitches, like what could be done in their previous games.
---
It will probably never be fixed, unless the skins overlap it, but if they do that the skin colors may not match. The rocket girl outfit does this with the stomach, it's just a skin overtop of the player model texture.
---
I've finished one account and lvl 37 on the second.  Yes, It is as bad as you fear.  I'm damn tired of doing it.
---
Not legitimately.
---
Lol! Was not expecting that
---
Unfortunately no. What's worse, you can't scrap those to learn mods - you have to collect them as rare rewards from events :(
---
My bet is that the server lags and skips a couple of ticks of shots. So you end up with your client saying you're out of ammo and the server saying no wait you still have x ammo left.
---
I think the Devs added the description to all the armor pieces now. It will say something like Chameleon sturdy leather arm. I think the only pieces that don't have the description are the light variations. 
---
But that chart is handy too! 👍👍
---
I logged in one day and all my weapons were showing the ammo inventory as *the clip*, ie have 500 5.56 rounds in inventory, handmade clip reads as 500/500 not 25/500. I enjoyed that glitch for like a week before it disappeared. I love you ammo glitch, please come home.
---
Only with hacks and stuff like that?
---
Oh!  Okay.   Thanks.
---
Reduced weight Tesla's (or just a regular crafted Tesla) work well for carrying around as a "tagging" weapon. I'll also use the splash damage from the Explosive major effect on my rifles to tag with. Aim near, not with VATS, and tag with the radius effect of the explosive splash.
---
I've had this bug since uodate 20. It always happens to my heavies I have actively equipped when I log off. I dont believe its related to the converter.
---
Tÿr posted a video with chems of him doing it in 32 seconds! he used a b5025 fixer. pretty awesome hah
---
Damn.. :(
---
Maybe everyone’s forgot but the “leeching” missions are all off the books, only the vendor knows about it. Cmon people, details.
---
This, for me Dense is a no-brainer for every chest piece, regardless of the build.
---
At least for me its less about 'missing some' and more about the convenience of having it reset at a known time every day.  It could also be more useful to casual players since it would be something like "Oh, it resets in an hour, I should pop in and sell some stuff real quick before it does"
---
I just hate that if I am playing multiple times a day I have to go..."Hmm, I wonder if its been 20 hours since I first sold something, I wonder if my vendor caps have come back yet"
---
If you are from Cleveland, then you know that the Browns don't like Chili's, they are instead fans of Cheesecake Factory.

*Always have been*
---
I HAVE BEEN THINKING THIS SINCE I PLAYED THROUGH IT, thank you! makes no sense they blew it up lol
---
This is true, there is a thin, practically invisible line between bug, feature and exploit, although if you apply even the bare minimum of logic and reason you'll find it's an exploit, hence the word stemming from "taking exploitation of". It's obviously an unintended bug, and it's not something Bethesda overlooks as some little *whatever*, as it close to nullifies actual ingame features like reload speed perks, mutations and legendary modifiers. They do endorse the usage of some bugs though, like receiving limited time event cosmetics from Nuclear Winter (Community Manager even posted "enjoy the extra rewards!), but this doesn't affect gameplay, and at the very least populates a game mode they're working on making attractive. I just think Turtle should be careful, he doesn't cover his nickname like TYR or the other "bugfinders" do
---
yes, but you'd better avoid that sh#t...
---
Rooftop of the Watoga high school.  Is another spot.
---
Instigating bashing damage less vats cost combat shotgun blows away ALL shotguns mentioned here.  
---
In fact, any shotgun with bashing damage will be stronger than Junkie's or Bloodied IN VATS. I highly recommend youtubing 'Angry turtle magical shotguns'.   
---
However, maybe one day Bugthesda fixes the magical shotguns and then you'll have to resort to the shotguns mentioned here. So keep one back-up.
---
I disagree, it's the same mentality that keeps people with their abuser for years. When it first started, it wasnt all that bad, and people gave Bethesda's the benefit of the doubt thinking that it would get better.
---
But it it hasn't, its steadily gotten worse and worse. And when you live with it every single day it conditions you to not think that it's so bad, even when everyone around you outside of the bubble can clearly see that it is.
---
And that's why when you take a step back you can see just how atrocious the game really is. I lurk this sub waiting for a time when the game will be fixed, but as time goes on it becomes more apparent that it will never happen. Ever
---
Faction decor, graphics, flags, etc
---
All the stuff released has been through the atom shop. They really needed to have basic stuff in game.  I have no problem using atoms on premium stuff but nothing in the game I can get?? I had to wait over a year for Responder stuff. Some people are still waiting for BOS and Enclave items.
---
i think canonically at this point (fo76) they aren’t in the capitol wasteland yet?
---
It works cause you only log in for a single big session a day.  If you log in for multiple it can be annoying to keep track intuitively and know when the vendors open again.
---
Can u wear it in nw?
---
I run the biocommesh which makes my chems last longer for XP right now, but I used to run dense which is also good.
---
Any enemy except maybe flies can stagger you.
---
It's already looks atrocious without any paints ;)
---
Yeah I don't cheat or use stuff like that... I'm disappointed though... :( Thanks btw
---
I think the US req thing is really bugged. Yesterday I got a “get the supply drop” quest marker even though I haven’t loaded a tape into a radio tower in weeks...
---
That one never showed up. Maybe it just took a while.
---
Or simply, the colour scheme of the existing stash boxes.
---
I'd love a Responder one... Nuka Cola one.... Instead of having to make this Lego baby blue heap of shit blend with a sleek black and white modern apartment base.
---
Edit: Sorry was talking about the scrap ones...
---
No, you don’t understand. He never said “go and roll a BE gauss because you totally can”. He said if you want a BE the easy way, go for gauss. Because every Gauss weapon has an on-hit explosion, EVERY Bloodied Gauss gun is automatically a BE by design. Just because you want to argue semantics and keep downvoting everyone doesn’t mean that OP is wrong. Every B Gauss gun is a BE Gauss gun by default - making OP right and you wrong...
---
So you don't want a 20hr reset but 24hr instead...fine.
---
But do the math and you discover that equates to 1 less reset every 5 days, or 1400caps trading. Suddenly its not such an attractive idea after all.
---
bloodied 40% bashing with an acceel barrel is a magic gun just FYI.
---
then stop doing it?
---
There is just alot to test. I am currently amazed by the game, and how well and smooth it runs compared to the start. I came back and build a camp around a bridge with rail, just happy. And yes they should test more, but honestly x that would take alot of time given all the variables to test in the game
---
You got one as well!?
---
holy moly thats insane. i wonder if 50 &gt; 33 then?
---
No, you don't understand and I have no time to clarify it for you any longer...
---
I think everyone could agree that FO4 had more than it’s fair share of bugs, and still does - some were never fixed, only fixed if you use the unofficial patch. Same with Skyrim.  They moved their monetization there to creation club.  But there lies the problem with single player games - they are easy to mod and pirate DLC for. Every creation club item is available for download.  A couple of their DLCs were also just basic camp upgrades, like the one that added the vaults.  And while the game may seem to have more effort in it, so much of it is wasted and useless, such as the manufacturing addition.  
---
Fallout 4 had a bigger budget to start, and it sold well because people love the fallout franchise. Fallout 76 they knew was an experiment, spent less on development (and clearly more on marketing with some of their ads) and then had tons of issues on launch.  People returned the game promptly.  
---
Even with first, you constantly see people talking a bout “if I get first can I cancel after I get the emotes” they are only spending once.  
---
Also, I wouldn’t assume just a 1 minute fix.  If it’s not a value in a database, it’s going to take longer to fix.  If the value in the database is correct but it’s still not working, you need to figure out the root cause and that can take quite some time. If there is already a “True” in the muffled mod line for that piece of armor, then the issue is somewhere else.  Not to mention all the other things that might break when you change one thing.
---
Unfortunately this sub doesn’t allow pictures, but the hinges are on the left side of the door, and it just swings open as if the hinges are on the right side of the door. Suppose you are supposed to just look at the fireplace side but I really like the white door and iron black hinges on the side. Just hate that the door doesn’t make sense
---
Hardened mass is pretty common on scorched, if you get a SB spawn just keep it alive if you are able to tank it's attacks, and a lot of scorched will keep spawning for you to farm. High rad fluids have always been an issue, but if you follow [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hzcoh4 /any_good_suggestions_on_farming_fluxs/fzi2bkb/) comment string, I gave my thoughts and experiences on mat farming very recently already elsewhere. 
---
The spawns are like ten minute cycles for the grove, base delta and the bunker. The grove is best as it's an assault encounter location so can spawn the colossus wendigo as well as a lot of times super mutants, which are great for high rad fluids (as mentioned in the thread I linked). 
---
The bog is as far as I know the only real location for crimson but you can get a lot with green thumb as long as you have the other mats saved up already to craft.
---
Morgantown is best for cobalt, WS is ok for everything but leans more towards yellowcake I believe. 
---
The mass legendary drops were back in the old days at WS. You could game the spawn system so they'd just keep spawning endlessly, and there was a very high chance enemies there would be legendaries. You could quite literally get more legendaries than you could ever possibly use or hold, but they nerfed it into oblivion by fixing the spawns and also changing the legendary rates. There are vids on youtube still showing it I would imagine.
---
It's still good on occasion, I've had between 6-12 a few times since but not often. You can get that kinda thing anywhere will a lot of spawns if you're absurdly lucky. I oonce got 8 legendaries from the grove in the bog after a nuke, and I've had 10 from west tek super mutants.
---
Same 🙄
---
It doesnt work in NW ?
---
No there is a fireplace on the other side. Pretty sure you just change the swing direction with flipping the doors over? Doesn’t change that the hinges are on the left and the door opens has if they are on the right
---
They have some amazing tours and it is an interesting, if sobering, part of history. If you ever get a chance to go, make sure you book your tour early. The spooky night ones fill up fast. I’ve also heard they usually have an awesome Halloween Ball, although I doubt it’ll be on this year.
---
I ran through one by mistake, right off a cliff.  I’m assuming the player knew that it was broken and placed it that way on purpose. 
---
Thankfully I always visit camps that are floating in PA, but still annoying.
---
No, it would be first come first loot right after reset, or not?
---
The only way that could happen is if the whole company went under or was bought out.  If they go under, they could sell their assets to fund any debts they have.
---
This game has way too many issues for very little new content being introduced, sadly my patience came to zero and I ditched the game for now.
---
Its kind of amazing that shared loot hasnt made the appearance yet. Also why did they make role based public events and not have shared loot, like how will I grab ore and deposit AND try to keep track of the legendary
---
Nope.... 
---
Like the loose vault 76 suit
---
Or tight variant vault 111 or 88 suit
---
or armored vault 13 suit 
---
I would like the option to wear these as outfits above your armor.
---
I've received plenty of Enclave pistol and never once seen a Legendary. I've also never once gotten a mod from scrapping them. They are basically a redundant weapon as once you qualify to be awarded them they are nolonger competitive.
---
What you're surprised this company doesn't invest in testing? shocking, its not like they have been getting away with shit like this for a couple decades and you people still support it.
---
Id say you can keep a Q3325 or a F3325
---
Tbh, keep any that is 3325 hahaha they are basically the best roll you can get.
---
People got crabby about the fridge being p2w so they nerfed it at the outset to 50pct food spoilage which makes it useless. 
---
They needed to give a junky/rusty version away for free and sell the cool skins. Win win. Of course they didn't do it this way and now the fridge is just mostly cosmetic.
---
Also still rolling :( 80 rolls in
---
It’d be harder to eventually monetize them if this was the case.
---
They have been selling a faulty product for almost 2 years.
---
Yeah that will hold up against a legally binding document. It's not like they will ban you for those things either, although they could
---
Dense plus one rank of fireproof let’s me stand on a car while it explodes or let’s me survive 1-2 close call explosive bullets without killing myself.
---
Very true but I would point out that Bethesda got, and continues to get, roasted for 76. The game is a bit of a running joke, making headlines every few weeks with another bizarre bug or screw up. There are repercussions but there is still enough money coming in that it doesn't matter. As long as there is profit, a net positive, they will have no incentive to stop half-assing it.
---
Damn...ok thanks
---
All the shotguns mentioned here also have the magical effect
---
Edit: also a B3325 would be even stronger
---
Yes. That’s why you should d u p e
---
LOL-   yeah my monicker has been Sage since Ultima Online and I once lived in Arizona.
---
Lesson here, don't let 16 year old self choose your online name and don't put  a location in your username if there is ever a chance you'll move :P
---
I saw that too but couldn't catch how he did it. My HM does shows 283 damage when 19% which I've been told is good. I fought one last night with a group and took like 5 minutes to kill. I have the same build as him a B50 HM. Full UNY gear and the mutations I need too..
---
Oh ik it's fun but I only use it if it looks like the lobby is having a hard time killing her otherwise I stick to my handmade and let everyone else have fun and get a piece.
---
Yeah i kind of blasted through it all on my main (level 202) started in February. So i started another charachter where im taking it slow. Only in private world and no fast travel. Im having so much fun with it. then i go on my main if i just want to dick around.
---
nevermind, I am back to playing RDR2 since it has new content
---
The legendary door with the fireplace has hinges on the left of the door but opens as if they are in the right side of the door...
---
Solid.  If going to West Tek anyways might as well hit up Huntersville afterwards.  Those two locations alone frequently get me the three I need.
---
haha yeah dude, if you are playing stealth and crit spam i would say 50 is better. with full unyielding i figure you dont need the vats hit chance cause of your perception being so damn high.  i cant wait until they fix adrenaline though, those dudes are gonna be at like 15-20 seconds!
---
"Lot of content"? lol
---
I have transitioned to a BE handmade. Works in both situations as the explosive damage alone is a great way to tag creatures without killing but direct shots murder everything.
---
See this is exactly what I wanna try that thing looks brutal with a shredder mod and I got a raider style character going on all I need is a blood stained skin for it.
---
Who, who hurt you?
---
Also- emmett mtn hazmat suit- once it breaks you are unable to repair it.
---
Does anyone know if the Strangler Heart power armor acid damage tags enemies?
---
I feel like we've had some glances already. From time to time there's an uncoordinated mess between what they say in a ITV or social media post and what the CMs are told. The support team is clearly in the dark pretty much the same as we are. The long silence during any controversy (like when people thought we would have to pay for future seasons) proves that there is a lack of direction or communication, likely both. You gotta read in between the lines a bit but I really just wish they could move around the people who need to be moved and take this game to its potential instead of meme status
---
enormous pp
---
Its unacceptable,  clearly noone there plays this games, I think at the end of the day they dont care if it works or not as long as it sells
---
Exactly this. I played WoW for almost a decade and having everything reset like clockwork at the same time of day, or in the case of weekly lockouts like raids on the same day and time every week was perfect.
---
Sure extended maintenance exists just like it does with Bethesda, but at least everyone and everything is on the same page then.
---
Oh and a GAME MECHANIC aka perk card adrenaline still does not work. 🤯
---
small pp
---
Upvoted because why in the ever loving hell has this wholesome comment been downvoted into negative figures? What the fuck is wrong with you people?
---
Edited to add: “Sagetoes” is just about the cutest nickname for a dog I’ve ever heard.
---
Ok, so don't give your fusion cores to random ladies fixing their robots in the field. Gotcha.
---
Oh I am trying. I’ll waddle my power armored ass over there to slap them with my minigun everytime when it’s a flimsy one. But between the noobs who don’t know any better, the assholes who don’t give a shit and the people who just shoot them on impulse the second they see a star in the name (or any movement at all), I just can’t sometimes, okay?
---
3/5 times when I emote everyone after I find a legendary, some Fixer fucker just comes over and drops it instantly...
---
I like grinds in games gives me something to do or set a goal for myself even though I know most of acquiring guns in down to RNG and nothing I can control myself, atm I'm trying to get a decent quad or junkies railway rifle but who knows could take me forever haha.
---
LOL!  I've run into them in the bog, but never got it to blow up like that.
---
YES!
---
And camp items
---
Being a Bethesda q&amp;a tester has to be the easiest job in the world. Assuming such a job even exists.
---
Maybe it loads an 50% full core?
---
I had to throw a grenade at it to get it to come out
---
People hoping for a No Man's Sky/FFXIV-style turnaround are going to be disappointed in the end.  Whether it's the devs not caring or not having enough manpower, it's clear that this game is receiving the absolute least amount of attention from Bethesda possible.  To the point where things aren't being looked over even a single time.
---
There is no tradition endgame because the idea is its in continuous development with new quests and challenges added as shown in the roadmap. Stick in one final big boss or ultimate reward and people do that and quit. Many people who complain have often done several hundred hours of playtime, far more than they would in a linear story based game. Long term players are in it for the continuous character development as much as the gameplay, the search for that final percentage...except many then simply glitch, use magic weapons etc etc which negates the whole idea.
---
Collect ALL the things
---
yes you can role them with magical effects. I'm saying the first legendary effect is not nearly as important as the magical effect. For example a nocturnal bashing damage will be better than a BE.  
---
I didn't see this mentioned in any comment, with enough emphasis on the magical effect.   
---
I have AAE, TSE, BE, QE and Ghoul slayer bashing damage. The latter is clearly the best in actual game play.
---
The red train car just north of the whitesprings station has cranberry and dark.  You can loot it once every 24 hours.  The red rocket megastop usually has several.  
---
If you want to pay for them, then bubbles in the whitespring has most flavors.
---
Imma equip the crap out of this item now!
---
They’ve screwed up many things far worse than cosmetic shit
---
It's the apocalypse.    
---
I'm sure most don't mind using a weaker weapon to tag them so more people can get the loot. I was using one alt which was level 14. Doing "Leader of the Pack" which is bugged as F.    
---
Got 1 Legendary and the 2nd one got lost b/c the wolf leader ragdolled through the ground making any chance of loot recovery 0%. The last one is at that farm and some level high 300's kills the whole pack. The event only nets low level legendaries. They don't script for much and benefit lower level players more than anything. WHY we don't have a "Middle Finger Emoji" yet I do now know.
---
Farm mats to make ammo, which will then be used to farm more mats to make more ammo.
---
I had the same bug. Fortunately it showed the yellow diamond on one of the canisters from which it is supposed to appear, so I shot it and it came out a few seconds later.
---
I agree. I do trade and follow the market, but I intentionally avoid trading for mass duped stuff. It removes the fun and rush of getting good drops for me.
---
I've had people drop insane amounts of ammo and xmas gifts that I never pick up.  I just don't want to ruin my experience by participating in the exploit stuff.
---
It sure is. There's also more going on than just your rads being reset when this happens.
---
I have a camp near a small bridge in whitesprings next to the bridge/the little creek there has a good chunk of land the game considers water. It works for me since I can use the purifer as a connecter for the rest of my house and save a lil on budget.
---
It's also a pain tho because it makes building around an invisible barrier of water a tad difficult at times but I learned to work around it.
---
The fact you're asking suggests you don't grief others and even feel a bit bad for the retaliation.
---
Not at all.  That player got their karma.  Don't feel too bad about it
---
I'm not talking about bugs as much as how the monetization in Fo76 works. it's essentially one big gacha, inconveniencing players at every turn so they pay to remove said inconveniences. want to get rid of limited stash space? buy Fo1st. don't want to log in daily and do your chores? spend 150 bucks on atoms. and even then all the content is extremely grindy in order to retain players. not through quality, but rather timewasters.
---
the muffled bug is a thing since Fo4. again, bugs do turn people away, but personally I knew that skyrim or Fo4 without quick save/load would be a nightmare. and it is. but it's something I was fully aware of from the beginning. more to the point, the muffled bug *is* a simple database fix. like the shadowed one, which took them until now to fix.
---
and both skyrim and Fo4 didn't have any real monetization for most of their lifespan. the creation club came out much later, and like you said it yourself is easy to bypass. yet both games are a lot better than 76, even with all its monetization.
---
Ah yes I see what you mean now, I apologise.
---
So far ive rolled a Q33 G shotty and damn man the thing wrecks!
---
Not sure about “massive” issue, but I’ve had groups of players try and trick me in to triggering PvP.
---
I like leveling up through the lower levels, and have taken 5 builds to over 100, but that means I tend to look like a less experienced player.
---
I’ve had teams - usually a low level build that acts a lure - along with hidden higher level players that will one shot you if you engage. Also had my camp trashed a couple of times.
---
Whichever one has the highest durability bar.
---
I beilieve there is a legendary perk that increases durability, also the perk card white knight should help (at least w repairs) if u dont want to run always equipped n burn 3 agi
---
I think the BOS Combat Armor, but the SS Armor has the highest damage resistance. If you just get the White Knight perk under agility, it will help all your armor last longer, plus make it cheaper to repair.
---
Some cards are level locked, yes. It's best to apply points every time you level up, because if you try to "stack" levels so you can do multiple point allocations at once, any level-locked cards will stay locked until you do it.
---
Also, your stat total is the limit of the perks you can apply. A maxed Heavy Gunner will be 3 points, so make sure you have enough stats for the perks you want to equip. 
---
And yes, stat cap is 15.
---
This is the way.
---
I think robot but I'm not entirely sure. durability is highly reliant on luck regardless. there's also the "50% more durability" legendary roll on armor. I do know that trapper is really fragile, though.
---
no regular armor will compare to PA, though.
---
I'm just missing some of the rare outfits with the 0.02% drop rate, so I'm taking it easy until next week when the collosus is out then I'll grind that hard. I found the right build helps a lot in keeping me playing, power armor is fun but legendary armor with a jet pack is so much better.
---
Focused Junkie. Id found a Junkie's weapon in FO4 and had alot of fun with it so I wanted to do the same in this game. Too bad there's no Jet.
---
No prob, I maybe wasn't all that clear. Clarifications like this are good for OP.  
---
It is kind of ironical. I've spent months looking for a TSE combat shotty and once I had it, I switched to a bashing damage one and never looked back.
---
How does this post not have more upvotes than it does?? This has been the mindset of all the players for the entirety of fallout76 lifecycle.
---
A large part of me is collecting, camp building and exploring. There has not been a week (I have 1412 hours in total) that has gone by that I have not found some little thing I never saw before. Be it the teddy bear picnic or the movie set style room on a cliff side.    
---
There is also a strong desire to get what you feel is ideal for your build to optimize. Then there is theorycrafting for some, others enjoy doing the long form of the decryption. It really comes down to what you enjoy.   
---
Yeah the game can feel grindy at times, but for the last two months it has just been kind of smooth for me. Oh and camp building for me I change up once or twice a month and it takes anywhere from 6-10 hours to have my camp just to my liking. Hell There was one spot when I spent 3000 in caps just to move my module since the spot I choose didn't allow for foundation or stair mistakes (would lock them up period no work around to remove).
---
OTOH if you see a bloodied build just standing there blocking enemy attacks don’t be taking your sweet time getting your hits in. I’m blocking so you can tag it but I can only do it for so long! If I get surrounded it’s go to town time so get hustling and pop a few rounds in that legendary.
---
You are forgetting about Nuka world. That was a big one too.
---
Durability has nothing to do with the armor class (Light/Sturdy/Heavy) or Armor Type (Raider/Robot/Marine etc).
---
If you want your armor to last longer without breaking I suggest you pick up the White Knight Lv.3 perk under Agility and you equip the Fix it Good Lv.3 perk  under Intelligence every time you do find the need to repair your armor.
---
What? Far harbor got me 40 hours on first playthrough. Plus all the time i spent there after finishing it.
---
Quality is entirely subjective and of course you are entitled to your opinion. 
---
Anyway I think there is a settlement that needs our help...
---
The higher your Int when you craft, the higher the durability. And if you equip the right perk, the armor will break even slower.
---
You also gotta look at how your behaving at an event as well, you might be pissing people off and causing it.
---
I was at an event and a level 60 twat was acting like an idiot so the gloves came off and I one shot everything out of spite.
---
I've always shared but lately I'm getting to the point where I'm fed up with the behavior at events so I just act like I'm the only one and kill what suits me
---
I was 800 hrs in before I did my first match and it was literally just to get the ghilli suit and haven't gone back since
---
I always bash them to avoid one shot. Me and my sister will wave people over towards legendaries so they can get a tag. I only one shot if it’s just me. No sense in trying to take away someone else’s chance at a legendary as well. I just wish some would share the same courtesy.
---
That would be a cool Halloween type event for Bethesda to do, turn Fort Defiance into a haunted location during Mischief Night if they have that event again this year.
---
So this is interesting as i have the exact same with a TS Assault rifle that has the 33% vats - which is a magic effect according to Turtle. 
---
I had this AR - which i love - but whenever i start reading up on it , i read AR are b-tier weapons. I dont care about tears so i looked into finding a TS FFR AR. 
---
SERIOUSLY dissapointed by that buy... - see my dmg below
---
Tests done on Super mutants and high level Ghouls around whitesprings.
---
VATS version
---
output per shot : 140 and 360 (so 2 bullets)
---
FFR Version
---
output per shot : 140 and 140 (so 2 bullets)
---
Same perks, same gear and both in sneak. This went on for the 10 minutes i tested it.
---
Is this the same what you experience? Or do you still see every hit have the same exact damage popup?
---
 This has happened to me a few times and I have never played NW. I don't know why people are making this conclusion?
---
Lmao
---
Little under 400 hours and never have/never will enter NW.
---
You can upload a photo to imgur or any other image hosting website. 
---
Would love to see a photo or video
---
Ok. Have fun
---
Bugtesting 😂
---
Durability is not related to armor type or class. Instead it is "rolled" on the item when you loot it for the first time, or craft it. Your *Luck* stat affects directly how much durability you will get on the items. Also, item mods change the durability on items, and item level. More *Luck* you have, more durability you will get on the new items you loot or craft (does not affect traded items).
---
You can read more about it here:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Luck#Fallout\_76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Luck#Fallout_76)
---
Yep true!
---
And yeah haha I had the same. I was looking everywhere for a BE25 shotty too,  and when I found it, it was....meh. I was disappointed. This was all before I knew that magic effects worked. I used a pump with bash damage before I got the BE, but after getting the BE , I decided to find a B3325 combat shotgun, and it works amazingly ( for close quaters, otherwise ill blow myself up if I use the G shotgun hahah )
---
Legendary etiquette aside (and, IMO, the people who use the “come here” emote when they find the legendary, so that everyone can come tag it, are gods for whom there is a separate, more awesome level of heaven reserved) I have a genuine, non-salty question for the one-shotters.
---
Doesn’t it make the game boring for you?
---
I’m a 100+ level character with a fairly well tailored build and an ok weapon. While I can’t one shot things, I very rarely die anymore and I’m kind of getting... bored at the lack of challenge. 
---
The only critters left in the game that pose a challenge are mirelurk kings and those terrifying floaters. Any other situation I can pretty much tank my way through.
---
And I’m missing the days where a camp full of super mutants posed a challenge and required some strategy and stealth on my part.
---
I’m wishing they’d come up with some bigger, badder bosses at this point.
---
If I was able to kill things with a single bullet, I think it’d be the end of the game for me.
---
I try not to but sometimes its accidental because I dont realize its legendary until after.
---
I have quite a few friends got this game and not had a problem installing it, so if one piece of software installs fine one one machine, but not on a different machine, surely the software isn't the problem?
---
Hopefully they fix this soon. The under armor will look great with the new secret service skin.
---
Me. Never tried it. Not even to see what it is about and how it looks. The same with the old survival mode (not logged in even once to a survival server). 
---
The day slap damage was removed from adventure mode was one of the happier Fallout 76 moments for me. 
---
I just despise PvP.
---
I’m not forgetting about nuka world. We’ve received more content since launch than was included in NW. the area of the map is larger in NW but there isn’t much there. Quests were pretty shallow and disappointing. I liked them, but NW didn’t live up to my expectations. The lore was pretty week also. 
---
This is my own opinion obviously.
---
In this case, it was a penny, that I didn't ask for, but they gave it to me, and then I didn't use it. Then by having the penny in my pocket, some other very brief irrelevant fun thing happened in my pocket that was completely unrelated...and then the cops showed up and detained me about the penny...huh? What's happening?
---
Happens to me with all my automatic rifles. I use 10mm, laser, and plasma. Like with many things in this game I just suck it up, but it’s really testing my patience.
---
Or just no Online Fallout games?
---
The series about isolation and survival gains nothing from a multiplayer experience.
---
The Tyler County Fairgrounds has large rusted Nuka Cola bottle with a cola booth at its base. There are usually three or four of them there.
---
Farewell, wanderer. Try to barge in from time to time to see whether or not the game has changed to your liking.
---
So you finally made your own 🥳🥳
---
Don't worry! When a 3* drops it will be an Assassin's board or tire iron anyways.
---
Yes sirr
---
SS is the best imo. Great stats and cheap to repair. (No ballistic fiber).
---
Try equipping white knight!
---
It's super annoying Always happens on the laser Gatling
---
Those long blocks of silence are really telling. Saying nothing at all can sometimes say everything. If the devs were proud of what they’re building, we would be getting tons of dialogue and insights. You see this with other games but with 76, things come and go with very little fanfare. That alone speaks volumes. 
---
The lack of direction was something I felt immediately when I got this game. I love sandboxy but it just felt... barren. I think it’s better now and I might revisit it because I like the community, but the difficulty of some of the enemies and the constant super low quality gear I was finding deterred me.
---
Purveyor goes out of its way to basically 1* a 3* by making it a level 45.
---
Yep. I think it's cool that they *tried* an online Fallout, but it's obvious that it just doesn't work nearly as well as the single player titles. BGS are great at making single-player Fallout titles, no need to "hand it over to Obsidian".
---
I wish people did Project Paradise. I usually end up running just Habitat A solo.
---
Ma’am 😜
---
Can the camo SS underarmor be favorited for NW?
---
for what I recall he is talking about his friend the friend that wanted the pet back and you had to get the nany robot to help him heal couse he was bad so evebory confused on the end when he talks about the funeral
---
thats why we have teams.
---
you can loot their kills.
---
I think rather than a multiplayer game, I think it should be coop, and have a couple of people per world, maybe 6 max. Tgat way I think in general there would be less lag, they could focus on content easier aswell
---
I don't think I've seen a wanted player in months
---
Ahhh, sorry😬
---
3 day old troll account checks out.
---
Most bloodied builds (a large percentage of the playerbase it would seem) will have serendipity which gives them a flat 45% chance to simply avoid the damage. And many players have Fireproof, which greatly reduces aoe damage taken. So even if they get hit, its unlikely to hurt badly.
---
Yes!!!! Definitely this.
---
So you didn’t go with the hate Ward one 🔫🔫🔫🤯
---
The Legendary Run is literally the same challenges that have always been in the game with a fresh coat of paint and a psychological impetus to make you think you need to do them. Don't be a sucker, if you don't want to do them, dont.
---
I just logged in after not playing for months and remembered I stopped playing because of this 10 cap bounty that wasn’t letting me purchase anything. 
---
Solution? Kill myself. And then I made this post:p
---
Edit: I still have the 10 cap bounty.
---
You gotta understand😅😅 he used to glitch so much
---
It's a range of 200 meters, so anything close by would be worth it
---
Explosive (25% faster fire rate would be even better). 33% hit chance does not work as most people think it does. It does not change your chance to hit from lets say, 50% to 83%, instead it increases the hit chance you already have by that 33%, meaning 50% will become 66.5% (or in game terms 66 or 67). So it is not that great of an effect. Especially if you use *concentraded fire* perk.
---
I just wander around and do different things each day. Some days I CAMP build, some days I go shopping b at player vendors, some days I event hop. I change it up to do whatever I’m feeling that day. Most recently, I’ve been trying to complete the scout badges just by wandering around the forest looking for critters to take pictures of
---
Still does for me. Nothing’s changed and I still want to kill him.
---
Very impressive!
---
lol!
---
Idk, that's what I'm asking you guys. But it just says takes live grenade from your inventory. So imma assume its random unless you have just one type of grenade. This is why we need to experiment with this
---
I was fighting a pair of L80 one-star bats the other day and this little golden sob came up behind and insulted me during the fight.
---
Players would gather signs and riot in the streets of Appalachia if Bethesda had the balls to do something like that. Lots of people say the same thing about speed demon and marsupial, but i just feel it ruins the game for me. I don’t find the game very difficult to begin with and lots of these mutations just feel like cheat codes. Would it be nice to be able to jump on a high ledge to escape swarms of enemies? You bet your ass it would, but I can’t, so I’ve got to take my time and plan my actions and make sure I’ve got a back up plan in case shit goes south, I’ve got to find the best point of entry and egress cause I can’t sprint around like Usain Bolt. Not playing with mutations adds something to the game for me.
---
I personally don't care for it. I've got a jffr and I'm a junkies heavy gunner. I just don't ever seem to pull it out
---
Oh helll yes
---
To be honest, I threw down a couple more of these "mines" and I still don't really know what the hell they are supposed to be doing. They seem to explode immediately (with a very brief white pixelated effect). They seem to function like a grenade (explode immediately), not a mine (creature has to run into it to trigger) which is why I called it a grenade, from memory...I don't even know if they do damage. There is also zero color, indicating they aren't fireworks either? I mean I guess there are some all white fireworks?? So ummm, yeah...
---
Awww man
---
If they would've just went full-blown MMO the game would've been amazing.  
---
Many of it's short-comings are because they are trying to make it for single players and people who want to play with others.  Trying to cater to both crowds just gives you watered down aspects from both types of game that leaves quite a bit to be desired.
---
Aa is not great in heavys since you should be using stabilzed anyway. And aa still does no work properly on energy weapons. So it's not great
---
🤣🤣I have got to the point where I just don’t visit him anymore
---
Duude you're a vet like me :D How can you think that explosive breaks stealth? :D It absolutely does not :) I have played with explosive weapon for hundreds of hours (most likely 1000+) on my commando and i have NEVER seen it break stealth.
---
thanks
---
And the only other post is about being banned for duping.
---
Now I really want to visit there, thanks for sharing!
---
*Getting* ridiculous? It's been ridiculous since shortly after launch...
---
Balanced, as all things should be.
---
you'd love to play War Thunder then
---
My last 10 SBQ fights I got all the 1\* and 3\* crap like rolling pins, bone club and golf club.  Yesterday I got a Bloodied 3\* Pipe Pistol.  Okay so its Bloodied but is it still crap?
---
I use a bow/melee exclusively unless I’m killing scorch beasts/SBQ or other boss type enemies where the Dps just doesn’t cut it. All my weapons are mutant based and I have a M/E/+1P .50 cal for those fights.
---
It happens to core weapons at 50% and 25% remaining every time all the gatlings laser and plasma,
---
killing yourself doesn't work, someone has to kill you.
---
Then again if like it to use the most empty core first so I wouldnt be carrying around 300
---
I had a bounty on me for some dumb accident and it was really annoying but I finally found another player and said hi and just stood there, and they killed me a few seconds later and when I respawned I thanked them lmao.
---
It's a public event, it's free for anyone to join, and for a lot of newer players one of the only real resources for reliable legendaries. If your worried about people stealing your kills get Fo1st go play in a private server and play solo. The kills are first come first serve, if someone beats you to that kill, oh well. Server hop or if your higher level go farm scorchbeasts, mutants, or ghouls. The advice is was giving was more for players with limited options or lower levels.
---
For higher level players I'd suggest West Tek Recearch Center, 1 to 3 runs though and you'll almost always get 3 legendaries. Or just run the Fissures south of watoga and around the prime fissure, you won't get legendaries from the scorched, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 25% of the scorchbeasts will likely be legendary, also I've commonly run into a legendary sheepsquach in the area, as well as a legendary assaultron and mirelurk king. Going west of prime to 2 fissures and back.
---
It does not break stealth, Baronik is wrong about that.
---
Well technically killing yourself doesn’t clear your wanted status so I’m not sure where you’re getting that idea. As far as the being killed part, if you don’t want to be killed by another player don’t get a wanted status. It’s a very simple system that really doesn’t need any expansion. Out of the ever growing list of things that could be fixed or added this would have to be at the near bottom of it. Wanted players deserve death, be it a merciful one or a fight to the bloody end.
---
*this is the way*
---
If you don’t like exploring, wandering, fighting bad guys along the way then this game might not be for you. I find it cathartic.
---
Or just do a mainline game where one or two friends can join you. It’s sates the story lovers and those who like to play with friends.
---
&gt; Thats an evil option that the player has, for a quartermaster breaking regs (you can ask him if its an sanctioned op and he will be evasive)
---
Huh, thanks for informing me. I would have assumed that proctor Teagan, a man with multiple years with the brotherhood, wouldn’t just straight up ask a brand-new recruit to abuse the brotherhood’s name (likely off the books so they likely don’t even know about it/aren’t sanctioning it) in order to threaten settlements for resources.
---
It’s just like, “hey kid, want to do some very illegal and morally wrong work for me?” And I’m kind of just confused. Because if this ISN’T allowed by the brotherhood, why is this seasoned quartermaster asking this new recruit to do illegal and immoral work? I mean, the sole survivor, as a normal person, would likely immediately report him for telling him. He’s putting a lot of trust in the player to not report him for what he’s asking you to do.
---
It also doesn’t help that he’s asking about this in the Prydwen, in a not exactly inconspicuous place, with, almost 100% of the time, several scribes and knights walking around, so he seems to be a rather badly designed character in the first place, asking you this stuff in broad daylight likely surrounded by other brotherhood members.
---
Thanks to you both. I learn a lot today. 😊
---
Before anyone comments "just make three star enemies drop three star gear" that doesn't fix One and Two star enemies from being trash loot lol
---
you mean like a emote? couse would be weird to talk to my walls wile afk on my camp.
---
How do you already know what the coming seasons will be about?
---
What keeps me playing is my sister and I are both Fallout fans and having an online version to play together makes it so much fun. We do various side quests, compete with each other, work towards getting the gear we want and with public teams met many fun people to play with as well. My character is over 600+ level and with nearly 2,500 hours in I still find new things to collect and still enjoy the game. If I feel a tad bored, I just switch games for a bit. I always recommend to mix the grinding up with side quests, clearing out various dungeons/locations, and play around with the public teams, build a new camp, try out a new build or improve on your own.
---
What's it matter what other people do? Most join teams just for the boosts. You shouldn't expect others to come play with you on them. There's not many events out there you should be needing help with anyway
---
i was doing the free range event a few days ago solo, and dealing with herding the cows and incoming wolves. then out of the corner of my eye, i see that bastard making his way out of the brush from behind me. didnt have time to listen to his insult, had to put him down.
---
The Enclave problem is that the Enclave in WV aren't just gone, they were specifically murdered (mostly) by Modus. That, and the Congressional Bunker appears to have been intentionally cut off from the network.
---
As for the BOS, [decrypting the radio messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gyd9db/all_transmissions_decoded_an_update_on_patch_20s/) revealed a few things that ought to make the BOS a lot more interesting. On a final note, I would say that it's arguably weirder that the Brotherhood would say and do nothing after losing contact with the WV Chapter, given they were fighting a literal apocalyptic threat that *did* successfully wipe out all human life in Appalachia. Even if it's a bit of a stretch, why wouldn't you make sure that the world's not going to end in a decade or two when the bats make their way to the West Coast?
---
If in the land of the blind a one-eyed man is king, then in a land of machine guns, a man with a bow is decidedly not. 
---
That said, I do have a lot of fun with the bow, it just doesn’t have the DPS to be a primary build weapon.
---
You are taking this WAAAY too seriously. If it bothers you that much, just kick people. No one cares or gets butthurt about being dropped from a public team. Grandstanding about it on the internet just makes you seem like an asshole.
---
Absolutely, I'm not saying that its not dangerous to leave, but that doesn't change the fact that you have to fight if you want to live.
---
All you have to do is strip and find another player and they'll do you in, it's no big whoop. I killed my husband the other day to clear his. All he had to do was leave the team and stand still and then we just rejoined and moved on. Yes, it would be cool to be able to pay bounties a la RDR, but that would remove one of the only 2 chances for legit PvP in Adventure mode if they did, and I think PvP people would throw a fit. (Maybe not, though, Idk for sure, because I am PvE exclusively besides NW)
---
I mean, it is your right to kick anyone from your team if you are the leader.  However, just be aware that many people join teams just for the XP buffs.  I always look for a building team as my first choice but if it is not available I will just join the next available team no matter what the type of team is because I just want the inspirational bonus.
---
Would prefer if it was 12 AM MNL Time, which would be 12 NN ET I think. Same time as daily challenges.
---
I run full health, so I vend my bloody. I sold my three star for pipe pistol for 3K within seconds of putting it in. I should have marked it way up.
---
It's still a nice drop!
---
I consistently find them in the machines a lot. From just 1-5 granted, I don't know if high luck factors in but I don't remember seeing this many before switching to a Bloodied build.
---
All good man! We are glad to help out :)
---
Stupid russian hackers just trying to bring us all down..... ;)
---
I’ll have to look into it. I don’t really know a lot of ppl that have junkie builds but my junkie weapons always sell well. Were you not able to fit ricochet into your junkie build prev? 
---
are you able to get along well without any of the major legendary perks? You could also try 5x auto-revive or auto-stim armor which would basically assure you are never downed unless you’re more worried about the rads then boosting your stats or weight reduc
---
I wish that instead of 9 perks to up damage we had a paerk that decreased the nock time for arrows.
---
I main a Berserker Archer. I absolutely love it except in mob areas. When I'm doing SBQ I will switch over to my skills and weapon to Ber FFR HM because VATS on a bow is not as good due to the projectile speed.
---
I mean, why would it be fair for a 1* or a 2* to drop 3* gear when they are easier to kill than a 3*.
---
Bows are very poorly implemented which is probably why they don’t get more widespread steady use. Aiming is extremely awkward and buggy. Plus why can’t I have a giant improvised PA only bow that fires javelins??? They are more of a novelty.
---
It still is. I'm willing to bet the majority of players don't min-max the daily resets and would rather have a scheduled reset like the daily challenges.
---
It’s not “the way”. It’s part of the forced PVP Bethesda shoehorned into the game. Most of the community didn’t want PVP and this bounty thing is just a sad part of that garbage. Just turn it off already.
---
I understand this but again you get more XP for being on a building team, events team just gives more xp for completing events with a full bond. Once events are done I switch back to building, it’s really not rocket science
---
My point is that they are all linked.  The push for more monetization is a direct link to the fact the game failed.  If the game had released with all these monetization elements, then I would agree.  (The design element of limited stash does have some merit in a multiplayer game - regardless of monetization, but that’s a different story).  At the start, it really as just cosmetics - picture frames, outfits (with dirty versions usually in the game), player icons.    
---
Over time they went in heavier - we started getting things like the collectron and the fridge, minor player benefits.  Then the scrap kits and repair kits.  Then Fallout 1st.  Now we have the removal of atoms from dailies/weeklies and the score system.  
---
It just reeks to me of people desperate to meet some metric.
---
And again, you can’t compare an offline game to an online one, there are a lot of different factors to consider.   One game was a one and done push out to players and they buy it with hopes of selling some DLC later. This was supposed to be a living game working off the cosmetic purchases and game purchases. It was experiemental they didn’t even have their primary team do it.  It was a team trying to make an outdated engine now become a multiplayer engine (which I sure is where a ton of the development costs went)   How many refunds did people request after this game came out?  How about the refunds after a year?  Shoot we have people who duped and got banned now trying to get refunds on all the atoms they ever bought on the game.
---
Then the xp bonus drops if you kick them thus defeating the purpose of a full team. I actually can't do Radiation Rumble as it messes with my pc. No idea why. It just does (and yes I have a pc powerful enough to play this game on ultra) I will do low level easy events. Events teams are great. I don't care what you do. If you do show up to an event though don't be a lawn chair and do nothing.
---
At higher lvls we all do
---
Yeah, I had to log off finally after only getting 2. This is one of my least favorite NW challenges, because they are nowhere to be found when you need them!
---
I prefer the daily challenge reset schedule right now, though. It's literally the start of the day for my timezone.
---
There's no difference between a 1 and a 3 star except a 1* has bad loot
---
What exactly did you expect with the first craft? BFFR90? (:
---
I would love to use the bow. My keyboard set up sadly makes them too clunky to use.
---
I did see one guy use a bow with I think exploding rounds in a 'lure the scorchbeast' event. That was an amazing thing to watch
---
Again, you get more XP for being on a building team, events team just gives xp for completing events so it makes no sense to be in an events team while farming when you can be in a building team and get twice the amount of XP. You’re just an idiot
---
I haven't finished Beckett's quest yet, but I wrapped up the main Wastelanders quest last week or so and noticed Jen's mom and the ghoul secret service agent were both talked about like they were killed even though they both survived. :/
---
I was wondering if it had something to do with how I exited out of the dialogue to boost up my Charisma to make the checks, but that's just a wild guess...?
---
Heavy trapper looks the best and second is heavy raider
---
Also in this proposed Utopia, there would be no stars on enemies. They would just be Legendary. I know it's hard to imagine
---
I'll say this on pretty much any post complaining that the strangler PA is terrible
---
It used to be brilliant. But because beth cant work out what PC modders worked out (probably a year ago now)
---
They just nerfed it into the ground, rather than remove the particle effects which would have fixed a ton of the lag issues
---
Her real name was "Crash Bandicoot" and 🤣
---
What causes the nodes to respawn? I've been trying to collect enough to get the plans, but the most I've gathered alone is 60.
---
Because they're incompetent. Yes, I get it programming is a difficult job. But they suck so much at handling their product that they keep breaking the game more than they're fixing it.
---
Brush did you just compare a video game to an abusive relationship lmao
---
Yo I feel you man, I just logged in to the exact same screen. https://youtu.be/dKcTfrfbOWs
---
Why do you think Obsidian would do any better - they aren't exactly known for online MMO's.
---
So I turned down my graphics one notch last night and the RR garage door started functioning correctly. Haven't had time to retest because work and shit. If someone else wants to give it a shot and lemme know your results that'd be cool. Was on Ultra bumped it down to High.
---
Edit: The change was unrelated to the door. Loads were too damn long. Just happened to notice.
---
What paint is that on the power armor? It looks like Atom Cats but I didnt think that was available
---
YAWN...Another one of those - I HATE this game soooooo much!!
---
And yet claims to play it anyway. 
---
Simple answer - don't play, don't post, crawl out from under you bridge and get a life.
---
I don’t think you quite understand the meaning of “forced”. You’re implying that you are forced to become wanted and thus be swept into a PvP engagement when that’s simply not true. You become wanted through your own actions. No one is forcing you into anything
---
I honestly don't know but I think that it is random(per node) after a certain amount of time has passed from first collecting it.
---
33 is the best imho because of the insane headshot damage and because of the flying scorchbeasts/queen.
---
So you've purposely gone for a broken overpowered build and intentionally gone bloodied, and then you have a sook about it?
---
Here's a fix, don't run a bloodied build.
---
As for a .45 doing more damage than a .50 when sneaking, this game isnt a military simualtor. Dont whinge about issues like that when they really aren't issues, it you expecting this game to be something its not. Go play Arma or Insurgency if thats what you want.
---
Even at level 250+, I can gain a level in about an hour if I decide that’s what I want to focus on. 
---
If you’re leveling up for the weekly/daily, make an alt and kit it out with solid starting gear and do one level up each day. Should take only about 5-10 minutes if you focus.
---
Bash a Ghoul at night you mean
---
yep, did that today also. just some minutes after start a lvl 70ish joined and didnt collect a single venture. so we had one habitat 2/3 (also, i died once. quite new to bloody and that ant was hidden in the river :D) but its okay, i like the secluded area and variety of enemies.
---
I have often joked that whatever the "Kill X" creature of the day is suddenly becomes the least common creature in the wasteland. I can't even count how many places in the Ash Heap had Super Mutants, ghouls, or friggin' robots yesterday.
---
Also, it took me four matches to find three creatures in NW yesterday. So yeah - I'm with you on the odd rarity issue.
---
whoa no liking the game here pal, thats gamer treason.
---
Did you watch Angry Turtle's latest PTS video? On it, bloodied lifegiver has been fixed but Psychobuff now grants infinite rad resistance lol
---
Yeah but at the end of the day I love the glitchers and Mr Big Dicks who kill the SBQ in five seconds--I've got range on my Fixer and deal enough damage before the bitch gets up close and then she dies fast to these peeps. Like, FAST. I used like a handful of rounds in 3x fights tonight and got max rewards... 
---
One might say I'm a bottom feeder... I'll respond with 'where's the plankton?' OP players/groups have upsides too!
---
That's good to know, I carry a few bloodied weapons but not interested in a pipe pistol.
---
Correct. Elder Lyons hasn’t even been born yet, and his expedition to the Capitol won’t arrive for another hundred years.
---
I like how you didn't respond to me [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hzmhsc/beth_sent_me_a_forum_warning_because_telling/fzkpf46/?context=3).
---
That’s not true. 2* takes more to kill than a 1*, 3* takes more to kill than a 2*.
---
Okay, makes sense then.  I need to go back and read up on my FO lore.
---
Imagine what the game could be if Bethesda stepped it up and started acting like a professional company.
---
I used the analogy for shock factor, and also because it helps others realize that you need to back up and have a more distant viewpoint in order to see problems better.
---
You're a bold man asking for a nerf of the most popular build in the game on this sub.
---
Nerfs are never fun in games.  No one wants to log in after a patch and have their character be made less powerful overnight.  
---
That being said, we have some insanely powerful builds on our characters and we will only get more powerful with legendary perks etc.  In any MORPG game I would probably say it is time for a few nerfs.  However, it's not even like we have any end-game progression content where this stuff even matters.  There is no raid or dungeon where players actually need to use their min-max builds to push high scores.  The game being imbalanced really doesn't matter right now because the entire game is face-roll easy with even non meta builds.  
---
They have talked in the past about doing a "balance pass" on the game but it has never materialized.  Who knows if it ever will.  If we actually get some real end game progression content for groups I wouldn't mind some standardization to balance the game a bit.  But for now, I guess it's not a big deal.
---
I’m lvl 298 now and it takes me 30~ minutes to level if I hit my main leveling spots.
---
I use unyielding, relish, brain fungus soup, and sleep xp.
---
When double was happening I was leveling like 10 times a day in the couple of hours I played. It was insane.
---
I clearly don’t see how you feel leveling is slow at all unless your just staying in flat woods with all the level 1s mobs.
---
I one-shot everything so I don't really notice I guess lol
---
Yes but what does it matter to you, personally. You still get the bonded bounse whether or not the other members on your team are doing events. They don't need to be at your event for you to get the bounse. So by kicking them you are limiting the xp you will be getting.
---
No need to bring insults in either. I was trying to have a discussion
---
Maybe they are just wanting to help someone get an extra 25% more XP from the events they’re doing, and doesn’t care about getting more XP themselves. 
---
You seem awfully upset about someone helping **you** get 25% more XP from the events you want to run.
---
Fyi there is not really something to maintain with a junkies build. just get hooked for the stuff you want and then never take addictol end of story
---
 Nothing in Whitesprings? And can I ask, why do you want the plans for?
---
They get roasted, yes, but not nearly enough. All those people who continue to defend Bethesda need to admit TO THEMSELVES that they're being used and abused.
---
There is nothing wrong with liking the game but insisting that all these issues are kind of normal for all games and that we're just a hateful minority is extremely bullshit. 
---
There were people on here who got banned (pending investigation because they did nothing wrong) and still came on here whining that the ban means that they'll miss out on Atom Store items. Jesus christ...
---
So yeah, money is all that matters.
---
I turn off all radios that is that annoying girls talking. the o there is enjoyable.
---
Ha! Looks great!
---
My girlfriend loves the Atom Cats paint so on the T-60 we're currently using the 'CPPR - Classic Power Armor Paintjob Replacer' mod from the Nexus which means it's only visible to us but that's fine for screenshots.
---
The Troubleshooter's KNIFE 3 Star also with 90% Reduced weight and Quad ammo capacity on a KNIFE is simply moronic.
---
I like to imagine you as Kirk, seconds before he screams "KHAAAAAAAAAN!"
---
You're right however if there is no building team available I just join what is available.  I don't like to form my own because unless I am on a world with friends I tend to server hop after 30 minutes to an hour or even less so I want my inspirational XP from the get go as opposed to making my own team and having to wait and see if anyone joins.  I get your frustrations but I'm just letting you know other folks probably aint gonna see it that way.
---
People have thrown money at their broken, oudated, bug ridden tech for years. Why should they test? People keep playing and spending regardless. 
---
If you want to change it, stop giving them money.
---
They seem like companies that I've worked for in the past.  Everything is focused on deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline deadline and only minimal effort is put into making sure that things are correct before they're released.
---
I'm in management now, so I fight this attitude when people come to me with it.  There's no point in releasing something that's wrong.  Stop worrying so much about WHEN and start worrying more about WHAT.
---
I'm getting tired of doing 90% of an event by myself. Then tons of people show up at the end to kill the legendary thing and I get nothing.
---
The damage appears the same but the health bar goes from steady decline to massive drops. I always thought it was that somehow the limb damage was triggering executioner, even though the actual health bar was still far above the 40%. I wish I could give numbers, but I just can’t keep up with a minigun rocking an accelerated barrel. I can also say I rolled and rolled on a guass TS/Crippling 2* and it also seems to trigger the effect so long as, link another poster said, I concentrate all my hits to a single body part. Now that you’ve asked I’ll pay attention and see if I can capture the effect on video.
---
It's my preferred 2 hand weapon. And I can't seem to find any that are higher level than 10, and I'm level 37.
---
As I was posting this someone came to my camp to cap me, so it’s back to normal for now. I’d still love to see some alternative ways to deal with being wanted 😊
---
I noticed the same thing yesterday evening.
---
That's why I said "in any worthwhile sense".  If I equip a perk card, then I'm exploiting that card.  If I fire a gun, I'm exploiting the gun.  If I even just press the run key, I'm exploiting that capability in the program.  That doesn't mean it's worthwhile to call those things 'exploits'.
---
And equipping a trail mine follows the same logic.
---
War. War never changes.
---
i got home late, around 8:30 or so and decided i wasnt going to play.  i had a long day and i had to get up at 5:30 in the morning.
---
I knew the only reason i was playing was to grind the legendary run, but last night, i didnt have it in me. 
---
So now Im even FURTHER behind.  
---
is what it is.
---
I'm not sure if it is true but I heard a faster reload time trait on a weapon will really increase the nock time. I'm still hunting one to confirm though.
---
Even if your team doesn’t join you for team events. You are still getting the xp for team events. 
---
Some people just join a team to get the credit and bonuses on being on a team. Doesn’t mean they are dedicated and dying to complete every single even they see pop up. 
---
You can always kick people out if you don’t want them there. I usually create my intelligence team. So we get xp for everything we do. And then when I join an event, regardless if my team is there or not, I switch to events.
---
Gotcha. Yeah definitely hit up Whitesprings and check all the vendor bots there.
---
Personally Im a big fan of the BoS, I’m kind of a sucker for power armor and advanced technology (I like the Enclave a lot too for the same reason, but like the Brotherhood more just cuz the pseudo-knightly shit appeals to me more) but I still agree. I don’t necessarily mind them being in every game since they’re essentially the mascots of the franchise at this point, but I do wish they’d stop getting center stage. I don’t really mind so much here since 76 is a effectively an MMO so bringing back one of the most popular and iconic factions makes a lot of sense, but in future titles if they HAVE to appear personally I wish it’d be in smaller roles, like their appearance in FNV.
---
That was my big hope for the repeated vendor dupe glitches, that they would act as avoidance training. Each new glitch, sometimes discovered within minutes of the last patch going live was like a slap in the face. Check your work, check your work... 
---
Unfortunately, they blamed the "dirty dupers" rather than their own shoddy work.

---
So basicly.. Grahm (rare wandering super mutant merchant) is the only vendor that sells the plan. But you can find it in Toxic Valley random weapon plan spawn locations if you are very very lucky.
---
That's sucks dude. I'm a couple spaces from getting that tree and I'm going to be on here probably with the same issue. 😂
---
Might have to put in a ticket for what it's worth, I know.
---
I was under the impression that bows cant be legendary. I have never seen one anywhere.
---
I had to kill the legendary yesterday before others could and I’m sorry. But some asshat with a fixer had insta killed the two miners before and he was full autoing in to the last. I got a zealots wood left leg. I wasn’t proud but I scripted it and then bought a legendary and made a SS arm which was unyielding. I’m still very shamefully wearing it.
---
If you cancel the reload animation (usually I di this by starting to run), the gun will continue to fire the remaining rounds. 
---
We shouldn't have to do this but that's a different story...
---
Glad im not the only one Queen fights are infuriating with this bug
---
I have a few. It's all RNG at the purveyor but you need to learn the plans first from the WL story line.
---
Uhm no. Take out bloodied completely and you’re still overpowered being low health and sneak and non legendary pipe rifle. I play around with my build all the time I don’t even use bloodied weapons anymore because it’s ridiculous.  My main gripe is sneak damage. Full health, non legendary rifle plus sneak and you still wreck everything. What’s the point in legendary weapons and high dmg builds if it’s not even necessary? This could be fixed with harder enemies or nerfing these op builds. And no I love fallout I don’t want to play other games I’ve loved every fallout since ‘98 I just have some issues with this current game.
---
I get where posts like this are coming from it's very frustrating but the reason this has gone on for so long is because of posts like this. Let me explain.
---
Everytime the issue is brought up people always complain about the assholes one shotting because their build is too strong. Wait what? Your criticizing people for using the builds they worked hard to put together. Expecting people to use shitty gear to work around a system that Bethesda has known is shit. But you keep the outrage directed as players just trying to play the game. This is 100% Bethesda fault not the players. Some of these people never even come to reddit.
---
I understand trying to come together as a community to work around this but c'mon man why did I spend all this time perfecting my build if I can't even use it when playing with other people. What's the point?
---
Like you guys mentioned I'm forced to keep my usual loadout PLUS a Tesla rifle to try and not ruin the game for others at events. I go from feeling like a god to slapping things with a wet noodle and that just isn't fun. It's kinda sad that I've begun to just prefer soloing events in my private world over even playing with other people so I can use the equipment I put all this effort into.
---
Sorry just my rant tldr blame Bethesda not the players.
---
I did too by shutting world radios off in the game settings.
---
The trick is to buy them as soon as you find out they're bugged. Then request a refund because they're bugged. Get your atoms back, keep the item.
---
To stay on top of that 20 hour reset you have to keep a very careful track and manage to log in during work and sleep hours at some stage each week.
---
While I totally agree with this. I hope that you got something out of venting. 
---
Cause here's the thing. Most of the players, the vast, vast majority of players that one shot the legendaries. They know exactly what they are doing. And they don't care about you, your game or whatever. They want the loot for whatever reason. Scrip to buy modules or steel. To sell. 
---
So reading this, I don't think they are going to stop. 
---
One thing I've taken to doing. At the start of the event, or whatever, me and my friend will switch to area chat, and talk as about who we suspect is going to 1-shot the legendary. Like at campfire tales. When the level 300+ shows up, and jumps right on top of the building, and just waits there. 
---
In most of the cases, they actually don't 1-shot the legendary. And sometimes they actually participate in the event. And then after, we'll say something like, man that was fun. I liked seeing everyone get into it. Yeah, really made for a fun event.
---
Definitely not taken seriously. I’ve avoided nw since the game released but on double xp I played and it wasn’t that bad after a joint or two. Had fun and boy the skins and camp items are rad.
---
max lvl is 45 on some weapons
---
You guys are circlejerking harder than I have ever seen. Nobody is saying OP should have his account punished, not talk about bugs, or otherwise not engage with the community/developers. OP went into a community that says we don't talk about fight club, and made a post saying "Hey guys what is all this talk about fight club". Simple as that.
---
Had OP made his thread here like this user [did last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hworhk/fast_reload_on_currently_equipped_weapon_when/), [or this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hxa4vk/trail_fireworks_mine_bug/), then it would have died into obscurity or maybe got someone to link him to another post/video that already covers this bug extensively (in the way the developers would actually respond to). If you guys really want to help as badly as you are all claiming to, then make your own [bug roundups](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/f9ukns/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/) and keep them updated. But you wont do that because its hard work, and its easy to rub one out to how wronged you all are and how everyone else is just trying to keep you down. Ironically enough the guy that enables the bug roundups to exist has since stopped coming on Reddit and playing the game, and he got a ton of his info from datamining, and Eckserah and other dataminers who is the most downvoted person in this thread. Real nice job there.
---
Sounds to me like you're on the wrong team. You should have joined the building team if you wanted to get people to do radiation rumble. Most people just use it to farm and don't have any intention of finishing it. Events team only gets extra XP when the event is successful and that one fails way too often. Sorry those guys didn't show up to carry the event for you the way you wanted.
---
Okay I can agree with that, I really doesn’t matter unless they add meaningful end game content.
---
I built a pistol character with full trapper armour with the hope of going into nuke zones.....
---
The disappointment I got can still be felt this day....
---
Gf and I were doing low level events on my private server because the two events that popped up were too hard for us two to complete on our own. 
---
We ended up doing distinguished guests. Jail break. Manhunt. The messenger. And tea time. 
---
When I decided to check my apparel I noticed I got the BOS jumpsuit. Whitespring jumpsuit. White jumpsuit. Forest mask. Scout mask. And firefighters outfit. 
---
And no, I didn’t get them from before and forgot about them. The only apparel I carry on me is my Piper Wright outfit. My full unyielding armor. And my underarmor. 
---
I didn’t have anything like that the day before. But I did after doing those events with her. 
---
So I’m guessing try to do one of those events and maybe you’ll get one?
---
And miss out on the whopping 8 scrip a day🤪
---
Lol shut up loser
---
Also works well for the Space Explorer backpack (and likely the Seasonal variants.
---
https://i.imgur.com/3Ir0l40.png
---
there is no such thing as heavy trapper - Trapper armor in F76 is only in one variant, sturdy.
---
The faster reload legendary cant be found on bows.
---
And while they are at it, they should just give us legendary gear for simply logging in. I don't want to work for anything.
---
Shit is supposed to be rare. It's bad enough that these 3 star enemies can be pretty much one shot.
---
Pretty sure it's all random man
---
Thanks for the info.  I also sell ammo as my main source of caps and plan on getting the ammo machine once I finish getting my raider rep to max. I think I have 1 1/2 lvls to go yet :(. 
---
I have been on the lookout for a junkies heavy weapon to try it out.  I tried a bloodied build but just died all the time.
---
100% agree.  I joined a group where all 4 of us were lvl 150+.  Rumble came up and I kept sending out the follow me emote since there were only 2 of us at the event.  I must have annoyed them because 2 quit the group and the third never came.  The event failed.
---
Yeah like I said I kind of agree with you but it's hard for me to even find the time to think about game balance when I CTD 4 times a night.  Hope you don't get downvoted too much,
---
Take his Advice, come back in a few months.
---
Oh okay, but all SPECIALs can eventually be leveled to 15?
---
That would ruin my enjoment of the game, i like working for what i get.
---
Interesting!
---
They have seemed screwy lately, different since the last update at least.
---
That would explain why I couldn't find any. Thank you. Now I can stop hunting for it.
---
Hack the planet!
---
It doesn't let u farm ghouls anymore. If you don't progress the sound bar pass half it ends it
---
What system are you on?
---
I mean I see both sides of this. I’ve def had to hop servers an annoying amount of times to just FIND a half decent team who will actually go through events for a short time. Not that I expect people to grind just events the whole time, I get it’s everyone’s game, but to keep joining or making event teams just for literal kids to hang at my camp for 40 minutes or ask for random stuff does get frustrating. And still I understand that it’s not my game to tell other people how to play cause the game itself is pretty ambiguous. I think it might be rude for me to ask others to knock off what their doing on their game to do whatever, but if you join an event team and within an hour don’t do any events or anything, then just why?
---
I saw a Hulking Mama Sloth and two dead babby sloths that were all killed by a pair of deathclaws. I murdered the deathclaws. Justice was served. But it will never bring back those babby sloths.
---
RIP friends.
---
/salut
---
I’ll start collecting the T-65 plans while I wait to get my raider faction up to get the ammo machine.
---
Are you able to confirm that E does not break stealth?
---
Lvl 477 here, and it takes a bit more now to lvl up. if that's not what I'm focusing on at the moment.
---
They actually *were* solid, it got broken about 2 months ago
---
Why waste money on testing when they can have us suckers do it for them for free?
---
Yeah I switched from bloodied to junkies quite awhile ago and I  don't miss in the slightest.
---
That rep grind is a huge pain.
---
Id recommend a junkies ult gat laser if you can get one, preferably with ffr, but even a 1* would be a good start. Super ammo efficient. If you run power user r3 you get 1k rounds from a core. And if you prime it, 1 flux, 1 ultracite, and 2 cores. Will make you 3 cores and what ever extra you get from super duper.
---
Shouldn't be.
---
It’s sweet and the dps is awesome but it eats ammo like there is so tomorrow
---
I'm at level 330 or so but I took a break from the end of July 19' until the Halloween event.  I then played for a few months and took another break from January 20' until about March 20'. Currently taking a little break and logging in once in awhile to buy bullion and do a few challenges.  I just don't find the Legendary run very compelling since I already completed Wastelanders and got max reputation with the factions.  
---
The game is so much more fun when you have friends to play with.  Building camps and such and doing events. I think the public teams could really be great with a few tweaks and improvements.  Right now though I am just tired of running the same content with nothing really to gain.  Waiting on the BOS update and the legendary perks, etc.
---
Ah. We were a little past halfway up the noise bar. Maybe we weren't fast enough.
---
My 2000+ hours in game says it can't. Never witnessed it breaking stealth. Like ever. And i use one all the time with my stealth commando. And it's kinda common knowledge that it doesn't.
---
Got my outfit and helmet from some low level
---
'seem like'? 🤣
---
Since Wastelanders, you've got 10 minutes from the time you ENTER the Bucks Den Beer House. You've got 10 minutes to attract the Nightstalker. If you don't manage to make enough ruckus to attract it, the event will fail, despite having remaining time on the event. I think that 'remaining time' is what you initially had to get there and actually start the event.
---
If you're going there and waiting for other people to join, wait outside for your friends to show up, or you'll start the event as soon as you walk inside.
---
There are two timers - one (the original 25 minute one), doesn't matter anymore. You need to pay attention to the second time - which only gives you 8 minutes to complete the event.
---
After 10 crafted gauss miniguns, the best I got is a 2 star legendary:  
---
Faster movement Speed when aiming  
---
\+10% damage when aiming  
---
I haven't even modded it yet because I keep expecting something better. It does great damage though, but who knows
---
What are you, Twelve? xD
---
That’s what I’m trying to say, it makes no sense to create an events team and I just see everyone hanging out in their camp or doing something else. They join events team to do zero events
---
To build the best camp ever.
---
Soloing the queen is still a goal, need to dedicate a character to melee, in the works.
---
Ah, okay. Thank you.
---
Oh im dumb then nvm
---
Sweet, maybe I'll finally find a red asylum uniform.
---
Names with only hexadecimal characters and all the same long length. (Hex chars, 0-9 a-f).

I was doing the daily for Crater last night and ended up at the red rocket workshop where the dude was and did a little looting while I was there. Pick locked a safe and instantly became wanted for 10 caps. I was like what the actual fuck...and then realized the workshop was owned by someone (they didn't put any resource extractors out that I could see and the map was doing that glitch where workshops don't show up as workshops so you don't know they're owned). To be fair, I would have looted that safe even if I knew the workshop was owned bc I wouldn't have thought it would make me wanted (lesson learned). Went to a nuke event shortly after and someone kindly killed me so I could clear the wanted status. I would like to see an alternative way to clear minor wanted levels (i.e. pay off a bounty, do some "karma clearing" event similar to being sentenced to community service, etc) because of the five or so times I've become wanted, it was never intentional. I don't really enjoy messaging people "accidentally wanted, plz kill me" lol
---
Yeah i’ve had that happen lots at an event, I get a tag in, I emote come over and the next guy blows it away.
---
I think I saw a Ghost Hunters episode that was filmed there years ago.  Definitely a cool location.
---
It is killing me on my fusion cores. I hope they get this fixed at some point. I'm annoyed at have questions 20+ cores with 50 rounds left in them if I'm lucky. 🙄
---
8 months? Wastelanders came out 3 months ago dude
---
So many cool opportunities for events!  This would be amazing.
---
I didn't say it wasn't and I agree, great event for everyone high or low but especially low. But I have also seen high levels show up. We all know these 3 ledengaries a day is a tedious daily. Also west tec does not always spawn legendaries, for the last 4 times I have gone thru west tec, only once did it have 2 legendaries. As far as I am concerned legendaries have been nerfed in general and you probably only find them more commonly in events than in the wild. I am not saying they don't spawn, of course they do, but I am not the type of player they just goes from one location to the next killing enemies although I have done this when I am on a public team only to be disappointed not to find many legendaries. Even at white spring I rarely see legendaries anymore.
---
What I am saying, is if somebody is doing leader of the pack, high or low, don't go kill a legendary when you know very well they likely doing it for the daily.
---
The only time I think it is ok if you under level 20 and don't know any better. I don't consider a level 50 a low level. That event pops up all the time, just wait for another event. Anyway personally if I see someone doing leader of the pack, I will not go steal a legendary from that person.
---
What the bloody hell are you talking about?
---
Yeah, that's why I thought there was no difference between a 1 and 3 star lol, they die in the same length of time.
---
Personally I don't need anything that a legendary enemy would drop. Got a BE Gatling Plasma, B25 Plasma Caster B33 Gauss shotgun, B40 Gauss Minigun, BE Gauss Rifle, B2525 Fixer, BSS Sledgehammer, BSS combat Knife, BPA Gauntlet... Pretty much 3* bloodied god rolls of any weapon type except pistols. Just gotta grind for some armor and I've got pretty much everything I could want
---
Just trying to up the game's quality of life because it's pretty much the only complaint people have about the system besides diversity.
---
The first time I built a Gauss shotgun on my main I got a 3 star two shot. Not great but still pretty good.
---
In an hour? Please tell me how? Lol I’ve just turned 220 and it’s a struggle to level up unless I get some SBQ events lol I normally use play an instrument, pop a leader bobblehead and also sleep on a bed prior to playing the game. Normal places I go are west tek, whitespring, and my 3 gold bullion dailies. Then it’s just whatever events happen on the map.
---
Not bold/brave, most agree Bloodied is OP and was never designed to be used as is. Add sneak buffs to it and it's even worse
---
I often don't play that way deliberately to add more challenge/fun, when you see an enemy and it's virtually  like "press this button to win"...that's not fun
---
You could probably post on marketplace and have someone build you a couple as well. Until you find a decent legendary
---
it has nothing to do with the purveyor..
---
mumbles gives items at the max level a player can use..
---
I don't really get why you're being downvoted and I understand your frustration. However, it is true that some events like Radiation Rumble and Line in the Sand are better if you're in a building team. Still sucks when noone from the events team shows up to do an event tho. Have you tried using emotes?
---
I did the same thing. Felt bad and everyone in the group gave me the frowny faces...I was like OOPs sorry guys. There really should be a - "sorry" emote. The pukey emote doesn't really translate that well in that scenario,lol.
---
Please don't call them cunts.
---
Cunts are useful.
---
Fuck, has it been that long already?
---
I don't think "most" agree with that.  Bloodied stealth commando is like the post popular meta build.  I agree but most people?  I doubt that.
---
And make them drop directly to our inventory like quest rewards (like with this year's Fasnacht) so we don't have to go diving in to the fissure it fell into to try to loot it.
---
Fucking yourself aggressively might be considered violent. 😂
---
It's worth it. Even if you run at full health.
---
I could care less what the other players do, as long as I have a full team, I'm happy. A full team provides the most amount of possible XP, no matter what they are doing.
---
I've seen them in Grahm's inventory, not sure where else they show up.
---
What do you want pepper and spices for? I Vendor them always
---
I do and still no one shows. I drop a nuke to do scorched earth and not a soul from an events team shows up. It just blows my mind
---
I think all dailies should reset at the same time. I shouldn't have to schedule my fun.
---
Haha yeah true. Sounds like there is a "sorry" emote coming soon, im just not sure when. It would be quite helpful
---
Isn't it covid fault and working separately because of that, or its just a nice excuse made by companies. Not only Beth but many others.
---
"sorry we couldn't deliver because virus"
---
That’s the thing with this. How long do u wait? Till one or two others get hits in? Till everyone gets to tag it? Or wait until I die or we fail the event cuz ppl aren’t paying attention? I def try not to one shot any legendary in an event but if it’s not practical to wait for everyone to tag it, it’s goin down , idc. I ve been burned too many times tryin to be nice. Then I’m the one who doesn’t get shit or dies and can’t respawn.
---
Maybe you understood me wrongly - it doesn't break stealth in the meaning you'll turn from Caution to Danger but it's loud and attract enemies to place you were shooting, which may results in unwanted fight and therefore it's better not to use explosive weapons extensively when playing stealth commando.
---
This! During Fasnacht, the legendary sloth at the end was always one shot killed. It got to the point where everyone was standing waiting where they thought it might appear. One time 2 paraders were killed, because the mob was ignored in favour of the sloth! You're simply not going to get the cast majority of people sharing. Some are just downright scared that if they don't shoot it, someone else will anyway. So while I always cripple legendaries with my shotgun, you're simply not going to get everyone doing the same.
---
In a juicehead video he shows a clip of the project lead saying seasons will be themed and the next is BOS themed.
---
I want a Responder vendor bot that can hold 4 vending machines worth of crap I sell.  I would put him behind the counter and let him do his thing.  I do get a kick out of the Raider bots though.  He would be fun.
---
Otherwise I would like just a bunch of random allies. They don't even need a function aside from giving me some sort of quest each day to get a weapon case.  I just get tired of seeing the same 4 or 5 people at everyone's camp.
---
Where’s my weasel ally bethesda?
---
So are assholes.
---
I think all the damage effects should be turned into bullet types, and you can use legendary modifications to allow it to transmute your bullets that are already there in your chamber into different types (explosive,bloody,anti-armor,50% mirelurk dmg, etc.) 
---
You can also keep increasing different bullets types you can switch to by adding more mods to the same slot so you have up to 4-5 equipped to switch between. To balance this ability maybe it costs a good portion of your AP each switch.
---
I think the only damage effects on weapons should play on game mechanics like two shot does for example. Also when you have these effects that are clearly better than the rest there is no room for creativity and it ends up becoming mandatory if you want to be the best. I think enchantments should help complete a build thats unique rather than just simply add damage.
---
An example would be that a revolver enhances the effect of mysterious stranger so he attacks 1 additional time or target, or have a % chance of getting ammo back on a critical strike. Certain effects would increase perk card effects or help complete a build, but not be just straight up damage. Those should be regulated to quality of mods, perk cards. Not every top tier weapon being bloody explosive. Damage effects overshadow every other effect, and they are not really interesting or fun. 
---
It's just overpowered and overshadows anything potentially interesting and makes adding new armor and weapon effects a bit more limited since no matter what you add it's not going to top the current meta unless it's on par with it or the current meta gets nerfed.
---
When you have things like sentinel armor(combined with nerdrage/chems) make you basically take 0 damage, that's just redicolous and it needs to change. As of right now you can stack too many damage effects while other potential effects get tossed to the wayside. 
---
This is not good design, you feel too obligated to go for the best effects. I think making all the damage types on weapons into bullet types that you can switch between on your weapon without having to carry extra bullets on you would be a easy solution to free up the current meta OMEGA-damage effects only and allow the developers to be more free to have more unique and interesting effects.
---
I'm just getting sick and tired of people showing up at the end and expect to get the legendary, especially when Im doing all the hard work, and repairing stuff. I don't have to share if your not going to help and just stand there like an idiot. Everyone needs to start pulling their weight in the Public servers. Or suck on my 2 shot guass shotgun.
---
That is very true but self harm on some random person is not something i would be responsible of :D
---
Nice XD got 30 modules saved up for the same thing but knowing my luck they will all be assassins or nocturnal
---
Curr, what a shame that is 😂
---
Always appear during queen fight.
---
Anti armour does not stack, stabilzed ignores 45% the aa will ignore 50% of the remaining 55%. So running an aa gun while already using stabilzed will get you about a 12% damage increase.
---
Also when they "fixed" aa on energy weapons they only kinda fixed it. The aa applys to the guns base damage. It does not calculate the boost from perk cards, effects, or anything else. So it loses out on a lot of damage potential.
---
Don't get me wrong the ult gat laser is one of my favourite guns. But an aa one is not great.
---
I am level 365 and the hope of new content with the updates keeps me going.  I also farm for script so I can get my SS armor build the way I want.  I carry two sets of armor, one Unyielding and one Troubleshooters.  I built 10 SS left legs last night and got one Troubleshooters I can use for the Imposter fight.  Until I get a piece to replace what I currently use there is no end to the grind.
---
I put my camp on the roof of my camper and it took 15 minutes to find it.  It fell thru the roof and under the pilings...
---
I put my camp on the roof of my red rocket station.  It fell into the roof and is embedded in the roof and wall.  You can see a sliver of it, to hit the repair option....
---
Ward was sitting backwards in his chair today, in the trailer.  His legs were thru the back of the seat and it was pretty comical.  He said something about being tired
---
If i dont reboot my xbox daily, it freaks out on day two, during stressful events.  The code seems a bit hard and heavy on Xbox uno.
---
Love the game.  Hate the idiotic coding and non-performance
---
Im a bounty hunter
---
Helping the wasteland
---
I sometimes use one on my second character, but I play on my heavy weapons guy the most out of all my characters. He's originally a pistol build, but can double as a rifle build, and triple as a bow build.
---
Same here with a quad auto tesla rifle, real pain in the ass!
---
Wait, what? Radiation Rumble I can understand but Scorched Earth? Why on earth(heh) would you miss that when you have a 4x event bonus?
---
Sometimes its ok to walk away mate, my ocd completionist self be damned!
---
This game doesn't have bugs. Its the way they obviously meant to be since none of these "bugs" ever get fixed.  😂
---
Power Armour isn't the meta though. Stabilised only works in Power Armour.
---
So what. It happens.
---
I am a bloodied heavy build with only very strong legacies and if I were to shoot it best case scenario it mutates. I always bash and then emote but sometimes I don’t get the chance.
---
I rented this game from a redbox when it came out and it was atrocious and I felt it deserved every criticism it got at the time. I got it off of game pass recently and it is a functional Bethesda game, which means it’s still riddled with bugs and more lazy fetch quests than I’d like but it works. 
---
I enjoy playing it but there’s no way in hell I’d ever pay for the game specifically or pay actual money for cosmetic items from the Atom shop. 
---
I know the company has to make money and their games have periods where they wax and wane in quality but I hope they revamp a lot of this stuff the next go around. 
---
At best, the fame feels like a dlc for fallout 4 with some new skins and multiplayer,  because that’s essentially what it is. 
---
There are things about Fallout 4 that I enjoyed but the settlement feature was not one of them. It’s such a buggy mess that I don’t quite understand why they’re hanging so much of the gameplay on it. I like fallout for the sardonic take on American values, the 50’s throwback aesthetic, and the rpg elements. 
---
The addition of NPC’s does a lot to make it feel as if the choices you make matter but the speech checks are superficial and don’t really seem to have any impact on the story as far as I can tell since they’re more of a pass/fail than branching dialogue thing in this game.
---
‘Let biggest criticism is of the C.A.M.P. System. ‘Rebuilding Appalachia’ by packing and unpacking buildings with wonky physics will the landscape around you permanently remains a bomber out hellscape regardless of what you do makes the stakes feel nonexistent.
---
If I wanted to play a modular building sim where there are absolutely no consequences to my actions i’d play, I dunno, . . . The Sims?
---
I wouldn't say NMS *fixed* everything, more like stuck a bandaid on it. Started playing a couple days ago and the jank is very visible, but I put the game down maybe twice, so either way NMS is fun to llay
---
I understand your frustration, this is why we need a chat box in this game. Many people try to say they don't have a mic or anything and they force you to try and talk to them through painful xbox chat. If you could just send messages to your whole team in game to organize the help in your team  i think that would solve a lot of people's problems since i think most people just get distracted, but if asked would come over and help you.
---
He being down voted because he's being an ass. Instead of civil replies with sound reasoning he's call people idiots and losers.
---
The second Plasma Caster I made was B2525
---
Hopping servers too.  Lots of people clear west tek and Harper’s then hop
---
The plan dropped for my alt last night - I believe it was in a SM Horde event in the Toxic Valley.
---
I bought 4 yesterday and crafted one. I normally craft them all and then check but for some reason I checked the first. Unyielding and radiation resistance. Not too bad.
---
The grind, the grind never changes...
---
Power armor is meta for heavy weapons users. If you don't use it you lose out on a 28% damage increase as well as a huge accuracy boost.
---
Pa heavy gunner. Bloodied stealth commando. Those are the metas
---
Just not true but you might be unlucky.  Try chatting on open mic, I made three new friends 2 nights ago on PS4.
---
You can't snap it to anything it's got a foundation.
---
Stack your XP bonuses, like Well Rested, Squirrel Stew, Scorchedbeast Brain, Leader Bobblehead, Inspirational, Building Team, Int Bonus gear.  Sometimes I’ll even switch into a Bloodied setup for fun and get another +30% XP from Unyielding Gear. 
---
WhiteSpring, WestTek, Harpers, Burrows. Don’t stop for loot, you’re on an XP grind. After that, server hop. 
---
It’s been a while since I did that, so maybe a little longer than an hour, but I’ve stopped worrying about hardcore grinding levels on my main and when I want to do this I switch over to my secondary. 
---
I think AngryTurtle did an XP build video that could help those that want to level faster. I think I missed a few things he recommended.
---
I'm with you on this one. Simply too many selfish people, because it's their game, not anyone else who happens to be playing.
---
Text chat would be nice tbh. 
---
Some people would abuse it for... well... fun-ny adult stuff I guess?
---
I've done that, eventually I got tired of sending support tickets.
---
You obviously don't use explosive weapons m8 :) You can shoot a target with explosive weapon and all his buddies will just wonder around like nothing happened (if they are not next to him and witness the hits). Only thing that causes enemies to notice something is happening and make your stealth go to "caution" is if they witness someone dying or getting shot at, which happens with any weapon. Explosive weapons do not make any sound if you are using suppressor. This is common knowledge :D
---
It's clearly a corporate culture problem that comes from the top.  If upper management cared they'd be firing people for rolling things out like this, but since it continues it suggests not only is testing not required, it's probably looked down upon as a waste of time and money and discouraged.
---
I've never worked at a place that would tolerate anything like what I see from Bethesda.  I'd fire any developer who rolled code or a feature that clearly wasn't even tested once, and I'd fire any project manager who didn't budget resources for formal testing of new features and products.
---
They’re a fan favorite. There’s no risk with them, they’ve been in the universe since 1 and everyone loves them. I’d rather have Beth stick to what they know they *can* write, weather than make another railroad or free states (idk what people think of free states, I personally think they were low effort and uninteresting, with a weak backstory and motivation, similar to the RR)
---
There is another version without the foundation.
---
This problem is more systematic. Credit for killing things should be shared by everyone..but maybe at the cost of less loot per creature and exp if you didn't kill.(provided your not afk)
---
So people can just play the game and not worry about such things.
---
As a current intern in software QA looking for a real job, I have looked at Bethesda and what I’ve noticed is they only have contract positions instead of full time QA and they pay like $10 an hour, so I don’t think QA is as big a deal to them as it is to us
---
Nice one mate, I’m currently a full health build but I’ve managed to roll some unyielding secret service armour.  Would I still get a benefit if I use it even though that’s mainly for bloodied builds?
---
Not bad at all! To be honest I was thinking of stopping at my 3 star chest, not too shabby with food and chem weight and rad resist, cant see the point in a tad bit more defense but massive grind when I have fairly decent bits now
---
Generally, the boredom of real life has kept me playing up to level 180 so far.
---
I wish there were more ways for people to become wanted
---
My understanding is one event spawns every 10 minutes, but that may have changed.
---
That will always happen. The point is to have convenience when organizing multiplayer. I would even take emotes that have specific messages, such as "Help with Event" or "gather together for X" That the party leader has access to to give out sorta "party commands" or w/e or setup party objectives that have rewards attached to them to direct people to where you want them to go.
---
Oh gosh I hope not. Did you play the outer worlds? No thank you.
---
Yeah, it's pretty good. About the same as many of the other heavies, but it's worth the grind if you mostly just want to collect. Definitely heavy on ammo usage just like all the other fast firing heavy weapons. The ammo is pretty heavy too, even after equipping the weight reduction perk. I carry maybe a max of 3k 2mm EC at any time, any more than that and I go scorchbeast hunting to burn the excess.
---
It's permanent
---
Good day MEMBER!
---
I am on XBox and have a 3\* Quad railway rifle I will give you.
---
Just on a related note... how OP do you need to be before one-shotting legendaries becomes a concern.
---
I say this because as a level 65 my main concerns when taking part in events had always been holding my own and not simply being a spare part and doing enough damage to the legendaries to get a potential reward. I'm not going for a 'build' just playing the game, I'm not bloodied or anything.
---
Recently though I've started to feel like I'm contributing more to events and getting a few more rewards, so I know I'm getting stronger.
---
Yesterday at Uranium Fever I was involved when a legendary came onto the scene, didn't think I'd killed it, didn't think I'd be anywhere near capable of one-shotting it, but straight after it died someone ran up to me and gave me the thumbs down emote. Seemed like they were suggesting I'd one-shotted it.
---
If it makes you feel any better, all I got from it was a one-star switchblade.
---
It's here to stay. Nothing to do with legendary run. Both were just released at the same time.
---
And i'm immediately downvoted. Gotta love this community.
---
Ran into them North of Point Pleasant, seems like a fairly regular spawn point for quality random encounters.
---
The Gauss minigun is the best fun ive ever had.  the sound of the beasty machine spinning up and never stopping for total distruction is incredible
---
Isn't Obsidian working on Aowed right now?
---
Ehhh, I love the game but they were a broken mess for along time. Basically went through two giant revamps. Literally every patch a dozen things break. Pvp performance is total garbage. Last expansion they had to take the servers down because they accidentally gave everyone the game.the exact same thing that happened with the expansion before that. 
---
I quit when they started becoming pay to win though. That store and loot crates is rough
---
Or, maybe, just maybe, coding and developing full stack is more complicated than how you imagine.
---
Just a thought 🙂
---
They should change the timer than, necause it still shows you have 30 minutes.
---
They're not useless, but as the others have said you've got better options for your build. You won't be out front enough, and assuming you aren't a bloodied build your focus would be better placed in getting the kill before enemies can retaliate, so focus more on stealth/dmg boosters, besides a few dmg blockers that should be on almost every build.
---
Fallout 76 made me install Fallout 4 again and go full-out horizon!
---
I’m always surprised to see posts like this, have you learned nothing in the short life span of fallout 76?
---
Power armor is bae  
---
That's it
---
Nothing worse than coming home from work, hoping on and your vendors have not reset yet.    Ive waited passed 8 pm (ET) and the vendors would not reset.  Sometimes I cant log in until late, and that punishes you if you try to play at a decent hour the next day.  
---
It would be much easier if everything reset at the same time every day.   I cant think of the downside, and why they dont want it like this.
---
Bows are fun for like sneaking around and hitting low levels. You probably don’t see them in boss fights because it’s not viable for the SBQ
---
The 10? small ones are not.  You can find a few in the Tyler county fairgrounds.   A bunch are at Camden park, rollercoaster image on the left side of the map.  It took 3 days, but I got all of the different normal sized ones from there.
---
Yeah 
---
Suddenly the BoS became anti-science in F4. It was really mind boggling as to why?  
---
All the tech, lost because maxon had a temper tantrum...
---
&gt;I was at an event and a level 60 twat was acting like an idiot so the gloves came off and I one shot everything out of spite.
---
That really doesn't make what you did ok. It just means there were two people at the event ruining it, not one.
---
The npcs in 76 are good for one thing : I get lots of stumpacks off 'em
---
I try to share always though some mobs probably will kill me and greedy low lvl assholes loot me bcz "ow wow 10 pieces of wood" but My point is: share legendaries with us as well. I personally drop all 1* sh!t for u to scrip. If u don't share legendaries we have all rights to do same thing. I already did and i liked it. And if u r a melee build doing líne in the sand or radiation rumble.. i understand everything but u won't kill a lot.
---
Yea, it really sucks with the energy weapons that use plasma and fusion cores. Quickly end up with lots of heavy cores with less than 5% ammo left in them. Instead of them being consumed, the just sit in your inventory weighing you down. Have to go through your inventory to dump them... gets old quick.
---
I agree with you.  I managed to get to the level I'm at through solo grinding and careful perk selection.  I had zero help from any other players.  No loot bags dropped at my feet filled with water, stimpacks, armour or legendary weapons.  I found them all or killed the creatures to get the weapons.  Now I have more legendaries than I can handle (queue rant on daily scrip caps!). So although I personally don't intentionally 1-shot legendaries during events, if there's a guy in the event that is, then so be it.  It took him ages to create that badass and why shouldn't he use it?  There are a shit-load of other opportunities to get gear out there without events.  And yes....it's 100% up to Bethesda to change the way loot is distributed at events, not for the players to create their own "code of ethics" so no one feels burned.
---
I don't understand how they manage to fuck things up like this...
---
It has more for sure. With that gane its almost like the game is finding the content so its kinda hard to tell unless you play a lot
---
Same here. Frustrating.
---
But its usually your 300+ plus user with a be handmade the one doing it... Don't you think those people don't give a damn at all no matter how many times you try to tell them off? I mean you do this i and block you for the session. Hopefully I won't find toxic users so often.
---
No, when you activate voice only
---
As long as your health is low (use Rads to keep it in place), then you’ll get the stat bonuses. I actually thrown on my set when I’m crafting new gear (along with the relevant perks if available) to make my gear’s base durability as high as possible.  I run a base of 6 Intelligence, but get another +7 from my mutations, at least +1 from Building Team, and then another +15 from the Unyielding gear. That’s 29 by itself, and I think crafted durability caps at 30, so I pop a Berry Mentats to push it over 30.  
---
Even without a Bloodied Weapon, though, you can still swap in related perks to make a viable Bloodied PVE temp-build, and go back to a full health build later if you prefer.
---
I traded with a guy from the trade subreddit that has two accounts and two xbones.
---
I agree completely. The last contact they had with Appalachia was a Taggerdy (who didn't sound in the least bit confident she could pull off the mission) before their big operation against the Scorched, which they knew was a potential second doomsday threat. Silence after that. Realistically you would \*have\* to investigate how things at the least ended. And it does sound like the mission was contested, too, so there is that.
---
I’ve never had this issue with either a .50 or a GMG, but it happens regularly with my handmade and occasionally even my fixer.
---
I got my sledgehammer plans from Grahm. There's also 1 mod for that weapon that will basically only drop from random events too. I scrapped hundreds and finally just looked up where that mod came from after not unlocking it.
---
I've never attempted this but I may be able to share some info that could help.  
---
Are you trying to place it directly onto roof panels?  If so see if it will place onto upper floor panels.  If your budget allows you could build a test platform out of upper floors and see if you can place it on there.  If it does you may need to convert that roof area to using upper floors some how. 
---
You could also try placing one on the ground and blueprint it and see if it lets you place the blueprint of it on the roof.
---
Question about herd mentality.   It says when your group is near or something.   I've heard if you're in a public group alone it works,  but if the are other people in your group do they have to be close to you,  or is it just misleading description and you only have to be in a group?
---
How much would you price the plan for the super sledge?
---
That’s brilliant thank you.
---
These look amazing! Some look like comic book cover art!
---
You just have to be in a group
---
Well if you have all the gear for your build leave the legendaries for the others. I stop going after them in uranium fever as it's always low level crap that I drop from the other players anyways.
---
There is a secondary timer that displays below the main timer once the event actually starts.
---
Also Charleston Capitol.
---
Didn't notice. Thanks.
---
I did used them but after I switched to non-explosive I have higher comfort of playing stealth commando, believe it or not. It's similar to difference between Grognak Axe and Super-Sledge - they've almost the same damage, yet rocket sound of SS makes more enemies attracted towards you.
---
Well that’s impossible since those are secondary and tertiary rolls. Can you post a picture? That would be a wild bug.
---
Campbuilding, completionism, and pvp.
---
No? I need legendaries to sell and also have other builds and characters. This again is not how you deal with things.
---
Stop telling people to play differently and focus on the actual problem. Not everyone wants to play the way that makes you happy and it's not their fault Bethesda designed this system to feel so bad.
---
It's a social sandbox game with some endgame content in the form of legendary gear grinding, achieved by a combination of daily quests, public events, and legendary enemy hunting for gear, Bullion, and Scrip. The season pass has been introduced to add a lateral progression path that primarily provides limited time cosmetics and utility items. On top of that, a lot of cosmetics are CAMP-based, so building new CAMPs every few weeks becomes an endgame of sorts, kind of like playing The Sims.
---
I don't think FO76 is in need of an "endgame" the way WoW and other games are, but it does need better support for player-to-player interactions whether that be through text chat, more player-initiated events (e.g. run your own caravan trading company), player clans + PvP, etc.
---
I think they mean that when you use voice chat your character mouth moves as well.
---
If that's true, how the hell does a studio their size not know about proper source and content management?
---
&gt; Workshops are bugged so you can't see who owns them.
---
ohhh, that would be why on more than a few occasions I traveled to what i thought was an unclaimed workshop only to find it be claimed.
---
Not just that. Surprised they don't sell something in the Atom shop that shows us in camp when each the the 40 differently timed dailys reset. /s
---
Haha, nope!
---
Once you hit 50 you stop getting points. Every level AFTER 50 you can either choose a new card, or you can swap a SPECIAL point.
---
That's why getting your build right early is paramount. If you have a load of points to swap around at 50+, you'll be having a baaaaad time.
---
So get prepping now before it's too late. 👍🏻
---
On the flip side, the people that use the "Follow" emote when they spy a legendary are the (Atom) bomb and we need more of those players!
---
And dickheads.
---
This should be higher. Not praising that you are clearly violating the tos but I am not your dad so...
---
Its all logistical imo. Tech debt/management are the biggest issues. Its fun to say they don't play the game even though they clearly do, but that is sexy and really gets the pan frying. 
---
The biggest thing that confounds me is the people that really work hard on providing technical info/bug reports/tickets etc have for about two years now been completely ignored or acknowledged in piss poor ways. Even when they invited Aten_Ra to HQ along with a few others for playtesting nw, nothing really changed (and the support staff encouraged social media/reddit posts to get the ball rolling on certain big issues they knew they couldnt mobilize internally) and now he doesn't play the game anymore which to me indicates they took the olive branch purposefully or not and collectively shoved it where the sun don't shine. I mean you figure in the best of circumstances re-working high level positions/organizations while supporting a live game as big as 76 is an incredible undertaking, but something should be happening by now and the continual day 1 issues look really bad and I think that is reflected in the player numbers we have access to. We are down to 8-11k most weekends and as low as 6.5k that I have seen playing daily on weekdays/nights on pc. Eventually the scales will flatten once enough of the whales leave and that will be that and 76 had a nice run and in a few years if it does die we will see "What happened to fallout76" videos/articles on major gaming websites.
---
It has been a deal breaker for a lot of people.  Bethesda has basically shrunk their market for this game down to players with a high tolerance for this sort of shit.
---
Yea Super Sledge does break stealth very easily with the rocket sound thingy. Even if you just swing it around without actually hitting anyone or anything.
---
True, that’s not bad to add in.
---
Same here, but I've noticed it's with the handmade, ultracite, plasma gatling, and I think a few others like the railway rifle if its automatic. If you bash it cancels the reload but then it will say you have 60 rounds but will run out within say like 5 shots and other times the counter will reset to a full magazine on its own.
---
Yes! Finally someone understands and isn’t just saying “well don’t play bloodied or low health” I mean yeah I could totally not play that way and I basically am, I go low health but that’s about it just for the uny effects, but it’s hard to not play that way when the game realllly wants you to play that way. You think oh I’ll try try a different build with high health and no gimmicks, but then youre just a peashooting clown while everybody runs around one shotting with pipe pistols. It sucks that if you want to be better than sub par you have to go low health, stealth vats, bloodied any of those things and that’s it. Formula for destruction. And yeah there’s junkies and berserkers but berserker sucks if you’re not gonna use sneak but if you use sneak then you do overpowered dmg, junkies isn’t bad but it’s still just a little too much dmg for anything in this game. And it’s stupid that I have to be addicted for those effects to even work but hey at least it’s a unique build that requires some sacrifice. People say low health is the bloodied sacrifice hahahaha low health literally becomes more tanky than full health with the right perks so there really is no sacrifice for bloodied low health is just straight destruction with no consequences.
---
Seconded. They lost my trust with how they handled, well everything, with the launch of 76. Shameless cash grab with shitty products. Whenever FO5 drops, I will only be buying it second hand. And as a huge Fallout fan, that upsets me
---
Yeah, I'm sure there are QA folks sitting there filing bugs like "Priority 1, Feature doesn't work enough to even test" and seeing it still pushed live and being like "WTF am I doing with my life?"
---
Sometimes it's just an accident too. I have a difficult time in radiation rumble especially when I am carrying in terms of scavanger defence but what happens if you have a bloodied build with a B/25 fixer and gun fu is that you end up firing multiple shots on a single button press and may one shot stuff before you can react or see its a legendary.
---
Its different when the legendary is clear or expected but I find it hard within hordes.
---
Have you played Tactics? The Brotherhood use airships to get to Chicago and is canon.
---
I run a rockem sockem robots build. I use emergency protocols, hydrologic bracers and kinetic servos.
---

---
2020 has been 1100 months long.
---
So rather than be friendly and let everyone have a good time. You want to blame the system none of us can change, rather than try and help your fellow man have good time. 
---
Now it sound likes your not at the end of collecting the best build or having so many caps on all 5 characters they are useless, so I understand you needed them. But choosing to be selfish and blaming it on some unchangeable external source, rather than you own choice, well that's on you.
---
At this point, it's pretty clear it's running the way management wants.  They've had plenty of time to change how they operate, and they don't.
---
I hope Todd dies in his sleep tonight.
---
This happens to me with my Teslas. I'll go through the initial 15 rounds, it'll be empty/stop firing but say 11 rounds are still in there. Seems like if I melee after that, I can shoot the additional 11 rounds without having to reload. Seems like it happens with other weapons too but is most noticeable with the Tesla because I have to reload like every 2 seconds during Uranium Fever (this is usually the only time I use Teslas anymore).
---
So you didn't read the post where I said I play solo or bring a Tesla. Good job.
---
Edit to add: the point is this feels bad and it can be changed with enough player outrage. But look how long it's taken because as long as the blame is on players Bethesda is going to take their time.
---
Thank you! So I’ll focus on maxing my intended SPECIAL perks first, and not really worry about the actual cards if they’re trash in the beginning? Because boy are they trash...
---
45 degree or round defensive wall/catwalk
---
I need the pass through the wall electric connector to work with the military tent.
---
Ah, sorry about the typo. I meant 3 star with those stats  
---
It also has Mutant Slayer
---
Those turnarounds happened because the studios took pride in their projects.  There doesn't seem to be any pride here.
---
it's still 2020?!? damn synths
---
Fast travel or run back to your camp, they will m meet u there. Should be a note and some items in the box too. Check my mannequins post on my profile
---
True, “everything” is a bit of an exaggeration. I played it again recently too and there was quite a lot of issues. Still, that’s kinda gonna be an issue with all procedurally generated open world games.
---
👍🏻
---
they should just unlock all the atom shop items in the pts so they can get feed back before release
---
I accidentally one shotted a legendary at uranium fever, I’ve got an explosive gat laser that one shots enemies even when I don’t intend to do so
---
It’s most popular because of the damage obviously and sneaking is just plain fun but I think a lot of people go bloodied stealth, realize it’s ridiculously over powered then try to go back to a “normal” way of playing and they literally can’t. At least that’s how it is for me, I take off my low health and stop sneaking and suddenly I feel like I just walked out of vault 76 again hardly able to take down a mob of ghouls. It’s like playing grand theft auto with cheat codes and then trying to play without them. I’m exaggerating a bit, obviously I can through the game just fine without all that low health stuff but it’s just different after you’ve gone bloodied. Definitely a mental thing and maybe it’s just me but who knows.
---
Off*
---
Thanks,  time to hunt me down a syrem 😁
---
Maybe if we had like a console that we could put in our camp. It could track our vendor/scrip/gold caps/resets, daily events and all that. Then I could stop traveling to crater/foundation to see if I can accept the daily missions yet.
---
Welcome to the world of F/O76 disappointment.  Be ready for a hundred more as you grind script for the piece you actually want.
---
They have done this for the backpacks recently where you now craft skins for it rather than a new backpack for each new 'skin' back then. but ofc it would be too much expected from Bethesda to look ahead and fix similar issues at the same time.
---
Because all of them are wearing chinese stealth suits and invisible. (Kind of a joke) Me and my brother roll stealth suit and bow. My carry weight is down to 40 with no Loot. So I’m loving it. Bows rock as well.
---
I did but we aren't talking about playing solo at all in this thread. But please keep doing it that. And take Moment to realize why you play solo with no friends.
---
I'm 221- I wouldn't worry too much about leveling - happens when it happens.  The daily/weekly score challenges are where I spend most of my time.  Those will generally get me a level every 2-1/2-3 play session (of about an hour each - without XP boosting foods and such). Being on a build team helps.
---
It'd be funny tho you gotta admit that. Like a scene right out of skyrim. All the arrows shooting at the dragon er scorch beast.
---
Sounds like something out of dead rising 4
---
Because the system is broken and to actually enjoy the power fantasy in this game you can't play with others. That is 100% why
---
The Enclave is coming, they just had a late start because MODUS just contacted them an ingame year ago and the BoS was already mobilizing to the East at the time.
---
Agreed on the minimilism. I like relocating frequently, so I've revised my design down to two self contained buildings that each have a 1x2 foot print. One is a "tiny house" that has a bed, stash/scrap box, small cooking stove, and chem bench. The other building is a 1x2 garage with stash/scrap boxes, 2 vending machines, and 6 of the silent VT generators. I used the poster glitch to put one power connector on the outside of the building so I can plug in extractor if I am camped near a resource, and I just need to flip a switch to shut off the machines and shut the garage door when I want to keep people  from buying stuff.
---
Since there's no complex wiring and they have such tiny footprints I can plop them down almost anywhere, and I move almost daily. If I end up on a server with lots of low level players I'll move oveer to the forest, or if I'm on one where people are dropping nukes I'll relocate to just outside the blast zone and make some sales from people killing the queen.
---
It’s a misleading description but a few others have misleading descriptions as well (plague walker comes to mind) so it may be an abandoned change or something upcoming.  No official word however, works no matter what your distance.
---
I try and level up each night I play for a couple of hours. Some nights it easy as there’s loads of nukes being dropped. Other times is quiet. Also noticed that the last week or so, there’s been a massive drop in events on XB.
---
I think that the edge detection/collision in this game make it hard to give the AI meaningful perceptive abilities. Without this it seems that all of the strategies for making combat more difficult result in a boring damage sponge paradigm, or one that doesn't reflect reality enough to be understood naturally within the game's context.
---
"Its just cosmetic" isn't a valid hand-wave of shitty monetisation practices
---
This only happens to me when I'm doing a queen fight. That usually the only time I'm wearing the stealth suit as well.
---
My weapon isn't ultracite.
---
I have a bloodied 50crit/lvc bow and it hits for 1200-1500. 
---
Personally I doubt you’re gonna see it at the SBQ, Encryptid, or Colossus events, but anything else it would work fine. I use it to clear my xp / legendary routes when I’m tired of the normal rifles/melee. 
---
Pretty much useless in current pvp situations as well, but I can say that if they ever brought survival back I would definitely try it out.
---
"the first being that the singular reason why the legendary run is the way it is, is so that you spend 150 bucks instead of being inconvenienced daily for months. that's the very definition of manipulation: create a problem and then sell the solution."
---
May be the dumbest thing I've ever read. Not providing the option to buy out wouldn't be good business, as there's always atlesst some players willing to drop big money for this kind of stuff....
---
But the idea that they are expecting a significant portion of the player base to spend 150 bucks is just beyond absurd. 
---
Drop a few bucks to skip a few levels? Sure. 
---
Also they never created a problem. A problem can't be avoided and needs a solution.... With this season? You could simply display an ounce of will power, bypass your crippling fomo and only participate if and when you want to.... And suddenly the problem that they "created" that you need to pay for as a "solution" suddenly doesn't exist....
---
&gt;Also it made literally no sense for them to blow up the institute.
---
Have you seen a movie called Terminator?
---
Yup. Robo-vendors, scrip machines, and the gold bullion machines reset 20 hours after you first make a transaction.
---
I am a huge eso fan/player since day 1 and even I pretty much agree with what you're saying, up until you said it's pay to win. Unless you consider gear being locked behind expansions or dlcs (that's still not actually pay to win, every mmo ever has been like this long before micro transactions were even a thing) there is absolutely nothing in eso that's pay to win.
---
have my upvote sir!
---
Pretend I’m screaming like a semi high pitch Wendigo “AUAGAUGh”
---
You sound like that orange guy I keep having to listen to in the news. Have fun with that.
---
At the end of Fallout 4 story and DLCs, you are left with an open sandbox. Now fill that sandbox with repeatable challenges and events that have pretty much been there since the start, and tightly metered pursuits of currencies and faction rep, and you have the current state of 76. You can see where longer term players are hungry for new meatier content. If I could guess root cause, they are treating their live service game with a traditional single story RPG development cycle. Building large content drops that take a lot of time to develop but can be consumed quickly. They should probably add a developer team focused just on feathering in smaller story quests, new ally stories, etc. throughout the year to keep the game world vibrant in between the large expansions.
---
I’m expecting/wanting the game to be more how it’s been in the past. It doesn’t need to be a military simulator but could it hurt them to use some common sense? I’ve never played arma or insurgency I’ll have to check those out if they’re good. But I love fallout, I love it for what it is I just have some issues with the weapon balancing since that’s what the whole game is, getting cool weapons and blasting enemies. But why if I want to deal a lot of damage the only way to do so by going low health, bloodied or using sneak with commando? Why is that my only real option to attain big damage numbers? And not just big numbers because I know you can get high numbers with shottys and snipers but huge stupid queen melting game breaking numbers just from stealth and low health? It just seems dumb.
---
My guess for 'why' casual is every Atomshop UA? it's easy and lazy to implement. Copy&amp;Caste the same code each time but change its textures, done! New Atomicshop camo! and as nobody doublechecks (or checks at all) the stuff they're putting through we now have the issues with stuff from the Atomicshop where nobody knows what went wrong where as they all happily copy+pasted code without checking it firsthand until it inevitably broke.
---
Thats what i mean, people have been saying its from playing NW last, or going into the Atomic Shop before the game, or staying logged in while they reset.
---
No one knows what's causing it.
---
to be fair it was SUPPOUSED to come out last fall/winter. OP may have forgotten the 6 month delay.
---
I'm on PC unfortunately but thanks for offering.
---
here is a simple solution...nuke their bases. Often times people leave if you nuke their camps. If they don't, still satisfying. Can't make any money till they go back and build it.
---
I can't wait until a Fallout game is set 10 million years in the future and Bethesda's like "So the BOS and the Supermutants all got put Into suspended animation together and..."
---
Forty. Thousand. Steel.
---
Gun bash or pipe pistol every time. Don’t be an ass. Don’t be Johnny One-Shot.
---
Neon letter plans
---
Is there a sheepsquatch plushie besides the one on the SCORE board? 🥺😦 ahhh I missed it too
---
This. While likely an unpopular opinion, I'm happy with this change. The event is fun, much more so the first time you do it and don't know what's coming. Getting screamed at on area chat to "STOP PLAYING THE F\*&amp;!ING INSTRUMENTS" while we sit and wait for a slow spawn of ghouls was old at best.
---
back in Fo4 or skyrim, those skins would be rewards from a quest. in Fo76, they're awarded to you after months of making you login daily and inconveniencing your playtime. that's a problem, by definition. and was artificially coined by Bethesda themselves. why? so people would buy atoms. doesn't matter if they spend the full amount, the legendary run was designed specifically to be profitable and nothing else.
---
and if you think there's nothing shady about that then this conversation is pointless because you're clearly way too naive to be using the internet.
---
It's honestly too late for this plea. The community has moved in this direction in the worst way and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. This behavior used to be the exception but it's now the norm.
---
There was definitely no sleeping involved in that Cracker Barrel restroom
---
This is true.
---
Most of the folks I see doing it are between 70-150 level. But I'm with you on the block part.
---
We are! Their still dying in 1 shot!
---
Im not having a problem with dying on the junkies build Ive got 500/500 DRs out of power armour and 450 health, using solar armor I never even really see my health bar drop beyond 99% full. Its that beyond trash mobs the damage is nowhere even near what I can get on my non stealth bloodied build.
---
Use a Tesla rifle if your that bad at tagging legendaries.
---
o like arma 3 does, got it, it would be nice
---
If you were worried about a company profiting from a game....especially an online service.... In this era of gaming? 
---
Go torch your phone, pc and console. Cause this is the way it is now. 
---
Calls me naive.... 
---
And if you think you people bitching and whining about OPTIONAL purchases is going to affect change? You need to give your head a shake.
---
I learned that apparently my powerfist can one shot the night stalker the hard way :(
---
Being in a Public Team by yourself will trigger Herd Mentality's affect as well.
---
I'm more talking about the buying of skill points and skill lines. And its one thing to sell progression but 30 dollars a skill line? Thats absurd.
---
I find that - on teams I’ve been on - that we all do different events and rarely end up at the same ones. I personally like to do the little events and bang them out quick.
---
Ain't no time to be wastin time with kid gloves in radiation rumble.
---
No rules just what you want people to do
---
........well guess what
---
That Monopoly guy with a big money bag, obviously changed to the fallout boy.
---
Thank u
---
Have you done the main quest for the overseer? Have you done both faction quests?
---
https://youtu.be/E7Sr-cpFwUc
---
Swear this isn’t a rick roll
---
I’m a level 380 and an assaultron one shots me, I’d say you may need to start looking and specific builds start grinding out legendary gear, or perhaps find a few people to join you, if you’re on Xbox I can always help you out
---
&gt; Does anyone have some advice?
---
you likely need better gear.. also it would help to see your build in order to better direct advice...
---
throw your build into [nukes&amp;dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) so we can take a look at what youre working with
---
Holy shit, hadn’t even noticed that ballistic fiber isn’t needed for repairs. I’ve had a full suit of SS for a couple weeks now it seems. TY
---
none of them is particularly good I'm afraid. they're all essentially 1\*.
---
the LMG in particular is bugged and that's why you're seeing such massive damage. I don't think they're fixing it in the upcoming patch, so you're good. at least for a while longer.
---
Thank you so much. Any stim donations would be gratefully accepted! Are you on PC?
---
Yeah, Totally agree. I'm at 170+the only challenging things now are SBQ and Wendigo Colossus.  But really they are just bullet sponges and strategy consists of - just keep shootin! Would love to see some enemies that require real teamwork like Imposter sheepsquatch - thats kinda fun.
---
This is hilarious...have had the same experience. My main dude never got any lovin. I created an alt, a cute little female assassin, and she has been gifted tons of stuff and has never been harassed by a griefer.  It's been more fun to run the alt through the Legendary Run.  The only problem, my female assassin (who runs around in an asylum nurse outfit. Is quick with a stimpak, and eats corpses), keeps getting abandoned on teams.  Maybe it's her obscure pop culture screen name, maybe people don't like cannibal nurses....
---
Cleveland? Chili's? Was there a Steamer involved?
---
To add to your response, if your playing private, who are selling legendaries too? Vendor Bots?
---
Yes, you're right.  I should have clarified.  You can't roll a "Bloodied Explosive Gauss Minigun."  But if you turn on damage numbers, you can see the little explosive ones.  They're are the same gun in all but name.
---
That. In the upper levels you really start getting punished for not having a build and decent gear. It gets hard to just walk around and kill everything
---
- Monster mash
---
- awol armaments
---
- radiation rumble
---
- riding shotgun
---
You're right it's impossible to swap between private and public servers when I need to sell or buy things.
---
So now you need everyone else to get your caps, now the community is good for you. Good luck.
---
Ahh!! Wow. That would be awesome. My user is RyGuy062
---
I’ve been working on the overseer quest. I got to the settler base, and need to go to crater still. The quest for the settlers sends me to cranberry bog though.
---
funnel cake
---
They are too good. I was playing a new character. I make one to do the level up challenge quickly. I always delete  the character afterwards. A level 60 tried to give me some goodies. I gave him the heart emote the no remote to say thank you but no. I couldn't let him waste his stuff on a toon I was deleting.
---
For a bloodied build dense is good to not die from explosions:)
---
just because it's common practice doesn't make it any less shady. the EU as a whole is looking into banning loot boxes, for example. despite how common they are. some countries already did ban them, in fact.
---
it also doesn't mean I'm not gonna complain about one of my favorite series going the way of mobile games with all this monetization bs. there's a difference between profit and predatory business practices. Fo4 was profitable. skyrim was profitable. this is just bs.
---
and I know it's not gonna change anything. but it's my god-given right. not to mention even the op shares this sentiment: "I **wish** Bethesda read these comments"
---
Really depends on the when and where. Noone is checking every ghoul they point their gun at before they pull the trigger.
---
But you can't buy them until you earn them regularly on one character. Same with the skyshards. That's more "pay-to-make-it-account-wide". If you could buy the game, create a character, and immediately buy skill trees or skyshards I'd definitely call it pay to win then.
---
My character is a female too level 100(3rd time playing so this character is built nice) and I had this level 18 come to my vendor. Which is usually empty i just have it up for the challenges now. This level 18 tells me to put more stuff in my vendor and shit is too expensive. I start talking and I sound like either a 12 boy or 8 year girl on mic. So yea The complaining stops And he starts dropping me a mini nuke some ammo and a regular combat shotgun. And then invites me to an event. Im just like wtf dude?
---
Wait what? When did I ever say it was bad? Stop trying to start fights and actually comprehend what you're reading. Blaming Bethesda for taking this long to fix a broken system does not mean I said I don't need the community. Playing solo is simply my solution to using my full build in events. Get your head out of your ass.
---
Amen!
---
I’m guessing this realistically won’t work because of how many settings on their end/server side that a modder wouldn’t have access to.
---
Exactly my thinking. Where are the Free States??? Raleigh Clay was never said to have died and not everyone was killed in Harper's Ferry. 
---
There really is no excuse to not bringing them back in the future. The assets are there and the mission potential could be very interesting. Raleigh Clay could return with a small group of Free Staters who look to settle somewhere. They could also integrate themselves into the settlers or vice-versa. 
---
But Bethesda has always had a BOS hard-on. We get it, they're badass power armor users made up of military remnants. They're all-powerful, use latin mottos, each member is a very stern "For the Brotherhood!" Soldier. Honestly, it's boring after seeing that in 3 and 4.
---
 I definitely preferred working for the Enclave rather than BOS for once. I'm afraid MODUS is the closest we will get to having Enclave events and content. BOS will take over Appalachia, I'm calling it.
---
Yeah I was thinking my perks may be an issue. I put some points into strength for heavy weapons after getting a nice Gatling plasma. I was going stealth sniper before that which worked really well. Now it seems like nothing is strong enough to kill.
---
There is no holster. Your weapons disappear into and out of the void.
---
I’ll keep my eye out for an junkies laser. I have a prime plasma that has has the same requirement for ammo. 
---
I didn’t know power user helps out on the amount of ammo used. I’ll have to use it for my plasma as well. 
---
I have a 1/* junkies gat that I just pulled from the purveyor yesterday that I was thinking about trying.  I just need to figure out what to get addicted to. :)
---
You are on pc? If you are on PS4 I can give you one?
---
A bunch of bunker nuts who are so scared shitless that they can’t even go grocery shopping is better?
---
One of my favorite tricks. I always drop a random piece of junk or ammo to let them know they had a visitor.
---
the PA 'bow' you are talking about would be a 'ballista', which would be cool though firing a giant bolt at the SBQ and nailing her to the nearest tree.
---
These are truly great shots!  Much appreciated!
---
One, you can't compare moral dilemmas from a post apocalyptic wasteland and the real world in the same context.... Nor in a game and real life. 
---
One. An ability to buy out your wanted status in game immediately makes the risk of PvP disappear. 
---
Two. The wasteland polices itself. There's no reform system. There's no rehabilitation. Those ideas and system died.
---
Three. You assume that you deserve to be murdered. Not that there's plenty of people with few morals not willing to just murder a common criminal to benefit themselves.
---
Yeah I've been seeing more and more legacy weapons being used nowadays along with the gauss shotgun. uranium fever has just not been viable for legendaries.
---
I do this and emote beckon.  But I ain’t a damage sponge, so come quick or I will kill it and move on
---
Does seem alot slower indeed. Its horrible some times il be on a server for 3 hours and no events pop up, since Monday I've got had radiation rumble come up 2 times (I've been playing 8 hours a day) I really want the radiation barrel plan but once it does appear no one collects the ore -. -
---
Money
---
Alcohol, daddy o, day tripper, fury, ments. That's what I'm addicted to
---
i try to but if they are to slow i will not wait, i mostly play this like a single player game with people who just randomly pop up. i like speed
---
I had never experienced this bug, but I have the exact same challenges auto completed this week as OP.
---
the game sometimes spawns me inside their locked rooms so I'd wager locks are pretty useless anyway.
---
What build are you running? Make contact with the raiders at crater and start that get threw the main quests and that should help you level to 50 as well as give you some nice plans like stealth armor. Just remember to run both faction quests up to the end before making your choice.
---
also.. it takes getting melted a few ties to learn to shoot ASSaultrons and leveled gutsys in the leg.. lol
---
I'll be on in like an hour or so! My ps is MoirasBioticPee!
---
It takes 2mm like the gauss riffle correct?  Also that ammo is heavy from what I remember.  Does batteries included make it lighter?
---
I've gotten into a routine, log in after the score challenges reset and do all of them, then wait until dailies reset and do all of them, then occasionally farm for some components or whatever, maybe go look for a rare item for a while somewhere to collect more plans.
---
I got on that train too buddy, one way ticket to disappointment.
---
Sorry if there was a miscommunication.  It does work for NW. It is usable. You just cant apply mods to it like you can the already in game SS underarmor. I would like to apply shielded so I can wear my ss ghillie with the camo under so it looks 1000 times better. If that makes sense.
---
I saw someone yesterday kill the scorchbwast queen in four seconds, before anyone else in the area could even get a shot in. Technically Bethesda's fault for allowing a character to become that strong, in reality that player is a bit of an ass because they clearly know what they're doing.
---
Yes the system itself could be better but Bethesda isn't responsible for people's poor manners in situations like this.
---
Yeah. Sad that this was changed. Used to be one of my favorite missions
---
That’s a pattern - paradise and rumble and the guided cow thingy😂
---
Thank you very much! You're welcome.
---
I’m coming up on day 30 of crafting three secret service pieces a day without unyielding, this games grind is ridiculous
---
I had a combat shotty with bash damage, but it got buggy sometimes. Some bash would take half their health. Sometimes barely any health was gone so I abandoned it.
---
:(
---
There’s definitely a good deal they don’t currently have access to, but the scope of fixable things in its current state is actually quite large.
---
Ok I’ll work on the PA first and when I get my rep maxed with the raiders I’ll pick one up.
---
I picked someones front door yeaterday just to see what their house looked like. It was really nice and he FT'd over and found me sitting there idling and playing his steel guitar. This game is a fucking trip sometimes.
---
If you run with a group and stick close to them you dont have to worry about tagging mobs for legendaries. Just find people actively running all of the events and keep close.
---
Running radiation rumble yesterday, my friends game crashed and he still managed to loot several legendaries from my kills that he never tagged.
---
You could try shifting some of the DR into other perks perhaps on that junkie build. I know after 450 dmg reduc is almost non-existent because of the way the game is designed, and even then you can often achieve the same defense with a single % reduc Carr vs a a bunch of straight DR cards. Could help amping up your junkies. Obv not going to come near the dmg of a bloody tho
---
They can't. It's so obvious.
---
&gt; Assulttron one shots me, 4 times. At this point I can’t even figure out what I did wrong
---
as soon as you see an ASSaultron.. ignore everything else and shot it in the legs ASAP until its down.. then pick it off...
---
a piece of troubleshooters armor or two helps if you can find it cheap...
---
I carry a troubleshooters weapon on my toons just because of ASSaultrons and leveled gutsys...
---
Yup it’s gone. It’s just junk.
---
I enjoy it a lot. Just don't prime it right away. Since the flux can be hard to get. I have primed and unprimed ones. Tri barrel is great.
---
You might wish to try using a LFG discord channel. It's a lot more effective in getting people to the popular events.
---
That's what happens when you fall into a fissure.
---
No, is a sandman rickroll
---
This is why I mostly never use my mic. I did once and now I have 2 new friends twice my level giving lots of stuff, which is very nice, but I don't need it xD I'm lvl 150 but it doesn't matter if some people hear a female voice I guess 😂
---
Now this sound like a great reason to get it!  Make the grind worth it.  Having trouble finding enough time to get daily’s and rep points done every day much less events for treasury notes.  It does help when the daily is complete 3 events. :)
---
Join a public team and run with them for a bit. Nothing wrong with a little back up.
---
I just keep shooting them in the back of the head until they move, way more fun, It's not like it's a serious fight anyway....
---
those people dont browse this subreddit so your PSA will go unnoticed
---
You knew exactly you what you were doing by making that female character.
---
It’s not a bug, the pit is instakill.
---
Exactly, ask for refund EVERY time an item is broken. Is the only way they would care because "loss" (not really, you know, once you bought atoms, you bough atoms, they don't care if they have to give you few more from time to time due to bugs).
---
No problem!
---
It’s black for the Secret Service.
---
SIMP
---
There's also a glitch you can use to get threw any locked door. I use it all the time since I love checking out people's camps haha. Don't know why people bother locking them
---
Even the suspended players got basically no punishment. Should have at least rolled their accounts back 2 weeks as people sell these for real money.
---
 A friend of mine still can't log in though and he was just duping a few guns for friends.
---
I agree with you on this. For something like this I would just play solo but I mean come on how else can they test it if they don't pay for fo1st? I don't think I've ever played a game before where "stop using your build it's too good" was an actual complaint. Again what's the point in even making a build if you can't use it because it ruins everyone else's experience if you're too strong.
---
However melting the sbq that fast was likely magic weapons which I don't even know what to think about that whole situation. The whole thing is kinda fucked the more you think about it.
---
A new member to the club
---
You'd be welcome on my team! I love weird characters.
---
Going to have to put pharma pharma on and do a WS loop to collect some chems. 
---
I know I have the recipes not sure I have the material to craft them.
---
Its not that they dont care - it's that they dont care to hire talented developers.
---
I tend to consume games like a locust. I tear through them, master the systems, and go onto the next. For some reason, 76 just clicks and I feel like I can play it forever. 
---
Yes, its buggy as shit, things break, most of the skins and fancy items in the shop are actively detrimental. Yes, the cap limit exists to force you to engage in actually substantively build up your vendor stuff. Yes, the drop rates are messy and encourage checking other peoples shops and talking to people. 
---
I just have a basic utility platform camp and do none of that. The game is just really, really soothing to my autistic hoarder traits. I pay for 1st so I'm absolutely picking up EVERYTHING and dropping it all in the supply box - stopped seeking anything but adhesive, screws, and plastic since then. I hit the caps limit every day and still zero out.
---
I imagine once I've unlocked everything on my shotgun / pistols character I'll keep tuning it up, and go back to my original sniper character, and I'll do a power armor character at some point because I just haven't touched those systems at all yet. 
---
Its limited, but in a way that makes you change up your playstyle if you want to git gud. I've ALWAYS played the "stealth archer" in these games.  Wouldnt you know, that means I need to rework all my assumptions to do a close range stealth less type? All my armor choices have to change, etc, 
---
It's nice to have a rut and then work your way out of it. That and a very,  very satisfying core loop keep me coming back.
---
Jokes on them, I only played for 3 weeks. It’s not as bad as I thought it was before playing. But it’s still pretty bad
---
What do loot boxes have to do with any of this?  They were banned because they are essentially a form of gambling, and were never in 76
---
76 opted for MTXs and Free DLC. Games are not free to maintain. Online services less so. 
---
How were you expecting them to continue keeping the game online? Wishful thinking? Hopes and dreams? The memory of single player Fallout games? 
---
If you don't like optional purchases and have zero will power like the droves of consumer whores suffering from crippling fomo? Maybe stop gaming.
---
Doesnt even have to be a pipe gun. 
---
I use an auto 38 fixer for my commando build (non stealth) and I can tag enemies easy, and still do plenty of damage at most events.
---
And best of all, get to use up my .38 ammo
---
How do people deal with limitations in life? We make choices. 
---
Some whip out a credit card for 1st’s stash box. Some create mule characters to collect more. Some play a tiny bit each day and stop when they hit the limit lines. Some give stuff away freely to other players. Some tightly manage their stash to just what is needed day to day. Some do a mix of things to keep under the limit lines. Some don’t even care about the limits. Some just start a new play through to experience the story again or try new builds. 
---
The key is finding out what makes the game fun for you, and lean into whatever that looks like.
---
Also, some people even one shot waves. Dude, there's like 15 more people in the event. Just put some perks away, you will tag them all with those -I'm not gonna say duped (shit, I did)- weapons.
---
I block those players in hope to never find them again.
---
Not much really. Depends on what gaming style you prefer. Want all the stuff unlocked? Gold grind and legendary modules. Want to finish the legendary run? Do dailies and public teams/events for XP. Want to build? Buy up all the plans you can at vendors and build away! Etc. 
---
I'm a trophy/achievement chaser. So I was done a long while ago. Now it's just the run that keeps me around.
---
I don’t deserve to be murdered.
---
I *need* to be murdered in order to participate in the video game on a mechanical level.
---
There is no moral option about it. It’s the ONLY path.
---
I  will always drop stuff for anyone under level 25 pretty much. Mostly plans though.  
---
I do sometimes wonder if they're rich alts or such, but meh, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.
---
Actually, no I didn't.  I created the character simply as a mule with no intention of playing it, it was just to alleviate the constant problems I had with weight issues.  As it turns out I forgot about all the quests and redsicovered it's more fun to do them than the grind which is the end game.
---
I purposely sell everything I put up for 99caps or lower.  I like giving people deals.  You don't know why this player (or any player) listed it at 200 - could have been very intentional.
---
Hi... Are they still partnered with twitch prime to release loot? I checked the page and there isn't anything available right now but I'm wondering if it's worth checking back every few weeks
---
It’s functionally a NW skin.
---
What they need is a new engine. let old Frankenstein retire
---
Meaning?
---
Certain parts, yes. As with every MMORPG you are going to be captivated and excited during the questlines. 
---
End game content/gear grinds seem to be on par with other online games, but the questlines expansions are not coming fast enough to break up the grind. Most if the early players did this without a questlines so DISCOVERING became the game. This was lacking in the questlines a Bethesda made sure to PROC quest when you enter an area taking the fallout discovery process lacking thus giving no incentive to explore and you are just tied to the end goal of leveling/prime plan farming of the SBQ and now gold grimf for the SS armor RNG slot machine.
---
Can we PLEASE have dailies reset like vendors do. I mean, the 20h reset adapts to the player's life, just put everything together. Personal timers. And something, somewhere, to check the timers/resets in the Pip-Boy.
---
Not really worth way more since all the mules maxed out with duped god rolls were unbanned.
---
I was running a bloodied sniper build, pretty much one shot for 90 % if the time pretty much you can be high damage resist low damage or the opposite, or you can go junkies and have a decent build
---
Why are you getting downvoted?? Everything you said is correct.
---
Because you can’t mod it, the only reason anyone would use it would be for Nuclear Winter.
---
It sucks, really.
---
I have a large stash of flux.  Been playing since the launch (no beta). Although I keep getting low on stable yellow cake since that is what I use for my plasma right now. If I try real hard I can get 20 yellow from a queen nuke.  Just always hunting high rad fluid.   Usually stock up on yellow with a WS nuke but with the daily’s and rep I don’t have time to run a silo and farm WS for flux. Some times the queen is good to me and I get some yellow after wards but i have had a few fights lately that I didn’t get any flux / legendary reward. I chalked it up to bugs. 
---
One time I dropped and got back in before she was dead but no reward.  I was only able to get back because of the new public teams. I like the idea and have add some friends to play with if they are on.  Sorry got off topic there. 
---
Thanks for the info
---
Consider that this is a game where after every new content update, a lot of players STOP PLAYING out of fear that once again, hackers will be able to steal the equipment THEY ARE CURRENTLY WEARING.
---
Most games, players flood the servers to experience new content. Not this game - players are afraid to.
---
A female voice?!?!?
---
&lt;sending friend request&gt;  
---
I'm gonna give you lots of ammo and weapons! You like mini nukes right?
---
Sorry but we're  a bunch of millennials and xillennial
---
Programmer and that will take from looking at my unicorn rainbow farts.
---
That's actually a good indication. I assumed Bethesda automatically put him way ahead to pressure players to go up faster on the board by excess grinding or paying up.
---
Xbox
---
Yeah I see your point, as it states in the post it's a bug, needs to be fixed asap when people are spending real money on it
---
Display food objects would be even  better if they functioned like the drink dispensers,  load up some food onto them so that visitors can have a  bite.
---
This is why it's bad to play MMORPGs.  Because people spend ages leveling up and then have to "play down" to the other players who aren't built up.
---
These games need to have cap limits on servers and move you to a new server when you character gets too "overpowered".
---
From what I saw and heard and read it's definitely worth it. I made a stupid mistake and sided with Foundation and split the gold between both factions because I thought it's fair. I didn't know back then.. I'd give all my gold to make the rep raise faster, I've been doing same dailies for like 2 months already and still not there, but I will be soon! I really like the way it looks and sounds and with proper perks it's gonna be the deadliest weapon in my hands!
---
BGS hasn’t confirmed that it’s a bug.
---
I believe it’s intended...and that sucks.
---
I mean bug is that my junk is nowhere to find
---
Yeah, exactly xD
---
I really think sometimes is not about being generous and more about something really twisted deep down about our society. If you know what I mean.
---
I legitimately believe that they don’t play their own games. I think that much is pretty much a given. I also have a minor-conspiracy theory that they sit around and get off on people being frustrated and shit. You know, like Todd in a private room yanking it to this sub while porting Skyrim to my smart-pressure cooker.
---
Nice. That's good progress. I just want to hit rank 300 just to have all the legendary perks slots available. I'm currently at 263. Yea the level up once daily kinda sucks and is tedious but it's gotten me closer to 300. I've saved all the perk points AND left all the perk card packs unopened, just so we can see how Bethesda decides they want us to pay/swap/upgrade for the legendary perks.
---
If it's intended that you cannot add shielded lining then its a whole new level of retardation that I didn't think even the fallout devs were capable of
---
Just stop worrying about it.
---
Sounds about right, cheers mate! &lt;3
---
The team bait trick has been patched out. The team won’t get dragged into pvp only those directly shooting at each other.
---
Gatlings are capped at lvl 45.
---
Agreed, when they end up removing instead of fixing like they did with vault instances you'll be able to earn the "crap" another way FOMO is real.
---
Its opposite for me. Queen area have great fps for me, being empty overall. Watoga  or other cities for example,  have dips to 30-40 fps. I could have steady 60 fps but i refuse to play with shit graphic, game is singleplayer anyway 😁.
---
Whatever you make it to be!
---
Camp building. Minmaxing your perk card build and gear. Exploring every nook and cranny on the map. Playing with friends. Helping low-levels. Did I mention camp building?
---
Yup happy to help
---
You’re out of your mind lol. Even duped into oblivion people will pay max caps. Myself included. Those weapons are just too insanely powerful.
---
You should do the suggestion anyway, it's a huge QoL easy improvement.
---
Would gladly upgrade to the next gen of they had an updated graphics version that let us transfer our progress.
---
Go in. Hide in bush. Read reddit. Get rewards
---
It's a good way to pass the time when ya want to take a 10-15 minute break from gaming
---
Now you know
---
Any piece of furniture will work. Everyone always seems to put their bed next to an open window. That's usually how I get in.
---
It's pretty amusing actually, breaking in by climbing through windows into people's beds, lol.
---
Oh please no, I remember it from old counter strike, it looked creepy af xD I know the technology went far ahead from then, but I still find it pretty cringy.
---
I have a perfect for you junkies crossbow you may like.  It’s a junkies/50 crit damage/25% lower vats cost.  I was getting massive head shot numbers with it.
---
I saw someone selling toilet paper for 2020 that gave me a good laugh
---
As did many many people the first few months
---
Don’t even get me started on the T-65 jetpack camo paint bug..
---
Not until you collect your note though. Gotta have those 'you've been insulted' notes to leave in the bag with corn &amp; fertilizer.
---
Edit, oops, just reading the insult bot thread and completely missed that you were talking about the prize bot. No, I just shot that guy on sight.
---
How many people do you think the FO76 team currently consists off? I’m guessing it’s gotta be like 10 people and none of them are proper programmers, just graphic designers
---
No worries and best of luck!
---
I would love the feature tbh. I would move my ps4 progress to pc. Only reason I bought it on ps4 was for friends but they gave up on the game and its only me now. I can imagine the pc community is alot better aswell
---
Dunno where it went honestly. I've fallen in them and died and if you're quick enough you can respawn an jump back in an it won't kill you. I've done it a couple of times to get my loot bag and walked all over the "green lava". Still took rads like usual and casually jumped out of the pit like it's no biggie.
---
Them crossing the U.S. THIS early seems way too far fetched.  Even if they try and claim it's the operation that took airships East, only 25 years after the bombs?      
---
Nah, this makes zero sense and there is no way for it to remotely make sense unless it's another close by group Maxson was in contact with that joins up and then goes to investigate. 
---
Irregardless, they are going to need to be wiped out.
---
*"There are wind chimes where my ding dong should be."*
---
No it isn't.
---
You should let Bethesda know
---
Plenty of AAA titles come out and maintain glitches.
---
The difference is that Beth rarely fixes them.
---
We can't even get crossplay. You're dreaming too big.
---
You are the beta testers
---
well.. once a raider...
---
You’d have better luck asking Bethesda to change the way legendary drops are handled, dudes one shotting aren’t going to stop, cause someone asked them to.
---
Funny how a little whiney bitch like this can get 1k upvotes... Same folks who cried like bitches when their accounts got frozen for cheating. Like we get it Bethesda sucks. You going cry about it every god damn day? Quit being such losers.
---
loot boxes are a perfect example of predatory business practices. Fo76 doesn't have loot boxes, true. but it's filled with *other* predatory business practices. mostly taken from mobiles gachas.
---
and I've had the following conversation already, with other users. in this very same thread, in fact.
---
a lot of people didn't want Fo76 to be a service. it's partially why the first impression was so bad. so using it to justify the rampant monetization is not exactly a good argument. that on top of the fact that, almost 2 years later, we got little content and a laughable technical support. but I thought this was a service? so you're telling me they're sacrificing quality in favor of profit, and I get F-ing wastelanders in return?
---
wow. it's especially egregious considering Fo4 and Skyrim have twice the content and twice the quality and didn't rely on microtransactions. sure, the DLC was paid. but you're assuming I'd pay for wastelanders in the first place. I wouldn't. it's not good content. but it's a "service", right? so where did all the money go? certainly not into bug fixes or content creation.
---
and even if you use the server maintenance cost as an excuse, a **ton** of people asked for actual, local private servers. and that would offset their costs, no? except a huge chunk of their revenue model relies on the very fact that there are no local servers. so again, not a very good argument. not to mention they're obviously cheaping out on servers, too.
---
I also find it funny that you use the same justification as every other mobile gacha out there. "*oh*, you don't need the good stuff. it's entirely possible to play with the trash you find lying on the floor. we make the game as enticing as possible so you'll feel compelled to buy our overpriced cosmetics, but you don't \*really\* need them, so it's fine! nothing shady about our disingenuous revenue model. nuh-uh."
---
Same here, saved Beckett's brother and agreed to meet all three back at my camp. Got there and only Beckett was there. His first dialogue mentioned a funeral for the brother. Going into another dialogue option said his brother is currently off at some camp. Either way got the Final Word weapon and chalked it up to Bethesda being Bethesda.
---
Super annoying when you need to take 5 workshops for a weekly.
---
Between the Handmade and Fixer and Lever Action the rifles were already at the top of the food chain. Handguns and Shotguns and heavy energy weapons needed some love.
---
Np!! 👍👍
---
My end-game goal used to be completing quests and daily challenges in Survival Mode. It was exciting to have a harsher map to roam, but then they took out Survival Mode :(
---
My current end-game grind is submitting daily support tickets to the developers, requesting Survival Mode back, so that i can have an actual 'End-Game' to go back to.
---
There's a door to the RR garage?
---
Rifles got the fixer, melee got the sheep staff and club. Heavys, pistols and shotguns got nothing at that time.
---
You don't always get something new, it just wasn't your turn this go round
---
I keep hearing this but even after the unban I've see 2 guys with bloodied fixers one guy (super f ing cool) gave me a free 1 star. And a guy that had a god roll 2525 version and he wanted a be25 .50 cal and 2 legacys for it, so I dont see any of  the so call cheap duped items I keep hearing about
---
I agree, it feels like a slap in the face.
---
I suspect it's less about the perceived gender of your toon, and more about your lvl.  My husband and I each had several players do massive plan dumps for us when we were under lvl 25.  I know when I'm on my main, I look for players under lvl 20 to help up.
---
From 76 just head straight to anchor farm it will be on Ur left it's very near anchor farm but they s is the easiest way to find it, well for me anyway as I get honey there
---
Known thing since the launch of the game. And it doesn't have be a friendly players camp.
---
The only way to prevent it 100% is not to play the game.
---
These need to be made into posters.  I dont know how you did this...
---
just outstanding
---
Yep, can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at an event where some dude one shots, everyone starts the thumbs down emote party, than the dude vomit reacts and goes on one shotting
---
I alternate weapons and armor. One day I scrip all my weapons, then the next day I scrip all my armor. I really wver have that random 1 or 2 scrip left in the machine when I'm done.
---
They do seem to be happening less often.
---
The gauss pistol - FIRST OF ALL should have mods to make it automatic, I mean come on.
---
Secondly, should've been like a laser/plasma/Ultracite pistol which can be modded to become a rifle. This would've been a simple way to have included all forms of gameplay, with the most minimal amount of work needed
---
I use a railway rifle and it makes a choo choo noise Everytime I reload gotta love it
---
Okay so I did it and I realised the reason I couldn't repair them was because they hadn't lost all their health only like 90%
---
"For $100, you can avoid this!"
---
Todd Howard, probably
---
The ones I've seen always look like fish out of water.

Never seen this before, this would have been a great resource a while ago lol!

I just opened the vault last Friday with the raiders and split the gold. I was lucky to be able to buy 300 bullion Friday and then again on Saturday.  I was waiting for max rep to go in to 79 but after reading it was better to go in sooner and start collecting the gold. Which I agree with and should have broke in sooner.   I was collecting vault steel because I thought that is what I needed to craft with but I see now I should have been collecting legendary modules. Oh well I don’t have that much saved and I very rarely get anything worth selling / keeping anyways.
---
i totally agree.  Hey Bethesda, want to make the game harder? Just switch any boss level creature with that Mirelurk king.  Queen mirilurk too easy? Mirilurk king.  Wendigos not tough enough? Mirilurk king.  Behemoth Supermutants a breeze? Mirilurk king.  Scorch Beasts being swatted out of the air? Mirilurk king. Assaultrons not packing a punch? Mirilurk king.    
---
I'm a level 200 (in power armor) with a 2-shot minigun (that can usually mow down anything!) against a bullet sponge that kill me in a few hits. These guys are definitively end game creatures, they should be swarming the cranberry bog and fissure site prime. I'd rather face a 3 star scorch beast without power armor or cover than a  Mirilurk king any day.
---
I just want more build types to be viable, as well as new ones so basic things such as damage or defense upgrades shouldn't overshadow more interesting perks or effects on armor or weapons. It should just be regulated to tiers within it's own category such as modifications.
---
I think we need more unique builds and abilities when it comes to weapons/perks. Having too powerful effects ends up overshadowing anything else. It's better to keep damage and defense upgrades segregated, if you do have your armor and weapons upgrade dmg/def. have it then make it unique mechanic, or have it more rngey effect ...consistently not taking any damage  and being nearly invincible with stacking armor/perks/effects is why survival mode was basically canceled.
---
Keep dmg and armor upgrades 90% with quality of mods, and have different ammo types. Add more interesting effects that are not just freaking damage. It would also be a opportunity to add more interesting game mechanics when it come to bosses as well.
---
I use 9 points to boost weapon type damage and 3 points into bloody mess. Thats all there really is for full health damage increase unfortunately. Junkies + Psychobuff/psychotats + bobblehead/magazine is all there really is. I only use 8 of my 50 points to get DR like that (Barbarian + Ironclad).
---
sad but true. I hope they'll give us a break after this season's over. but not much else to do sadly. I wish there was more quests.
---
What exactly is it for then, if it’s not to outline potential bugs and issues that can arise with playing it?
---
Counting is hard for me too, bro.
---
PS4
---
Ok I’ll start that, I think the season bounties have been pushing me away from the quest. Time to double down!
---
Found it, thanks so much!!
---
Counter strike 1.6 was very creepy and funny at  the same time. mostly because the textures were very old
---
Same here my mains 333 but both my characters are female, too many dresses in game not to be. People are really generous.
---
It’s ALWAYS someone with a damn fixer whose in stealth. I hit the follow emote and the next thing I hear is the tell tale sound *tick tick tick tick* and the legendary is dead.
---
They'll probably throw that stuff in the atom shop and all of the people who didn't do the 'Run will feel pressured then to spend the less amount of atoms that they've earned on the stuff. By then, it will be in peoples minds, "hey I missed those skins during the run, I'll drop this 1200 atoms on them now"  
---
Bethesda: [ha-hah!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOPBP9vuZA)
---
This is half the reason I'm not gonna be able to finish the daily challenge for 3 legendary kills. The other half is I haven't been able to come across any legendaries. Came across several yesterday but everytime some level 200 would come up and one shot it. I managed to find one so far this morning. Doubt I'll find another 2 in the next 30 minutes 😕
---
I think it has to do with the hosting, timing, and collision. To save money/resources on the hosting side they try to load as few instances as possible and the more they can make you stay in one area looking at the same mob the better. Barely moving while you hose an indecipherable amount of bullets (aka stare at the mob motionless). One bullet at a time/stick and move seems really broken because the collision is bad in the engine and the timing is messed up from cheap hosting. The game is actually more of an RPG than in FO4 because of this. The most strategic/punishing game dynamic within 76 is economy, as it is an easy numbers game for simple AI to crush humans at.
---
Not a bad idea
---
[](/abhiupthere)Have you checked out [r/fo76FilthyCasuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)?
---
The story in Fallout 4, and your inability to really control it, was really disappointing.
---
The story basically came down to: Pick a faction and that’s the story.
---
Lame. I destroyed the BoS. I hope that’s the canon story. The East Coast brotherhood was out of control.
---
u/Valseek u/Ladydevann u/CM_PipBoy u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
part of your problem is your build for sure.. this could be better optimized even without getting too overly min/maxy about it
---
If anyone would ever join my building teams sure. After sitting for 5 minutes waiting for someone to join, 95% of the time unsuccessfully I will join whatever team has an open spot. I would be an idiot to hold onto that plus 1 inteligence from a solo build team and give up 15% bonus xp from inspirational and potential mutation bonuses with strange in numbers.
---
If it happens again and you fall into the pit, quickly jump and you will die in the air which will leave your loot bag floating.
---
You will be able to retrieve it that way
---
I don’t think it’s so bad, true I’m wating for some new quests but I enjoy having these chores. I really like stringing dailies together to save on fast traveling costs. It’s like a daily puzzle
---
There already is a Gauss rifle in the game
---
It's worse then you probably think it is. Every end game activity is a monotonous grind behind a time gate. New plans? Gold grind. You want to get a good roll on your new plans you just spent a week grinding to get? Time to grind legendary modules and hope you get the 1/255. Don't forget to jump 50 times or repair 3 pieces of armor for your daily challenge when you login to do your chores for the day!
---
You act like Bethesda gives a shit what you say and assume anyone with any power is watching everyone whine. News flash they don't care and you're yelling into the wind. Play the game and shut up. This poster is being a whiney fuckn child. Don't like the game don't play.
---
It’s strange, there were two people in their lower levels  that i gave stuff to. One who was in a power armor frame and i crafted all the pieces for it and gave it to that person. It wasn’t until after that the person revealed she was a female (saying thank you on the mic) and i felt guilty about it after the fact. It’s hard to tell if someone is male or female in power armor.
---
Another one i saw low level items in the vendor and saw they were in their camp and i dropped a bunch of recipes and then they revealed they were female (saying thank you on the mic and if I’d like anything free from her vendor) and again i felt guilty. 
---
I was trying to be nice because they were low level, not because they were female!
---
I like breaking in and buying something when they've locked their vendors behind doors but left them powered.
---
The grind sucks the fun out of the game.
---
Tnx for advice
---
Bro I hate that response, like no matter how predatory Bethesda is or grindy they make the content, there's always the one guy that's like "DoNt dO iT" like I don't want to experience the content I spent 60 bucks on
---
are you on pc or console?
---
Also had a similar problem on ps4. 
---
I had lost a few items, but would just shut off the system when I had to leave. Best idea, i believe is to fast travel (after aquiring an item), leave the server, then close the game, then shut down the system. Just gives layers of log outs to make sure progress is kept.
---
I don't know how, but  I'm constantly at my scrip limit and I have a lot of modules already, mostly because I get a lot of 3* stuff but with shitty perks nobody wants xD I buy a bit of modules and steel daily just to lower the amount of scrip I have to be able to sell shitty stuff again. it's an endless circle lol
---
I have the fridge and the small ice box that came with the log cabins. Both are placed and have items in them. So you can use one of each it seems.
---
New Vegas is overrated.
---
I installed the "Anti-Simp Protocols" mod on the helmet of my power armor which prevents me from dropping stimpacks and ammo for more female low levels than male. I have much more dignity now.
---
Fair enough, it's just a game . Good luck.
---
I like the survival aspects honestly not looking forward to the hunger and dehydration changes.
---
Yeah, Zorbo moves a space per day (from what I've seen) and the goal is to beat him to the end. It's about mid-september too when he finally reaches the end so the timing matches. :)
---
Remove the limit
---
Yeah I was picking perks as I leveled, pistols early game, then rifles, then big guns, it’s all a mess. It seems like i’m stuck for awhile too, I wasn’t able to find a way to reset them.
---
Yeah, me too, I really felt the rush in the beginning but now I just want it over xD but it depends on your perspective I guess.
---
With public teams, as long as your close, you should still be able to get the legendary which is nice. However it doesn't count for the "legendary kills" daily or weekly challenge which is annoying
---
There always the open world legendary spawns.  Don’t need to stick to events to get Legendaries.  
---
Killing legendaries is just the go to thing now  in events. You can’t rely on it.  
---
Before SCORE, I ran in a lot of players playing nice with sharing legendaries.  Since SCORE it’s nothing but a crap show at events.
---
Radiation Rumble 
---
Guided Meditation
---
Lmao I like the game and I’ve played since launch, and contrary to what you seem to think, Wastelanders came about because *people wanted NPCs*
---
But sure, keep reinforcing the exact stereotype that I think of when someone criticises the Bethesda being terrible at bug fixes 👍
---
there are a few ways around it. it's easier on PC. always leave the game through the map, never forcefully close it. fast travel somewhere after you get a good legendary, that's when the game is saved. use atom shop skins on your favorite gear, they make it so the item doesn't show in selling, scripping or scrapping windows. change worlds if the one you're in is particularly laggy and avoid equipping/unequipping gear in Queen fights, or having your weapons and armor break, or even using repair kits on them mid-fight.
---
on PC, rebind the reload key. I use T instead. and physically remove the R key from your keyboard. there's also a mod called "save my stuff" or something that adds an extra layer of security.
---
but even then, this is something related to the poor netcode and can happen at any time. something as innocent as moving things around in your stash can cause items to disappear.
---
My first Gaiss minigun crafted was a Bloodied ffr.
---
I just wish they would let us over scrip. say you have 3 scrip left but you only have a 1 star weapon, just give us a warning that if we use it as scrip we will miss out on 2 scrip. Do this and things would be so much simpler.
---
Nope not believing you just made a cute female with pink hair. All those aren’t accidental choices. 
---
Just own it and move on.
---
I wish they had put in some sort of spooky hauntings that can randomly happen like:
---
having junk randomly move locations (for example, having a pot that was on the shelf randomly fall onto the floor or having a ball randomly rolliing down a hallway).
---
Spooky sound files like 'ghostly laughter' could have been something easy to implement. 
---
They could have even set it up to have random writing show up on the walls then fade away.
---
It's not that counting is hard, it's that many times I quite literally do not have items that will add up to 150 no matter how I scrip them.
---
Meta builds can make grinding out things like the legendary run easier, but they're definitely not required. A YouTuber did a no mutations, no legendary playthrough and was able to solo the Scorched Beast Queen before he even hit level 50.
---
You can do this with any item that you can interact with - chairs, beds, music instruments as well as workbenches.
---
Always amuses me the amount of times I see camps locked up, but can access an interactive item through a window. I just have to use it - I often drop a bobby pin on the floor to confuse people.
---
players attacked you and your teammates and you retaliated.  Seems perfectly normal to me.
---
Anyone who initiates pvp needs to be comfortable with the potential outcome.  If they can't handle losing including damage to their camp if they are stupid enough to pvp near it or have vendors active so it's visible on the map then they shouldn't have started a fight in the 1st place.
---
The game has pacifist mode for players that don't want to pvp.
---
ok well have fun doing a part of the game you hate, is free added content, and isn't required in any way. 👍
---
Ever since the dupewave those poor alpha predators and sheepsquatchs stand no chance. They go down almost instantly because of the one asshole with a BE Gatling plasma.
---
It's a high level hangout, they buff the levels up.
---
Visiting on priv server tends to spawn them much lower level, I'm over 200 and on priv they often spawn at 16 or whatever..
---
It seems to be random as hell, tbh. I've had almost dead servers with nothing going, and servers where it's a rush from one to another. There's no rhyme or reason to it.
---
It depends on the location. The Ash Heap ones work. Cranberry Bog one Nope, Mire one works one is bugged.
---
Nah, it's INT for crafted items. Luck for finding items in the wild. Same for condition of Weapons &amp; Armor. ;)
---
Woah! What armour are you using?
---
I seem to have the same problem. So I was stopping in when I was close pull 2-3 crappy 3/* weapons and some vault steel.  Then I would feed the weapons back into the machine. I’ll just switch to modules when I stop in. Good thing most items don’t take that many modules to craft from what I was seeing.
---
Every time I made this recipe I had the same prob. It made me sad! It came from oven PERFECT then flopped as it cooled. 🥺
---
private servers or wait until you can take on level 60 mobs.
---
It's not free added content idiot, where do you think Bethesda gets the funds to pay the designers? By preying on the whales and established players with bullshit grindy monetization schemes. Same way they do it on mobile games. I bought a survival looter shooter, not a fucking mobile mmorpg
---
grounded will pump up that er stat ;)
---
Vanguards Secret service
---
Turning on (and repairing when necessary) the jukebox should allow you to complete the challenge even with the new timer. Someone will probably have to play music for a minute, but it is still feasable.
---
Now if I could just figure out how to glitch water purifiers...
---
Thanks! I’m going to try a private server.
---
This is the part where we learn there's really only 50 of us playing multiple different characters and constantly paying it forward in a big loop.
---
A bloodied sheepsquatch staff, with faster swing speed and reduced weight, or str bonus.
---
Yes I agree on this too, I've realized if you continue holding down trigger it will discharge ammo in inventory for a few short seconds too. It is very annoying though how off time it is and numbers not being zero.
---
I was like that up until a few months ago, when the rewards were too good to miss and I finally worked up the courage to try my first BR mode. Now, I do kind of like it. I even managed to actually kill 2 different players last night defending a teammate! That was pretty awesome, especially for me!
---
The stealth part is what infuriates me most. Like, if you gotta be the first to hit that fucking mole miner, do you REALLY have to hit it for x2.5 damage? Just to make sure no one else gets to participate??
---
Max caps? Lmao. Who trades in caps? I know at least 15 players that got unbanned with 4 mules at maxed weight with nothing but B2525 handmades, fixers, and legacies. So I guess it comes down to who you know.
---
I think bloodied grognaks with faster swing speed +1 str still wins for 2h for top end burst from sneak damage.  Though if you want to have some fun get a bloodied faster swing speed mr handy buzz saw (electrified) Kills scorchbeasts in 3 seconds flat, it does about 3K dps on average a second.
---
Thanks for the tip cutie ;)
---
No-one is behind. We don't NEED to finish it. It's not a requirement.
---
I think I’ll just suit up in some PA, grab a mini gun and hop on a private server. I hate leaving these quests in my pipboy knowing I could be unlocking new things to do if I could just get through. Thank you!
---
Yeah, I do the same. I have around 25 modules and for now it's more than enough. Crafted a few pieces of SS armor and each piece only used 1 module. So I'm taking it easy, because they weigh not that little and my stash is almost full.
---
You may want to play other MP games that arent 76 and see just how shitty it is.
---
While not necessary you will find enemy's much harder to kill without a decent build. And if you can't kill things quickly they will kill you quickly
---
the enemies on your first spawn point are always scaled down. I have my camp near blackwater mine and unless I travel somewhere else before I quit the game, the next time I log in the mole miners there will be level 6 or something.
---
Non automatic.
---
If they want to add mods to make that automatic, fine by me
---
Don’t be too discouraged, you could luck out on a few more tries. My first one was yesterday and it was a one star mutant slayers. The second one popped out a two shot/FFr/25lvc. That’s the best luck I’ve ever had in this game.
---
I made the same joke to a friend, I think we're on to something!
---
I'd be happy if the vendors and scrip machine reset at the same time. Each day.
---
I get in a bush right in the middle of the map. Then walk away for 20 mins. Usually get top 10. Got 2nd a couple of times
---
I agree, but I’d like to finish it.  I want that dumbass space suit skin. 😂
---
That’s why I said ‘it is what it is’.
---
Impressive! How do you take those pictures without being killed?
---
true. a guy had his armco machine unlocked. felt *really* tempted to change his selected ammunition to .38 or .44.
---
Oh this is why people call me a man or guy on mics despite playing a female character. Not that i mind. Hidden in plain sight!
---
I would have nuked it if it wasn’t right on top of both our camps.
---
They're more about efficiency.  You can kill that super mutant with one shot or 30.  Do you want to spend 10000 bullets or a 1000 to kill the sbq.  Also time efficiency, you could spend an hour or under a minute to do the same thing.
---
sheepsquatch staff, supersledge, grognaks axe are all decent.  iirc the staff has the highest base damage when fully modded out but it's close so all are roughly equivalent.
---
If none of the above are available to you, the wayward questline will reward a bss sledgehammer if you pick the 2 handed weapon option when plundering the treasure at the end.  Slap a heated rocket mod and that will tide you over till you find something better.  If you already completed that quest ppl sell that thing for a few caps pretty frequently, 
---
protip: To top off your health instead of stimpacks use a vampires buzzblade ;)  The rest of the stars don't matter even a 1\* is fine.
---
no. vanguard's and high dr/er is mostly useless. a mixed set of creature-specific solar armor is more useful.
---
I don't see it ever being a possibility. If they had cross play first then maybe but for such a niche market there isn't money in transferring profiles to different systems
---
Mannequins to display clothing/armor sets. Would be interesting to have a store as a CAMP. We already have gas stations, doughnut shops, log cabins, etc. This would just add some new flavor.
---
i love when people hate the game they spend so much time on. play something else if you're not having fun, dummy. don't do the legendary run if you find it stupid. it's not rocket science.
---
Ummm combat shotgun w/ enforcers? 
---
I say that because I went into a nuked whitesprings in a hazmat suit and that combo is the only way I survived. Kneecapped a lot of glowing ones. 
---
Maybe stealth suit. 
---
Or you could see if any high levels are clearing out WS and follow in their wake. Probably not, most people just concentrate on the club house.
---
Its actually a fair analogy even if the subject matter is disheartening.
---
The system itself is just wrong. People do events not just for legendaries but if there is one (or multiple) I'm pretty sure everyone would want a piece as a nice bonus. Besides it's a way to kill 2 birds with one stone when you need both an event and a legendary. Some people will always be like this regardless of the legendary run.
---
Just take the stuff and drop it off in the overseers cache for true newbies to find.
---
Alot of the players I know hand them out to their close group. They don't sell or trade them because there is nothing out there they need now.
---
I wish they'd give it a skin or a redesign to make it appear like the other gauss weapons, in the least.  And, while they're working on the gauss rifle, they can make those weapons a bit less inconsistent.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel "honorable"... intresting choice of words. Maybe in FO3, but in 1,2 and NV I'd say indiffernt to others who don't have tech they want to steal at best and assholes in FO4.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely with you there! HaHa. Keep going though! What level on the board are you at now?
---
It's a time honored tradition. Welcome to the fold.
---
Didnt think of that, I was just bringing up those numbers. Might have to grind out some solar armor soon.
---
I’ve played since beta and I have played NW. except I played it when it came out and it was brand new. 
---
When I initially played it I thought “oh wow this could turn into something fun” but like 100 years passed and it’s still early access with all of its bugs, glitches, and overall low performance.
---
I didn’t actually play it until The Legendary Run and I was pleasantly surprised to be earning Christmas rewards and Halloween rewards but that was a bug. I really though for a small window of time Bethesda was intentionally giving the influx of new players some of the rewards they missed but nope - just a bug.
---
I have never really tweaked it seriously and I doubt I can
---
Just remembered something i would kill for. I want Biv as a companion!
---
It'd blow my mind if Bethesda hired a competent writing staff for the next game and the opening narration started with "War... War has changed."
---
I actually think some of the Bethesda devs feel the same; listen to the Maxson holotapes, the guy comes off as a loon in this game.
---
Unfortunately Bethesda as a whole is mostly interested in selling Fallout's style over substance, and the BoS sells.
---
I have been playing something else you bootlicker. You're the same type of person to say "move to another country if you don't like America" unlike you, I'm not a coward, and if I love something, I want it to be the best possible version of itself. And this ain't it, chief. And if people don't stop kissing Bethesdas ass and say something, it's just gonna get worse.
---
Your junk is probably at the bottom of the pit where you died
---
I think you're right and I kinda regret the wording of my post.  My intent was to be about a low level being given stuff that it didn't need rather than the character being female.
---
Try to sneak your way in with the sneak perk card. The house with the holotape contains 8 ghouls. 1 glowing upstairs and 1 mostly outside @ the back of the building. 
---
Sometimes they are distracted by the activity at the gate with the robots behind the building.
---
I played 1200 hours before wastelanders and maybe 80 after. The game isn't the same as the one I bought, and I don't like the direction it's being taken.
---
Don't pick someones shit then. Easy. Done. No bounty ever. if I want a bounty I go out and I specifically get one. The bounty is a repercussion for being a dick and stealing from people. Don't steal from people.
---
Been doing this with a gauss pistol.
---
Hah, yes, you get trash cards to start with, but you will get better ones as you level up. 
---
At 50 there's one card in particular you'll unlock and will want to grab and level - Super Duper.
---
Base level is a 10% to craft 2 items for the price of 1, and maxed is 30%. Combine this with Ammosmith (which increases ammo yield by up to 80%) you can have near unlimited ammo.
---
What system you playing on? If PS4 I might be able to help you with some bits to aid your journey. 👍🏻
---
I run a VE Combat with a stealth suit and do the same. Never any issues myself.
---
the criteria in the atom shop for price of items are just off. I understand bundles being more expensive for obvious reasons but single items seem to be all over the place such as the bobble head stand
---
The moral option IS NOT STEALING FROM PEOPLE. Stop whining like a little kid
---
Good idea, much easier than finding another character to gift it too.
---
if you played 1200 hours, I'd say you got your 60 bucks worth and anything else is cake.
---
46. 500 points away from 47 I think. I don’t think I I leveled it up Tuesday when I played. I needed to level up to finish my dailies and I knew I wasn’t gonna get there with the playing time I had and I’m not making another toon. I never do the NW challenges either. I’m
---
prepared  to spend atoms  if I’m close in the end. The double score event really helped. I missed the first 7-8 days of the event, so I had a late start.
---
What end game content?
---
I was originally going to say no. 
---
my main doesn't have a specific build and I've done pretty much what my bloody has done, quest wise. It may take longer but I don't die as much. 
---
But I do have the appropriate cards for my equipment. That is basically what a build is.
---
Start a roleplaying character.  I get on my main (255 bloodied cammando) do some daily's and some farming, get my max caps script and gold then when I get board I switch to roleplaying.  
---
Caveman character: I use only wood or leather armor and only use primitive weapons like a spear, bone hammer or cultist blade ( bow for ranged)
---
Civil war soldier: only use leather or metal armor and only use black powder weapons and revolutionary war sword.
---
These builds are by no means the most powerful but they are a hell of a lot of fun and it makes the game an actual challenge again
---
If I had to guess I would say its at least in the realm of possibility that you may have to just do a fresh install. 
---
I have never had any issues running silos, but I dont do them as most do so I might be skipping problem areas.
---
A lot of people seem to get into the optimized meta buildout, which is fine if they truly like that stuff, but it’s far from necessary. Thoughtful perk card choices really are key to making all sorts of builds viable. The best builds are the ones you genuinely enjoy playing, not the builds the inter webs insist you need.
---
Whitespring at level 10? Jesus....
---
Still here 4 months later.  As an added bonus the "find bone meal" part is ALSO bugged as the radio sends you in circles with no real info as to where to find it.
---
It’s gotten to the point with Bethesda where they’ll ship something as long as it runs, and then fix it over the coming weeks. 
---
I don’t want to pry, but Bethesda, are you so strapped for cash that you need those 20 dollars right this second?
---
Uranium Fever, One Violent Night and Campfire Tales are the worst for this. Saw the same player (level 250 or so) 1-shot all the legendaries at all 3 yesterday. Blocked them and server hopped.
---
I plenty of times have done it and only needed one. If I see some one else is around when I’m doing it and just need one I try to wait for them. Though this doesn’t happen often and one time the person must have been waiting on me cause I eventually caved cause I wanted to get the event for a daily and I didn’t want to fail waiting for them.
---
Should be at whitespring station.
---
ooh yes you're so brave, standing up for video game rights. I'm sure you're due a statue, a real national hero for our time, buddy.
---
And most of the time when you try to place objects in it they pop up onto the roof
---
lol I made a post about this a bit ago called Handouts or Dumpster. Most people are just giving up stuff for weight. but yea I get guilty when someone drops something that's in my store to sell already.
---
Because god forbid anything in this game be convenient and make sense
---
I think the Brotherhood of Steel is cool and all and don’t mind it returning but 100% agree with anyone that we need other factions that make the region unique and fresh.
---
That's why they're known as bugthesda
---
I may have the plans in my vending machine. I’ll check tonight after work.
---
Hey now, us low levels don’t know any better lol. Plus I think I was expecting “old fallout” and I was given a very rude awakening
---
never touched it.  for pvp there are so many better games out there
---
On Xbox they had fo76 as part of their game pass and I have sold shload of stuff. Probably 40k or more and most stuff I have is 25 - 100 caps (plans aid mags ammo). So I was doing good on space and it’s now full again. Just with other stuff.  
---
Since I have moved my camp to a lead node and selling ammo that has helped with the caps income.  I have been buy the ammo that I normally use (5mm, fusion cells and plasma cores when i see them) to help keep me under max caps.
---
That's a really old one.
---
Lol, how did he do that? Can you share a link?
---
The problems continue. Honestly I didn't even see that bug because a building in which 3 of its walls are imaginary just didn't merit construction for me.
---
Wait, the items are still in your stash? Bummer I was hoping to find a way to decrease the consumables in my stash.
---
Lol, lil whiny baby whining about someone else whining. real good look, bro
---
Yeah they don’t exist really. People are still expecting valuable items for trades. This guy may have friends who dupe but he’s not describing reality to those of us who don’t have friends with 30 b2525 handmades at all.
---
Truthfully, I’m still only level 40. Compared to the level 1000+ people I’ve seen on here (Jesus) I have a very long way to go. I’m just afraid to go back with my lil shotgun and auto rifle and try to take those guys on so maybe I’ll just wait a bit
---
an item is only worth the value you place on it. To him, that item was probably worth 200 caps. You probably did him a service by freeing up inventory space. I wouldnt stress over it.
---
200 stimpacks? I am doing something wrong.. I never have more than.. 5 or so on me. Where do you farm yours?
---
Personally, I think you’re better off without ironclad if there’s somewhere else you could put those points. Even if it’s just back into a defense skill. If you don’t have glowing enemy dmg that would be a good one or class freak/strange in numbers if you use mutations, or any vats boosters could help pump your numbers a bit more.
---
Not telling you what you have to do and maybe you already have a lot of these, just trying to help if you did like having that junkie build from F4! 
---
Even with bloodied, I just phased out barbarian in favor of 3* incisor because it wasn’t making a noticeable difference behind my ss armor.
---
I'll admit, sometimes I'm not really paying attention with gun-fu and will insta-kill a legendary. But usually when I'm playing like that I'm playing off by myself anyways. I've used the "follow me" a few times but never has anyone on my public team shown up, so I don't feel bad about it anymore.
---
However, I almost always use my auto suppressors tesla rifle during events, especially events that are known to spawn legendary enemies pretty regularly. Gotta get all of that sweet sweet xp. The loot is nice too.
---
Haha now you chime in!! 😂 I just finished building the chest piece yesterday!
---
You're doing not too bad at all actually. Keep at it, still quite a while to go! Try and get your INT and XP up! That repeatable XP challenge is very very handy. I usually only do the NW ones if they're real easy, i.e. Place Camp etc.
---
If i got a Junkies ffr Gauss id def use it more
---
I like it, but that ammocrafting is a PITA for it
---
Alright what’s your gt
---
Nope it wasn’t
---
The brotherhood are a bunch of entitled assholes. Enclave is better
---
That would be me. Started playing in Nov 2018. No FO1 or NW.
---
Same as my reddit
---
Equip the fireworks mine from the legendary run and see if it makes you reload faster it makes guns reload almost instantly
---
I was (and still) really dissapointed about building.
---
Not just that you cant build close to static objectives, but you wasnt able to scrap a lot.
---
Also you cant connect bases together which would ne awesome if you play a lot with friends.
---
This could have been solved with mods but I doubt we will ever see those kind of mods.
---
I am lvl 130. Just recently started soloing WS myself. Got my build and weapons diled in 1st. They used to smash me.
---
So they’re not worth much more than 200 caps in your opinion, but they’re also virtually unobtainable. Makes sense.
---
That and it takes up half of your screen
---
talk about cooking the golden goose! money men ruin everything
---
yeah I'm sure some higher level people probably steal stuff out of there but in general, I assume mostly lower level people are getting stuff they need that way. at that this point, i kinda assume a lot of the lower people I see are secondary characters or mules, whereas people actually doing the main quest line will need to hit up the overseers area.
---
It's baffling that this isn't a thing. Especially considering you can hit max scrip and they'll still let you mulch away.
---
I'm on my phone at the moment... It was Angryturtle. If you search him on YouTube you should find pretty easily.
---
You can’t drop SS armor.
---
Unless they changed somethingt recently,  SS items can't be dropped or traded. Nice thought though.
---
I, uh, "lucked into" a couple hundred legendary modules because I did the math on how long it would statistically take to get the set that I want, and mindlessly grinding for half a year is not an appropriate use of my time. Was able to complete my set pretty easily.
---
Im kinda confused, why not kill a legendary in 1 shot?
---
Strange, if I was on xbox I'd go pick you one up.
---
That too, but when i do Sbq fights my chameleon armor goes off so its invisible.
---
same with my Junkie Gat Laser
---
Love those weapons Everyones in PA and im running around in my possum shorts lighting her up like a christmas tree
---
I get weird bugs happen to me sometimes. Like my weapon won’t have the need to reload. Almost like infinite ammo( not complaining) but the silos always give me problems. I’m on Xbox so I guess I just uninstall and reinstall?
---
Yeah I have no enjoyment for the game anymore so that’s why I don’t play
---
How'd that assaultron fair? I think that's my favorite shot.
---
I also did this.
---
Started as a stealth sniper.
---
Found myself not pulling my weight in events so I started using heavy guns, and had to re-spec my character.
---
So it's not just you.
---
But there are perfectly viable stealth builds, you may need to visit player vendors to look for weapons.
---
Level 35 you should be fine, just need to sneak. Maybe try bringing a friend to distract them? A level 10 should be nowhere near there though haha especially since the sword you get as a reward can’t even be used until 25 iirc
---
The ammo factory pales in comparison to what you can craft. You just need a set of Excavator and make daily trips to the Lucky Hole Mine. You'll produce far more ammo in much less time.
---
you're running concentrated fire?
---
Not really. It's quite possible with the right perks, special points and equipment to remove just about any challenge in the game. 
---
It seems like the players that go that route, then end up being the most bitchy about the game, because their play depends on getting that gear. So every time they do something in hopes of getting what they want, and not getting it, makes them so angry.
---
So it really depends on how you want to play the game.
---
That would be where I would start at least. It kinda fixed my vats melee problem inside of interior cells at least for awhile it did. But then it unfortunatly started again.
---
Yea but if you have the enforcer perk you can cripple the ghouls and they are no problem
---
This makes me feel all sorts of pain as a pa user, but it makes me damn proud too
---
I have over 3500 hours in, jump into UF nearly every time I see it and FINALLY JUST got the bundle about a month ago.
---
Didn’t it use to be a thing? I thought it was and subsequent removed
---
Ok, thanks. Will search
---
I've seen the Watoga bots take out  legendary scorchbeats
---
I accidentally did one time and felt horrible because I did the come here emote at the same time
---
Just leveled up, gonna equip that perk now. Thanks!
---
No. Not necessary. They make it easy, sure. But you don’t need to min max. I personally find that a bit boring.
---
Yo I'm on ps4 could I add you so you could place the barrel in my camp?
---
30s to get 80 lead per gym you rob, granted you must wait 2 days or pick up 256 items before you can hit the same one again.  I've always found this the fastest method.
---
Yeah sometimes they don’t break if the mole miners are killed quickly
---
I dont think I have that on do I need it to target limbs?
---
What does this even mean ? New player asking.
---
That's sad. Thank you!
---
I honestly don't know but I do believe an entity of the Australian government did give them some flack. I do not know the results you'd have to inquire there.
---
Oh, man.  There's one time that I did and I felt so bad about it.
---
I do Uranium Fever to farm Black Titanium.  The event rewards are just cake.  I play a stealth rifleman build, so I just get in the bucket by extractor Charlie and shoot anything that goes to attack it.  Usually about a dozen kills, and more than half drop the suit scrap.  Yay!
---
I see this one come over the stairs and drop it without thinking.  Then I see angry emotes from the big room and someone comes over to give me a thumbs down.
---
After the event as I'm collecting my loot, I saw I had plugged a 3* legendary before anyone got off a shot.
---
Feels bad, man.
---
Hunter’s probably. Due to diminishing returns you’ll probably get more out of a Hunter’s with tank killer and piercing mag.
---
These people are the worst arseholes in the game.
---
They are always like level 400 plus as well.
---
Can confirm still broken, just walked through the back of someone’s backwoods bungalow
---
These are amazing! I have yet to fight the wendigo colossus!
---
Right its all but there already, I would think it would be simple to add.
---
Any that you find that are bloodied will work. Swing speed is an added bonus , 1 str a slight hair bit better.  Most of you damage comes from food, radicool, and unyielding armor
---
I would love this so much.  My Xbox character has been since beta and I have lots of atom skins and ofc progress.
---
It's easier for the company to ban then to correct and admit their errors. That's an extremely dangerous business practice very shady.
---
Well if it was removed, that went over my head lol. I use my scrip daily on modules, so I very well could be wrong
---
So you have to guess who is going to one shot things and quickly join their team before they do it? Good advice
---
My main is an unarmed specialist, but I carry around a level 5 pipe pistol for exactly this reason
---
PvP is not the only thing you suck at.
---
No one would be buying from you, you simply can not corner the market.
---
If you're putting in the foundation yourself, Cranberry Bog has some decently open areas.
---
Absofuckinglutely my friend! Make this rpg game more like an rpg, you know where you have to role play with your build/class etc as opposed to “get this legendary weapon and equip this perk card to become god👍”
---
Anything I learned about the game I keep strictly to myself I do not share it with friends, absolutely no one. I've been bitten on the ass more than once.
---
NW mode from it's inception has been little more than Beth chasing that Fartnite money. "You guys surprised us by actually working together in 76, now here's BR mode" at the announcement sums up their view perfectly.
---
It's proven to be a collosal waste of time and resources,  caused one of the two big content droughts (wasteoftimelanders being the second) and the only way they can even get people to play it is to force you, either via limited cosmetics/camp items or more recently score challenges.
---
Don't even get me started on them making that mess of a mode canon too, rendering any "rebulding" ultimately useless because it's all gonna burn.
---
Ok dope, cause I'm lvl 36 and dont wanna get attacked but I'll try there as a possibly location.
---
Me who uses pipe weapons:
---
Horse armor. That's all anyone need say on the subject.
---
1000+ hours in adventure and about 10 minutes in NW. But it wasn’t as bad as I was expecting tbh. Just the waiting times were a pain.
---
Thanks all for the detailed answers!
---
Actually I feel we should have players actually choose their side. Let’s create an *actual* difference with consequences in the story for choosing a side. Currently there is no legit difference between siding with raiders over settlers or vice versa.
---
I think an even like this is the perfect way to go passed the tipping point where you actually have to choose. 
---
Though I think yes more rep for winning still get rep if you lose
---
This is great! I had a nocturnal SS +str machete that i named 'Friday the 13th'
---
Exactly.  PC will always truck on.  But what about those PS4 players who are moving to Xbox series x.  Or vice versa?
---
Accounts need to be cross platform.  Sure I get cross play issues.  But cross platform would only be a win win for Bethesda.
---
But they have done it wrong.  PC game pass is a new account and although puts with PC lobbies, the atom accounts are separated.  This has caused issues with steam users who use the Bethesda launcher to see atom challenges not being rewarded.  Just make it universal!
---
you said unique flat spot, pretty much no such place unless you want to build out onto water. New gad has flat spots whitespring has flat spots bog has flat spots with 1 area that is almost perfectly flat and you can mine two resources by watoga. There are actually a lot of flat buildable areas in the bog but the issue is lack of people to come see your wares.   
---
You could also build along a roadway that has piles of junk/destroyed cars quite a lot of those around in the savage divide.
---
meh.. Im the mayor.. they dont fuck with me anymore.. lol
---
My osmosis kit never leaves my inventory so I autocomplete the settlers quest every single day. I only have to return it, yet it still never leaves my inventory.
---
You lookin" at me? How 'bout you stop lookin' and start buyin'.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
The whole system could use some work. The armor is multiples of 3 and weapons in multiple of 5, and a limit of 150 per day to trade in for. Seems good on paper but its not so great in practice, like communism. 
---
I think it should just be multiples of 5 for both, and weapons can still be a little more valuable. 
---
Armor: 5, 15, 25
---
Weapons: 10, 25, 50
---
Scrip daily limit: 300
---
Edit: I also think the max scrip limit (along with max caps and gold bullion limit) should be increased from 1000 to a multiple of 300, with the lowest being 1500 and the highest possible being 3k.
---
taking 5 points from ironclad also cuts my endurance on half which is a large loss of health for nothing as theres literally nothing else for those points to go on. I have my 9 ranks of weapon damage, bloody mess, glow sights, gun fu and when it's fixed; adrenaline. Theres nothing for me to put thise points in.
---
I was personally hoping for events like this that would happen *at* each HQ. For foundation I was hoping the raiders would set out to raid Foundation, and at Crater I was hoping the settlers would liberate what was stolen from them. 
---
This would’ve been like an all out war and you would’ve seen just how different the factions are
---
Very direct post.  Any suggestions though? I'd love to see more modus content.  It felt very fresh and welcome to the fallout universe. Granted enclave have always been around.
---
I'd like an all in one stash box. Make the scrap box an add-on to the stash box that reduces scrap weight to zero.
---
They are pretty terrible.  They are totally unreliable in VATS, and they cannot deal with swarms of enemies due to the slow fire rate.
---
The only use I've found for them is that the Flame Arrows version is pretty good for tagging large masses of enemies, like at Line in the Sand.  I tried using Cryo Arrows on the Queen, but it does exactly what it says - applies a slow effect for 3 seconds, which is almost the time you need to set up another shot - which makes them inferior to the Cryolator.
---
I wish they were more viable.  High Perception builds are kind of railroaded into Rifles and don't have anything else they can naturally fallback on.
---
Ok I took it off when moving my perks around thanks it's been driving me crazy
---
No problem.
---
they're not wrong, though...
---
it might not be the correct way to handle it, but they're not wrong.
---
I love the dedication to your character. Sounds like you're really having fun and that's the name of the game!
---
Its possible Bethesda will do nothing with the enclave but i think we will get some stuff next year. If they are not involved in the bos storyline. 
---
Have not really seen a lot of people point out that bos has an obsession with technology and modus is sitting on probably the biggest pile of tech in the area. Modus computer system alone has to be worth a war to the brotherhood.
---
Eventually a brotherhood soldier will hear rumors of the whitesprings bunker or find information after taking down one of the bots under modus control. Its only a matter of time before the tin can soldiers piss off modus  and war starts
---
There's always the Nuka Quantum X-01 paint.
---
Shared vendor caps would like to have a word with you..
---
Thats not enclave paint thats quantom paint
---
You are half way through as you are familiar with the atmosphere. I am not a pro but I may have some tips for fellow fallout players :)
---
1. I mostly played single player to understand the story and didnt want to attach to some players until I completed all main and side quests.(you may want to use lone wanderer perk card under charisma)
---
2. You may want to unfollow all irrelevant quests which you dont aim to complete soon to clean up the window.
---
3. Dont waste your time with team events before you complete the main quest, unless you dont want to complete daily/weekly challanges and if the quest does not lead you to the event like "Encryptid". You will be rewarded with gold bullions only after you complete the main quest.
---
4. Quests can be overdose for new players but just take a deep breath and choose one story at a time to follow.(This depends on people though)
---
5. Join Building Teams for extra intelligence/exp.
---
6. Early in the game, I used melee weapons not to care about ammo but you can also craft ammo by tinker stations.
---
7. Care while claiming workshops as other players can attack and steal your junk.
---
8.You will eventually get used to the new fallout system. Give some time, dont rush &amp; have fun :)
---
These points are obviously subjective and open to discussion, feel free to correct.
---
When I'm doing anything alone I one shot it, when I have even just another person I pull out an explosive .44 Pistol and shoot the ground so it takes as little damage as possible.
---
You cant corner a market on any server
---
With how easy ammo is to produce, and especially with the new exploit you wont corner the ammo market at all. Not even mentioning people can just server hop
---
I've got a Bloodied SS, Barbed-wire wrapped Baseball bat named "Lucille"
---
Jason can basically one-shot everything with his arsenal of weapons. I'm working on Power Armor for his "Uber Jason" form from Jason X
---
Do you know if the solar armor lags the game out like strangler heart? Or is that just a byproduct of the acid damage of the strangler heart?
---
I'd be okay with PA getting shafted on everything if they at least let us keep our backpacks on. Yes, we get calibrated shocks, but we gave up legendary effects for it. Hell, if nothing else let us slap the backpack mods into the torso or something.

They're not at risk of going under. I'm sure they'll re-re-release Skyrim on next gen with a few visual improvements. 76 Has a dedicated fanbase and while I got bored of the game shortly after release, I appreciate and understand why a lot of people enjoy that game. It's got to a point now where the glitches and bugs aren't funny, endearing or cute anymore. They need to be more responsible and respect their fans instead of allowing the same old shit to keep happening. I used to like Bethesda but seeing the same old problems on a relatively new release makes me think that they really don't care about quality. From their inaction, and their various commercial faux pas (including their numerous controversies) it appears that they're only interested in the contents of your wallet.
---
It's a shame because I genuinely think that Fallout 76 has one of the best worlds that Bethesda have made. It has the variety of biomes that Skyrim has along with the post nuclear Americana that we've loved from modern Fallout. I know that 76 was their experiment but Zenimax already has a subsidiary that has a popular MMO and we don't often hear controversies from that side. 
---
I'm just incredibly disappointed with Bethesda and I hope their next big release will assuage the doubt I have with them.
---
Only decent one is the lmg. That’s a magic weapon if you can keep your frame rate at 60 FPS or above and should do a ton of dmg until Bethesda patches that issue. Even after that, it will be worth around 3k caps to someone.
---
So, whenever you have sex with a girl you're exploiting her? Or taking advantage of? I see 3 entries for the word "exploitation" in the Oxford Dictionary: 
---
* The action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work.
---
* The action of making use of and benefiting from resources 
---
* The fact of making use of a situation to gain unfair advantage for oneself.
---
Let's call this a 'cheat' then, the ToS covers those as well. Does cheating not exist in any games, because the inherent capability of cheating is there, so it's all fair game?
---
I’m finding that it does get me to try things I wouldn’t normally. Like the Vats critical hits challenge. I don’t usually use vats but I’m starting to see the advantages.
---
If your level 36, don’t build in the cranberry bog
---
Yeah it depends on the event. I certainly don’t do this at the Queen or Encrypted. It’s tough because I don’t want to hog the legendary but I also don’t want to die. If I can pass the aggro on to someone else I will, you betcha I got my tag in already lol
---
I NEVER went melee route in these games. This is my first melee-focused character, and since I know the ins and outs of Bloodied builds, it makes the character a super serial killer. Serendipity is also fantastic as I can walk slowing towards a Scorched shooting at me, taking no damage and just one-shot him with a machete.
---
With the new glitch ammo should be 2 rounds to 1c now. I ran 21 ammo factory machines at the factory doing 5.56, if you chain them it speeds up production  I was getting 200 a minute or so.   
---
I do not advise using this method, as it is or should be considered an exploit, though there is no trick to do it and you are just using the tools they gave you, the machine itself should not be buildable by you.   
---
This has been reported, it is not hard to reproduce but honestly you would be ultimately wasting your time.   
---
PS no I will not tell you what or how to duplicate the machine, figure it out for yourself.
---
that was fixed a while ago. but no, it never did. it was specific to the acid from SH.
---
This is where I learned about weapons and builds.  At level 365 I still learn a lot from guys like Angry Turtle he is good one among many informative YouTube videos on F/O76..
---
Not durability unfortunately, it affects the condition only.
---
That sounds like upper development isn't actually managing pull requests properly. Idk if they have their own terminology for it, but those that have ever used github will understand. I've done basic flow diagrams for development branching, and pulling changes to a test branch and actually running it will show issues. What this guy is saying is they don't even have a test branch and some dev randomly pulls everything regardless of checking or communicating with other devs. That sounds highly unlikely.
---
For those that don't know, **pushing** changes means an individual dev submits their work to a specified branch. **Pulling changes** means a higher level dev checks for conflicts with merge issues and pulls all work from each dev.
---
Before pulling, it is standard practice to check which code is new and which code is old. If there are any questions as to version dates, it is also standard procedure to question the individual that worked on their part.
---
Fastest way to grind in white spring is to get the Chinese stealth armor(lvl30) and creep around doing headshots on ghouls with a silenced weapon. You get the suit from the main quest on the foundation side.
---
Here’s how we fix this. Don’t buy any other titles from Bethesda. If we, as a Fallout community, only put money into Fallout 76 and stop putting money into other Bethesda projects, they’ll be forced to allocate resources to where their revenue is coming from. 
---
However, if something is broken in the game, we should make sure others know about it and everyone ask for a refund for that particular product. The only way a company like Bethesda will change its behavior towards quality control is if it affects their profit margin.
---
I’ll drink to that, we power armor user do need a buff really. Even if My power armor I have 500+ carry weight, I’m sure unyielding builds probably have a lot more
---
Conveniently I nicknamed myself Mini Nuke.  Short, heavy, and mostly useless but when i go off it's all flash with little effect.
---
PA also gets a hidden damage reduction bonus, the best type of defense in the game.
---
Hello, i make all the steps:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hyqlbu/disconnected\_from\_server\_fallout\_76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hyqlbu/disconnected_from_server_fallout_76/)  , reduce the problem, but not ended.
---
Some good spots in the savage devide on the western side of the mountain range in the norther part of the savage divide. There is one next to a pond i have found up there with a purifier as a world spawn. Nearby is a larger open area next to a trailer, inside it has a pa spawn as well.
---
Also did you know that you can jump of a high ground fire a your weapon just before you hit the ground, the game give you no fall damage.
---
You can stay underwater forever of you keep changing your armor when you are about to run out of breath.
---
Texture seem to be badly rendered around a legendary enemy
---
Enemy no damage glitch is still going on, I couldn't kill a level 2 scorched with a level 30 weapon while being level 45.
---
The game can sometime and idk if they have fixed it but spawn your base merged into someone else's base, happened 4 days ago!
---
I always find the plans in watoga shopping plaza vendor and watoga train station vendor.
---
Nope. It affects the condition, not the durability. Luck for items found in the wild, **Intelligence** for crafted items.
---
the people that do this aren't on reddit, sorry to say
---
By the way, you're intended to equip and *throw* the fireworks mine.
---
Just jump back in and grab it
---
it doesn’t matter how much bethesda is worth or how much as a company they bring in.
---
what matters is how much FO76 is bringing in.  If the higher ups don’t think it’s bringing in enough money, they will shut it down. Why budget money to this game if they can shift it and get more?
---
I’m completely blaming bethesda, but i don’t expect changes because this game failed, despite its dedicated fan base (that even they are getting worn down)
---
Whoops I meant tier 73 (im 77 now) I’m level 296, yeah i want 300 for the legendary perks as well. I didn’t think about not opening my perk cards just because of the way you cash them in for points so it shouldn’t be a problem unless they make some changes.
---
Because a 4 year old missing a pinky finger did the math.
---
Consider getting yourself the Marsupial Mutation as it will allow you to jump on surfaces that are out of reach of the ghouls charred grabby hands
---
Rare outfits with .02% chance from events
---
I checked, it wasnt there
---
Yeah I have a 412 main and people keep dropping me stuff on my 75 pure bloodied stealth commando, the profile I made cause I need NOTHING at this point. Not sure if it's kindness or getting unencumbered especially when the gift is 30 bulk steel screws and lead, I feel horrible taking junk. When I get back on my main after those gifts I'm in a great mood and star dropping gifts to everyone else I meet. I never felt burnt giving a gift in this game
---
Brilliant.
---
Don't sell old or outdated weapons and armor. Instead take them to a work bench and deconstruct them so that you can potentially learn new mods for that weapon/armor.
---
Got a problem. Put in a ticket. Going on here to bitch ain't going to do nothing.
---
 maybe I'm not as concerned with it because I'm usually at Max caps but just be glad they have made some lifestyle improvements because before you used to have to travel to seven different merchants to get your 1400 cap limit
---
Your number one perk for white springs will be blocker in STR, 45% less dmg from enemy melee attacks. That should really help with ghouls as they swarm. Try to pull them out to places you can get high ground, or keep them in front of you and where only one or two can swing at you.
---
Are you on pc? I think I saw you or someone with the name like this xD
---
You probably suck at fallout
---
You need to know the location and pick up the data yourself, but if you have access to the Enclave bunker, getting the data every day is easy.  The room with a ton of desks in the military wing on the way to the Command area.  Search the desks.  On any given day, I've yet to \*not\* find a Technical Data.  And I think it refreshes more often than daily quests (not yet confirmed).
---
I think it depends on the size of the DLC. Wild Appalachia (which added Pioneer Scouts, Sheepsquatch, and Nukashine quests) had zero achievements added.
---
I’ve made some ‘enemies’ over time and occasionally get downvoted by them ‘just because’.
---
Add in some people come through and downvote everything ‘for the lulz’ and it happens sometimes. 
---
No worries. All I care about is helping people with good information.
---
Do you have lifegiver, fireproof, and/or adamantiun? pretty helpful alternatives if your concern is the end points. If your junkie already has all the dmg % blocker skills you should be pretty tanky even with a bit lower hp. Assuming you probably have chem fiend maxed.  Ghoulish can be pretty helpful when you’re in high rad zones. Just need to focus on radaway, unless your junkie is also a pa build then I guess that would be useless.
---
Iv chased random players down trying to give then things before it didnt matter the gender tho
---
Watch this group of BOS turn into the Enclave- Plot Twist
---
Then they've only got themselves to blame. I don't think it's entitled to want a quality product. Hell, I blame 76 for bricking a perfectly good 1TB external hard drive. Literally as soon as it was downloaded to that thing, the game crashed and my hard drive stopped working. It might not be the culprit but I personally believe that game ruined my hard drive. It not longer works no matter what I attempt.
---
Bethesda really need to get their act together and produce something with a tonne of polish because we can't continue to give them the benefit. We can't keep literally repairing their own games for them with custom mods etc. They need to be responsible and I think that's a fair statement.
---
LMAO THIS SHIT IS SUCH A JOKE
---
Synth detected.
---
This or why not just drop the limit and track the items that are shredded with the account id shredding it.  This way Bethesda could build a bot to audit the list and see if players are breaking down duplicates and then ban those accounts for taking advantage of the system.
---
We know. There’s been multiple posts a day about it
---
Seems good on paper but it’s not so great in practice, like capitalism ;)
---
Well, I suppose communism sounds good but requires no selfish assholes to work, so it will never be functional outside extremely small groups; pure capitalism sounds terrible to anyone with a brain, but fortunately has never been attempted without at least cursory socialist elements reigning it in. I mean, if we progressed more to the capitalist side then we’d have companies selling broken, untested products and government services dictated by for-profit interests, saying things like people need to put public health at risk for the sake of the stock market and... oh... I’ll let myself out...
---
You don't need a meta build, but you do need a proper SPECIAL and Perk loadout and half-decent gear with SOME Legendary attributes
---
Unless something has changed, the only bulked items that actually give you a weight benefit are aluminum and lead. All others are net zero or actually weigh more bulked in the stash.
---
Well said
---
They were going to come out, but after backlash they said they're going to work on them more before releasing them
---
I'm a genuine, just starting, lvl 18 character and it happens to me as well. Big thank you guys.
---
I main 1H on my Bloodied Melee, with Power Attacks and buffs I can do 1500 to the SBQ's head with a machete. Also, if you're going Stealth and add the Stealth Mod to your knives you can get a crazy amount of stealth damage through sneak modifiers
---
Happens alot with my Automatic Handmade.
---
Yes so far i’ve only found pipe weapons and machetes didn’t even go to the first main quest objective (that wayward shop I guess) iam still exploring lol and build my first extended barrel for hunting rifle
---
We do, but this is at the cost of not being able to swim, requiring a fusion core, losing out on the use of several perks, and losing use of up to 15 simultaneous legendary effects
---
I may have done this last night during Radiation Rumble - I've only done that one a few times, and this wave of ghouls came - just... so many of them. As I was taking them out, I was realizing that some of them were legendaries. I think I popped off on one or two before I started "holding back" - but it was difficult to hold back but still keep killing everyone else, especially with gun-fu going all over the place.
---
They have not been released yet. Currently in the public test server.
---
Literally just go into the base color parameter and make it black. 500 atoms. The micro transactions in this game are fucking awful.
---
I was walking around at level 5 with a hunters long coat, forest scout mask and low level explosive weapons and people were trying to give me things.
---
Thanks for replying! Damn, that blows. What was the backlash about? I thought the one for +50% ammo production looked great.
---
I run an ammo vendor. 1c per round. 2c for ultracite. 10c for fusion/plasma cores. I turn on my machine when my caps get low, I turn it off at the end of that session until I need more caps a week or so later usually. I tend to run at least 30-40k items of ammo at any one time. Looking forward to legendary perks and hopefully make 100’s of k’s of stock.
---
Never released. Will be released sometime after patch  21
---
The one OP is talking about is worth 200. It's not a god roll. If they actually wiped the dupers then the prices would still be crazy. Do you think that was a accident?  They were selling on Ebay for hundreds in real cash. Now they aren't. That's just facts. The market is now flooded.
---
Using a Stealthboy helped me complete many quests when high-level enemies were around.
---
Both my characters are Bloodied. I don't play between xx:45 and xx:05 when the reset happens (either by availability or choice) and I have never had a single auto-complete
---
I’m curious why you get so many immediate disconnects
---
Nice brow, awesome photos. The spawn rate is in 25% of the attempts? Or more?
---
It's the condition that's reliant on Luck, for items found in the wild. Intelligence for crafted items.
---
Not out yet, but you can see "Perk Coins" listed under "Collections" in your Pip-Boy
---
I use fireproof at rank 2 which is all you need and tried adamantium skeleton but its not worth 3 points when Im barely ever getting crippled more than once every few hours. The only perk Id think about subbing in would be lifegiver but then again my setup right now isnt an issue on the defensive. My guy barely gets scratched, &gt;&gt;&gt;its the damage that's not up to par even though ive taken everything that boosts full health damage&lt;&lt;&lt;
---
Lucky hole mine will give you at least 1k lead for 5 minutes mining with the right gear and perks.
---
I run bloodied and no issues.  Before this bug I had same issue with being logged into NW on reset.  
---
Always log out now before in both modes
---
I have it happen on a non-bloodied character when logging in an hour after the reset. So no dont think so ;)
---
I hunt pepper like a hawk now.
---
Pepper is used to make pepperoni roll food - plus 30 to carry weight.
---
That.. sounds MORE cringy somehow.  Maybe we just drop that whole line goin forward
---
What's wrong with the RR garage door? Mine is working normal.
---
Crossplay would be so nice.
---
How I did it at level 10 was get the ghouls to chase me into the parking lot than die. When you respawn you can go in there ghoul free snag the sword and haul ass.
---
I’m like this as well unless you nuke my base well behind Drop Site V9 as a place to fight the queen; which people usually don’t nuke unless they want to be a dick. This happened couple times so i just one shotted the queen as soon as it spawns.
---
I got mine from the Charleston station vendor. But they don't have the same special stuff every day.
---
almost no one uses crafted items, though. and the bar on items I find is generally larger if I have my unyielding gear on or just high luck, really.
---
What do you mean “manage” a junkies build? There’s nothing to really manage, just get your 5 addictions and then you’re set
---
So when you toggled the "retrieve your lost items" or whatever it says, did it show a waypoint? I admit, I've never fallen into a fissure site, but I would think even if it's irretrievable, it would still show up wherever it's located
---
I think we all have alts and this is too close to the truth.  Surrelp just pay it forward, the gifts are great because you level so fast now.  The LR takes so much time to grind that you hardly have time to farm 🙂.  Just remember to pay it forward..
---
I'm on PC and been getting immediate disconnects every time I log on for the last couple of nights.
---
Which terminal? The only terminal I could find said it was locked until the security lockdown or whatever was over.
---
True. Would be fun to have some sort of achievement for dealing with a million scout challenges...
---
Happened to me again today too. That’s the 4th time, I’ve probably lost close to 10,000 points so far including the weeklies that kept showing up as completed although I hadn’t done them.
---
Can confirm i happened to be logged in during the reset though, playing NW. 
---
It’s pretty discouraging.
---
You are able to what you do is remove the favorite tag from stims then favorite whatever healing you want and then open the favorites wheel and you’re able to reassign it to whatever the stim was.
---
My stash is chock full of useless 3*'s that I can fucking get rid of because of the scrip daily limit..its infuriating to me that my gameplay sessions consist mostly of "Can I even carry this much shit"
---
It’s unnecessary. It’s just something else to do really. Nothing in this game is that hard to where you have to dedicate a build. It’s more for fun than function.
---
+1 for kiting haha
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted for this. It's true.
---
Cool story.
---
RF_huntr is obviously 100% on point here but can I just say kudos to you for including "something I did to cause this." Most of the time it’s just "BUGTHESDA lolololol no code good"
---
Personally, I won't pay more than 1 cap for any ammo, but someone might if they need to for a cap sink, maybe?
---
My one shots are on accident. I like to share the spoils. However during uranium fever i saw the "follow me" - I looked over and saw the miner on the verge of death so I blasted it with my caster really quick. 
---
Didn't think it was a big deal cause there were 5 of them surrounding it.
---
Apparently it was an issue cause one of those 5 wouldn't stop shooting me in pacifist for the rest of the event.
---
That one was added after the backlash
---
As a low level 26 player who, despite playing fallout 4 for years as a filthy casual, was extremely confused and lost after leaving the vault; generous high level players have been a godsend. It’s not even the loot gifts, it’s the advice and the occasional couple of hours of laughs over an Xbox party that I’m most grateful for. I’ve only been playing a week, but I love this community so much that after years of reading reddit under a guest account; I finally made my own account just so I could participate. 
---
Honestly this whole community just feels like one big happy family. This game wouldn’t be worth playing otherwise.
---
Ive noticed that the combination of power user and having a bunch of randomly charged fusion cores sends me gatling lasers brain into struggle mode
---
Because 1 point is OCD level and not an actual problem let alone one worth mentioning, like, say, the game fucking crashing or SCORE auto-completing?
---
Getting to level 300 in time for legendary perks, Reputation, Base Building, and collecting rare items/plans. If done w/ all that, just wait till Brotherhood
---
People like to downvote the truth if it's even slightly less productive than what was already suggested.
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for the reply. Hopefully they roll them out soon!
---
Should be able to pay him to insult a specific person on the server.
---
How do you get perk coins? I can't find the option to scrap my cards.
---
Whitesprings at level 35?! Godspeed, little buddy.
---
I hope you get your dragon back. It's awesome just for the reloading animation
---
If you’re doing full health vampires is by far the best prefix for any gun because it helps keep your health up as often as possible. A vampires limb damage weapon would be very powerful due to it being magical and allowing you to pump out damage competitive to bloodied ones.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
100 legendary run while in holding pattern for BOS update.
---
By default the hotkey will use the "lowest power" healing item in this order: salves, diluted stim, regular stim, super stim. The only way to get it to default to super stims is to drop or sell everything else. I've never used diffusers other than the 3 I needed to use for the badge, but they might be higher on the list (if they even work).
---
Geez, what you using to one-shoot the queen?
---
yOu SaVeD tHe DaY
---
ok? you can test it yourself. start a new character and keep killing scorched for their guns. only level luck. the bar is gonna get progressively (and noticeably) larger the higher your luck.
---
I did this ages ago on a mule. was only leveling luck. at one point I started getting max durability gear only, until they started dropping higher level ones.
---
then I upped my luck some more and the same thing happened.
---
The cliff in the mire is the only place I've had it work correctly.
---
As someone who’s worked in software delivery for a few decades, it’s easier said then done, and I’ve not worked on something as complicated as a full size game that supports third party code mods. 
---
I would bet my life they test, but it just doesn’t make reasonable sense to test every single thing against every single mod and every modal you can build. It would only take 10 mins to find that if you happen to be testing the specific skin and mod combinations you are using, which is likely one of millions of combinations. 
---
You won’t like this answer, many of you will downvote it, but it’s the truth. I’m not saying they get a pass, the games got issues, but it’s not as simple as just test it all and make it work right.  You’ve got to prioritize what you fix, and in some cases, the bug you hit might only impact 2% of users, so they are going to prioritize more impactful bugs in the likely small time they give to bug fixing.
---
I normally don't. I haven't been using my bloody character lately and I was kind of tying the dc and autocomplete to them.
---
On ps4 btw.
---
I've had several melee builds do it in UF.
---
This has been a (wonderful) thing for forever.
---
Best is when you know you have 2k rounds and you go to reload and it tells you you don't have the ammo to reload said gun 🤬
---
Fallout 76 is a Vault Tec experiment on us.
---
Hmm... so if I’m 115...?
---
We've been doing that for 2 years now and we still have major bugs that have existed since launch. There isn't much else we can do.
---
You sound like a commie.
---
Since she all but ignores explosive damage legacy weapons arnt great on her. Nothing with explosive is. Your best bet is a b or j ffr lmg.
---
Also stealth doesn't work on her unless you are soloing her. So I believe heavys out dps commandos on the Queen. Though I am not 100% on that
---
You're definitely onto something.
---
The rifle looks rusty as heck, which is good.
---
The only problem I see is that the clothes are too clean. Alot of cosplayers do this, they forget the clothes should be dirty and have rips / tears in them. 
---
Those Nuka break videos on youtube were the worst offenders of this. No one has clean clothes or freshly washed hair in the apocalypse.
---
She sounds perfect.
---
I think a lot of us go by scraping whatever is heaviest that we don’t want 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Oh I see you're asking for Enclave paint for other types of power armor. I don't know why people are downvoting you, that would be cool.
---
Yeah, that's happened to me too.
---
Did just for the ghillie
---
I'm on PC and my Bethesda username is similar.
---
Diffusers aren't included on this list unfortunately, which is one of the problems. Super Stimpaks are useable this way like you said, as it was apparently patched in fairly recently, but still can't be used from the Stats tab of the Pipboy.
---
Surely you should be able to reverse the priority of the aforementioned list as a bare minimum.
---
I play a junkies character. Once I was online during reset time. Bam, I got hit by the bug. That was the only time.
---
I don’t disagree. I have no plans to buy future online games from them.
---
Offline games will be evaluated on their own merit
---
It used to be a bit bigger. Looked better in my opinion, now it seems off for some reason
---
I didn't know this. Guess I'll finally give in and get that mutation then.
---
I also have 100% the trophies on PS4. And I would love that they would add more trophies/achievements in their updates.
---
How much do spices go for ? So i start getting some to sell, never thought it was something people wanted.
---
Are you alright in the head?
---
do you make the "jason noise" in the mic when other players are nearby?
---
phonetically it's awkward to write, "ch ch ch ah ah ah" or something
---
Is the shielded lining mod available at the vault 79 shop or somewhere else? I cant seem to find it.
---
Same. I really hope Starfield is actually something special and this is coming from a someone who used to be the biggest Bethesda apologist.
---
I don’t run bloodied and it has happened to me multiple times. 🥺
---
None of the likely theories apply to me, but it hit me once last week.
---
No its actually super simple to develop content with the creation engine. They're just really, really bad at anything that isn't world space or NPC face morphs.
---
PA fanny packs are go...
---
(bethesda makes them purely cosmetic)
---
Yes and no as you also lose out on Serendipity.  Although a reliable damage reduction is generally better, the gap is not all that great.
---
You are right on track
---
Edit: if you’ve already crushed through your weeklies you could be in trouble though.
---
I'd be fine with it.   She never drops anything great anyway.   For me, it's all about the flux.
---
Why don't *you* test it and send me a nice video?
---
(melt intensifies)
---
As a depressed redditor, you should have plenty of experience with this analogy.
---
Yeah, I learned that. I was under the impressions, that I needed to keep getting chems regularly.
---
Ok i kill her as quickly as possible while others wait somewhere outside RAD zone
---
if ever you’re worried about a rick roll just look for the double Q. If they hyperlink it, well then good luck lol
---
I mean, as a bloodied build, I can just stand around while a bunch of scorched whack at me if I'm wearing PA.
---
but even with a full sentinel set, a small group of liberators managed to kill me within a few seconds.
---
Other than a few specific weapons, vats no longer causes damage in PvP. Some have said that the railway rifle and gamma gun still work with vats but I can’t confirm this.
---
I scrip by weight. No way do I want to be stuck with a few one star  broadsiders or mini guns.
---
I pretty much only run bloody, and I've only had this happen once.
---
The monorail elevator is easily one of my favorite locations it has some of the best skeleton story telling in the game in my opinion
---
What to do when I accidentally shoot a turret on someone’s workshop while attempting to defend that workshop?
---
Are you fucking stupid?
---
PA? And those actually sound pretty good. I'll have to scout them out later tonight. Thank you
---
as far as i know the one that will be your enemy in the upcoming event will have a percentage based damage reduction (similar to the SBQ)
---
the colossi/colossusses/colossusss (im really sorry) 
---
,that you encounter in nukezones should be significantly less tanky then the event one
---
it WAS the crashed space station... then new neighbors moved in. now that place is a generic raider hub and it sucks.
---
Plus when they brought out t65 they nerfed at damage resist of all the other ones. Go look up old stats on X01 and Ultracite and then see what you're getting now.
---
The whiffle bat works :D can confirm 🤣👍
---
The whales downvote because they successfully purchased the item and will never bother to craft one.
---
I do like the savage divide, it pretty nice and clean and decent
---
Yep same here but all over the map once in a while
---
As long as you’re ahead of the green space ship (or within a couple of spaces) you’re good.
---

This was made before the extra 2 dailys though so it'll be a bit off
---
follow the overseers quest line.  It will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.
---
This game is a marathon, not a sprint.  Take your time and enjoy the scenery.  Learn the lore.  
---
Stay in the Forest area (Green, west side of map) until you are close to L20.  Lots of questlines to start. goto riverside manor (mysteries quest), camp mcclintock (recruitment blues, Charleston - firebreathers).  I forget where the responders questline starts.
---
Around 20, move north to the big alligator. (toxic valley)  
---
around 30, go to the ash heap (dark area to the south)  Start Miner Miracles
---
at 40, head to the center strip of the map (savage divide)
---
at 45, the mire (top right)
---
at 50+, the Bog (lower right, reddish)
---
If you find your enemies are much higher levels than you, you have drifted outside the designated areas.
---
The old guides are mostly valid, and they will help you on the (still existing) original questline.
---
No I've still got most of my weekly challenges I've only completed 2 of them
---
Okay. Hopefully it is, just wanted to make sure is a little bit more challenging than this one.
---
Nuke mines don't work anymore and you can't start pvp with people on your team and if you don't like pvp you can turn pacifist on
---
Dont be...
---
I bought from a random team mate's offline vendor a jffrfr gatling plasma for 5k... it worths more than 20×...
---
Imagine everyone in the server sending one to one person hahahah
---
well i only ever thought one colossus and i felt it was a decent experience but for an endgame boss i do agree, it should be a challenge
---
You're really lucky. He needed to verify install integrity, because the updater is broken (at least for me). Every patch introduces nonsense like this or flat out refuses to launch until I verify the install.
---
All my characters are bloody builds “knocks on wood” haven’t lost any yet
---
I just recently learned this as well. And that with maxed Class Freak the negatives while solo are completely negated. Literally no downside as long as your running Class Freak.
---
Dude. It can't be done sorry. I get almost of my caps from selling ammo. I have a route I go for materials. Then make crap loads. Think I have 25k of each type in inventory, and 5k in vendors for sale at any giving time. It's so easy to make when you know how to do it.
---
You can trust levels. Some people cheated the system, some people have multiple characters and accounts.
---
For example, my main is level 188. I have secondary characters at levels 54, 122, 120 and 161 if my memory is fine. They started as mules, and now they all exist at the same time. Really different builds and personalities, they allow me to do different things. 
---
But I have deleted seven or eight level 100 characters. I have over 2000 hours in and have been playing since release.
---
Something like this should have been 150 or 200 at most. It's just so underwhelming for 300 atoms.
---
No, that’s what makes junkies good. You get a lot of bonus damage and as long as you don’t take addictol you don’t really need to do anything
---
Exactly this. So far as I understand it, to maximize things, you'd need to be signing in *every* 20 hours, meaning every day, you'd need to sign in four hours earlier than you did the day before... which just *is not* practical.
---
I thought the reload was a feature of the handmade, that because it is handmade that the clip won't empty a lot of times. It doesn't happen to any other weapons for me.
---
Can't*
---
Heart of the swamp last night.
---
i hate when people do that they run up with their OP ass guns and just spray them dead and take all the loot
---
I made my house almost entirely accessible but for roleplaying locked the door to my “bedroom”. God Damn Beckett keeps opening it to walk around. Which he does not have to do to get anywhere else. Reminds me of trying to have a personal house in fallout 4. Always find someone in your bed.
---
Bethesda knows what customers want.  Disparate currency types with arbitrary time limits set for each.
---
The longer this game goes without mods, the bigger the unofficial patch will be.
---
You can't yet, just pointing out that it's listed there.
---
Or just remove the daily limit. It's dumb as fuck.
---
I turn off all the static-y ones
---
How would they remove them? They were never even added
---
Actually. Would you like to be apart of my scouting/building crew? I need all hands on deck
---
I run a 9INT anyway and try to join build teams. I’m a junkies so I lose some to that. 
---
Thanks for the positivity! 👍🏻
---
I’ve noticed (on PS4), that if an enemy isn’t wearing any clothes, is missing their head, and/or they don’t move, that’s a sign they didn’t load in correctly and are unkillable.
---
I have played it over my mic before actually but it's a little bit of a pain to do.
---
Yup. They absolutely make new characters for each playtest. There's just no way they actually play the game.
---
So many of the bugs I am able to work around fairly easily, and some of the shortcomings can be made up by mods (as with most Bethesda games). Like I know people who still lose their shit when they can't get a robot vendor to open up without looking away first... there comes a point where people need to just work around these minor inconveniences instead of, for example, slamming R until they wear out their keyboard, expecting something they know is intermittently broken to work first try.
---
But some of the big bugs, like when all of my daily and weekly quests auto-completed last week, or the atoms from challenges not working, or the constant dupe methods that go unpatched, or the releasing of broken items/weapons/atomic shop swag, is just a product of not enough testing  and the game being built on an old single-player engine. Patience goes a long way when it comes to these larger bugs.
---
However, I still very much enjoy playing despite all the bugs and glitches. I haven't even approached the point where I've felt the bugs and occasional aggravation outweigh the good times and fun I'm having with my friends and family while playing.
---
I'm hoping that with the PTS getting constant updates that bugs and glitches in new content will slowly stop being so prominent, now that the community is involved with testing. Regardless of how anyone feels about Bethesda offloading some of the testing responsibility to its players, there are lots of games that do this and it is almost never a bad thing. The additional input and feedback the community gets into the development of new features and experiences now will hopefully prove valuable moving forward to the overall stability and player experience in the game.
---
I’ve played since beta, have thousands of hours in and never played nw. I have no interest in it
---
Morgantown. I hate not being allowed to build my camp using some of those rooftops.
---
The unofficial fix wouldn't do anything. Everything would need to be fixed on the server side. Unless we'd have actual private servers hosted by individuals.
---
They just nerfed VATS completely? Its no wonder I was wasting so many bullets.
---
I was with someone for 8 years who spent 5 years in an abusive relationship. The game doesn't beat me or call me a slut, whore, and cut me off from family.
---
I don't fear leaving the game because I think it's going to stalk and kill me some day.
---
It's just a game. Some people are so jaded over it they can't possibly fathom anyone having fun with it. Regardless for 40 bucks I got over 300 hours of entertainment out of it and a ton of cool screen shots.
---
Is it buggy? Fuck yes, but I mean I knew what I was walking into. I know what company this is.
---
I sold a bloodied one to someone the other day. So maybe at least one user unless he just wanted to resell it
---
I find individual Gods, and very occasionally two or three, at semi-regular intervals and although its improved it has been a bug for a very long time - I had one in the very first hour of my very first character a long, long time ago. You soon get used to it and learn to ignore them but just occasionally they occur but you don't realise quickly immediately and spend valuable time and ammo.
---
Bailey's family Cabin always reminds me of some of those old horror movies, (i.e. evil dead)
---
catch some fog or a rad storm, the photos might be interesting
---
Can you one shot a legendary?  It seems they have to mutate before they would die.  I see the point, if someone does it this means they just don't care, or read the constant posts on Reddit which as you to stop and be a team player.
---
Except we have these things releasing with glaring bugs that you can see in like 5 minutes or less of casual use. Especially glaring things like fucked up UV maps such as the Blood Eagle skin suppressor.
---
At that point its clear they just flat out dont test shit at all these days.
---
Welcome to the club
---
You can overscript just on your total not the daily.
---
No problem at all bud!
---
Are you a Jerk? Hell no! I have been playing since beta and have had my share of jerks trying to instigate whatever with me. It happens more often when I have been at lower levels especially with a lower level attacking me and a higher level hiding close by to one-shot me.
---
I usually ignore them or switch servers. And I always make sure they get nothing from me regardless of the outcome. I assume that most of them are just goofy kids that haven't yet learned how real people are expected to treat each other.
---
Of course, there is also the probability that they are damaged human beings that will always go out of their way to hurt others as revenge for having been born. Hopefully, they will confine their destructive behavior to electronic games where no one actually gets hurt.
---
I got so lucky. As I was there a high level person came in, saw me struggling, destroyed every ghoul with some godly weapon she had, and then dropped me a bunch of weapons and armor. This community never ceases to amaze me. I wish I could’ve given back but alas, I have nothing she would want lmfaooo
---
Vault 76
---
I'm almost 100% sure stealth does still work on the Queen. I play solo on public servers and can see the difference in the damage numbers when I'm in "Caution" as apposed to "Danger".
---
I have heard that if you're on a team and one of your team mates is in "Danger" (or not stealthed) then it doesn't work for you. Not sure if that applies to public teams.
---
They should make it a statue of Todd Howard bending over and then make the ‘use’ animation planting a big wet kiss on his ass.
---
Yeah I scrapped the door till they fix it. Honestly I like it better coming back to it being open every time. I wish this door was like others where it only closes when unpowered.
---
I've got a J/FFR LMG on my junkie's heavy weapons guy. I'd test it, but I don't have sufficient ammo.
---
i feel like with u thats not the case the way u sound u pop in stealing everyones kills and just call everyone bad
---
It's because SFE is coded to only work on a specific patch as a safety net and to avoid potential spamming on the mod thread.
---
If you're lucky and have access to the unlocked version, you'll see that not updating it doesn't cause problems.
---
It’s safe to assume everyone on the internet is a dude until proven otherwise. Never trust an avatar. That said, I definitely see a high number of girly gamer tags in FO76.
---
I think Radiation Rumble is way too intense to worry about sharing legendaries.   I've seen it fail way too often because all the scavengers die.   And everyone I've talked to always walks away with a boatload of legendaries anyway, even with everyone killing everything as madly as they can.  (I've never seen anyone just try to cripple them, which is too bad.)   So maybe someone gets 5 instead of 7 or whatever--not a big deal in my book.
---
There will be more bonuses before it's over. Keep after it and you'll be fine.
---
The assaultron is attacking you because sometime recently, you (intentionally or accidentally) struck a robot.  It will pass.  But you have learned a lesson - hit one robot, and they will \*all\* attack you.  (Whitesprings is one of the few places where robots are friendly.)
---
The problem for you at WS is it is a popular high level area, and the enemies will scale to the higher level players.
---
If you hit it right, the ghouls will be between L9 and 22, adn your life will be much easier.
---
Your alternative is to team up with a higher level player to 'guard' while you do what you need to do to get the sword.  But if you are teamed with a high level, the enemies will be high level.
---
Power armor and a vampire or ghoul slayers weapon will help you.
---
I figured if it was a bug I would have seen somebody else complain about it
---
Best part? Timer said. Ending in 23 hours 23 minutes
---
I touched once for the double xp weekend just so I could get a few camp items. Other then that I avoid it like the plague.
---
Rubberbanding health bug.
---
Were you using an explosive or tesla weapon?
---
My personal experience was that if I use an explosive legendary effect or telsa weapon, and hit too many mobs in a short timeframe, the bug kicks in.
---
I'm then forced to melee my way to safety, as melee still works, and then server hop to clear the bug.
---
After level 50, if you have all the perks in place, the serums and the gear, technically you are no different than a lvl 500.
---
And a lvl 500 who didn't figure out his build or is lacking equipment is no better than a lvl 50.
---
What you saw there is probably a hacked, legacy or magic weapon. Anyone can trade for one these days.
---
I can do good damage on her with my bloodied commando, maybe 100-300 per headshot when she lands. 
---
But heavies, well, you can't go wrong with a laser or plasma Gatling. Remember: damage comes from the build, not the weapon. A bloodied melee with a lead pipe can cause more damage than most weapons.
---
Nope just a straight up b25 50cal
---
I still think we should be able to scrap legendaries....
---
No when all I'm doing to get my score and gold script is daily events, it's really nice watching people teleport there afk in circles at events, you sound like one of those people.
---
From what I have seen in videos of test server attempts and what I've read not only is his health and armor much much higher than a standard colossus (much how even a 3 star level 80 scorchbeast is much much weaker than the SBQ) his adds are also tougher and spawn more frequently.  He also looked like he feared a lot more than the normal colossus.  They are still tweaking the event though so what we actually get in live may be a lot different. 🤷‍♂️
---
I bought some 50 cal for 2 caps each last night. Exactly 3 of them to complete the daily.  Was still cheaper than hopping to another vendor.  Enjoy your 6 caps whoever you are!!!
---
I've come to the conclusion that Bethesda games are best when they are not made by Bethesda.
---
There's a fridge thing that usually has some beside the mama dolches main door
---
Legacy’s work in vats still
---
I'm happier when I assume I won't get them.   Even when I motion people over for the first one, they usually won't return the courtesy on #2 and 3.   I skipped UF today, for maybe the first time ever.
---
Also fair, sorry to hear about your past. Hope life is treating you better.
---
then the items will be max level for whatever weapon rolls..
---
It's because they have autism and are terrified of interacting with "griefers" (other players).
---
Yeah, right now that weapon should devastate due to the magic effect but should still put out excellent damage assuming it gets fixed.
---
Does vats for PVP work with the handmade and fixer?
---
If I can make it out alive lol! I’m level 29!
---
I’ve never shot the robots thankfully, but what I meant was the ghouls all seem to look right past them and come to me lmao. But, some high level just so happened to be there and absolutely saved my ass and helped me find the password for the computer. It almost brought a tear to my eye to be honest.
---
I’ll keep that in mind. The Mire creeps me out!
---
I'm partial to Abandoned Bog Town and Treetops.
---
*Todd forbid
---
As a bloodied heavy gun build, I would choose a bloodied gatling plasma.
---
At Foundation?
---
BFFR .50 cal used to be the king of DPS at the queen fights IIRC.
---
I always did well with a BFFR LMG though, but the reloads kill the DPS.
---
With power armor you might be better off doing a junkies build though, I don't know. I haven't compared the two myself because I rarely use power armor.
---
no im one of those people who arent kill stealing asshats i make sure everyone gets their share
---
Same here. So much joy
---
Dad bless you.
---
you need a system like at Alpine River Cabins
---
That's my question, which has been answered. Thanks for the reply!
---
I was actually annoyed reading this until I got to the end, you got me!
---
PTS is still as much of a grind as the base game.
---
- No debug chest to test new content
---
- No debug chest to test old content
---
- No ATX items enabled at all
---
- No debug level up tool
---
Those would be the *obvious* times, yes, but some of those things would be nice to have outside of just the holidays. Plus, they just had the Christmas electric fireplace back in the Shop.. last week, I think? Might even still be there?
---
Same with selling to vendors. If the vendor has 6 caps left and I have a combat knife that will sell for 7, I should be able to lose out on a cap if I want to
---
That is definitely the exception to the rule. If I hear that song playing I turn them off. Lol
---
Oh okay. So the systems in place already.
---
Couldn't agree more on this one.
---
Slightly related, anyone know where I can find a clean space suit helmet? 
---
Also, what category is the planetarium under?
---
Stealth works on her, but you have to keep distance from all the adds so they don't detect you. I keep some distance from all the other players who are drawing the adds and I stay in stealth and can see that my damage numbers reflect it. That's with a B2525 fixer, but I have high enough AGL that I can even stay stealthed for a short time with an LMG if I stay at a good distance from everything. The DPS with an LMG in stealth is just crazy.
---
it’s really only casual 5 mins in IF you are playing exactly like you are playing. If the tester is doing some free form exploratory testing they would have to load up the right map, and happen to have that particular weapon, with that particular skin equipped to run into it. 
---
You also have to consider even if they have the time and budget to test every single combination of maps and weapons and skins and find the bugs, they then have to dedicate the time to triage, find out what is causing the error, code a fix, and test again. 
---
Prior to each release, if it’s anything like other software development releases, there’s a decision point to decide if the known bugs that are not fixed must be fixed before release, shortly after, or potentially never. Fixing every bug might mean never getting to release. In nearly ever large project / thing I’ve worked on, codes been released with bugs that were deemed not to be blockers for release. Bug free releases don’t exist, doesn’t matter if it’s a game, reddit, your online banking platform, the Xbox operating system etc.
---
i just drop all armor legendaries (sometimes sell the good stuff but armor doesn't sell well these days). Drop all 1 star legendary weaps (unless they're decent) and scrip 2x 2 star legendary weaps and 3x 3 star legendary weaps every day. my stash is chock full of 3\* knives and 90% weight reduced trash weaps but after an hour or so i usually have enough in my inventory already anyway : / They really just need to ATLEAST double to scrip cap, 150 is 3 heckin legendary modules dude...
---
Wow that’s brutal. I rolled my first gauss mini gun yesterday, got a medics ffr limb damage. Not the worst! Definitely not nocturnal bad at least I can use mine lol seriously though I don’t understand why nocturnal is even a thing...like even if you go all out with a nocturnal build, get all the night time perks..you’re only viable at night time? And even worse than normal in the day time? Yeah I just don’t get it, and I don’t think a single player has ever even done a nocturnal build because of how ridiculous it is. Anyway, good luck on your next roll!
---
For me I'd like a medical doctor ally that gave out quests for like stims, radaways, etc
---
It's happens to me too, or the people glitching presents or anything else messed up about the half broken game, I just try to enjoy it as much as one can. Until they fix everything wrong with it, everyone has problems
---
Different people experience the shitiness on different days. If your logic was followed, there would be EXACTLY one post praising the game and one post criticizing the game.
---
I did it once and felt absolutely awful. The angry emotes coming at me stabbed me in my soul with disappointment in myself.
---
I can't imagine how people do that and are happy with it.
---
From anecdotal tales, people have been saying that it's the sever thinking you are doing unrealistic damage, possibly compounded by server lag, so the server is discarding the damage you are doing.
---
Once it kicks in, you're screwed and have to server hop to clear.
---
Basically, your OP and need to be nerfed.
---
Yeah, that was a pretty gross addition.  The monetization seems to have been nastier this year, probably an order from on high.
---
The cores get refilled to that random amount. You are actually getting free ammo.
---
Bethesda is obviously a shit company that doesn’t treat their devs well. 
---
They milk the same product endlessly (their shit engine) and expect the community to cover their sorry asses when they fuck up catastrophically (which they do). 
---
At this point it’s your fault. Skyrim infinity made it obvious. The launch of fo76 made it more obvious. 
---
I know it’s sad and they’ve got some great IP, but that’s all they have at this point.
---
Ricochet/Dodgy/Emergency protocols combine to make strong defence for bloodied PA
---
1200 hours and I went on the fist time last week.  I was fortunate to be teamed with a level 128 and I followed him around then up the mountain, we were the last of two teams and the 128 killed all the others for the win.  I have a win under my belt and will probably not go back unless there is an easy daily or weekly I have to check off.
---
Power armor spawn. Its inside the trailer if i remember correctly.
---
Because you have to get some damage in on an enemy to loot them.   If the other players don't get a chance to put in damage, they won't get anything from that enemy, including the legendary item.
---
That's a good idea, I should start doing this.
---
&gt; destroy crops
---
They can't do that unless she procs PVP. Try coming up with a believable story next time.
---
True. That would be great! So that everyone at the event can get their damage in at least for a reward at the end.
---
No, the one between the Freakshow and Lucky Hole Mine .
---
Ive built all ovwr the place. I would be more than willing to help if youre wanting some assistance
---
I run junkies I would have loved to trade it for something more useful but just got irritated at it because of course the first god roll I get would be untradeable
---
Story of my life 😂
---
the vox syringer does almost no damage and make the legendary glow purple
---
sadly this effect does not persist after death
---
Well its a good thing i play solo. Im the kind of person who freaks out and shoots at any enemies immediately.
---
welcome to reddit
---
Also hurts your energy weapon damage if you use energy and don’t suppress the mutation. Get an insulated backpack mod
---
You are just fine. Do some extra XP farmimg just in case of score losing bug.
---
That sucks that you found out about it AFTER buying it. Well hopefully they’ll fix it and we won’t have to worry about it anymore... but I realize that’s probably asking for too much :’)
---
LOL!   Solo is the way to go if you want to be sure to get all the legendaries, that's for sure.
---
Also it seems it would be a easy way to get achievement hunters to return to the game during updates :P
---
Shotguns make it easy
---
You can get the plans in one day of playing.
---
shotgun
---
No, because I've been almost exclusively using my bloodied main character through this whole thing and have yet to have the autocomplete happen once.
---
I have made sure to never be on at reset (I log out 5 minutes before and log back in 5 minutes after) and I never log right into nuclear winter (always log into adventure, quit to menu, then into nuclear winter), and when I exit the game at reset I also log out of my account in the launcher.
---
Really would love to know why some people have such a bad time with this while other people never have it happen.
---
Okay that was worth a chuckle
---
That’s crazy because I get the opposite effect lol I really think serendipity is all the difference. With no PA I seem to just not take damage running 3 uny and 2 bolstering, serendipity, and blocker. With PA it’s protocols, blocker and dodger yet i take damage all day and die way more. I don’t understand, maybe I’m doing something wrong. I would rather wear pa honestly but I die more in it and I don’t know why.
---
i recently got a hold of a junkies, limb, 90% weight reduced mr handy and it's probably my favourite weap to just run around and chop up stuff with. As a bonus it's very legendary sharing friendly, i always bust it out for events if there are other people there. Unless it's census violence and it's hordes of mr gutsies..... : /
---
id be ok with it every week.. easy peasy
---
I know I could do lucky hole mine but I’m close to max caps with just found amm0 and what I make from my resource collector.
---
I know, but the higher level can still deliberately go pvp.   See the post above about the 800 or 900-level player.   It's just that now they're doing it intentionally, not being dragged in against their will.
---
I am both thankful and surprised that it still has underwear on
---
In my experience, only shielded casual under armor can be applied to atomic shop under armor.   I bought the raider waster under armor and tried to put shielded raider under armor on it. I couldn't do it.  But on another character I had shielded casual under armor and was able to apply it.
---
In other words, shielded secret service under armor probably won't work but shielded casual under armor might.   But I can't say for certain. Do you have the shielded secret service armor plans?
---
Depending on build for most of the gear options. Sounds like PA-Shotgun, maybe junkie?
---
Anyway, yeah, aside from that, the T-65 is a pretty great all-round set. Farm tiles are very handy for, well, farming. Backpack mods are nice to avoid grinding badges for high capacity or what have you.
---
Honestly, after your main build gear? It’s all QoL or basically decorative pieces. If it sounds interesting, just go for it.
---
Sadly Xbox :( I’m a “game pass noob” as some have referred to us lol.. which is totally true I am certainly a noob and I use game pass.
---
But I will continue to work on my talents and make sure to focus on a final build
---
Tesla is great for tagging when you don’t want to one shot things .
---
Excuse me? You're the one who can't fucking shoot straight. Get your shit ass onto a different game loser
---
if your str is under 11 it will raise your carry weight.. if not it will roll with what you have..
---
basically PA is an auto 11 for STR + whatever you have above and beyond 11
---
Thanks, I'll try that.
---
Inventory management
---
In my opinion (and not all will like this proposal)
---
A way to improve the script system would be to lower the value of a scrip return to even the numbers and in exchange increase the scrip machine limit to 200.
---
Weapon costs 100/50/25
---
Weapon returns 30/15/5
---
Armor costs 60/30/15
---
Armor returns 20/10/5
---
Making all 1* equals.
---
That's where I am.  I just don't understand it.  It's not the end of the world, but I don't understand why people want to screw things up for others?  This, to me, is a microscopic manifestation of very large issues that ail the modern world.  It's narcissism, arrogance and greed all mixed up with a healthy dose of "whataboutism" and the blame (Bethesda) game.  
---
That said, this entire post is making a bigger deal out of it than it is IRL, lack of character in some fellow gamers aside.  I'm more curious than miffed.
---
You’re kidding. Yikes. 
---
I love this game and all, but seeing a lot of these things over the past couple weeks have really gotten to me. It’s crazy to me that people are STILL paying for stuff from the atom shop with actual money and rewarding Bethesda’s lack of quality testing.
---
I play my high level bloodied explosive rifleman only on a private server or if friends are doing high level content on the public ones. 
---
If I play on the public servers I use Old Man Jenkins, my level 12 responder volunteer. I wouldnt like it if it happened to me so I dont do it to others.
---
I start harassing players at workshops or talk shit at scorched earth when the game tells me to log off 5 minutes into my play session.
---
Yeah maybe it can give you a legendary module for each
---
She and the other ones in Watoga all got killed. :)
---
Thanks for sharing that.  I may or may not agree, but I do want a feel for how and why others are or are not participating.
---
Thanks! It's a bullet sponge and can be quite challenging.
---
  Blowing up a vehicle close enough to damage a robot will do it, too. 
---
 Don't worry, we've all been there :)  
---
  Couple weeks ago, I saw a legendary ghoul fighting with a Gutsy.  Close quarters, hit the ghoul with my knife, the Gutsy moved in, my next swing hit the Gutsy...
---
All heck breaks loose - the ghouls, an assaultron, sentrybot, and 3 Mr Gutsys immediately forgot the ghouls and started shooting at me.  I'm a whole lot higher level than you, but you know what I did?  Ran away as fast as my overencumbered self could go :)
---
Glad to know you got some help and achieved the goal.  
---
Only other advice I can give on that one is if you haven't already gone back to Riverside, don't.  If you can hold out until L50, the reward will be better.
---
Curious why shotgun specifically?
---
Shoot torso or legs
---
I didn’t even play 2 months ago so I never knew that, thanks for mentioning it. That makes it even worse. Just how?
---
clearly.. to enrage builders...
---
Syringer makes it super easy imo.
---
Edit:didnt know each pellet counted individually. Use a shotty instead
---
Shotguns shoot multiple pellets from one round, each pellet gets the critical effect, thus each pellet hit counts towards it.
---
It's all good, I'm glad we could come to terms instead of slinging names at each other, respect.
---
Wow that's not in the game at all
---
Look at all these sexist comments. Humanity is doomed.
---
Yes to all this
---
I've lost track of how many gauss minis I've crafted.  I'm starting to lose hope of ever getting a  a Bloody anything.  Hell I'd take a 1 star Bloody over the Mutant Slayers, Exterminators, and Medics I keep rolling.  Gotta find a hot server and grind out a bunch once I find it.
---
I keep seeing this about diminished returns and all that and anything passed 350dr is basically useless but how come I can see that I take more damage in the 300dr range but when I equip ironclad, barbarian, evasive, and a couple vanguard pieces I’m in the 500dr range it’s insanely noticeable how much more tanky I am? Am I just crazy? I mean it’s a pretty big difference I go from dying frequently and having to be more aware at 350dr to being borderline invincible at 550dr when the only thing I’m changing is dr nothing else.
---
Yeah, I get that, totally.  I'd go as far as to say that if I ever just walked away from you while you tried to trade in good faith, I apologize.  
---
I guess I bring this up because it's becoming more and more common now (the suspect traders).
---
Perfect, thanks
---
Me
---
Whenever I level up a new toon, I generally start my first Whitespring run at level 25. The thing that makes it possible is that I use a good low-level legendary handmade and stealth to do it. I rarely die in the process.
---
to swag out
---
Usually playing events, farming Morgantown airport, the asylum, killing Blood Eagles, buying from vendors (when the price is right) and from kind donations. Sometimes we'll go a few days struggling with very little but they tend to build up pretty quickly.
---
It would be the best imaginable weapon for my build, for sure.
---
If you don't want to use sneak, don't use sneak. Don't fuck up everyone else's good time because you don't like something.
---
8 pellets per shell. 8 crits (potentially).
---
Well i run a bloody stealth commando build and I only got the strangler heart as a collection item. Got the Gauss shot since my previous build was a mix of shotgun and commando weapons. Yeah the farm tiles seems like a good start and thought of getting the t-65 but heard it’s expensive ugly and not worth at all so idk. Currently have this freezer mod for my backpack so my food doesn’t spoil that fast but have like 8 opossum Badges left. But thx for your time to reply :)
---
For heavy gunners you get perks that just don't work outside of pa though.
---
A giant room sized one that we can scrooge mcduck dive into
---
Oh no, your aimbot that should have never been in a multiplayer game isn't working?
---
I love how supportive the Fallout community is. That’s probably why a PVP version didn’t work as well as Bethesda thought it would. &amp; I haven’t went yet, so thank you for that! I’ll hold off!
---
Aw now that makes me sad ):
---
For every "Kill X robots" challenge I've gone to Watoga.  Easy pickings for the Mayor...
---
I waited till player bases we're near and got the ghouls to chase me to their turrets. Easy XP and eventually could get into get the sword.
---
Who said we don't get killed? xD We die a lot and take a lot of stimpaks. In some instances we can use the Chinese Stealth Suit to hide out close to the action.
---
I’ll have to check it out, thank you! I’m a sucker for implied story telling in Bethesda games.
---
VATS has been bugged in PvP since Wastelanders. It works for some weapons but not others. Seems to be that hitscan weapons are the broken ones, though that’s not definitive.
---
Don't let them sell you Fallout 4 assets again.
---
Uh, it's looking pretty bad in PVE too.
---
Hmm, theoretically if you sell it on market you get more worth in caps than the caps worth of materials from it. But on the other hand we could get chance for legendary modules from scrapping. Like 33% from 1*, 66% from 2* and 100% from 3* item. That would be awesome.
---
I’ll have to check it out next time that I’m online; thank you!
---
I get that I don't know how we could have such a casual playerbase in a mmo
---
Where would I find treetops?
---
Now you know why Bethesada gave us the "bad day" icon :)
---
Depends on where you were in the Bog.
---
Completing Mayor for a Day will take care of the (Watoga) Assaultron problem.  Won't help you at Robco, though.
---
If you haven't already done it, 46 is a good level to (start or) finish up the Miner Miracles quest.
---
Yup one of my characters is blessed with this gift
---
They forgot trapper and raider.
---
Naw sounds like they asked for it
---
That worked for me the other day, though the SB was about half a mile away from the lure. I had to shoot it from range in order to kill it.
---
Is that what the green ship is supposed to mean?
---
*laughs in being so powerful a level 1 pipe pistol one shots any non boss mob*
---
Nope, i'm a full health build and the autocomplete only happened once.
---
Personally I kinda like the 8pm reset. Because if I didn't do the day before I can do that after work from 5 - 8pm then reset and do it again.
---
Confirmed no for the fixer and the recon sniper rifle.
---
Yea, so far so good
---
I wish I would’ve known that before I used a BE flamer for 50 crit hits
---
i wouldnt even be mad if they at least USED the "space station" theme for something. make the raiders use salvaged space suits or, i dunno, SOMETHING, you know? but no, it's just... a raider building, that used to be a crashed space station. such a waste...
---
In the Mire just south of Harpers Ferry

 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treetops?file=Treetops\_map.png](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treetops?file=Treetops_map.png)
---
Make sure you're activating crits. Make a oublic Exploration team for extra AP
---
Please share your build and armaments. I’d like to have a PvE Queen killer build. You melee or ranged?
---
I'm in. Lvl 493
---
Exactly. Or the “barter” thing like in Fallout 4, where you could buy something, but then sell out own things before finishing the transaction, thus bringing down the total. Or vice versa, selling your own stuff but buying some stuff from the vendor at the same time in one transaction. It baffles me that that wasn’t included.
---
It's the best way Fallout should be played. If I wanted to play a game all about automatic guns I'd turn on Fortnite.
---
I always fast travel to my camp before leaving the game
---
Same thing I brought up in a post a few weeks ago...Makes no sense...we can craft legendaries now...but some ho w we are not smart enough take them apart and repurpose the materials....lol
---
Yeah that would be cool to see tbh.
---
Eh.  I know what I wrote, but don't read TOO much into it.  Granted, I am judging the person's actions in the context of the game, but I am more interested in exploring the why and the numbers than judging the actual person.  
---
I don't know, and could never know, if that behavior manifests itself outside the game (or games), where it is fantasy land, but overall, in society, there is no denying that this kind of mentality is rampant and destructive.
---
interesting. were you getting full sneak bonus?
---
I used to love to take the time to find lowbies on the map and drop them decent (2shots, furious, junkies, instigating usually) level appropriate weaps/armor that i'm just gonna scrip anyway but 9 times outta 10 they tell me they don't need it cuz they're on their alt sooooo i just stopped doing it : / now i just throw em in a suitcase at whatever station im at. The rare occasion an actual new player stumbles into my camp making heart emotes and asking if they can get a discount on some serums....bruh i'm gonna craft em all for you for free, and hell i'll throw in a set of excavators if you don't have it already
---
You have picked up one of the items he asks for (before he asked for it), while out and about and you haven't realised, it'll be in your misc (like multiscope or osmosis kit etc). He never takes it when this happens and quest auto completes
---
Lmao that’s not even the point. I mean yeah I pretty much don’t sneak anymore because everything I mentioned in my post, but the point is it’s unbalanced. How am I fucking anything up? You think Bethesda’s gonna take my reddit post and rework the whole game?   Yeah I think I sneak damage is bullshit, there’s absolutely zero sense in why it does so much damage and then on top of that there’s perk cards to increase it anymore. All I’m saying is, it’s over powered and in an rpg game that’s played online with other people, balancing should be priority to keep the game fair and entertaining for everyone. It’s not fun when OTHER players are one shotting hordes and legendary before you can even get a shot in. It’s just dumb. It makes me want to play solo but then that’s not why I want to play fallout 76, they have all the other fallouts for that. I enjoy this game I just want to be balanced.
---
I was thing since there are two extra legendary effect stars while inspecting, those could be potential slots for modules.
---
Haha I beat it all in 3 hours
---
You can’t claim it’s “just cosmetics” when that isn’t the issue I have with their business models. I don’t mind games having cosmetic items for sale. I play lots of other games that do. 
---
But it’s when they design their lootboxes in a way that’s nothing short of predatory towards their players. And crown crates are the perfect example of that. 
---
You can either try your luck with gambling for what you want through crates, or continue to pump money into it until you get enough gems to buy it. But both require boat loads of money, and the system encourages you to keep spending with a “chance” of getting what you want. 
---
It’s another reason they pulled a majority of mounts/pets from being directly purchased from the store. They make more from the players who will spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on their game, so their new business model reflects that. 
---
I don’t care much about cosmetics, I get free gems from twitch drops and save for what I want. But even still you can’t deny it’s a really shitty system and it takes advantage of their player base. That’s what I have a problem with.
---
Thanks for the insight. I’ll have to check it out!!!
---
T-65
---
Yea you can stack up to three. And there should be a way to remove effects as well
---
Thank you so much! There are more here if you want to take a look: https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery
---
Have to agree with the other user. Aimbot shouldn't be a thing to begin with for any sort of pvp in any game. 
---
In other games aimbot is considered cheating, and while VATS is a staple part of FO itself, it should have never been pvp capable.
---
I am kind of a medium level (119) and still tweaking my build. I keep going to events like project paradise and when i find the legendary i tag it and then emote, but i try not to kill it.
---
Inevitably i find myself running from some legendary ghoul who kills me then the assholes who show up to finish it off take all my junk as thanks, so i can't even find where I died to recover the item from the legendary.
---
That and the people with giant laser gatlings blasting things to bits before anyone else can are super annoying. It's not a competition. You don't get more if everyone else loses.
---
I love Grafton! I have spent most of my time there since release.
---
Its lonely tho :(
---
Lmao, now thats funny
---
Mid 30's....Try heading over to the Mining HQ building near the 3 leg towers and start the Miner Miracles quest.  It's probably going to take you some time to collect everything you need.
---
BTW, if the critters are high level, server hop until they are not.
---
This is why I run Bloodied. I can’t tank anything, especially those damned floaters. Their sole purpose is to fuck over is Bloodied builds.
---
You can currently get:
---
Survivor Items (Including Ghille Suit) - 14,650 XP total for all items
---
Halloween Items (Including Skeleton Suit) - 14,000 XP total for all items
---
X-mas Items (Including the Fur-lined Jacket and Jeans) - 27,001 XP for all items
---
You can do this, can't you? When in the trade screen, you can both buy and sell. So buy what you want, to pump up the vendor's caps, and then sell what you need to sell.
---
Daily limits are bs an artificial way to nerf your chances of getting items that are actually worth having. Removing daily limits would make people way less desperate to dupe.
---
Really, even when not using shotguns it's still a piece of piss.   However, the level up daily challenge and some of the NW ones can fuck right off.
---
Didn’t play yesterday, logged in this morning before the daily update and two of the weekly were completed.  Kill large creatures and build up a camp. PS4, first time for me.
---
It was the first building I bought. I set it up with one of the big windows facing off the side of a cliff. Tried to line my bed up just perfect and promptly fell to my death. 
---
At least I had a convenient respawn point...
---
I hope Bethesda sees this, bro ❤️
---
Same happened to me today for first time with my dailies, PC wasn't even on lol :-)
---
Single player Fallout, yes. And I don't quite understand your reasoning, as automatic guns are superior in VATS (at least they were in PvP).
---
Slightly off topic but out of curiosity, why are you using a TS weapon if you’re a “bloodied” build?
---
The people who pay for fallout first and buy all the micro transactions are the people who didn't want this game to be muloplayer and hide in their private sessions.
---
Shhh....
---
I run around in an owl mask with a shitty rifle because I love both. Instead of dropping stuff someone wants to trade me. Ok. He sees my kick ass armor, multiple raven masks, and bloodied 3 star stock pile and just says "....I cant top that". It was sad. He sounded kind of dead inside. Never judge a book by its cover ;-)
---
Awesome! Do you stream too? If so what’s your channel name? And feel free to add me on PSN: Jaymike27
---
this is the type of stuff i want on this sub, not everyone complaining
---
Collect bubblegum. Thank me later
---
a little QOL enhancement just for you
---
My main gun is a bloodied recon sniper rifle but the reload speed is awful. I have a full set of 3\* unyielding armor. Typically my shots in PvE do 2500 dmg. Should I be doing something differently?
---
I still see people do this pretty often. Several times lately, I've seen people give the "come this way" emote next to the legendary but then go ahead and one shot it two seconds later. That really doesn't count as helpful, guys.
---
They’re all still chasing the Runescape gf that got away
---
Yeah same, i wanted to build something but didn't want to move my camp so i dumped a bunch of stuff, plans and materials on a new character so i could build what i wanted. Now i get people babysitting me and giving me plans and water and stims and I am like thanks, but I don't need this. I had to go on area mic to tell one person level 45 to stop giving me stuff, she kind of adopted me.
---
I wanted to friend her just so I could go on my main and shower her with goodies but I didn't have the chance.
---
Also .... SHHHHHhhhhhh......
---
I never saw the plans until the 40s. Then I bought them and they are on every vendor I see.
---
I think with the new static vendor inventory that many things are level restricted and hidden until you hit a specific level.
---
Again with my naivete, is this done on purpose? Is it how all the kool kids name themselves these days? I have never seen one myself, on PS4.
---
An idea that I've been toying around with is for Bethesda to periodically remove daily scrip caps. Like for one week every three months. They could even bill it as Spring (Summer/Fall/Winter) Cleaning.
---
Isn’t this already a thing? I got a warning today that my ★★★ Armor would only grant 12 scrip instead of the full 24 as I was currently at 988.
---
Hahah! Funny you say that. I claimed Gorge Junkyard, got 40 black titanium scrap to be safe, went back and cleared the robots just to learn I didn’t have enough of them damn screws. I have so many desk fans in my inventory rn it’s unreal
---
A B2525 Fixer is now legacy?  I did not know this.  It doesn't change anything I said, though.  
---
The logic of the birds is not sound.  Hens fly.  Hens do not, however, lay golden eggs, which is what I assume the drop rate of a B2525 Fixer would be roughly comparable to.  Hyperbole aside, I would like to know the actual numbers, if they are out there.  The percentages, the way the different aspects of possible combinations are set to drop, etc.
---
Another glitch i have encountered is when respawning. I would select a place to respawn but it would just ‘fast travel’ me to said location , however it would behave like i didn’t respawn yet so i couldn’t move or do anything, it was just stuck on that (space) respawn screen and if i was in a nuke zone i would take rads and get stuck in this endless loop. Often times i’d die after an SBQ fight and i couldn’t respawn in time to get my stuff back so people would take my flux. It really baffles me how they can’t do something as simple as respawning correct
---
My Gauss shotty is glitchy as hell, in a good way, it one shots at 2% hit chance from 100m away (magic effect) and every other shot makes the crit noise trigger without me pressing the crit button, that challenge was over in 5 - 10 mins :-)
---
It was a dev room mod. The gilded minigun used to be a spawn.
---
File support ticket and ask for Atoms back. They won't replace your gun.
---
A few days ago I tried to make buns from the same dough instead. Here is the result, two sets of result actually, it never collapsed and it's perfect:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/2Uobx9a](https://imgur.com/a/2Uobx9a)
---
When you do the dough, I split it in half (then repeat based on how many buns you want :D) shape them and leave to rise (I use an oven with a bowl of HOT water). After I leave it for like an hour, I whisk eggyolk and use a brush to "spread" it at the top, sprinke with seeds you want and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350.
---
Blocker. Anything that adds DR is bad.
---
Why is this?  Does the syringer built crits faster, or use less AP to fire, or what?  Curious as I don't play with crits at ALL as a heavy PA gunner so I've been taking to Morgantown airport to slowly build crits on all the scorched there and then shotgun them to reap the maximum reward.  Should I be using the syringer to build crits then switch to the shotty?
---
It was the first bundle I got, using the atoms I had from subscribing. I bought a month as I usually don't have as much time to play games as I have for this past month, so I figured why the hell not.
---
For that to be my first experience... It has soured me on camp items. I don't regret buying the month but I certainly can't justify spending more on such a glitchy game, with invisible QA.
---
Totally agree. I only fear another grind if they continue bringing in factions...
---
It's sad that this game is based around automatic hip fire weapons to survive in PvP. I like using hard hitting single shot weapons.
---
That my understanding of it. You have to reach the end of the board before he does, he will reach the last space on the last day of the season
---
Atom Cats, Abraxo
---
You all are still giving Bethesda money, what reason do they have to improve themselves (serious question)?
---
I've heard consoles charge devs money and have to put them through all kindsa extra stuff to run a patch on consoles so they probably don't want to pay and do that for a small update and they wait for when enough stuff is crammed into it to keep profits maximized. But that's just my assumption.
---
Cuz Warframe patches stuff on PC immediatly and at random hours sometimes in middle of the night if needed. But consoles always take much longer, and I don't think Bethesda wants to split patch dates between platforms?
---
I always feel like consoles hold games back all the time in this day and age. But I'm sure they have more than enough resources to do it if they really wanted to.
---
If the grind is long enough to make players use exploits then maybe the loop needs to be reexamined. Make legendary modules more expensive but let the player choose their prefix on armour or weapons
---
I think the ammo converter update is coming as well though I can find my source atm
---
Agreed, want some scrap box skins. It would also be nice if we could put things on top. Like the radio.
---
I didn't think they could be traded, as they auto deleted if you get rid of it out of your inventory?
---
Should use a shotty. I didnt know about the pellets. I used a syringer because of its low damage, and cheap ammo production.
---
Also Blocker.
---
Well the TS rifles in general aren’t as good as bloodied rifle if you’re running a bloodied setup. The damage number you see on the weapons stats is split between the 2 bullets. One of the bullets will miss quite often especially in VATS. You would have better damage maximization if you acquired a bloodied fixer, handmade, or combat rifle.
---
Pick up a 10mm pistol and roam around morgantown.
---
Multiple bonuses:
---
Relatively east to get the criticals
---
if you visit mama dolces, you can also work towards the kill X robots with a pistol atom challenge.  (Protectrons, turrets, and liberators all count as robots.)
---
4 events: feed the people, back on the beat, collision course, and jailbreak are all in the same area.
---
Best alternative display them in your vendor. If you make them overpriced people will see the rotating image when they mouse over, but will never buy it.
---
Its fun to the people who like the BOS. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean that there aren't others who do.
---
Either wait for its inevitable death or get another pet
---
This came broken since day one and people still give them money every month and praise them for "fixing it" and giving us things that should be in game since day one so.. why should derpesda change?
---
No but everyone I play with says I should. I'm thinking about it. lol my psn is Knightofthecrow.
---
does the colossus have a min amount of damage you need to inflict like the SBQ?
---
but yeah. It's a shame you couldn't have got the colossus and queen to fight cos that is epic. Also good on you being nice like that
---
Water is flat. There are numerous ponds/lakes to build on. A very large one along the southern map border south of about south watch tower.
---
The hunting rifle with the 50 cal receiver and piercing mag. It's my main weapon.
---
For how long?
---
This would work if display images weren’t broken right now.
---
Or you only have a 3 star item and the scrip count is 38...
---
Although the dupe could still be active,I don't think many are still risking their account,given bethesda has banned even people who did them very few times.
---
Plus if you get addicted to alcohol it'll cure dehydration. I haven't drank purified water since I got the raider collectron.
---
Better yet remove the damn scrip limit
---
You could check the map and see when folks are down there. they are most likely clearing all those bloated sacks out. If on xbox I would be happy to help you get to the objective. If not on xbox, I'm sure someone on your platform would help you if you asked it.
---
Jesus I wish they'd hire obsidian again
---
I didn't realize the damage was split. I thought it was doubled. Thanks!
---
Let me rephrase that. It'll cure dehydration no matter what but if you're already a drunk you don't have to worry about becoming one.
---
Was usually mininukes for me. I knew for certain I would have some but says 0 in pipboy/on weapon. Also overencumbered but apparently lower than the amount needed to be overencumbered. Restarting the game finally showed the mininukes and set my carry weight correctly.
---
NVM, I re-read and see you differentiated between the legacy item and Fixer in your last comment.
---
I apologize if this is a dumb question as my main is only like level 90, but how do people get enough legendaries to make the daily scrip limit a consistent problem?  I feel like I’ve hit it maybe twice before.
---
My B25 Ultracite Gatling Laser shreds.  No magic bugs, no explosive splash damage to worry about.  Just Power User and Batteries Included, Stabilized and a good set of PA, to spit green death at everything down my sights.  Love having 1k rounds to firehose out, with 50 or 60k more in reserve at all times.  Just wish I could mod my PA to use Ultracite cores too.
---
Aahhh, good to know, is there a place to look up average item prices?
---
Hey, I’m on Xbox too! I’m not just gonna use you for XP but I’m always looking for someone to adventure with if you’re interested!
---
Yep
---
Yeah.   Have to find the optimum mix of solo and nonsolo playtime?
---
A lot of glitches I’m seeing are also computers users computers tend to have some more problems a lot of which due to compatibility issues there’s a million software builds for computers but only one or two for Xbox or PlayStation
---
Dont got anyone to play with tho, thats why i go solo lol
---
You guys keep buying atoms and asking for more things on the atom store. Why do you think they keep getting away with not testing anything?
---
xD Thank you. Made me smile.
---
LOL!
---
This game is an equivalent of soviet system.
---
75% negated.*
---
and the motion assist servos mod adds +2 STR.
---
One of the mutations adds even more.  I have 15 STR as a start point, but 19 after mods and mutations add and subtract.
---
It's an exploit, I'm not gonna describe how to do it, but people can trade these
---
" *Luck is a measure of general good fortune, and affects the recharge rate of Critical Hits as well as the* ***condition and durability*** *of items that the player loots.* "
---
And yes, was wrong about crafted. Had just woken up.
---
How much? Also can someone share a video?
---
What are the other stars? Only 1 star?
---
op is in pa so no backpack
---
That’s because you’re hitting the limit you can hold, not the limit you can receive from the vendor.
---
I don’t know WHY they haven’t added that feature to both sides there though
---
I run an instigating bow that I will switch out with guns periodically.  I've taken it to both a scorchbitch fight, line in the sand and done radiation rumble with it, it's what I had in hand and didn't feel like switching perks on the fly after quickly joining events that were already in progress. I kept the scorchbitch poisoned just about the entire fight and easily did enough damage from that (assuming she's not immune to poison) and headshots doing about 250 per shot that I got a drop. Not the best weapon to take, but I more than held my own in each of those events. I held one entire side of radiation rumble down just about by myself and had a pile of dead ghouls at the corner to loot when I was done. Line in the sand was one where nobody put their tent down so the mobs spawned in the right spot. All the big boys in their power armor with their bloodied melee and magic guns builds didn't have anything to kill on my side because I was one shotting them all at their spawn point.
---
Any good sneak/snipe build can easily work a bow and it's more deadly than a gun. Just got to learn how to hit in VATS the right way.
---
If you are at 5k bullion you won't get any more if you turn in scrip.
---
Especially with 4 Leave Clover. Basically every second shot is a critical.
---
Must test bffr lmg vs bffr gat plasma one day. My preference is for the gatling plasma but I'd like to know....
---
That's weird, I got that message for hitting max scrip.  You think this would be there as well.
---
Try just south of the Sunnytop Railroad station. Generally flat enough there. Ive had a general store set up before Fasnacht, and then I've had set of Condos and a then a gun range. Its a neat little place.
---
If I throw out the over here emote after tagging something, let the legendary beat on me for 10+ seconds and no one shows? Their loss. I’m killing it.
---
Just keep playing and you’ll get there. I’ve given up on getting my daily scrips and just get them whenever. I still have a lot of useless legos in my stash.
---
I did this once with my bloodied axe. Even I was unaware of its power and I one shot the mole miner supervisor.
---
I'm sorry to everyone in the event with me, especially the guy who did the angry emote.
---
They did this specifically to enforce the daily cap limit. Notice how every time you buy something from a vendor, the amount of caps that the vendor gets from the transaction is less than how much you paid for said item
---
The dupe isn't active but players are still trading the non-tradeable items. Would be cool if Bethesda did a ban wave over that too. Let that be our final warning
---
Never seen it at line in the sand before. I see it at west tek and huntersville every so often. Supermutants just standing there. In their underwear, doing nothing. Occasionally they teleport but other then that they do nothing
---
Are you the one who wouldn't accept my 50 super stimpaks the other day?? 😂
---
Also I must be the only person in existence without a mule or multiple characters...
---
I already bought it so the price is gone, but I think it was 200 or 250. Hopefully someone else can say the exact amount. No way for me to take a video but here's a picture of it. 
---

---
wait. scrip or treasury notes? scrip doesnt turn into bullion.
---
haha nice, I have him dressed up like mothman with the ghille suit and mothman glasses. (I run a cryptid themed cafe and have him be a door greeter)
---
I bought the red rocket bundle (the one with the big rocket) and I still don't have my garage door.
---
Or maybe it’s a special type of hell on earth. Imagine being a QA tester who tries to flag issues and nobody listening, and watching janky code roll into production week after week.
---
Oh dear...
---
Game hasn’t even been out 2 years....
---
What did you expect next week that isn’t happening?
---
So far I’ve come across this random encounter 3 times and it’s just been at random, different places on the map
---
Have you tried explosive bait?
---
Bethesda*
---
Oh nice. I may need to grab
---
At level 60, me and two other unarmed + commando builds, crush the queen in 30 seconds. No cheese guns. Just in game mechanics and buffs. That said, the use of magic guns in queen fights is getting crazy. I keep one on hand in case the other players aren't OP, but i prefer to have her alive, spawning mobs on the ground. Its more fun.
---
Yeah the legendry run is what keeps me going atm. Just don't want to fall behind and top tier rewards look pretty decent.
---
I got it from the machine the other day and was so pissed. I was even more pissed after it scrapped itself while it was in my stash box (that was the day I found out my scrapbook items don't get used first wtf)
---
The end game is repetition of quests. I do the dailies to get treasury notes on two of my characters. I do the other dailies to pick up scrip. I do the events that give treasury notes. 
---
I clear out high level spawn areas, hoping to land a legendary and a decent drop. 
---
I have reached the end game for 4 different characters &amp; they’re all different builds.  The fun comes from their different strengths and weaknesses. 
---
I personally don’t get bored because I enjoy Fallout to such an extent.
---
I really cant agree with this because the team for ESO pumps out content regularly and it all works pretty well (minus the few odd glitches).
---
Seems to be that Bethesda Austin is uniquely awful at...everything lol
---
I've felt a lot more tanky with ever since I've passed 600 dr, I havent been able to get an accurate test yet since I just reached 700. It might be me but getting the number up feels pretty good.
---
My understanding is patch 21 is majority bug fixes. The patch is not centered around the event.
---
I've used both versions of the same gun and I always prefer the handmade
---
Yep.
---
Silly rabbit, you're applying logic &amp; reasoning to a Bethesda product.
---
Kidding aside, they were just one short of nearly making that happen.  Make 3-star armor 25 scrip instead of 24.  2-star 10 instead of 9.  and 1-star armor 5 instead of 3.  Boom, even.
---
But no.  Because....Bethesda.
---
Just logged in into the game and noticed all my daily challenges are auto completed as well except the NW one. I left the NW challenge unfinished yesterday and had it on my tracked list.
---
I hope with brotherhood they add a new faction to the game and new NPCs. Wastelanders was the reason I started playing f76. Can't imagine how bleak it would have been before that.
---
Should be in lights , then look for the lamps maybe ?
---
It’s 20 euro/month?? That’s almost double the price in USD
---
Thats why i am currently playing the entire saga starting from Fo1. Im tired of this game ALOT.
---
I've tried the quest like three times and something always went wrong for me. I'm in the same boat.
---
Personally I'd love to see a group of ex-military and emergency responders that had banded together come back and reform the Responders out of Watoga - right smack in the middle of the map. Have them become a proper faction, then when the BoS returns and starts leaning on the settlers etc. pushing them for supplies etc. they butt heads with the Responders who try to protect everyone in WV.
---
You’re unfortunately about 2 months too late...
---
All of mine except the critical hits one which strangely 10/50. It’s like I had someone else’s challenges
---
Its already been : /
---
Get out of here
---
I just started, I keep finding random paper bags on the floor when browsing my Inventory. They have all sorts of stuff in them but I was afraid to take them because I thought it was hackers baiting me.
---
Na all my plasmas were crafted so Bethesda scammed me out of a core
---
I WANT A REFUND ON THAT CORE
---
Lights. It’s in the same row as table lamps
---
I know how to cheese the level up i just wish they would mix it up alittle bit.  I amdont wanna level up or trade 3 times anymore.  Have me kill 100 radrats of 3 legged trashcans instead!
---
If the duoe is not active then I don't think there is still a way to pass those items between players
---
The problem is not the players or the build. It's the lack of loot sharing. If a group of people are doing a public event and they kill a legendary enemy, then that legendary loot should be available to all those players participating in that event.
---
It shouldn't be the players responsibility to allow another player to get a hit on one ghoul that is in the middle of a group of 6 ghouls. I deal 7k dmg headshots to ghouls with my unarmed build. I would have either un-equip my weapon or change it to a different one, whilst i'm doing that someone with a lever action will kill that legendary in a blink of an eye.
---
In short - The legendary loot system needs adjustments, the players aren't at fault here.
---
Wookie till you Win!
---
It's gotten to the point where you shouldn't even really blame other players anymore. 
---
Blame Bethesda for making it so legendaries are on a first-come first-serve basis, and that there are builds strong enough to one-shot most enemies in the game.  The game doesn't really give you any suggested guidelines on etiquette, that's just a forum/Reddit thing.  It's not something players are under any obligation to follow, so unless Bethesda changes how the system works, complaining about it isn't going to do anything anymore, especially since 
---
I've seen this same exact topic like 10 times over.  I wish highlighting the same issue to Bethesda made them more likely to change it faster, but apparently it doesn't work like that, otherwise we might have seen changes a year ago.
---
And everything on the wiki is 100% correct? HaHa. It's not going to affect both Durability AND Condition. There's also no info/values regarding Durability when you scroll down. It should *probably* say "the condition OF durability". ;)
---
I agree on the interaction side. It lacks heavily the social aspect as no one really has a mic so it's down to one off emotes. Public teams was a right direction, but they need to add more.
---
It’s still bugged. I found out yesterday when someone literally put it as a trap on their camp. I fell out of the edge of a mountain for about 5 seconds before dying BUT god bless life saving armor.
---
Im Sorry, its 15 Euro
---
Meat week is tho
---
Damn. How could i make such a silly mistake? Sorry
---
On Xbox? I need ultracite ammo haha
---
Bro it already came this year lol
---
The number of times I've been fighting something and heard that clanking behind me followed by an insult...ugh.
---
I would appreciate any of those thirty guns lol
---
Bethesda: "We have taken this suggestion into account, and now all one, two, and three-star legendary weapons and armor are exchangeable for exactly 5 scrip each"
---
Any tips to lvl up through the ranks?
---
I hope that this upcoming iteration of the brotherhood in 76 is different because of their West Virginia roots.
---
FO3, NV, and FO4 all had distinct BoS factions that were unique in their own way and that added to the overall story. I would hate to have a rehashed FO4 version that has us doing the same fetch quests for looting technology or killing ghouls/super mutants.
---
Yup, i think most veteran players will side with you. Got burnt too many times when trying to be nice. Also, some people are fucking clueless and have the response time of a sloth. I'm not going to emote for a full minute before you realize there is a legendary here.
---
Wait, if you mistype the code you have to use ANOTHER NUKE CARD?
---
That’s...
---
That’s just wrong.
---
Scrip?
---
[I did it for the Skelly Costume...](https://imgur.com/a/DvL5uWz)
---
This. Better xp farming mobs and chances for extra items and mats. We farm her on a private server just to keep her alive until the end of the timer.
---
If you play often then yeah. Absolutely. 
---
The scrapbox will probably free up about 400 lbs of your stashbox. You could do what i and few other people do. Take it for a month or two. Fill the scrapbox as much as possible and then cancel it. You can still access your junk to get stuff out. And then when you feel it's getting low subscribe again.
---
If you use sights the handmade. If you use vats the fixer
---
They LIKE cheesecake factory, the WORK at Chili's...gotta do something in between losing :-P
---
Whats fun is not having my head up my ass.  They announced this fix over a week ago, complaining that they aren't fixing it NOW is just being stupid.
---
Going to have to disagree here. I know the card says 75% but in effect it completely negates this one. Likely due to rounding numbers. You can't have -.5 on a stat.
---
I'll buy the bloodied pipe pistol off you if you're on PC!
---
&gt;Dodgy
---
That works in PA?
---
I think you’re referring to meat week.
---
The difference between nms and fo76 is hello games actually give a shit about that games future and have improved it 10fold since launch, fo76 tho Bethesda couldn't give less shits and I'm afraid starfield is gonna go the same sprial downwards that 76 has
---
Look pretty.
---
As with many games, the endgame is all about the barbie.
---
Because no-one on their team plays their game. It’s a job, not a passion.
---
I don’t tame pets, but would wonder if you could just go tame another pet and it’d replace the pet you currently have?
---
Well, yes, but I’m referring to a thing from previous Fallout games where you could basically set up several purchases but then select items to sell, balancing out the total or making them owe you, all in a single transaction, without having to make each purchase base or sale one at a time.
---
Just tame another pet and it will replace your current one.
---
No, it's fixed on the PTS and has been for over a week now... just because something is on the PTS doesn't mean it's literally being tested, the PTS is just the most current build they're working on with all the general additions including things being tested and things that are just ready for the next update.
---
True. Much less
---
Yeah...been there, was so sure I was helping...
---
Edit: my encounter was the parking lot hotspot just north of the fairgrounds
---
The unradiated fancy lad cake in the corner of the desk.
---
Could you please be so kind as to point me the right direction to ask for a refund? I also bought the underarmor skin and cannot use it. Also have the silent, not silent PA skin but got a while ago, do you think I can get a refund on that also?
---
Multiplayer, yeah its dope. 
---
Nuke winter though? Takes up half your game size in gigs, im just saying Imo NUCLEAR WINTER is a joke, compared to halo or cod or other renowned online multiplayer shooters.
---
Games taking up so much space on my drive for crap that doesnt even matter. Sorry not sorry... 
---
Grew up playing fallout, this game is literally a sad display of effort and creativity, compared to what i grew up on. Nuff said.
---
Something smaller would be nice. You can use the floor safe to make your stash box take up no space but the scrap box is still huge.
---
Ah, I see what you're saying.
---
Yeah, that would be nice to be able to see it all in one go, but the core mechanic of "refilling" the vendor by buying stuff you need is still there.
---
I believe there’s a fo76 marketplace subreddit.
---
Instant gratification is the culprit.
---
I just know if I get all the awesome stuff it removes the fun. Most of the experience is the journey from Vault 76 scrub to demi-god.
---
I just like earning stuff myself I suppose.
---
I'm level 170 lmao but seriously after the initial hype not many people fo the event atleast on ps4
---
&gt;only shielded **casual** under armor can be applied to atomic shop under armor
---
Being that it states that it's part of the Casual mod group in the purchase screen this would be correct.
---
True. Just seems more tedious in my opinion. Plus you could purchase a plan, but then add a bunch of your stuff to the purchase to bring down the cost of the plan.
---
Thanks, I consider it.
---
You could try and trade for one or find one in a player vendor other than that it’s all rng
---
&gt;There's also no info/values regarding Durability when you scroll down
---
Didn't you just also say "And everything on the wiki is 100% correct? HaHa." 
---
\*slow clap\*
---
Honestly i wouldn't worry about it. Most people have way to much stuff. I wish i could find ppl that could take my stuff😂
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/PAaAfzN
---
Yeah but have you looked at your butt yet
---
Oh nice! I was gonna make a giant 5 x 7 x 2 as the base then work with the roof and generator room afterwards, all metal walling
---
Uranium Fever won't drop you a max level one...
---
Try adding Encryptid into the mix. Run The Burrows to grab the legendary at the end.
---
It's all rng unless you buy/trade for one
---
Oh, that sounds decent. I might scout it out later.
---
Anywhere in the cranberry bog, just love the look.
---
the price should be a plan you can learn so you can craft a jumbo fuzzy plushie in you camp.
---
Bethesda does this with all new games focusing on the “more sale” rather than keeping the fan base they already have, I mean if you can make a great game 10-15 years ago how hard is it to fuck it up. Just stop realising new content for a year roll out a plan for performance and bugs who gives a fuck though. Any one who plays PvP in ESO knows what I’m talking about
---
Yesssss! I need the French tip manicure skin for my MMG, which is my primary weapon. I still have the candy claws on it but I need more. I wish the skins that come out could be used on all weapons. Melees need love, too. 
---
Also... a salvaged beauty salon camp set, including an old school fits over your head hair dryer, which would totally fit the time frame. 
---
Need.
---
You can read. Well done! How can something be correct, or incorrect, if it's not even stated you silly sausage.
---
Ah thank you. Cause I want it somewhere in the middle, but also somewhere new and experianced players can find and come visit. And because its gonna be a scrap trade, I might as well make it filled with shelves of boxes, decor, and other junk to make it look the part of a giant storangs warehouse
---
How on earth did you get there already? Was it just a lot of hours gaining XP? As that must have taken ages at only 100/10K xp.
---
Umm sure looks like ss armour to me bud. Pa resistances are way lower than what op is pumping out
---
I am fine with more grinding :P I am ok with doing the same thing over and over xD Buuut i know many is not like that, haha.
---
You're better off grinding West Tek and other places that spawn lots of leveled mobs.
---
Only you can answer that. Try it for one month. If at the end of the month you feel you could do without it, just cancel. 
---
Many players buy one month, put as much scrap as possible into the box, then cancel for 2-3 months until their scrap runs low. Repeat.
---
Shelves with items are expensive on budget. Just so you are prepared.
---
Last thing I do every single day before logging off before the reset is play NW.  I do not log back into adventure mode before closing the game.  I have never once had a challenge auto complete.
---
Is the secret service armor better than legendary armor? I have the jet pack but wasn’t sure how I felt about getting the rest of the set if I would wear them.
---
you could play for 100 hours and find nothing good. You could play for 10 hours and find something good. There's no set way of finding something good.
---
Get your settler rep up and buy the gauss shotgun plans
---
Dope. I might try it out. Would you want to join me and maybe a few others. Be apart of the building team if ya want. And you'll get to be apart of my brand new Wasteland Travels scrapbook adventure. I was gonna do a bit where we are app dressed yo as construction workers with hard hats and stuff and get a before and after picture in front of the place.
---
He’s using unyielding armor
---
It's so satisfying when you get a good group though all of you tapping the legendary with their rifle butts herding it around
---
For. The. Proletariat
---
Okay I won't be able to get on until later tonight. But I will be sure to add you. Thanks again!!
---
Iam in but why hahah?
---
always love watching the reddit communists get mad whenever anyone mocks their shitty ideology.
---
I'm on my 9th shovel (I now keep them and mount them on the wall of my camp) 4 came from Scorchbeast Queen, 2 from legendary Scorchbeast, 2 from lvl 80 legendary sheepsquatch, 1 from level 90 deathclaw.
---
Good mix of 1 and 3 \* shovels...yay...
---
What's your GT? I'll check for you the next time I'm on. My GT is Deviant Monster but don't let that fool you. I'm nice enough.
---
2 bar hits? Damn that's tough lol.
---
But yea, a shotgun is your friend.
---
I personally love rifles. Decent fire rate, and decent amount of vats.
---
Freddys House Of Fears. Always a glowing one or wendigo there, costumes, spookies. The private room on top of it has a good amount scrap too.
---
Yeah, I figured, the middle I'd gonna be populated by shelves n boxes. And the left side is gonna be generator and crafting/scrapping, right side is gonna be bedroom and kitchen, as well as the store front.
---
Hmmm, I have a BFFR GP collecting dust. I should try it out :-)
---
I probably could.
---
I still feel rng can be influenced, hell, I've been picking up a bunch of handmades recently (nothing good)
---
I would say use a handmade, any handmade, use your explosive shotgun. If you start seeing, explosive or handmade legendaries or even just normal handmades drop from regular enemies, spend some scrip. Only two or three tries unless you get something that is encouraging.
---
Thanks, I've heard the gauss shotgun is great, are there any really good legendary effects I should be looking for?
---
Sounds pretty chill. Ive been making super farms lately with the addition of the turbo fert grenade.
---
Yeah, I've been saying that for a while. Group events should allow all participants the ability to loot the legendaries. 
---
My game is so laggy that if I switched to a lower weapon for the legendary (by the time it spawned in) I'd miss out on hitting it anyway, forget trying to run to it for a melee shot if I'm on the other side of the area. And if I used a lesser weapon the entire time then I'd have my ass handed to me way more than I'd like to consider or be able to enjoy.. especially when half the time, if I do get to hit a legendary but die and it dies right after me, then it acts like I never hit it. Happens on the queen so often and I'll laser that lady the entire time but miss on loot if I die and can't spawn back in time to hit her again before she dies.
---
It's definitely a game thing that needs changed. Yeah, people could be less of dicks at times, but it's hard to say when it's done intentionally or not.
---
Simply Court, just like Reddit but minus 1 y. I think it’s time for a new one haha
---
Yes but..not that you asked...Serendipity does not.
---
I think you misunderstood the chart. Not everything on it was directly tied to the Legendary Run.
---
Meat Week has many meat-cooks. Many chance for big win!
---
&gt; also helps if you can increase your intelligence till I think 20 to get 200% cores. 
---
This is both correct and incorrect
---
Yes, High Int does increase the level of charge that crafted Cores have. No Int 20 doesn't give you 200%, I had Int 23 for the longest time and got 130%(ish) cores, I boosted up to 35+ and till never got 200% cores
---
We already have the gauss rifle, which is really good with the right build. Base damage, no specs for the rifle and base damage is around 250. Rifleman cards buff that up even more and you can also prime it for a bit more damage. Add on bloody mess and demolition expert and you're rocking.
---
That's amazing! Ha!
---
That's a different story. I always try to make those kind of attempts, you can't win every time.
---
Oh dope. I have a small adhesive farm that lets you make 8 adhesive at a time if you have the green thumb perk
---
Blame Jagex
---
It’s hard to narrow it down. 
---
I know where I don’t like: Anything on the right hand side of the map.
---
I spent a ton of time in Grafton, so that’s probably the correct answer.
---
I was doing radiation rumble and there were only 4 of us. I figured I'd take a hall and defend. Some cheese artist with his explosive gat is posted where he can see both halls. Not a bad plan I thought. Then he proceeds to crush both sides.  OK ill pick then cool. Get to my second room and 2 workers are dying. Run back and the center is over run and cheese boy is chasing a legendary. Reading is not a strong suit of the new players in events.  Its super rare for me to see a well thought out encrypted, project paradise, or radiation rumble. Just chase legendaries and ignore the event details. You already have every damn duped gun in the game! You can't adapt and do the event well?
---
Doesn't matter. That is just people trying to find the reason the challenges bug out when they say to do this and that. I personally have gotten the bug without even going to NW for 2 weeks. And doing everything else people say you must do to prevent it from happening.
---
This bug is just a random thing. It either happens to you or it doesn't.
---
I can only assume the team for FO76 is very bare bones at this point. They probably have a portion of Beth Austin working on other games
---
you're the one being a little \* about it. I know it works because I already tested it. if you want, test it yourself. or don't. it's your problem.
---
Hey, dm me your gt o I can add you later as the building crew
---
Good
---
Whoa...nice. My J25 UGL shreds but that is in part due to being 'magic.'
---
Sounds good! Just let me know when, so I can hop on that account!
---
I know, commas are hard.
---
Don't be condescending... Makes you look dumb AND mean.
---
It might be Unyielding Armor because it boosts all your stats at low health except for endurance. Serums can help too
---
A bit of grinding, yes. But I never buy anything from the Atom Shop. So I had like 4000 atoms saved up. I also acquired FO1st last month. So that was an extra 3000 atoms. I bought a whole bunch of ranks. Some people will say that that is not the way to go about the run, but I’m not spending my atoms on anything else.
---
That’s twice now that Grafton has been mentioned and my main quest line is wanting me to go up there so I guess I’m gonna take the plunge and hike up there.
---
Wait... who sells that? And how is it different than an MMG? I use the MMG as my primary weapon.
---
I have a hooked up non legendary handmade I picked up at one the power plant events that I use pretty frequently. I have over 550 legendary scrip that I could use but I hoard that to get at least one gun I’d actually use out of the multitude of things I’m just gonna turn in.
---
No, you can one shot them and they won't even have a chance to mutate.
---
I’ll try that. Thanks
---
That’s what I’m saying dude. Like I don’t doubt there is diminishing returns with this stuff but getting your dr high is still beneficial because I’ve experienced it! I know I’m not crazy, the higher my dr the more tanky I am even in the 500s it’s a pretty big difference. For low health builds especially stealth builds I can see where it’s not really a big deal because you’re one shotting anything before it touches you anyway, but for tanky full health builds it’s the difference of taking a lot of damage or not much at all. Toss the numbers out the window and all the math to come to the conclusion of diminishing returns, the result is the same which is higher dr means higher dr. Maybe I just need it explained better but I’m 100% with you, vanguards and bolstering armor is legit and it does help to become more tanky.
---
Yeh
---
There is also the western border river.
---
I mentioned this before, but if you could scrap specific effects as modules, and then have to buy a legendary plan for your chosen weapon, and then each specific effect module grants a 20% chance to get that effect.
---
For instance, let's say you want a weightless combat armor leg, to guarantee you get it, you have to buy the legendary combat armor leg plan, and scrap five legendaries with the weightless effect for five weightless legendary modules, and then you have a 100% chance to craft a weightless combat armor leg.

Just a way to keep the grind, but the light at the end of the tunnel is that you can get exactly what you want.
---
Or you could give up at three specific legendary modules, buy two, and have a 60% chance, if you're feeling lucky and/or impatient.
---
And if you want a specific three star, you'll have to find five EACH of the specific effect on a legendary (so a minimum of 15 legendaries) scrap them all (so no scrip) AND buy the legendary plans, with scrip (or gold, I guess)
---
I’ll take FFR over explosive every time. Better DPS without having to run explosive perks.
---
Can I ask why? I feel the lack of movement speed in sneak makes the fixer my go to.
---
It was completely different thing they fixed. It was the atoms disappearing or not registering when you earn them bug.
---
I'm done too and yes lots of xp grinding.  I was lucky enough to be in quarantine during 2x exp weekend and by the end of that weekend I went from just under 100 to the mid 240s and was at 80 on the run then I grinded to 86 ( during 2x score) then I'm not gonna lie I broke down and bought the rest with atoms.
---
I did this one I only ever seen it pop up once but it was a legendary scorchbeast but it was on the bottom of the cliff I had to run down there to shoot it only to have it teleport to the top of the cliff where the event started so if u end up doing this again just try to check down over the cliff
---
Fix your bum pc and quit whining over nothing
---
Oh no! I live in a world where being bad at video games is the worst thing! Whaaaaaa!
---
That’s what you sound like.
---
Oh, that sounds promising.
---
I've normally hit my scrip limit within 10 minutes of logging on after scripping the previous day's haul.  Won't be long before your doing the same.
---
The Atom shop is what does it. Atom shop and nuclear winter are the only two causes I've ever seen mentioned.
---
Basically don't leave nuclear winter as your last mode played and don't do anything until you log into an adventure server.
---
Patch 21 is on PTS, maybe you can log on and find out.
---
If you think you're gonna be playing this game every day for at least 4 hours then buy the year. Don't buy the monthly.
---
If you play this game 4 days each week and it's not your main game you hop on first then buy a month an skip a month an buy another when you feel like it.
---
The monthly fee is more expensive than the yearly sub if you are on the fence of maybe I won't be playing the game anymore in 4 months then 10 months pass an you've overpaid  by doing it month my month.
---
Well if you don't wanna do bloodied or junkies you probably want an anti-armour, instigating or vamps. With a normal gauss you'll probably be one shotting most things in the game. Instigating means you'll more than likely one shot most things. 
---
Junkies is very easy to do though if you do get a junkies gun
---
Damn well thanks for telling me that it just hasn't happened in awhile and I thought they fixed both so I thought it was fixed
---
It reminds me of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Trying to come up with a new fresh story while retaining everything that fans remember in the old movies (X-wings, tie fighters, rebels, stormtroopers, etc.)
---
I like the gatling plasma because I accumulate the plasma cores for free. I have to remind myself though not to use it on legendary scorchbeasts when they are flying.
---
Uncertain.  Based on earlier posts, it was a surprise when the rewards started to pop up at the beginning of The Legendary Run.  I had never touched NW prior and have acquired all the items as of last week just by playing for the daily challenges and some extra matches here and there if i die right away.  For reference, i got the final reward (Fur Lined Jacket and Jeans) right around Overseer rank 20-21 and i started at 0.
---
Yeah all to well...
---
Frustrated me alot last time...
---
Stairs and foundation option did not work..
---
Logged off...
---
Logged back in day  after, and probably solved itself
---
Why did you post this 5 times.
---
THANK YOU!
---
If you don't get a hit on a legendary enemy, while doing a public event, then you miss out on being able to loot it for a legendary drop.
---
3* legendaries drop 1-3* loot
---
2* legendaries drop 1-2* loot
---
1* legendaries only drop 1* loot
---
Some people intentionally kill legendaries before anyone else can get a hit on them, so only they get to loot for a legendary drop and everyone else is screwed out of it.
---
Hope that helped at all.
---
Why would anyone want wallpaper if you can't put them on all the walls anymore?! I was going to buy wallpaper until I realized I can't put them on the shutters
---
Use both. Explosive one when you need to kill alot of enemies fast, or tag things (by shooting next to them), and 25%ffr for bosses (queen etc) and generally when something (one target) needs to die fast.
---
Wait I did... I only hit post once.
---
My phone must be bugen out again
---
I don't know if you're aware but you're spamming this. Also give it a few minutes to see if the body spawns in. If not just server hop and it will give you a new NPC to go get it from.
---
Whitspring resort is your friend!!! With all the right xp buffs ( sleep, food, build team, chems for int. And lunchboxes). You can make a big loop around the resort killing the sentry bots for anywhere between 2k and 4k exp, and there is anywhere between 3 and 7 depending on the server. Plus there are lots of assultrons and random enemies that attack the robots.
---
That would explain my confusion, thank you.
---
Yeah  I have it. Bought it awhile ago.
---
Dunno, but I'm guessing it happened 5 times?
---
I only hit post once I don't know what happened?
---
If you play on a team and your teammates get a hit on the enemy, and you're in close enough proximity, then you get to loot it as well.
---
My character originally was presenting male but I switched him to female just recently when the Piper outfit was released. So... the gender part of the character ain’t really a thing. Heh.
---
I’m still waiting for the encapsulated scortchbeast heart to come back to the shop
---
It's really terrible haha. Kinda kills the whole set for me
---
Molotov grenades. No bodies flying all over no instant kill and also pretty fiiiiiiiire
---
This is going back a bit, but I'm pretty sure it's the settlers bullion vendor, don't remember his name. It's a power fist looking thing. No idea why I bought the plan, I've never even bothered to craft one. I probably should've done a little research beforehand 🤦‍♂️
---
The economy... think of the economy...
---
I play NW every day. I've never had a challenge autocomplete.
---
Touche'
---
Steeped Teas. With Herbivore, Strange in numbers you can stack a ton of amazing buffs!! Some of these require Pepper, Spices and Honey. I didn't list Brain Bombs here because in most cases Brain Fungus Soup is nearly as good and far easier to craft.

Yea, hopefully they fix it fast. If the bug is still around when season 2 starts i will propably quit the game for good. Seen too many bugs and glitches etc in this game from launch that are still around and not fixed.
---
Thanks, you've been super helpful
---
Ah maybe so. In that case mutation plus mod but i suspect he's already using armored mod
---
2 mutfruit 
---
4 tomato 
---
1 carrot 
---
4 random
---
Alright, I wasn't playing for a while. Probably when it came out...
---
Thank you! If you’re feeling extra patient... Clearly I am struggling, but WHERE is the settler’s gold vendor and how have I missed it?!
---
Lol everyone talking about shotguns and here I am using a harpoon gun with flechettes.
---
Mmmm. Slimy meats.
---
Fr they jusst need to fix their long list of bugs we had em since launch and get new ones every update..
---
Nope, still happens to a lot of people
---
Hey, sorry to disturb an old post. Would you happen to have similar info for Luck regarding Durability &amp; Condition of gear found in the wild? Thanks very much!
---
thats a hunting rifle. the 50cal is a heavy weapon
---
You don't need hacked, legacy or magic weapons to down her in a minute.  She can be killed in 2 seconds stealthed with stacked melee food/chem/drink buffs and a regular bloodied weapon.
---
A good stealth commando Fixer build could down her in under a minute solo.  [https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI](https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI)
---
My 1 star bloodied gatling plasma hits her for around 70 on the head without sneaking or anything too special.  6 players with bloodied builds that aren't even trying too hard could easily down her in a minute without her landing.
---
It's been totally worth it for me. I spent so much time juggling stash and carry weight that I was ruining my own experience because I feel like I have to pick up All The Things. Having unlimited junk has been game-changing. I'll go month-to-month until I'm done playing FO but I can't see going back to normal/free at this point.
---
Oh what a dick move. Thanks for filling me in
---
If you are near an instanced area go through it then exit. The body should spawn or the inventory will be lootable.
---
Give them the thumbs down, go Explosive bait their camp. Eventually if everyone does this, people will learn, don't one shot legendaries. 
---
It's annoying when they do it when you wave others over at an event and than one person runs over and one shots it before the rest people can come over. At that point you know they are just assholes.
---
I found an osmosis kit just laying on the ground months ago. Now I just say hello to the Ward and he gives me rewards.
---
One bug I actually like!!
---
Yeah for me its not about fighting enemies. I dont even jump during a fight (there is no need with game being so easy enemies just dont reach me) but more about traveling, navigating through locations, player camps and generally a world. I have visited almost all places in appalachia when i visit new location i dont just run through it or jump around like crazy but if im doing uranium fever or some daily for the hundred time  its just soo good to not walk around every obstacle.
---
Praise the truths
---
Did you mean to post this five times?
---
I have found that if you tag a high level creature like the grafton monster and then let the fire kill it later, it counts as your kill 👍
---
that seems like a bit of a non-sequitur
---
Make every legendary worth 5 scrip for each star. Make the daily scrip limit 1000.
---
I don’t know what Bethesda is afraid of. It’s not like you’re gonna get anything good from the purveyor. I would like my disappointment sped up instead of drawn out over the month.
---
Jetpack and SS torso.
---
My favorite item in the game. Hands down. Your mobility is through the roof with it.
---
The other suggestions are great too!!
---
No worries. He's usually right near the treasury note exchange machine, at foundation. He'll be kinda leaning up against a railing. Should be the only NPC near there. You may need a certain level of rep with the settlers before you have access to some of the plans though
---
This will never happen unless they release a version that can only be played offline with a character that can never be used online in any way.
---
I love community driven units👍. Its like Charlemagnes in total war.
---
Had a guy get pissed at me for killing fireflies and did this. Like comeone, man, there's not alot of XP and we all just want to get this event done so we get our XP boost.
---
If it's a plasma that doesn't shoot plasma, then it's a legacy Explosive legendary Plasma, and in theory there aren't many in circulation.
---
Their price recently went into free fall mode, so you should be able to get your hands on one reasonably enough if you want to get familiar with the trading scene.
---
No I don't know what happened I posted it from imager and got like 6 people saying it was posted multiple times I don't know what happened.
---
First time useing imager
---
Last time to
---
Same, but will probably vendor sell the armor rather than drop.
---
It's not you monster. Poor kid!
---
Same reason all those Teddy Bears and other "collectibles" aren't protected from being used for scrap by the game.
---
Bethesda half asses everything, that's why.
---
If you're maxed out you (5,000 bullion) won't get any more when you turn in treasury notes. Not sure if it will warn you or just pop up and say "max". I turned in my treasury notes last night and didn't realize I was already at 4900 so it just maxed me out and didn't give a warning that I didn't have enough room for it all (unlike the legendary scrip machine which will give a warning).
---
Can I jump in with "if you abandon the objective to kill a legendary, and then fail the event because everyone went for the legendary, you're an asshole"?
---
In theory they were duped to high hell.
---
I've never played NW, and I've played since Day 1.
---
I’m a big fan of the damage-increasing Psycho-based chems: Pyschotats and Psychobuff. You can craft Psychobuff (not sure how I got the recipe).
---
I have a couple legendaries do this to me everyday since the last patch. Just server hop and start again
---
I love this community but feel so bad sometimes. I started a new character just to level up quickly for SCORE and as I was spawning out of Vault 76 I heard the familiar sound of someone coming out of stealth with their suit. Turned around to see a level 200 waiting for new players. I knew they were going to be generous so I did what any normal player would do.... I panicked and ran and ran and ran and didn't look back lol.
---
They are hacked because explosive gatling plasmas never dropped naturally. And they are more than likely duped because they started being everywhere after that last dupe wave. If I had to guess, they're either Junkie's Explosive or Instigating Explosive gatling plasmas.
---
Any other gaming company, and i mean ANY other gaming company (from the smallest to the largest) would still consider this game to be in alpha state.
---
Ok thanks
---
same here. Happy I did it especially when I see NW dailies
---
Or at least be able to sell all those useless extra SS armor pieces for caps (to NPC's) but people could argue that if it was a thing, they'd be afraid to accidentally sell their godly items to any vendor.
---
Just use three 3* weapons and two 2* weapons
---
They're not doing what's called user acceptance testing.  It's some kind of scripted/programatic test they're running on files, like a data validation, but no one is writing tests that involve playing or checking things out from an end user perspective.
---
(-.(-.(-.-).-).-) the whole sub rn
---
I too have had success doing solo stealthy melee and get the Ninja perk (3x damage) to work.
---
I've tested Luck with PA but not weapon drops. Intelligence 100% doesn't affect Durability on anything crafted at all. I'll give it a try! I wouldn't really trust your tests as your punctuation is absolutely fucking absymal. (You can swear by the way, no need for *'s, you're not going to get your pocket money taken away. If you're going to call me names, do it like an adult please).
---
Junk decorating. Or add junk to the atom shop. I love cluttered old looking camps with some fallout campiness sprinkled in.
---
well you mostly want addictions that don't impact the specials you use
---
So int, charisma and luck. 
---
You need usually 5 of each chem you want to get addicted to. You can either pop 5 in a row real fats or alternate chems. i did the alternating method and had no problems. 
---
Here's the list 
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction) 
---
Alchohol and daytripper should be 2 of them. maybe psycho and buffout. not sure on 5th. If you're on xbone i have a drug mule with most drugs for like 20 caps
---
Explosive plasmas are on xbox and ps4. They are not hacked they are duped.
---
Med-X is also a good sub for psycho if you don't mind the -1 AGI vs -1 STR from psycho
---
Obtained plan very early when game official launched...
---
Learned and used on my pa...
---
Changed pa paint, few weeks later...
---
But cant change back to the paint, and not listed anymore...
---
The paint looking little Chrome..
---
Still have old picture from that time
---
My first roll was a 1-star Bloodied GM.  It took me dozens/hundreds to get a Bloodied Gauss Shotgun and full sets of Unyielding SS.
---
Does anyone know if Bethesda has plans to allow the floor linoleum to half and quarter floors? It drives me crazy that I can only use my patterns on the full floors. My settlement is up against a mountain so I have to be creative with my floors to keep it right up against the mountain as close as possible, but then all the edge pieces are brown. **UGH.**
---
Thank you! It must be the Raiders vendor I’m missing then, if they have one. I have found Samuel.
---
I only use vats like 30 percent of the time and the handmade is super steady while aiming but the fixer kicks like a mule. Also i don't really sneak around much. I just jetpack up to a vantage point and wipe everything out while crouching
---
Yea I was told the same thing....or people could pay attention to what they are doing....lol
---
Sorry i should been clearer. But that's what I use anyway as my main.
---
Don't do what I did and pay for the Prime Receiver or whatever because it turns out you won't be able to make ammo for them even though you're supposed to. But, even if you could make ammo for it, you won't want to because it requires SO MUCH stable flux to make less than one magazine's worth of ammo (*with* AmmoSmith and SuperDuper on), that you'll just hate yourself for wasting Gold on it. That is all.
---
No issues here. Tested with PA plus heavy weapon and a full secret service set plus heavy weapon.
---
if its always divisible by 5, you might as well divide your final numbers by 5 and make it 1 based, the extra 4 numbers aren't doing anything other than making you feel better
---
honestly, and don't take this the wrong way, I think it's just placebo. the damage formula is more or less the same as in Fo4 and that's how it works. basically, the difference between 0 and 100 dr is the same as 100 and 700 dr. say you're hit for 100 damage, with 100 dr you'd take 65 damage. so a reduction of 35 damage. but in order to reduce it by another 35, you'd need an extra **six hundred** dr.
---
200 dr like in your example is no small thing, it's 1/3 of the 600 I just mentioned. it does make a difference, albeit small. but in almost every case I can think of, you can use the perk points you wasted on ironclad and the legendary slot you wasted on bolstering, for something much more useful. like creature-specific effects in the case of legendaries.
---
a mixed set of zealot's, troubleshooter's, exterminator's, mutant and ghoul slayer's will net you a 15% flat reduction against almost every enemy type in the game. a *lot* more than what an extra 200 dr gives you. combine it with the healing from solar armor and overall you're taking far less damage than if you had 700 dr.
---
bolstering specifically is also a lot worse than vanguard's in my opinion, mainly because all the dr in the world wouldn't save you at 19% health.
---
and in regards to serendipity/PA, the best way to test it is with a lone sentry bot. if you have no qualms about phasing through walls, the one in vault 79 is great for this. otherwise there's one in 98 NAR near WS. you just have to kill the gutsies and eyebots around it.
---
test each (serendipity and PA) a dozen times and note the results. I've done it, and he absolutely mows me down with a full heavy combat uny/ap/sen set. some extra dr and er from mutations and perks, ricochet and serendipity. dodgy, too. I don't even have time to heal sometimes, when the rng decides to F me over. meanwhile I can comfortably tank his machine gun when I'm wearing SH with a similar setup. I have more than enough time to heal.
---
start another character and don't let it learn any other plans for ranged weapons besides the handmade, level this character up to 50 and use as your main scrip mule. Turn in scrip at Murm's. profit??
---
Depending on what gat plas you're finding you'll either get your hands on a regular gat plas or an legacy explosive gat plas *(be prepared to trade for these)*
---
With the recent **dupemas** the prices have fallen on legacy's but it doesn't mean they're not worth to nothing so maybe you'll find a deal
---
So you're under the impression that there would be two rounds of Fasnacht? The first in June and the other when the season started?
---
Naw, PS4 I’m afraid, lol.
---
Well she never died once, she didn’t have pacifist on and they destroyed her crops and her brahmin fertilizer. She didn’t die because she never attacked them.
---
Yeah think about all those people with alts full of godly items and legacies.
---
Lights -&gt; Lamp IIRC
---
Hacked? Uh oh we got a post legacy player here 😂
---
Depending on the roll for the E gat plas anything thing is good with your build I prefer a nice E furious gat plas ngl
---
It is worth it imho.
---
* private world, nukes, no rush to get the res for flux
---
* private world, no aggravation about one-shotters
---
* unlimited Stash, craft the ammo when you need it, not to store lead and steel
---
* 1600 atoms monthly, which is about $16
---
* Survival tent, got overloaded on junk? Just pop the tent and stash it.
---
If you can see yourself playing FO76 for at least 8 months, then go yearly. 8*15=120, and you have 4 months "free".
---
I only one shot things when other people decide to one shot things. I’m all about sharing the wealth, but when someone comes along and takes food (legendaries) out of my kids (legendary scrip machine) mouth, my paternal instincts kick in and adrenaline reigns true.
---
Bethesda needs to buff legendary enemies, ALL legendary enemies. So they can’t be one shot.
---
If you can get the line in the sand glitch to work I did that A LOT. Used a low powered explosive weapon to tag the group. Plus boosted XP from lunch boxes, well rested, canned meat stew, inspirational perk and building team. I had it to where I hit the 10k XP multiple times and even leveled up twice during it on occasion
---
This exactly. I use my BE15r for everything, but am on the hunt for a B2515r with prime reciever for the SBQ. Also i can make like 186 rounds per flux with the handmade vs 88 with the fixer
---
These players have neither the warmth or the depth.
---
Me too man, but I did it just normal. Overly confusing.
---
Think of the children
---
Same.  I just dumped a bunch of spare atoms.
---
Exploding plasma guns never dropped. Explosive gattling plasmas did.
---
thats what ive been trying for, prob crafted close to 50 plasma casters never got a single bloodied, but got a bloodied gauss pistol and bloodied gauss minigun on the first few rolls
---
Gutted lol no one on XB seems to sell ultracite ammo for decent prices anyway lol
---
Been playing junkies since lv 150 am 360 now personally I use alcohol, daddy-o, daytripper,formula p, mentants. This way it's -5 charisma -3 luck -1 per -1 agi -1 int. I find used to have phycho but prefer this instead.
---
What is your LMG? Is it a bloodied 25% faster firerate?
---
you can check my reply to radratsteak if you want a more detailed explanation. but realistically the difference is minimal:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i02q8u/am_i_doing_this_whole_tank_build_right/fznalxb/
---
yes it will tell you that it will replace your current pet
---
*meh* if that's what you want with the atoms then why not. I work a lot of hours and have been non-stop this whole year so I only get a little bit of grinding at night and weekends. 
---
I *know* I'll never be able to finish, but I'll see how far I get whether I want to use the atoms I've picked up along the way to go a bit further. Really the big wants for me were the raider gas mask, the gatling gun skin and the fireplace door...but they're all heavy loaded at the end so *shrug* I'll wait and see.
---
Would kill for a double score, or even an xp weekend again...a week or two of double score and I'd have a good chance at finishing.
---
I have mine set to "read only" and its always deleted upon boot of the game. Its very weird.
---
If they make it so u can change the stars then it needs to make it so they become untradible
---
Do a scan and repair from the Bethesda launcher.
---
Yes. This is why I bought it. I wanted camo colors for nw.
---
Raider vendors or Graham.  It's a chance to be in either inventory.  Not guaranteed.
---
Yo mean like you can't trade the item to other players if you change the stars?
---
I just threw some away. I've been getting them from workshop events but I don't suggest doing those without 1st.
---
It's worth it, just a pain to stockpile ammo.  Most of the ammo I've gotten for it comes from crafting the actual gun, you get 250 per craft.  Still chasing **any** bloody gauss minigun, got loads of everything else.
---
Pretty sure I got it randomly from doing events
---
The queen is immune to explosive damage
---
Yeah already got that and this was a good decision. Maybe I’ll do some research for the t-65 and get it as an collection item since I’m not a pa build tho
---
Ok yeah, makes sense. I'm maxed at both and haven't really bought anything other than secret service plans for some time now. Good luck!
---
No I was not and not sure why. Same perks unless he had some stealth on each armor piece
---
Bloodied Build full unyielding set and 20%health.  Helps if your INT is already pretty high (mine is 12).
---
Egg Head mutation + Herbivore + Stranger in Numbers
---
Cranberry Relish (25%) + Well Rested (5%) + 30-40 INT from Unyielding + the lighthouse mothman event (5%) + Lunchboxes (4 x 25%) 
---
Then grind events like a boss.  When people do the tent thing in Line in the Sand and have all the Scorched spawn in the middle, I can easily get 2K XP per wave.  Not to mention 1400 steel scrap.
---
Automatic Tesla Rifle and Tesla Coils on my Power Armor and playing non-bloodied, helps with tagging enemies, but unlikely to one-shot legendaries
---
I am the same way.  I got 29k caps and I got everything that I want with bullion.  I was farming scrip but then I got my last piece of Unyielding SS armor so I am done there.  Now I am just farming weapons.
---
I would suggest SS armor and then play the "What roll am I going to get when I made a piece of armor" game for a bit =)
---
They focused way too much on their stuff with scorched. If they are brought back, it would be great to see more of their “ anarchic “ side, especially with a Raleigh Clay and a Free States who lost a bunch of people from helping those who distrusted them
---
Amen brutha! 
---
And the content is random shit lol
---
They obviously don't even play this game anymore.
---
I've never seen a game company so detached from it's game and fans.
---
Half vertical walls, foundations and roofs would be great. Side snapping half width stairs. More junk in the atom shop.
---
Did you fail to load your character to the world when this happened?
---
Why is there a cap at all for these things anyway? If I have all the legendary weapons I am going to convert them to scrip eventually. Why force me to do that over multiple days instead of right away? It keeps me playing the game more I suppose but it sure as hell doesn't make it more enjoyable.   
---
If people want to spend hours grinding legendaries for scrip and get thousands a day, why does that matter? You can still limit how much they spend by having limited daily stock. The main advantage here being now we don't need to hold onto these heavy ass weapons and armour in our already limited stash. We can convert it to scrip whenever we want and that ways nothing.
---
I thought so too
---
White springs had a buggy high spawn rate for legendaries for the longest time, they patched that a long time ago or at least I thought. I know West Tek doesn't always spawn a legendary, I'm just saying in personal experiance it is a good place to farm. If you clear the whole place out you are likely to find at least one legendary in my personal experiance, sometimes 2. Its more about how many enemies that can be legendary and their general plausibility to be legendary. Ghouls and supermutanta are pretty plausible because of their numbers alone. West Tek just has a lot of enemies that can be cleared out quickly if you have a decently damaging build. More places I've had decent luck is with the Generals Steakhouse super mutants and Harpers Ferry when the supermurants or ghouls spawn there. You can also do the blood eagle checkpoints along the mountains dividing the map, they legendaries commonly spawn at them.
---
I guess what I was getting at really isn't that far from what you are getting at. If you are low level or nobody is doing Leader of the Pack hit it. If you are high level you have options, don't be a dick and steal it from a noob, sure you are right about that. But frankly, if you are low level and I'm doing it, I'm frankly not even going to get upset about it. Still really nothing to get upset about even if someone takes one though, in the end it's just a game, and the legendaries spawn elsewhere. But then again I don't really find it hard to find legendaries.
---
The map’s northern boundary has a ridge line above the Toxic Valley that provides some great views; there’s even a campsite with a chair so you can overlook the valley for a while.
---
Seriously, I just got my gauss shotgun and when I see a legendary I swap to my radium rifle, it’s not hard
---
They can't because it costs them money every time one of those songs plays. Its effectively real life radio. I would suggest checking out some of the fallout radio live streams on youtube. I like to have them playing while I'm irl hiking.
---
No, people were definitely more generous with my wife's character, which is technically an alt because it's on my account, but only she plays it.
---
The odd part is, when she gets on mic, people are surprised that she's actually a woman (my tag is the same as here, clearly has a man's name in it) and tend to leave her alone afterwards.
---
I think the scrip value should be half of what it costs to buy them or at least raise the limit to 160 so I can scrip four three-star garbage weapons in one go.
---
Lost home. south of watoga. It has a very frequent trader spawn. Whether they have the helmet.. well. I hopped several times this morning and they had the helmet once.
---
Also has 2 bobbleheads and 2 magazine spawns there
---
Sorry I am on XBox, anyone else though look me up later gamer Tag:   Send Me 4 I Am
---
Ooh yes you're so condescending and willing to get taking advantage of as a consumer, what a fucking clown
---
So I want to look for exploding furious gatling plasma.  Ok, well something to chase on the trade reddit I guess.
---
Would be cool if it was banked/rolled over to the next day.
---
FYI, Bethesda has no share holders. Its all on them.
---
Honestly I agree the music is getting old and now that we have a radio host she could say something like "Hey Appalachia I have good news, I found some mussic tapes in the closet so lets try them out!" That would just be a example but yes we need more music.
---
can't comment on int as I've never tested it. but luck does affect how big the bar is on dropped weapons at least. don't know about armor because the scorched in gauley mine where I tested this don't drop armor as often as they do guns.
---
&gt;I'll give it a try!
---
good, at least that's more productive than being a \* online.
---
&gt;You can swear by the way
---
I don't trust the automod shadowing my comments.
---
I run bloodied, and so far i javent experienced this glitch. Atleast not that im aware of
---
Sorry I didn't read your post closer,  I have a knack for that. Lol
---
I bought the dynamite and dynamite bundle and like them. Cheap to craft. I think its 1 adhesive, fertilizer,  and oil per. Stronger than frags too.
---
Np good luck selling it! If you do decide to keep it captainoob on YT has made a great video about it. Looks seriously underrated imo
---
That's crazy. Wow. 
---
I don't do a bloodied build (my luck would never allow me to get the unyielding/bloodied equip for one LOL) so my stats will never get that high, but that's a lot of XP fast.
---
I believe the war rider power armor skin has the same problem.
---
New Gad lake!!
---
Oh, forgot to say - hope the quarantine came out okay and you're healthy!
---
“Magic weapons” are what players use to melt the queen, Angry Turtle on YouTube has videos explaining it well but basically certain perks bug out damage on guns with fire rate &gt;200
---
Depends on your build the main are bloodied/junkie 
---
Then the other prefixes for weapons for whatever you build is
---
Lol no problem maybe I’ll get them too sound fun and cheap but I always run around with like 20 plasma grenades😅
---
Why do you feel guilty for people thanking you for doing something nice?
---
Maybe it's because I pick my targets off the map, based on level, and don't know what their toon looks like until I get there, but I don't think it matters what the sex of the player or the character is.
---
Nice is nice.
---
Now serving 1,000,001
---
Because this whole thing started when they claimed they fixed a bug that caused challenges to autocomplete if you played NW before going into Adventure mode
---
If you're on pc I can give you one. I have a few
---
And I would actually play more. Now I just log in. Do my daily check list an log off.
---
Same!: I always drop stuff off there as well.
---
To be fair the card for Serendipity is an animation of the Vault boy just dodging bullets n shit
---
I just want, big bad John. With how prevent mining is I think it'd fit the vibe perfectly
---
Because Bethesda is way more smarter than  us.
---
I would not doubt it for a second
---
At first it said something about my account not being found or authorized and kept doing that. Once it finally let me on it auto completed all but the nuclear winter challenge.
---
I'm pretty sure I have this in my vendor. I'm on Xbox. I'll be online in about 1.5 hrs if you still need it
---
Oh yes, it said something like incorrect access code, nuclear keycard is erased for security purposes, please enter a new key card.
---
Is it in a place that easily accessible to both new players and high level?
---
TIL... I guess they have even less excuses.
---
The bundle is more spendy but not bad. 
---
I love the armco ammo machine from Crater too. 200 .556 rounds everytime I head to camp. Definitely worth the price.
---
so that you subscribe to Fallout 1st(tm)
---
for real, as a digital artist, this is ridiculous. 5 dollars for a color change is insane, and they should feel great shame
---
Explosives including legacies are not good vs sbq.  If ppl are melting her with energy weapons it's likely magic weapons not legacies.
---
Beautiful
---
This one player would use the “follow me” emote to alert everyone of the legendary before we kill it and I’ve been doing it ever since
---
No interest in joining a public team?
---
Yes it’s worth it, but it’s hard to justify giving Bethesda money on a monthly basis when they don’t fix there fucking game!
---
yep
---
Thanks. I’ve never crafted myself a jet pack, I’ve always been happy with the marsupial mutation. When I was a low level I loved getting to the top of a building and sniping whatever was below me. You’ve got me wanting to get back into it again.
---
there's little reason to use wood armor. shrouded doesn't work and escape artist/muffled all but completely negate the negative effects of armor weight.
---
it's a great piece nonetheless.
---
Sure love it I use it to craft .45 for my holy grail ;)
---
I'm a software engineer and there is literally no reason for me to test my software if I have people actually PAYING me to test it for me (Fallout 1st)
---
I have all the songs from each Fallout game downloaded and on a playlist, I could easily do that. But I'd like to listen to them on the in game radio.
---
Ya, nice location. Its the lake bed north of Charleston.  Still in the forest region but still somewhat centrally located. A few resource nodes available too. Definitely scout it out!! Good luck!!
---
I figured with 2 Tennessee Eric Ford songs they would have more of his. Also I feel like there is a lot they cab do with the radios.
---
Add some quests for the new host 
---
Add Appalachia radio(no host) 
---
MORE SONGS
---
However like everyone will say licensing is such a damn issue. I think that some of the songs they used to use had their digital rights get bought out or soemthing. So if you have any music you want on it try and find out the information on the digital purchasing rights. There is also a spotify playlist for it that I have heard about.
---
Edit: woops Tennessee Ernie Ford
---
It's not like they don't have money from micro transactions and Fallout 1st
---
Off topic, I'm sorry, but how are Fallout First members neglected?
---
Is it not that all humanity, nay, all life, are alts of each other all going back to that initial single cell?
---
Is there a magic gat plasma?
---
Keep in mind junkies counts addictions, not withdrawal effects, so find a drug that you'll use often (like psycho or calmex) so you'll only suffer 4 debuffs instead of 5.
---
Yeah it is nice. I would still say check out the streams. They do like fallout news, commercials, and other fallout stuff. I miss the radio from New Vegas who would call you out as you did shit.
---
I have a level 52 mule that I Ieveled up completely in NW. They have only ever learned the handmade and fixer plans. You'd still be surprised at the shit I roll...
---
They had 3 twitch prime packs last year and haven't come out with any new ones this year. The last one I think included Nuka cola pain for the combat armor.
---
Your rifle will not do the same damage in PvP as the damage against other players is capped at 110. Based on your build you should be hitting that 110 already, so find a fast fire rate gun to maximise your DPS
---
Really love the look but that poop shoot really ruins it for me.
---
I was at line in the sand when it was bugged and the mobs spawn in the court yard. I was getting frustrated not getting much xp from my fixer. I remembered I had the explosive effect on another gun and used it to just shoot wildly at the ground.
---
I had this on xbox yesterday I just restarted the game
---
I dont think we will ever fix this issue.  There is always one gumby who's going to do it.  I don't bother with the legendary enemies anymore I just help out and collect the treasury notes.
---
If u have speed demon on uralready going the fast sneak speed u  can btw.
---
I think this whole problem is still connected to people leaving the game from NW. You must start and finish your f76 session in adventure.
---
This is further proven by the fact that the issue exploded with the season,when free stuff attracted everyone,more than the atom challenges,that many where skipping. I think a lot of those people lost a ton of atom challenges without realizing because they didn't care. But now that they do care,they're losing challenges for the same behaviour.
---
The one time I've fallen in I didn't have a marker showing it, I kinda figured the fissure destroyed my junk and moved on.
---
shrouded doesn't work? well that's a shame. I still like low armor weight even if it doesnt affect stealth, simply because my character has like 0 strength with me puttin no points in it on top of my mutations, so having extra carry weight is always nice regardless
---
That’s not what the argument was about but sure
---
Personally I think you should be able to buy legendary modules with Caps. You can’t trade the legendary items you make from them so it wouldn’t ruin the market. Also it feels like the Cap economy is broken right now. No one wants to trade good gear for Caps anymore, and you can only really buy so many things with them. 
---
Maybe it’s just me, but I’ve been stuck at 20k+ caps forever so I can only keep my machines on like an hour until I get too close to 30 and have to shut them down again.
---
☹️ that stinks
---
Yeah I loved how they would comment on the in-game events. They even used some songs from Fallout 3 and New Vegas, they should bring some more over from New Vegas.
---
Furious, junkies, bloodied, zealots and anti armor are all decent rolls. Prime it and it will be a nice gun for the Queen. Faster fire rate, aim damage and explosive are all good secondary effects.
---
Thanks, I will
---
 And how do I get the responder thing next to my name like yours?
---
Always just people doing it for the buff, spread across the map
---
I had a nicely outfitted level 25 in my camp the other day. I was so excited to finally have a low level drop by!  I don't care if they're an alt or a mule. My main's camp is near V76 and I try to keep some cheap plans, purified water, and prewar food in my machines in case they need it. Alts still need purified water, some stimpacks, and a heart emote just like the rest of us :') It makes me think back to when I was a low level on my main and a PA player in the triple digits helped me with the Morgantown Supply Drop event and then left me a bunch of supplies that I was running *desperately* short on. ...doesn't hurt that it *also* lightened my inventory, haha.
---
I have a friend. She's my irl friend, so i dump stuff in the train station in a private world and she hangs out there while i exit and return with the other character and collect my stuff.
---
If we didn't have private worlds i would just give her the things to hold in case of server crash or something.
---
Aw dang. Thanks for the info though!
---
This will be the post that stops them, I just know it.
---
Spreading blame around to include the player base?
---
This is my take too. If a couple of them played thos game seriously so much would be different.
---
Go back to the main FO76 page and tap the 3 dots in the top right. Then select flair!!
---
Once has a SBQ get stuck in the fissure. Now that REALLLLLY sucked, I didn't get her body to stalk me with fast traveling near her either 🙃
---
Ive always been afraud of runnin a bloodied build, maybe ill look into a junkie build.  Thanks for your help wastelander!
---
Totally agree with you!  I actually had that thought after I posted this.  I kind of want to put them all over the place.
---
So you’re telling me that I can’t have one of each and run a rescue?
---
HaHa you made me laugh with the * again hehe. Okay thanks very much, I will test this. One question I have for you though: Do you think it's a possibility that you're seeing higher durability, as you levelled up, because the weapons had better/more/different mods pre-attached? I'm also pondering if PA is different, but i doubt that, should be the same effect across the board. Thanks again, sorry for being blunt and a grump earlier!
---
I'd be able to get my lever action mods finally xD can't find regular ones to save my life yet the legendaries fall from the sky like rain ;___;
---
Look at the roadmap and tell me what % of it is still in the game/was ever released or was released on time.
---
Its good to take a step back and compare it with other games.
---
Look at Path of Exile, a free game with huge content updates every 3 months. Its been going solid for 7 years and they announced Path of Exile 2 to come out sometime next year.
---
Not only you'll still have Poe1 to play, you can choose which "campaign" you wanna play, poe1 or 2. You get to keep all your cosmetics in poe2 from poe1 AND you can play with players from poe1 if you pick poe2. Its great.
---
Compared to this, what has bethesda done? Roll on the floor and have a panic attack?
---
Sorry, I thought I had commented it directly under the other dude's comment, didn't mean to direct it to you °-°
---
Thank you! This sounds right up my alley!
---
That’s one of few I’m not running right now. But I might since you mentioned it. It would make my handmade more viable in sneak also, right?
---
For picking up an item? where is the logic in that? its ok I guess.. i just play on game pass so id just make a new account if I actually bought the game but that is truly crazy that they are so against players and their own fan base. sound slike some pro commie asshats running the show.
---
That...is definitely worse 😤
---
Best non bloodied/junkie prefixes are Antiarmor and furious and it works well with legacy weapons
---
That’s some great advice, nice to know we can tag like in adventure mode. Thanks mate!
---
Im pretty sick of the gay pride shit in video games in general and 76 is full of it, that goes along with the BLM bullshit.
---
Thanks for the intel!
---
They have to pay for any new songs, so I doubt that will happen for a while. Thought there was gonna be more with Wastelanders myself.
---
 If we didn't get any new ones with the update that introduced a DJ, I really don't think we'll get anymore. Maybe if we ever get to do some quests for her? 
---
I could see them shelling out for Spank, the group that did Country Roads and Ring of Fire again though. Those are easily the most popular songs on the radio and they fit the vibe pretty easily
---
How much ammo is too much ammo?
---
Hehe I will let u know when I find out! 🍺
---
1 cap is what people pay.
---
You also need 1000's of rounds to have an ammo business. 
---
You are better off farming the materials than buying and marking it up.
---
I don’t think having more databases is the solution.
---
It’s been happening for about a week now, and I’ve tried almost everything except redownloading the game
---
I’m sure they’re rolling in the cash after such a successful launch and continued growth. ...oh wait, the game had a horrible start, they’ve been hemorrhaging players left and right due to lack of content, people aren’t maintaining their subscriptions month after month (I know I took a few months break on the subscription while I took a break from the game), and likely all contributing to less atom shop purchases as a whole. 
---
Everything they do looks like a desperate attempt  to meet a financial metric put on their heads by upper management in Bethesda before they decide to just milk whatever cash left they can get out of it, before they move the money they spend on this game into another IP that will have a better ROI
---
Licensing costs are going to prevent that.  Any covers (like Ring of Fire and Country Roads are) are cheaper. Sometimes Record Labels and Estates (because let's face it, very few of the original artists for these songs are still alive aside from the Beach Boys and Copilot/Spank) see relative success and they want more money for the next licensing renewal OR for any further songs.  
---
I'd like to see more music added, too, but I don't think it's going to happen. (I was fucking thrilled when they added Ring of Fire because it was new and different.)  
---
Hell, I'd like an instrumental Bluegrass station, kind of like the Minuteman Radio had the Violin pieces (that were very fitting with the Boston setting and Colonial theming).
---
no. they fixed shadowed for all armor types (previously it only worked with leather) but forgot shrouded. the speed bonus does work I think, but speed demon already caps your movement speed at max.
---
they also forgot to enable muffled for arm pieces. currently only robot can have muffled arms. you can find arm pieces with the muffled mod already attached, but you can't install it yourself.
---
As someone who wondered the same thing for a bit,  you really just have to hit the limit like once to see how "flawed" it is. 
---
1000k cap max scrip plus 150 sellable. 
---
Let's say you buy 3 3 star weapons and you don't like any of them. So you sell them back for 140 scrip. Youre now back at 840/850 scrip. Plus ten sellable if you have extra one star weapons to sell.
---
You can buy 8 legendary weapons but then you run into two issues that are particularly bad even if you play daily. 
---
1 storage space, god forbid you get heavy guns that aren't weightless but still useless. You gotta wait till tomorrow to sell em.
---
2. Even if you waited a day to sell em back and get another 140 scrip,  you're "limited" to rinse and repeat just about every day. So you have to keep waiting a day to buy and sell. 
---
There are extra issues like.
---
3. It's already rng, but now it's literally irl time gated rng so it works against you. Its just just making it harder for you to grind something already rare. 
---
4. There are many duped items. This adds insult to injury especially because a little while ago bethesda unbanned a bit of players who had inventory of them and let them keep inventory.  
---
This is just a salt in the wound for legit players trying to grind the rng.
---
It is one of the easiest ones. You have one week to do it and even without shotgun you can do it in 5-10mins. Just hold down you crit button (space on PC) and shoot away in vats. I can't understand why people complain about this challenge :D No offence to OP.
---
FO76 endgame: log off and do something else.
---
I have 2 instigating handmades, neither are wxplosive though, I got my furious explosive 25 reduced vats from the encrypted event, if you interested i have onr of the instigating ones in my vendor, I will be playing after 6 pm Pacific time today, psn is same as on here.
---
Red Rocket Megastop is a really cool location imo
---
I got one as a random event drop (possibly Powering Up Monongah or the Messenger, not sure) and sold it recently. They also show up in vendor inventories.
---
This game is made of bugs
---
Yes it makes it the fastest u can sneak with anything when u have speed demon yes.
---
I know :/
---
Yes but the "good" double resource nodes are often occupied and it makes it difficult to place your camp without server hopping again. I used to camp the junk/lead node south of the Crashed Space Station before it became a popular camp location and even still I'd only be able to place my camp 1 in 4 times. It was a sweet spot but the frustration of loading in and loading back in was real. Not doggin' on the double resource camps, just saying you gotta want it if you want to stay.
---
Yep, bash em a couple times then get it to run after you while you move towards the crowd.
---
Have you tried unadding them and then adding them?
---
I swear they add new insults each patch, I’ve gotten 2 lately I’ve never heard before.  
---
I have never intentionally shot the insult bot, and let out a loud “fuuuuuck” when he gets me, which brings some laughs when I’m in a chat.  I love that he’s solid gold now, just like his insults.
---
I has find one every so often. Last night though, there were four like that in the burrows
---
Same as with any other ranged weapon. One with 25% faster fire rate (bloodied being the best ofc). Queen is nearly immune to explosive damage.
---
They never said it was fixed
---
Wow, my bad. Thanks for the day votes. I was referring to the treasury notes. And I had 710 bullion, turned in 20 notes and still have 710 bullion. Not close to 5000 yet
---
Workshops
---
They learned to be greedy assholes from Bethesda.
---
Ya got it!!
---
If you're at max you lose it. Not sure about if you havnt finished the quest line. But I think you get it, just can't use it
---
I waited until I completed the questline before I claimed those rewards. No sense in tempting fate.
---
I submitted a ticket long ago suggesting the limit be raised to 240 because it's divisible evenly by all but 2* armor. Now that we can craft our own legendary armor and weapons, we need it more than ever.
---
Just got it from Uranium Fever I believe.  It was on my alt character.  I was surprised to open up my inventory and see it in there.  Pretty cool looking - gives "Gramps" some style\\
---
 https://imgur.com/lm24JYN
---
If you are at max then you lose it.  I have max bullion and lost mine.
---
As for the quest line.  That I don't know.
---
Technically you can, with an Atomic Shop skin but you receive no Scrap materials.
---
Stealth works just fine. Never had any issues with it solo or grouped, private or public.
---
Rule 10.
---
The only time Nocturnal comes in handy is with my Powerfist. I have two. One for Daytime. One for Nighttime. The only reason it's even remotely useful is because they're both 90% weight reduction, so even both combined don't weigh as much as a single one. I just put on the heated nocturnal at night and puncturing furious during the day.
---
A lot of times the high damage is actually coming from a melee player. A group I play with runs 15-30 queens per day. My main character can hit her for 10k damage per swing, and I’m mediocre compared to some guys in our discord. A couple of our members land 20-30k per hit.
---
LOL...probably
---
A competent db admin would not have to set up additional databases to allow for this. A single enum field on the existing table should do the trick. The problem is the data return and transmission. Sending data across the wire is the slowest thing you can do in computing, and at all times you want to limit the volume of it as much as possible.
---
EDIT: Slightly more technical.
---
Currently on the server side a stash lookup will be something like this in SQL
---
    SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE playerid = :player
---
That fetches everything.  Add a field and this becomes
---
    SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE playerid = :player AND type = "stash"
---
That would return the stash, and the data lookup accordingly. Note that the first query would still be used to do the lookup of inventory while at your own camp.  Meanwhile a visiting player would do lookups only when interacting with the containers.
---
!karma
---
Yeah feared the max level option.
---
Will try claiming the gold on a toon that hasn’t finished it and will see what happens.
---
Bloody faster fire rate faster reload gatling plasma.  Literally melts her face off and out performs every other gun in my inventory including my bloody explosive faster reload gatling plasma as she is effectively immune to explosive effects.  If I'm left alone and she stays on the ground I can have her dead in less than 3 minutes solo.
---
Only thing I have seen that legitimately outperforms it is an unarmed melee build.
---
"Magic" weapons as detailed by angry turtles videos out perform it but it's a glitch and they will be adressed in a future patch I'm sure.
---
I'm a bloody nerd rage heavy weapons and demolitions spec.  I do use power armor, I know its unpopular but with heavy weapons 3/3 stabalized is life bro.
---
I have a combat vampire's shotgun with 50% limb damage. The thing is a beast when VATS cooperates.
---
Thank you. I’ve got some crafting to do when I get on next. 800 hours in and I guess there’s still some fine tuning to do on my build.
---
There's about a 33k score difference between all the dailies/weeklies combined, and the max needed to get to Rank 100, so hopefully you'll still be able to get there! Best of luck!
---
Thank you for this detailed reply, really. It does make more sense to me, but what is there to back up that math? And I’m not foolishly trying to disprove anyone or anything on this matter as it’s apparent that I’m a little ignorant on these diminished returns up until your detailed explanation, but if it’s a placebo how is it so noticeable? Is the extra 11/12 reduction of damage from that extra 200 dr really making me more tanky? Because I’ve switched from 500s to 300s so many times because of this reason and every single time I notice how much more damage I’m able to take almost immediately. I’ve never ran tests like you have to really see the difference, but if it is just my brain tricking me then I am absolutely insane because it really is noticeable and not just to me but to a whole bunch of other players as well, and some of them will swear by vanguards and bolstering. Both sides seem fishy to me, idk what to believe😂
---
Adding a new field will also create more lag...
---
True. Any other gaming company would consider fallout76 to be in alpha state.
---
Get the communist collectron. It drops blood packs. With chemist, each blood pack equals 2 stimpaks. Add in Super Duper and you end up with lots of stimpaks. You can also usually buy them for 20 caps at player vending.
---
Same error with the Prime skins. T65 does not work well with visors...
---
The flashlight comes from the right leg if you apply a visor skin.
---
don't wanna be doom &amp; gloom, but do you really think we'll see substantial additional content for the Enclave, or other groups? Real question, as I've only been playing for a few months, don't have the best read on what to expect going forward.
---
(I'd honestly like to see paid expansions a la Destiny)
---
Everyone who has it is going to tell you yes its worth it and the people who don't are probably going to tell you no. 
---
I'm going to go a slightly different route and tell you that you should wait to buy fallout first. There are many bugs/things just wrong with the game. If you don't mind giving money to them even though the quality control is lacking then you do get some decent benefits from paying for membership.
---
I run a melee on my other char...I have no idea how you hit that number.
---
?
---
like even if one star armor pieces are 2.5 instead of 3, it would help my scripocd(2*=8 so 5 would be 4, but make 3* 20 or 25 screw 24 lol
---
I also have first and had a bunch saved and I was tired of grinding and was only a 1/3ed of the way there
---
I claimed my gold rewards without completing the quest line. Nothing wrong happened. Got my gold without any problems.
---
correct
---
Wow thx so much :), nice info
---
I still know I grinded my Mr Fuzzy outfit, rip
---
Oh cool, thanks
---
xbox ps4 or pc?
---
I think a more balanced approach would be combining legendary weapons. Say I have a three star handmade with explosive, two shot and +1 agility as well as a one star handmade with bloodied. With this system I'd be able to trade out one of the legendary effects from the three star with the bloodied from the one star. They could also restrict it so you can only change one slot on legendaries and the other slots get locked. The weapons would also need to be the same so you can't just get a bloodied pipe gun and put it on an explosive handmade.
---
But how would they keep producing their world famous bugs if they started minimizing the layers and moving parts.
---
As a software developer I know over complicating things is the best way to get the bugs I need.
---
That totally sucks and is what I am worried about.  Another reason we need to have the option of locking items in our stash boxes so they will never get deconstructed.  How come ESO can do that but not Fallout 76?  It's the same company (probably different devs).  Learn from your other games Beth.
---
You sound exactly like what I want to build my friend.  Would you mind telling me your perk list, roll list ect that makes you...as awesome as you are?
---
I ended up binding diluteds to the - key on my favourites bar because of this. Wish it didn't reset in the rare cases I run out of them, though.
---
And then you end up scrapping your weapons/armor by mistake, i know i did it already with a weapon that wasn't legendary xD
---
I've been playing since beta and I've yet to have this happen to me on xbox. I didn't realize it's as big of a problem as reddit makes it out to be. I'm actually kind of curious to see it happen.
---
I turn a lot off, especially the hissing, dead air ones. Hissing dead air creeps me out.
---
Local man wants to nuke China so bad, engineers 2nd apocalypse to enable automated system to unlock nukes.
---
I was genuinely dumbfounded when I learned that that's the story behind the Scorchbeasts &amp; whatnot.
---
Yup. Got my three star rolling pin from a 3 star legendary robobrain (horde) today. Good times.
---
Wow that’s cool!
---
Because for every few scrip you miss out on that's a few more you need to grind the next day. It's like losing few dollars from your wallet every day. It might not break the bank, but it adds up over time to cost you more time.
---
Thanks a lot 😁
---
Ok. Yea I like that. It would reduce the time consuming scrip grinding and rng but still make you have to work for it.
---
How about they just don't give us a max per day...even just for a weekend event... The all you can scrip buffet...
---
I'm not really sure what that have in common to my comment?!?!
---
You get endurance from Exploration team. Endurance does not give extra AP, agility does. Endurance only lowers the AP drain when you are sprinting, it does not affect AP cost when shooting in vats.
---
DJ_DookieFumes is my tag
---
Not even sure why people are upset about this. Shielded casual gives 3 int, which is like the best stat now since it helps accumulate levels for legendary perks and score.
---
I’m a bloodied build. I use iron fist, incisor, martial artist, sneak, nerd rage, etc. Food is the next step. Before the nuke drops, I eat what I have of the following: Stingwing meat, Mutant hound meat, Deathclaw steak, Mole rat meat, Glowing meat steak, Sheepsquatch meat, and drink a Whiskey. I pop a fury once she is in the air. That pushes me up to around 4k. Nukashine brings me over 10k.
---
I haven’t finished the quest line, but did claim the Gold Bar reward yesterday. Some info about the Gold Bar popped up on my screen (Usage, treasure map.. something, something ... i don’t recall). So I guess it’s OK?
---
Ugh yes, also the assholes who one-shot the robots in Encryptid and the ghouls in Radiation Rumble !
---
Accurate
---
In soviet Russia, the legendary scrips you!
---
If it's about the stable flux... That disappears when you die in the event zone, no one took it.
---
Agreed. I wish you could remap the quick use button,   it would be great to be able to choose what aid item is used here. Or even set our own "priority list" like you mentioned. 
---
An example would be diluted rad away if you are a ghoulish build, you can always rely on rads healing you but have to enter the pipboy to use rad away. 
---
Another could be a damage boosting Chem like psychobuff or Fury. Yea you can use the favorites wheel, which I do presently, but it would be nice to not use the wheel as often when I want a damage boost or to stack chems.
---
Another example is a cola nut/rejuvenated build. I'd like to map the nuka to the simpack button. I have tons of nuka cherry in my backstock which are essentially stimpacks but they are such a PINA to use as stims from the favorites wheel. They work great in his build, just hard to actually use.
---
Yeah some fucking guy took my fluxes and I’m seriously pissed about it
---
Server hooping patched?  So u get a fresh server with everything in it??
---
I mean.. you make it sound like they're *all* unintentional. 🤷‍♂️ Bethesda Bugs are a marketable meme. I doubt we will *ever* see them produce a game without bugs, and that will always be a choice they have actively made.
---
Especially if they're working at Bethesda...that's cruelty of a new level.
---
Make Floater Grenades worth one scrip.
---
We can't sell them or trade them, because they're bullion items, but they're dropping as rewards.  Rather than force people to use them, just to get them out of their inventory, why not make them worth a scrip each?   It'd make the scrip transactions smoother, and it'd be optional if you don't want to do it that way.
---
Now, you might say, but won't that mean people will just be able to make scrip?  Sure.  But so what?  They'd still be limited by the same 150/day as everyone else.  If someone wants to get their scrip by killing a ridiculous number of floaters each day instead of hunting legendaries or doing events, more power to 'em.
---
Played since B.E.T.A. and never touched NW until The Legendary Run started. I hate PVP, and especially Battle Royales.
---
Since then I exclusively hid in bushes, only ever killing someone in self defense (AKA you stumbled on my bush and started punching me so I punched back).
---
Hit Rank 100 Yesterday, ended up with 14 Player kills total, got the Hellfire Armor, and don't plan on ever touching it again except for SCORE or Seasonal unlocks.
---
Oooohh was it nocturnal?
---
What’s sever hooping?
---
I just assume they’re thinking I’m giving them stuff because they’re female. It’s an illogical assumption, it just happens naturally for me, haha
---
Hopping misspelled. Is that what your asking??
---
If you haven't checked, the Chemist's Backpack Mod.  Reduces the weight of Drugs by 90%.  Saves you 3 points in Traveling Pharmacy.
---
Switch the walls back to normal put the wallpaper on and switch it to shutters
---
How many songs are there? 
---
They should add all new Vegas music
---
Wait till you get a good roll, then realize 2mm EC ammo is an absolute nightmare. Prime 2mm EC which is actually more efficient is even more of a fucking nightmare to farm. Then realize that a single piece of that ammo weighs 0.04.
---
I would enjoy a community event (much like the upcoming BOS event) where the more holotapes we bring to the DJ the music expands.  I would also like to bring her the Nuka Cola she keeps asking about
---
She could be a 300 lb dude from Detroit... named Chuck!
---
Yeah more covers would be excellent. I thought the same thing about Wastelanders.
---
it's all fun and games until your comments stop showing. or you stop getting notifications from the other party because they're swearing every three words.
---
pretty sure it's not mods. at level 1~5, 5~10 and 10~15, most weapons they drop are pretty standard. back when I tested it, I only leveled luck for the first 15 levels. and since I was using whatever they dropped, I was actively looking for the pipe weapons and pump shotguns with the largest durability bar.
---
I set up camp right outside the mine and would compare dozens of pipe revolvers, all with standard mods, after each run. and what I noticed was that, the higher my level/my luck, the larger the durability bar. I did this several dozens of times.
---
I couldn't seem to roll a pipe revolver with better durability until I leveled up/leveled my luck. noting that the scorched were the same level. until I hit level ~10 that is, then higher level ones started spawning with higher level pipe revolvers. which obviously had an even larger durability bar.
---
but the same thing still applied for the next 5 levels: I rolled dozens of revolvers as I grinded through the mine, but never rolled one with better durability than the best one. and it wasn't a small sample, either. then I leveled up/leveled my luck once and right off the bat I'd get a better one. several, actually. one better than other.
---
That doesn’t need patching. It’s the game. If u want a fresh server get first. In normal servers u get added to a live one. Sometimes stuffs gone. Sometimes it’s not
---
I like to imagine that the knobs on the radio are nipples. So i twist them.
---
I have yes, they’re not even appearing offline. They’re gone from my list entirely
---
That ain't working. That's the way you do it. Money for nothin' and your chicks for free....
---
Sweet beejeezus.  I didnt know food stacked.
---
Yeah it would be really nice to have a quest for her much like Three Dog in FO3 and Travis in FO4.
---
This. I'm hoping for this riiiiight here.
---
I think the guy who decided the scrip pricing scheme was also the guy that designed the Ammo Converter UI, added Frog Legs to Nuclear Winter, and created the green "item cannot be placed" CAMP notification.
---
Herd mentality I would say for underrated but it is gaining popularity with the addition of public teams. 
---
For overrated my vote goes to speed demon. I currently have a character that doesn’t use it. I can notice a slight speed difference but overall it has no major impact on my play sessions. It glitches out frequently when it comes to reload speed on your weapons so not having it eliminates that and I feel like it makes the perk card ground pounder worth while since I hip fire mostly.
---
Jesus. I've been "playing" since release and I only broke 100 recently thanks to the Double XP on a single character and haven't even fathomed an Alt yet.
---
I'm curious if it shows up on your Collections tab in the pipboy?
---
That's fair enough...I was worried there was obvious route to gaining score that I had missed :-)
---
edited for stupid writing.
---
Reminds me of the alternate meaning of MMORPG, "Mostly Men Online Roleplaying Girls"\*
---
\*myself included. I just like the female character model more than the male model. For some reason the male model looks like Bibendum's chunky cousin is many  of the armor types.
---
Appreciate this bud, I'm travelling home at the moment so will read more thoroughly later. I assume you used the mine as the enemies will scale to you, rather than in the open world Forest areas?
---
Sure.  Bloody heavy weapons are simple.  9/9 heavy weapons.  3/3 nerd rage.  3/3 stabilized. 1/3 tenderizer (the other two levels are meh cause they only give you 2% more damage)  and adrenal mutation.  That's it.
---
If you aren't running the queen one gun army is pretty nice but not necessary.  I NEVER use one gun army on the queen cause staggering her in air makes her reset her phases and she wont land.
---
My gatling is primed.  This is also important.
---
Edit: I hear a lot of guys like the str perk that increases armor while wielding a heavy weapon but I am 508, I always am the highest level at the queen so I end up face tanking her.  Blocker is godly in this scenario.
---
You want more of the same. I’m ok with change. Personally I liked the original game pre human NPCs. They told a really interesting story through discovery
---
You know, I didn’t check. But I will, when I log on next..
---
I agree.  I had some guys help me out a lot when I first started to learn how to play and actually make a build.  During the craziness a few weeks ago I made a bunch of trades until I was able to present each of them with their dream weapons as a thank you.
---
Thats why you should pay attention lol. Change the name...add it to your favs...if you do that it will ask you "are you sure"...
---
That’s great man good on you
---
Don't they outright admit to stealing it when you talk to them, though? "We need it more than they do?" Or am i thinking of different quests?
---
Nah.  Good on them for taking someone who was still a noob despite playing since launch under their wings... lol
---
Not really.  I think that the outcome is entirely random, but no one ever said that some prefixes weren't rarer than others.  But I've generally found little correlation between the server's normal drops and the crafted results.
---
The thing about batch crafting, though, is that you can end up incapacitating that character for the next several days due to the ludicrously low daily Scrip limit.
---
I’m actually not in love with my B FFR Fixer. It’s too fast lol if that’s possible. I’m a big vats user and I find the first few shots, especially heady shots, rarely hit despite high percentages. Just feels like I’m burning through ammo too fast with it.
---
Now I LOVE my B 25 25 handmade. That gun is beautiful and feels perfect in your hands. 
---
I just bought a B 50 Crits fixer out of a vendor for almost 25k. So I’m going to try that one next and see if I like it better without the faster fire rate.
---
Ummm..
---
Im glad you're outta appalachia
---
Yeah, that's kinda true.   Occasionally, tho, you get a team that has players that will show up at one event after another together.   That's a good day.  :)   But it happens.   When it does and I like how the player plays, I send them a friend request.   Most say yes.   Then when I see their name on social, I can try to join their world and hook up again.
---
You can get disappointed either every day or just once a week. Pick one.
---
BFFR gat plasmas don't grow on trees unfortunately.
---
I've been by this event 3 times myself and have never seen anything in the boxes so far.
---
You don't know that. You're just being contrarian for no good reason. No one can really know what the effect would be until it is applied and tested. Now if we just had a Public Test Server set up...
---
Hell, we don't know what type of database they are using.  If they are using MongoDB the performance impact will be minimal.
---
Thanks!  And since you use power armor, your not using any armor rolls, so its just this
---
Doesn't make difference it's just rng. I like doing in batches though it's just more convenient. Don't forget to swap in armorer it increases the durability, super duper does not work though. 
---
Also if you use a train station with a armor bench it makes it easy to craft a bunch, and then use the scrip machine interface to see what you got and scrip, I find this easier than scrolling through 600 lines of equipment to find what I made. I use sunnytop station.
---
He moves once a day. He’s not on what level you should be. He’s how many days are left in season away from end.
---
Maybe buy up CAMP or weapon plans from the Whitesprings vendors? That’ll burn through caps.
---
You're fine.  👍  I do tend to be aware of being treated differently because I'm a girl.  It doesn't help that my hobbies and job are overwhelmingly male dominated.   I am very happy to report that in FO76 you are much more likely to be looked at as a lvl number first.  😁
---
Congrats!
---
I have the exact same Bloodied gauss mini, love it. The only other gauss mini I've kept is a Two-Shot, which I put a penta barrel on for maximum bullet hose lulz. Not quite as fun as other TSE heavies(or legacy gatling plasma), but with it I get to tell people just how 'hardcore' of an oldies fan I am when I see a red door and paint it blue.
---
Total random rng. Just crafted 30+ and got trash rolls. Two weeks ago crafted one last arm, after scripping the 4 previous... got Unyielding WWR. Craft in smaller batches, to keep disappointment in check haha
---
It shows 0, but even Caps and Scrips shows 0 (?)
---
Yuuuuup.  Just make sure if you're bloody you use emergency protocols.  It's pretty badass.
---
Started my first encriptyd event the other night after grinding for the fixer plan, got smoked by all those robots instead smdh
---
If you hop right back in it will try to connect you to the same server. The workaround is to back out and connect to the Atom store, and when you go back in it will find a fresh server.
---
Load up  Old World Radio 2 on youtube in the background. They do vintage fallout/bioshock music. It is a 24/7 live channel.   
---
Great stuff like the Billie Holiday Blue Moon cover I never heard before.
---
No that's not entirely true. Modders fixed the strangler heart lag months before Bethesda patched it.
---
Well dang, that feature isn't much help then lol
---
I can understand why people complain about it. It is not logical how it's made right now.
---
I think this system need to be reworked... Get rid of chanсes. If 3 star legendary items suppose to be rare then make 3-star enemies rare but with a guarantee 3-star drop.
---
P.S. and make fucking Queen drop 3-star items also. I'm so tired of those 1-star legendary baseball bats from her.
---
The main issue with Shielded Casual is the difficulty getting the plan, yes the is just enough players out there that sell Shielded Casual Under armours in the Vendor, but ~~you~~ that specific character knows the plan, you can't shield the atom store items.
---
Other than using Marine under armour, they could not of pick a "worse" under armour effect in that regards.
---
Cheers I’ll drink to that bro
---
I started playing when Wastelanders dropped, &amp; so have only heard of this survival mode, but sounds like it could've been a lot of fun. My hope is that they would re-implement it with some of the PvP lessons learned in NW. PvP sucks in adventure mode because we're too OP when it comes to dmg, &amp; too weak in terms of DR. The time to kill is a femtosecond, &amp; I hope that they would address that.
---
I use a low level gun, BUT I get BLAMED for one shotting because I'm 400+ I've had to explain to this 100+ guy that tried to blame me for one shotting a legendary, I explained that my lever action doesn't do 100 dmg and he just was like "oh that's still powerful", like guy if you really wanna blame me for it fine but don't be a dick about it. I told the guy like I watched a lvl 93 kill it but ofc I won't name drop. Not everyone is a dick in this game, not everyone wants to ruin the game experience but there are people who do so I get it.
---
I was continuing on my complaint about the state of things with this game and others. Reading comprehension bro.
---
Problem with favs is it goes to your wheel, if you do like me that have several chems favorited, you can't do it with your armor, clothes and weapons.
---
I would like them as a 1st perk.
---
That was the biggest issue during fashnat
---
I think I have all of the camp plans. Once in a while I come across one that’s new to me. I bought all of the bow components from Sunny recently. I’m hesitant to buy a lot of gun and PA plans since I don’t use them, but I guess I could make and sell some or make more upgraded versions to give out to low level players. I’ve been making level 20 fixers and giving them out to people I encounter. The other day I went around to a few low level vendors and bought them all out and then gave the items I bought back so they could put them back in their vendors.
---
You do have to deal about 5% of the creature's health as damage or it won't drop.  I've shot the ground near legendaries and registered damage of 8 - 25 many times and seen no drop.
---
Okay good i will be on in few hours and id like to buy the ones i need. I will msg you when am on
---
Thank you I’ll test this asap
---
O yes me and the wife both negative all good here
---
I've never used Speed Demon, so I can't really talk, but I never felt like the simple, but tedious need to eat more was worth it.
---
Something to chase at least
---
Nothing’s gonna change about soon(tm) 
---
Only thing, and I don’t even mean it in a bad way even if it leaves a bad taste, which is getting fixed without hesitation is if there’s a problem with atomic shop like being able to build something for free etc.
---
Ah yes, that’s the other difference that’s noticeable. You have to eat and drink quite a bit less which is nice.
---
Lol I was lucky enough to get ridiculously good u yielding. Trying to roll one last god roll 😃
---
Faster Fire rate weapons that causes the weapon to have a fire rate over 200 do the trick. You also need to wear a piece of armor with "Reflect 15% of damage while blocking" for some weird reason.
---
Ty
---
Look up TYR on YouTube. He has a build video. He has hit her for 60k before.
---
Liek the op, i have never entered NW and have never faced the autocomplete bug.
---
2v1 bruh
---
Ha truth
---
I would say it's intentional. It's a trick to get people invested in checking regularly, if not daily. Same theory behind the 'buy special currency for store items, but how much currency you can buy never equals what you can spend.' It's psychological manipulation that games do all the time.
---
I don't have any alcohol if you need it but many places have that
---
Best off sending a message on here and on xbox. GT: rammadeus
---
Bloodied means you die to one shot from pretty much anything.  Yeah, you kill everything with one shot, but you have to stay on your toes.
---
Wtf? Ive been desperate to build in Charleston! Must watch!
---
It was one of the first ones they ever sold, the Artificial Wood Panels Wallpaper, which came in a bundle with the Blue Flowers and Joy of the Hunt Wallpapers.  It's currently Vaulted, but it's been back at least once or twice.
---
One of the more versatile and homely ones, for sure, although the horizontal style they added at the same time as the Big Game Hunter Bundle ends up looking a bit nicer, in my opinion.
---
I've been using the bloodied one, but I realized I don't really use a bloody build, so I decided to get something else.
---
Get rekt.
---
And where the FUCK is my Captain Cosmos bubble helmet??
---
oh yeah if you have high agility and can use vats alot, you should be able to solo the scorchbeast queen with plenty of time left with that one
---
Less than halfway through in regards to total points required.
---
IIRC L67 is the halfway point.
---
nukashine?  How do you do that without being transported out of the fight zone?
---
There should always be a survival tent or five nearby. go dump your fluxes asap after event. After that you can loot safely without fear if death.
---
I don't have it from the bethesda launcher because I downloaded it from the xbox app, due to me having the game pass
---
The collections tab display is bugged. It won't read correctly until you go to a trade menu that deals in that currency or the game feels like it. Same for caps, scrip, badges, and everything else in the list. Sometimes it'll randomly display correctly, but either way accessing a trade screen involving the currency updates it.
---
This game needs constant new content as an online game but they only add mobile phone updates.  They only care to add cosmetic additions to spend the points on doing the same rotation of 10 activities.
---
Same with the Vault Boy skin on the T65 head.
---
Speaking of the Announcer - how does someone launch A FRIGGIN NUKE and she doesn't react. She should interrupt whatever is playing to announce it, even if it's with a resigned, "Someone's nuking Fissure Site Prime... Again."
---
The most underrated mutation is likely Empath, with Egg Head being next-in-line and Adrenal Reaction for "non-bloodied" builds. As for overrated, hard to answer that but can spin the question to lack-luster mutations, which would include Electrically Charged, Plague Walker, and Unstoppable Isotope.
---
u a medic? yes learn
---
u no medic? no learn
---
Me and my friend we’re doing scorchbeast queen when he went and insulted my friend. The next day we were doing the BOS fort event and he came back to my friend again
---
and then leave you with a core thats like 5% or less charge, every time you stow it as well
---
Almost, yeah. 
---
Release date was November 14, 2018.
---
Ditto.
---
I found her at least a half dozen times in the mire. Specifically by the Crevasse Dam.
---
I wait until she’s mutated before I drink that. So far, I’ve always had time to finish her off and drop my loot off before the blackout thing. If it’s taking longer, drink another and it resets.
---
Don't argue with trolls or fanboys. The result is always the same ;)
---
Yeah np i can find alcohol myself
---
the funny thing is it's not even because of the female character, for some reason everyone wants to give away their stuff, I do too.
---
Aah! It was a bug. Did a restart, and now it shows 100 Bullions.
---
Yeah,but I'm doing a junkies build so it kinda sucks for the character.
---
Did you add the future-tec camp module skin to your camp module?
---
I feel like they could earn some money by adding new songs. They could make a "MP3" or "Local songs" part in your pipboy. Where you would collect songs around the world, and also buy some from the Atom store from previous games. Which you then could play.
---
Is there a guide on how to manipulate the spawns in Line in the Sand? I've noticed that standing at one end of the fence makes all the enemies spawn at the other end, but that's about as far as I've gone with it
---
Oh good! 😄
---
did you apply the future tech skin from the legendary run to your camp module thing? it's glitched and makes your camp not show on map.
---
It is actually Whopper Wednesday.
---
Check out Angry Turtle's YouTube channel. He goes through many types of builds in detail.
---
SE corner of the map is probably the overall flattest and most open land in the game.  Unfortunately, its CB and ominously close to the most nuked region in the game.
---
Definitely. He should choose *much* nicer restaurants for his wife's infidelities.
---
i believe those plans should be available from the responder bot at watoga shopping plaza
---
All the new content could be added by fans I’m sure they could hold contests and ppl would compete to add content for free just to be apart of it.
---
It would perhaps be a bit too "meta," but I wouldn't mind if they added the ambient music from the other Fallouts as a radio station.  They surely own that outright.
---
To be honest, I had a similar experience.
---
Sometimes I get bored and decide to help out a random low level. So I remember looking at the public group that I was in and saw that there was a lvl 26. So, I went ahead and took one of each plan in my vendor (which were just sitting there and collecting dust) and went over to their camp. I went up to where she was standing, dropped all the plans along with some supplies and did the gift emote. She took the stuff and said 'thank you' on the mic. I prefer not to use mics so I just did the thumbs up and fast traveled away. 
---
But then I got to thinking, is she going to feel that I only gave her stuff because she is female? I mean, she did have one of the vault-girl icons. I also started thinking, what if she thinks that I am one of those creepy guys that follow these girls around and such...
---
So, basically, I just avoided contact with her for the rest of the game since I did not want to make her think that I was stalking her or something (which was not really difficult since everyone was basically doing their own thing anyways).
---
Maybe I just overthink things.
---
They are good to make and sell. You need to be able to craft for some of the tadpole/possum badges
---
Given the fact that they were all high levels then is probably the case too or a combination of both scenarios.
---
Stable Flux by its very name is no longer junk, it should always have moved to miscellaneous. It can only be a bloody minded decision by the devs to stimulate further grinding and player engagement.
---
do that 🤣✌️
---
If you move directly south to the terrain perimeter fence then stick to that fence as you move east, you will be fine. But your base may occasionally attract mobs.
---
Yes, we understand the mechanics of how it works. That's not the point. The point is that **it's a stupid mechanic.**
---
Make 3* legendary creatures rarer, and ensure they drop a 3* item. That way you still retain the rarity while decreasing player abrasion.
---
Tru i dont really use the wheel so Its kinda outta sight outta mind....
---
Overrated is healing factor imo. Empath for undervalued.
---
Angry turtle did a video on Empath and it applies to yourself, so if you run class freak and strange in number you gain like 20% damage resistance as long as your grouped, even if you're only one mutated with it.
---
I took a picture of it a while back good fine :)
---
Your gun naming is superb!
---
NO idea.. I've always wondered that.. I have a bunch that I bought but it just sits in my stash.  Never seen anything ask for it.
---
No one took your flux.  Since launch the loot you get for completing that event just *poofs* into the void if you die before you get it into your stash.  It's a known bug and happens literally every time if you die.
---
I've lost soooooo much flux to mirelurk kings and queens redonkulous poison attacks it's not even funny.
---
Really what they are giving you is: Inventory management work.
---
They are transferring their work to you!
---
I like to think I know what I’m talking about based on my experiences managing large databases in the past for a fortune 100 company. I don’t see how adding complexity (which I feel your solution does) will increase performance.
---
Honestly, it's easier to just find a stream that plays old music.
---
I have Amazon Prime and while they have an All 50s station (which gets about as tiresome as the actual Fallout radio), 60s Rock or Classic Rock works fine too.
---
Thanks for that tip on fireworks and reload, wasnt' aware.   Since I never use grenades I'll just keep one of those equiped.
---
Oh there are many other things that make humanity 'doomed' that goes far beyond sexism.
---
For crafting these: (once you buy the plans for them with gold bullion)

I wonder now how many people assume I'm a guy with a female toon, until I get in the Mic.  Then I wonder how many think I'm an 8 year old girl!  Gosh but I sound so high pitched over coms.
---
Even during Fasnacht the problem was it a was only a sloth and 2-3 people would just unload on it immediately where it spawned. I still think i'd be impressed to see someone legitimately take out the SBQ in one or two hits.
---
as negative and poopy as the actual game is, the player base has been almost exclusively kind to me (and I've been playing for a few hundred hours now)
---
If you visit the nexusmod website, and go to their fo76 mod page, there are high def map replacements that have every little tiny body of water on them. You dont need to install it if you dont want, just the screen caps should let you find it.
---
If I recall it's for the strangler power armour from the Vault (94) raids that have been removed, The armour can be bought from Regs for gold buillion
---
It blew my mind lol
---
The HM is only lvl 45, and even w/o knowing the plan it is in the loot table.
---
Cheswick II. Sometimes he’s dead.
---
Just do what I do, kill all music in game and play your own themed music!
---
Farm water.
---
yes batteries included is a must have, you will need almost 1,000  2mm ec rounds to fight scorchbeast queen but its a great weapon
---
this is exactly how i feel, i loved this franchise but sadly i feel like this is probably gunna be the last fallout game were gonna get
---
Just put all that stuff in a vendor machine and label is 'Free stuff for Newbees'
---
All of a sudden, you will see a level 300+ come in and clear everything!
---
Ohhhh okay do I still need it ? Cause I can buy those for gold bullion or do I need that steel to craft them ?
---
That's awesome to know! I'm on PS4 so no mods for me, but it sounds super useful to have the screenshots of it!
---
I watch my roommate play, and the look of horror he gives when he's got the wrong gun equipped and gun fu's everything in sight on accident is priceless.
---
"I thought it would just tag them."
---
And then the swearing on voice chat starts.
---
AngeredCarrot and outlawvaultboy on PS4
---
You can buy the plans to craft these with bullion, and you need the steel to actually craft them. Like shown on wiki pages :) (it used to be called Vault 94 Steel, nobody just have not bothered to update wiki)
---
You sound like you are over thinking.  Now dropping that red sequin dress, that might be creepy, unless it was mixed in with a bunch of other outfits.
---
There are different stages in the game that really played all COMPLETELY different.  I thought I understood the game, going through and completing all the missions &amp; storyline... Then I was all about selling stuff, then it was all about Bullion and grind.  It all depends on what phase you are in.   For instance.  I dont' care about money or scrip because I'm always maxed out. So I dont' keep up on my vending as much and i'm more selective in what I put in, ony a few higher demand items.   
---
Different phases of the game will cause you to build and play differently.... so feeling like a "noob", really doesn't go away because there is always something/someway else to play things... that being said, it's up to you to decide on how you do things.
---
Plans for the armors can be bought from Regs, you still need the steel to craft them. Which you buy from purveyor.
---
You can *call* it a cheat if you want.  That doesn't make it one though.
---
So does that thing fire on its own? I’ve had one in my camps before but I’ve never seen it do anything. I’m assuming it would be for scorchbeasts or rouge vertibots
---
I there a similar wall for the shrouded effects, or does the Fixer's effects still contribute towards overall stealth?
---
just last week I got into 3 different arguments, with different people, about whether HTD (harder to detect while sneaking) stacks. one of them swore it did, because he'd been playing without the sneak perk and a full HTD set instead, for over 50 levels. and thus it was impossible that it did not stack.
---
he ended up blocking me because I posted video evidence that no, it in fact does not stack.
---
the damage calculation formula is listed in the wiki. but if you want to be absolutely sure, you can use the several tools available for Fo4 to dig into the Fo76 files. the creation kit works, too. a more practical way of going about it would be to let enemies hit you and take note of the damage. but keep in mind this method can be highly ineffective due to armor penetration and how strong their attack is. high-powered attacks (like the SBQ sweep) more or less ignore armor whereas a level 5 scorched with a pipe gun is gonna have trouble bypassing your 500 dr.
---
but to answer your question specifically, dr works linearly. meaning that there is no threshold where the diminishing returns begin. sure, the difference between 0~100 dr and 100~700 dr might be the same, but the difference between 300 and 500 is **much** more noticeable than 500 and 700.
---
assuming my previous example: 100 dr negates 35 damage from a 100 damage attack. 300 more dr would negate something like 22.5 damage, and another 300, only 12.5 damage.
---
this is just a gross oversimplification of course. so you can get an idea of what I mean. but as you can tell, despite the diminishing returns, having 400 dr is still not too shabby. it's something you'd definitely notice. I mean, even 700 dr, despite the difference between 35 and 12.5, is still considerable.
---
but that's just in theory. in practice, flat damage reduction is infinitely better. like I mentioned before, use a lone sentry bot to compare a set of vanguard/bolstering or just abnormally high dr, with a mixed set of solar armor. the healing plus the flat 15% damage reduction from troubleshooter's means you'll be taking far less damage than the 12.5, or even 22.5 reduction as if you were stacking dr.
---
Played since BETA, lvl 202, still feel like a noob and I love it.
---
I keep learning new things about the game, and I love learning new things.
---
Yes, there's two things you're meant to do with it.  So doing one of those things is of course undeniably fine.
---
The fact NW was thrown in as a daily is baffling.  It’s not even good if you like NW because they took the free perk cards out of the challenge, so you get a pittance of SCORE.  It’s a huge everyone loses scenario.
---
D:
---
I hear you 100%.
---
If you really want that SCORE though, make a secondary character, use them for NW cuz they'll start at level 0 and level up much easier.
---
That would make sense, I never bothered with those.. jumped right to T-65.
---
Lead and steel for regular 2 mm EC? Two of the easiest crafting materials to get.
---
Ammosmith, Super Duper and Batteries Included. Increases the amount of ammo produced and the reduces weight of energy ammo.
---
I carry hundreds of rounds of fusion cells, plasma cartridges and EC ammo and about 50 fusion cores. BI is a great perk
---
You on Xbox?
---
What blows my mind is I never use grenades so I dropped/destroyed them 😕
---
Same as me. Strangler Heart got over nerfed to be useful, so i prefer more defence from T-65. Also, i prefer SS armors over solar/thorn because of the defence values. And effects on those just don't impress me enough.
---
Bottom line is, it isn't live.  It isn't fixed.  If you can't cope with that, that's on you.
---
Yes, but still more AP to with.
---
ohhhh never thought of that...
---
I think we’ll get more fallout games, it’s too big of an IP for them (I mean we’re getting a TV show). That said, I don’t expect FO76 to have too much longer of a lifespan.
---
Pretty much every second player vendor sells it. Look for the dudes with many plans.
---
I started Free Range the other day without anyone starting it with me. Halfway through one other person ended up joining in with me around the bloodbug part. I thought, oh wow cool. I cant exactly 1, 2, or 3 shot the Sheepsquatch, but having an extra gun in there will guarantee all 3 of the Brahmin will survive. The various weapon and mod plans are what im going for in that event, could care less about more legendary garbage the sheepsquatch will drop. I'm a pretty big team player so I wait to see the sheepsquatch's health drop a little bit from my event mate's attacks before I unload my bloodied fixer in a psychotat induced frenzy. Sure enough the Sheepsquatch goes down before he could get too far. Then out of nowhere. A 3rd person comes running up and thumbs downing me. This person wasnt around for the Yaugoi*/bear or even during the peacefule moment before the sasquatch pops up. No warning no nothing. Ended up spending the next 30 mins argue messaging him back and forth with him accusing me of being a terrible player and selfish. I'm not a judgemental person if you come at the tail end of an event to collect the rewards, it's no biggie,....but when someone tries to turn around and trues to start accusations like that...maaaaaaaaaan glad he didnt get a hit then.
---
Its quite fun when you play With a team and everyone have a mic.
---
wow a tv show?!?! that i didnt know,  ive been a fan since the original old Fallout so this is great news
---
I like how he keeps on coming until  he offloads his insult, tried running away with crippled limbs and he was like a real slow terminator, hahaha
---
Try for the Red Asylum Uniform.
---
They're coming to take me away ha ha. They're coming to take me away hoo hòo hee hee haa haa!
---
To the funny farm where dresses are beautiful all of the time..........
---
I've decided to roll back to a shotgun build for the time being; I prefer using them over heavy weapons, and I've already got a mixed set of Unyielding/Bolstered to roll with while I grind for more Bullion. I guess I'll be back on the grind (outside of SCORE); I've been really laid back in terms of getting my daily gold, so maybe this will give me a reason to keep up the effort. Gotta get that Secret Service set, too!
---
Well mine is to sit and brood on a pile of sick endgame guns, armor and materials like some kind of militaristic doomsday dragon.
---
Oh. It sucks I’m so low on flux and I lost all 12 each
---
I have 850 hours and I just learned something new today I’m going to try out.
---
😂 i usually do but most times my stash is full even with fo1st.
---
Permanent
---
🤦‍♂️
---
The time of the tinfoil hat is nigh.
---
permanent now
---
until you take them off
---
They stick until you use addictol
---
You know how in Minecraft, technically the endgame is the Ender Dragon, but people go far beyond that? Think of it like *technically* the scorchbeast queen is supposed to be the endgame, but then you do vault 79 then you just grind infinitely. 
---
Camp building is severely limited and Bethesda has no means to really tell a compelling story with an online game so we just wait for the next event
---
I pretty much hate out of the NW challenges, for pretty much the same reasons. Takes way too much time if its a challenge that may take a few matches. I could earn the 250 score in adventure in the time it takes in NW.
---
I only do them if its something really simple.namely place a camp. If i have time to kill it do the survive a certain time. Ill do the rank up one if I know I'm close but otherwise no.
---
Luckily I dont need t bother with the NW challenges if I have done my maths correctly, pretty sure I've got to the point I will finish the run in good tie just ding the rest of the daily/weekly challenges, and without fretting about the repeatable too much.
---
As ZAX would say, the candidate was simply... not qualified.
---
or radscorpion omelets
---
What makes it worse is that with Wastelanders they've reduced the length of nighttime in the game.
---
you get grenades out of the box. 
---
range isn't that great though
---
Happened to me to days ago then a few hours later the game bugged and wiped my strangler heart. That was a painful one
---
Cool, I will add you when I get on tonight, I do have a instigating explosive smh as well, you welcome to either.
---
Stuffy sheepsquatch counts as two things, so you can skip one.
---
yeah. this was a while ago. before I caved in and bought Fo1st.
---
Nice, thank you
---
Yeah I've been pleasantly surprised. The few player interactions I've had have been pretty cool. One guy dropped a bag full of plans for me when I was really, really new, back at the Wayward. They were basic things to get me started, nothing super OP but very helpful and useful. 
---
Other interactions have just been some hi's and bye's and silly waves doing events together. I was expecting a salty player base since the game was so poorly received. Honestly I've very surprised with how much I'm enjoying it so far. 
---
Only had one guy I didn't care for. I accidentally got a bounty for 10 caps on me somehow. I picked a safe that was apparently too close to a workshop. He watched me clear out a bunch of baddies and loot them then wiped me out and took my stuff.
---
OK so once you get the grenades out of the box, does an option come up on the piece of artillery to fire or something? Im over 1500 hours in and don’t know how the damn artillery works
---
Ahh thanks man I was always wondering where I can craft fuel with it and why the heck 10mm ammo is under energy ammo lol
---
Level 240, 1000+ hours, and I am still a noob.
---
yeah,  I'm level 68 (earned) on the board.. .I think I am just going to buy 3 levels just to compensate for all the NW points I wont' be doing.
---
Does the ammo converter give xp?  That would be nice considering how long we stand there smashing buttons to convert...
---
And / or hired more competent designers / developers and used them instead of interns and office temps. But yea.. They are clearly taking the budget server package from AWS.
---
I liked it when it was the Christmas Scorched. The sound was awesome, and the outfits were amazing.
---
Personally as a woman I've never felt that way about players giving me gifts and neither has my 16yo daughter. She still goes on about how thrilled she was like a year ago when one of my regular teammates (a dude) gave her a bunch of armor, a legendary handmade, and a lot of other stuff. It's just nice. These days I'm the one running around dropping presents for the lowbies and helping them out with events, and it's always good wholesome fun. I mean, I'm a radical feminist and all, but I tend to assume the best about people unless proven wrong. Almost 2 years later, I still haven't met any creeps in this game.
---
I had been playing the game for a year when FO1st was offered. Did the calculation to see that yearly subscription was equivalent to 7 monthly payments. Thought it was highly likely that I would be playing for at least 7 months and got the yearly. Now seven months in still having fun with the Legendary Run and looking forward to the return of the BOS.
---
Yw
---
Counterpoint: I am actually playing NW now, when before, I wasn't.
---
&gt; Secret service skin for the underarmor doesn't support modding
---
You mean the new camo one? I was on the fence with that one, glad i decided not to
---
You just lob a grenade at where you want to bomb and if you're in range... INCOMING!!!!!!!!!!
---
Good luck with the grind, my the RNG be in your favour.
---
Ohhh I gotcha so it’s a real big issue when people spend their scrip and then can’t offload the junk legendaries they got into more scrip bc of the limit?
---
Tip: if you join scorched earth often, you will receive improved repair kits.
---
I only repair armor using materials when my stash is over 750.
---
Blew. My. Mind. I understand completely now, and I can’t thank you enough for taking the time to explain this to me without being hostile, condescending, or close-minded, *ahem* like some people on here, especially when I should have done the research on my own. Definitely makes me want to rethink some of the strategies I have. And yeah now that I think about it bolstering does seem pretty useless, at least if you’re wearing full SS it is.
---
What platform are you on? I'm on PS4 and my matches begin in less than 5 minutes 100% of the time.
---
No shit. So it fires because of the smoke signal from the grenades
---
Hi does some have a healing factor serum u can sell me? Btw i play on xbox
---
Permanent until you do something to remove them.
---
This threw me as well.  I had always assumed addictions were more debilitating than that, and that it must be a minor pain as a Junkie to keep those chems stocked, but you don't have to.  At all.
---
Maybe it will catch up? Check if you really lost the treasury notes and in the worst case, contact Beth support
---
Not a chance.. you have 4 load screens you have to go through and you wait in the lobby.... I play on PC and xbox... both are same..
---
the flares are bue (I guess so as not to confuse the vertibot, which use red smoke)
---
Equip the flare like you would a grenade - when you want an artillery strike, toss the flare.
---
If you are within range, the barrage will come.  If you are out of range, there will be some sort of message on the screen telling you so
---
Honestly though, I don't care about tse when my guns are already explosive and magic.
---
I’m right there with you in my strong dislike for grindy NW challenges mate, but maybe hold off on buying those levels until the season has almost run its course. No sense in throwing hard to come by atoms down the sh!tter!
---
You don't need to nerf your build for simply carrying a tag weapon on you. Not carrying one is a poor excuse if it can't be helped that someone's build is too strong.
---
If you're on PS4 and ever need a hand with a quest or gear, feel free to hit me up 🙂
---
Awesome, thanks dude!
---
I’ve done Encryptid quite a few times and no fixer drops.  Mostly white wolf fedoras lol
---
That would be so cool
---
Thank you.  If you couldn't tell, I quite fancy old British men.  For their amazing music, that is.
---
Your world is more a private instance, if noone is in the server for five minutes it will reset itself, including workshops as well. You can trade things to your alts through this by storing items in suitcases or cigarette machines and then log out and log in quickly onto your other character and pick up the items you out in the containers.
---
They may be adding persisting workshops at some point however they have mentioned this along time ago and never done it.
---
Really? Ugh, that’s why it feels like I only get 5 minutes of mister sandman.
---
.50 cal is much, much more powerful...
---
I wanted to thank everyone for the friendly advice and tips, it’s nice to see it’s not just me who has hit this, and that assultrons are mf’ers no matter your level.
---
They really should just make a clear difference between the starred legendaries. Maybe a 3 star legendary will mutate twice and will always drop a 3 star weapon. 
---
The whole “you have a chance to get a 3 star from a 3 star legendary” is such a terrible system. It really downplays legendaries and makes the system feel like a giant lootbox
---
No. Thank god.
---
I enjoyed it, except the low max levels meant the legendary drops were auto-scrip. I used my Chinese Stealth 1H melee who ran and bounced around the Ash Heap like it was a training assault course - always in motion, always listening for the tell tale gurgle of a special MM.
---
And then it was directly followed by Fasnacht. Slow, boring walk around the same small village...yawn.
---
I mean, if they just allowed people in the PTS to have access to all the atomic items and the ability to scale their level, weapon's and gear. people would be able to test out all the items with having to do another grind in the PTS to match their current live character.
---
In the past they use to be really annoying cause when you died you lost your addictions.
---
I’m not sure about resetting completely. Workshops yes if you leave the server for long enough.
---
Speaking of that. You can trade between characters if you use a case in game. As an example I use Charleston train station, one of the suitcases out front to drop stuff in. As long as I am quick and switch characters, log back in everything is there for the new character. I’ve heard 5 minutes max so I just go as quickly as I can.
---
Hmm, so if I never close the game this instance could at least survive until the next maintenance period? Don't know if I could pull that through, but thank you for your detailed reply!
---
PC, but appreciate the offer
---
It still contributes to stealth still yes.
---
What on earth makes you think everyone would like this?
---
It’s been working fine for me as far as I can tell, but I also rarely shoot explosive rounds close to myself
---
Nope no xp
---
Big Bad John is such a badass song, I used to listen to Jimmy Dean's version at work
---
Yeah, im lvl 476. I know about the perks and crafting. However, 2mm EC is still by far the most difficult and annoying heavy ammo to craft compared to other heavy ammo. You can only craft x28 at a time if i'm not mistaken. With 5mm for example you get 180 5mm ammo each time. It's a great weapon but if you play for 4 hours a day and you're a heavy gunner you will spend half of your play time farming for resources to use your gun.
---
 I would totally use it, it is the best heavy gun in the game right now. However, the state of 2mm ec at this moment doesn't really welcome extended use of the gauss minigun. That's why you rarely see people use it.
---
twice out of maybe a hundred times the game has crashed and i lost stuff mid transfer. Nothing of great value was lost. Mostly scrap legendary weapons and a few worth around 10k. And a load of ammo including 20k 5.56. 
---
So i'd definitely be wary of transferring anything you really wouldn't want to lose.
---
Some guy dropped the fixer and bear arm plans for me out of nowhere last week. I've spent the past couple of hours crafting the weapons and dropping them to random people.
---
5 minutes is more than enough time to log back on. Wasn't quite sure if it recycles as soon as you leave, but this sounds promising, thank you!
---
I don't even know why armor gives less, it's not like our scrip is uncapped or our inventory isn't in a constant state of being too full.
---
This! I purposely use my lower power weapons in events and wave people over when I come across a legendary. Lately ive seen people one shoting legendaries in events. We’re all playing the same grind, be kind to others.
---
Yep. Loads me into the lobby (which is full within a matter of seconds). Wait for people to pick the map. Pick my landing spot. Deploy the players. Start match.
---
Never seen that entire process take more than 5 minutes total. Have played NW daily for the Legendary Run.
---
You will be auto logged out if you don't move for 20 mins I believe and servers often go down for maintenance if a instance has been working for awhile. When this happens you will also be logged out but new instances will be generated with the idea of creating less laggy and more up to date worlds.
---
Yes, I have done and friends have done hundreds of SBQ fights without people staggering - three to nine times a day, every day, for months. Do three SBQ, then Encryptid, then cycle to a different private server and repeat.
---
And she lands. For extended periods of time. With little fucking about.
---
Just because you don’t know, don’t make wild claims about what I do, and what I know. You’ll look like less of a pompous ass.
---
The thing about FO1st is it still applies the reset (to some degree).  Like, if you sell stuff to vendors as you did in a public server, sometimes it'll still retain the amount of caps remaining in the Vendor.  Same scrip remaining in the Purveyor.  Same Bullion.  And sometimes, when "Verdant Season" in certain regions occur, they won't give out the usual increase.
---
However, another issue with the Private World is, once you start a Private World, you cannot have the option to switch from All Friends to Team Only and/or vice-versa.
---
But overall, some things do revert as if it's brand new.
---
Underrated comment... appreciated the reference 😁
---
Aye. There is a delay though. So say you wanted to hit a big mob or something large like a sheepsquatch you'd wanna throw a grenade and then lure them into the blast zone.
---
I’ve had the auto complete thing happen to me. I haven’t played NW in 8 months
---
If you want to find the spot I’m talking about, it’s north of Hemlock Holes, and east of The Crosshairs.
---
Same. NPCs brought back many returning players
---
Very true, always be cautious with what your sending. Always get a friend if you can or send a few items at a time.
---
it's a prefab. And it'll be back. maybe a month. Maybe a little bit longer.
---
Unyielding (armor) plus Nerd Rage (perk) plus Herd Mentallity (mutation)
---
Similar, my dense chest mod wasn't working worth a damn last night. It's marine, not SS.
---
I would say we will be lucky to get any new songs as the Licensing costs are kind fo crazy and can be next to nothing to like 100k+
---
There not going to want to spend that money on Music over most other ingame content that will likely make the players happy and bring in more money.
---
I would like more music but i do not think we will see any unless there making a lot of money to fund a fair side add on later.
---
I can't wait for that to occur this year.  It's a really good event, especially when part of a Team.  Glassed Cavern is a perfect example for grinding.
---
I asked the same 2nd half of question a few weeks ago.  Response was you get the gold, but cant use it until you complete the vault raid.
---
If you want to be overly cautious, you can also chose not to claim it quite yet.
---
(I've had many score rewards I didn't claim several days - no harm came to them, even claiming out of sequence)
---
Thank you for your answer. I have a character from the beginning I'm about to delete, but I would at least like to transfer some useful stuff to my main. I don't want anyone to burden himself with such a task, so I would rather do it by myself.
---
I am a cute female with pink hair who plays a cute female with pink hair. I made a big burly dude as an alt.
---
Fully agree
---
If I’m feeling generous I’ll usually check their profile real quick to see if they’re actually a new player or not before I drop them anything. But let’s be honest I do it most of the time to free up space haha
---
that would be awesome, they could probably added through the atomic shop as a free item. They should also add the ability to see what people have bought from your vending machines. Man, I wish we had a personal terminal or something to keep track of our personal stuff.
---
No worries! Yeah and I’ve even gone through my list, 4 characters, to trade amongst all of them. So tons of time, just make sure you log back into private lol
---
I always collect ammo with my main to distribute.
---
Wow, learned something new. Tyvm
---
I’ll be damned, learned something new. Tyvm
---
I wish the seedy shed would come back.  Missed my chance on that one.  I’ve been hoarding my atoms since starting FO76 and haven’t spent anything yet.  Haven’t been playing too long though....
---
Agreed. 99% i'm in my SS, only on occasion do I jump into the PA.  SS+Jetpack+Mutations+Strange in Numbers = My Jam
---
Okay so, you've already ruled out higher level enemies giving more Durability, as you were noting they were the same level, but you were leveling up, until level 10, then same results again. Thats handy to know! What about base stats vs buffs. Do buffs seem to help, or is it just your base SPECIAL that affects it? Thanks!
---
Similar thing happened to me few days ago. Three low levels helped. Thankfully I am stealth built so I was able to deal huge damage while remaining undetected. They distracted the wending os and kept them off me. Just took some time. Anyway, those low levels can surprise you. They wanna prove they can hang and contribute to a team and events.
---
That would be epic. I hope we'll get to meet Julie some day.
---
I know I fell for the same trick a few months ago, went to place it found I could not, messaged on Reddit with the same question and got told no you can't display it, bummer
---
that is also the startgame goal
---
My entire endgame is struggling through the obscene boredom of daily chores in the hopes of getting the cool items near the end of the SCORE track.
---
I'm likewise exhausted waiting for something genuinely cool and not just campy or Fortnite inspired on the atomic shop... or worse, just more recycled content and false advertising.
---
I love, love, LOVE building. It's the only part of this game that feels genuinely unique and rewarding. Yet it is a true love/hate relationship. I can't tell you how many camps I've had to demolish due to the support bug (items that have NOTHING attached being required to support something else).
---
I want to build stuff. I want to keep building. But the insanely restrictive budget, day 1 bugs and barrage of ugly pieces on the atomic shop are finally starting to wear me down. I bought several builders during the recent Steam sale, and am about to just jump ship entirely to play Space Engineers.
---
when you gain a weight from ammo that has a .0000 weight
---
Me and I won't
---
I thought so. It was more of a joke from my side, but it's seriously good to know more of the mechanics behind it.
---
You da real MVP
---
What cracks me up is when I enter an already-occupied bush and the other wookie has no idea I'm there.
---
Well in your original post you say your a guy. Hence you can see why maybe I dint believe you.
---
You’re a blessing, thank you so much!
---
Shhhhh
---
Pre-fab.
---
Also the other way applies. If I suddenly start risking my life running straight into a group of enemies to punch the legendary, please stop panicing and emptying every clip in your inventory in some misguided view that my punches are going to once shot the legendary.
---
After level 30 when I started investing in enforcers. Kneecapper in 4 was op and that is essentially what enforcer is. Well more crippling but just focus on the legs. 
---
Also get fireproof, even at level 2 scorchbeasts screech are a thing of the past. Still look out for the gas attack.
---
If you have a pal invite them in. extra protection.
---
I use the ice cooler outside the rusty pick. my 4 alts live there so they can sell legendaries and buy from mumbles.
---
Always has been ...
---
I saw another comment on this thread that said that the camper wasn't actually broken when it released, it just broke about two months ago and hasn't been fixed yet.
---
So... do with that information what you will.
---
And I am over here like what are you talking about? I had a triple spawn of it one time. Shit I traded a red for a yellow since I never see the yellow.
---
Yes please.
---
Played since beta, with several characters and some time off to play other games and reset the interest. I always feel like a noob. Don't understand specific builds and right now I'm really learning to switch between perks useful for different situations.
---
No, OP is a guy, I'm a woman commenting. What I'm saying is that people of all genders make characters of all genders (not necessarily their own), and not always for special treatment or to be creepy or whatever. Most of us just want to play a game and have fun.
---
Why didn't u just put it in ur stash or scrap box?
---
That is generally the sign of a newbie BushWookie; they are very timid and quick to frighten and will often show signs of extreme agitation and may even attack. With time they usually learn to calm down and start to trust their own kin.
---
If this game wasn't Bethesda's it could be magnificent and 75% of posts from this sub wouldn't be totally legit complaints
---
Edit: Word "sub" was missing
---
yes.
---
OOOOF!
---
what else? thanks
---
Thanks! One answer is enough
---
YES
---
I couldn’t interact with anything in the game. I could walk around, but I couldn’t enter doors, use workbenches, interact with NPCs, nothing. ):
---
That was probably me as I am level 735 and the fight in question was pretty quick even for me  the first queen went down so quick I hardly had time to unload on her so someone had a crazy ass weapon.
---
Most everything in the Atom site will rotate in and out. No worries there. You'll get your shot at it again for sure.
---
As for the log cabin itself, it's a prefab cabin. Not a building set, but just a building. It's pretty cool, though. Bethesda did an excellent job on most of the prefab buildings, IMHO.
---
I’m Big Sad now.
---
I want a quest for the young lady, she sends you out to find a holotape with some new music. Let you interact with her and let it play after you complete.
---
Don't have a pal, unfortunately. I have friends playing the game, but I'm the only one on PC. It's not that I don't trust strangers, as I said, I don't want to be a burden. That's why I still don't have the swimmer badge.
---
Yikes. Whenever I see a problem in the server I just close the game and start it back up
---
Are you on ps4?
---
100k for 3 croco backpack plans? Are you crazy? Ppl selling them for 6k lmao.
---
It's disappointing to even see one
---
It makes sense, doesn't it?
---
Yeah, I’ve learned my lesson for sure this time. I guess I’m back on the hunt for fertilizer and plastic once I get the motivation to log back in later.
---
The have a ton of atoms but not going to use them unless we’re nearing the end and I feel like I won’t make it.  Also if I feel like the end content is garbage I probably won’t spend them either lol
---
That... seems like such an obvious choice now that I read it.
---
That makes WAY more sense. Huh.
---
I would equate the Jetpack with the level of bonuses other Backpack mods offer.
---
Although I guess the Jetpack is essentially one of the main perks of SS Armor, and thus the Grind.
---
Wookie on wookie violence is never the answer. I actually had to attack 2 murderous vicious killers that gunned down my fellow bush wookie the other day. He accidentally joined my bush sat still looking at me for a bit and then apparently got jumpy and decided to look for an unoccupied one. He was tragically cut down in route so I had to avenge him. 
---
I'm now up to 8 player kills just over one year into this mode. Lol.
---
On ps4, croccos are pretty rare on ps4. Someone offered me 2 the other week for my plain leathercoat and someone traded one of my mod for an AAERW gat plas. So I guess it’s reasonable?
---
Ummm there isn't. SS is the best  :)  With a side of T-65 for the rare occasion.  But I do have the Jetpack with my SS Chest :)  and yes it's awesome. If you made it a backpack mod, you would lose your extra Large BP Storage.
---
A similar bug happens to me every time I log in, I have to switch weapons just to get the bullet count to show as it is always zero or even when I switch weapons it still shows zero until I fire one of them and then the bullet count pops up.
---
The pace of the new content is completely fine to me. Just test it more, damn.
---
Indeed. At least on PC I saw the plan for sale last night for 15k and still didn't get it. It's kinda rare but not rare enough for me to feel bad about passing it up. Dunno about other systems.
---
Depends on the buyer though. Caps are largely meaningless, and if you want something bad enough the price is the price... But I definitely wouldn't pay that :D
---
I am surprised you can build there, really cool.  DO you get constant super mutant attacks?
---
Guess you haven’t been playing fallout 4 for long?
---
I get stoned and fckn turn off the hud and just fckn walk around.
---
That's always fun. I laugh at all the people that walk right through me or don't notice me when I have a bad or even no hiding spot but in all honesty I'm sure I've done the same countless times.
---
What are the best things to get addicted to to minimize the penalties?
---
In... NW? hunter/hunted?
---
I have turned off my radio now.  Makes me excited when I find one in game.
---
&gt;it costs them money every time one of those songs plays
---
Not quite, they license it for use and are free to use it as much as they want within the terms of the license from there on. Can you imagine them trying to validly report on how many times each individual song was played across each server? What about private servers? What about idle server instances that need spinning up for more players? It doesn't make sense to charge per play.
---
Haven't turned the radio on since the first month. Got old like day 1 lol
---
Never touched it, if I wanted to PvP I'd go and play a game that's built for it. Thew few people I know that also play 76 either haven't touched or tried it, said 'it's ok' then never really touched it again.
---
I got it mixed up with the atom challenges my bad
---
I would expect that the Jetpack would take the place of the backpack, so no extra storage or other benefits.
---
(oops - I needed to read the last sentence)
---
I'm actually at 17 kills over 41 overseer's ranks. A stat which surprises the crap out of me considering how absolutely atrocious I am at pvp games.
---
And why do I sometimes hear two songs within the same like 15 minute timespan? It's like a broken shuffle, sometimes songs play multiple times an hour but I dont hear others for ages.
---
what console do you play on
---
well you can ask in this forum for someone to die in water for you. you'll get someone willing to help no bother. 
---
just like i said. be wary of transferring anything of value.
---
USSS. For the love of denouncing Nazis, can we please start calling it USSS.
---
On ps4 there easily worth a B2525 or legacy or rare outfits/multiple of them. I'm on the trade Reddit all the time and am on ps4. PC economy may be different but on PS4 it's 100% worth it.
---
NW. Do people actually volunteer for hunter/hunted then bush wookie??
---
Haha, yeah always funny seeing a level 9 farming for Scrip or Treasury Notes deep in the southeast part of the map.
---
Idk, I don't play it.
---
no problem, happy to help. it's important to test these things by yourself. despite being a mess, the mechanics in the game are surprisingly deep. even if only by accident.
---
bolstering specifically, I think the only armor type that would really benefit from it is wood. but like I mentioned before, at 19% health, any attack that bypasses armor is gonna kill you.
---
I use blocker just so I can get close to the queen.
---
I rather have chemist (or that food/water thing) on my backpack and jetpack on chest. I don't see any other chest mod being really beneficial. Deep Pockets? You get more carry weight from chemist mod on your backpack. Ultra-light? +5AP and lower weight (again chemist mod), very meh... Dense? Not really needed if you already are using *Fireproof* perk (like most of us are). Unless you have some legacy weapon you are using. And even then Dense will not save you if you are hit by your own weapon explosions.
---
no buffs I'm afraid. only my level/luck. until I hit level 10 and higher level scorched started spawning regularly, they'd only drop the same level 5(?) pipe revolver. so it's not the weapon level, either. and I'd never roll one with better durability until I leveled up/leveled my luck, then I'd get a handful of better ones right after.
---
same happened when the higher level ones started dropping level 10 revolvers. I mean, being higher level means the bar is naturally larger. but the same thing happened, a dozen runs and I couldn't find a better pipe than the best one in my inventory. level up and I'd instantly roll a better one.
---
same with shotguns.
---
That's why i don't bother trying the PTS. If you want me to TEST your stuff then provide every necessary tool for that. I don't have time to grind in both PTS and live service, my time is limited.
---
Murderer! I am rank 43 or 44, so your skill is at least double mine. Haha.
---
Literally me oh and I'm at max stash and equipload. Fun
---
Oh be quiet.  Everybody on here knows what SS is.
---
I've been eyeing Godot as an elderly CS student and someone who wants to tinker with game dev... thanks for this! :)
---
On the other hand, that 'magic' effect probably won't last forever...it's great for players so they're bound to fix it quickly (before any of the serious bugs).
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to say “fuck it, if someone else is gonna one shot it, I’m just gonna kill it before they can” - bloodied build that risked death to bash enemies until others killed in one hit. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I still try to be nice but if I get a feeling someone is gonna just one shot, I’ll beat them to it so at least my team can reap benefit
---
😂
---
Seems like the main perk of ss armor would be that it's the best armor in the game already, and that you can essentially roll for pieces until you get what you want (granted, this is limited by modules).
---
I love my ss armor, don't get me wrong. I just feel like there's never going to be a chest I'll ever use over it only because of the Jetpack.
---
I've seen several people ask if theres a nazi armor skin in the game.
---
its awesome imo
---
Thanks everyone I just got it given from a player at scorched earth 😊
---
My favorite NW moment happened a few days ago. I bush-wookied all the way to the final 5. The other 4 were a team. They couldn't find me and ended up doing confused emotes. Eventually, they located me when the map shrunk to the smallest size possible. After slaughtering me, they gave me a round of heart emojis, in appreciation of finding such a fantastic hiding spot.
---
Thankee for the info and clarification. Less duping on other platforms eh :D
---
I read that the SBQ requires a minimum amount of damage for an individual to be eligible for awards.  For all other Legendary Creatures, do you just need to “tag them” with a single shot, or is there a minimum damage required.  And of the legendary “mutates” and goes back to full health, do you need to tag them again or something as the pre-mutate attack do the job?  TIA!
---
That's awesome!
---
As is stands OP now that Shadowed mods are fix THE best Sneaking Armor set right now is a Shadowed Thorn Armor Set.
---
Am on rn i will msg you on xbox
---
I use Spotify on Xbox. It runs in the background and you can control the app from your phone. I have an FO76 playlist that I use with almost 200 songs.
---
Don't get me wrong, I know that from a min max perspective, I also love having Chemist on my backpack, freeing up a 3 point Traveling Pharmacy on my perks. It's definitely the best choice.
---
My issue comes down to feeling like there's no reason at all to use any other armor on your chest. It's already the best in slot for damage reduction. And you can craft them to try and find the best pieces eventually. With Legendary Perks coming that involve full sets, there'll never be a point to any other armor.
---
PS4 id take that deal but I’d try to flip them quick to something I wanted.  Next patch is coming up and there’s no telling what nonsense may occur and introduce another dupe bug, rendering them potentially worthless.
---
Dude YouTube music has a fallout radio that plays all the songs from every fallout and songs that would fit it that universe
---
Yes, but there are not really strong attacks! 😁 the super mutants are at lvl 5 🤷
---
I like the western revolver but they went old school with it. It feels like you’re shooting a bolt action it’s so slow and you reload it one shot at a time lol. Anyway, I carry one to tag legendaries, as I know I one tap a lot of things. It’s favorited on my wheel, takes 1 sec to pull out.
---
This is my favorite bush wookie moment so far. Enough that I had to save the video and share it way too often. 
---
https://youtu.be/ynI_Du1l4ME
---
Top tier man
---
What's your leveling route and routine? I feel like I'm either getting inaccurate leveling each day despite being unyielding bloody build..... Like it's definitely getting harder to level up, obviously since I'm 265 now... But I feel there has to be a better method.
---
Good advice. I’ll post it on the market in case there’s people that want to trade for them. After all I’m just at lvl 100 and still in need of cool guns
---
That is a good point and true.
---
On PC theyre already worthless
---
Dm me, maybe we can play together some time as I plan on restarting
---
And there's so many broken things in this game ... not necessarily in a broken and useless state like explosive weapons, flamethrowers, energy damages in general being bad because of their bad energy resist calculation, quest dialogues being a complete nonsense sometimes ... but also broken in a OP state like those legendary affixes doing way more damages than they should for whatever reason. And I'm still discovering new ones almost every day.
---
So have you actually tried completing The Importance of Communication? That might fix things, who knows.
---
Keep in mind, Dailies reset at 8 PM Eastern time.
---
It's a thing when you hit max scrip but not for the daily cap.
---
Maybe she ran out of Raiders to kill?
---
True but it also costs you 200-300 acid to make that lead, Gym theft costs zero acid, just press T once instead of enter 100-200 times
---
They sourced most of the music from 2 companies, both of which don't exist anymore since the release of the game.
---
One was a government funded archive, which lost government funding. The other, a company specializing in restoring and digitizing old music, was bought out by another company.
---
Bethesda has to put more money into getting music now from other sources, which is why we aren't getting "new" old music, besides some covers that they added.
---
Not a bug, working as intended. You have to do the *Importance of Communication* quest to get the *Retirement Plan* next day. They share the cd, and alternate day by day. You can only have one of them active at the same time. Only on the very first day, when you start doing those quests you get them both.
---
I just found out about the glitch that let go go through walls so when you see nuke right after another like that is because of the glitch
---
haha that's gold. I played with a friend the other day who hadn't seen the ghillie suit in action. I hid in a bush and they said I was practically invisible. 
---
My theory is that most regulars are constantly on the move, and are trained to look for other players on the move as well. Staying still is an extra form of camo.
---
It's even worse! I just peeked at my NW: Kill other players challenge. 20 kills. I'm so ashamed.
---
some armour has to be the best. There is always something at the top... SS just happens to be it.  Feel free to wear whatever you like though.
---
Also worth noting that when someone 4 times your lvl invit you in a group during an event involving a legendary (like the one where you gotta play instruments at night, forgot the name) ... accept the invit damnit.
---
Ended up missing the legendary because I didn't want to one shot it but the 3 other "noobs" who refused to join my group just killed it while I had a chance to tag it.
---
Depends on your build
---
Oh no. I'm just trying to pace myself so I hit 20 kills when I reach level 100. No need to rush myself.
---
The two quests do not strictly alternate - you can get the same one several days in a row.
---
I don't mind if they can't use licensed music and would just have covers, or even just make some in house compositions, but do something! It's so monotonous. Between the constant recycling of the handful of songs they've been using for years or semi ambient dead silence, the audio options suck.
---
Is this a legacy camp spot? I thought they patched out the green zone there.
---
People were a little slow on PS4 took them a while to find out how to dupe the plans😂.
---
Just to add since i only just found your post on a random google search. This BoS should theoretically be very different than all previous chapters. It's the first time we've seen Brotherhood that worked directly under Maxson, who really had more of a Minuteman ideology than Taggerdy or later BoS groups. Bethesda has a bit of a crush on them, so I'm willing to bet these guys will have a fundamentally different perspective. 
---
Most likely they will still get in a fight with the Raiders and the Settlers seem extremely judgmental and will see tech-focused soldiers as a threat, so a 1v1v1 between 3 factions. It is most likely we will have to be cooperative with the BoS as a lot of the new mission types we see this year are releasing with the Brotherhood storyline and will probably be assigned through them. Expeditions would make sense as a BoS event if they just finished a 10-year expedition to Appalachia.
---
FALLOUT76 ISNT AN MMORPG SO DONT EXPECT AN ENDGAME... 
---
You basically fuck around with your friends farming resource and getting legendary gears and farming treasury note for gold bullion and SS gear 
---
but it isn’t raids or dungeons like destiny or FFXIV that for sure (not yet atleast)
---
It’s been this way since Daggerfall. Modders fix the bugs and shortcomings. This is the first time they’ve prevented third parties from fixing issues. Imagine the previous releases without modders and how terribly buggy they are patched.  That’s why there’s so many requests for fixes and why bugs generally have been laughed off because an entire unpaid army cleaned up the mess. Now that has been prevented so the full stain is seen and experienced. Todd won’t admit it, but modding made Bethesda, not him.
---
No you can't. I have been doing the quests on 3 different characters from the day wastelanders launched. And it has always alternated, on every one of my toons. That is roughly 300 quests so far that has **always** alternated. If you have gotten same quest two times in a row then you must have skipped a day from the game.
---
The only possible explanation is that there is no quality control, nothing gets tested, people gave them so much feedback during the PTS and they fixed nothing, also support is garbage, you cant sent pics or videos and i bet most of us get a generic reply by someone who crosses his fingers wishing we do not reply so that he can close our ticket as "resolved",that is if he bothers to reply at all. I stopped my subscription for fallout 1st, if enough people do the same maybe they will start to care,
---
I have 500,000 22M and I still don’t have enough
---
this is silly, and I'm all for denouncing Nazis
---
Many times I would go get my daily and spawning it would pop up that I started it. But I had to manually make it active to talk to them.
---
Good spot
---
I have had this happen to me a few times over the last few days.  One of them punched me to death.  Lol  I recently started playing NW and have managed to make it to rank 58 by being an unarmed bush Wookiee.
---
Juicehead explained a possible way to avoid this in one of his videos.
---
Basically, you log off no sooner than 15 minutes before the challenges reset. After challenges reset, wait 15 minutes before hopping back on. When you get back on, join a public world.
---
My time zone and the fact that I rarely use my private world is why I have never had challenges auto complete.
---
I'm dying and having to shoot more today, but I have seen a bunch of rubberbanding health bars and mobs that I can hear but can't see that blink in and out. I dunno
---
You’re not going to get Retirement Plan while Importance of Communication is active. 
---
Go get the tubes and turn them in to Wren. Then Retirement Plan will likely pop.
---
That's awesome! Who is that music by?
---
My toon is level 180 and only recently "put her big girl panties on" and started joining in on SBQ and Sheepsquatch events. About 800 hours (ish) 
---
My little girl is all grown up now lol
---
I just want it back to kit out my low level mule. Lol.
---
? Why they got heavily duped. There’s loads about. As op stated he brought 3 from the same guy. There’s a clue there if u look!
---
You said it yourself. Imposter Sheepsquatch. Finally something challenging and no one ever shows up. I’ve had to abandon the last three, including one I paid for.
---
The Christmas scorched had far less annoying sounds.
---
Christmas scorched were awesome. The mole miner event was shit.
---
Agreed. Test more and listen to the people on the damn test servers.
---
Fasnacht needed to be more challenging and have some variety to it.
---
murgle also, she lives in the ash heap and runs a coffee shop next door to me
---
If you think the mole miners were better than Fasnacht you are a moron :)
---
Well you shouldn’t have been trying to hide in my bush in power armor. I don’t need everyone knowing there’s targets in my vicinity. 
---
Also extra kill is extra xp for placement and kill itself. And a piñata of chems and ammo.
---
I'm on PC
---
Imo this god you could save it as you’ll never know if you would run bloodied one day
---
Yeah
---
I think the issue is just pricing. They might make more money off the atom shop if they lowered the prices, and we probably wouldn't mind it as much. It's easier to justify 5 bucks on a power armor skin as opposed to 15. In addition to that, keeping more items around more often would do plenty. It's a shame the shop is basically empty once you buy what's featured that week.
---
I killed 2 the other day but I waited till we were down to the final 10 with the smallest map. Had to thin the heard. There can only be one.
---
oh, i was going to give you some stuff if you were on ps4
---
There is an atom challenge for scrapping 76 pieces of power armor. scrap 'em.
---
Did the ally quests day 1 of Wastelanders then scrapped headache space lady and beckett
---
Whether this has 15 or 10,000 upvotes, it is still an underrated comment. It’s details like this that MAKE the experience.  “....someone’s nuking fissure site prime...again.” 😂 we need the NPCs to respond to player activity.
---
Yes I did, was unaware that it was glitched. Thanks.
---
People won't pay for low level power armors (or high level as they are easy to get), or if someone would, it will be extremely hard to find such buyer. The amount of scrap you would get is also very minimal amount.
---
I personally would give them away to a friend or some random newbie. Or put on for sale on your vendor for really low amount of caps so some lowbie can pick it up.
---
Agreed, but it should make some sort of sense in the lore. I would love to work for the Enclave, but this would be like if Dick Richerson and a squad of soldiers walked his way over from the Oil rig to set up shop in the Whitesprings. Its just doesn't make much sense. It would be neat to do something new or see a new faction. Maybe Remains of a Pre War military unit or a something else. Its just annoying that its the BoS and that the BoS is going to be the focus of a lion share of the content for the next few seasons.
---
I'm glad people like the BoS, I honestly do as well. I also will gladly play any content we get. However, it just feel like its a BoS overload, and a miss chance to do something new.
---
I don't think you'll get a lot of takers for power armor because PA in general isn't that rare. See if the scrap has worthwhile resources for you, otherwise sell them to NPC vendors
---
Yep, I second this. Players don't really want to buy it, and vendors won't give you much for it.
---
You're on PC, right? Lmk if you need anything like ammo or plans. I have a terrifying crapload of extra plans on my mule.
---
I switched servers and it hasn’t been a problem for me since
---
I wouldn't bother trying to sell them. It's a ton of weight that most likely wont sell very quickly, if at all. Scrapping them should count towards the weekly challenge at least.
---
Yeah this shit is half my stash hahaha
---
Go on the market Reddit right now on ps4 and ask to get one for 30k or even 50 it won't happen. Say you have one for 30k and watch someone offer easily 50k/50k 556 or maybe even a legacy. Yeah there is a clue there😉
---
Yup. I always hated this.
---
Yeah and I’ve unlocked most of the Christmas and all the Halloween gear now
---
&gt; You can only have one of them active at the same time. 
---
That is quite simply not true, since I definitely did have them both active at least one time other than the first time you do them, because I didn't finish one of the two on the day I got it, then got the other one on the next day. Given how buggy the quest system is in this game I would not be surprised if strict alternation were the intended behaviour and what I saw was a glitch, but there you go.
---
Hey did they ever update this to provide rads? Someone says yes the rest say no. Thanks for any info! It's on sale in shop this week, I have standard barrel but gf wants to pick this up, but only if it provides rads!
---
Never said it would. People with them think they’re going to get double legacy and B2525 fixers. Look how many posts there are trading the plan in the last few days and look how many got what they’re asking for.
---
What is a legacy and magic weapon?
---
The scrip thing, I crafted some Secret Service armor for the 1st time yesterday and instantly regretted it, had to stop playing as I am always full of legendaries I can't get rid of.
---
I would have loved to donate my 300 bottles of nuka cola rather than selling them...(yes I have a problem...but it's just so good!)
---
why didn't you sever hop as soon as you got glitched?
---
I'm level 280 on my main. I gave a level 65 a fully modded set of X01. I was going to just build him a jetpack for his but didn't feel like moving flux so I gave him a spare set I wasn't using. Jet pack, calibrated shocks, tesla Bracers, targeting hud. Quantum paint. He didn't even know what calibrated shocks were. Everyone helps low levels but sometimes forgets the level 50 to 85 if they're on their first play through. I made his day lol.
---
Technically the stations would be stuck with whatever songs were in the playlist when the bombs dropped...
---
They could add a mission to add new songs to the local radio stations playlist though. That’d be fun.
---
Or. For such a rare plan is it not strange how many of them there are??  Op managed to buy 3 from one player. See if u can get 2 mire salve plan. Let alone 3. That’s a rare plan. The backpack has been heavily duped. I know someone who has 6 on his account.
---
This is my Bloody Explosive Shotgun build. It doesn't have to be bloodied, but I've included all the sneak perks because my last B/E shotgunner kept getting killed. You can adjust accordingly.

---
Real question. Are people allowed to say this game is trash yet? Or do I have to declare my undying love to Todd Howard's genius vision that is Fallout 76?
---
Wouldn’t necessarily be against this. But with how atoms are, I’d like to find them in the world more.
---
Heres a little slot machine game i did in godot adlessgames.com
---
I ended up switching servers about 5 times and finally found one with level 25 enemies everywhere, ghouls and robots
---
Let’s be honest would it be a fallout game with out a brotherhood? It works here because you can see the brotherhood and see what they turned into in later games.
---
Also Military sells in games.
---
featuring Herman Menderchuk, I hope.
---
I’m pretty sure I was one of em😂 but I did get what I want for the crocs I got for less. I started from trading my leather coat for those crocs then went and got a red asylum for them. And so on where as now I have 2 good legacies
---
Sorry I know this thread is a few days old now. Just wanted to add, while I agree communication would be should be better, we're talking about multiple studio branches with different people working on a random assignment daily. As with any office job, there isn't usually much order to what someone is working on, just that it's on their list. Bethesda, for as much as we get frustrated with their PR, is way quicker at responding to issues and is one of the few AAA companies I know of that have a community team for responding on forums other than on their own website. 
---
Hopefully it will be improved but it seems like a lot of moving parts to get everyone on the same page. Game developers that I know would be more frustrated having to explain the problem and relay that effectively to staff rather than just fixing the problem themselves and saying it's done.
---
I took the cat and the kids remember
---
When I first got me a nice gun (instigating explosive railway rifle) and for the first time began one shooting hard enemies. About that time I got all the SS Armor plans a crafted a partially vanguard set. The Jetpack mod I put on It just made the game sooooo much fun.
---
Nowadays I've switched my build to bloodied and I'm enjoying It massively
---
I use a magic bloodied gauss minigun
---
You should definitely do it
---
You'll usually find him upstairs... alive or dead.
---
Red asylum was duped to hell as well. That’s not an upgrade. I have 3 legacy’s. They’re not hard to get. Are the two u have a BE+p plasma gat and either a BE flamer or a BE laser by any strange chance?
---
I actually run egg head to make up the intelligence I lose with all my other mutations lol.
---
It also works on gauss miniguns because of the explosive damage, it counts as two shots, doubling the rof for magic.
---
if you have a bloodied+/magical roll on it, expect to melt literally every mob in the game, nothing can stop you whatsoever if you're spec'd for it and have all the right perks
---
Short Answer: Yes.
---
Long Answer: Yes, especially if you play a lot. The stated benefits all by themselves are pretty amazing.
---
The stash box is worth the money all by itself. Not having to sweat the inventory management as much is super nice. Although it doesn't completely solve the problem it's super helpful.
---
The monthly atoms allotment is nice too. If you buy atoms anyway then this is a no brainer. 
---
I absolutely love the survival tent. Although I wish there was a way to scrap weapons and armor there and not just junk, but I guess you can't have everything.
---
Now the private world has some un-stated benefits.
---
* It gives you a way to transfer items relatively safely by yourself. Just dump items into a cigarette machine and bring in your alt to pick up the items. I've never lost anything this way, yet. I have heard of others having their game crash and the world getting trashed before they got back.
---
* Makes getting resources a breeze since every time you log into your fresh server everything is there. No one else has looted areas. So as long as something should be there it will be there.
---
* If you want to do stuff like launch nukes and stuff like that alone the private server is the way to go. I like doing those kinds of things with other people, but there is definitely something to be said for being able to roll by yourself in solitude.
---
As for as the cost I figure you could spend nearly $100 going to the movies that will last for 3 hours or you could throw $100 at Fallout First and get way more than 3 hours worth of entertainment.
---
I get that it's not perfect, but I've gotten a lot more joy out of Fallout 76 than the money I've spent on it. Fallout First has been an improvement to that and one that I don't regret at all.
---
Plus, tbh I like to support the development of the things I enjoy or are useful to me. I enjoy Fallout 76 with all its flaws.
---
Just my two cents.
---
Unfortunately no, I got AAE gat plas and FE railway. Last message mate I got to sleep reddit is killing me😂
---
I'm keeping several full sets in my stash for when/if they ever make Displays for PA
---
I agree but I also wish that either the DJ talked less and/or they added a station that played the music with no talking.
---
It's still a big adjustment for me to see NPCs and having her talk in between every song is shocking and really annoying. I don't care about your life story just play some Old Man Moe.
---
What self respecting bush wookie is running around it power armor?   If I see PA I remove all the armor pieces and the fusion core then gradually drop them in various bushes.
---
🏅 🎖 🥇
---
Well your wrong cause I just traded one for a DE50 Gatling Laser. And my brother traded one for a B2525 Fixer a few days ago. I can easily provide pics if you would like 😊. That's for your comment below. As well I bought 2 mire plans for a B2525 During the Dupe😉. As op stated he's on PS4 the economy is completely different then PC/ even xbox which your on.
---
Yep I get that lol.
---
Right thanks, I have an ok melee build, I die a few times at West Tek but generally can handle myself. I will check out the general steak house and harpers, I don't frequent those two places at all but will give it a try. I know I have gone literally around the map to avoid breaking the public team hunting legendaries and find few or none, I could easily spend an hour and not a single legendary.
---
Yeah I don't get upset, I just find it a little lame someone can see you doing leader of the pack, like yesterday, I literally killed the leader in the middle of the forrest and this level 54 comes thumping thru in his PA, no way would he have left it for me as it would have been a panic kill. He immediately fast travelled to the 2nd horde event probably hoping or thinking it was a legendary as well, I was chuckling, think, thanks for doing that and checking off an event on my weekly ..
---
Yup. Best of luck. I’m still trying to get a good one. Got a two star two shot so far best one.
---
I named my vampire explosive LMG the “Bhvagad Gita.”
---
This was taught to us in history class when I was in school. I feel like they don’t teach stuff from the early to mid 1900’s like they used to.
---
Lol. No you didn’t. The mire plans A never got duped and 2 are rarer than hens teeth. I’ll call bullshit on your entire post
---
Speed demon is really only useful with a handful of weapons. Mainly heavy.
---
I didn't even realize it had a door because I see no prompt and it has never closed. It has power and everything since the rocket is flaming and the lights are on.
---
I totally expected to hear it when I started playing and realized there was a mining theme.
---
The moral of the story with legendaries is that gauss is the answer.  It's so much easier to get a good gauss weapon because you are only rolling stats instead of stats and weapons.
---
Scrap a lot, craft bulk materials and sell them at your vendors. Ammo is also a constante cap resource. Be in a 4 people public group and you'll be making some money when companions complete events. Kill everyone, sell every gun if you have it's mods
---
I think they know this and it sorta terrifies them, I can't think of another reason they didnt leverage this social aspect when going online with a game community know for modding and creating content. That would have been my main selling point. Honestly you should be able to design levels offline that you can load into a VR lounger for people to wager caps on if they can beat it. Atomic shop could sell mobs and AI packs, as well as all sorts of dungeon construction items. I'm just saying, I would have made a better game and made them more money through atomic shop sales than they are doing now. I hate when shitty products don't even do what they are supposed to - which is rake in cash.
---
Gonna get my freak on tonight...
---
I haven't spent a cent on this broken mess of a game outside of the original beta purchase, nor will I ever.  That only rewards bad behavior.  I have 28k atoms from challenges hoarded away, should they ever have anything else on there that I want and isn't broken.  At this rate, I'll probably never use them all.  I will never preorder another game from them again after all this, and if I do play one, it will be a used purchase from a reseller in a bargain bin a year or more after release, so zeniscum gets nothing for it, and I can return it if it's just more broken garbage.  They also want to start shoving their political BS in their customers' faces, so that was the final nail.  Their actions have cost them lifetime customers, and it shows as they get more desperate in their cash grab attempts.  I would encourage people to speak with their wallets, as that's all they will listen to...
---
Aw man, everybody just handing stuff out lol
---
But thanks for the offer!
---
Yeah. I was about to do it when some challenge appeared. Then it told me I had to remove my mods and I didn't have the patience to remove them.
---
I'd scrap it. I too am not real big on power armor. I prefer a more stealthy approach to the game. 
---
IMHO you only really need a suit of Excavator Power Armor for mining purposes.
---
Nuclear winter razing the place actually fits pretty well. My guess is every expansion to the game will progress time by a year or more and eventually one of the crises we will face will be ZAX posing some threat to Appalachia. Even if it does burn, our characters in-game don't know it and would be rebuilding as if nothing will happen. Chances are there will be a continual stream of new threats coming to Appalachia with every update, because if appalachia was successfully rebuilt to prewar condition before the events of fallout 3 it would make no sense. If they don't keep introducing events that prevent or undo the rebuilding they will have to eventually fast forward time to after the events of Fallout 4 to keep from continually running afoul of canon. Hey, maybe they could cryo freeze us (neva been done befoe) so that the rest of us survive ZAX burning the place while one of us defeats him in 2108, and we just accidentally get left in the freezer for 200 years (neva).
---
It sounds like your an adult 
---
Don’t let kids and teenagers get under your skin , no your not a jerk but don’t get stress out or over think the situation. Don’t let kids get under your skin bro
---
Noob-ness is relative. Like when you have to explain to people how to play Encryptid or something, you're not the noob. Then some lvl 20 is like "I need help finishing the Enclave quest" and you're like, "how are you already doing Enclave quests" and it makes you feel like a noob all over again.
---
Yeah, it happens to me sometimes, but I just reload and it fixes itself.  I wonder if its speed demon
---
I was actually looking for shotgun plans as I'm trying to make a build that focuses on shotguns. Turns out I don't have any! Just been using what I pick up and modifying it. So far the double barrel has been blowing everything away. 
---
I was also trying to find a plan for that lever action rifle that uses the .45 ammo. I think it's just called "lever action rifle." I just discovered it yesterday and it's a pretty handy backup. 
---
Got any shotgun plans in your massive stash?
---
You know that you can check your bush coverage by going into photomode right? I always pop into it to check my visibility when I find a new hiding spot and usually stay in it until I need to check the safe zone location. It makes it easier to watch people run around and fight each other too. I used to pop out when people started getting close but I was always killed anyway so now I just stay in to get a better view of my last moments.
---
BLUE MOON! BLUE MOON!
---
I feel like this is worse with magic heavies and killing the SBQ in 10-30 seconds where people don’t land enough damage to qualify for event rewards. In fact someone was launching successive nukes and then killing the queen in like 10 seconds freezing everyone out. So on the third nuke I killed the queen with my gauss mini before he could land a shot. He was pissed but I was like “that’s what it’s like!”
---
Mole Miner event? Christmas Scorched? What and when did i miss this stuff?
---
Sorry man but I have no idea how to fix it on an Xbox
---
If you really want to drive it home, there's a recording of Oppenheimer talking about it on YouTube.  
---
It's genuinely haunting.
---
I have this problem with a friend on Xbox for the past month or two, definitely before the ban/unban wave, and we too tried everything with no luck, and it's exactly what you've described, I can't see him on my Social Menu but he can see, join and invite me normally. I don't know which platform you're using, but the 'workaround' I use is to just join his game through the friendslist on the Xbox dash.
---
I've observed high levels don't have vendors or their vendors have pretty mediocre weapons and armor. I think that the reason is that mantain vendors is a lot of effort and they prefer to trade good stuff than selling It.
---
I'm level 242 now and keeping my vendors is on my favourite task of the game. I always try to have adictive and bloodied two stars and good outfits plus tons of serums and ammo
---
My vending machines are barely on anymore because I have nearly everything I want and I'm always close to max caps lol. My characters are level 200 and 280.
---
" I am a huge Enclave fan boy "  
---
Just.... why?
---
Even better let me scrip everything and give me IOU scrip papers like treasury notes so I dont have to choose between having a mule with 500 pounds of scrip or throw stuff on the ground
---
Lol yes I did now I know your a Fucken idiot because they were easily just as dupable as the Croc BP as I saw someone do it😂 your a literally joke kid who is l brain-dead if you think those can't/didn't get duped. I'm done talking to you lol your a joke and just plain stupid PCE out bud✌️ and you below tried to say how worthless they were how guessing he got a BE15 gat/laser and he got something better. Your on Xbox you've proven you have no clue how much there worth on ps4 so maybe stick to your platform😉
---
I will generally use my handmade or revolver to tag them. Then signal for the others to come. Unfortunately this won't work if they are melee builds around
---
Thanks for the heads up. 😭
---
&gt; It's the first time we've seen Brotherhood that worked directly under Maxson, who really had more of a Minuteman ideology than Taggerdy or later BoS groups.
---
The problem with that assessment is that the group that's coming in has made it pretty clear that they're of the Feudal Lord/Fallout 4 Maxson ideology with the content and tone of their messages. Hence my whole post.
---
yeah i'm at 208 right now and cant' spend money/scrip fast enough... and there really isn't anything I don't have. Out of habit and my love for FO, I still log in every day.  Only thing I don't I don't have are 100% bullion items... .so I grind ( don't mind grind).
---
No prob. Luck only affects the condition of looted items, not the durability. In other words, it doesn't affect the size of the durability bar, just how much it's filled/overfilled. 
---
I don't know what the Luck requirement is for max condition, but I believe you can loot items with up to 200% condition if you have enough luck.
---
I found instigating superesasy to use at the begining. A good instigating weapon doesn't really need an orthodoxe build, it's enough to set the propper cards for It
---
A bluegrass station would be EVERYTHING.
---
Lol. Ok. I can read your previous posts u know 😂😂😂
---
Eh, who doesn't like a good underdog story? Plus, cool tech and the desire to make America human again.
---
Honestly,  it's fun to be the badguys from time to time, and it would be cool to be able to join up with them, kinda like joining Cesar
---
The radio host kind of highlighted how limited the music selection is. I think she was a great addition, but without more tracks her lines get just as repetitive as the music.
---
But i picked up 4K acid at Fasnacht from the beehives, so it’s really a non-issue!
---
But they are so much more than just "military"
---
In many ways they are the narrating faction of the franchise. Their role is the preservation of knowledge for humanity in the future. Most post-apoc stories have a faction like this that serves in a similar capacity. Many of those stories cannot be told without someone performing this role, as they are the keepers of the knowledge of old needed to move the story forward.
---
They are the franchise faction of tech preservers moreso than military. But I kind of agree with you, if the BoS isn't in it in some form I would question if it was actually a fallout game.
---
If you don't mind me asking are you full health or low health mele?
---
Wrong forum :p
---
I aqua boy Wookiee-d it last night and found power armor.  I love power armor because it makes hiding underwater easier to control.  Luck was in my side and the circle kept closing around a deep waterway, I hopped in and hid under a rock overhang and found 3 other fellow extreme hide and seekers.  We ended up being the final 4 and when I found out they were a team who never won I threw myself into the fire.  Good times.
---
Cool, and how?
---
Sit all of them in the flatwoods church.  Low levels would probably love to have them.
---
I don't understand, I have for the last three days in a row?
---
Instigating is super nice. One shot most everything regardless of build. Just spec into the weapon with a few perks and you're gtg.
---
Please tell me that you wear a clown mask with the outfit and equip a knife and role play as the Pint-Sized Slasher lol. 
---
Tranquility Lane is one of my favorite parts in the entire Fallout series. It’s so creepy and I love it.
---
You are a star, thanks very much! A lot of confusion around these things, prob due to what's stated in game ya know!
---
-
---
Same with INT, unless, what the game  is actually refering to, is using the relative Perk Cards for extra Durability. Confusing! HeHe
---
Thanks again!!
---
I run a junkies build so any upgrade to my guns can't be bought with caps unless I get really lucky. So I do the same thing as you. And occasionally if my caps get low I just sell something from my stash to get them back up lol.
---
Why did u delete your last post?  You know the one with u offering the backpack and getting offers of duped plans????  😂😂 and the reason the mire wasn’t and hasn’t been duped is because next to nobody has it to dupe. I can’t remember the last time one came up for trade
---
Nope I posted this bug in detail about 15 minutes ago.
---
Except I've been able to do Retirement Plan for the last three days in a row without needing to do Communication, like I said.
---
If it's not a bug then it's just you get a random one of two regardless of what you still have available--what kind of weird ass design is that?
---
Haven't had to for the last few days.
---
Really?
---
Yeah, checked &amp; they're all selected.
---
Ahaha lol yeah
---
I don't think it's that rare you can server hop and get it from a ranger station I think.
---
And they are far from the first to post about it.
---
Its was in the atom shop twice
---
&gt;keeps adding new prototype/experiment
---
Most of that stuff doesn't even have lore attached :/
---
The reload animation is Cuckoo bananas with the mime equipped. 
---
The effect goes away when you change weapons, but a quick unequip/reequip of the mine resolves this. Hopefully this effect is hanging around for awhile!
---
When you trade with yourself, log both characters in at the same location first.  Then drop the item (I've had the best luck with the blue suitcase at whitesprings station) into the container and log out to the main menu.  Log back in asap (within a couple minutes or so) with the mule character and grab the stuff.  You'll likely never lose anything.  Never, ever drop the stuff in a bag.
---
Thank u for ur time
---
Kids in the hall is the shit. Dave Foley is the man
---
Yes you cant see my post because I delete and repost all the time you dumbfuck because I constantly trade and don't want to clutter  I kept the good one where I got offered a DE50 Laser for you to see. Obviously your blind dumbass was to stupid to look what I turned down(DE50)😊 so go be a useless waste of skin who knows nothing and should probably just do the world a favor and end things. like are you actually stupid or what lol and go back more you'll see what I've got traded for them 😊. Your a joke and stupid like man I'm sorry your so fucken brain-dead learn shit before you open your fucken mouth😂 so go look at that one and see that it's easily possible now PCE out again you brain-dead fuck who's IQ seems to be that of a Fucken squirrels.
---
Maybe put up a big sign at your camp saying "I am a Mule Alt"?
---
Um I did not mean atomic I meant in game
---
I loved the event, just hated the lunch pails.  Like really, really hated them.  The good stuff was insanely hard to get.  I still think I hear the morse code when I am in the ash heap.
---
If they do it again, it should be in an area that has max level enemies.
---
I love this guy.   I collect those ‘You’ve been insulted’ notes for when people decide they wanna go pvp.   Wipe them out, find their stuff, slip one of those notes in, and take everything else.
---
They don't even have a flag you can place in your camp, and the stuff that is in game is just ported assets from fallout 4 for the most part. There is serious room for growth.
---
What do you play on...Console? Pc? I'm on ps4 and might be able to help
---
Oh yeah, there's a radio
---
I took this after I got home from work and it's unedited but you can see it happen a couple of times.
---
[https://youtu.be/tGwPGkRvpak](https://youtu.be/tGwPGkRvpak)
---
First time it's happened to me, all my dailies are auto completed. I quit to menu as always about 4 hours before reset and i logged in 3 hours after reset. I have done nothing different to all the other days I play the game and don't have this happen, so I honestly don't think there is a trigger. Its strange that my NW quest is also autocomplete, never seen thay before on any posts. I'm at rank 71 so it's not a worry for me to loose out on a single level up and none of my weekly quests were autocomplete.
---
Beth has no idea what's going on or how to fix it, they ask you to submit a report so that you feel like there is some kind of closure, but it won't be fixed and nobody will be compensated. Won't stop me playin or enjoying the game in anyway though, I just hope it doesn't happen again
---
You mean the Enclave that created the Scorchbeasts? That one? Yeah, they are so much better. ;D
---
OK mate you're missing part of the story. If you both are getting worked up over the cow, you're probably too new to know what you did.
---
100% mate, until I got my first good gun in the game, an Instigating Explosive Railway Rifle, I was struggling with tough creatures. I hardly reached de 1000 damage to loot the Queen. That gun was a true game changer. I went bloodied a time ago but I still keep It (despite of it's weight) because I love that piece of junk
---
So would I have. Double doesn’t give double ammo it’s just the name the buff got removed so it’s basically a poor weapon and was heavily duped. You’re funny. Dunno why your lying. Good luck with getting your b2525 fixer or whatever it is your trying for with the croc plan. Id shift it fast by the weekend you’ll be picking them up for 8-10k like the bear arm and back back plans.....maybe yiu could trade the mire salve plans u have? They’re worth a fortune. But of course. U don’t have them do you 😂😂😂
---
Im on xbox
---
I'm starting to think the bug is that I got the quest at all without alternating... This game, I don't even.
---
Dang!
---
I hadn’t heard all that about it,I heard ya had too rebuild yer camp &amp; such for the application,but for all that to be bugged as well,DaAaAaNg.
---
Hopefully they figure that ish out quick.
---
Edit:Just to say If true,yer PSA was def worth the effort,TY
---
His armor and build must have been pretty rough too then. Lol poor guy
---
No lol. It’s a massive bug. My gf and I ditched our junkies ultracite heavy builds because of this. Nothing like having 40 fusion cores in your inventory but all of them only have ~50 shots left. You just don’t notice it with other weapons because you’re not reloading mags at 5% capacity lol. But it happens on all my guns.
---
Perhaps it's time to roll some alts. I got 4 characters atm. Quite a lot of good stuff to spend some hard earned caps, lol.
---
idk abt plague walker, it’s sort of just... there. It doesn’t hurt to have or anything or have any downsides IIRC, but the poison aura is negligible
---
I still need a legacy weapon. But have no idea about who's selling.
---
Yeah we know
---
Yeah his perk cards were all over the place so he couldn’t craft beans. I crafted him a jet pack for his ultracite armor as well. But really the dbl barrel with bashing (a magic quality) at least gives him a fighting chance. Oh and I forgot I also gave him a *** gauss rifle with furious and FFR.
---
I’ve had a lot of success with the radstags one with the death claw at level 3, from experience only one animal alive still gets you the good stuff, I’ve also noticed the other two animals dying  make it so the sheepsquatch will spawn with you and it’s the easiest one to kill
---
And you reload the highest count core. So when you’ve used your last full core you’re left with 40 cores at ~50 rounds lmao.
---
I think I am going to craft lvl 20, 30 fixers to hand out.
---
yeah, this seems to be one of the causes. Anytime you unsuccessfully load a character it bugs the challenges out if its the first time you've logged in for the day.
---
Dupers galore? They are never going to make the daily scrip limit unlimited for a reason.
---
Of course there is. I'm just thinking it would be better for them not to be the focus of the last haft and the 2 following seasons after it. Then again, slightly bass due to how little content my two favor factions (Free states and Enclave) have
---
They are not anymore anti-science in 4 than they are in any other game. The institute and it's research were a direct threat to the future of humanity. They are the product of potentially world destroying science. Synths, teleportation, FEV, all of these things totally fall under their mandate to keep dangerous technology out of the hands of those who would abuse it.
---
Destroying the institute makes perfect sense from their standpoint, they wouldn't use any of those technologies regardless of it being more "advanced" than some of their own science. It's just like the mutation serums in 76, no self-respecting brother is going to use them because of how they came about.
---
Never thought about using photo mode in NW. Thank you
---
This. Gets a camp and fill it with 6 large water filters. Take all the water and sell it. Got my first 5k caps that way
---
Sinatra
---
Its the internet, where men are men and so are 3/4 of the women.
---
You want more handouts?
---
Which literally makes no sense at all. Was what they got your purchase after tax? Didn't think so
---
Ohhhh shit, i did the settler raid yesterday and i was wondering why Jen was acting like Agent Mochou died. I was so confused lmao i thought she died on the way to foundation or in a battle
---
Your a Fucken dumbass😂 you just contradicting yourself saying you couldn't get a double for it😂 like you actually are stupid holy shit lol. And it's still worth a shit ton especially on PS4. Want me to show you my B2525 Fixer you useless waste of skin?😊 I'll send you a picture of it if you want😊 oh yes because there price is going down because the dupe is still going on😂 like how brain-dead are you seriously.. there price is just going to go up now that the dupes been patched and it's unobtainable for now. Why would I trade my last more plan? Did you not read my post I LEARNED one and have one like I said I'll send you a picture of it learned and my extra if your dumbass wants. Like holy shit your stupid how do you even dress yourself if you think the price is going to go down😂
---
I've been there. Hell I just recently finished my build and I'm 189 lol didn't realize some of the perks pertain to things they do t specifically say. Like granadier, has a picture of granades didn't think it would help the radius of explosive handmade.
---
&gt; I think Enclave is much more interesting than any other faction.
---
You're calling the BoS villians and espousing the enclave in the same post?   
---
You do know they are responsible for killing everyone in Appalachia right?
---
Wow. You really are cancer
---
This happens on all platforms from the looks of it.
---
But if you have a 9 scrip item and only 8 scrip left that day then its already adding up because you lost out on that 8 scrip permanently. Having a limit today just makes it even harder to meet the limit tomorrow
---
Grinding players of Appalachia, unite!
---
That's the stuff I like from the store. Either something useful or funny.
---
Honestly I run a bloodied unarmed build and I love it. I can also instantly respec to a high health (or bloodied) heavy gun PA build without spending perk points! I do around 7000 damage while sneaking to the SBQ which is just awesome. I would recommend staying bloody for PvE but have heavy gunner and PA perks as a back up for PvP.
---
Thanks mate, I knew it was an historical quote but couldn't place it
---
Well, the reds won, didn't they??
---
I get you, but also: Spotify.
---
I kind of hope, if it ever comes back, Mole Miners'll be more aggressive.  
---
Always felt kinda bad chasing down a guy who was not only scared of me, but wouldn't even fight back.
---
Yeah I feel like players who make these rants only hop events and idle in their camps. They don't know how easy it is to acquire scrip.
---
Free States and Raiders have had more content than any other faction in 76 introduced since launch. 
---
The enclave has entire end-game mechanics devoted to it (The entire nuke system)
---
This quote was also referenced with Nick Valentine in FO4 as he says it as well.
---
That's been patched. I have 5 characters with boxes full of scrip. I drop the excess at events...
---
Dude. Your first post u claimed you traded for a de laser. You didn’t as u admitted right after. You can’t even remember your own lies. Your last post which u delete was up at hour. U got offered 2 plans worth 8k each for it. Your a liar. And someone without the intelligence to see even a simple lie through. All u can do is throw insults. It’s kinda embarrassing
---
This. Entire. Time
---
Bethesda told us the communists were destroyed when America was nuked. But they live... Todd is the red menace.
---
Well yes.
---
It won't change untill they either nerf the high damage builds or buff the enemies which there is some plans in the works already to do. 
---
Legacy weapons are another issue even yesterday I was pvping at a workshop and some came along with a  bloodied explosive fixer(legacy I believe). No only could he shot me through walls but he was also permanently invisible somehow.
---
The funniest things is he killed himself more from his own explosive damage.
---
Junkies.  If you search here you'll find some good builds and analysis.  I run it on my alt when I need a break from sneaking around everywhere and its pretty fun.  Damage won't be as high, but still respectable.
---
I try to, but someone one shots them.
---
The desire to make America human again?
---
They are like the cause of everything mutated to begin with, especially in Appalachia. I would argue that the BoS and their very pure-strain human ways represent that notion moreso than the Enclave.   
---
The only enclave we've seen that doesn't involve mutations or FEV in some way are the remnants in NV :/
---
I switched my junkie from sneak commando to PA heavy. I love it. He's a tank. I do have to  carry a cheese gun (je gat plasma) for when I need the extra damage, but my normal gun is a JE gatling. Its a very effective  build. Way better than the sneak commando was IMO. PVP is way too dumb in adventure so it didn't make sense.
---
I’ve made a lot of caps making healing salve (chemist is vital and super-duper helps).
---
I'm level 140+ and I've been playing since FO76 came out and I just recently stopped feeling noobish.
---
My mom and I can kill a Scorchbeast by ourselves and most other creatures (Sheepsquatches don't count). We don't do any specific builds or anything so we can't one shot anything but it doesn't take much effort.
---
I also now am not completely terrified by Project Paradise though I still won't join if no one else is there.
---
I think I know the Appalachia area well now and don't have to run from most creatures (again Sheepsquatch and those bloated feral ghouls don't count) which is why I don't feel like a noob.
---
they’re stashing the profits in offshore tax havens
---
Good lad, I with more unarmered players did this.
---
Last night me and the gang took each spawn point at Uranium Fever and killed all the mobs as they spawned in. It was so much fun!
---
Hahah always happens to me to, luckily I play in public teams with my family so we normally get the legendary if one of us tagged it.
---
Oh I did, but not everyday for two years.
---
Are you serious? I mean, I don’t doubt you lol. That sucks! Thanks for the warning.
---
You're not the first to report this, but the more noise about it the better.
---
It's honestly fun, but the bugs, terrible QOL, and cheaters just ruin it completely for people without the patience to put up with it, myself included
---
The real issue is it stacks with bloodied, I don't think it should.
---
First Queen kill? I bet you really helped bring it down.
---
" Fallout 76 players are generally good, good people. "  
---
Oh man... Just you wait. There are plenty of bad apples in our bunch.
---
I guess I'm different in that regard. I could totally see a fallout game without the BoS. I guess my issue is that they always seem to have a major spotlight now. Fallout 1 they were a faction, powerful due to there hoarding of tech. 2 and NV had them being most hermits who are strong in battle but are seem as the times have passed them bye. In 3 and 4 they are a bloody powerhouse that you have to deal with if you want to progress the story. 
---
I just would prefer something different. America is a big place, with lots of corners and cool places. I would rather see more natural, one off factions based around local lore, ideas and environmental factors ( Mothmen Cult, Minutemen, Great Khans) then see the BoS all the time. I wouldnt be surprised if we had a Fallout on the Moon that there wouldn't be a BoS space force that hids in pre world bunkers.
---
I don't know how many "flamingos" it is, but I think it's not bad at all, like a normal wall maybe.
---
Nah nocturnal is probably the worst thing to have on a legendary
---
I try not to, but admittedly sometimes, like during radiation rumble, I’m just trying to punch before they get to the scavengers and between forgetting that legendaries can just not regenerate if you kill them fast enough and the fact that you have dozens of the same looking ghouls rushing you it can be hard to notice they’re legendary until you’re already swinging.
---
There’s a people that just don’t care and I always follow emote if I see a 2 or 3* and try to distract it so ppl get the best gear they can, just wanted to add we’re not always doing it intentionally. Some events or situations it’s an honest mistake.
---
As with any bunch! I prefer to focus on the many good people I’ve met
---
Damage stacks excessively when hitting same body part, faster than it should.
---
Ah, shame, like the other two stats haha.
---
Chinese proganda, all of it. You just fear our freedoms!.. or our really dumb leadership
---
Oh thanks
---
I saw him last night.  He was walking around on the second floor, instead of sitting in the window.
---
I’m on Xbox but not selling any ultracite. It’s all I can do to keep up with regular 5.56 .45 .308
---
I am an altaholic as well.

Watch this https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs

Dude you are the dumbass here do you want to see how many post I've deleted I repost all the time and decline stuff😂. So because the most recent post I got 1 offer it cancels the double out? Which there's proof right there which you said below you couldnt get. Like how fucken stupid are you there's no lie anywhere you are just to brain-dead to actually read. I'll show you my 2 doubles in my stash if your dumbass wants like holy shit kid how do you survive in life seriously. Look through recent ps4 posts see what they've been traded for. I'm done with you your intelligence is going to rub off on me.✌️
---
1) You need at least three people.  2) Do not give Q control of the experiment (your animals will run instead of attack).  3) Put on friendly fire and use a shishkabob on the friendly animals to heal them between rounds.  4) Profit.
---
And sure as hell won’t be the last. I don’t just do it for the legendary drop. The improved repair kits are also worth it.
---
Use the terminals to remove the turret safety protocols.  They will take out most of the robots
---
Lol ikr !
---
The odd one our is the 2 star armor, the rest you can get to multiples of 5 or 10.  
---
Three 3 star weapons and two 2 star weps or a 3 star armor and two 1 star armors gets you the 150 for each day.
---
Can the aura hurt other players by accident?
---
I wouldn’t think so, because it would enable PvP i think. Though i’m not 100% sure so you could check it if you want
---
I switched to bloodied too. Just switched armor and a couple perks. Still using my Instigating Lever Action. Better damage and all the benefits of bloodied without using a bloodied weapon.
---
Well, stupid of me to say this but I just rebooted my Xbox and it was normal again. Lol
---
To be honest, I just save my legendary farming for solo sweeps of Cranberry Bog, The Mire, and Savage Divide. In Events I stay as far away from legendaries as possible to avoid any drama. Too many people bickering over the outcome.
---
Don't have a bloodied character.
---
Go to section A. That’s the only one I do because it’s better. Killing the radstags aren’t that bad. Don’t worry about getting all three animals. You only really need one.
---
Edit: recently when I did it with a few others we got a 3* legendary deathclaw to protect. It was great.
---
He is way easier than the queen because he is on the floor. First time I saw him I soloed him in about 3-4 min.
---
Cause they are trolls, Jesus
---
Don't feel guilty. Feel proud! Proud that the game is full of awesome people, who love helping each other.
---
I did the same thing a couple days ago for fusion cells. I do keep 100-200 556 at 2c because it goes so fast in case someone really needs some. But I sell everything at 1c and full fusion cores are 75 when I have a lot of them or low on space and 100 when I have space or only a few left.
---
Because Todd Howard and Logical don't mix well
---
Ok. Let’s try explaining this. You claimed u traded a plan yesterday for a de laser. You didn’t. You claim u can get legacy and b2525 fixers yet your own post attracted 2 duped to hell plans. You claim the price isn’t going down yet op just brought 3 for 33k caos each. And all u do us repeat the same insults and still can’t remember your own lies. Where’s your two mire salve plans?  They would 100% get you too end legacy’s you should trade those. But you don’t have them so you. I’m not saying I don’t believe you I’m just saying flat out your a fantasist and a liar.
---
Silos are harder with more people I’d say
---
What?!  You mean something from this company is broken in this game?  How could that be?
---
/sarcasm
---
The Free states had to get that content because they had none in game. There no free states armor, weapons or anything that you can get for free.
---
The Enclave hasn't been touched since it was placed in this game. The BoS at least had the old stuff from Fallout 4 and new gear around there old base sites. The enclave had the Scout armor and the officers uniform added, but nothing else. Heck, other then the Office set, none of these things even have the Enclave logo. And yes, you need to work with the enclave for the endgame, but they still got the short end of the stick with cosmetics
---
Unless your a really low level
---
Max Rep with Raiders and buy plan
---
Plans are Sold by Mortimer with Max rep with the raiders
---
~~You buy it with gold bullion from Reg up at Vault 79.~~
---
[Edit]: I was thinking about the Plasma Caster. As others have correctly said, you buy it from the Raider faction.
---
Bit bored of you now. Gonna say bye bye and leave you to your lies and delusions. 👋
---
It's still is only part of the issue. The exp loss and the items lost from the corpses is the other 2/3rd of the issue.
---
Nope, that's plasma caster
---
Cool im 3/4 of the way to max i'll have it soon
---
I would argue that these types of posts lead people into a false sense of security about the nature of the community. The nice things are awesome, but as a long term player I have to deal with extremely negative transactions among the players nearly every day in some form.
---
The last thing I need is more stuff. Thank you though.
---
Wow this is...dumb. What's the point in getting it then? I was planning to place it on the floor with my giant sheepsquatch plushie. Thank you for helping me avoid a mistake.
---
Ah, right you are.
---
They will refund accidental and/or silly purchases :-)
---
PC unfortunately, appreciate the offer though very much
---
Water wookies tend to be chill probably because they can't easily shoot each other finally finished pacifist playing my way to fur lined jacket
---
Oh nice, thanks
---
Remove the stealth bonus and legendary effect damage combo. They damage multipliers reach something like 7 times the base weapon damage.
---
I will see if i can find a screen record tool and upload a vid of my AR freaking out. Unfortunately I sold the FFR version so i cant show the 'bad' variant of it vs this magic 33%VATS version
---
Try turning on the damage numbers, I'm pretty sure they would show all over the place - which is what I find. 
---
You can indeed clearly see the damage take off exponentionally in the start of that SBQ fight before you need to shoot the mirelurk hunter.
---
Curse that green 'item cannot be placed' message. I spend so much time wrestling the CAMP interface.
---
Yeah, the in-game descriptions definitely seem to use the terms Durability and Condition interchangeably in some instances. But in the program code, Durability is the size of the bar, and Condition is how full the bar is. I blame Todd for this confusion. Cheers!
---
i don't need stealth to one shot things as a junkie. I try not to of course when playing with others because that is a dick move.. but sometimes even when trying not to it happens. Just today in riding shotgun i managed to one shot two 3\* blood eagles even when just shooting at the ground near them. 
---
but i am all for nerfing the shit out of bloodied and junkies. or to prevent the crying of many people buff the absolute shit out of enemies and other builds.
---
They stopped them dropping, as people farmed them
---
A 1 star legendary scorch beast had her health go back up 4 times on Xbox. So yeah something is fudged up today
---
Like legendary bots in Watoga...that was fun :-)
---
You, and other people that keep complaining about this are not understanding the simple fact that you can oneshot enemies from stealth even with an non-legendary weapon. Bloodied / Junkies or any other prefix have nothing to do with it.
---
Yes I have a bloodied limb damage one I believe
---
oh look it's a legendary [grenade explodes] oh look the corpse went UNDERGROUND &gt;:(
---
Personal terminal, I like it! Or I would...
---
They started out as military then turned into a sudo-military cult. It works for this game because it’s set 25 years after the bombs dropped and it’s kinda interesting on what we get told.
---
It was just a thought.  The server I was on last night there were only 3 or 4 ppl selling ammo on the server and one of them was selling just .38 and 10mm. 
---
I agree with everybody that it would normally be hard to pull off.  Especially if you or someone like you were on the same server.  Selling amm0 has been the best way for me to stay full of caps.  I had to run to the WS bunker and buy another X01 plan because I was just about max caps again.
---
damage resistance of enemies
---
Yeah but I can't suggest a direct nerf since I lose to much karma, mind you this thread is already negative.
---
I mean I can one shot with vats crit pistol build but I just have to not hit space bar and I don't one shot.
---
Ps. Hahaha the downvotes
---
Yeah that makes sense but at the same time it’s not like people aren’t farming them anyway. Instead it’s just tedious af. Killing a sentry boy can at least be fun, but less so when I’m losing ammo and condition on my weapons and armor for nothing.
---
Who knows. Don’t cheat so bad next time.
---
Aim for where they are going to be Jerry...  and one last thing STAY AWAY FROM THE ORACLE FIRE!
---
So that means that only way to do damage is to have an anti armor effect?
---
Back your stuff off to mules, just in case
---
&gt; and new gear around there old base sites.
---
None of those things are available to players. 
---
Also the Enclave was a shadow organization, the concept of having cosmetics outside of most of the normal looking stuff kind of doesn't make sense in the timeline. They are way more about secret handshakes at this point than a uniformed look. You can throw a business suit on and call yourself an enclave official and it makes perfect sense.
---
Damn.   I encountered my very first one last week.  I am level 267, but was all alone,  and it took me almost an hour and something like 10,000 5mm rounds (plus a fair number of respawns and a LOT of jockeying to ensure  he kept getting stuck up against the trees) to take him down.   Not my finest hour,  but at least I can say I've done it.
---
I need to stop saying kill when referring to robots lol
---
exactly what i'm doing right now, thanks
---
Hahah I use grenade launcher and this does happen but the corpse will always disappear and spawn a meat pile so you just have to wait.
---
The enemies DR and the distance you're shooting at also factor in. Try shooting a mole rat point blank and see what damage you get
---
Assuming you want to keep using shotguns, I could recommend some builds but first you want to decide if you want to run bloodied (high dmg but somewhat risky) or junkies (tanky but less dmg than bloodied) or perhaps a more cheap build (furious/AA) weaps.
---
ah awesome, thanks so much!
---
Lore was lost long time ago. Even Beth knows that trying to make something out of it is almost impossible. 
---
MMO are generally bad at weapon/armor lore. You must have a new gear in new dlc/parts etc. So its like this famous wow example when after vanilla people had full geared up badasses with end game gear etc. Than with burning crusades you killed few boars in new land and bam you have better gear.
---
I think I have done this on Xbox. Not recently but I do remember the dialog coming up asking me if i was sure because I would hit 1000 and lose out on it.
---
What’s the condition of your weapon and what perks are you rocking? I think DR and shot placement make a huge difference.
---
I got my bloodied 50 in a drop at West Tek.
---
7th times the charm, right?
---
I got a bloodied .50 cal from sbq. It was only 2* though.
---
Lvl 130, bloody build with a ultracite LMG. He was melting.
---
Yeah the other 2 are probably the best 🤷‍♂️. Depending on your build I’d rock
---
That for awhile. If nocturnal didn’t go negative during daytime it would be fine.
---
I was wrong, I guess 8 is the magic number
---
Damn, just my poor luck 😭. Only played it for 340 hours
---
How do u do it?
---
That is what happened to the people that got the final warning email:  a time out and a warning.
---
I don’t get what you mean with the condition of my weapon. But im using the gunslinger perks and the modern renegade and some other side perks but those are the main
---
Don't forget the Future-Tech camp device breaking fast travel, map icon, vendors and etc. That would have been an ultra easy thing to test and notice immediatly from the sound of it.
---
I do feel they need to be nerfed A bit as they are just so much better than other legendary effects.
---
This happened on my first time through, logged out, logged back in, fixed it.
---
Still blows my mind that people cry about other people’s damage in a coop game.
---
Yes I know but the email claims my characters have been permanently deleted, yet I have access to them still
---
Ill try that yea. But the 33 damage was on a scorched lvl 60 and it was point blank
---
Yeh I have no interest in pvp.
---
I like strength based builds cause 2h, unarmed, and heavy guns all interest me. So the ability to switch between is nice.
---
How do you find out which rolls are bugged?
---
Can you turn in you unwanted version for script?  I know you can’t trade/sell them.
---
I think the daily scrip limit is at least partially there to stop dupers infinitely rolling new legendaries from the purveyor
---
What is this and where can I see it?
---
I think (could be totally off base) if your weapon is low condition it won’t do as much damage. I would try your weapon on different enemies. My laser mini gun would melt flesh enemies but against robots it would chug. Game isn’t super clear on what’s good against what.
---
Licensing fees for popular songs can reach the tens of thousands of dollars. They will even ask for a cut of the revenue from the product it is being licensed to. 
---
So no, we will not be getting any new songs unless they spend thousands and thousands of dollars for about $60 of returns.
---
If you use tank killer you'll get a anti armor effect for every weapon. AA has diminishing returns, so tank killer with a normal weapon can be better. 189 is a fairly low amount of damage, but you should have high DPS. Bloodied mess will give you a 15% damage buff across the board as well
---
Yeah that is true especially in the low level missions but not some events.
---
No one should be one shotting the bosses for free range or encrypted. Even event radiation rumble has legendary sharing issues due to one shotting from stealth.
---
Another tip for the level up challange in both nw and normal is make a new toon. Leave the vault and level up to 3. Takes 5 minutes. Nw. Survive with that toon until the second circle. Leveled up. Then delete the toon. And make a new one for the next day. You’re welcome
---
Junkies I'm really not a fan of either.
---
So is there no way to coordinate vanguard with perk cards?
---
There Brotherhood uniforms around there bases like Thunder Mountain Power Plant or Appalachia Antiques. You can get a crap ton of paint jobs for t60 from Camp Venture. Can more stuff be added? Of course. However, im just saying that the enclave got the short end of the stick and will for the forseeable future. Plus, the overall purpose of this post wasnt who as the most content in 76, but that it just gets tiring that the Brotherhood gets shoehorned into everything and that the end of this season and the next two will be all about them.
---
That is what I do. It was just a thought because the server I was on didn’t really have anybody selling on it besides me.  I sold 6-7k worth of amm0 last night and the rest of it went this am.
---
I finally fought one this week, thanks to the public teams. I saw one of my teammates doing the scared emote, recognized it was from the wendigo, and me and one other went to help him. I went through almost 2K 2mm EC’s during the fight....yeah, the event’s gonna be wild when it drops.
---
I had one die from another player and crash land right in the middle of my camp.
---
Happened for the first time to me just now. Home from work, loaded up, gave me some sort of loading error, got on finally and all the daily ones auto complete. :|
---
If i may ask, what currently would be the best primary legendary for a 50 cal??
---
We're machines, just biomechanical in nature...
---
Yep, standard trade-in value for scrip at the legendary machines.  I've been having to bank extra weapons in storage or on my person as I'm hitting the daily scrip value too frequently now.
---
Under what special is tank killer?
---
Well when exp can be stolen by a guy who one shots anything as they spawn I will.
---
I am sometimes guilty of this due to using a grenade launcher but I don't use bloodied or junkies version so no legendary stealing from me.
---
Yup. Especially when there is no competition over dps in this game. And player A doing more damage than player B does not affect player B in any way. Like i wrote on my comment in this post, oneshotting (the main complain people seem to have) has nothing to do with weapon prefixes.
---
EDIT: Any sort of nerf does not change or fix the issues of oneshotting and bad design in event loot sharing.
---
It's the worst when you're at an event and you try to get others to get some shots of on a legendary enemy and like clockwork some A-hole with like a tse laser rifle comes in and turns a mole miner into a bloody mess.
---
Cool. I currently use batteries included for all the fusion and plasma cores I carry for the queen flight.
---
I have gone with a Vampire's Heavy PA build. Have really enjoyed it.
---
I drop nukes daily. And that is the only one.
---
The gauss shotgun is a strong independent woman and does what it wants.
---
Been using it for about 500 hours now and it's wackiness still surprises me. I have one shot many things in this game with it. But can take 3 shots to kill a level 30 ant.
---
Are you using gun fu? 1 rank helps a LOT
---
8 player limit on that event, just FYI
---
2nd, and sorry accidently posted 7 times though.
---
I used to get attacked every day for a year.. I moved my camp. I haven't been attacked one time since relocated.
---
Just a protip: get the tri barrel. Best DPS that it can push out is with that.
---
Absolutely. Nobody should. But the problem is not weapon prefixes but player behavior and very bad design on loot sharing on events. Asking for nerfs / possible nerfs, and complaining about prefixes do not fix these issues.
---
Depends on your build. Usually for .50 cals the demand goes in this order:  Bloodied/ junkies/ AA then TS/ Furious/ Vamp are all in the same general ballpark based on preference. I may be forgetting something but that’s a decent guide.
---
Don't worry pal, it'just things. Now you know where to find It again and also that this game is constanly bugging and you must be very careful stashing your stuff al the time
---
Yeah they could go with faction similar with the bos. It could be that some military unit nearby responed to maxson who told them that something wrong is happening in WV and they should investigate if they dont want to die as well etc. Not that once again bos is sending expeditions across continent for some shady reason... 
---
Hell we ever get fallout outside of US (Europe/China) im sure bos will be included somehow even if the setting will be 1 year after the great war. Doesnt matter they will be there. 
---
Im writing this as big fan of bos (west Coast and outcasts specifically)  but just tired of Beth sticking them everywhere.
---
I wish they'd bring back some of the music from Fallout 4
---
Im 104 with x01 armour and a 2shote50cal and about 300 stim packs lol
---
iirc it works with whatever grenade you have equipped.   I know it works with strike beacons, so it likely works with artillery
---
Is it me, or when she sings “he kicks the bucket”, The way she sings buck buck bucket does NOT sound like that but “something else”. I’ve caught myself sing the “something else” almost every time I hear that song. 🤣🤣
---
Adrenaline isn't functioning, btw.
---
Plus you can one shot things on the horizon with 2% VATS hit chance :-)
---
I obviously wouldn't have any proof of this but one possibility is duping and another is a legendary farming glitch. Or maybe they're just pretty damn lucky.
---
I would buy it
---
level 300+ isn't a thing for casual gamers, if you're at your "endgame" at lvl 70 then that's how it is, you're done time to move on.
---
Perception and bloody mess is luck
---
There’s no way it’s lucky they have over 100 guns of bloodied and then bloodied explosive. Level 551. Like whatever if they get to do it fuck it I guess.
---
My game crashes usually at least a few times a week...sometimes as much as 1-3 times a night while playing. It's been that way for a long time for me though.
---
It’s always funny when neither of you have picked anything up yet, so it just ends up being a fist fight out in the open.
---
Just don't get caught.
---
They load you facing away from destination to allow time to
---
load assets, doesnt really work.
---
You have to re-equip them every time you switch weaps or go into/outta PA btw
---
Wonder if we get more than 1-2 daily quests to grind new currency.
---
Fucking dope!!! I can have pvp fight near my base and have arty nades on me lol. Give em a Schock of their lives
---
Yea I know I was just throwing it out there lol
---
Why not add in every song (that they still have the rights to) from every game?
---
I gOt SpUrS tHaT JiNgLe JaNgLe JiNgLe
---
Duh. Do it on a private server like an adult.
---
Tank killer is only for rifles
---
I've done the Encryptid event like 15-20 times and not once has the Fixer plan dropped. Then two nights ago I run to a random player vendor to buy some ammo to complete the challenge and dude has the fixer plan for 2k caps.
---
I gasped like a little girl and bought that sucker as fast as I could.
---
Wish I could do this, my slots are all full
---
So here's what I do to be able to change between heavy guns and unarmed. Strength is 15. I keep traveling pharmacy for both. Then I just swap out the weapon perks. Intelligence is level 9. For intelligence I keep nerd rage for both. Then I put on power user lvl 3 (I use ultracite gatling lazer bc of easy ammo availability) and then stabilized lvl 3. Then for agility I keep it at lvl 9. I throw on Thru-hiker instead of Ninja (I rely heavily on my grocers backpack). Then in Luck I have it at lvl 11. I take off serendipity and put on One-Gun Army. I do 2000+ damage with my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with perks for that and I do 175 with my bloodied gatling lazer with perks for that.
---
I wanted to take a pic but they backed out and threw a thumbs down that they would trade
---
That's a great point!  Relative noob-ness.
---
2%? 0% AMIRITE!1!
---
6k? I found one for 5k and he had multiple.  
---
Being on PS4 really sucks here.
---
I mean by Bethesda.  If you dupe, but in small enough amounts, they don't know/can't find out/don't care.
---
I still have a full set of unyielding armor form when I tried a bloodied build.  It was crazy powerful but died a lot and went back to a regular build.  I have been on the lookout to try a junkies build. I got a 1 /* junkies gat that I’m going to try out tonight. Need to get start getting addicted and see how it goes.
---
I just saw it on this website that calculates the price for a certain item
---
I think you’re the only person in the game using a grenade launcher. But it’s more the build than the weapon. I can rinse the sheepy and SB with a normal fixer. The bloodied just makes it a little faster. And I can one shot everything else with ease. To nerf the damage they’d have to rework all the damage and stealth perks. Which is never happening.
---
Ugh, I have a portable toilet blueprint with an open sign in it and frogs on the walls inside and I always wave when people open the door but not once have they let me live.
---
Yeah I have floated the idea of making all damage buffs around 30% for legendary weapons.
---
The other idea I like is turning adrenal mutation and nerd rage into a temporary buff that is triggered for let's say 20 seconds at 20% health.
---
Yeah, Im a fairly new player and the more I dig into the crashing/freezing topic the more im starting to realize its a common issue... suxs
---
But I like the Savage Divide  it has the best scenic overlooks and personal water sources in the entire map. Uhh I usually draw out their attention before they attack my camp but it decided to crop dust it and fly away like a cheeky cunt. It was a legendary too so I regained all its health when I dropped it at 10% but had to reload
---
I remember this being “fixed” a short while ago. The very next day I found Ward hanging out on some boulders outside the walls.
---
Even easier is to go to a hostile location that has a vendor, kill everything, loot the weapons and sell them to the nearby vendor. Server hop and repeat.
---
The Morgantown Airport and Camden Park both work well for lower level characters. Harpers Ferry for higher levels.
---
Can literally take the entire 1400 daily cap supply in like 10 minutes.
---
Yep, mine also auto triggers crits quite frequently, I did that 50 crit challenge in about 10 mins.
---
Much appreciated, thanks!
---
Oh I have a junkies ld mini. Wondering if I should give it a spin.
---
Body shot? Yeah I was just saying shooting a low level animal like a mole rat would have very little DR, so you could see what damage you do. If you get less on high level enemies and do less damage, that pretty much just boils down to their increased DR. I do 1.5k damage on most enemies, but i get like 180 on a head shot on the SBQ because she has a lot more armor
---
see, I dont ever die and I'm bloodied, you need to make sure you have the right perks. blocker, ironclad, serendipity, fireproof a few others. also armor plated backpack. I have insane resistances and the main thing that kills me is myself lol
---
It's great for splash damage in events. I run with pacifist on and usually just shoot the one wade in and bash melee character and get splash on everything.
---
Yep.  Tri barrel and capacitor, not dynamo unless you want to go prime.  I have the skin and it looks sick btw, op.
---
Yes that’s what made three dog Mr new vegas and even Travis so interesting.
---
Yea gotta love when people have more op weapons than they'll ever use and display them just to shove it in your face lol
---
Yeah very true, I hope one wastelander will fix some of these issues.
---
I dont think people intend to one shot a legendary but they just do due to high damage.
---
Mine were two. I just cleared one off and re started it. Easy enough to do and the time saves on the level up as someone who doesn’t get a huge amount of time to play is a god send.
---
Names are outstanding
---
Interesting take. Healing factor is a favorite of mine, especially with rank 3 class freak. You lose ~10% potency on chems, but you never need stimpacks.
---
Well how far should they go, do we share exp and loot from enemies too.
---
I don't really want legendaries most of the time, I want the kill for a daily or the exp for the legendary track.
---
NO
---
Licensing, it's all about licensing.
---
Agreed. Thats my point in a nutshell. I love BoS, but at this point being a Knight for them is checking off a box on a checklist then feeling special, and they are all over the place for a dying order
---
Camden park also has can chimes you'll get 70is lead and 140ish steel every time.
---
Yep. I usually go to higher health and ping on shortly to tag but it depends on the situation. At uranium the last couple of times I’ve had kevel 50-80 players steal the first legendary. For me that’s an open invitation to kill everything in one shot with gun fu.
---
I have limited time during the day to play and getting 3 legendary kills when people on shot them during an event is impossible. 
---
I only play and hour a day.
---
Are the red asylum uniforms rare? I gave one I found to a friend for his collection just last week.
---
Damn I totally missed that.
---
Its an issue because it takes you days to offload. Like literally days if you're just trying to RR. You can save off to max scrip but you can't "spend" it all on one sitting. So hitting the cap really works against you.
---
I just want country roads by John Denver to be added
---
Did they try to take away his Bryce Jayhart books?
---
Also, Science scribe and medical goggles, I like your style.
---
It says it’s not bugged but who knows
---
Games been out for almost two years ? It's not unfeasible they do *alot* of trading and bartering..
---
Thanks mate
---
I came across a scorchbeast head just casually rolling down a hill once, rolled right passed me....
---
I finally got my first unyielding SS armor after 40 tries. It was a 3 Star. I actually removed all my rads to not be bloodied in hopes the rng would give me what it appeared like I would not want and sure enough it did or maybe just dumb luck who knows.
---
I’m a new player and it was my first server glitch haha. I thought fast traveling would fix it, but I was wrong.
---
Sorry.  There are similar cards for other damage types.
---
Yeah it’s whatever I played game since launch but dropped all those guns back in the day. If they can get away with it fuck it
---
Same for me, it probably isn’t any different but it has this clean fresh feel to it
---
my Pump-Action Shotgun does this, almost always at 3 rounds in the chamber it starts to reload
---
A lot came back on 23rd though.
---
Reasonably. Nowhere near what they were. Like the croc plan and b2525 fixers and legacy’s prices have plummeted and for the plans will continue. The res asylum still goes for 30-50k and if someone’s desprate a little more. Consider before the dupe it was worth a million or more same with the b2525 fixer and exploding bloodied plasma gats
---
That was the insider feeding all the info to the Raiders and Blood Eagles. Maybe now we can get a new daily quest.
---
Can i ask what weapon you are using?
---
Steam shows currently live players etc
---
Whats a good price to put them at
---
It's not too bad most nights, better than it used to be before last update...well for me at least. I find that there are a few things that will really mess you up - for example, just last week I clicked to fast travel to someone's camp to have a look at their vendors, they logged off while I was in transit and not only did it crash the game, it crashed my xbox. Completely shut it off and forced a restart. That's a pretty bad crash.
---
Yeah I’ve played since game came out and took a couple month break problem is I dropped all the guns back then because I didn’t know it would be legacy. Idk if I had a picture I would show you. I don’t care if they do a lot of trade no way no freaking way they have all those guns period
---
I wanna see some Elvis 😁
---
Take solace in knowing that they will never be able to fast travel. 🤷‍♂️
---
Ahh, okay, makes sense!
---
That was a great weekend. I finished this week as well.
---
You have inspired me to give my guns good ol' spanish names like "Furia del Hidalgo"
---
I recommend farming fissure sites. The scorchbeasts there spawn very regulary as legendary and the re-spawn is about 10minutes. I usually get all 3 legendary kills by just going through all fissure sites on one or two servers.
---
No even better is when your bush wookien and people just run straight by always gives me a good laugh
---
Yeah what’re they going to do, fix the bugs?
---
I just started thanks to the game pass, its super fun imo
---
Why? Unbanned?
---
BE15r full auto handmade with sneak, headshots, bloody mess, tank killer, nerd rage, commando perks, adernal reaction mutation as well as some other stuff
---
I play on xbox...30-50K...caps? Yeesh, that's way out of my economy scale. I guess I should check before giving the rare stuff I come across to my friends LOL
---
What else would you put in there?  That’s all I ever fill it with myself
---
Sounds like something a synth would say...
---
Nor gunsmith on Gauss shottys, I need to repair mine at least once per session, even at 200% repair
---
It is quite fun once you get past the bugs. Level 357 and still going. Hit me up at gt Omnytrix if you need help
---
Idk first time it’s ever happened to me lol
---
I think it auto drinks tho....
---
Yes, and kept all stuff
---
I used to do this till I ran out of nukashine
---
PC or console?
---
Honestly that's not that out there. If he was lvl 100 something then yea that's fishy but a 500+ will have done A LOT of bartering and grinding, so by now they should have something to show for all that work. Definitely possible they cheated, but not out of the world that they got there legit.
---
I've seen people with full sets radium, handmade, ECT weapons displayed
---
Yeah nice idea, scorchbeasts do tend to spawn legendary but I issue I have is they tend to fly off and I don't have any good anti air weapons using a crit pistol build. 
---
 I normally do white springs but I normally only get one there.
---
Exactly.  They came for a free drink and ended up with a free trip
---
That's what happens when someone says, "Enough is enough! Get the fucking scanner yourself, ya dick!..and pick up a damn hammer aleady!"
---
Ahh oke so super high damage, I hope i can crank up my damage since a revolver should do quite a bit of damage. I also have a two shot explosive lever action but i don’t think a can make a build for that while i have the revolver build
---
I'm quoting Picard from TNG actually :-)
---
Christmas event was way better. It was actually nice to get the new plans and caps and scrip. But with the mole miner event, the presents had been d*ped so much and plans had been laying around in paper bags that a lot of people already got most of the plans, so it sucked that the mole miner pales were mostly repeat plans and no scrip
---
i.e.  They will kick the can down the road and do nothing about it.  Par for the course...
---
Lol. How stupid. Seriously.
---
I’ve been wanting to do nukashine bingo with freinds and go on one hell of a bednee
---
Congrats dude are you feeling a little sad you dont have anything to do again like me.
---
The helmets? SS, vault 94...?
---
In the episode "The Measure of a man"
---
The worst feeling is when u vats shoot before you realize it’s a legendary... makes me feel like a crumb person every time
---
Both I believe.
---
A bit. I'm redoing some camps now with my new stuffs
---
That sounds like a great activity.  Everyone starts at 76 and drinks a nukashine each, then have to walk back or make it a race
---
I got into a fight with a 3\* legendary SB in the bog a week or so back...got it down, it regenerated then took it back to about 25% again and it turned and flew south past Watoga. I chased after it but it just kept on going off into the distance never to be seen again.
---
It would not be a bad idea, but it would encourage "leeching" more. That's why they changed Queens looting system early on when the game was new. Originally people would just shoot her once, and run to the bunker to hide away and wait until others kill her.
---
If i was a designer at bughesda, i would change how the legendary enemies mutate. When mutation happens at 50% health, i would put a 5-10 second (or even more) damage immunity or very very high damage resistance on them. That would give time for people to tag them. EDIT: And also force the mutation to happen, even if the damage dealt would be enough to one shot.
---
I mean only server. On pc I know you can with steam. 
---
On server just go to recents and it’s everyone in the server
---
I want to find the radio station , and see the host
---
It might be asking a little much but I wouldn't mind the trio, Big bad John, Cajun Queen, and little bitty Big John. I like little bitty big John better the the regular big John.
---
Haha or get a bingo of locations. I’d have to do research
---
All I can say is that’s your personal experience man, maybe it’s something in the way you interact with people, I don’t think it’s harmful to have a positive attitude about things
---
 In my opinion, Zealot's Minigun is a good early choice for Scorched Beast.  Should be super cheap because they are not considered to be good overall, which is true.  However, if you need to take down a Scorched Beast, it will get the job done. From there you can shop for better guns as you go.    
---
Angry Turtle on YouTube has a full health heavy gunner build video.  I am using that build right now and loving it.
---
A crippling completionist addiction.
---
Right now my goal is to get the recipe of every serum. Then it'll be to finish up the scout challenges I couldn't be bothered with. Also, the ongoing legendary run. Then who knows.
---
I have a problem and Bethesda is an enabler.
---
How does one even have enough capacity in the stash box to hold all these weapons?
---
This fixed my camp too! Thank you
---
That’s how I found out I accidentally made my camp on top of a nukashine spot.  I just thought it had a random chance of bringing you back to your camp as if you stumbled your way home
---
Yea now that I'm allied with crater I want to re do my camp as a raider style kinda dirty camp. But right now i really like my clean little town camp right outside the wayward for all the new game pass guys on xbox
---
Good chance you end up in the mire :-)
---
Lol I did it too. I’m next to the giant windmill in the toxic valley
---
Dailies
---
A legacy weapon is a weapon that no longer drops in game, like energy weapons with the explosive effect. A magic weapon has to do with current broken prefixes attached to certain weapon types. I suck at explaining things but Angry Turtle on YouTube does a great showcase.

Challenge, buy 3 things from a player, 250 points
---
When the daily (which seems like a permanent daily all of a sudden) needs to be done I visit a camp with ammo.  Buy a single bullet 2 times and then for the last purchase grab 100 to 200........if it's 1 cap a round.  If it's priced more than that I buy 3 total and that's it because most ammo is barely worth 1 cap to begin with.
---
I dont sell ammo anymore but when I did fusion cores at 100 percent charge were 14 caps and plasma cores 7, and they would still sit in the machine for days on end before someone bought them.
---
Its because of the daily S.C.O.R.E. challenge that requires players to either buy/sell 3 items from other players.
---
https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/
---
Numbers are consistently bouncing 20-35k before, during and after the banwave. I think many people have exaggerated the effect.
---
Bush wookie?
---
They ARE pretty lazy, my daily on the weekend to find a bone saw gave me a lot of problems when the circle was centered on their base. Turned out the thief was walking along the road on the east under the cliff wall. I walked up to the edge of the base and shot him then went down and collected it.
---
"I can give you the general location but you'll have to find it"
---
"...ummmm, it's right there...I can see the thief from here...I mean I could hit him with a rock...did you even look for your stupid bonesaw?"
---
We have been having a score daily “Buy or Sell to another player 0/3“ each 1 round counts towards the daily
---
Youre screaming into the void.
---
This was on the player and what’s funny is he can still run I’m pretty sure all the weapons every single one was 90% reduced weight
---
I bought 3x .308 and then left it in bag in front of machine
---
Nice.  I’m at that little lake next to Middle Mountain Cabins
---
It's not even been out for 2 years...
---
Yea I turned the radio off about 1.5 years back. They do need some "new " stuff
---
One animal has extremely low chance of getting bear arm, but you need three for the puncturing and heavy mods.
---
Hmm, it's also not ideal since I have people kill legendaries during the mutates health regen meaning my initial damage damage was nothing compared the the damage needed to kill a legendary during a mutate.
---
That means no legendary for me even if I tagged it.
---
I've been wondering why is that?
---
Well don’t I feel silly for leaving the world so fast. Thanks so much for the info!
---
S.C.O.R.E. !
---
That’s messed up lol
---
I may move soon because
---
*squeeeek* 
---
*creaaaaaaaaaaak*
---
Weapon weight reduction armor likely. You can stack it to 90 pct. Multiple perks reduce weight too
---
Dude, has so much regret in his speech
---
That was 100% me that gave you that stuff. Once a play session I find a lower level character and craft them stuff based on what it “looks like” they are running. I had somebody do it for me quite a while ago and now I do it for other people. The frustrating thing is when I craft stuff and drop it and people run off 😂
---
I'm going to tweak my theater camp by riverside first, then my main's at the cemetery on hopewell
---
Read the daily challenges, you'll see why
---
I have found doing a hard reset on the xbox helps with crashes, especially after each update
---
Thanks for the info 🙏🏼
---
I wish we could have a radio Appalachia quest line.
---
Where’s the windmill again?
---
Yeah you’ll be alright then, can always use the photo mode glitch to speed it up too
---
It's pretty much why I never use it.
---
They should show in your stash. 
---
If you look in your stash under weapons you should see them there and be able to pick them up from there...they'll have a tag that indicates they're mounted on the wall.
---
Trickle down quotes
---
Is there any others? or is it just bloodied and junkies.
---
That one, and falling from a cliff to a middle high ledge, are two of the only ways to loose your junk in this game. Very easy to avoid tho
---
I’d argue that a Thorn set is much better for a stealth build, especially now that shadowed mods have been fixed.
---
SO LEAVE IT IN THERE IT AIN'T HURTIN NOBODY
---
I have a theory ward is selling foundation property for 120 caps and getting us to track it down for 60, 60 is his to keep if we donate it he makes full profit and likes us more
---
Waiting to play with my brother, honestly
---
They need to just source it to get it from the community. Make a competition where users submit their bands playing original music that fits from that time period. Make some legal rules so it has to be original pieces not covers, etc.
---
Give winners an exclusive cosmetic and life of 1st and boom. Ez new songs.
---
West side of toxic valley. Has a random encounter spawn too so that’s nice. I’ll see if I can find it
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.

If we’re going to make a wish list how about we add another state like Kentucky that we can go to with all new missions in new places and we can travel back-and-forth between states, if we’re wishing that is

This is fucking with me right now because I KNOW it doesn’t look better, but I constantly feel like it does and I’m glad I’m not alone

even after 1300 hours and knowing what will happen i still click on every single punch bowl i see

FORTUNE FAVOURS THE BRAVE!
---
Pistol builds can be tough for some end game content, but the guass pistol is a viable option.
---
Why haven't they added "Come On Everybody" from the Wastelanders trailer yet????? The song is fire af and doesnt seem to be that popular outside of Fallout
---
The term refers to someone who hides in bushes, buildings or along the edge of the map in a shooter game and doesn't contribute to the team. 
---
In Nuclear Winter xp is gained by surviving, the longer you live the more so you get. There is also xp for kills but avoiding conflict and sticking to the shadows will usually give you at least a top 10 spot. 
---
Hopefully all my fellow bush wookies replying here have the decency to not do it on a team but a lot of folks do. 
---
Me being horrible at pvp, I'm old with bad eyes and bad reflexes and I make stupid decisions, I am all about the bush wookie ways. It's also kind of fun, like a Metal Gear, sneaky, stealth game with human NPC's. Hell, I've even won a handful of matches without ever picking up a gun.
---
Thank you your very help full
---
Can’t find it... up the hill from one of the farms down in a valley, not on a hill, it’s overlooking hemlock holed
---
Tell me about it, I romance by Collectron up real nice, greased his nipple nuts and everything, he was hot to trot.
---
Logged off for dinner and when I came back...nothing but toilet paper talk...
---
Granted, armor now gives 0 scrip
---
Lool you gotta take risk
---
I think I started to feel like I was actually good at the game the first time I soloed Dead in the Water on Standard difficulty.  It gave me the confidence to solo SBQ and Encryptid later on, which were actually much easier.
---
A team of 5 is easy mode. One person can do venison, 2 on sludge, and 2 on kelp. Kelp respawns best when you kill all the spawned creatures quickly and it's a large area to cover.  Friendly fire for each animal and call out when the alpha shows up. Have someone able to kill it quick and try not to worry about tagging the alpha at all if it can be killed fast. Worst case you get a grafton that one- shots your animal. It's still possible to lose a beast. Also public servers tend to be better for completion than private due to better radstag and kelp/creature spawns. If you get a good team together you can spend evenings hopping for it and then all join in. It's a great and fun event if you can coordinate like that.
---
If I was on ur server I would have joined in on the queen
---
Nice, maybe I’ll do some exploring tonight while trying to get all the daily’s done
---
My dailies and weeklies auto completed when I logged in. 😂
---
Oh and don't forget to clear out the robots prior to kicking off the experiment. And watch for respawning robots when new folks join the event.
---
Well, plague Walker does damage to enemies around you when you are diseased. No brainer. Of course it will put you in caution.
---
Had a legendary spawn inside my house.  Damaged my entire camp.  Boy did I murder that thing.
---
Like a flamer that shoots explosive bullets...cus ya know that totally makes sense.
---
Sad to hear that. If  you are on EU maybe try a bit earlier on the day if you are able to. There are always a lot of people then to do it.
---
Hope you have more luck with her next time
---
There is NO way that is accurate.  Hit the update player count button.
---
And keep hitting it.  It's BS.
---
haha.
---
And the ban wave did have an impact, why do you think they changed course and unbanned so many.  By perm banning people they are decreasing their chance of revenue.  The rate they are going free to play will be coming at some point.  Gamepass was the last effort to inject players.
---
***laughs in f04***
---
Ah! Interesting. I usually lurk in the cabins on the Morgantown map until the storm forces me to flee. I suck at spotting other players, so I die very quickly if I’m forced into combat. So I suppose I’m a bit of a bush wookie.
---
It’s meeee I’m that guy. Lmao
---
Any chance for 2 surviving animals? Lol
---
Pleasant valley is better imo. Quick and always mole miners, super mutants, or scorched. Harpers can be ferals, which dont drop much to sell.
---
Keep up the good work lol
---
And lead will sell instantly in player vending machines.
---
Scout armor / Thorn armor is way more durable than SS from my experience but SS is way cheaper to repair
---
I got a bffr 90rw and be 25lvc 50 cals from the purveyor before
---
Hmmm I think potentially 2 animals adds the diffuser plan, but my memory is hazy on that.
---
Be thankful you’re not trying to build an unyielding Thorn set.  One roll per day instead of 3-4.
---
yeah. it doesn't count for you in any way
---
I thought my camp had no place for a big dead tree with a cage but once I got it  I realized I will FIND a place for this tree
---
They drop loads of xp :)
---
Still one of my main sources of caps post level 300.  Make a bunch of small purifiers and then empty them each time you're in camp.
---
I need a better networking. I am still looking for a legacy weapon.     :'-(
---
Im still pretty new im lvl 90 somthing but havent made any steady friends on it. The friendly fire is a perk card?
---
Public servers are a shit show in any game, nothing to do to avoid it, this is why companies offer private servers.
---
When you start an instance, only the host has progress. No one else will have quest progress.
---
Appalachian roulette. I leave my bowl and Nuka machine both filled, every slot except one in each is Nukashine with the one being bourbon.
---
I had a server disconnect while completing the photomode daily on Tuesday. (Nothing was completed at that point.)
---
Logged back in to find 8750 points of daily and weekly challenges autocompleted. And, oddly, 10 of 50 criticals completed for the only weekly that was available to me. 
---
Robbed me of the chicken coop I was hoping to get yesterday.
---
Reminds me of the old joke about an elephant painting it’s toenails pink to hide in a strawberry patch!
---
It was pretty easy to find
---
Enjoy the early game.  The early game was my favorite part.
---
The Wayward location has a nice beginner quest.  Check it out. (You may want to read up on spoilers for that quest because there is a cosmetic item that can be missed).  
---
Do not rush into Savage Divide (unless you want the challenge).  Try Toxic Valley before Savage Divide.  
---
If you like YouTube, Angry Turtle has a lot of very good videos about Fallout 76.
---
It just works
---
Is there anything on the season pass not bugged in some way?
---
What's the best arrow mod.
---
Don't be sorry.
---
Great point...I soloed it (died about 7 times) by simply stealthing to grab all the pylons, firing at the sheep/using stimpacks, die. Rinse/repeat. The robots were wandering around minding their business the entire time. One other person would have been perfect.
---
Sounds good.  Maybe I’ll have a nukashine and get lucky
---
That's great, thanks for sharing
---
How's your day?
---
It's like a minigame
---
Thanks I'll go check him out
---
I dont even need new music, bring back songs from Fallout 3, Fallout NV, and Fallout 4. Like some Bob Crosby tunes
---
MGS 4
---
Just my 2c, nearly all builds can one-shot all but the SBQ.
---
Maybe he had armor but every single gun that I was able to see where 90% weight reduction so he had all the regular ones and explosive one and all 90 weight reduction. So all he goodies in one spot
---
ENCLAVE FOR LIFE
---
They should add it around the world like the magazines and bobbleheads... I know the lyrics of  about 80% of songs. Butcher pete, uranium, Mr 5x5, atom Bomb baby, we three, mr. Sandman, country road, etc.... even rose radio. Man I know that radio so well. It's story time with roooose. I can crush a human spine with a single claw.......😅😅
---
After watching What We Do In The Shadows, I feel like [Tony Allen - Nite owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOm4hSPLJd4) should be added to the list of new songs to be added. Feels like it could be in the Fallout universe.
---
3* SBs can’t spawnv
---
Yeah, I was going to say HF is underrated. It was my most recent pickup and I must say, the healing is nuts for our bloodied builds.
---
Sometimes I'm that guy. Like I'm not sure if the person is part of a team. Or 1 time I couldn't fit in the bush because someone else was there and I panicked
---
I prefer to solo. So much easier.
---
Sweet, yours?
---
On like xbox I usually do a soft gaming background check if basically if they are new to the game (like almost no achievements) or if they are a older player if they are truly a new player I drop them stuff
---
AMERICA NOW AND FOREVER! JOHN HENRY EDEN 2277!
---
And then Bethesda will announce and implement it, but it won’t work properly for 9 months.
---
I wonder why there is a limit in how much you can scrip in a day, rather than how much you can SPEND in a day?
---
These are complex items with condition bars, weapon stats, resistances, legendary effects and other variables to keep track of. Surely being able to reduce all that to a single number (your scrip) is better for game performance?
---
Bethesda can keep their daily limit, keep the legendary economy intact and maybe improve server performance?
---
The bushes are great, especially with the ghillie suit. You can absolutely vanish with that thing on.
---
Kinda meh struggling to get rp in a apex legends league group
---
Sorry for late reply. Yes I’m on PC. Hollowbound is my ign
---
I use a non Power Armor Heavy Weapons Full Health Vanguard Build. 
---
This is what I'm currently using:

---
To answer your question about synergy perk cards there's not much to be honest but here are my suggestions: 
---
- Grab Rejuvenated and Life Giver to boost your HP
---
- Grab Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, and Tenderizer to Boost Damage
---
- Grab Blocker and Fireproof for Defense
---
- In the future consider grabbing Funky Duds and Sizzling Style Legendary Perks to further increase Defense
---
I wouldn't know. I run heavy guns on one character and commando on another and love shooting things. I never have enough to sell lol.
---
I don't think having a positive attitude is harmful at all. I do think luring people into a false sense of safety in the same community that involves trap camps, griefers, and people who insta-kill event bosses and legendaries for the lulz is a little iffy though.  
---
 " maybe it’s something in the way you interact with people "   
---
You just have to be logged on, and interacting with people in 76 at all, and by interacting I mean being around them.  Do enough events and you'll see it.
---
The people coding the game don't play it, and the people making the Atom shop stuff don't either.  
---
They don't QA anything because that would mean more money spent.  
---
You are the QA, and they'll decide if they'll bother fixing anything.
---
Jet is mentioned game, however jet did exsist before the war as well probably under a different name so it can potentially exist in 76 at the same time as well.
---
Yes, both passionate and incapable.  Too bad that combination won't pay the bills...
---
And all the generic npc too. Like blue ridge workers making settlement dialog
---
I have to agree with you. There have been NO high levels since the wave. Highest I’ve seen is 120.
---
They stack y’know, looks kinda like a LEGO fridge
---
I use a 1 star bloodied.  It gets the job done, you can get 1k on her in 10 seconds in the air.  She can be killed faster than that but you don't see it much.  Ammo for it is basically free as you get so many shots per craft.
---
SMs are lore braking, but they will Retcon for the sake of gameplay, I dont mind.
---
Dude, I though this was just me. Happned to me the other day for the first time and it was so funny. I didn't realize it at first but the guy was afk. I have issue with afk (it's my hangup, no disrespect) so i slowly shot him as to not give away our perfect bush. His orange death bag was sticking half out of the bush, so when another player came to loot it I got another easy kill. It was one of the more memorable games I've had on nuclear winter.
---
I didn’t mean to offend man, I see where you’re coming from I guess, I suppose I’m one of these people who’s a die hard glass half full kind of guy
---
I got an additional question. Why cant we trade for scrip or charge scrip for legendaries in our shop?
---
Maybe a 2* then...I was sure it was 3, but then again I have a terrible time trying to see the stars on them when they're flying about...either way - it was a legendary and flew off over watoga into the distance...was really pissed.
---
&gt; There Brotherhood uniforms
---
Like what? The engineers outfit? All the stuff you are listing off is from fallout 4 and is actually out of place given the timeline. The paint at camp venture doesn't even match the current BoS rank structure.
---
Once you're level 17 get the woodchucker perk for luck (i think). You'll be able to harvest twice the amout of wood
---
Good luck with that my dude.
---
Isn’t that suit something you get from playing lots of NW though?
---
How you doing in fallout?
---
**glares at the ammo converter**
---
Personally I like explosive
---
You can still slap lore on things to make it make some sense at least. Much of the stuff we are seeing added doesn't even get that treatment. 
---
As far as the stats, you can slap better stats on the same old gear and still have the lore make sense. Pristine T-51b! Now with more armor, because it hasn't been rusting out in the wasteland for 25 years!
---
At least there’s always that
---
Because you have kept Wren’s quest unfinished.
---
And besides, once you’ve got Rocksy’s activated, just do the ‘Appalachia has a new corpse’ loop to max out your Raider rep all in one go.
---
For each 50 levels you unlock a slot and pick a card, then sell unused normal perk cards for points to level them up
---
Can you still hear the game sound effects?
---
I randomly put one of three or four different things in it whenever someone takes a drink, and one of those is a nukashine. It's great fun to see where you end up.
---
This absolutely absurd.
---
Brotherhood Fatigues, Brotherhood Jumpsuit, soldier outfit, scribe outfit, and stuff from Camp Venture. Also in theory Ultracite Power armor but only with a skin do you get the symbols on it. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3KEvneETjyc
---
What economy? 
---
There’s maybe 5 people on your instance with vending machines, and of those, likely none will have what you’re looking for.
---
Sure can I received a BE90 from a drop many Moons ago.
---
You have to wait for a while. It happened to me today and It solved itself in like three minutes. Months ago at the end of Scorched Land It took like 7-8 minutes. It's a pain in the ass, but it's better than loosing rewards and the sweet loot
---
I misread that and thought you said all builds can 1 shot SBQ.  
---
I'm just gonna add though that not *all* builds can, just the ones specced for damage (which i assume is what you mean)  
---
Like, a CAMP builder build wont be 1 shotting anything, but bloodied/junkies ect will be 1 shotting most things
---
Could be a diseased 2*
---
It's a game design issue. 
---
I'll preface this by saying that I don't even bother chasing after legendaries during events because it's futile. The problem is that most people have guns that will one shot or almost one shot the legendary. And they know that everyone else also has one of those weapons. So if they take the time to switch to a weaker weapon, they risk missing getting a shot off. 
---
All players in the vicinity should be able to loot the legendary. True, some players may sit around doing nothing and collect the loot but I'd rather reward a player for doing nothing than deprive a player who did all of the work during an event but got no loot because someone killed the legendary at the doorway.
---
I don't think I've seen this observation before, thanks. It makes sense, but not something I had previously thought of.
---
Edit: your edit is very interesting!
---
Refresh, refresh, refresh..and every single time its in the same range and has been relatively constant for a good while. And Steam, PS and Xbox specific numbers show similar settle core player numbers. 
---
People just want the numbers to be wrong to prove the game is dieing just as they have since day 1.
---
Banning did have an impact, i didn't say otherwise. But the Hater community went ape over its effect worth reports of thousands disappearing and empty servers. The argument that Beth unbanned many because they wanted their money (BTW they weren't banned - accounts were 'suspended') is another pathetic attempt to rubbish the company. Far more harm comes from losing new blood and the non-cheating player based by cowing down to the big dupers.
---
The song I've heard the least in my playtime is wouldn't it be nice, and the song I've heard the most is jukebox Saturday night. 
---
Idk if it's just bad timing but that's my experience.
---
Apologies that I've missed it, as I've got 300h in and haven't ran into it once. Psycho, mentats, buffout, and the combinations of them, but never jet. Being it slowed time down, how does it work in F76 then?
---
As for Jet itself, I thought it was invented in F2 in 2240 by Myren?
---
Yeah, but if they were rolled into one, the stash boxes scattered throughout the world would have a use for me.
---
Maybe I’ll give it another try the next time I get a bloody weapon. I was a bloody smashy when I tried it.
---
I’ve yet to see Nia spawn during campfire tales
---
It's buggy as crap.  You basically have to use magic in order to have the lower end of it's performance be worth even using it.
---
I can't even point to anything really helping it.  Sometimes I have Skeet Shooter off and don't even notice, other times I put it back on and it seems dramatically better.
---
It's just the game man.  I can log in one day and charred ghouls will 1-shot me all day or I can log in and be able to walk through a horde of them and barely be scratched.  Buggy as shit.
---
Why does my level 50 two star power dust sell for 7 script?,
---
Oxhorn discussed this in one of his lore videos. He made the conclusion that just because the kid from Fallout 2 discovered it, doesn't mean it couldn't have been discovered elsewhere as well. He didn't actually bring this up, but the concept of "multiple discovery" does exist, and is much more common than you'd think. Here's the wiki for it if your interested.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple\_discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery) 
---
Also, Myron is/was a little punk, and there's always the chance he was lying and got the formula from somewhere else. 
---
When it comes to lore, I think nothing is really set in stone unless you see it for yourself in-game, or Bethesda says it for a matter of fact. Other than that, I think we all have our own version of continuity that plays out in our head, and because it's an rpg, we are all going to see it a bit differently.
---
When you can join scorched earth and do significant damage to the queen
---
WITHOUT USING A "MAGIC" WEAPON.
---
At that point you've pretty much got the game figured out.
---
*BETHESDA'S DESIRE TO CHARGE ME ATOMS FOR MUSIC INTENSIFIES*
---
Are you on xbox? I would trade it for literally any 2 star bloodied fixer.
---
The most prevailant thing I seem to get is bloodied weapons which is shite because im not a bloodied build, maybe not 100 but im also 200 levels lower then this guy and I scrip, give away or sell anything bloodied I get
---
Yes it is. It was worth the grind for me personally because I actually enjoy the mode. I have a lot of fun sneaking and hiding and surviving as long as possible and it's much easier now that I have it.
---
Same story bro, I have just transferred the important stuff somewhere safe :D if shit goes down, I will be dropping them on eBay.
---
Thanks for remember, only one left in the bowl
---
Ah cool. Mine is justinspired but I'm off to bed now as it's past my bedtime here in the UK 😁 Hope we can meet up soon.
---
Same but I’m bloodied I’m level 270. So if you’re on Xbox ill take those weapons from you. What is your build

---
Sorry meant to say its mentioned but not actually in the game. It was a pre war amphetamine made with fertiliser. Myron just remade it with brahmin dung instead I believe.
---
To be quite honest I've been incredibly lucky in that game.  
---
All 4 of my characters have close to the best weapons you can get  
---
for their classes. My time in there is spent hunting low level legendaries to give out to low levels.  
---
I'm doing the legendary run without much enthusiasm. At least it gives me a goal.  
---
I've been playing a lot of Disco Elysium instead, and enjoying that immensely.
---
I saw a video where angry turtle was fighting some Santa scorched and it was hilarious. But I agree I really want more incentive to explore, It’s cool to wander around and see the sites but you hardly run into anything that exciting at the moment.
---
Pssst. Bethesda doesnt care
---
If it's those Stairs with the Pillars, I get that often.  Solution is to scrap the walls attached to them.  I hate when that happens, as well.
---
Oh nice you sound like a good player
---
Those two are the most relevant to the game, you can run furious or anti armor weaps too or instigating
---
I had this problem. I found 2 ways to fix it, only 1 is guaranteed. 
---
1: Remove everything that is higher up than it. Like a second floor or wall that could be connected to it.
---
2: Move camp. You can stay in the same area, but open your inventory and select move (or whatever the proper name is). Doing this will cost you caps, store all of your stuff and move the glitched build into your blueprints, which you can delete without placing, but it works.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Im on PC, I dont really have a specific "build" per se, but I mostly use my furious 25% FFR handmade, I have a couple of loadouts though so I switch between that (rifleman), my guass shotgun and my TSE Minigun
---
Happens often. I scrapped half my camp today to remove one foundation piece despite it not affecting the path between the two parts of my camp in any way whatsoever. I still then had to server hop as I was left with floating half walls which refused to store or scrap - I rebuilt the walls and foundations underneath and it scrapped 2nd time to much relief.
---
Just had to pop back and say I'm now a proud owner of a Mask . Someone saw my post on the xbox trade group and Hooked me up one for free. I'll still countine the grind for the jumpsuits and the others but least now I can have a full set of scout armor with mask in the Fallout first colours.
---
If you open your heart to it and accept the flaws then it is really fun especially on a team with people taking it serious; Just like you have to do for the standard game itself, accept the flaws people and have fun! 
---
Are you that mad about COD and fortnite that you have to bash this mode that is interconnected with Adventure mode to give us rewards , caps and XP. 
---
T
---
C'mon people open your heart and at least give it a chance. Better yet I hope I see you in NW so I can frog leg tea bag your in game corpse bush wookie style !
---
Raiders are for killing.  
---
3 out of my 4 characters have 0 affiliation so I can kill them on sight.  
---
Regrettably they have some of the cooler stuff so I broke down and let one character interact with them.
---
This is one I would argue. As there were variants even on the West coast there now variants on the East coast as well. And the lore you get in the west Tek research center is very plausible at the least. If I'm missing something, please tell me.
---
Oh ok I was going to say if you’re on Xbox I could trade all my furious for your bloodied but never mind. I love my furious explosive railway thing hits like a truck
---
I wouldn’t mind if it were just reworded and rephrased knockoffs of the original. Just some variation would be nice
---
Sounds good! I'll add you and we can make the trade whenever we are both free.
---
What if you dont want to do a stealth build like every other fucking player
---
Good? Kind of you to say. Dedicated is a better word though.  
---
The game definitely rewards persistence.
---
I’ve been listening to them for more like 5 years since it’s all the same music from fallout 4 with about 5 new songs added
---
Cool thanks for the tip. It will save hunting tick blood. xD
---
Yeah I just got my first fully auto and it's great
---
What’s the shotgun? Mine is double barrel I33 with blocker on armour and still I need 2 shots on both assaultron and colonel gutsy. Maybe AA should be best effect on magic shotguns?
---
No, please don't give them more reasons to cash grab.
---
You get points by scrapping your regular perk cards and you'll use them to rank up legendary perk cards.
---
"CAMP builder build"
---
That build you have to explain.
---
Every build can build camps, it's just one or 2 perks that help a little bit while building.
---
&gt; but bloodied/junkies ect will be 1 shotting most things
---
Yes, but so can nearly all other builds. It doesn't matter that the overkill on damage is highest on those 2 builds. Heck even a full health shotty w/o any special build can one shot all.
---
I'm hoping that the brotherhood arriving was part of the "original story plan" as in befor they tossed in the npcs. More like them contacting us or sending a small crew to make sure and finally get rid of the scorched and not just big bad heros comin in.
---
welcome to the wonderful world of RNG.. hope you enjoy your stay
---
Yes sir. Random effects and random number of stars
---
Legendary Perks System Refresher
---
If you weren’t familiar with Legendary Perks from the last PTS, or just want a refresher, here are some details on how this system works:
---
Legendary Perks are new high-level Perk Cards you can access via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Menu, and you can equip them to add even more power to your character builds.
---
You will be able to unlock your first Legendary Perk slot at level 50, and new ones at certain level milestones after that: 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. 
---
Your characters who are already high-level will immediately have access to one Legendary Perk Slot for each of the above leveling milestones they've reached. 
---
For example, a level 250 character will have access to 5 Legendary Perk slots, with the ability to open a sixth slot at level 300. 
---
Each Legendary Perk has 4 Ranks, and you can use new “Perk Coins” to rank them up. 
---
Earn Perk Coins by scrapping your unused normal Perk Cards. 
---
Legendary Perk slots are account-wide.
---
Here's the list of the Legendary Perks so far (subject to change): 
---
-  **Ammo Factory** - produce 50%/75%/100%/150% more rounds when crafting ammo. Yes it does stack with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
   - **Funky Duds** - +50/+100/+150/+200 poison resist when wearing matching armour or power armor
---
   - **Blood Sacrifice** - When you die, teammates gain +25/+30/+35/+40 DR and heal 40/50/60/70 HP over 8/10/12/14 seconds
---
   - **Brawling Chemist** - generate 1/1/1/2 combat enhancing chem every 60/50/40/40 minutes. Up to a max of 3/4/5/5.
---
   - **Hack and Slash** - 20%/30%/40%/50% chance for melee VATS to do area damage
---
   - **Collateral Damage** - enemies killed with melee have 10%/13%/16%/20% chance to explode
---
   - **Detonation Contagion** - enemies killed by thrown explosives have 20%/30%/40%/50% chance to explode
---
   - **Electric Absorption** - 10%/13%/16%/20% chance energy attacks recharge your power armor's fusion core.
---
   - **Exploding Palm** - While unarmed, 5%/10%/15%/20% chance of triggering an explosion on attack hits.
---
   - **Far Flung Fireworks** - Enemies killed with a ranged weapon have a 10%/13%/16%/20% chance to explode
---
   - **Sizzling Style** - +50/+100/+150/+200 fire damage resist when wearing matching armour or power armor
---
   - **Follow Through** - Ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 10%/20%/30%/40% for 10 seconds
---
   - **Legendary Ability** - +1/+2/+3/+5 to stat and +1/+2/+3/+5 to available perk slots (one for each SPECIAL but cannot go over the 15 point cap)
---
   - **Master Infiltrator** - auto unlock skill 0/1/2/3 terminals and locks. +3 Lockpick and Hacking skills.
---
   - **Nuclear Proliferator** - generate 1/1/1/2 lightweight mininuke every 60/50/40/40 minutes. Up to a max of 3/4/5/5.
---
   - **Power Armour Reboot** - 15%/20%/30%/40% chance to auto revive with full health if you're downed in PA.
---
   - **Power Sprinter** - while in PA, sprinting consumes 20%/30%/40%/50% fewer AP.
---
   - **Retribution** - blocking a melee attack restores 1/2/3/4 HP and 1/2/3/4 AP for 15 seconds.
---
   - **Survival Shortcut** - generate 1/1/1/2 survival aiding chem every 30/25/20/20 minutes. Max 5/6/7/10.
---
   - **Taking One For The Team** - enemies take 10%/20%/30%/40% more damage when they attack you, if you're on a team.
---
   - **What Rads?** - +50/+75/+100/+300 rad resist, restore 1/2/3/6 rads per second.
---
I’ve fought mudcrabs...
---
I really want a Julie questline where you get her nuka cola and holotapes with new music, this is such a good idea. I loved in fo4 where you help Travis and then his whole personality changes.
---
No, they aren’t. There were relevant pre-war experiments being conducted, and this is even mentioned in FO1.  Super Mutants weren’t exclusive to the West Coast.
---
Ah shame, oh well.   
---
Ive seena a couple railway rifles and yeah they can be potent, my friend had a bloodied explosive 1 atv1 point and it was lethal, i think he put the fletechs on it or something that made it like a shotgun
---
Add another foundation to your existing one that holds the stairs. (Or just  to any of the foundations really, I think) Scrap the stairs and then the foundations. That usually does the trick for me.
---
It has a 20% chance to spawn but we usually kill any other spawns and keep checking back at the spawn point to see if she has appeared.
---
It's me, I'm that person.
---
Oh and thank you!
---
Upvote for the reference
---
They shouldn't revoke the license, don't think so
---
2 users posted there experience in your thread
---
In the worst way you just loose the steam launch option, progress is still in the Bethesda launcher
---
8 rn
---
Honestly I just run the main events that have a high amount of enemies.
---
Radiation rumble, line in the sand, monster mash, guided meditation.(all fine solo except line in the sand because barely any enemies spawn)
---
I have a few places I visit can’t think of the names but I just jump servers and repeat.
---
The funny thing is, I found it so easy leveling up when this was the only game I was really playing but since I’ve only been doing the challenges and getting off I feel like it takes twice as long... probably all in my head.
---
Vicious cycle of collect legendary items, trade for modules, do dailies for notes, craft and repeat.
---
Thank you sir!
---
I guess it's good I got two 3 star arms then.
---
Just having 1 Animal alive will yield you nothing in the event. Try to have at least 3 people (including yourself) in the end. Before starting the event clear out all the rooms and repair the turrets for support and distraction. Then each person designate yourself to a habitat: you to the meat habitat, someone else to the aquatic habitat, and the last person to the toxic habitat. Be sure to be high level so you can survive without backup. 
---
Max level animals are Deathclaw, Giant Sloth, and Mirelurk King.
---
For Radstags its easy just kill them.
---
For Radkelp just run around and keep gathering as fast as you can.
---
For Toxic Sluge, collect the pile 1 at a time. When you collect one wait for the 2 mole rats to pop up infront of you and Duke them collect their sludge and repeat. 
---
You should get high enough animals that can tank hits on their own.
---
My furious is around 400 damage and I fell you I never liked railways and always scripped them. Then I had this one and I had a whole bunch of spikes. Well went and used it on queen once I learned automatic and it was the best weapon. I used the 4K spikes quick
---
Good point.
---
Yeah that's how it works. You can't sell or trade them so you either have to put unwanted piece's in the scrip machine or send them to the void. You'll have to keep rolling until you get what you want. I got a complete set of Unyielding in roughly 60 rolls all together.
---
I say camp builder build as it kind of best summed up what i meant but also not really, so like someone who has all relevent camp perks on like home defense and stuff, longer food depletion in camps, crafting perks, lockpick and hacking on ect... Basically a "perks that should he passive but arent" build
---
Add to what can’t be scrapped...another foundation and another floor connected to the existing floor at the top of your stairs and then try to delete
---
You should be able to loot when you are nearby legendary and get at least % of experience when someone kills enemies during events.
---
Myron didn’t invent Jet. 
---
First, there is a woman that tells her story of being addicted to Jet and kicked out of Vault City, which occurred before Myron was born. 
---
Second, there is a high-Intelligence speech option where you can accuse Myron of lying, and he stumbles to defend himself. 
---
The fact of the matter is that Myron found an *easier* way to make Jet, and built up his reputation around that. 
---
He’s intelligent, but he’s a liar.
---
I avoid public events unless u want those bullion notes but I have really good luck finding 3 star legendaries just roaming around high areas of the map.literally the whole left side of the map top to bottom.freddys house of scarves I found a 3 star today westeck I found 2 behind westeck was another all within about a hour.hell I even found a explosive mutants combat shotty in a train vendor for 800 caps
---
Yep. They work soooo harddd 😁
---
As long as you’re happy with the effects on them
---
Probably because you don't have 800 pounds of shit in your inventory.  
---
I'm convinced this game runs better when you don't have a ton of shit on you.
---
Around the time of Season 3 the plan is to  introduce a 'One Wasteland'  that should help even out the damage potential of hi/lo player mixes. In theory it's great but I suspect there will be a new arms race as the current 'must 1 shot everything' player sees things change the most.
---
Same. I don't even dare touch Hunter/Hunted radio lol.
---
If you see the event "Leader of the Pack" show up in the top left corner, make sure to do that. It spawns 3 low level legendary wolves, which aren't too hard to kill, and might drop some good stuff for you.  
---
Look for anything "instigating" for weapons, and "Rejuvenating" for armor. At your level anything is pretty good, save for maybe "Nocturnal"
---
Appalachian Missed Connections
---
It’s not every 50 levels.
---
It’s level 50,75,100,150,200 and 300.

If your on PC, I can hop in and help kill her.
---
Its a shame you have to scrap it, or rush their quests just to shut them up. Lol. 
---
But yeah i had to wait cus i'm playing with the wife and we want to do quests together.
---
I guess by killing more things and RNG-ing over again? Hell I don't know.
---
Well 50, with one exception...ok 2
---
From the people that brought you Fallout First, it’s Fallout First Premium.
---
For an additional 20.00 USD a month, you unlock exclusive content like new songs we just paid the royalties for and a plushie of Todd going through your wallet while he sodomizes you.
---
And evolving lines from the DJ too!  The same quips between songs, over and over...
---
Heavy Guns and Power armour builds gang
---
According to this site, [Overseer Rank](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank) (Scroll to the bottom.), 13,001 xp.
---
I didn't like the second but it's not horrible, I guess I need to build more to see how my luck is.
---
This is true and loading times and lag and... 
---
Empty stash, no notes, no camp to load, no holotapes, no 147382 different things for the game to load.
---
There not being a bluegrass station or any bluegrass songs at all in Appalachia (while Dear Hearts &amp; Gentle People makes yet another appearance) is just immersion breaking
---
Thank you again. Really appreciate it.
---
I think you misunderstand.  I had no diseases.  Plague walker is supposed to do nothing if you don't have a disease.  It breaks stealth even with none.
---
I havent been able to expand my emote wheel in like two weeks lol
---
Don't want to believe then check out the Steam stats page...or are they liers too? 
---
https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/
---
It also goes up and down regularly but the max/min are pretty similar over the daily cycles. Numbers have declined over the time it's been available but there's no great collapse due to the ban wave as people have claimed over and over again.
---
A well spec’ed PA heavy gunner can be the damage dealer as well. Vampire weapons work good because they can just unload on her and never have to worry about dying. It’ll just take longer to kill her if you aren’t bloodied, stealthed or junkies. But to be the person tanking the pylons you don’t have to be a stealth build. Just throw on the Chinese stealth suit.
---
The atom shop barrel with the plant doesn't seem to do anything from what i've seen at other player camps. From my understanding so far only the radiation rumble barrel does prompt you to get rads.
---
It takes a total of \~27,000 exp to unlock it. If you started NW when the Season started, it will unlock between Ranks 23 and 24.
---
The people making the game have no idea what the game is about... is all I have left.  My mental image of Battlecry studios is a dozen interns in the basement with old Windows XP desktops (eMachines baby!) making things for the game without ever having seen it, much less played it.
---
That or their game producer is incompetent and should be fired and replaced with someone who has... ANY experience working with a successful MMO.. hell even a failed one would be an improvement.  Someone who understands Android/IOS game standards don't work in AAA PC/Console games.
---
Yes, there is even a volume control that lets you adjust the game volume to music volume ratio. I usually have the game volume at 100% and the music volume at about 20-25% . Sometimes I'll pause the music if there is a holotape that I want to hear, but other than that it doesn't interfere with the game at all. I've used Spotify with Forza, GTA V, and a lot of other games too. The integration is pretty amazing.
---
Yeah pretty much 75 is only an additional 25 and the level 300 is 100 a part. I get if they were unlocked every 50 levels than 300 would only Be 50 above what would have been an unlock.
---
I think it works out better because it gives newer players a chance to get to 3 slots without so much difficulty but in the long run it’s much for much.
---
Huh.  I know gauss rifles just fall apart, maybe shotguns do too?
---
You're talking about destroying, not scrapping lol
---
No I think I was around level 2 to 3 so prob next level or so and the xp still counts between every account for this right?
---
Nope. You’re fine. Just don’t put them down yourself.
---
Do it gunblazing as it happens most of the time. This is just an option, those "the best way" " the easiest way" titles are just OP opinions.
---
Up until I ran out of stash space I was doing that and selling them cheap in my vendor. I'd have higher level fixers charging more and it was amazing just how many players still have never gotten a fixer in the game
---
FYI  those long list of  numbers are exactly in line with the 20-35k I stated. So how does that disprove what I wrote?
---
They aren't bugs, they're features, it's a hidden difficulty setting.
---
As long as you keep a low profile while doing it your just fine
---
(Doesnt mean you should do it but you be fine)
---
Hence the *technically* haha but yeah.
---
Wow they down voted the hell out of you for telling them the truth. I used to think the /r/apexlegends sub was bad, but damn.
---
And you cant be banned from having duped items by what I'm told.
---
And while we are at it, how about some new hair,  face paint, and tattoos.
---
Choose three words.  I try looking for ING ending or ED ending to see if the right number of letters match to give me an idea.  
---
Then,  look for the bracket sets, those will eliminate duds and reset your tries.
---
If you get your tries reset then try three more words.  If still no luck then exit out and you can try again (do this before using your last attempt).
---
I don't know what that means, but I'm happy for you.  I just really like heavy metal.
---
I really thought I was the only one who was annoyed by her addition... Her voice is so grating and her lines are so unfunny and corny I can't hardly stand it
---
Easiest, although not always the quickest...
---
Just guess 3 times randomly and step out before the 10s lockout. Re-enter and repeat ad nauseum until successful.
---
Put up a sign at your camp that you will pay 25 caps per plasma core.
---
I'm pretty sure this is why private servers run so well.   
---
I'm convinced bethesda uses an xl spreadsheet to store inventory info for all players.
---
My friend said his email said that his characters were deleted and they're not does anyone know if it's just a mistake in the email or is it a delay on the deletion of characters and they will be be gone in some time ?
---
No, don't make that a monthly freebie, Bethesda. It's bad enough most of our "monthly free items" are just paints or skins. We finally got something NEW last month, let's keep it going.
---
Yeah, that's a pretty accurate estimate.
---
I know that to go from Rank 0 to 1 is about 150 exp, and it has a pretty even curve. I'd wager you'll unlock it right around Rank 24 exactly.
---
A lot of people did, but I think it was more high end stuff.
---
Only since last patch, I never repaired for weeks before that...
---
Ah okay, that’s a real bait and switch. I can’t believe that, it looks identical besides the flower on top lol. Thanks friend.
---
That's terrible.
---
lmao thats a straight up lie XD
---
Not sure how you stay alive when the pylons drain your health...I try and just immediately get rekt.
---
First, I just pick one of the words, any word. The computer will tell you the likeness, meaning how many letters of the correct word are in the exact same space as the word you initially picked. Let’s say for example that the likeness of the first word was 2. I’d just spell the other words out loud and see if any of them have the same letters in common with the word I picked initially. If any of the other words met that criteria, I’d guess that word next and the computer will tell you a likeness for that word. Got it wrong? Don’t worry, you get 3 or 4 chances to correctly guess the password. Got it completely wrong, just back out of the computer monitor and try again from the beginning.
---
Since we make our shine and all Copperhead Road would be a great addition too!!!!
---
There's is a intended "way" on how terminal hacking is supposed to be done but honestly nobody does that because it's too time consuming. 
---
You get 4 tries to guess s password based on the keywords display so what people do is that they pick the first 3 words they see and try to brute force their way in. If they didn't unlock the terminal they back out of the terminal (you don't try a 4th time) and your 4 tries are reset and the password choices are randomized again so you once again choose the first 3 words you see and you will repeat this cycle until you hack into the terminal. 
---
People have been "hacking" terminals this way since Fallout 3.
---
I mean like if you didnt actually dupe them yourself, like if you were to buy it out of a vending machine
---
Why not just follow the actual algorithm?  It's so simple.
---
That's Bethesda :-)
---
I didnt even notice the turrets. Thanks now i just gotta fine people and get lucky with the  event starting
---
Ah yes. I agree.
---
Photos!!!! That sounds awesome :)
---
Yep.  Then again, it means magic weapons still exist, so maybe not all bugs have to go.
---
You're welcome, feel free to check other people's camps when they have those barrels to confirm for yourself :)
---
Yeah this. I do try and go out of my way to tap legendary enemies so others can get a hit unless I know there are people around who are aggressive one tapping. The problem is on a bloodied build I can’t Exactly stand around and tanking damage while people run over.
---
How's it more tedious? All your doing by "lining up multiple sales and buys" is seeing all your transactions and seeing that you indeed gained caps instead of having ti do the math. I personally don't buy anything from regular vendors, rip off even with the psrk to lower prices.  I buy from players even tho its not really a good way of selling stuff since you have to be online. We just need a watoga bot that is an auction house.
---
Well I’m level 3 on one level 2 on another and level 25 on main. I will see if when I get to level 26 if I get it. I know I don’t have long being they get rid of it next patch
---
Same here sometimes with PC
---
i also got the full fireman responders set for 1
---
As mentioned elsewhere, they could have a limited daily stock on the items in the Purveyors inventory, in the same way Vault Steel and Legendary Modules have limited stock.  At least this way we're getting rid of weight from our stash, while not really changing anything
---
As someone else noted, you can hover over the letters and find groups of them that will light up.  Click all of those and it will remove duds and reset tries.  Then use the likeness number to figure out which is the right choice. I usually just brute force by trying random words and backing out and trying again. That is just as fast as actually hacking it.
---
Here's my tip for you as a new player go here and plan out a build it will save you a headache later on: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Also remember you don't have to pick a Perk Card associated with the Special stat you increased when you Level up you can for example Increase your Strength but pick a Luck Perk Card.
---
If you ever make a "mistake" while leveling up and working on your build don't worry about it once you get past Lv.50 the game gives you a choice between gaining a new Perk Card or relocating a SPECIAL stat point each time you level up so you will always have the opportunity to "fix" your build.
---
Haha 🤣
---
I'll happily one shot mobs, if it's an event with lower levels I'll try and let them get the bulk of kills and XP as I'll do the objectives. But if it's a decent legendary then you bet your ass as a bloody commando I'm either going to risk my life to hit it with the Rifle stock or I'm not going after it. (occasionally I'll forget to unequip grenades and for that I'm sorry). But I've seen 90% of the time most people sharing legendaries and it becomes second nature to do it also. I don't believe a nerf should be done but I do agree that people need to stop becoming part of the problem for a legendary that's most likely nothing but scrip and stash weight. And Beth definitely needs to make legendaries in events lootable for all in the event.
---
Thanks I'll make sure too
---
Just pew pew more
---
Yeah, that was my weapon before the fixer for the queen. On VATS it was supreme. BRAAAAAP went the ten round mag taking me to critical, about 24 per hit then the next magazine was ALL CRITICALS - over a 1000 right there. Great weapon, but really a specialist. I use a JE fixer now when I'm not getting personal with my junkies DCG.
---
With their shit explosives I have stuff equipped all the time without throwing it. I sometimes throw my floater grenades after an event to get rid of weight and maybe scare another player.
---
You shouldn’t get banned for possession of duped items. Only the person who modified the ammunition machines’ properties (aka the hacker) will most likely have action taken against them.
---
If anyone needs rad barrel on PC lmk. I can hop anytime this evening.
---
It is easy.  Use a shotgun, all pellets will count toward the critical hit count.
---
Just shoot/destroy it no? (No idea how underground bases work but they are kl)
---
Ok thanks I'll watch s few build vids on yt and create one thank you for your advice :)
---
You’ll be fine if you have stealth suit to stay hidden and just use stims constantly. And if you are doing it with someone that can kill the imposter fast then you won’t even have to hold the pylons very long.
---
I had no idea! Thank you!!! ❤️❤️❤️
---
Bruh, our boys can't count. I keep forcibly reloading the Handmade at 14/25. Pisses me off greatly because I like well timed reloads.
---
Yeah afraid so. It doesnt create its own stash, just flags items within the existing one. From what i understand it doesnt even prolong the life of them that much either. I use mine as a decoration
---
I'm sure I'll get downvoted to hell but I disagree. If you cant do basic math that's on you and even if you leave that 1 or 2 script in every day that's at most 7 3* legendarys in an entire year. Come on guys is this really a problem?? If it's that serious I'll give you 7 right now
---
Step one: Choose a word. The system will tell you hoe close you are.  Say you choose WORD.  The system will say you got 0-3 of the letters right. (If you got four right, you guessed correctly) It will tell you this if you got a letter or two or three in correct in the right order.  For example: you chose WORD  but the correct word is LORD. So you got 3 right. Then you look for a word that has 3 letters in WORD but is not WORD.
---
Step two: Search all the lines for code that begins and ends with one of the following () &lt;&gt; []  This eliminates duds and/or resets your tries.
---
Okay im getting on in 20
---
Oh I know,  I think OP wants the ability to get materials from Legendarys.  If they simply wanted them gone they could easily drop them anywhere.
---
Edit: I'm taking this way too serious lol, apologies
---
Haha I didnt know this either
---
I dont think people realize how much of a pain it is to pay for and lisence music for video games.
---
You mean think? Uhg, thinking...
---
Everyone is talking about adding new music via a side quest and having her talk about stuff you do, but wouldn't that be tough?  The news updates according to player activity worked in single payer games, but I'm pretty sure the radio plays the same songs for everybody, so being level 100 and getting about something you did months ago, or being level 3 or 4 and hearing about something that hasn't really happened yet (from your perspective), just game-breaking?  And to add new songs, they'd have to figure out a way to program it into the already existing playlist.
---
Just because you are bad at trading and probably got scammed for this extreme price does not mean we are liars lol.
---
I scroll through line by line to find sets of matching brackets ( ), [ ], &lt; &gt;. They will either remove a dud or reset your tries. After I’ve gone through all the lines, then I’ll go through the words as others have mentioned above. Often times it will remove about half of the words, but sometimes I get lucky and only one word will be left. Rinse and repeat if it doesn’t work the first time.
---
You need to git gud at hoarding ;)
---
Look up Fallout 76 Builds through a browser search. You need a build or you're going to be all over the place and your character will be useless.    
---
Use the Nukes and Dragons site to do this. Near the bottom is an option to see Perks By Level which is a GOOD indicator of what you should do.    
---
Any quest that nets gear (weapons/armor) is 99% of the time done to your level. There are increments ever 10 levels or starting at 15,25,35, 45. Max Gear level is 50. For the best base stats you want them at 45/50 if you can help it.    
---
Some people can do melee only but 99% of enemies have both a melee and ranged attack.    
---
Some builds may be labeled the same or similar you can see the core perks. It's your character so you can modify how you wish.    
---
Grouping is much easier now. The Social tab (R side when you go to the map) is something you should get familiar with. IMO, you should avoid groups and solo for a good 30 levels if not 50 to get the feel for that char/build.    
---
There are many players like myself who love helping new players. Most charge very cheap or might do something for free.    
---
Don't worry about fixing/modding armor until after level 10 maybe 15. The mat cost early on are far less then repairing/modding. For awhile, you can use whatever you find and the game gives you. Something is better than nothing.    
---
I'll stop here and I think you should go in knowing just a little. Pay attention to what the game tells you. Listen to what's going on around you, what people are saying, etc.    
---
Search for a Fallout 76 map by level and stick to it. You'll encounter enemies and quests for those level ranges. If you have any more questions after you start, send me a PM.
---
It’s my opinion but it’s definitely easier to have one person hold all the pylons and remained stealthed rather then 3 separate people who are dying over and over and forcing the imposter to put her shields up.
---
Dupers...uhhh...find a way
---
Yeah I love it but like you said it’s a specialist. It breaks a lot also. But yeah I switched once I got a 2 star bloodied combat and switched my whole build around to do rifles before I just used whatever rifle I had and used my bloodied grognak axe or bloodied death claw. I got the luckiest rolls from purveyor the other week. 3 bloodied weapons in a row. First lever action second fixer then Tesla: only had 300 scrip so it was pure luck. And now I use that fixer and my anti armor handmade.
---
I do this too.
---
I would not worry, you did not put them down.
---
Correct. It worked fine on release but then it broke with one of the updates and they are aware of it. However it was put back in the Atom Shop recenty even though the issue that broke it still hasnt been fixed. Apparently it may be getting fixed the next update but that doesnt alter the fact it was put back on sale while knowing it had issues
---
No sorry
---
I did not have a problem getting the weekly one in one session... but I am bloodied so every 3rd shot is a crit
---
I wouldn't doubt that the Whitespring Protectron has a broker on the Oil Rig and stocks in Poseidon Energy.
---
They thanks that's really nice of you and I'll make sure to take your advice
---
More lines so I spend more time skipping them?
---
to be honest I have about 900, so I'll probably do Lucky Mine run's till it's gone as it was only 5-10m despite not knowing the place that well for 700 lead.  If you have the acid it is the best.
---
I'm great at Hoarding, but having an unlimited scrap prevents me from having to run multiple characters.
---
It is the apocalypse and typical of ANY MMO limited world or like WoW.    
---
I hate that stuff. I've read you have to do enough damage to be able to loot the Legendary and high level enemies.    
---
I as using an alt who was level 14 at the time and looking for "Leader of the Pack" but that tends to net gear for levels 10-20. Perfect for gearing that character. It's also good for racking up the number count for killing X number of Legendary enemies.    
---
Jot that person's user down and 'educate' them.
---
Yep it gets expensive. Even GTA gave up paying for the licensing of some of the music it once had.
---
I just make them, because it's easier than farming them, at least for me. I also buy them sometimes when I see someone selling them cheap.
---
Yeah I’m dumb but these are easy... I’m shocked to see people say that nobody does it the intended way.
---
They're not trolls. Don't you want enemy A.I. to be more challenging than pathetically easy?
---
Ikr
---
I boop them then do the follow me emote.
---
I've always done this on all fallout games with terminals and hacking.
---
Twice as fast if you can plunk “Critical Savvy” in your Luck perks for awhile.
---
Holy SHIT! you sir are great
---
Can I ask you about something that is really important to me? Are leg.cards upgrades account wide? Are points account wide?
---
I use to put mine in the lunch bowl, but it's never used. Now I put it into my Nuka-cola machine, and I'm having a heard time keeping it stocked. It gives me a chuckle when I come back to my base to see it used
---
Season 3 is going to be around January right.  Hopefully it fixes some of it.  It just sucks when I'm trying to help low lv players and you get a one hit commando taking it away from others.
---
if you turned a rifle into a pistol the rifle perks will no longer apply.. that is correct...
---
This and t 51 now having the best damage resistance in game(beside t 65) are nice corrections bethesda made
---
Nah, This is America.
---
1 - Equip all three ranks of the Hacker perk to minimise **'lockout'** time.  
---
2 - Randomly choose words, and pay no attention.  
---
3 - Get locked out for less than 1 second after 4 failed attempts.  
---
4 - Repeat.  
---
5 - Eventually get in, using minimal required effort/attention.  
---
6 - Wonder who the hell approved this stupid mechanic thinking it was fun, and curse them thoroughly.
---
Me either.    
---
I do have a set I've finagled together from various version parts on a frame in my Stash. That char is a Stealth Sniper VATS solo and will probably never use it.
---
So i need to unlock the automatic pistols perk? Okay thank you. Didnt know if it just called it a pistol because of the mods didnt know there were conversions in this game. Thank you
---
It sucks for sure.  I found by setting an example you can sometime mitigate this issue.  So for uranium fever if your the first one at the boss, smack it with your gun but or carry a low powered alternative.  A lot of people seem to get  the idea.  But there are dicks out there and it sucks sometimes.  I can tell you at level 300 something, for me it does not matter I have enough scrip and given the current game I am just there to catch Zorbo.  But I feel you.
---
There should be a perk called Scrounger in luck. Will find additional ammo in ammo containers. That be your best chance
---
If you're on Xbox ive got like 600 cores thats just sitting on a mule character
---
Ahahahaha, even Apex legends adds new music every season!!!!!  You just gave me yet another reason to be completely fed up with Bethesda!!!
---
How I hack terminals: select random words until I guess correctly.
---
OR
---
If one of the words I’ve guessed has a high likeness (2-3) go through the other words and see which ones have the same letter in the same position as the word originally selected and try those
---
I agree, there are plenty of legionaries if you do the walk
---
Music costs money. Buy more atoms.
---
I'll usually do this then push the fill trys command that you can find
---
On top of this, the correct answer is *usually* located in one of the four corners.  I pick 3/4 random corner words and 9/10 I get the hack without having to retry.
---
Oh I remember my first wild ride around the map, sometimes now I just do it because I get bored :)
---
There's been a bug with plague walker forever that acts like you have a disease even when they expire, it causes you to "attack" neutral targets, (which is another bug with plague walker, they're not supposed to expire)
---
As long as i can still hear "OH ZAZU"
---
That joke was fun in early 2019 to newbies in the forest. Now if I drink it from your camp,i'll empty them all and don't even look at what you have to sell.
---
Yea got more then enough treasure notes (40) that the limit stopping me from getting more.  I normally help out low lv players show them how certain event get run.  Campfire was helping others.  Violent night was me and a random group.  It just sucks because I have run with group that have one hitters and they stay back untill everybody gets a hit in on it.
---
Depends on your definition of "lots". I only started playing NW for the Legendary Run SCORE, and once I get my daily SCORE from NW, I quit playing. I unlocked the suit a week ago.
---
Lool one time I was over limit with no station or anything around me so I drank till I got near a station
---
Hey don't take it personal, there is plenty of post titled that way, even myself did it some time. I'm saying people could do what they want with it, there is no rules on how to play the game. I understand what are you showing and, as I said below, thank you for sharing. Although 99% of my Encryptid runs are succesfull, I will test this strategy.
---
Gah! That's the main thing I've been looking forward to 😭
---
on a magic carpet ride, dating my self:)
---
Swap perks around to something else that works for the event and do it that way.  You don't really need to stealth if you don't want to, and it can be soloed multiple ways so you don't need the second person.
---
Peeps have different clans, or homies, or rp groups. Include your platform
---
Dude if you think the player count is changing 10K every second, then forget it.  It's a random # generator between a range.
---
Can we have a questline to meet the host of Appalachia Radio? Maybe introduce another 5-10 songs alongside it, and have the player do a quest to recover the holotapes with the music for the new songs. It should be something substantial though, not just one more "fetch this easy item, kill this bot" Ally questline.
---
Tisk man , and please add more to power armor mods and make tesla coils increase energy dmg because lord knows we need it sweeeeet jeeesus hallelujah!!!!! *shakes hands in the air*
---
Just load up on all the Copper, Lead, Nuclear Material, and plastic you come across and craft them with super duper and ammosmith perks turned on.
---
Adios Camp. To quote Eugenie “Time to get a moooove on.”
---
Dude I have had all sorts of camp spawn fun from drowning to getting f..ked in the ass by everything.  Have a nukcashine and go for a ride:)  JK I feel you
---
Fuck me, Alan Turing will be turning in his grave.....
---
Thanks for the reminder. Made an edit to include Xbox
---
The modules let you craft legendary weapons and armor but only for weapons and armor plans you bought through gold bullion, if I’m not mistaken.
---
They are for crafting solar/thorn &amp; SS
---
You use them to make certain weapons and armor. Specifically the ones obtained via bullion.
---
Necessary component for crafting specific “legendary” weapons and armor (unlocked faction stuff for example). One needed per armor piece, two needed per weapon. They don’t bring regular weapons and armor up to “legendary status”, no. 
---
Armor
---
- Secret Service armor
---
- Solar armor
---
- Strangler heart power armor
---
- Thorn armor
---
Weapons
---
- Cattle prod
---
- Gauntlet
---
- Gauss minigun
---
- Gauss pistol
---
- Gauss shotgun
---
- Plasma caster
---
It shows 6K online now, and it NOT changing like the fake page you linked to above. Thanks for helping illustrate what I was saying.
---
And yes there is a reason they unbanned everyone.

It is fun I have to say but man what a wild ride :)
---
El is right. 
---
But if you are asking if there is an ingame guild or clan system, like an MMO, the flat answer is no
---
Agreed that it is dumb.  Glad I saved you the aggravation I just went through.  Save your tokens for the costume...or until they fix it so you can display them.  I wanted the set of 4 (which I think are random) but now I'm not even going to bother.
---
1700 hours into adv and still haven't been on nw tab
---
Thanks to all that give advice I'm glad I'm in a supportive community
---
Why not listen to videogame music instead of normie music? Aka the official game sound track for wandering in the wilderness, not some human voice noise
---
I hear you  especially now alot of people have very powerful guns.i do keep a 10mm pistol that's fun as hell for those events but I think some people find pleasure in 1shoting u know
---
Thanks.
---
Looks interesting but a couple questions.
---
Why none of the other HG str perks? Like bear arms or bullet shield?
---
Why no iron clad?
---
I have run with ransoms and had one hitters run away from the legendary untill everybody gets a hit.  Hell earlier today did heart of the swamp and when the queen popped up a person ran away and waited untill everybody got a hot then hit it with a shotgun.  He died twice in the process but It was helpful (got a vampire minigun).  I get that bloody builds die easy but if you are leading the legendary or boss towards people most likely somebody will revive you.  I appreciate players that do that and message them if they need anything.  Most say no had few ask for ammo or small things.
---
Camp being nuked is what I'm secretly afraid of in game, I nervously check the blast zone every time the quest starts.  As for SBQ.. I try to pull my weigh during fights, but I'm taking it easy, because I got disconnected half way a few times not being in a team, so I never got the payback for all the ammo and meds and time. Frustrating.
---
They added ring of Fire, awhile back lol I lowkey want big iron or Johnny cash on the radio.
---
Why would you join an event known for having a single legendary on the best of days and have any expectation of tagging it? 
---
Those lesser events are usually ground out for scrip, treasury notes, and challenge/experience. If I'm really hurting for legendaries there are dozens of places that aren't even events where you can easily find upwards of 3 legendaries. Or events like radiation rumble that sometimes have upwards of 6.
---
And if you always make sure to be in a full team actively working the events it vastly improves your chance to have an ally tag a legendary for you. 
---
If your that bad at tagging legendaries better to adapt to using Tesla rifles, grenades, or explosive weapons, and most importantly always running with a full group.
---
You cant change how others play the game and trying to force others to play the game the way you want will get you nowhere fast, but you can easuly adapt your own playstyle to maximize efficiency and minimize headaches.
---
Thanks
---
2nd paragraph I agree with. If you take part in the event auto loot the boss mechanic, I like it, but, typically it's just a scrip item anyway so I shrug it off. If it's a newer player it's a bummer but I'm a bloodied stealth archer so I'm absolutely the problem according to the OP
---
Scrip system is horrible. All these dailes that are capped it's like they want us to stop playing their own game. 150 daily scrip is too small maybe increase it to 200 or 300 and allow us to carry 1500 or 2k.  And having un even scrip like 3 for a armor piece is just dumb just make it 5....
---
This is wrong on so many levels
---
Sorry, I was mistaken. I do not have it.
---
Although it is a newer song Black Lung by The Dead South would fit this game perfectly!
---
its only there when you are going to hit max
---
Magic only happens in VAST and sometimes you cannot hit the enemy with a 95% hit chance.
---
Wait never mind no I went there already
---
Ahh ok. So what ill need to be looking for is an "rp Group" or something to connect with other players.
---
I use melee and occasionally a 10mm and got thru the 50 basically in one line in the sand event
---
You may not actually hack the terminal... but many do. It’s much faster than guessing randomly and getting locked out
---
sure, I do not see why not.
---
Yea had it  twice.  I do it because got a chance to get possum tokens.  Easier to do those challenge mission that may not even work right
---
Probably not. I’m at 26 on my wife’s account, and I figure I can grind it out.
---
Yikes thanks though
---
Pretty much! Shouldnt be hard to find.
---
Its not a perfect game, but there are still plenty of fans. I would offer, but my group plays on ps4.
---
or you could put a stock on it and it will be a rifle again
---
it's all about that daily login.
---
He's choppin he''s choppin he's choppin
---
Same! Loudly too.
---
Well the thought is appreciated   :)
---
I'm pretty hooked on the game and just hit level 45. Looking forward to playing more.
---
Pick a word it will tell you how many characters are correct. Try and guess based off that until you have 1 guess left. Than look for brackets when you hover over them it will select a bunch of random characters. These will get rid of duds, reset your guesses ect.
---
I’m a super new player, what is scrip ? Can’t say I’ve seen it in game yet
---
It’s crazy. Some people actually think it’s completely random lol
---
NP.
---
Got to experience a couple during Fashnacht.  Someone had set their camp on the hill below horizon rest...
---
Was there a rebalance that I missed? I feel like it was pretty standard when the game came out that people were launching nukes by level 50. Granted normally in at least pairs but still. 
---
Unless this guy either didn't bring armor to the fight or had no build of any kind.
---
Every chance I get I turn people's shit off lol... I'm glad I'm getting to some of you, muahahahaha
---
Check out r/pkoa
---
That’s an idea I hadn’t thought about. Hmm.
---
"They chased me down until I took it". The fallout 76 community will not rest until noobs accept their kindness.
---
Healing Factor doesn't work during combat, which is when you want it to work. Sometimes players think it works during combat because they are unknowingly using the auto-health regeneration bug associated with Speed Demon and Adrenal Reaction. This bug has been fixed in the PTS.
---
I like Healing Factor for my bloodied builds because it reduces the effectiveness of rad away, and bloodied builds don't need full stimpack effectiveness.
---
That’s one the best and most important perks in the game imo
---
Its gonna be real hard. You were suppose to be level 55 on the 27th to be on track
---
You are gonna have to grind out the repeatable 100 SCORE challenge much more than others do
---
except for my Gauss shot guns I laid off on all other explosive shot guns because I one shot them and myself, but I do use magic shot guns so....
---
It must be because the skin has "16 times the detail."
---
Mine was a royal pita to set up, and I think the fissure sight being  literaly next door chases people off from wanting to build there, despite the bat almost never showing. But may alts Will not be placed there,
---
At this point are we surprised?
---
Yup.  Anytime a nuke goes off in the area, go.
---
Even if you miss out on the queen, there’s lots of other critter, and tons of violet flux.
---
I keep 1 of everything that has no weight
---
As much as I like my fellow bushwookies it's finding a pal in the murky waters I love most
---
Great chart that outlines where you should be and when:

---
True but that don't fix the problem.  Either this is a team game or every man for himself.  Certain events you can solo run. Others like violent night radiation rumble and encryptid  sucks because one shot ruins it for everybody so why would they want to run it or help with it.
---
If you find out let me know!
---
I found you have to un equip it and re equip it for to keep working...it peters out after a while for me
---
That's the spirit!
---
Are you on xbox? I can get you an aa2515 gatling gun if you like heavies
---
Yes, but you would have to grind xp like a mad man. The only thing that can save you rn is that repeatable. I remember when I was rank 30ish some guy posted how he had finished the race thanks to grinding xp. You could do the same.
---
Tips for xp: increase your Intelligence (Unyielding armor, food, and bobbleheads). Also use boost to your xp like canned meat stew, well rested, path to enlightment and lunchboxes. Remember lunchboxes stack up to 1hr.
---
I am lvl 300 hundred something and still have noob moments so never?
---
Noooooo! Did you go into NW or Atom Shop before Adventure? I'm not sure it matters, but others have mentioned it.
---
My main limitation as a noob (level 33) is stash space... But since I kinda have my camp the way I want it for a while, I've been bulking up my junk to sell to vendors and selling junk in my vendor bots and that seems to help. I'm doing Miner miracles right now so will be able to build my power armour station soon and get my power armour out of my inventory.  I collect junk like a hoarder, I'm the type of player who takes everything in sight and I'm definitely paying for it, haha.  
---
My biggest gripe is the lack of a "take all" option... like when you come up to a full container or looting your dropped loot when you die, why can't there just be a "take all" option?!?
---
I have done this since fallout 3, 4 and new Vegas
---
Yah I do those to get possum points too, but have never seen Nia, nor have received any tokens from the event.  Is there a certain way we should be doing it?
---
True understand I do have private but there are something a lot more fun in public.  For instance not to many of my friends like playing project paradise violent night or encryptid.  If I want to run those I need to be in a public event.
---
Yup. Can you simply favorite the mine or must you enter your pipboy?
---
HeHe. All good! Cheers!!
---
I spend most of my time working on camp building and I have no problems one shotting most high level mobs.and that's even when I forget to swap off my camp perks to combat ones.
---
You don't even need to be bloodied or junkies to do it, just research the magic damage weapon types and make sure you have at least 1 item with the correct prefix. 
---
But most importantly make sure your on an active team when attending any event to maximize chances of getting legendary loot.
---
Had a friend with me in radiation rumble yesterday whose game crashed for most of the event and he still managed to pick up several legendaries due to having been grouped and within proximity of me.
---
What is the skin supposed to do if working correctly?
---
I will never understand why they didn't include The West Virginia Hills. It fits 76 so perfectly and all its trademarks have expired, all they would have to do is get someone to sing and play it 
---

---
Thx for the recommendation
---
You need to reach rank 91 and you can buy the rest with the atoms you gained to that point, so it's a little easier than the full 100. And there's also going to be bonus score later to help.
---
But tbh I think you are still too far back at this point as the straight line xp grind should be mid/late 50s by now. Maybe set your sights a little lower and grind for a 'must have' reward such as the Chicken Coop and anything else is a bonus.
---
Not at the normal rate. But with the auto-complete bug still going strong I imagine Bethesda will implement more ways to catch up. I say keep grinding if you’re willing and hopefully more double score/xp weekends are on the way.
---
This is a good point.
---
Nope its random.  Same with the daily to get the bug stuff.  Sometime I get a token other times none
---
Same, I first drank it for the quest (I didn't know what would happen) together with a friend. My ride was indeed very wild. Now I want to spread the fun of adventuring and stock my bowls and vending machine. I also sell some.
---
Don't even get me started!
---
I thought it was him! He sounded like the drifter but younger and less husky. Lol! 😂 I can't even escape destiny 2 whilst playing Fallout. They're my two fave franchises. Lol
---
While I’m not sure about the ‘multiple’ discovery theory (since Jet was established as a pre-War drug), the part about only first-hand observations being 100% valid to view as canon is very valid. 
---
Too many players assume that what their characters are told by NPCs or even log entries is always truthful.  That’s a very odd assumption.
---

---
New word?
---
Eh... I just use a character who has never played nw. My level 68 can sit this daily out
---
I have a feeling that a lot of the problems with the game running like hot garbage is due to server issues. VATS not working right half the time in particular.
