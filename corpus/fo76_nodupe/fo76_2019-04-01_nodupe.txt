I pretty much always listen to the classical channel when I play now. 
---
Sorry to kinda highjack this, but i took a screen of my first radstorm too while hanging at one of my early camp :

---
Um no? 90% of Bethesda games are amazing imo but for the past 5 months they‚Äôve done nothing but shit the fucking bed lol 
---
Yea takes 20 hours to fill their caps back. Basically there isn't a faster way besides selling to other players but that takes time too. If you think about it you can make just under 10k a week from vendors which will be more since you have to play to get stuff to sell to them. Just takes a little time man. 
---
Because it is an american civil war gun? There is the gatling laser if you wanna be futuristic. I love my gatling. Could be a lil more steampunk tho :P
---
If they had a Hot Rodder Pink fluffy cat collar and a Cats/Dogs Top Hat for 800 Atoms im the guy that would buy that .
---
I posted a similar post awhile back &amp; an imaginative redditor suggested themed furniture like rugs and quilts and things made from the Hides that drop around the world
---
Same goes for Robots - they let us craft unique robots and then they sell some sweet Robot paint packs im sure plenty of people will drop Atoms for Robot paints / voice packs.
---
One can only hope :)
---
Now I want a civil war pepper grinder skin for the gatling gun lol 
---
They are progressing this game just like elder scrolls online (and elder scrolls online is extremely profitable for them). Everyone was pissed about this being online, but we knew what we were getting into when YOU ( and me ) purchased this game for 60$. And honestly,, besides all the bullshit they put us through,,, I still got my 60$ worth. Could it be better, HELL YES. but we all knew the moment they said it's Mulitplayer what it was going to be. There are a lot of interesting things they have done with this and I do like the direction they are going.. just wish they were putting content out quicker, or just adding more tougher enemies for late game. That would hold us down until new content arrives. With that being said.... stop posting like a little bitch, you can properly state your thoughts about a game without caplocks on. 
---
Good day sir.
---
Exactly!!! But as it is it's kinda nice to be able to do and jump right back into fighting if you want to
---
That's kind of their sense of humor though. Like, they were criticized for releasing Skyrim repeatedly so they put the game on Amazon Echo.
---
Personally, I like that they're able to make fun of themselves. I mean, it'd be one thing if they were laughing about it but not fixing it, but they're not.
---
Sorry, just saw this! Yes, these are new to me! I will add them to my list tomorrow when I have time. Thank you very much for contributing!
---
I think there's a sub dedicated to FO76 camp building, but i forgot the url.
---
My first time ever playing the game I was exploring down the road from vault 76 and a high level stopped me and dropped a bag with ammo, a nice modded hunting rifle, and full leather armor. 
---
He told me ‚ÄúGood luck out there‚Äù and fast traveled away. Man I‚Äôve never had anything close to that happen in a video game. The people in this game are great.
---
Excellent write up. I still have a few questions though.
---
How does reactive plates work? Say for example I got hit for 100 ballastic damage before DR mitigation and actual damage to my health is 20. Does the attacker get hit for 50 ballastic before mitigation or 10 direct damage to health? Does it work for energy and radiation damages as well? Grenades and mines? Slash damage from direct and indirect explosions?
---
Also for targeting HUD, does it work against chameleon and stealth boy? Behind walls? 
---
But you can't fast travel into a Nuke Zone though
---
Ooof someone took this extremely personal (btw adding more tougher enemies doesn‚Äôt make sense lol you don‚Äôt need the ‚Äúmore‚Äù their bucko lol 
---
Ive already got Hard Bargain maxed out.
---
Thank you. 
---
Yeah this would be amazing - let us grow all sorts of things - from fungi to the rarer plants that we cant grow now
---
watch [captainoob](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-i6epzK3hAhVFn-AKHUD2DUwQFjAAegQIABAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCE6rlbDvll5tS8htVIVl90A&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RTqfADna17brB0Ty9QUSY), do what he does.
---
I live near there on xb1. When I get the notification that my camp can't be placed, I go see who has my spot.
---
You don't have to take pictures of just your player character, environment too. Manipulate the lighting with your camera angle and it makes all the difference: https://imgur.com/a/6441yXE#ixob7uv
---
Good to know. Ill have to hit up the workshops now.
---
Thanks!
---
I do this with my TSE guns all the time. I too, is a moron
---
Yes but Skyrim was an amazing game sure it had problems but the pros out weighted the cons by a mile! Also I‚Äôm glad you and me are being very civil and aren‚Äôt swearing, cussing, or just being a rude and I‚Äôll take your opinion and agree with you 
---
There were not guns of this caliber in the Civil War, so it doesn't even make sense. My issue is that there is clearly a disconnect of what the Gatling Gun was SUPPOSED to look like and what it actually does look like. Least they can do is update the default model for the Gatling Gun but keep the pepper-grinder variant as a skin or something for "legacy" players.
---
Today I was doing a technical data drop when a lvl 160 player dropped a bag for me(I‚Äôm lvl 65), I couldn‚Äôt believe what was inside-a plan for the nuka cola x01 power armour paint job,many thanks kind stranger,what an awesome community we have here,btw low lvls pls stop running away when I‚Äôm trying to give you bags of goodies in flatwoods,I‚Äôm not that scaryüòÇ
---
In one of the updates they made plans easier to find by certain vendors selling certain plans but really jacked up the price on them.
---
Hey look at that my point proven exactly lol
---
Yeah - it would be awesome..... 
---
now the marketer in me says they add a quest where you find a wounded pet (cat or dog) and have to nurse it back to health so you get the pet for free..... but add vanity items in the store for it ;)
---
Yes, most even come semi auto 
---
Yes, just change the receiver 
---
Actually they did invent the transistor. I think somewhere in the 2050s. Thats why robco were able to make machines such as Mister Handys and Protectrons. Thats also how Modus, John Caleb Bradberton and Mr House can even exist. Obviously their transistors were not as powerful or compact as ours are but thats because they have only had 30 years while we have had roughly 70.
---
No sir. No benefit to using them. Launcher is heavy in itself, as well as missles weighing in at 1lb. I don't have the explosive weight reduction perk, that may help with missle weight? But the speed of delivery of damage just doesn't hack it. I have lever actions that are far more effective. Sucks, because missle launchers are supposed to be cool. 
---
If someone drinks and runs over my dog, then apologizes, i will still shit all over that motherfucker.
---
Nevertheless apologizing would be the only right thing to do by him.
---
If he doesnt even apologize, that just tells me that he doesnt care and will run over more dogs in the future.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And unsurprisingly Bethesda seems to be doing exactly that. Todd Howard said the mobile game will have 'light' monetization and now here we are with 31$ loot boxes.
---
The lying continues and this subreddit keeps on bending over.
---
A more refined version of your idea: MODUS has been lacing the simulation with real world events it has been observing through the satellite we help "reconnect" it to do "prove our commitment".
---
  
---
We have tons of dead people with stories that don't chronologically fit as occurring during the same period. Only recordings and bodies.
---
MODUS and the bunker were built by Vault Tec. The Enclabe wasnt a fan about how much they were involved in construction.
---
The first Responders to hit the scene essentially ignored the Charleston provincial government, set up their own stuff, and based their efforts around setting up survival instructions all over the areas immediately outside the Vault. My guess is that the Responders have been engineered by Vault Tec from the start.
---
Yeah pretty sure theres only 3 auto receivers and like 9 semi auto ones. 
---
they aren't rare if you grind it out, just like anything in this game legendaries can be farmed, it takes time, and some stuff is crap, but you can find good gear if you just grind it out.  that said I can't wait for the legendary vendor.
---
Yep mine is semi auto
---
Id say the fact that ive done 300 hours of grinding with only 1 tse and no be makes them pretty rare but sure
---
That‚Äôs not the scenario we are talking about.  If they were going to participate, obviously that‚Äôs fine.
---
Yeah it sucks, I used to buy the plans for 600 and resell for 1k on the bazaar subreddit. Now I can‚Äôt even afford the plans for my alts 
---
There's also a chance for a very rare reward like a legendary drop or plans. Its one of a small number of right at the start of the game events one of my characters does over and over trying to get shadowed leather armor plans from.
---
You're playing a fictional scifi game with things like mothman, super mutants, power armor... And you want to nitpick about civil war weaponry in the game? 
---
I keep a few luck points available for Starched Genes and Class Freak, but I never seem to get a decent mutation so I use the open perks to conserve screws/ballistic fiber and to scrounge up a little more ammo. If you only want offensive power you can swap them out for Bloody Mess later, so you're not wasting the points. It's the 14 points of weight reduction perks that really cut into my SPECIAL allowance. I just tested my encumbrance after a loot run and without the perks I jumped from 290 to 853. I'd be a more efficient killer if I wasn't such an obsessive hoarder. :D
---
what's your luck at?
---
Every legendary drops a rare Fasnacht mask instead of legendary gear.
---
ArenaNet pull off some neat pranks back in the days of the First Guild Wars game. The first year everyone had their character switch sex for the day.
---
Not anymore. Before demo expert got nerfed they were not bad. They‚Äôve been pushed just under the barely useable level. I have had an instigating, bloodied and still have my Bunker Buster. Btw the Buster‚Äôs bonus got broke awhile back so it is useless and doesn‚Äôt do more damage than a normal missile launcher now.
---
Anyway, missiles and launcher weapons in general are worthless now. Even if one does OK damage, the ammo costs just defeat them in the end.
---
If you use optimized bracers on both arms does it stack?
---
Um the first time a Gatling gun was used in combat was the civil war. Thats where the inspiration comes from. And doesn't make sense? If you're looking for an accurate representation of our timeline's history, you're playing the wrong game lol. Anyways have a good one
---
Don't forget that Nuclear Winter is a new game mode to go along with Adventure and Survival. It could be great, but yeah we have no clue what it is exactly.
---
Nothing different from any other mobile game but go off. I don't care anyway because I have no intention of playing it. And if I did, I would have no intention of buying anything.
---
BTW what about all that FREE content we're getting for the actual game in question, because this is about FO76 not Blades. Bethesda's so "money hungry" but all they've got is an in-game shop for cosmetics and all their major updates are free. SUCH GREED MUCH WOW.
---
IMO I've got my $60 worth already, and there's still so much more to come.
---
$180 wouldn't cover the cost of PC upgrades for motherboard, CPU, RAM and most importantly GPU (and most likely a PSU ugrade) to currently match a one X at 4K.
---
Unyeilding so normally 20-25
---
TL;DR stop whining 
---
Thanks I didnt know about the unstarred much love.
---
From the wiki.. 
---
"Invented by¬†Richard Gatling, it saw occasional use by the¬†Union¬†forces¬†during the¬†American Civil War¬†in the 1860s, which was the first time it was employed in combat" 
---
Im aloud to do whatever I please pussi boi 
---
Just saying. Even year old cigs taste like asshole/burn too hot. I feel like the stuff you find in FO is like the filters and some dirt lol.
---
I hope if I ever go to Boston there's a huge-ass ship up on a skyscraper somewhere or I'm going to be very dissapointed.
---
I would silver *this,* if I had coins. 
---
F
---
Yeah there are so many locations that even though I have discovered them, the locations are not ticked off for the challenge
---
Mothman make's sense I seen't it!
---
Considering how much they love paid mods I'm surprised they didn't do stuff like MapleStory2 UGC or Warframe Tennogen. Annoying not being able to use in-game earn-able currency for them though (and this isn't a F2P game) so I'd expect Atoms to stay as is.
---
I find the best overall combination of armor across all 3 stats is 2 pieces of t-51b (legs or arms) with the rest being x-01. Keeping all of your defensive stats over 400
---
Junk is randomized and also contains lots of stuff sold by other players, as junk is a major selling item for daily 1400 caps.  
---
I built a decent cave camp just the other day it's currently my favorite camp I've built it's not as nice as yours glad other people enjoy building camps as much as me
---
I love giving the newbies who float by my base a little care-package, I‚Äôm on the main road everyone passes when leaving the vault, and it‚Äôs nice to give people a good chance to start strong.
---
Sometimes they bring me gifts too, like an ivory grip mod, and it makes me happy.
---
Most of all, I just like playing the banjo as people come down to say hey.
---
I've seen several post demanding this exact same thing over the past few days. I just have to ask, but why do you feel the need to post this on the fallout 76 subreddit? 
---
I agree that there has been glaring flaws in the game since the launch, but why make a big post here demanding an apology on a subreddit made up of fans who enjoy the game? I would imagine the crowd at r/fallout would give you a better response.
---
Yea I‚Äôm curious of that myself. I personally hope that it might be some sort of arena type battle ground pvp. Capture the flag, king of the hill. I think a system of competitive matches like that would be awesome because I personally not much into the world pvp aspect. 
---
You win the ability to have your location marked on the map for everyone else to see.
---
Anyone know where to buy explosive shells recipe?
---
Sadly I have had more grief after the release than before, maybe just bad luck.
---
That all?
---
Wish there were varients cuz I like the Raider Leathers.
---
Honestly I mostly did it in a haste I‚Äôm honestly surprise people like this piece of shit game it‚Äôs baffling

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*

No not really, but if your clever you can use your position to lure people into traps and get some lute and caps
---
If people like you didn't go on this subreddit, wouldn't you be somewhere else making some better post?
---
First set yourself to pacifist in game settings. 2nd they just released survival mode which is full PvP. Stash is 800 pounds. Theres a vendor coming in May that you can trade legendary items too. No other details though. Ammo were stuck with but if you dont use it lose it. Missiles and nuke shells are heavy and will eat up your weight fast. So drop them. Also make sure to read your plans/recipes in your pipboy. Those can also add up over time. If you bulk junk items at a tinkers bench you can than sell them to vendors.
---
I went looking for bees there today and there weren't any.  Has anyone confirmed that the hives are still there since Fasnacht ended?
---
There's a crashed car with hives on it between New River Gorge Bridge - East and the Interstate 59 sign north of Sutton Station.
---
looks like the vertibirds that escort the nuclear keycard.
---
I would imagine I would love to play if I had not need to pay more money to play
---
I don't know what to tell you man
---
Outside Whitesprings golf club is a popular place to meet people leveling.
---
I have pulled 80 stim packs off of one corpse. Be careful man.
---
Does the mod still work? 
---
I am also interested. Not to buy... i just want to know if someone actually got those. 
---
Like I said I rarely go here I decided to come post on here since this is the game I‚Äôm talking about dum dum (please don‚Äôt get all salty like everyone else on this sub cause I called you a childish name it‚Äôs annoying) 
---
The rationale behind the hike was along the lines of it used to be a randomized item, and to have it 'easily' accessible meant those who had it could then sell it at less than store bought. Unfortunately that only helped the dupers get more cash in hand. Now there is not much variety in what's available, with the exception of travelling vendor bot, and very limited stock of X01 mods at Whitesprings bunker.
---
Every single thing that has come to the game since release is stuff that should have been in at release already.
---
And theres still tons of stuff that isnt inside, that should have been at release almost 6 months later.
---
So those "free major updates" are just stuff that they cut out of the release and now expect you to be thankful for.
---
&gt; IMO I've got my $60 worth already
---
Good for you. Me and many others havent.
---
Trade, trade, trade, and trade. My luck is as bad as yours, I don't have a single weapon or armor that I use, that hasn't been traded for or bought with caps I've made from trading.
---
Even if it's 500 at a time, I sell anything I think people might want. I also don't hold onto anything I don't personally want.
---
I made my two biggest transactions ever this week, and leveraged them into a new BP rifle, and the last two armor pieces I need.
---
I stopped trusting the RNGods a long time ago.
---
Yup, those are the escorts for the Keycard Cargobot.  You may have also seen the cargobot zipping around quickly.
---
Kill the veritbots, and take down the cargobot for some goodies and a keycard (used later in the game).
---
Ah weare just using then rn to kill super mutants
---
There's a few in the survival update topic.  But they haven't been as active as they had been previously
---
A bounty follows you even if you go back into adventure.
---
It‚Äôs a huge pain in the ass.  
---
You get swarmed when you have a 200 cap bounty in adventure mode.
---
Excuse me, but what exactly are seasons? It seems to be a hot topic on this subreddit lately but I have no clue to what it is.
---
I didn't know this until recently, but.
---
Take over the workshop at one of the power plants. Don't worry about actually repairing the plant. Build your own generator and power up the "Fusion core processor" at workshop with your generator. I owned the workshop for a few hours the other day amd ended up with about 15. I left it unlocked so idk how many it actually produced in that time. 
---
What does pacifist do? No damage dealt to me or by me? Good advice on the missiles and nukes, I definitely didn't realize that. I'm not a big gun character anyways. Just seems a shame to drop them. And I had no idea about bulking junk resources. I can finally get rid of my 3000+ steel. Thank you!
---
Maybe he is here for the negative reaction, like a troll.
---
Ya, enemies will attack them too, and they will retaliate against anyone that attacks.
---
They are kind of harmless to players though.  Their attacks don't do much damage.
---
Lmao this guy 
---
Yeah my friend shot it and he said it wasn't hurting him
---
It's also great as a 100+ level to see 8 friggin events on the left side of the map, and **0** ever on the right.
---
Give me consistent 50+ events already
---
Ikr what a cuckold 
---
I'm higher level, but I've barely explored anywhere. I'm down to help level up. GT is Kaise7en
---
Gotchya, thanks a bunch 
---
Capture a workshop with a vertibird landing, repair the vertibird and pick up a grenade from the box beside the spot. throw a grenade/flare and one will go and attack enemies for you.
---
Why are you so mad op? 
---
I was in game with someone with the Old Man Winter mask 
---
That would be awesome , especially if you could select a name for it from a preset list of names like Fallout4 cc pets,,, that makes it very personal for alot of people.
---
I liked the Huskey &amp; Grace from far Harbour - 
---
Wich is another thing they could add - a walking Merchant like Grahm selling Tamed pets or quest maps to find pets that once consumed add a quest marker.
---
I also think "Feeding a Pet" could be a thing - like give your pet a 24/48hr food bonus and xp / level up, if you've fed it - different foods give different bonuses &amp; pets have foods they like and dislike, carnivores &amp; Herbivores.
---
It all adds gameplay value to the game and they make a few dollars from Atoms while also attracting new players to their improved game - its a Win Win for everybody in F76 :)
---
Todd Howard should give all players all the rare masks on April 1st, then delete them on the 2nd.
---
anything
---
Honestly it‚Äôs mostly based on how we all know Bethesda can make something amazing and they seem to just not give a shit anymore imo
---
Mr fuzzy Paddle Ball.
---
Give examples bud 
---
I‚Äôll wait 
---
If you have those things then you shouldn‚Äôt be getting one shotted by a tse plain and simple. 
---
I have full sentinel assassin and all the best defensive perks, most guys with tse‚Äôs don‚Äôt dmg me and if they do it‚Äôs because of other factors like perks or fire rate, not because the weapon is a tse.
---
Good luck.  I'd be surprised if 1 copy of each of them actually existed in the game, let alone all on a single platform, and on top of that, duplicates that someone would be willing to trade away.
---
People who are like you post on this subreddit almost every day.  Also I don‚Äôt think that poster is in the minority at all, a lot of people enjoy the game and are excited to see what comes with it. Everyone agrees it had a rocky launch, but the game has become much much better since then. 
---
Examples on how this has been a shitty game? If I really have to give examples and you don‚Äôt know that worry‚Äôs me lmao
---
Yeah bud explain why your mad other than ‚Äúthey could do better‚Äù you could do better and post a better point 
---
Yeah there is so much they could do..... and it would add a different level of complexity and management to the game - especially the need to feed your virtual pets.
---
Exotic pets might sound awesome, but when you deathclaw will only eat the fresh flesh of a super mutant, then it becomes a totally different situation.
---
Fail to meet their needs, and that pet might leave in search of food.... or just eat Bessie the cow
---
For someone with the raiders tag, you‚Äôre a pretty soft little bitch aren‚Äôt you. 
---
16x the detail!
---
Idk, I couldn't get it to work
---
I literally already said why I was mad in the post again if you can‚Äôt see that it‚Äôs extremely worrying that you‚Äôre this dumb lol
---
Every time there's a new update some pretentious streamer gets a stick up their butt and all their little minions come in here regurgitating the same talking points. They're just jealous because we're having fun and they're miserable little jackanapes.
---
It's actually a common trick. Plants need repair? Scrap and replant. Base totally wrecked? Move camp a couple of inches and place everything back down, good as new.
---
Lmao buddy I‚Äôm asking for more reasons you Dunder head, I hope you‚Äôre able to have a good day op 
---
I had a similar idea but haven't gotten around to it yet! You've done a brilliant job here.
---
Can you clarify what you mean by not working?
---
Well spotted, this would explain a lot.
---
That‚Äôs what I do and go with no caps and no aid 
---
There really doesn‚Äôt need to be anymore reasons then the fact that they could‚Äôve made this game amazing but decided to settle for a piece of shit lol stay angry papaüòÇ
---
They're like that by default. I've been scrapping them for the auto plans. 
---
But my 800 nuka quantums spark joy for me 
---
Well people say that the explosive effect negates the anti armor effect
---
Nope, it's broken, latest patches did it and they haven't updated it yet.
---
Oh sure tell everyone how good it is so next time i go farming the raider market all I can find is pipe pistols...
---
I use this trick in survival mode. Usually stalk my prey, engage, then leave via blackout. Its lovely.
---
You‚Äôre a classy guy op 
---
Were you on xbox?
---
Wait. Human NPC‚Äôs in the game?!?!?
---
Welp, now I‚Äôm so excited that I have lost the ability to sleep on my stomach. 
---
it's 1400 and the Civil War tophat
---
Again, you could make that argument for any game with DLC.
---
Besides, before the game came out and had a "bad release" they had already said they would regularly release new, free content so it's not like this is something they decided after the fact. Goes back to my point of some people never being happy, because if they did release the game with "all that stuff already in" then you'd just be complaining there's no new content instead.
---
Maybe move your camp so it's not next to a SB spawn ? I mean, even once they're easy to kill, they're still generally not worth the ammo, and i say this as someone who regularly drops them in very few rounds. 
---
I think the icon is pic of gat plasma
---
And the caps come out of the offender in adventure mode while in survival the person that puts the bounty loses the caps not the offender
---
I don‚Äôt believe either.  I wear armor in my PA and most of the drops are either melee or crap armor.
---
the reward isnt even worth grinding for atm.
---
A m79 is average at best and even with instigating still sucks.
---
1 shot slow reload no good for anything. Bethesda needs to not do a Destiny and reward weapons that are garbage for doing such a grindy quest/challenge.
---
will hold for about 10 min
---
Yap
---
Alright, so on this server I've been on a good number of hours, there are 8 in their holding pattern near Point Pleasant, and I just left Top of the World where one was flying over with its escort of 3 Vertibots, so at least 9 in total (assuming no other drops or envoys are in progress).
---
During my time here there have been 2 nukes, but overall it's been a slow server (in terms of performance). Killing stuff doesn't lag, but interactions with containers are quite laggy, specifically "searching" for extra contents. Also, while that envoy was over Top of the World, my long-range shots on a Mole Miner had the lot-of-health initial impact, with the much-less-removed update, but that was the first time experiencing it today. Oh also of note, about 45mins prior to that I installed the Signal Repeater at the NIRA dish, powered it up, and the quest glitched on the checkpoint, so it hasn't given me the next step.
---
About to go signal some drops now to see if anymore show up in the holding pattern after. Will update my post, accordingly.
---
Too soon
---
relog
---
Well, you don't have to DROP them, I tend to wait between getting mini nukes and getting a fatman launcher. Then go into overkill mode using a nuke on mobs rather than taking them out one by one. Note, don't do this indoors, ok?
---
Thanks whore that‚Äôs means a lot coming from you! 
---
Roadkill 
---
Hehe that would be fun, too spice it up, your Deathclaw likes an Aged Queen Mirelurk Steak on Sundays :)
---
Nope, people like you are actually the minority ones, I don't know why you even waste time with the game or in this subreddit... Me I'm enjoying the game so far, sure it has some flaws and there's still some features that are really needed, but looking at the roadmap, by the end of the year, the game will be much better.
---
Good luck wasting your time on a shitty game lmao
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkblLhs0-4
---
You sound like a jealous woman bruh lol 
---
That sounds great 
---
Just keep the good vibes going by helping lowbies when you get high.  
---
According to the mod page on nexus, hasn't worked since February 19th patch 
---
Tameable deathclaw? I didn‚Äôt know you could tame them, do they become a pet or something???
---
The only thing broken that is the Damaged hazmat suit.
---
I don't really want it for normal legendaries.... but I think all "named" legendaries. All Rise, Perfect Storm, etc... should be creditable once you get them like all the mysteries items are. You have to use the item as a component in the upgrade... but it's otherwise upgradeable. 
---
They should make a bell too, so when you ring it the person gets a notification that someone is at their camp.
---
The post says ‚ÄúStatistical Breakdown‚Äù in the title.
---
Can we have the statistical breakdown please. 
---
Seasons sound interesting to me, but I don't have the time I used to. Back in the Diablo 2 days, seasons were fine, because I was a child with no life. I'm going to be salty as hell if my characters I have specifically made for PVP mode become unusable in PvP mode. That would mean months of wasted work. 
---
Sad man.
---
yes you tame them and they stay at your camp 
---
you need lvl 3 of animal friend and need to be over lvl 21 in this case
---
Noted. But maybe just once, you know for science
---
Lol hopefully the rng god can send some blessings your way
---
Yes very broken, sell me it please for 10 caps.
---
People are so tired of these fake outrage posts.
---
Get over your entitled spoiled views.
---
LolüòÇ try 15k
---
Of course 
---
I set up my camp on the top right of the map, every now and then those vertibots will fly past, most of the time they‚Äôre accompanying the flying delivery bots
---
And area text chat...
---
I'm not saying whether I agree or disagree with you, but I must ask. Do you know what it takes, and the kind of time investment it requires to design an entirely new engine from scratch?
---
I could trade 50 for 300 cloth which all you have to do is go around collecting for free
---
I like the deathclaw gauntlet or the super sledge
---
Um are you stupid? My opinion is entitled and spoiled? Lmao their are so many fanboys who will suck Bethesda off till the day they die 
---
Awesome thanks for the heads up manüëçüëç
---
You get it from an early responders quest. It isnt worth much.
---
Seasons would be Hardcore seasons where ur forced to start a new character, bring it into a fresh world/season. where everyone starts off on a level playing field.  And not like the current survival mode where people farmed up whole sets of weapons and armor 3 stars just to bang on people without it.
---
Yes. They are. Just because they are opinions doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt also be a that.
---
So I guess we know who the stupid one is. The person going around demanding apologizes.
---
People like you. Ugh. 
---
They should make pets the same as companions from previous games - they can be injured in battle, but only down to 1 hp. If they hit 1 hp, they are out of action until combat ends or you give them a stimpak. That way they can remain in your camp while its being destroyed, but not die. 
---
Oh alright I just saw if under a rare outfits compilation
---
&gt;They stated they read reddit a lot so make a list guys of things they  need to change and who knows. They might actually read it and do it 
---
you mean like they have been?  for literally the last 3 months, almost every change/fix/patch seems to be a direct response to the community.
---
Got any vanguard heavy metal pieces?
---
human npc is coming in  wastelanders. Todd said it was suppose to change the game drastically. 
---
I never said it would be easy to make one but you really shouldn‚Äôt use the same engine for 20 years that‚Äôs just fucking stupid I‚Äôm sure we can both agree you shouldn‚Äôt use an engine for so long when it needs constant improvement and checking let‚Äôs be real here
---
Thanks had logged for the evening back on to get that though almost bought a few times
---
ok last call
---
I have literally never heard anyone complain that good and finished game does not have free stuff added in later.
---
&gt; you could make that argument for any game with DLC
---
Not true. Witcher 3 was a completeproduct and loved by everybody when it was released. No one complained when there were DLCs that were a fair addition to the game. Instead those were loved and praised because they were just as the standart game great and finished products.
---
Like when expansion packs were a thing. Fallout 76 and bethesdas course are the exact opposite. They release unfinished products with a triple A price tag and a microtransaction ingame store and then expect you to be thankfull for maybe and only maybe fixing the stuff years later if they feel like.
---
Personally i've never heard that, and they appear to work fine on my guns. i'm guessing you're getting it confused with AA not working with energy weapons. Which, despite them dropping with said prefix, it does not. 
---
Ever heard of red dead online?
---
I have an extra that you can have if you're on PC, if you haven't gotten it yet.
---
Man you are literally mental if you think I‚Äôm entitled for having an opinionüòÇ stay salty my friend. Ugh. 
---
I no longer even pick them up when they drop to sell them. Much easier selling costumes, which weigh a fraction of the missile launcher.
---
Apologies another reply,, but your idea gave me a Eureka moment - 
---
Long term hidden food combinations could lead to a skin change / spcies evolution - so after feeding your Deathclaw for 2 weeks depending on your feed and pets food tastes,, your pet becomes a Red chameleon Deathclaw or a Vicious Pink Deathclaw ...
---
Maybe thats too much i don't know,, i felt i had to write it anyway incase Todd Howard is reading lolz :)
---
This. My generator is in a raised tiny shed but ghouls, wolves, etc. Some how get inside sometimes. There's not enough room to fit next to it but that doesn't stop them.
---
I‚Äôm honestly kind of baffled you would come on the FO76 sub and bash a game that a lot of people throughly enjoy. It‚Äôs quite remarkable to be honest. Also I frequent the fallout sub as well and couldn‚Äôt help but notice you heeded someone‚Äôs advice and posted this exact same thing there as well. 
---
Also sentinel assasin's very broken, I will buy that cheap too.
---
What about shareable blueprints? When you create a blueprint you should get the option to turn it into a note, players could then trade the notes like any other item. When you read the note it will add the blueprint to your blueprint section but can not be built until you either have all the required items in your stored tab or have enough materials to build everything. If the blueprint has atomic shop items it can still be traded but not placeable until the player has purchased the required atomic shop items 
---
Yeah I took someone‚Äôs advice and decided to get second opinions lol is that wrong? 
---
Actually its the gatling laser from Fallout 3. 
---
Get the fuck off reddit you cry baby 
---
What is your build strength. Probably should find something that fits that. 
---
look through your junk tab, things that get used the least will have large stacks, start pairing those down
---
Okay lol my bad! Then you sound like a sad man instead of a jealous woman! 
---
You on PS4? Come find me and stop talking. 
---
13 str, idk what tho...
---
I'm on ps4 but the offer is greatly appreciated!
---
I have two mules on my fiancee's account sense he quit playing both are full to the max with legendarys
---
Go through the ash heap and kill mole miners and scrap their stuff. They‚Äôre full of black titanium. 
---
Yes i agree it separate both. lets those lower level guys take a breath.
---
But so fun when you have enough ammo.  I haven't used mine since the repair patch.  Apparently they'll last more than 3 12 round vollies now.
---
who said anything about Wendigos being human?
---
Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold.
---
Bethesda reads these posts? \*faint glimmer of hope appears in eyes\*
---
Thank youuuu!
---
Witcher 3 is not an online game. They have to keep releasing new stuff for FO76 to keep it fresh. They're patching and/or adding it to it weekly, so I don't see what the problem is.
---
You can argue "they should have done this" all you want but the fact is what Bethesda is doing *right now* is all that matters at this point. 
---
I think it was written in to give them a possible source for future DLC content. "Physch, none of it was real, start a new character to play the new DLC."
---
Could be a fun in for a new, not shitty survival. Or a mode with NPC's. Or... setup for Fallout 5. What if Eeeeverything was a sim from as far back as the first game in the franchise?
---
I say possible, because there are a hundred other "in's" that have been written into the canon, that have never gone anywhere. Like all the Moon-War stuff thats in Fo4. Or the alien city in the Mojve, also from Fo4. Or the San Fransisco stuff from Kellog's head... also from 4. You get the idea. 
---
We meet our first Synth who references the Institute in Fo3 (yep, 3). So thats proof enough that they lay eggs that can eventually hatch!
---
I'm down for any of it coming true, personally.
---
same, i really think this game can pull a eso or nms. i hope anthem can bring itself from the ground because there are MANY things wrong with anthem atm.
---
I never said it was wrong, just thought it was funny you did it almost immediately when people didn‚Äôt agree with you on here. Ohhh and btw I can see storms from across the map especially if I‚Äôm on a high hill top. 
---
Well that's only strength. That isn't a complete build. You could turn that into heavy gunner, shotgunner, or melee but I'd highly suggest going to 15 on strength for melee. 
---
Playstation is for children, like you. Get a PC and come find me. Bitch.
---
Unstarred legendaries?  What are you referring to?
---
I‚Äôm sick of people ranting about the ‚Äú20 year old engine‚Äù you do realize that if you compare the engine they used for 4 and 76 to the one for Oblivion it would be drastically different right? They update it with new tech and new software as they make bigger and better games. It‚Äôs like when a new game comes out and you have to install new processors and add more RAM to your pc. Sure it‚Äôs still the same computer but now it‚Äôs more powerful and efficient. And over time you‚Äôre probably end up replacing every component until theirs nothing original left but the casing. So sure it‚Äôs still the same engine but it‚Äôs also not the same at all
---
Tl/Dr :same same, no solution found 
---
There's one guy I play with that had this happen all the time.  We would have to all go to area talk in order to hear him, and then someone else wouldn't be able to hear.  We are not noobs and tried all kinds of troubleshooting.  It was just fucked.   
---
They need to fix survival mode I‚Äôm pissed I done lost all my caps and meds because dude killed me took all my caps and I had to spawn at the vault which fucked me over cuz of spawn camping motherfuckers mind my language but I just hopped off and I‚Äôm gonna delete fallout cuz now I don‚Äôt even have caps for the regular game mode
---
Same as my tag here lol. 
---
Sadly sentinel armor and assasisns make it rough for us melee and bloodied melee..find myself using my rifle way more than I ever do in pvp
---
My only issue with West tek is when i bathe in toxic goo for hours i still come out of it not so super.
---
I‚Äôm planning on upping to 14, and that‚Äôs my max, i just don‚Äôt like how inconsistent shotguns are, that‚Äôs why i switched to melee build.
---
I meant what is your build strong at. Not your actual strength number. Sorry for the confusion. 
---
Yeah you can now 5 months after release lol and yeah I like second opinions. Also I expected hate I didn‚Äôt run away trying to get people to agree lmao 
---
Can that mod be for for any other armor ? 
---
I can come put it out of its misery. Poor lil level 21 won't last in Appalachia on its own. 
---
Yeah, I had this happen earlier in the week. I left the server and joined a new world. I didnt check my inventory again though...
---
I love it when people have no idea what there talking about
---
Ah no prob. I need to spec myself out, I am trying to develop a melee build tho.
---
Sorry Holmes...can‚Äôt deal with the .ini file and the lag and the crashing and the blue screen and all that. I don‚Äôt need my gaming machine to also be my porn machine. Bitch. 
---
You are cancelled. Go cry somewhere else you disgusting little shit stain. Until you come find me and kill me, you can eat a big ‚Äòol bag of dicks, bubba 
---
Heavy gunner runs off of strength too. Then you can get high dps and always switch out cards to melee when gathering ammo. 
---
Damn it. The last time I was in PvP, I was sniping from outside of vats range (180, and 204) and kept getting chased down immediately after firing a **silenced** shot from stealth. It was enough of a problem that I haven't been back in since. 
---
This would completely explain the problems I was having. The damage nerf was bad enough, now they've screwed our defenses as well.
---
Thanks just needed confirmation 
---
Is that why there are similar bugs and glitches across all of there games? Lol some people 
---
True, but I don‚Äôt like power armor and it seems heavy guns sort of depend on it.
---
Watoga BOS vendor sells most PA mods or plans 
---
I picked up my T60 reactive plates there.  It‚Äôs a beautiful thing when some ‚Äúslappy‚Äù tries to mess with you and they get reverse ganked. 
---
Nice to know this community downvotes people finding bugs
---
I can fully endorse that. FO4 settlements required a fair number of turrets to cover all approaches, and even then they would actually engage enemies autonomously. It is frustrating that so many things about the building system were limited and nerfed, so many parts removed, and the overall building experience weakened. Even a 2x2 shack in FO4 would get 4 turrets on my builds, so a large structure needs to have more than that IMO.
---
I always have a look to compare it to mine haha I've seen some great camps though.
---
Good job man.
---
Waste more time, with more internet shit talking paragraphs. 
---
Many of the PvP players have been doing PvP since BETA and have the gear and techniques down pat. Keep playing and getting better, you'll be killing soon enough. 
---
sent!!
---
ThereGoesMyHero.mp3
---
I‚Äôll do it in your honor then!
---
That reminds me I need more Cheesy Puffs
---
Not really. Theres only 1 cards that you get benefits from power armor with heavy guns. But if you want melee then just depends on the weapon you want to use. Dont underestimate the little combat knives. They can be wicked. 
---
Mine is semi, the auto murdered 5.56 rounds and the prime auto murdered my stash box lol
---
You -can- do a vats crit build with a decent harpoon gun, I mean, for Atom's sake don't, but it's doable. With a plasma gat ? No way. 
---
They could be considering the short barrels as bull barrels, thicker and more accurate that a standard short barrel
---
A combat knife got me all the way to level 40, i know what you mean.
---
There is something primal deep down in all of us, that enjoys the big ol' boom, fireballs, and watching enemies ragdoll off  trees, houses, bridges before you pick them clean of useful stuff.
---
I agree with all of this. The idea of it being set in a smaller state Is awesome. I wasn‚Äôt interested in 76s lore because its just notes and robots.  It can be single player but multiplayer is optional. 
---
There really is. When I see a satisfying ragdoll I'm not even mad that I'll never find the body again
---
Probably busy. They were at Bethesda game days this past week.
---
https://youtu.be/rfyViQ9Uo_M
---
Sounds like you might need some perk card tweaks. D0 you have stagger?
---
I have that on my weapon right now lol 
---
They need to be buffed thats for sure
---
Can you tell me what phone number you used?
---
Peasants in the middle ages might have used scythes, but that's a result of not having a weapon.
---
A piece of wood with a funny blade was better than their hands and not much else.
---
Um, I'm a ninja and most players don't even see me. I sneak up on them so close I'm offered the join team/trade options. I hit them 3x before they even respond and it's like I'm hitting them with a pillow.
---
The should give everyone a free Harlequin masks for making us feel like fools running the helvetia parade over a hundred times.  But I would take a t-shirt that said " I did Faschnacht and all I got was this lousy T-shirt" instead. love you bethesda
---
Both the in-game and real-world lore suggest that Wendigos were once humans who were transformed by ‚Äòhunger.‚Äô
---
Ahhhhhhh I see. Sounds pretty interesting. I may try out survival if that's the case. Thank you!
---
There is also the [war scythe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_scythe) to consider, though very different from the farming implement.
---
"Um", read my post again.  It still applies. 
---
Man...I was so excited for Anthem. The gameplay is fun but that's almost the only good thing I can say about it. It was such a let down and I hope they can get it to a place it deserves because I would love to play that game.
---
I don‚Äôt care as long as they keep the ¬´scrap all junk¬ª at workbenches and the multi-star legendary system. Such great additions. 
---
I love it. Free hunting cap for squatchin this week. 
---
You could see them when the game was released, I play on PS4 and could see storms from across the map from day 1 so honestly I have no clue what you are even talking about. 
---
Enjoy your day and don‚Äôt let a game ruin your good time.
---
just don't go in there full of caps and aid your first time.
---
I think we all get the the point, would the word be ‚Äòverbose‚Äô üëÄ
---
Love all your furniture and decor!
---
You started it chump. Must have been some lag in your anime buttfucking program.
---
No one forced you to come here and Talk shit. You did that of your own accord. 
---
Take responsibility for your actions, bruh
---
Anyone wanna trade a 3* semi handmade for a piece of cavalier Assassins?
---
Not to mention the little antenna arrays up front. 
---
What system do you play on? I have met so many wonderful people on this game. Only problem is that my list keeps dwindling. 
---
Gonna hold off on my next game purchase still. I'm not done yet :)
---
You called?
---
Great job! My PSN name is awesomeness64 (made it when I was in sixth grade lol), I'm gonna send you a request if you're up for it! :)
---
During last 3h I lost over 6000 for one single griefer who kept following me. No matter where I spawned, suddenly he was there. once  he spawned into my camp right begind me which was super super super weird. Like it shouldn't be possible but i guess you can get some perk card for that or something when you are high enough :/ First it was like "that's the name of the game" but after like 20th time he killed me with one hit it started becoming frustrating. Spawn &gt; screen is still black &gt; die by same player &gt; spawn into my camp &gt; screen fades out of black &gt; run inside my house and lock door &gt; go to work bench &gt; one hit killed by same damn player &gt; can't spawn into camp because for some reason there is no marker &gt; spawn into closest railway station and run 15min to my camp &gt; pretty much everything is destroyed and I have no junk to fix anything &gt; suddenly killed by same player &gt; getting annoyed and trying to fight back despite him being lvl 350 when I'm just 80 &gt; keep spawning into vault 76 over and over again but die every time before I can even move, just like few other players around me &gt; try to spawn into watoga &gt; not enough caps... neither any healing items. FML

[removed]
---
Your assuming things, He said the game would change drastically but he never said human npcs.
---
Ummmm.... Did.... did you? 
---
Same here except someone else built it for me like a month ago and so I can't place it or scrap
---
And now I‚Äôm scheduling a day off of work for it. 
---
Yeah, it's great until you get called out for singing along.   Who want to team up with someone humming along??
---
Randomize the adventure/survival switch at the beginning.
---
I like to loot them when paired with launchers in a firefight. Fire off a few indiscriminately, then immediacy drop the launcher
---
"You cannot fast travel when enimies are nearby" - Game
---
*opens a bottle of Nukashine and hides for 3 minutes* - player
---
naw
---
It's great! 
---
There's two types of legendary enemies in 76: Starred and unstarred.
---
The unstarred are very common. They'll have names like 'Legendary Scorched Conqueror' or 'Legendary Watoga Protectron' or  'Legendary Charred Ghoul'. You'll see these guys especially when the game makes a bunch of mobs all at once in one place like in Watoga or Harper's Ferry or the Whitespring Clubhouse. Functionally they'll be no different from other legendaries and they'll drop 1\* legendary gear (or a drill or a syringer. Don't get me started.) It's these guys that _don't_ count for the weekly challenge.
---
But then occasionally, especially during events, you'll get a green glowing enemy that'll have a name like 'Legendary Supermutant Overlord \*\*' or 'Legendary Glowing Mole Miner\*\*\*' and these guys a.) count toward the weekly challenge and b.) drop the good shit (or at least have a chance to.)
---
If you want to see the difference, walk around Watoga a couple of times. There's a ton of protectrons there and new ones generate all the time. They'll be at least a couple unstarred legendaries, especially by the Super Duper Mart. Kill it and watch it not count. Then do an event like Uranium Fever and when the game announces there's a disgruntled former worker that's when you see a green glowing 3\* mole miner. Kill it and then watch it count.
---
You do realize you're not actually your player character right? The bombs haven't fallen, you can quit being a cunt anytime you like.
---
true but the description of wastelanders said  true choices and consequence and i don't know how you can do that without npcs. it can be doing a eso were the stories are connected with dlc 
---
So funny story I had with Red Dead 2 I encountered the same bird people problem that was in the first game...does that mean that Rockstar needs to fix their engine?
---
Also almost every game you enjoy uses some old engine in some way shape or form the only reason why it runs well is because they add on different parts to work for their game.
---
Oh my God just SHUT UP AND STOP PLAYING IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A WHINY BITCH DAMN
---
You forgot the part where you use a Stealh boy to sneak in and drop a paper bag full of bones and spices in the middle of their home. 
---
That would be awesome! 
---
People are definitely allowed in without a helmet - it would be too hard to kick back and relax with it on! 
---
I've had it worse. All you see in the following screen could not be removed :

---
It's a picture from fallout shelter of the fallout 3 Gatling laser bring sold in fallout 76 where it resembles no gun.
---
If you liked their other games then they have nothing to apologize for just because one was a fuck up. Move on with your life, maybe stop thinking any corporation is your friend and maybe you'll stop crying yourself to sleep at night when they eventually prove that no... They aren't.
---
Ah, we complain when the game isn't true to life, but when they make the DMV painfully accurate... That sucks, too apparently.  
---
I just kept opening stuff, going to terminals, standing in different places. Something finally worked. I couldn't tell you what because I was so frustrated.  But persevere, dude, and feel good about making it through a stupidly accurate moment in the game. 
---
How do you make it so there's no wires/generators inside?
---
I did a reroll 1&gt; 50 in 3 days in adventure mode.
---
No, 20% bonus is very low
---
I don‚Äôt think racism would be a thing as all minorities would be killed pretty much right away.
---
Oh yeah, that's pretty obvious. I was honestly shocked to see so many post complaining about that, but I still appreciate the advice üëå
---
I've liked this game since day 1. I could say I'm sorry you don't, but this sounds like you don't even want to try to get into it. If you dont that's fine too, but there is no reason to just come here trying to troll ppl. Just leave a little constructive feed back on how Bethesda could do better and move on man. All this angst isnt worth your time.
---
If I have workshops, when I'm about to logoff I try to team up with a lost level to give them away fully functioning.  
---
I run a pure explosive build. Missiles are my best friend along with all things in this game that blow things into tiny bits. 
---
But seriously I have a quad 2 shot missile launcher and it's a monster of a gun only if you have max demo expert which is the only bad thing about them in my opinion. Also the bear arms and whatever the explosive weight one as well is must haves as well.
---
Ps4
---
They really should drop the weight to like 1, so they're at least viable to carry with one other weapon and ammo
---
"you wanna pvp i'll give you pvp"
---
Now I think your also stupid and worse
---
Probably the full blood moon that brought out the griefers to try there luck in survival, but couldn‚Äôt cut it?  Maybe?  So they came and said hi....
---
I my instance it was bethesda.gear for you it is a different number.
---
One of my characters is a heavy gunner.  Even with all the heavy gun and explosive perks, my legendary missile launcher is not great.  I use one with a targeting computer because it's fun sometimes but if I really need to kill something I pull out my explosive .50 cal.
---
I like onions.
---
i think they can improve on the Stimpack part. 
---
If they make it more involved and a little bit more time consuming , feeding / breeding. then it seperates dedicated pet lovers from people that really don't bother with pets and you will as a pet handler have more pride in looking after and leveling up your pet as you will have an impressive pet to show for it..
---
If its as easy as a Stimpack nobody will really care if they're pet dies and everybody will have one as its easy to mantiain... 
---
Its like Seeing every player with generic pets Vs Seeing occasional players with impressive pets they've nurtured and maintained. 
---
I think what you say would work best if we took those Pets out travelling with us and it was downed in combat - too many wounds or no Stims the pet could return to camp and require rest for 2hrs in a Pet Bed.
---
Onions are tasty
---
9.9/10 I usually keep everything unlocked amd log off so people can have free resources
---
I honestly can't contribute much to wether the spawns have changed, so sorry about not being helpful with that. BUT if you're hard up for lead might I recommend Lucky Hole Mine? Go in with Excavator PA on and you'll come out with enough lead ore to produce like 800 lead scrap. And it's tied for iron ore as the easiest and most acid efficient smelting, 1 acid + 2 ore = 5 scrap.
---
So if you only need a portion of that it'll only take you a few minutes, and you can get the whole score in like 10-15 mins, maybe 20 while you're still getting familiar with the layout. Much quicker than server hopping for several hours üëç
---
Hahahaahaha i could see that blowing their minds. I freak a lot of people out when even i start hangin with them for a while. I have a list of "life time subscription members" i have deals with them yjry get me the junk and the extra junk i build whatever i can for them be modded or basic. I build a bunch of random noobs random gear if they talk or spend time with me at all. 
---
That‚Äôs a weird story....  
---
^
---
Its not just you. I have had more fun since Bethesda gave the people who ruined the game their own server. 
---
I wish you luck!
---
Its alk exactly the same in both modes
---
I took five workshops and did eight events and then I was hunted down by three guys in rags and top hats.
---
Ah, Devil's Backbone. Gorgeous place. Had my camp there until I got tired of Super Mutants sniping my crops 1km away like a Canadian sniper.
---
i think thats part of the nuka cola t51 paint quest
---
That‚Äôs a good way of looking at it
---
r/Market76
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
This is great! Thanks for sharing all the work you‚Äôve done. 
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking plus it‚Äôs called wastelanders which is a big giveaway.
---
This is how we roll in Marsupials Herd.
---
Founded by all those showing up near the low level new player to drop off supplies, often from the high and strage jump you just didn't see comin
---
Do you have an opinion on which headlamp might be the most stealthy? Probably just the stock one?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any but lots of copper veins by Charleston station
---
Didnt Bethesda say that they are never allowing mods in fo76?
---
Wait what? Reactive plates also reflect ranged damage? You sure? I always thought it was melee only.
---
I think I'm at like 63? But the number was frozen waaay lower no matter what I learned until I started my second character, and now it's finally counting some of them. So I honestly don't know, but I'd wager it's a bit buggy lol
---
its not for me ;-;
---
Definitely the most entertaining one I‚Äôve seen. The creepiest one is the random circle of mannequins that spawn
---
thats all of our hope that bethesda can implement a karma system and a system that promotes popular/cool creations in such a way that we the players can impact each other in long reaching ways with out choices.
---
keep doing what you are doing and lets show them that is how we wanna play this game with the fellow vault ppl
---
They replied to one of my posts only 2 days ago.
---
Sent you a request and will come check it out! 
---
Just to clarify .. I'd be totally happy if they did implement it as simply stimpacks - however i think it would be a missed opportunity if Bethesda didn't innovate and expand on the Taming System. :)
---
Apologies for the long reply :)

Yeah! You get to be a huge target for everyone else on the server....

Blackwater mine is my go to for this. Mole miner suit scrap has a single unit of black Titanium in them. Get lucky and hit Uranium Fever and come out with dozens of them.

Honestly I 100% expect the Moon War to come up the next time around, just like I 100% expect the Aldmeri Dominion to be more relevant in the next Elder Scrolls. They're just hooks too good to pass up using.
---
Could be in game choices lock you to a server mode with others who have made the same choices and changed that game world, sort of like instancing.   Could be many things, none of which involve human npcs.  Its a possibility that human npcs are introduced but I wouldn't be posting that human npcs are coming like it was something that was officially stated.  None of us really know squat about whether or not anything is coming of substance or if its just more marketing hype.

Just crouch. You are invisible on the map. I always crouch as much as I can at my camp. Haven't had any griefers stop by yet.
---
Oof, that's no bueno. Well, that really sucks for me I guess. Hopefully someone on this forum has an answer but I've quite literally tried everything and it's getting a little hopeless. Thanks for that piece of insight, tho! Nice to know I'm not alone in this, at least.

Foundation stacking was removed.

the CAMP device and the PIP boy are our navigational tools within a simulated dimension, it has to do with dimensional travel, not strict consciousness binding to machine / digital. The clock starts over on Oct 23 every single time, continuous "consciousness" in connection to a server allows the device to progress but then resets after a break in this continuity.

I know it's not anytime soon. But usually after sales taper off and they want a little more cash. Sometime before GOTY versions come out.

Agreed. Making several blueprints that are hard to fit together for favourite workshops is such a pain. Yes you can snap em into place using the resource collectors, but there's always some weird wiring issue or an incomplete wall because the blueprint budget can't hold very much.
---
Full workshop blueprints would be **amazing!**
---
When are you usually on?
---
I was wondering if it was that or the Quantum one. I found the last nuka cola key in the world long before I even knew about the quest, so I just walked up and unlocked the door.
---
I noticed that we gain more caps and more xp if we bring back minimum 2 data.
---
We also win more often 3 rewards (outfit or painting).
---
I had 1 painting a day since I bring 2 minimum data.
---
Now, I finally finished.

Make sure to get rid of missiles when you don't use them. Had about 50 pounds of missiles in my stash and sold them to someone. Also watch the mini nukes but i keep them because they are useful.

This is wrong. This last patch nerfed melee really hard. It‚Äôs bs

Melee was nerfed hard last patch

I‚Äôll trade you a TSE 10mm smg for the handmade?

Max level of course lvl50

I don't think it's for either of those.

Those gatlings needed four-man crews to work. Not mobile crank guns. I don't want an accurate representation of the timeline, i want an accurate representation of what Bethesda thinks the gatling looks like and what it actually is, smart ass.

got the ol gangs of new york treatment eh

Have you tried restarting? I just checked and it says that it's free for the next 22 hours.

I got a fat man the other day and instantly killed myself when a mirelurk hunter almost twice my level jumped me on low health... I'm a bad settler lol

I‚Äôm on PS4, I‚Äôd be willing to do something like this. Hit me up if you want to.
---
Haters didn't "fail" at anything. The game deserved the hate it got at launch. It was a buggy mess.
---
Bethesda succeeded at patching many of the bugs out. The game is much better today than it was then.
---
I do but that‚Äôs because I was already using the card that makes explosives weigh less and I found a bloodied misslelauncher
---
 And that behavior would get someone stomped into the floor on survival. It seems the bullies didn't Just jump over to survival 
---
Ahhh yes.  That piece.  I hear tell this goes for about 5-7k.  What‚Äôs your offer?  
---
It's defintely changed,  but I'm still getting kills with my gauntlet, not as easily as before maybe, but that's where not being a one-trick pony comes in. So, yes, my post still applies. 
---
Reminds me of [Ten Speed](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b0b448c534a56dc365da9c/t/5a8f43598165f52d85a0f9e1/1519338343123/?format=1500w) from the Amory Wars. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry dude, I‚Äôm a shotty build no use for that!  
---
I also see no currently free hats in the atom shop...
---
That's why I said *inspiration*, but it was exactly that - a mobile crank gun. Just not a handheld crank gun, which is what I think you're trying to say. Moreover maybe it's an image to cover the gatling category. A image to denote gatlings; the civil war type and the laser type, not an image of one specific gun. Which doesn't seem to be in your capacity to realise, as you only want what you want, dumbass. :)
---
What outfit are you wearing?
---
How many caps for it?
---
I just really want that Hunter's Long Coat. It's become so annoying for me, I'm ready to level any camp near that area I see. I have to resist an actual urge to at this point.
---
 Right now top offer is 2.5, waiting on one guy to make offer who was first so you‚Äôd be third in line! 
---
Dude I experienced nearly the same thing after reaaalllyy struggling to build the excavator armor. Took me like five different play sessions to get enough damn screws and black titanium and I was on my way to building the last arm to complete the quest and I accidentally scrapped the frame in my inventory. I thought all the other armor pieces were scrapped and was devastated. Luckily, like your edit explains they just were put individually into the inventory but damn was I bummed at first. 
---
All I read was Melee/mutations OP. /thread 
---
:P
---
Was using pump for a while. Then found the power of the double. Double barrel is certainly what I‚Äôd suggest.
---
Patch 8 whenever it gets deployed, let‚Äôs you name items.
---
Ah yes this piece!  I hear tell this can go for 5-7k.  What‚Äôs your offer?  
---
People shit on 76 but the rendering and draw distance for this game even on consoles is impressive. 
---
I'd definitely be down to help 100+ bloodied melee build just don't have anything to shoot the bots down lol
---
I'm low on caps but i have a bloodied/ss boxing glove for trade.
---
How do you start the nuka cola paint quest?
---
What time zone is OP in?
---
OK then. I guess I need to do the excavator quest. I'm on an alt, my second character, so I havent done it yet. Guess I will. Thanks!
---
Xbox? I just happen to have a spare... (and no, not an April Fool's joke, I'm in NZ and it's nearly 3pm Monday here)

Sounds like a bug. Look forward to finding out.

I'd like a suit too if it's 60 caps for flux cost? 
---
I‚Äôm not a bloodied build unfortunately, but thank you! 
---
IXRebornVI is my GT I'd be down 
---
This.  ^.   people are super quick to forget the hot mess it was released as.   Alot of the hate was earned through huge product missteps as well.  
---
I have two keycards.  Just need the codes.  I‚Äôm online now if you are down.  I‚Äôm interested in nuking fissure prime but for the flux not for the SBQ.
---
I was wrong before. It‚Äôs 4 violet flux. It would be 120 caps to cover flux cost or you can provide the flux and I‚Äôll make it for free
---
im joining you thanks a ton pal!
---
I agree slightly. I would have preferred to do less dmg, I feel like I just do none half in half my swings 
---
Check the link I have in the post, it has a few images. I was able to paint my PA and use it.
---
I'd be cool with the price

Ok. I have an instigating explosive harpoon, tse lever? If not thats ok . Thx for the reply

Yeah I'm online as well and nuka crypt or Reddit usually has the codes for each solo

I‚Äôm actually a shotgun build so I‚Äôm super sorry!  If you had an AAE Shotgun I would consider trading something haha! 
---
Now that's a glitch I believe,  like when you VATS and it's 95% but doesn't hit? Now that's the real bullshit (serendipity/unstoppables magazines an exception here of course)
---
Np!! üëç
---
That's kind of a stretch.  If you look at something like the handmade, there are basically 3 types of barrel profiles with long and short versions (regular, aligned, and stabilized).  A standard long barrel is lighter than the standard short (draco-length) barrel.  Same profile.  Not sure about the other two profiles as I don't have 76 open atm.
---
Lots of multiplayer games are extremely rough at release
---
Thanks I'll need it lol

Karma System? [Got'cha covered!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b730e5/raider_mode_instead_of_survival_mode_better_name/) *(It's a long read I admit, but I swear it's worth it!)*
---
If you have ideas on how to implement "helping others" to the system, I'll be happy to add it to the post!
---
Changes are coming with the vendor update, they won't be able to destroy camps on adventure servers, looking forward to the change.
---
Well, I bought a chem recipe, and it didn't add to my total, so that's out. I'm guessing you are right about some things not registering, but I also don't think there are enough cooking recipes yet to complete it. Maybe Bethesda will go back and fix this after there are actually enough recipes in the game to complete it.
---
Yeah that was literally me just now. I switched to adventure mode as soon as it happened and saw them in my inventory and was like thank god thats what happens. 
---
Added 
---
And Springs, if you want to repair weapons. 
---
See all those Battered Clipboards? Pick 'em all up! They have springs heh
---
Yay
---
If you did it for no other reason than to be one... then yes. 
---
Thanks for the heads up. I always check the shop, but you never know. Appreciated either way :)
---
Wat are the legendary effects?
---
Pretty sure its not a bug and just intentional 
---
Yeh, nah lol
---
Depending upon the rifle you're comparing it too, pistols use a little less than 1/2 to to slightly more than 1/3 less AP per shot in VATS. Assault rifle is the most AP efficient rifle, then Combat Rifle, Handmade is an AP pig.
---
The Western Revolver is the best handgun, i'd argue the Lever Action is a handgun. If you wear light enough armor, shadow mod it, and use level 3 sneak, you can get off 4 or more shots with a Western Revolver or Double Barrel shotgun without going into \[DANGER\].
---
Whoever did those calculations, showing that hardened/powerful automatic is the best for VATS/CRIT, has no idea what the damage equations are, how critical mods or targeted shots affect damage, or how damage works while in \[DANGER\], \[CAUTION\], or \[HIDDEN\]. The only claim you can make about non-critical receivers is that they have more CONSISTENT damage, because their Critical damage is trash, and critical receivers have wildly INCONSISTENT damage because a critical hit will do 2.5-20x more damage depending on the Critical receiver and targeted shot you   take in VATS.
---
It's basically instigating with 50 pct limb damage
---
As far as I know, you can't buy them anymore, nor can you learn them through scrapping.  I've heard of people finding them in random places, but the odds are very, very low.
---
"Can you please make the strongest perk card stronger?"
---
I think you are right. Even though Bethesda was very, very, very clear from the start about what this game was, and delivered exactly what they talked about, people's minds just were in a whole different place. They were mad this wasn't Fallout 5, and refused to accept that it wasn't.
---
Which is a shame. It's a very good game, and the game is only getting better and better.
---
Sadly I am on PC. That sucks.
---
Since I started me second character a lot of challenges that should have already been ticked off finally started completing. So I strongly suspect that at some point they patched broken challenges, but since I had already done them they didn't register, and now my second character is doing those same things and getting the challenge. Same thing happened with any PSN achievements I would have gotten during beta, they didn't register then, but they did on my second character because it was well after launch.
---
I use a clown outfit, sack hood with hoses and a chainsaw
---
Oh, that's not cool at all lol
---
Oh
---
Hill above the whitesprings bunker
---
What bug are you talking about?
---
Nice. Thank you friend. I don't ever use it but it's nice to have
---
Especially after playing enough survival 
---
I didn‚Äôt know percent to cripple was a legendary effect?
---
Could join maybe?
---
Am I missing? I swear to god it hits, and it sounds like it does
---
So if I‚Äôm lvl 28 and I get lvl 3 animal friend I could tame a death claw?
---
Missile launchers suffered probably most of all when they nerfed demolition expert.  They need to at least increase the base damage to make up for the difference in lost damage.   
---
I keep a bloodied quad barrel tracking launcher but now only carry a small amount of ammo for it.  They are fun to spam at flying scorchbeasts or flying bots but really underpowered for the weight to damage ratio compared to other more capable weapons.
---
Absolutely worthwhile. I've never been hard up for lead since I figured it out, but I spent way too long doing lead runs like you before I realized how much was down there and how easy it was to smelt lol
---
No, none of your armor legendaries will do anything while you're wearing PA, so your weight usage jumps up when you enter the suit. Usually you work around that with calibrated shocks.
---
I'm surprised at how much useful code from FO4 was discarded, while bugs from FO4 were somehow included.
---
Does it scale with midnight and noon. Or is it just 2 settings: day and night?
---
It'll make the hit sound but no damage at all.  Different from actually hitting and doing only very little damage. 
---
It's 50 pct limb damage not cripple. My mistake
---
I have 3 CHA  and when using maxxed out hard bargain with Grape mentats and I can sell a bulk copper for 20 caps each. I luckily found a location with a copper mine, with a bunch of copper nodes around the mine. I only need to make sure to make 70 bulks to max out Caps at vendors. 
---
Yes, I already have you added pigeon. We can totally try three camps. Any ideas on a good location? Maybe on the highway?  
---
Thanks for the tip. It's great when the egotistical dickbags identify themselves so we know to ignore them. 
---
You're awesome! 
---
Lets hope you get 420 upvotes.
---
Which perks did you upgrade.  Weapons artisan and makeshift warrior? Or something else?
---
I noticed that too. Hopefully.
---
Any offer good sir or ma‚Äôam? 
---
r/AirForce putting warheads on foreheads, even in cyberspace. 
---
If you are not seeing it, log out of the game then log back in.  It was not showing for me until I did so. 
---
Or 420 responses, by 4:20 on 4/20.
---
There were some up the hill at helvetica I believe, yummy intestines too
---
It has been hypothesized that the towers closer to the "end game" areas provide better loot.  So, those in the bottom right side of the map.
---
With that said, anecdotally, I've found that the loot leaves a lot to be desired regardless of tower you request from.
---
You got what you wanted 
---
yup. It's a sad affair...I've server-hopped at whitesprings twenty times today, trying to get calibrated shocks. Not a sausage.  I'm level 140. I've found them \_once\_ after spending, conservatively, twenty+ hours looking for them.   
---
The RNG in this game, in general, is fucking garbage. Legendary items? Almost all garbage. 
---
It was buggy but jeez their was an over reaction that wasn‚Äôt just about bugs. There were a lot of people who wanted the game to fail out of spite because for some reason they thought an online game made by Bethesda game studios betrayed them. I‚Äôm glad the community stuck with the game and that people bought it. I got 5 of my friends to buy it and pitch it to anyone I can because it‚Äôs exciting to think how good this game can get plus I love fallout. Also Bethesda reactions to the crisis by putting their heads down and getting to work fixing the game with all the negativity surrounding it really impressed me. 
---
This isn‚Äôt the first time this happened with a Bethesda game though and even though it wasn‚Äôt Bethesda game studios that made ESO but when that game launched it to had a lot of problems as well and it actually came pretty close to dying on PC until they launched it on consoles. The studio didn‚Äôt abandon it. That game 5 years later is among the best theme park MMOs on the market. I think its right up there with world of Warcraft with its player base in terms of numbers and I like fallout 76 better even though I plan on trying to new DLC that‚Äôs coming out for it in June. The necromancer class sounds to cool to pass up! 
---
I finally got it figured out after about 2 hours of looking. I should of stated that it wanted me to walk out of the building, then to the place where you get the forms. except there was no marker indicating what to grab. probably killed J47 about 12 times.
---
and don't get me started on the quest after where you have to go into the mine. not fun when you are level 33.
---
...well, that explains a lot. That takes the ONE slightly interesting aspect of survival mode and chucks it out the window for me. "starred legendary only"? What the fuck, bethesda?
---
Wearing the straight-jacket and standing outside Vault 76 with a chainsaw... WELCOME TO FALLOUT76 !!
---
Nice camp man!
---
That‚Äôs a pretty sweet gun congrats 
---
The one that repairs weapons to 200% of its normal condition which I guess is weapon artisan (not on the game atm so I forget the name) I also have makeshift warrior maxed but I don't use it anymore because of the way i have my build set up
---
Thx bud
---
I will, after expierencing the happiness and joy that I felt when they dropped their loot for me should be a feeling experienced by everyone new to the game.
---
5200?
---
If bloodied isn't your thing why are you looking to purchase it?
---
There is, but it's an absolute shitshow of non-stop random postings
---
No.
---
What if we bring him a 3* to scrap we get a chance to obtain those perks as mods to build onto pieces of armor we have? 
---
Too bad you can't wear the asylum hat on top of the sack hood
---
Pretty sure they shed light on some of the inner workings of how it may work recently. Its supposed to be a credit system(which I think all of us saw coming).
---
Juicehead did a video recently on the topic recently. May wish to pop over and give it a listen.
---
I'd say the Division 2 is worth it if you have friends to play with, it's chock-full of endgame content but it's definitely a difficult dreg solo. If anything it's missing personality.
---
I was digging Anthem for a while, it's foundation and movement is fantastic but it's so damn shallow and wastes your time too much.
---
Gotcha. I will take a look at my repair on my axe tomorrow and see if it does the same thing. 
---
No i own the BE lever looking for other options
---
Weapon Artisan is the 200% condition perk card. When I saw "weaponsmith" I was gonna check if you were mixing them up, lol. If you're using Artisan then I'm stumped on why it's not bringing it up to 200% condition. I've never had that happen with any other melee weapons but I've never used Grognak's Axe so idk. Sorry.
---
How unlucky would that greaser have to be to have a nuke land in you Pre-War? Lol 
---
/r/fallout exists. Go there?
---
Well yes. It was basically a purge of everyone that immigrated from call of duty, Black ops, and the myriad of other stupid games. No people that enjoy single player, adventure games, and world building can play in peace. The only reason I ever go into adventure mode now is to acquire extra caps and experience. But my majority of play time is done on adventure mode. 
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. The one that covers Whitespring in range is how I got my old anti armour gauss rifle. So here‚Äôs hoping. 
---
If the other person doesn‚Äôt go higher than this it‚Äôs yours!  
---
Oh, I am sorry.  I misunderstood your post. My apologies. 
---
And also fallout 76 is progressing a lot faster than ESO. ESO has one major content update with craglorn and then had nothing new added to it for over a year I believe before they released the imperial city DLC.  Fallout 76 is getting major content releases less than 5 months after its release. They‚Äôve had to have put in a lot of work to get to this point and from what I read they have an entire game studio working on nothing but fallout 76 so the game is going to get content fast.  This is unprecedented for an online game to be moving this rapidly towards new content which is 100% free. I actually spent my first $20 to but atoms the other day because I think they deserve it and mostly because I really wanted the vault tech power armor skins! 
---
That would be cool
---
I found a few in the forest around Flatwoods today; particularly to the north and also east heading toward Sutton. I seem to stumble on them a lot less frequently than other critters, tho. :/
---
Really? It sounds to me like you're willing to be Bethesda's punching bag.
---
Only communists smoke the devils lettuce
---
I get disconnected at least once every 3-4 hours on a PS4 (adventure mode; redundant ISP with instant backup and no downs detected).
---
It's at its worst mid-afternoon CST.
---
I find bulk copper at the train vendors every now and then. It's kinda random 
---
You damaged him with the shock so PvP was initiated.
---
F in chat for the Greasers
---
So much better! I had some kid who was a much higher level than me trying to pvp in adventure. I told him if he wants a real challenge, I'll take him on in survival where there is level balancing!
---
He wasn't so keen to fight after that!
---
I hate high level players trying to pick small fights.
---
Also, Flamer mod paired with a Long Bow Bar adds mood lighting to the terror fest.
---
What's the problem with it? You say fix, but dont say what its issue is? I dont rhi k its ment to be a real competitor, same as the drill. Ot does damage, just not a ridiculous amount.
---
That‚Äôs the problem though the game should‚Äôve been f2p by how runny and droopy it is. It‚Äôs not a stable world still till this day. They keep nerfing things that were fun. They literally added bells and whistles when another player does something in survival. 
---
It‚Äôs direction is being sabotaged internally. I paid 60 bucks for a game that grates on my nerves and doesn‚Äôt feel like anything fallout in anyway. It‚Äôs not the multi player that‚Äôs the issue, it‚Äôs the way they implement things in a non fallout or lore friendly way. People do not want call of duty- but want to play stories that may delve into military subject. Bos and enclave fit this but they make the conflict about a leaderboard score instead of setting up a story and letting the players fill out the roles organically. 
---
I feel like I‚Äôve seen that for 12-15k some may even pay 20-25k
---
Not a cave by any stretch, but I found a little hidden area under the highway close to General's Steakhouse. Had a desk in there and a safe too. I built near to it and used this spot for dropping excess loot to come back and  scrap later when doing SBQ runs. Look for dry creek beds right next to the road. I do remember it had the road barriers I had to jump over to get into the creek bed
---
My first band-aid was a flame-thrower?
---
"It does barely any damage at all. It doesn't drop as loot, therefore it is super rare and doesn't have legendary variants. It only spawns in a level 20 variant. It isn't affected by melee damage perks."
---
Skip uranium fever, it caps at lvl 40 loot. 
---
If only 
---
I wonder if he is in the same area in all the servers at the same times. He was there for me too.
---
Well that was one hell of a Nuka Shine adventure 
---
Yea I'm not on the game atm so when I wrote the title of the post I guess I mixed it with the Gunsmith perk but yea I meant to type Weapon Artisan.
---
Got 5500. 
---
Thanks for the tip. It‚Äôs great when the egotistical dickbags identify themselves so we know to not piss them off.
---
Fixed that for you üòé
---
It is not part of the Nuka Cola T-51 paint quest.
---
yes
---
I often find one when i spawn into whitespring service entrance
---
I dont know. This is the first time I caught him here.
---
You are so disingenuous. You know damn well what people were actually mad about and they had every right to be upset.
---
 &gt; This isn‚Äôt the first time this happened with a Bethesda game
---
Exactly, and you keep sticking up for them, every time. This is why they get away with it. Why do we have to pay them full price, then microtransactions and maybe get a good game five years from now?
---
Bring back New Vegas style mole rats
---
Class freak doesn't reduce the negative effects of empath mutation. You always receive 33% more damage instead of 33\*0.25 = 8.25% (with 3 star class freak)
---
Every time I see a post like this I die a little inside. How old are you, five? "haters failed at crushing fallout 76" What's with this conspiracy theory bullshit? No one tried to "crush" this game. This game doesn't have "haters". 
---
This game launched as a bug-filled, unpolished mesh surrounded by the worst controversy the publisher has \_ever\_ faced. It deserved every bit of negative criticism it's received.  Servers are more stable than they were at launched, and I still don't go a single day without at least one random disconnect.   
---
It made it's bed. It's just fucking \_amazing\_ that it's still online at all, and that there's forward development that's fixed the worst of the early game bugs. (though fuck knows, every update still introduces quite a few..for example, if i try to wear any non faschnacht hat,  when I log in, I don't have a fucking head).   
---
" This game has to be the most hated on game in the history of gaming  " Just...no. There are games that have been banned from entire fucking \_countries\_ before.   
---
Just make sure you be very, very quiet.
---
Sounds like bethesda is saying this isnt a real weapon, but a fun variant of a Wesson. Also it's not super rare of theres a 100% drop on exact locations. If you want a real weapon that has that effect, use the handy buzz blade.
---
Also of you repair to 200% and add mods, youd be surprised the damage. I ran wotoga high for fun with both. They do well as is, just not well pvp. 
---
When I repaired it last 100% it was a beast lol
---
He needs to it to complete his set so I‚Äôm gonna go with him, thanks for the offers though! 
---
Yes, this is actually a top priority feature request in my opinion.  I don't know how many other PC players feel as strongly as I do about its importance, but right now it's either use a mic, or don't talk at all.  Emotes are not enough to convey a proper conversation.
---
I worry that Bethesda is purposely dragging their feet on this one for one reason or another.  I believe there may have been evidence there was a leftover text chat system in the game, but nothing became of it.
---
Ah, so you've got a lot of junk in your stash trunk! I hear dudes like that.
---
It's pretty involved. Check out this [guide.](https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/26/fallout-76-nuka-cola-power-armor-paint/)
---
I enjoy 76, but...to say that it's "functionally like 4"...4 had quests, NPCS, companions, a much more in-depth settlement building system...
---
Xbox ps4 or pc?
---
Neat idea! I like that it plays on the retained memories. The petrified corpses that look into baby cots or kids' rooms just gut me every time I see them. I would love to see that longing and sadness honored more in enemy behavior.
---
He likes the damn location 
---
Ok
---
Oh for sure. I made a build around that but honestly it is only indicative of what might have been. Imagine if you didn't have to essentially hack it into doing proper damage. Or if it dropped in level 50 variants instead of level 20. Or if there were legendaries!
---
You're assuming that is supposed to be affected. Also you don't to be blooded to be an empath but as someone who has played one for a very long time, I have no problems.
---
I like mine, but be aware that you're going to be repairing a bit more than the others (IME).
---
damn more than i would of thought
---
Try the other door. There's one in the back and one in the front. Maybe it helps? Never had the issue myself so I'm just guessing.
---
It's in part because it's worse than a normal one during the day so the jump appears more dramtic
---
Yeah, that stuff always gets me, kinda like the Pompeii casts of people in their last mements.
---
Why two shot of these weapons? The are usually used as sniper weapons, but the two shot perk brings down accuracy a whole lot.
---
Was it by the golf club?
---
Lol.
---
I used to love bioware‚Äôs games but it seems they have missed the mark the last couple of outings and they also made the most disappointing game ever in Star Wars the Old republic. Not because the game was bad but because after they were bought by EA they almost all but abandoned it turning it into a free to play and releasing content at a snails pace. The pvp In SWTOR was amazing for world pvp but then they had some sort of stupid game show for the battle grounds. Oh it‚Äôs so disappointing that the game ultimately failed. I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen with anthem but unlike Bethesda whose owner by ZeniMax, EA has little patience to try to get a game right and has shown more than once that they aren‚Äôt above completely abandoning games and making customers feel as if they really did waste their money. I don‚Äôt trust EA but I know BioWare is on life support with anthem. If it fails then EA will probably close the studio so I guarantee they are going to try their best to turn anthem into a good game. I hope they do. 
---
As far as the division 2 goes you‚Äôre right it doesn‚Äôt look like it has much personality or a very creative world although I think that Ubisoft has been making some really good games as of late. I‚Äôm just not sure if it‚Äôs my style or not. Is the devision 2 a big open world? That‚Äôs ultimately what turns me off about destiny and destiny 2 because the world is so limited so more or less the only thing to do is run the strikes over and over again which gets old quick.
---
Where is this at? Or a normal spawn at?
---
I‚Äôve got the same weapon and I‚Äôve been looking for a nice weight reduced Minigun or other heavy gun for trade for it. (Xbox)
---
Needs a cooldown to reburrow, like how they fixed the scorchbeast scream.
---
So if the other variants work, why not the chainsaw. The Ripper and Buzzblade were intended as real weapons and work the same in function, but even they are broken compared to their Fallout 4 variants. I think all auto-melee weapons should be viable, especially the chainsaw as it is the most fun. The argument I'm hearing is "but what if it just stayed shitty," and I find that uncompelling as an argument. 
---
Todd burned our crops, poisoned our water and brought a plague onto our land!
---
Oh, I didn't know that at all
---
Copper takes a lot longer to gather than other stuff surely? With that logic it sounds just running a few times through west tech and scrapping / bulking wood and metals would be more valuable. 
---
Seasons in adventure mode would completely kill this game. I'm 140 levels in, and I haven't had a _single_ high end drop. Which, I keep pointing out, is a big part of why the dupers had such a huge client pool. If you can't get decent gear through normal gameplay, it's  tempting to buy it. 
---
They also didn't fix duping in any real sense. They're playing wack-a-mole, and more importantly they've reduced storage capacity, reducing the negative affects of duping on game stability. 
---
I get what your saying but RNG going to RNG. From what I‚Äôve heard I‚Äôm just happy that (insert 3 star weapon that‚Äôs dropped) can eventually be a good roll if you play enough, and all those total trash rolling pins and etc can be useful.
---
Yeah pacifist will make it so you have to retaliate but if you claim a workshop you are fair game to everyone. Id also keep my steel. You need it for most mods and ammo.
---
That‚Äôs what the perk does? Reduces the negative effects of mutations. Why would it not reduce it?
---
That happened to me as well on PS4
---
It'll be even better when you can't hurt camps, so I can freely accept random team invites
---
(Laughs in 3* Explosive Ordnance and Bear Arms)
---
Heavy Build Best Build change my mind
---
Nah it makes sense really. If a player wants to damage your camp, he'll do more than just the generator, trust me lol. Mobs are just coded to heavily go for your generator it seems.
---
I bought mine as a combo deal which included a 3* bloody handmade for 6k just a couple weeks ago
---
They arent aweful- just not the best weapons in the game. You need to find a good mod, I find the watoga train station had it often, the extra long arm bar? Or the boudle flame bar is good. And you have to make it 200% repair and it unlocks a new level of damage. Take that every tic - and it does good damage. But dont expect to fight the queen with it.
---
It just jumps up at 6 PM and stays at that until 6 AM when it falls
---
How much you selling it for?
---
Nah. No one gives a shit about you and your one day old reddit account. 
---
Orly? I've seen squirrels on the train station side of the building but I'll have to look over there, thanks
---
Pc
---
And yet, here you are, giving a shit enough to come by and tell me no one gives a shit.
---
Oxymoron, much? 
---
I've played with Flamer, Bow Bar, Long Bow Bar, dual bar and all the perks neccessary to make it viable. And it is viable, if you want to carry 4 around because they degrade so quick you have to shuffle through them to have anything resembling a decent game flow. I just want them to not require all that to be a contender. 
---
Just got it free...thanks for putting this on Reddit!...22 hrs left of free hunting cap.
---
1000 caps or best offer
---
I get a dumb amount of steel just by scrapping weapons though. I had a lot of wood which as far as I can tell is only used for cooking and camp building and it's quite plentiful anyways
---
It made its bed? The game has actually sold really well, the player base is growing and I‚Äôm not sure if you noticed but there‚Äôs quite the community here on reddit for it.  Also I‚Äôm not sure if you noticed but Bethesda released a road map for it, had a public discussion about it Friday talking about what‚Äôs to come in the future and is releasing content on a weekly basis now. So I‚Äôm not sure what kind of bed you‚Äôre talking about or where you coming up with you reasoning skills but it‚Äôs certainly not based logical conclusion via evaluating the evidence. 
---
I swear, make another joke an I'm going nuclear...
---
Well until you said that... I considered nocturnal not worth picking up
---
This changes things. Not much, but a little bit.
---
I don't deny any of these points, I certainly miss companions, but given the nature of 76, I think at least there should've been a solo section, more an extended tutorial on how the game was going to run, with an AI companion. Until, you hit a point where they pack you a lunch and set you off into the wild. No Human NPC's was a bad idea, but they still manage to give you enough seeking quests, and it's just the same thing, but handled by robots or holotapes.
---
I turned in around 4 today. The last hour I was on there the server was acting out.
---
Amazing! I've been looking for them forever.
---
Highly sought after. Just today I saw one go for 15k+. That particular roll should go even higher because of the last vats perk (the only one that might command more is weight reduction but that‚Äôs personal preference). 
---
I guess my next question is how old are you 20? It would explain why you haven‚Äôt developed reasoning skills yet as the brain isn‚Äôt fully developed at that age.
---
All depends on who‚Äôs looking to buy, everyone values items differently but to the right person that roll is priceless
---
I"m bored and laughing at the weirdo bragging about his ability to use VATS to murder people. The level of attachment to your bullshit is...slim. 
---
Just happened to me right now...
---
Yup it‚Äôs been bugged for awhile, Bethesda has said they‚Äôre aware but have yet to fix it 
---
Melee players were going around one and two shot killing everyone in PVP but I think people have just adapted.   Maybe more people have the blocker perk equipped now whereas in the past they didn't.  I never bothered with it until very recently.
---
Im also waiting for Player Vending.
---
You probably see a lot of post like this because people either are enjoying the game or are dumb struck when they buy it and realize it‚Äôs no where near as bad as people on YouTube comments make it out to be. 
---
Well, I think the reason is because it‚Äôs not a *useful* bug.
---
That doesn't explain Frasnacht though, which as I understood it was partially to celebrate that Spring was approaching (burning of the Old Man Winter effigy).
---
If time was legitimately static in 76, then this event which relates to seasons wouldn't be taking place.
---
However, one could also argue that the the reason it appears as though time stands still otherwise (from the viewpoint of it being a Simulation), would be that it was the last usable data-point to be incorporated. 
---
Im getting off in a few mins
---
Keep telling yourself that Holmes. You seem intent on telling me just how you feel about me. You don‚Äôt see me on your shit professing my feelings...
---
So I see I‚Äôm making you feel some type of way! How cute :)
---
Same here
---
Speculative statement rooted in paranoia: As soon as the weed industry pays Beth to promote their 'industy's' wares it will most likely make it in game...I wonder if all the alcohol being promoted in game now is a result of the alcohol industry writing Beth a check.
---
In the TV industry it is called product placement.
---
Mine's the same way, I've switched to a super sledge with the same modifiers for the time being.
---
I go solo with 4 points in charisma, I don‚Äôt even use lone wanderer, in my opinion as a two handed melle build tenderizer at 3 and Rad Sponge at 1 is better
---
Great for traders! I love this idea.
---
I dont think explosive benefits from AA but that's normal
---
You can server hop at robco research in cranberry bog for the event awol armaments, i have gotten a lot of multi star max level legendaries at that event
---
VATS critical attacks cut through assassin/ sentinel. 
---
Ok, I‚Äôll try it. Thanks for the tip!
---
Also I feel the amount of damage increase you get from Weapon Artisan, and the fact that it is so astronomically far beyond the damage buff any other melee weapon gets, shows that there is some massive error in damage calculation for that weapon. 
---
Unfortunately it's not a real answer as to "where".  Since it seems to be a "any place that you might get random plan spawns" in a container.
---
I found 3 other plans in the same area inside containers, and they were all CAMP items (Barn Building Set, Gas Signage, Wood Rocking Chair).
---
But they could sell chat emjoi and stickers instead!
---
/s
---
I know that explosive doesn't benefit from any effect because it's based on the guns base/perked damage but I've heard around that the anti armor effect is negated by the explosive effect
---
I dunno. Us queers have been pretty open about leather harnesses and whips and stuff that are depicted in some apocalyptic games/shows/books. So basically the queer and kinky folk will be running the show. 
---
Imagine how much better your idea would be if Bethesda added in even single song that was ever in a fallout games radio song list to choose from, so you could make a "Best of Fallout" soundtrack.
---
But he said they put the same
---
Limitations in adventure mode - for PVE or just PVP?  Is this true?
---
I get the feeling that someone though about the time thing long enough to realise they either needed to have "constant time signal" advancing everyone clocks at the same time or have everyone running around with there own subjective time and date. and around this point they kinda went "eh fuck it that sounds like a lot of work and goddamn seasons" and left it as a single unmoving day and went and had a 3 drink lunch.
---
I've had this since January (random, not the named weapon). Even with max Demo perk and the other two it's not that great.
---
Thank you, I stopped in after this post and also saw the desert camo PA/armor/weapon skins bundle that I absolutely HAD to get. 1500 atoms for all that, yes please. Haven't had time to play recently so I may have very well missed this if not for your post
---
if that happened from the warheads launched during the great war, shouldnt his corpse be nothing but a skeleton right now ? Like all the other ones ?
---
Every PA has got that mod however You need to buy/drop plans for every type of PA separately. 
---
Grafton has got it for excavator, watoga vendor for any other apart from Ultracite and X01.
---
And it‚Äôs an easy event if you have the right loadout 
---
No fix for you... but mine bugged out the other way around.  Every time I log in the game tells me to go turn in Tech Data...
---
I think about this all the time! Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one üòπ
---
No it's not . Lol.
---
Protectrons are 50
---
Assaultrons are 42
---
Gutsy are 52
---
Annihilator MKII is 60( I think)
---
They're several foods that increase weight limit: you might have eaten some. 
---
Watoga then hop over to whitesprings then server hop 
---
Thats a great point, though the date still didnt change during fasnacht, which was a limited time event in one area. 
---
Theoretically it could be explained as additions to the simulation along with other DLC
---
Vendor at Grafton Town Hall has got all the plans for Excavator.
---
ü§£
---
Helvetia. 
---
Yes that sucks. 
---
Robobrains are 40 I think, the rest you have listed are correct
---
Not sure who's downvoting us, but its just a discussion.
---
Fuck people sometimes.
---
Are we even pretending cannon matters anymore? In all honesty i'd rather FO76 was written off as a fever dream rather than letting Bethesda think that people don't care about story they just want super mutants and BOS and those other fallout tropes crammed into a "open world"
---
This can never happen: because people who copy right would destroy this game. Just play pandora while you play. Problem solved.
---
I firmly believe by the end of this year, the game will have NPCs. Nothing Bethesda or haters have to say will convince me otherwise. Just looking at the map for the rest of the content this year, the presence of the NPC-esque character in the secret room players managed to access, and the fact that it is almost universally asked for - I have to believe it‚Äôs coming. 
---
Personally I‚Äôm fine without them, but I know I‚Äôm in a very large minority. 
---
Over level 95 and I can still get my ass handed to me by 3 assualtrons (assuming I have my character weapons) 
---
Aw man I already bought these...
---
Ah! Knew the list looked off.  Thanks man
---
Ohhh right there were some around for Fasnacht, wasn't sure if they stayed spawning. Also I mostly remember finding squirrels there, but I think I remember a couple rabbits so I'll probably try there. Thanks
---
Beat me to it. Bethesda should really do like a short from fallout 4, explaining pvp in detail, and a few warnings about mutations/ reactive plates. 
---
"Some clever duelists use their opponent's mutations against them, starting the fight at their convenience rather than the victims."
---
They said the exact opposite. Once near the launch of Fallout 76, and again at Pax recently. There's no release date, but you will be able to use them on private servers.
---
Thats a possibility for sure! any off the top of your head?
---
I think there's a few reasons behind the Fallout 76 hate train:
---
New launcher. 1) (despite it going on Steam soon: too little too late)
---
Atomic Shop: 2)
---
Nuke System 3)
---
Forced PvP 4) (which was certainly now just resolved)
---
There's a lot of reasons why Fallout 76 wasn't necessarily received well at launch. Rife with optimization issues and other problems. Whether or not you like it, the game was received poorly. Very poorly. I still play the game, but I think it's a little dishonest to say it didn't fail. It's still immensely dispopular to many people. If you speak of it anywhere else, it's still bad word of mouth. The game still has many issues. I don't know if it's necessarily a strong foundation, but the game's reputation is already tainted and the word of mouth is unanimously typically in distaste. 
---
Which is why no humans are around besides us, as it would be too great a computational load for the simulator to contend with. The amount of responses alone that would need to be kept unique as to not tip off the users (us) would be immense. With only real people interacting with each other, their responses are real-time and simply passed from one brain to the next.
---
By comparison, animals are a very simple thing to compute. Their response is pretty much A or B. Fight, or Flight.   
---
Super Mutants are the most complex thing it has to deal with, which is why they have such crude speech. 
---
I'm really kidding though, there's absolutely zero lore that I'm pulling from on this, and I'm just explaining away why aspects of how 76 are how they are for us and relating them as reasons to how it makes sense it's a simulation, all for my own bemusement lol   
---
It works though, doesn't it? ;)
---
Oh god, what if we're all just the drunken-misfiring synapses in what's left of Biv's brain?!?!?  O\_O
---
Well you can find military circuit boards and a circuit board without transistors is a poor showing normally :P 
---
Level 52 Gutsy's with Anti-Armor rounds scare me...
---
Yesterday I was running around Watoga killing Protectrons, and a Legendary Assaultron spawns.  So I kill it.
---
But then the swarm of level 52 Mr. Gutsy's show up.  Like... 8 of them.  So I start killing them, luckily half were lasers.
---
But then the tube spawned a Level 52 2* Legendary Gutsy, with the Anti Armor bullets.  I'm still picking off the other regular Gutsy's.  And I died... embarrassing, but it all happened so fast I wasn't prepared for it.
---
Worst part about it, the Legendary 2* one was at about 25% HP (already regenerated once).  But it disappeared after it killed me.
---
Alcohol does for sure. My build is based around it somewhat lol
---
I'm strictly melee, so I'll use the bunker buster to tag a scorchbeast so I get credit in case my group kills it before it lands. I only keep about 15 missiles in my stash at any given time.
---
I‚Äôll upvote this every time someone else mentions it. Love my axe can‚Äôt wait until it can be repaired over 100%
---
I mean you could get a nocturnal that isn‚Äôt too heavy so you could always have it on you and only use at night and use something else during the day
---
Ah. Private servers. Characters likely wont carry over.
---
Luck is tied to looting. It's usually what I sink the first special points into. It's cards pharma farmer and scrounger are tied to aid and ammo respectively, getting those help you out immensely, I prefer butcher's bounty (perception) over can do. Remember you have to press a button to search for the extra stuff. 
---
After you collect some junk, view it in component view in your pipboy. Here tag lead, items containing lead will now be pointed out. Lead is often included with other mats, just focusing on it will give you enough but not too much wood and steel. 
---
Holly shit dude. Take a chill pill. Three replies? The edit button exists for a reason. I get you've got a pretty serious case of rabid fanboyism, but damn. 
---
"It made it's bed" in this context, means that all negative criticism is justly deserved due to delivering a poor product at launch, as well as producing a seemingly endless string of questionable (the no refunds policy, leaking personal data, the nuka rum fiasco, ignoring the mounting duping issue for months, only to "fix" it with draconian measures that negatively affected non-duping players) to outright ILLEGAL (opting people into advertising systems, fraudulently changing delivered product without notice), 
---
This game has had a never-ending string of issues, and so has the publisher. Every youtube video, negative review, and disgruntled user who's talked about it came by their viewpoints honestly, because this game was _trash_ at launch, and the company fucked up in _multiple_ serious ways. 
---
This game has been out for MULTIPLE MONTHS. The roadmap's been in place for a couple of weeks. The last major PR disaster was what, a month ago now? 
---
They've been making steady progress. They're sticking with the game, they're pushing out updates, they're pushing out new content, and they are slowly, bit by bit, turning this early access nightmare into a halfway decent game. 
---
And for that? I will give Bethesda props. They could have ditched this product. They could have dropped it when it got panned on release, but they didn't. 
---
They keep working on it, they keep making it better, and that's the only reason I stick around. 
---
I mean like, PC, xBox, or Ps
---
When it happened to me I dropped it, picked it up. It reset something. Or maybe try a friend if you're worried of losing the bag
---
YES, two songs. country roads, and big iron.
---
All this info from this lovely thread has told me nuke runs are a piece of chocolate cake with chocolate chips on top with my weapons armor (lvl 70)
---
Damn lol
---
Make it triggered by Nukashine - you wake up and just see the skyrim intro video which fades back to fallout after a few moments
---
Alot of those kill, learn or discover locations are bugged for me. It's sad and hopefully it gets fixed soon. With all these updates there's going to be a lot of new atom shop items.
---
I had to restart the game
---
[when every high level user drops off stuff to the lower levels (exepecting them to pay it forward)](https://i.imgur.com/W0PwVFK.gif)
---
Totally agree. It‚Äôs considered a melee weapon and should get some perk card buffs. I‚Äôm even ok with it not being able to go over lvl 20 if it‚Äôs able to be buffed in some fashion from perk cards.
---
Probably not, but that's fine. I wouldn't mind restarting if that meant I could add mods to my world.
---
There are two kinds of people. Those who have something bad happen to them and think "I don't want this to happen to others because it sucks." and then there's that special kind of people who say "it happened to me, other people should have it happen too."
---
So basically those with empathy vs those who lack emotional intelligence.
---
"They say misery loves company, we should start a company and make misery. Frustrated Incorporated."
---
I mean, "mildly amused" is a feeling? 
---
I'm on xbox1 and don't know if it differs, but sometimes when fixing weapons with weapon artisan you have to repair the main weapon, then scroll down and scroll back up to recheck the weapon you fixed, the extra weapon durability should show up.
---
Thank you for the information! Handled fast again thanks!
---
it's using the songs from the game, in game. they can't copyright that. that's like saying that you can't eat an apple because it'll rot.
---
I know the feels.. literally just bought this a week or two ago :/
---
I was really wanting these, thanks for the heads up!
---
I imagine if they fixed this they would just increase the negative effect so it reduces down to 33%. Mutation is too strong otherwise.
---
Yeah, I got pissed when I lost over 400 caps because of an asshole that spawn camped me and razed my camp, I placed a bounty on him, he served hopped, and I never saw my caps again
---
Ive been wondering the same thing. I have seen no mentions or people talking about not getting it or anything. I havent even gotten one as a sample from BIV. Makes me wonder if it is actually part of the BIV questline or if like the Hard Lemonade is from somewhere else entirely.
---
No, they have to pay for rights for the song, and to use it. Depending on negotiations, it may not be profitable to keep more radio stations on inauguration world, where we have spotify and pandora.
---
It's not "just the same thing" in my mind, because the sheer lack of quests, and the lack of forking quest options, is drastically different. 
---
I mean yes, of course, a lot of things are similar, it's a fallout game, there are common items, weapons armor types, lore, mobs...but it doesn't PLAY like fallout 4 does, because you don't have branching quest paths, you don't have charisma checks on dialog options, you don't have...
---
A lot of shit. There's a lot of shit that's "missing" if you're directly comparing it to 4. 
---
It's it's own thing, and that's fine, but it's less of an RPG than any other fallout game. 
---
I see you‚Äôve stopped down to 3rd grade level irrelevant and asinine comments. That‚Äôs cool. I got what I wanted from you anyway. Goodnight bro. 
---
You can't compare ESO to 76 in any way shape or form.
---
If you're level 120 with decent gear you could most definitely solo launch a nuke. I know it's not as fun without a group but it's doable. I launched one when I was only leveled in the 30s. Figured I'd see how far I would get, not expecting to go far, and made it to the end. You really just have to be able to take on assaultrons and a crap ton of turrets.
---
Thanks! I didn't know they were going to be free!
---
Genius
---
I'm greedy and want it all, Legendaries, high level variants, AND proper perk integration. Still, having perks apply would go a long way!
---
I'm almost positive what your saying is exactly what they said will happen... 
---
Trade In  to customize your own guns or trade in for new. Go take another look at those videos.
---
I avoid the explosive throwing weapons like grenade Launcher, missile, fatman.
---
I've lost count of the number of times that server lag would cause the projectile to drop to the ground mid arc. 
---
There is a lot of areas under the highway from there down to watoga (: that's where I'm built now. Want a cave so it's easy to close off and cannot be hit in pvp
---
Your character doesn't grow beyond 50, after 50 it's just optimization of perks and gear.
---
Also, in general, enemy levels aren't a good indication of difficulty.  A level 68 Scorched is about as deadly as a level 15 Ghoul.  But a level 52 Gutsy can slay you in a couple seconds if it catches you by surprise.
---
This has become my new favorite way to manage my inventory. Whenever I see a noob coming out of the vault I pop over to drop off some purified water, Rad Away/X, some food and a weapon or two. Sometimes it‚Äôs frustrating trying to get them not to run, to see the paper bag and collect, but it‚Äôs worth it. I remember when this was done for me. Pay it forward 
---
&gt;the most hated on game
---
The ET Game
---
This community is toxic lmao now I see why people say this game is bad
---
Some death claw meat too
---
Why do you say that? 
---
I suppose so haha...
---
And if you‚Äôre on Xbox and have a level 50 All Rise and don‚Äôt want it, I know a guy with caps looking for one. 
---
It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm the guy. 
---
I didn‚Äôt know and did that quest at 35 and am kicking myself for it. 
---
but they paid the rights to the songs, it doesn't change anything. unless it stated that they can't make more than one radio that plays that song. it's completely fine.
---
If you have finished the BoS Questline, you can learn the Ultracite Power Armor plans by going to the top floor of Fort Defiance.
---
What system are you?
---
Or you could just die and respawn much quicker and with full health.
---
Uhh except none of the products in FO76 actually exist. What is in fallout isn't product placement.
---
Wonder which gun manufacturers paid Beth for the guns in game..
---
The best way to save your fav gear is to buy skins for it and paint them. By doing this, you can‚Äôt stop or scrap them. People you try to trade with can‚Äôt even see them so nobody will bug you about wanting your main gun or armor. Small fee to pay so you can‚Äôt drunk scrap/drop anything you actually care about. 
---
You didn‚Äôt complete form 3-A in white. Sorry. 
---
As someone who uses flares in Nuke zones to signal Legendaries I applaud this extra functionality. 
---
Pc 
---
oh ok thanks for letting me know! 
---
Yea I've noticed this with other weapons that I repair, but with Grog axe it just stays the same sadly.
---
It seems the last one, visibility on maps, may be an option coming with player vending.  I'm hoping it's a good amount of CAMP improvements coming with the vending feature.
---
One is a MMO and the other is 76. 
---
Even during beta I could talk to a npc and had text chat.
---
Comparing a MMO that released in 2014 to FO76 and saying that it's not so bad in comparison is disingenuous.
---
ESO is probably the best MMO out right now. FO76 isn't even a memory at only 5 months old. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôd love a legendary version of it lol
---
its a garbage weapon, just another grind to get another crappy reward.
---
ill stick to farming Adventure mode for better 3\* legendarys
---
Someone was running test to see if mister gusties were correct. Their suppose to be dealing  40% anti armour and as far they got it felt like 90%
---
I wish all the V Fast Melee weapons worked. Got a few Legendary Buzz Blades.
---
The only people who want sentinel not to stack are people that think that their pve builds should work in pvp. Literally every class has a way of killing some one in sentinel/cav in around 2 seconds. Swap out luxury perks, equip pvp perks to pvp. The dev's already know this because they took the time to balance armors already, so I am posting for the pve players not them.
---
Another thing I noticed was as I collect mods from them no longer auto scrapping, they got heavy. Scrap any mods you already know.
---
I have Burbon and Luck....and Nothing seems to be working.  I assume it means VATS Critical....but it isn't working at all.  I've already relogged once.  Anyone know what's going on?
---
Yea, if I wanted higher damage numbers I could just use my 200% repaired All Rise but then what kind of Grognak would I be if I didn't use the axe :/
---
This reminds me of attack on titan! Good idea
---
Items disappearing like that seems to be part of the games loading process. I see this all the time at the BoS vendor. The items on the shelf behind him will be there right after I fast travel to him, but then they disappear one by one shortly after. Not sure if its happening because I picked those items up too recently or because someone else grabbed them. 
---
A easy way to test if the game is still loading is trying to pick up whatever item from the ground (not a container) and seeing how long it takes for the item to actually disappear. If its gone instantly or within a second - the game is probably done loading. If it just stays there then the game is still loading junk items and you can't trust your eyes just yet.
---
Either way if you can't get the lead to reappear by server hopping, then that means its still on cooldown for you. What you could try is monitoring the silos and if you see someone go in there (and stay there for a bit - make sure they're not just there to grab the lead) follow them and there will be a good chance they spawned the lead by loading the cell first. 
---
This should also work for vtu / other low level locations. If you see a low level player in there, they're probably just doing the quest and not interested in the lead. As long as you get in there while the other player is still there as well you should be able to grab the lead they spawned in.
---
well i guess the weed "industry" is taking its time on this one maybe after a nap and something to eat oh yeah then he gotta go see his man first he'll get to you around like 10? 
---
Found that container -- no plans.
---
Same, i carry three Grog axes into battle just in case my main one breaks, but usually during SBQ event they end up all breaking, I find myself repairing them so much
---
I'm not able to drop the tech data at all. Tried to drop it for a buddy but no chance. 
---
Not saying all items in game are promotional...but some may be...a whole industry advertises a product......remember 'got milk'....not a specific type of milk...just promoting milk.
---
Did I miss a reference?
---
Weed industry is still a baby...and under a microscope with the feds.
---
If you want crops, I recommend going near the Silvia Homestead / Billings Homestead area.
---
There are some farms near there that have boatloads of corn and razorgrain already growing in the fields, so you can immediately have a gigantic crop on top of whatever you decide to plant.
---
The fields aren't 100% flat but it's a pretty gentle slope up and away from the riverside.
---
Ya it's kinda trash. Lol
---
It was just a glitch‚Äîone I found funny. That is all. 
---
Yeah, I never drink or take chems ever really, idk, maybe I did and didnt realize though, thanks
---
I'll have to give it a look tomorrow, might not help but I'll report back what i find.
---
Its not that im over encumbered its that my weight seems much lower than what it was
---
happy cake day
---
See that‚Äôs where I disagree. I believe the game definitely deserves criticism for being released with as many bugs as it had but I disagree that all of the criticism were based on that or even the controversies surrounding the quality of the bag that came with the special edition. This game was being hated on well before it was released. A lot of people just wanted it to fail because Bethesda was trying something new and because they thought it would take away from how fast the next elder scrolls game came out. Then it was also the creation engine because some YouTube who pretends to know how games are developed started ragging on the creation engine and it was like mass hysteria followed with people who pretended like they knew anything about it. Let‚Äôs not forget that these tools are what Bethesda has used for years to make some amazing titles and also that this engine is updated just like all the other tools people use to create games. I personally am not looking for a more tame Bethesda game that sacrifice the randomness and customization for more realistic character model. That‚Äôs also saying that all these things can‚Äôt actually be updated within the engine itself because they can and they have been through the years. So no the criticism wasn‚Äôt all deserved. 
---
yeh i knew it would be.
---
looks like all the legendary rewards for survival are trash.
---
they did a destiny and give good events and quests/challenges but the rewards are so underwhelming its just not worth touching survival atm.
---
The game sold well? News to me.
---
My local best buy cant even give away bundles with fo76 attached for *free* atm lmfao
---
But in that case, if someone puts time into their character, should they really be forced to making a new character and spending all that time just for PvP?
---
I have a vampire missile launcher with limb damage. Its pretty useless, except when fired into large groups of NPCs. Shooting a group of super mutants only to see them all kneeling with 1/2 life is really funny. Honestly not worth the weight.
---
What do people do with copper? I got bulks but not sure what to use with it?
---
That's the latter part of the ritual, when I need to summon Dagoth-Ur
---
I can‚Äôt upvote this enough 
---
I have my farm south of Sugar grove across from a power pylon lots of space i just don't have plans
---
I just did it because it's a named legendary.  I kinda want to get the lever too. Guess I will see what the challenge is.
---
76 has quests and NPCs as well tho.. and other players are your companions now. Functionally it really is very close to Fallout 4.
---
It's crazy but they thought of that too. Every level after 50 you keep getting points so you can but new perk cards to switch out ones that work for pvp....and every 5 lvls they still throw you 5 random free ones. No need to make a new character just swap out cards to pvp.
---
Such a great place. When the bots aren‚Äôt dropping dead or blowing up in your face. 
---
This game did fail...
---
Maybe they can save it, but it's going to take some genuinely decent content to do so, which will probably take years.
---
Pretty much everyone I know has stopped playing this game, and very few have actually purchased it.
---
It's almost like this post was written because you want to be told exactly what you want to hear...
---
Yeah as long as you‚Äôre there before it ends. I‚Äôve hit a couple events where it must have ended mid-loading and just wasn‚Äôt active when I showed up. 
---
I haven't really played since the fifth numbered update. It's too much of a grind for so little reward. I started a new character in FO4 and plan to play that all the way through.  Bethesda dropped the ball hard on F076 and they just made it worse with the new PVP mode. 
---
All you lose is your Junk tab, and like half your Aid tab.  You keep your weapons / armors / ammo / misc / holotapes
---
I used to use them a lot until they nerfed the demo perk for no reason at all whatsoever. I'm not salty. You're salty. 
---
But I still have the two shot quad targeting launcher. I use it every once in a while on an unsuspecting mole rat since that's about the only thing it can kill in one shot. 
---
I've used it in PvP before. Which was actually pretty fun. Do a marsupial jump over a wall and Target a guy fire and land and rack in some caps. Seen a guy sprinting towards the ghoul house double doors one time. Fired three rockets by the time the first one hit him. üòÇ Then the second knocked him down and third was the finishing blow. Was pretty fun. Although it's not safe to fire indoors. Like the MIRV Fatman. 
---
Which brings me to a weight related rant. No other weapons weigh more than a Fatman and a missile launcher and their ammunition. They should really be dealing insane amounts of damage since the weight factor offsets pretty well when with the perk reduction. 
---
VATS = Void of Actual Tactics or Strategy.
---
You want a Cryolator for that SICK BURN?
---
Bahaha, you do you, man.  You do you üëå.
---
Yeah,  the naked one basically just kept following them till they logged then followed me for a bit.  Very weird and annoying.
---
There were (and still are) plenty of people that are trying to "crush" the game, insisting on things being broken that are fixed long ago, always trying to convince people they won't like it etc, when it for many people really is enjoyable and close to bug-free. Those people are called "haters" and yes they do exist.
---
I‚Äôve been playing both since launched and also they are both MMOs. Fallout 76 is a sandbox MMO and Elder Scrolls a theme park MMO. I‚Äôm not trying to take anything away from ESO but it certainly was released in a buggy state where certain game design decision conflicted with your ability to play with friends due to the mega server. I actually don‚Äôt like the mega server personally because it tends to over populate areas with to many people which distracts from the immersion. Thats neither here nor there. The point was that ZeniMax online brought the game back after it died by sticking with it despite the hate and believe me it got every bit the hate fallout 76 did. People didn‚Äôt even give it any room to breath almost a year ago when summerset was released. It‚Äôs a definitely a good theme park MMO but it didn‚Äôt start off that way and also there‚Äôs no reason to think that in 5 years time fallout 76 won‚Äôt be considered amazing especially since they stuck with building the game on the same engine that they used for the single player game instead of revamping everything to fit the gene. 
---
Or allow the fans to properly fix them with mods. 
---
You can even see tiny green explosions from scorchbeast screeches, and a red glow from assaultron lasers from that distance.
---
Needless to say, its impressive
---
It's only rare if you don't know where to find it. However, there are some locations where it respawns every day, I think.
---
The only lv20 thing really bugs me though. Just... why? Why do that?
---
‚ÄúBe vewy, vewy, quiet, I‚Äôm hunting wabbits.‚Äù
---
....Clevy?
---
Fallout 76 is not an MMO. It's missing that first M
---
 "...given the sole points of evidence are insane ramblings..."
---
So basically... Reddit :)
---
Congratulations....You are The Wastelands, next top model!!!
---
Weightless sentinel how much? 
---
I think the Human NPC rumor started after someone found a human NPC in the secret developer room. Also, these could simply be vault dwellers in instanced dungeon-type content.
---
Yeah, that's just not true. There are people who point out flaws in the game, point out things that are broken that have been addressed...I run into "fixed" bugs every other day, pretty much. 
---
I've _never_ seen someone who would qualify as a hater, and I've looked at the people knee-jerk fanboys call haters and...it's just sad how fucking pathetic you lot can be. 
---
So many boarded and are still on the hate train for this game. I bought it on sale and I've enjoyed every minute of it. I waited till the new year to actually pick it up, Early February I think, as I remember the valentines stuff in the Atomic Shop.
---
I just wish I had more people to play with as the group I did roam with, have kinda gone to other games.
---
Always do üòâ
---
76 has one, linear quest-line, and a fucking pitiful smattering of side quests.
---
This "other players are the people, they're the companions, the raiders, the..." argument is so fucking old. Other players are other players, they've got their own shit to do, and in _no_ real way replace human NPC's. 
---
fair point
---
Ya, that's what I knew would happen.  Because it spawned inside a container, it means it's a very small chance of being a plan, and an even smaller chance of it being a BOS Combat Armor mod plan.
---
I'm roleplaying a Responder in Survival mode with a build dedicated to crafting.  I get murdered a lot, but it feels pretty awesome when someone doesn't just one-shot me and hangs around long enough for me to drop some goodies üòÅ.
---
What‚Äôs your offer?  
---
TBH the combined effects of deleting duped items on characters with multiple copies and "destruction only past 1500ish lbs" patches really helped.
---
I mean, yeah, you can't undo everyone running around with the same set of Sentinel Assassin and deathclaw gauntlets and BE Handmades. Everyone would be pissed if they did ("but muh hard earned caps bought that"), but those accounts with 900000lbs of stuff aren't around anymore as much
---
I do that too, and with things like the .50 cal MG and the minigun. Cos for short periods, they are fun as heck to fire but for the long run I'll stick to my rifles and shotguns.
---
With all the announcements of new stuff they haven't mentioned text chat once. Weird
---
You know what's fucking hilarious to me? Some of the people the fallout 76 fanboy club point at as being the worst "haters" amped this game so fucking hard it HURT early game. 
---
There were people who had issues with some aspects of this game before launch. I was one of them. Some of my biggest concerns turned out to be completely valid. It was rushed and unfinished, the lack of ability to host offline servers IS a massive fucking shortfall, and being forced to play with grifers WAS the worst part of this forced online experiment.  (for me, at least).
---
There are game breaking bugs in this game that were in fucking _skyrim_. Because they "could" fix something doesn't mean they "will".  Bethesda's track record of failing to address major, game breaking bugs in their content is well known, and criticism of a game for issues that are _known to exist_ is completely warranted. 
---
Don't listen to any of the negative bullshit. It's a great game. do a lot of questing early in as this will help with levelling.
---
Don't keep hold of stuff you don't need. it will only weight you down. 
---
Perk cards are a big thing so do some research online. If I had started my build at level 1 instead of level 50 it would have taken me far less time to have a super player. 
---
No the post is written because the game didn‚Äôt fail. Just because you stopped playing it doesn‚Äôt mean the game doesn‚Äôt have a community. If the game were dead you wouldn‚Äôt see level 100+ on every single servers or anyone that‚Äôs low level either. Not to mention Bethesda confirmed on Friday that the game has sold well and that their are millions of people playing it which I believe. I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs hard for you to believe but it‚Äôs the truth. 
---
Also it won‚Äôt take years to fix the game. They‚Äôve already fix most of the bugs and increased the server stability dramatically and they are rolling out content regularly now. The only thing missing at this point is activities to do and they are addressing that. By the time the game hits it one year anniversary it will have raids, dungeons, quest with choice and consequences, a bunch of new quest lines, player vending, a new backpack system, a new way to play and who knows what else. I don‚Äôt have the entire road map in front of me but the game has not failed and people are playing the hell out of it. 
---
Maybe like 3-4k?  
---
Wait, you seriously wanted downvotes and laughs at your expense? 
---
Eh, whatever gets your rocks off dude. 
---
The rule with gutsy's is to _ahem_ 'shoot them in the dick'... that is to say aim for their much more exposed and vulnerable thruster and not their more heavily armored heads. 60% of the time it works every time.
---
&gt;Then I went to the vendor at watoga and found the plans for the handmade rifle for sale 
---
Not to burst your bubble, but it's always for sale at the vendors now, since the Vendor Plan update a couple months ago.
---
&gt;Also, what is the value of the ultracite chest piece plan?
---
No real value.  The base item plans for the ultracite power armor can all be acquired from a computer on the top floor of Fort Defiance.  Only the Mod Plans have any value, and some of them are very common as well.
---
Can you fix the issue with the disconnecting sever especially when launching a nuke and fighting the Queen. The same goes with the silos. An hour of my life is lost. Just fix it or create a remedy for it! 
---
Weird.  sorry duder, that's all I can think of.  
---
Well said
---
That would be super cool. Use it in survival mode to let everyone know exactly where you are ;).
---
Also you have to purchase the game to play it. On my friends list I have 14 people who have purchased it which believe it or not is probably more people than who got Red Dead Redemption 2, certainly way more than Anthem or the division 2 at least on my friends list. 
---
Well damn I thought I was on to something there 
---
There are crossbows, they ain‚Äôt that good tho 
---
I ended up finding one tonight, thank you anyways
---
Thank you! 
---
Ya, one on one, or a couple on one, not bad.
---
Half a dozen suddenly running around a corner while you are running around Watoga one shotting Protectrons, and then a 2* Legendary Gutsy popping in while you are still trying to clear those out...
---
Gutsy shots x 5 = No amount of healing gonna fix that :)
---
I run around with a level 35 .44 pistol. I almost never get pistols. 
---
Would you mind if I ask you a couple of build-related questions? I've loved Charisma builds in the past and helping others; supposedly I hear they are meant to allow you to support your teammates a lot easier. What is your opinion on pure Charisma set-ups?
---
Your downvotes mean nothing. They are useless like Facebook likes. Your laughs fall on deaf ears. But you know my name. That‚Äôs what matters. You bring your hate. That‚Äôs what I want. Mmm delicious hate. 
---
They are, they're the "roaming traders" that are SO encumbered they can't stash it so ask people to come to them.
---
It only "eliminated" if someone chose to destroy the item, you can still trade/sell on those accounts.
---
Don't...there by far the most OP creatures with the worst item drops. Expend a ton of ammo waiting for it to land o my to get a few bit of crap and maybe a plan..If your lucky 
---
Are questions so frowned upon?
---
And if your icon was shown next to your name they'd probably sell more of the icons
---
Nice. Hopefully I‚Äôll find one someday. 
---
So you can use feedback for this stuff.   I'm sure it might be more effective if we got people who wanted chat to leave feedback asking for it.     It claims to be a direct line to devs.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42223/~/where-can-i-provide-feedback-for-fallout-76?
---
Fr though, already twice I had random people come in my bar, I usually give people I meet free drinks and both times this has happened I was returned with a bag of different chems and food as a thanks, really love the community surrounding this game.
---
Can You Be a Little Less Vague Please?
---
Brilliant strategy: if you can make something better, just make something else worse.
---
Maybe those of us who are asking for it just aren't getting enough traction, we need a bigger portion of the community to show that it isn't just a nice to have, it's a necessity
---
Huh?
---
Generally speaking as soon as someone starts calling themselves a god, I assume they're delusional and forget them shortly after. No one's going to remember shit about you, unless you make such a mess of yourself we see your name and shudder in disgust. 
---
Never even knew chainsaws were in the game... where can you typically find one?
---
What part do you not understand.
---
According to Todd they check this sub a lot
---
It did that to me once, I had to drop it and pick it back up.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
I got like 70 damage with a drill at one point. 
---
It absolutely sheds mobs, but players, no. You really need VATS to kill players, and the drill sucks at that.
---
Radstag does
---
Don't worry you could have bought that damn horn and thinking it's just bethesda's humor that they had a freaking mannequin-doll standing there blowing it.
---
Maybe that is why we don't have some of these must have features because they are too busy going thru everyone's posts instead of getting what is needed directly sent to them.
---
Put on your repair cards, look at repair costs on your gear.  Look at what it takes to craft the ammo you use.  Think about if you're planning on building a new base in the near future. No?  
---
Dump everything that isn't stupid rare that isn't used for repair on your gear down to 50 units. Most stuff that you DO use for repair can safely be kept at 100ish. The only stuff I keep past that are rare things (if I get more than 100 ballistic fiber, I won't be dropping that, as an example) or stuff to make ammo...I mass produce bullets, and if I still have north of a thousand steel/plastic/etc? I'll get rid of some. Some people recommend bulking and selling, personally I don't see the point. If you have a thousand plus steel/lead/plastic etc that you won't be using for ammo, consider selling it for caps over on /r/market76 
---
rare spawn, civil war reenactor. It's a random spawn though, in many places where other random spawns happen (I've seen reports of it near new gad, near overseer's camp, and I've personally seen it on the road north of Smith Farm)
---
That doesn‚Äôt matter to me. What does matter to me is my wife (who is smarter than all of us) giggling at the battle in the video and telling me it was awesome.
---
Then after some questions and I tell him posting the video anywhere will just draw hate from the gaming community, she disagrees. So I do. And it does. So I get to be right for once against my fixing to graduate, graduate level masters wielding psychology taught wife. 
---
Which is awesome. The fact that you think I give two shits if you‚Äôre disgusted by my name or not is hilarious to me. Who do you think you are? You‚Äôre fucking nobody to me.
---
Kthxbye 
---
Would love all of this! 
---
I imagine the quest giving to be easier said than done. It would much easier to pull off and create elaborate quest ideas with just quest instructions that are easy to read/obtain.  If we limit it to whatever Bethesda most code (they would have to have some kind of quest generator I think?) 5 wood means another quest that‚Äôs 5 steel. Or 10 firecaps but in one hour.) 
---
See where I‚Äôm going with this? 
---
And you‚Äôd better use a #2 pencil
---
What would the point of bows be 
---
Srsly tho, if you so skill, you need to be going at folks with a rolling pin or something.  They'll be like, "Haha look at this dude, aww, gonna make some pastry, guy?"  And then BAM, plot twist: they are the pastry.  You could make a series called, "CULLinary Arts with Apexigod."  Like if Bob Ross and Gordon Ramsey had a show together, except Quentin Tarantino is the executive producer.  And David Attenborough narrates, but talks like Samuel L. Jackson.
---
... ü§î‚òùÔ∏è 
---
My people will call your people.  We'll do lunch.
---
The nice players seem to vastly out number the crappy ones, especially now that there is more pvp incentive on the survival servers. 
---
I love giving stuff to lower level characters, it just makes me feel good. And I've recently started a new character, and she's had numerous people give her stuff. It's really awesome. 
---
Wish this game had guns and stuff. 
---
Don't forget that unlike FO4 FO76 had no speech options, Charisma will give you slightly better prices at vendors bit considering they have a very small cap pool and you can simply use 'Hard bargin' it not really worth it as far as vendor prices go.
---
Almost all perk cards in charisma benefit you if your in a team in one way or another but do nothing if your on your own. In FO76 you will be on your own a lot unless you have some close friends who will always play when you do. 
---
Strength and Intelligence should always have plenty of points in them, there are just so may awesome perk cards for them you can't really go wrong. 
---
It really depends what type of weapons you are going to use. 
---
Strength is a must for any melee build or shotgun build.
---
Perception benefits rifles, lockpicking etc
---
Endurance give you thing such as rad resistance and desiese resistance but I wouldn't go mad with endurance to be honest.
---
Charisma we have already covered
---
Intelligence benefits camp building, hacking and power armour also demolition expert which is a must if you like explosives
---
Agility and luck are pretty self explanitor when you look at them. 
---
you can equip and unequip perk cards as you need them so if you come to a locked door you can just activate your lockpick cards then switch back to what you had on before so it's pretty flexible.
---
What game breaking bug is in this game that was in Skyrim? I didn‚Äôt realize that Skyrim had any game breaking bugs considering it was praised by everyone and is often chosen by people as their favorite game ever. They rereleased it twice and it was a top selling game both times. So where‚Äôs the game breaking stuff? If there was in fact a bug that made the game unplayable then why on earth did people keep buying it? I don‚Äôt agree. I think theirs some fanaticism of people who pretend they know what they are talking about because some YouTuber acted like he did but he did so completely based on opinion and without any knowledge at all about how game design works. Then people took that and ran with it like it was some ultimate truth that skyrim, oblivion, morrowind fallout 3, fallout New Vegas, fallout 4 and fallout 76 sucked because they were all build using an upgraded version of the same engine. Like it has never been done before and isn‚Äôt actually the gold standard in developing games. Unreal and rockstar advance game engine are also upgraded version of what they‚Äôve been using for years to name a few. We can get into the halo franchise or destiny and how they are essentially been made with upgraded versions of the same engine for almost 20 years. This is how games are made. 
---
&gt;"X01 is better for nuke zones. T-51b is better for the rest"  
---
This is exactly what I've been doing. T-51 for everyday use, and swap out to X-01 at the nearest train station before entering the blast zone. I also have max White Knight and Lucky Break, so (almost) never have to repair my armor.  
---
Gut reaction: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. 
---
Glad to hear the pieces go in your inventory, I've been terrified of accidentally scrapping them for so long. 
---
They should make the spawn points like Battlefield has theirs, you select a point/trainstation and you spawn in that general location not directly at the building or the same part on the track.
---
That‚Äôs the best and funniest idea I‚Äôve heard in a long time lol that‚Äôs hilarious dude 
---
My players killed is broken, legendary working 
---
Meat Hook.  I suppose a super sledge or other 2 handed might be better, but a meat hook does more damage than a power fist, dc gauntlet, any of the swords or knives.  Not sure on the VFAST ones like the ripper.
---
Awesome! Great setup!
---
Definitely not had one kill me earlier today
---
This game could use some unofficial patches.
---
I have a bloodied Vats crit weightless missile launcher and even at max damage, its not that impressive. 
---
I was enamored with the idea of 4 homing rockets hounding scorchbeasts through the air. But lo and behold, even when it would be a direct hit, there would be no damage taken. This would occur as the scorchbeast would strafe, and effectively remove itself from the blast radius.
---
Fun! 
---
And you can pick there ammo back up.
---
And they don't make noise.
---
Legendary weapons and armor are random, been farming for Legendaries the past week or so and you'll get overwhelmingly shit items but you'll find some good ones. For example I found a instigating super sledge which practically kills most of the ghouls at the White Spring and a Two Shot Gauss Rifle. I do feel your pain on upgrading the Gauss Rifle tho, best bet is check in with the Enclave regarding mods since Gauss Rifles are hard to come by. Regarding the armor I'm still trying to figure that out myself, the Scout Armor from the Enclave is pretty good but I started using more legendary gear I find.
---
Rambow
---
Oh really? So Best Buy gives away free game bundles? That‚Äôs news to me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever walked into Best Buy in my life where they gave me anything for free. 
---
And they can't penetrate anything.
---
Truth be told I'd probably turn it off if this game had chat.
---
I'm happy for people to stalk my base if it means I get free stuff üòÖ
---
Oh, one more thing. The gaming community is toxic. If you use VATS, you have no skill. If you use a TSE weapon, you bought it off of eBay with mommy‚Äôs credit card. If you‚Äôre bloodied, you‚Äôre meta build and a sheep.
---
Gamers are sad little bitches. No matter what you do, they hate on it. Oh you use berry mentats? That‚Äôs cheating. Oh you use a fat man? That‚Äôs what a bitch does. Oh you use stealth boys? Scared huh bitch?
---
It never ends. I do me. You may not care about me and that‚Äôs fine! I don‚Äôt NEED you to care about me. But if you‚Äôre on PlayStation and the day comes when I kill you, you can make all these excuses but I still killed you.
---
In the worlds of Dominic Toretto..it doesn‚Äôt matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning‚Äôs winning.
---
Adieu. 
---
I only came across one asshole on adventure mode since. I'm so glad they have their own server to destroy each other.  
---
There‚Äôs a fun documentary out there about that game and how it failed and it‚Äôs pretty interesting. 
---
Could you elaborate on those cosmetics please?
---
I knew one person to buy RDR, and he thought it sucked. Everyone liked God of War however. 
---
I got your guestbook right here in this brown paper bag next to the Propaganda Flyer and the spoiled biofluid.
---
You mean X01 chest&gt; everything else?
---
I've also found a legendary Grahm.  This was around a month ago, though.  I'd love it, if him being legendary would increase rare plan chances.
---
Just because its better now doesnt mean it didnt fail homie. I'm hesitant to play it again
---
Huh, sounds good. The other builds sound admittedly too easy for the type of player I am, and I imagine in the endgame you'll be forced to work with other players to achieve your goals easier. The reason I said that I knew I'd be alone in the first place is because I'm not sure if players will be too friendly to me or even want to ally with me.
---
Regardless, birds of a feather fly together. I'll try my best to play a Charisma character for my first build, because in the endgame I read that they are considered extremely valuable.
---
Not that it always works as the only people who wanna pvp in adventure mode are people with such OP ar our and builds you cant damage them
---
There are few players that still pvp in advent mode rather than survival. Most of the time I just leave them with a wanted tag rather than killing them because taking off their radar is acgood punishment :) Most are nice players now as the maniac ones go over to survival :)
---
I completely agree. Why the fuck does Bethesda think a drill is worthy of being deemed legendary. Some effects are terrible too. If I have a legendary, it shouldn't have a downside effect. Its also not that hard to guarantee 3 star drops from 3 star enemies.
---
...wow. Ok, yes, skyrim had game breaking bugs. Every major quest line have bugs in the versions that are out today. You can get "stuck" in the elder scroll in the version they're charging $60 for on the switch, just as an example. 
---
Bugs from the dragons ended up in the scorch beasts early game. 
---
I've been playing fallout games since 1. I've been playing bethesda games for years. 
---
Bethesda makes some of my most loved games. But they are _shit_ at taking care of them. There are mods for skyrim, fallout, that fix THOUSANDS of bugs, from minor texture issues to game breaking bugs. 
---
But I'm done. You've convinced yourself that bethesda can do no wrong, which makes you a MASSIVE part of why bethesda can turn out broken garbage like  76 was at launch without any real concern. 
---
Enjoy your state of delusion. 
---
I got [this plan](https://imgur.com/8f75kXL) yesterday and just stared at it in disbelief.
---
The video isn't the issue. Your post? Your username? Your general "I'm a fucking douchebag" attitude? That's what gets you "hate" dude. 
---
I'm the ass that goes in with nothing and looks for someones camp put my camp next to theres and just constantly respawns and runs at them to waste there ammo 
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the Xbox one x bundle which isn‚Äôt free by the way could it be that Microsoft and Bethesda have some sort of written agreement and that they are in fact still making fallout 76 Xbox one X bundles? Especially considering the fact that a large portion of a game development expensive is advertisement. The game has a cash store in it so the more units they push out the more money they will make. It‚Äôs pretty simple. Fortnite is entirely free but yet has made a billion dollars in the past year. Maybe that‚Äôs the strategy. 
---
The missile launcher has always been a favorite in Fallout for me, and it‚Äôs a solid weapon even now with the right perks. Surprisingly effective in pvp as well. I enjoy it so much I have to craft my own missiles- if you don‚Äôt want yours send them my way lol
---
I have my CAMP east of New Gad on a hill and there's often people's CAMPs in the Basin, so if you move there you'll often have neighbors.
---
I just bought it this morning.... 
---
Yes! Not as many jerks.
---
Yeah but it's a ripper. Don't get me wrong, this is a good thing to give to the vendor when he gets here but that's about it.
---
But according to Todd in the future, survival will be seasonal... So say welcome back whitespring griefers in Adventure mode. 
---
Saved- power armour guide
---
But still not as strong as the buzz blade or ripper without any mods when they're over repaired and at 45 or 50. All it needs is a higher level cap. Why they left it at 20 is beyond me
---
Something to keep in mind when tallying 'legendaries' for the weekly challenge: Only 1\*, 2\* and 3\* 'starred' legendary mobs that you take down yourself count. Unstarred legendaries do NOT count. Legendaries you tag but do not put the final bullet in yourself do NOT count.
---
While you can try and farm the much more rare starred legendaries the same way you farm plain vanilla legendaries, it's better to try and rack up your tally by hitting up events with reliable legendary spawns. This means Horde events, Leader of the pack and Uranium Fever. Sometimes the Enclave events will trigger legendaries as well. (BotStop, Dropped Connection, It's a Blast, etc.)
---
Proof that it's possible: https://i.imgur.com/74TKRpp.jpg
---
Happy hunting.
---
I have such a sweet furious fire rate crossbow. One day I‚Äôll try to do something with it. 
---
Yeah it is a real shame with BW and the rest of the devs under EA, so much talent squashed under greedy practices and cut corners.
---
The map in the Div2 is open world, It seems smaller than other AAA titles but it's actually pretty big considering you're always on foot. Regions are also based on lvl (lower ones scale). From what I understand a new tough enemy faction is released once the last mission is completed.
---
I have a level 40 furious ripper. Why cant I have a that but a chainsaw
---
They‚Äôre 0.2 with Ordnance Express on. And you can carry a limitless pile of every grenade at once too (@ 0.05 weight)
---
You'll have to check in with the vendors if you are looking for the Combat Rifle plans, don't remember the price off the top of my head however. Not sure about the plasma grenades or the deep pockets plans though, sorry.
---
All those mutations finally catching up with you. 
---
So much yes!
---
You might want to note that, currently, the Targeting HUD mod causes memory problems that eventually cause the game to crash or lock up.
---
Hey you‚Äôre supposed to be level 21 before you can drink alcohol. Are you admitting to dealing to minors?
---
Nope. It's about 50/50 on the 'splosion and generally happens instantly but there can be up to about a half second delay sometimes.
---
They are not supposed to that way anyway
---
There are many NPCs, they are just not human.  Personally, I'd prefer more events like Fasnacht.  It was fun to work with people.  Maybe even some evil Fasnachts for the Survival mode.  
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
The basement of the Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast south of Whitesprings has one in the basement, the barn at the Rangers District Office and the hardware store in Clarksburg
---
Totally this ^
---
It feels so good to help out and you get a little bit lighter to boot! I am Lvl 103 on PS4. I made a friend over the weekend, Lvl 38. He was mentioning how he wanted to have a nice camp made of brick so I purchased him the plans from Watoga Train Station. It made his play session and made me feel great to know we are fostering a great community here in this game!
---
I play with friends but stay out of parties for 2 reasons. I‚Äôm low health bloody and teams prefer radsponge, and because I‚Äôm low health bloody and need the 20% reduction in damage. This card is perfect, overly generous if I‚Äôm being honest. This card could have not existed and I‚Äôd live with it, but glad it‚Äôs an option as it helps a lot. 
---
There are tons of side quests?  Do you even play the game?
---
Yes, I know. Apologies for not being literal enough. I meant human NPCs. But yeah, more events like that would be great. It was fun and really got groups together to complete. Best event yet
---
Like, not identical.  I'd call it an accurate statement.
---
This was a great surprise! Thank you Todd Howard.
---
Luck has nothing to do with it.  Go slower.
---
I know this post is old but if anyone is still looking for the gas canisters, go into the workshop room in the basement of Poseidon Energy Plant and behind a door is 4 or so refrigerators each have both ruptured and unruptured variants.
---
I do! I love the Big BOOM BOOMS baby!
---
Awesome, thanks all! So in that case if anyone has speed demon and marsupial serums for sale on Xbox please let me know!
---
I'm XB1 but thanks anyway dude!
---
I haven‚Äôt done a white springs nuke with those spawns In a while. I‚Äôm on PS4 so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs any different but I have been there 4-5 time in the last 10 days and like you said that mobs were brutal and not even worth it.
---
But if they hot fixed this and the spawns are decently numbered again I might try. 
---
Maybe you can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not really a weapon, but a prop? 
---
No sense of humor. 
---
Omg what an asshole. I'm sorry. I had a guy killing me over and over the other night. He was stalking me to my camp from Charleston but I logged out so he couldn't destroy anything. I was able to kill him once though. First time I've ever killed another player in fallout. I'm level 23.
---
Sigh... this is what I get for not checking reddit more... I have the card and have been running around getting the codes too as I thought I needed them all based on the stupid quest prompts....
---
YES. Thank God! Been missing that since Fo4.
---
It feels so good to help out and a great way to manage your inventory. You get a little bit lighter to boot! I am Lvl 103 on PS4. I made a friend over the weekend, Lvl 38. He was mentioning how he wanted to have a nice camp made of brick so I purchased him the plans from Watoga Train Station. It made his play session and made me feel great! We are fostering a great community here in this game! The community around this game is one of a kind!
---
My state of delusion? Lol okay whatever buddy. I think I‚Äôve laid out clearly why I disagree with you but you‚Äôve instead base you argument on YouTubers. Believe what you want but I‚Äôm going to believe the game developer over some person whose entire income is based on views. 
---
A friend visited Paris some years ago when we were playing a lot of Battlefield 3, and he had this familiar feeling one day. He snapped some photos and when he got home, he figured out why:
---
Seine Crossing is literally a 1:1 scale version of the area around the Seine in Paris. 
---
I once made my parents house as a map for Quake (1), but this is next level.
---
Imagine getting paid to do this, I'd do it for free if I had the time!
---
I did Whitespring on Thursday or Friday and it was awful...so long for respawns, didn't play yesterday. That's why I was so surprised today seeing mobs and people everywhere. Fortunately, it was an amazing group with everyone letting folks tag legendaries and wave folks over for them. :)
---
Nice! I didn't know this. Thank you for sharing!
---
Working as intended. 
---
Might do another post with comparisons of the game vs IRL of all the citites!
---
Just finished this earlier 
---
Last blow counts only.
---
Workshop defense spawned for me
---
AWOL armaments , sons of Dane 
---
I got a spawn that 2 3 star were fighting each other unfortunately only one counted but I did it 25 
---
Had a similar experience today. It really helped get me going and allowed me to dive right in. So cool to see the higher levels helping us newbies out. 
---
And sack Hood and going cannibal is how i like to greet my customers on occasion before taking üòÇ but really
---
Worked perfectly, thanks!
---
Ive been getting those ones alot recently 
---
Really? https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_quests There's not much here that isn't a two minute or less "quest" such as "craft a weapon" Or "retrieve your lost loot". 
---
There are some good ones. The Order of Mystery line is great. Miner Miracles. 
---
Well sometimes you find them fighting anyway... I think you just effected my head canon. 
---
I personally seem to get heavy guns very often, and neither of my two characters use them or hold them in their inventory.  I got three gatling guns between today and yesterday, a flamer, an auto grenade launcher and an LMG earlier in the week.
---
I'd say 70% of my drops are armor.  I wear a mixed set of "sneak" and "-15% damage while standing still" gear, all of which are 3star and 3/5 are vanguard.  I don't think the game is trying to upgrade my armor, but who knows.  My other character basically lives in his power armor, but has a full set of weightless, ultra light modded marine armor "just in case".  I feel like my loot is basically the same whether I'm playing my sniper or my power armor sledge swinger.
---
By far the rarest weapons for me to find are rifles.  I think I find maybe 1-2 a week, and a decent one maybe once a month.  I specifically use rifles, so if the loot tables are supposed to be giving me what I have equipped, it's not working very well.  Two handed melee weapons are similarly rare for me.
---
I was on a streak for a while where I was getting tons of unarmed weapons.  Death tambo's, deathclaw gauntlets, mole miner gauntlets, meat hooks, etc etc.  Lucky for my friend, she's an unarmed build so I just kept throwing 3star furious, instigating, bloodied and vampire gear her way.  She returned the favor with a couple really nice pistols.
---
Seriously.  Stupid fanboys having fun and enjoying shit.  You need to wake up and hate things, to spread your hate.  Then you won't be so pathetic.  You can spend your spare time trashing stuff like Drackar and be cool again.
---
So... how did you find this thread if you are not a fallout 76 fan?  Are you seriously reading a reddit for a game you hate so you can talk about how much you hate it?   And that means your opinion is worth what again?
---

---
Closest thing I could find, that's the Hindenburg 6 hours before going up in flames in New Jersey!
---
so where can i find the chainsaw dual blade mod?
---
And a 9mm can't penetrate steel plate but I have seen it happen in this game.
---
I may pick it up eventually. The game play looks pretty cool if nothing else.
---
Yeah but with other weapons, you don't need to invest in perks to make it decent to at least carry
---
I don't like survival at all but to mess with the person in first place i hid in the enclave bunker with a chameleon leg piece and i was second place for longest survived and he passed me about thirty times it was amazing when he raged quit cause he couldn't find me 
---
Don‚Äôt write this here or anywhere for that matter .... 
---
Don't dismiss a good ripper :)
---
I'd like a fast travel/spawn mat, every time I enter the game if I leave at my camp I end up glitching into the side of the mountain below my CAMP
---
Well, here's the thing with chainsaw weapons, and it's not really THAT great, but when they are repaired over 100% they gain massive bonus damage. I have a bloodied Mr Handy Buzzblade that does over 300 damage a tick at 200% durability. It's absolutely shreds everything, if I touch an enemy they die. But once it gets below 150% it starts to dramatically drop in damage, and it's not that great at 100%.
---
Yeah I know 
---
You can enjoy a game, play a game, and still see that it's flawed, that it needs work, and that it has legitimate issues that deserve attention. 
---
It's not either-or. You don't have to be a fan of the game or a "hater". Legitimate criticism isn't "hate". 
---
I've played a fair bit of this game. I have a level 140 character. I've seen a shitload of bugs. I've seen stability issues, I've seen poor decisions. 
---
Wow SWTOR was so cool at first... them they just eviserated it and it was like watching a vivisection.  Would love to buy a single player translation of that though.
---
West tec, Harpers Ferry, watoga , Whitespring, robo tec, sugar cove 
---
No, I've based my argument on _personal experience_. Including hundreds of hours playing multiple games in this franchise and by this publisher, including significantly more time figuring out ways around game breaking bugs than I care to think about. 
---
The game developer's entire income is based on people buying the game. 
---
I haven't crashed in weeks...  seems stable to me.
---
Two replies? Jesus dude, the edit button exists for a reason.
---
I get you wanna play fanboy here at all costs, but the game just didnt sell like you wanted it to. Get over it.
---
That's the thing, there is no "good" ripper. Reactive plates, electrically charged, and unstable isotope will kill you easily if you're at a low enough health to actually hurt anything. Also swing speed doesn't affect very fast weapons.
---
Lmfao this is great! I never thought about it until now. Now I‚Äôm just picturing a bear with a mustache, a harness, and cop hat or something!
---
Song use contract.
---
 Section 1
---
1.1 can't have the song on more than one virtual station.
---
1.2 can't have players choose if they want to hear that song or not
---
Section 2
---
2.1 can't have more than one player listing to a song at once.
---
2.2 can't...you get the point.
---
I agree but I DO remember gamer tags!
---
This is where the player trading community comes into play.  Someone will want that ripper, trade you for something that upgrades what you're currently using, you're able to hunt down legendaries more efficiently, gather more desirable gear, make more trades that result in more lucrative stuff, and eventually you're kitted out with the high end gear that you're looking for.
---
Reading and being aware of the market is also very helpful.  When bloodied unarmed builds became the meta, I'd hang on to any fairly decent \*\*\* mole miner gauntlet, power fist, etc and had more trade leverage for what I wanted because of market fluctuation and trends.  People tend to get desperate to get in on some new action and will over-value trending gear and undervalue what was working great last week.
---
Wait until the build du jour becomes chainsaws, buzz blades and rippers, then do your trade for the bloodied/explosive gun you've been wanting.
---
If I remember correctly, dataminers found normal bows to either be scrapped ideas or future content. 
---
Cultist and radstag hide outfit i think
---
Where do we get the grognak outfit tho? Saw someone with it at the parade
---
You could do that on PS4 with a glitch. And yes. you could use the same glitch to make a minigun shoot MIRVs
---
It will crash your game to PS4 menu, but the last thing you see will be glorious destruction.
---
It was bugged for me tonight until I picked one up in the wild.
---
Exactly. Like if fallout had a character like this it'd instantly be my fav npc. 
---
I prefer my hazmat suits.... prototype...
---
That I can get down with. It sounded like you were going rogue out of frustration. 
---
Yep
---
It wasn‚Äôt just that, there was so much that went wrong like the whole bag situation and the shitty Nuka Liquor, IMO the game is much better than people give it credit for but it was surrounded with a ton of controversy
---
Good  to know. I managed to get the BoS plan for the Combat helmet from dismantling gear a while back. Haven't seen anything since...would love to get the rest of the BoS paint. 
---
Today though, I found an interesting Plan, a Vault-Tec University Jumpsuit. It's an underarmour same as the 76 jumpsuit, but instead of 76 it's got VT on the back. Never knew such a thing existed. I found it in the shed of the train-yard just north of Whitesprings.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/72h4aIx](https://imgur.com/a/72h4aIx) 
---
Yes there are two different ones. One days it's going to explode and the other you got.
---
It changes depending on the stock you have modded , some are black others are camo
---
I‚Äôm right there with you. Well if people are having bad experience then I feel for them but I‚Äôm not at all. 
---
9mm can definitely pen a step plate.
---
Depends on the thickness of the steel.
---
Did they say specifically that it would be with the vendor update? I saw "at a later date" but nothing specific about when.
---
If so, that's awesome.
---
The problem with 76 is that they released way too soon. Imagine if they released the game at this time? The changes and content we got since November. Early buyers had the worst of it.
---
Sometimes it doesn't work but restarting the game fixes it.
---
Yea it was cool. I wish they would have kept at making it. Seems like such a waste. 
---
I'd personally be very disappointed if Bethesda makes WS a player hub.
---
While it's relatively intact/pristine aesthetic make it standout from the surroundings of the wasteland, it's boring. 
---
Every little shack, campsite, tent that lies unmarked on the map oozes character and tone in comparison. 
---
I don't want a player hub conveniently preserved for us by rich people's robots. A hub that is chosen simply for it's cap/item farming potential. I don't want the player hub to be a good damn upscale shopping mall. Even when people build camps near it, it's rarely for the aesthetic, it's because "it's flat" or to turret farm. How immersive. 
---
I'd want it to reflect the tone and feeling of people struggling to carve out a small safe haven in the wasteland. Slightly cobbled together, but getting there. 
---
I don't need my vendor bot in some chic little shop with it's unbroken windows. I want my vendor bot in a shack or a lean to, with a spray painted sign. Yeah it looks like it's going to fall apart around him, but he's our God damn vendor, and we love him. 
---
There's a reason people love Grahm and Chally. Or like Rosie. Or have yelled at their TV as a super mutant attacks dogmeat. Or any other of the beloved misfits and outcasts from the wastelands in 76 or previous games. They have character. They're out in the shit just like us. 
---
You know what now one ever "God, the robot security at white springs are just so endearing, I feel so connected to their former elitist rich 1% owners"
---
I'll take Bartertown over the Hilton any day. 
---
*&gt;scrapped my fully modded out X-01 Power Armor (complete with Calibrated Shocks, Stealth Boy, and the Nuka Quantum paint job).* 
---
*&gt;only the frame got scrapped* 
---
Seems legit
---
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think BioWare is going to make another old republic game although I think they should. That game was the most expensive game ever made I believe and they didn‚Äôt make the money back.
---
Prepare yourself for kids spamming, it usually happens (as seen CSGO and other games)
---
You da real MVP, man. 
---
Agreed ! We should appreciate that it gets better but never forget the mess it was.
---
they can't update it. Bethesda disabled a core API, without it it's basically impossible to have a chat mod
---
No, Patch 6 disabled an API that allowed two-way internet access for mods. That was the only way that mod worked. Without it... nope, it's dead.
---
It could likely be a reward for Survival Mode challenges, like the ones we get now.
---
I'll be there in 10 mins
---
You need to learn what MMO means 
---
You get a whole set after finishing that quest 
---
Shoot after hitting it 
---
There are 4 spawns in the game, still locked at 20, no random loot drop and no legendary. I still consider that rare, but I take your point.
---
I found an instigating rocket launcher it‚Äôs not bad, but I still don‚Äôt use it
---
There is also another near Top of the world.
---
I‚Äôm only level 30 but whenever I see a low level I try to help them out by giving them stims/food and water/plans that I already know. Would make my week if I knew someone appreciated it even half as much as u did :‚Äô) 
---
No problem, thanks for the heads up
---
Monster Hunter World has flair guns that have a similar purpose to how your describing. I don't understand why video game companies don't borrow more good ideas from one another.
---
I am waiting for me accidentaly scrapping my Fasnacht beret. If it happens, i will send my finger in box to Todd.
---
Sorry for not understanding...what are dupes?
---
You are fanboying so hard you‚Äôre being absolutely and thoroughly brainless about just how bad it was, not just ‚Äúsome bugs‚Äù, massive oversights and full on trying intentionally scam people (with the canvas bags) until they were publicly called out and outright illegal
---
When it comes to resources, other players can take them.
---
Putting a lock on things will get them (other players) a bounty if they pop it.
---
Purifiers and extractors are not instanced.
---
Agreed. It reminds me of bullies in RL. They are the coward losers that always drop out first when dealing with real pressure. They enjoy manipulating the weak rather than be a champion for them.
---
I did the exact same thing in Adventure mode awhile ago with my Excavator set. I was scrapping things in my inventory, the game lagged and shuffled all the items around and made me dismantle my frame instead. Luckily, my  friend not 3 feet away had left a spare frame he was getting rid of. The second I realized I dismantled it I said "FUCK!" then sighed in relief as I noticed I was overencumbered  andseen all the parts in my inventory.
---
He‚Äôll never be the head of a major corporation 
---
Price? 
---
Ty for your sacrifice 
---
Can we get a link? Can‚Äôt find in on Youtube 
---
Throw an offer and how many stars and level
---
Keep in mind where train stations and red rockets are. You can access your stash box at these locations. If one is nearby, go crazy and grab all the weapons you can. At these locations will also be a work bench where you can break them down to learn mods. Find the highest level/best condition weapons or armor pieces usable and break down the rest. Until you're level 50 everything is disposable so don't get attached. 
---
All my friends bought it and dropped it after a few weeks because it gets old and the end game mechanics suck. There is a reason why it was half off right after release.
---
Two VTU suits spawn in the Frat house next to Morgantown High, it's got a red door.
---
The hat's a random reward from Responder Events.
---
That is every druggie I have ever met or known in my life....always trying to drag people in to there addictions
---
I love my greaser character, he looks so fresh
---
well you learn something new every day then, this whole time I thought they were individual 
---
Whoops, eorry, I misread that. Thought you were selling. My bad.
---
yea I knew the bit about the wanted but I didn't know about the resources working like world loot
---
Awesome :)
---
Np
---
Thank you so much! 
---
But isnt it duck season?
---
;)
---
Fatman is probably only weapon that would oneshot you in non-legendary version  on survival server.
---
I have weightless rocket launcher waiting for some patch.
---
Now i am having fun with Crushing blow (granate launcher from survival weekly challenge)
---
They are still better than minigun for example.
---
Man.....
---
A bunch of mines dropped at the entrance of an interior?
---
.......
---
Damn.
---
There are two fusion generators behind the house and the workshop. There are power connectors on the outside walls.
---
I ran into a rocket happy Super Mutant in Harper's Ferry the other day. I decided to have fun with him and I broke out my Auto-Grenade launcher and just peppered him and his buddies.
---
low health build with a bloody/twoshot/instigating missile launcher will lay down some hurt. Just don't try it on (flying) Scorchbeasts unless you're very well practiced. There seems to be a delay before the explosion goes off and with how fast SB can move in the air, you'll frequently get SB outflying the explosions and taking no damage.  If you're good at aiming/timing, though, you can have some epic shots.
---
Try jumping to a different server
---
Thanks :)
---
Maybe but highly unlikely, if it's a prop then it shouldn't be usable like the Silver Submachine gun prop you can find in fallout 4 that goes in misc inventory.
---
I tried ESO last year. Was mildly entertained enough to pay 10 bux for it in case I wanted to play it further. THough it felt like a generic mmo with some elder scrolls flavor, certainly didn‚Äôt feel elder scrolls to me. Good thing I didn‚Äôt pay more, I haven‚Äôt touched it since. Fallout 76 on the other hand grew on me. I liked it when it came out but I love it now. And it feels like fallout. Except with other players.  
---
Yeah they do last longer, but they are still weaker than balistic weapons.
---
Sounds great :) 
---
I did this not once...but twice yesterday with my Auto grenade launcher, I think I hit  a pixel of the broken wall I was using for cover.
---
Thank you! It took me forever to come across the plan for modern couches... 
---
I‚Äôm still salty that I missed that quest. 
---
I'm someone who quit and still reads the sub because I'm waiting for the day the game becomes great. The game did not sell well in any sense of the word. It "sold well" because it was being bundled as a free giveaway with literally any purchase at any national store so those stores could get their pre-purchased stock off the shelves. I had a lot of fun, for like 2 months, before I realized bugs were being fixed at a rate of 1 per week when there were 100 that I would consider "game-breaking". Every public announcement or patch note was a cringe-worthy affirmation of my opinion. I pictured the development staff as 2-3 dudes struggling to figure out WTF everyone was complaining about while breaking 2 things for everything they fixed. From what I understand, a ton of the stuff is still not fixed: accidentally scrapping valuable items, power armor bugs and server instability, for example. Absolutely no sense of urgency was applied to any problem. The duping bug took like a year to fix even though it's been known for like a decade. Great concept, but one of the worst executions known to software development. I still hope that the dev team multiplies by 50 so I can enjoy this game again in the future.
---
The only thing really 100%, yours is your stash.
---
Some things are individual.
---
Like the trick-or-treater, civil war reenactor corps, crashed satellite/cargobot instances.
---
I just recently purchased the game and have run into nothing but people over level 100 offering to help or craft items for me.
---
I usually decline as I like the reward for grinding but it's been nice.
---
There was one kid who kept attacking me so I killed him, but left his stuff.
---
That‚Äôs really nice. It looks like it belongs in the game even. I‚Äôm on ps4 and I hope i run across it one day. 
---
I mean, isn't that what Fireproof+Dense are for?
---
well, it finally fixed itself.  unknowingly did a sneak attack and it resolved itself.  weird.  2 days and nothing.
---
I haven't found the cap but I found two VTU outfits in the frats as mentioned (one spawns in the first "party" house and a second in the "nerd" house) and a surprise one in Vault-Tec University, I didn't realize that last spot was a random spawn but apparently it is.
---
That is a nice shot!
---
Yeah, but it's also a warning signal. It's devious as hell! I hate the idea..... But, damnit...
---
that happens to me as well, every time i have more than one variant of the same weapon. even if i have two different legendaries they‚Äôll still keep unfavoriting and changing places, same thing with just regular weapons. guess we can only hope for a fix in the near future
---
ok, thanx all.
---
I boutght TSE minigun months ago, i thought it would shred SBQ, but it is actualy super weak, so i let it on my mule. Now when there is survival mode, i carry this minigun, not because it can kill people (it actualy can't), but because it shreds camps like paper boats. Most fun ever!
---
There‚Äôs really no point. Locking extractors and purifiers will keep people out, but they pass so rarely and the items restock so quickly that even if someone takes something you‚Äôre not likely to notice. 
---
If someone wants to destroy your camp, locks aren‚Äôt going to stop them and may encourage them. 
---
I always assumed they were like the steamer chests or other containers except you know what you'll find 
---
Thanks! I've got many more good ones, finally just dumped my PS4's storage folder onto my computer, I'm gonna put together an album of my best shots since launch.
---
There's that Pioneer Scout Content upcoming too...
---
So MMOs aren't your thing. It's good you aren't playing one.
---
This sub make my ass speechless
---
I could spend hours just doing that. I was obsessed with building houses in Sims 2 as a teenager and now that obsession comes out again in Fallout haha
---
How do you send messages? 
---
I like the idea, but not at White Spring with the constant nuking. 
---
Sounds like my wife the photog. She only plays to take photos. 300 hours, only lvl 40. All she does is look for photo ops.
---
How do you keep them from burrowing again?
---
Welp know what I'm doing tomorrow after work lol
---
I don't think that's going to apply in this case though, since the frame isn't painted.
---
Thanks! I hope you do too :)
---
Imagine downvoting this comment, imagine disagreeing with the idea of someone getting a full game for their money
---
Will this work for lower ranked players?
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll check it out :)
---
hahah basically, yeah I've just thought of myself as a travelling wasteland photographer, only level 62 on my main duder.
---
Great guide.  I have a question can you get plans for power armour by scrapping the various parts?
---
I have been trying but no luck yet. Should i sell to vendors the excess instead?
---
Well it would be inside. As I support the idea of the Whitesprings becoming a hub. But if not the Whitesprings, I would suggest Charleston.
---
I had two blow up in my face. I even had a Super Mutant explode. 
---
Only if a higher level player shows up first. Enemies should scale with whatever player shows up first, but there are exceptions. 
---
They don't work well at all in pvp servers. It's almost humorous how everyone thought this would be the end game meta but they got fooled.    
---
 Cav is only useful for melee builds, which are less than useless in survival. Sentinel is not nearly as useful as people think because standing still under fire just isn't viable, especially when that next shot is going to stagger and your sitting there just waiting for it. 
---
I suspect the market has quietly died down on these items because their value was more theoretical than practical
---
What about fixing Adrenal Reaction so it doesn't break with Strange in Numbers while they're at it? :(
---
They‚Äôre probably not. Too many people ruining my immersion. Feels more like you‚Äôre just playing to keep upping your power vs playing any story. And one thing I‚Äôll give fallout 76 over eso is that because it‚Äôs not an mmo it feels way more like a fallout game then eso feels like an elder scrolls game. As I said, it felt like an mmo with some elder scrolls flavor. 
---
And a fallout mmo would completely kill the atmosphere of fallout. It would be worse than your normal mmo on that (where it just feels like story is a weak excuse to go level up. I level up because I want to get further in the game. But for me the goal is not to level up, that‚Äôs a boring goal and it seems with mmos that‚Äôs really the only goal). 
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one noticing this ugh. My deathclaw gauntlets do the same thing and I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone say anything about it so I‚Äôve just been like oh well another day, another bug. 
---
Too bad crossbows don't have any good mods to make them great.
---
Who give a shit? I mean honestly. I enjoy the game. I‚Äôm sorry you lack the social skills to not be an asshole but that‚Äôs not my problem. 
---
I was already in bed, lights out when I saw this post. Ok, so reading reddit isn‚Äôt exactly helping me get sleepy.  I just jumped up, logged in and got my cap. Thanks for this!
---
K
---
The problem is there are only so few skins for weapons. One skin for pump shotty, hunting rifle, lever action, that‚Äôs all. There‚Äôs a chrome for minigun but who would use that. 
---
The inside isn‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs the severe radiation you have to go through to get inside. 
---
But yeah, Charleston, Sutton, Grafton, Flatwoods. Really they could have a post office in every town that would work for this system. 
---
A post office system works great too! Maybe you could put items in there that would be sent to your bank. Maybe there's one at every train station.
---
This is great 
---
I can't tell if this is about drug use in fallout, or some horrible person actually being a jerk about those struggling with drug addictions. I sincerely hope the former. 
---
Pardon my flu and medication but what is TSE?
---
Worst than pipeweapons but easiest to make.
---
Just tried and you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôll scrap the pa frame and remove the painted pieces. That‚Äôs sucks. At least it‚Äôll prevent accidental drops with its warning message 
---
In the Cranberry Bog, there‚Äôs a guaranteed spawn point at the Ranger District Office. Look in the shed behind the main building.
---
Two Shot explosive 
---
Two shot explosive weapon
---
Hmm, its not working for me.  I drink the liquor, then I eat the spoiled food, and it doesn't complete.  Maybe I have a buff preventing the effect from occurring?
---
I've been stuck at 42/76 for ages, but tonight when Biv gave me the quest to craft ballistick bock, unlocking that made my challenge ding. So.... yeah it's bugged to hell but it's possible to (somehow) complete it bugged.
---
..... yeah we know 
---
There is no immersion in 76 unless you consider robots and terminals as ground breaking story telling. 
---
I doubt you even played ESO past the tutorial area.
---
That would be even easier. Just add whatever fallouts version of a fedex box is
---
Some hospitals have national pull. Think of the Cleveland Clinic for example.
---
Agree with all of them. 1 and 4 are the same problem and bugged I think. The load in invincibility they added only works correctly at valt 76, have tested it there a bit and it works great, quite a few campers have found out the hard way. If they are able to fix load in for the whole map like vault 76 it would fix #1 and #4. Just that alone would be huge for survival. 
---
Appalachia Express?
---
My main is lvl 271, playing since beta. I've just recently been working on leveling up an alt strictly for survival (because MAN losing nearly 600 caps every time I get killed sucks ass) and remembering how tough things were in the beginning. So here's my advice:
---
Don't worry too much about your build starting out. Grab what you can grab. Don't bother fixing armor, resources will be thin; armor up, of course, but swap it out rather than fix. 
---
Stay in level-appropriate areas. The map is specifically designed so that low levels and high levels can enjoy the same map but definitely not the same areas, explore the whole of The Forest before you start venturing out and you'll be level 10 or 20 with some decent experience in no time.
---
Do events and take workshops. Holding workshops opens you up to PvP though so scrap your junk and stash often. Other than that, it's a minor inconvenience in exchange for lots of plans and XP.
---
Walk. It's tempting to fast travel a lot once you get stronger and find more locations but you miss out on random encounters, enemies, and stuff. I wish I hadn't been in such a rush early on, I was camped in the Cranberry Bog by like level 40 and feel I missed out on the true Fallout experience of simply wandering the wastes.
---
Essential perks for early on: Pharma Farma, Green Thumb, Picklock probably helps too. There are lots of perk-building guides out by now that I wasn't able to use at beta due to the game being so new so take advantage of them if you're so inclined.
---
Last tip: there's a free disease cure fountain at the Whitespring resort, which you will visit eventually and probably spend way way too much time at. It's just outside of the golf course, kitty corner to the tennis court, under a big gazebo. You're going to be diseased A LOT, this will be your best friend once you're high enough level to hit Whitespring on your own.
---
Good luck and welcome to Appalachia!
---
I carry a rifle and shotty, make sure they are both equipped after logging in, shoot a few ferals from a distance as they get closer swap to shotgun and... fists are up, lets go toe toe, and this can be with in a few minutes of equipping both 
---
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong with you Vault Dwellers whom haven‚Äôt seen it‚Äôs glory. The Red Glow will be your salvation, for when you see it you know that he approaches. When Appalachia is crying for help as they fight amongst themselves, the Holy Mothman will look down upon them, and whisper in its unearthly thoughts ‚ÄúNo...‚Äù and cleanse the lands.... with his Anti Armor Hunting and Handmade Rifles. 
---
Equals Close Parentheses 
---
It would be nice if the legendary mole miner can scrap our Legendaries and mix match them. Say if I have a one star bloodied 10mm pistol, and a three-star stalker‚Äôs 10mm with faster reload and reduced weight, it would be wonderful if the mole miner can scrap the two and make a bloodied version with faster reload and reduced weight. That would make all Legendaries very collectible not just a few explosive ones. 
---
Explosives/heavy weapons /sneak build here (yea, kind of a paradox build but if I can get sneak hits with explosives, ooh boy...).
---
Perks: Grenadier Rank 1, Demo Expert Rank 4, Bear Arms Rank 3,  Ordnance Express Rank 3
---
My current Heavy Weapon/explosives  load out consists of:
---
\~ TwoShot Fatman: 3-4 shots will kill a level 80 Scorchbeast on the ground. I've 1 Shot a level 91 Glowing Deathclaw   with it  also great on groups of enemies that are fairly far away. It being 2 shot, it covers a bit of a larger area. I've yet to test it wit ha MIRV (I have 4 MIRV mods in my stash, so I might have to give it a shot) (If I can get sneak attacks (3.50x at night 2.50x during day, it's stupid silly damage.)
---
\~Furious Gatling Laser (with +50% limb Damage) : Not sure, haven't really used it much aside from SQB fights but it'll rip through a bunch of stuff..
---
Mutants Auto Grenade Launcher (With 25% faster Firerate): Fun as hell toy, good for closer  groups of enemies that the fatman would be too dangerous to use.like Mr. Gutsies or Super Mutants.
---
and Varying Grenades...I mainly stick with the Nuka-Grenade (not the quantum variant) and the MIRV. Both seem to offer the most...bang for the buck. Nuka grenade is like a mini mini nuke going off.
---
Fun to use? Hell fuckin' yea there's EXPLOSSSIOOOONS! and sending muties into space! Effective? Depends on the situation!
---
\~Official partner off Mister Torgue Industries
---
\*\*Not recommended for indoor use. Doing so may result in loss of life or limb.
---
Why are you even on here then? 
---
Has some to do with levels. I've never seen a group that was majorly below 100 take her out even when they all had duped OP weapons. Takes levels to get lucky and find the right gear and build yourself to use it right.
---
My cameleon doesn't work anymore. Xb1
---
I've seen her go down in less than a minute multiple times
---
He looks creepy - what's his back story? 
---
Well if you don‚Äôt like it then why even follow the subreddit? 
---
Fair enough. Thanks for the help. 
---
You could also not logout in a popular nuke zone.
---
No real life.... and if your struggling with addiction why would you try to get your friends to try the thing your addicted too...
---
Come from a family full of alcoholics  and drug addicts.... doing drugs and drinking is always a choice...
---
Just like it‚Äôs a choice if you been griefed to do the same thing to some one else
---
Misery love company...
---
It‚Äôs not always like that, I‚Äôve been there many times, sometimes there‚Äôs only one legendary sometimes a couple. It‚Äôs all in the hands of RNG god. 
---
The worst part of a nuke run is gonna be the Assaultrons that seem to appear at the worst possible moment when you're getting a prostate exam from a series of laser turrets. The rest of the robots are cake imho.
---
I mean really am I missing something. Do I need to start following the subreddit of games I don‚Äôt enjoy to troll and try to suck the enjoyment out of anyone who wishes to discuss their delight about it?
---
I stopped playing for a long time now. Is it worth it to comeback yet?
---
I'd use the mod for it but I don't really wanna risk getting banned over using mods, until they're officially supported in some way in the game.
---
I'd be all for some local text chat...
---
Cause I can do what I want lol why are you defending the game like you work for Bethesda?
---
I've definitely seen events spawn in nuke zones before, and the mob spawns *do* seem affected. This is a fascinating idea!
---
Damn that's really cool. Might make that my new desktop background lol
---
The Chosen Bone
---
Agreed the sad thing is if you changed one thing by modding it they dont stack anymore...... so two duped tse handmade with different, barrels no longer stack....
---
Hope the Bos plan drops are fixed
---
Would be nice if they added more. Or added a lock item to character feature. If they can tag an item for being crafted from atomic shop and prevent drops/scraps, they should be able to implement locking favorites items. Maybe I‚Äôm asking for too much ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Let‚Äôs try. What system you on 
---
You say you have a ton of mutations.... how do you not lose them when you get rid of rads?
---
Don't forget that form 73-C A.1 requires notarization.  
---
Did you play it at launch or BETA?
---
Bodkin point arrowheads!

The comment should probably be deleted. It just a pointless accusation that proves nothing and reflects poorly on yourself.

I wont post the worst pvp bug here for fear of drawing more attention to it. There needs to be an option in game for just reporting bugs. I could care less about reporting players I just want to report the exploits they need to fix.
---
Serums and even recipes are sold by vendors, and enough people learned them legitimately before the price hikes that you can‚Äôt reasonably argue that they‚Äôre basically ALL duped.
---
Once learned, serums are relatively cheap to make; a lot of people will make em for free for friends (Stranger in Numbers boost), especially if they provide the flux.
---
You mean keep their games alive like usual?
---
My excavator pa was good for 400 now I only have 200+ something. 
---
Local text chat would be great for this game.  Remotes are clumsy and waste time trying to select something close to what you want to express.    I don't want  to use my Mic either.
---
What's it look like
---
What time you‚Äôre usually online? Tried to catch you but you were offline those times.
---
I got this Bloodied Pitchfork today. I can finally riot. I've also got a flaming spiked mod for it. Though, I'd much rather an anti-armour pitchfork...
---
[https://imgur.com/gPipGqL](https://imgur.com/gPipGqL) 
---
I use level 0 locks. Lets people know I don't want to share, but not enough to stop them if they want it.
---
Just have to scrap more weapons. Only a few that dont have silencer mods you can learn.
---
Any build's fine as long as the scorchbeasts will land. In some parts of the map they struggle to find a landing spot. VATS crit rifle builds are probably best at killing them in mid-air. 
---
Oh yeah, my apologies.
---
I think the trouble is that a lot of other players are also server hopping, and draining the events. Back before the Patrol Duty rewards were commonly known, it was a lot easier to find.
---
friendly fire only works with fire. not plasma
---
Are Tesla coils always damaging everybody surrounding or hostile/attacking? Cause if first it‚Äôs a great risk in Whitespring.
---
Just a semi - minor - counter argument to a lot of what I keep seeing. I think it's good to value what people who've spent tons of time in game have to say because at least they're informed (you hope) on what their complaints are. 
---
As opposed to many of those reviews/complaints that were from people who played a few hours and gave into the... Anti-hype?
---
I think this game has really high potential. And it's moving towards it slowly. But Bethesda shouldn't get a free pass for some of the stuff it's tried to pull with this game. We should hold them to a hire standard next time.
---
I am on PS4 and cordially invite you to slay me with kitchen utensils.  Proof of concept, yanno.
---
Keep on scrappin' my friend. Most ballistic rifles and pistols (and even shotguns) will have suppressors if you eventually scrap enough of the kind of thing you want to be suppressed. Also keep in mind you may need to have certain perks (gunsmith) to add a suppressor even if you know the plan.
---
Not really, my team was attacked, tracked down, and killed for our stable flux as soon as we killed the scorch queen.  I guess he (the other guy in full sentinel armor) attacked one of us, and that person probably returned fire and dragged us all into pvp.  It was a setup to take the flux and yeah that sucked plus I lost all my other junk after a day of looting, not to mention the hardened mass needed to make flux......
---
I was still in pacifist mode when I got killed.
---
If you're on PS4, I'll gladly wait at the targeting computer for you to trigger One Violent Night. I'm level 187, heavy weapons, have 15 keycards ready, and I have a 3* level 50 Ghoulslayer's Super Sledge with swing speed.

---
Half the caps still disappear into the void,  even if a teammate takes your bounty. 
---
I am interested in this as well. In fact, I dropped mine purposely, when I was running out of space. Now that the stash has been expanded, and I'm further along in the game with a better handling of exactly what I'd like to keep, I have room and would like to possess this weapon again. Not so much because I have a use for it, but because it's unique and I like to save that kind of stuff (contrary to my earlier action lol).
---
I'm wondering if you can just create another character, acquire it with them, and then do some trading back and forth with another player to transfer it to your desired character. Aside from just running the quest again with my main (if that were even possible), or somehow requesting another after having done the quest already (also not possible, as far as I know), this seems like it'd be the way to go about reacquiring one. 
---
Sorry it‚Äôs nerve racking dealing with the people who say such rude stuff. I was trying to praise the game but I guess that to much for some people to take without throwing out insults.
---
Unable to get on, but highly interested in any Mutant's armor you have.
---
That'll go well with the camo paints I'll be buying as soon as I rack up the last 230 atoms I need to get that bundle! 
---
 who doesn't love a good bone?
---
That's fair. There was a decent amount of hate for other reasons but it was pretty justified to hate on the game for being buggy. Just because it's better now that doesn't mean that all never happened, and it's important to remember that as a part of the game's evolution.
---
It wasn't for me, initially, either, when I saw this, but I came back and checked again an hour later and it was. Just keep at it and you're bound to see it for free. 
---
Have a look on YouTube. I feel Rifle Gaming May have done this already in one of his clips. 
---
This is a great idea.
---
This actually a must have. Those emote things are not clear and I think that mistakes happens.
---
I didn't encounter anyone that actually uses its mic and thats since the game launched.
---
I am located in central EU, so I guess when i connect to server it sents me to other EU people, but I noticed from videos on youtube, that there is a lot of chatter going on on the US servers.
---
This is the right way of helping new players out! I have like 600 boiled water (don't ask, I was VERY bored) and just drop bags of it randomly in front of Vault 76. I think it's a nice little surprise, even for people who aren't new to the game and just made a new character.
---
pretty sure todd said the game sold well
---
They're still a thing. You'll eventually unlock it, just need to keep on scrapping away.
---
yes sloth or mirelurk king would be the next strongest of the tamable ones the yao guai you can tame is only lvl 16 i think where the mirelurk is lvl 30
---
It is the worst mod, and looks the worst with the flamer mod, which you definitely want.
---
Dang it I bought this at full price yesterday haha üíî
---
Judging from the way people were talking about nukes at the Fasnacht event, they can affect event spawns for better or worse. So, hey, it's worth a shot.
---
I honestly think it was an oversight. I know it doesn't rank in the pantheon of bug fixes, but I still want this given attention over just about anything else in the game.
---
I misread that and really got my hopes up that WoW was adding a Necromancer class. Still cool for ESO, but I would have been 100x more hype if it was WoW instead.
---
The whole premise of this game is rebuilding as a group. That is why it is multiplayer. Why would they make a perk card that basically turns the game into single player? I wish the game would focus more on playing as a team and not solo. 
---
I think the game now deserves praise, but I mostly agree with the one you had a back and forth with. The game‚Äôs start was very VERY rough.
---
i‚Äôve seen that happen as well, and i‚Äôve noticed that when they drop more than one at least one of them is usually a really good drop. i once got two legendaries from one 3* and got a vampire‚Äôs explosive double barrel which was probably the best drop i had gotten at the time. one of my friends also once claimed to have gotten five drops from one ghoul at whitespring so i guess it sometimes gets pretty insane
---
I love it! Good job &lt;3 
---
Haha for real! Also the Chainsaw has the most sickening mods in the game, on top of just being damn satisfying to use! 
---
Haha making the Chainsaw viable is a long, dark road.
---
The reason the game failed so much is because it got over hyped, now that bethesda released new features people are coming back and expecting the worst out of a game that isnt too horrible which makes it seem actually pretty good 
---
And I said it was but now it‚Äôs better. Still there no reason for that guy to question if the post is written by a five year old. I shouldn‚Äôt have even responded because he obviously doesn‚Äôt have very good people skills. 
---
Welp I just so happened to snag a level 30 mirelurk king as soon as I posted this xD
---
I heard bad things about the sloth (noise wise) so I'm not even mad. Thanks for the info
---
So I am wasting my time trying to talk to someone like that.
---
So realistic!
---
Its literally going to happen.

doesn't work for power armor btw ,youl lwant to use power patcher for power armor

Saying Fallout 76 is one your "favorite games ever" is saying a lot about the kinds of games you like and your standards.
---
Out of curiosity what other post-apocalyptic, multiplayer, open-world games have you played? 
---
   
---
Looks like they‚Äôre about steal your Platinum Chip
---
yea the mirelurk king barely makes any noise unless hes attacking something
---
If you‚Äôre going to reply please do so with only one message. This isn‚Äôt texting.
---
Condition of the item affe ts DR.
---
Give it time, or post a legit criticism, Or mention anything about the suspensions.
---
Yup, sneak is broken,vats is broken and switching from one weapon to another from your favorites takes forever. I ended up punching my new alienware m17, i know its not my system as it is built up there and i have the fastest connection Xfinity can provide. Bethesda needs to fix their shit. If modders from the nexus can fix bugs,make patches, add endless content for the fallout franchise for free then i dont see why a company that profits from these games cant. 
---
Hey, what's the paint on the t-51 and x-01 in the screenshot?
---
&gt; what a grand and intoxicating innocence
---
There is no other game like fallout 76. There‚Äôs online survival games and their are MMOs but there are no games that have a dynamic world like fallout that are online that I‚Äôve ever played. 
---
The second rank of the Starched Genes perk prevents you from getting rid of mutations when healing rads or obtaining new ones.
---
It just boggles my mind to wonder what's going on under the hood of this game to cause such a thing.
---
I still have some masks left if you want one of each. Xbox
---
Good to know, I'll have to look into that perk then!
---
A text chat for PS4 would be great as well.  
---
Just add a text chat regardless of console.  
---
It is, that's how it works. Failsafe. 
---
Oh lol well I feel stupid now. Thanks!
---
So you decided to post a hate post on a sub that doesn't hate what you're posting about. Also how troll do you need to be for salt to be for thee but not for me? Guano ganache?
---
76 newbie question: What's that thing to the right of your water purifier?
---
Then your friend should be on passive too. And you should save your loot in stash more often. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt know you were the Reddit police. I like the game and I think the criticisms was hysterical. It had bugs when it launched but they have been working on that so I am giving credit where I think credit is deserved. I am also going to give Bethesda credit for making some of the best games of all times and I think fallout 76 continues that trend.

Found one in the shack by the antique shop 
---
You only have to put in passive. And they can't hurt you  or your stuff. Make sure your teammates are passive too. 
---
This is... peculiar.
---
What this person was doing was quickly finish off the mobs you tagged. Is not uncommon to do this and you should have been getting exp and loot for the kills.
---
I actually had this done 'impromptu' in the Whitesprings resort while sneaking around doing the sword retrieving part of the Mistress of Misteries quest.
---
Pretty sure he/she did not realise that it was an alt and this wasn't my first rodeo - so to speak - but I thought it a fairly kind thing to do for a stranger that could potentially mess with the lvl of the respawns he/she was farming for exp so I just went along with it.
---
Yeah, Started Genes 2 is very useful. I have it for my level 45 stealth sniper, chameleon speed demon and marsupial.
---
Yeah... Smooth
---
Everything is perfect about this , the lighting, angle, etc. 
---
You can leap over buildings, you can run around without power armor and be invincible, you can shoot exploding bullets, you can launch nukes... Game isn't restrictive your just  too into meta. Plenty of freedom.
---
I personally have enjoyed it since day one despite the bugs. They were definitely frustrating though.
---
Honestly this is sad. We have an alcohol perk now that doesn't work with half of the alcohol in game. Granted Nukashine would be op but then again you get teleported to the ass end of the wolrd after 2 mins so it's value would still be questionable. In any case nobody stops them from rebalancing with perk card in mind. Or just make it so Party Boy/Girl extends duration instead of stat boost.
---
Go to bed 
---
Dude it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve played WOW. I wouldn‚Äôt have surprised me if it did. I hope the necromancer is good in ESO though. That was the one thing I didn‚Äôt like about summerset is it didn‚Äôt have a new class.
---
Cmon man... That's always a thing in survival. Windows get you killed, build them higher and don't put tables near them.
---
I got the loot but no exp, which was what I was after in the first place. :^(
---
The person also gave me a ton of water and a few chems so I know they were just trying to help, but in the end it didn't help at all, which is why I wanted to ask people to maybe ask first or something like that!
---
Or, just maybe, you're delusional.
---
Your just doing it wrong.
---
Backpacks sound nice, for the utility and Fashion 76 meta
---
You seem stuck on a lot of points that just simply aren't true. Now 76 may not be something you like, cool, doesn't have to be, but I think the real problem is that it's just different than what you're used to. 
---
Saying that a live player doesn't at least fulfill the same role as an NPC or companion is just weird. The companionship system is so much better with so much more potential because rather than scripted dialogue options or preset actions, you can do nearly anything, at any time. 
---
You talk about branching quest paths, but you have endless options in 76, not just limited to a few prescripted options that mostly still end in the exact same way with minor sometimes meaningless changes. So saying 76 is somehow less of an RPG because you have a more open world, less forced questlines and true playerpath control is just absurd. If anything, I'd say 76 is the MOST rpg and perhaps the least scripted adventure.  In what other game can you solely exist as your own wasteland merchant or hell a farmer or join any other faction you want and form your own parties. Maybe this just comes with having a lot more experience with tabletop RPGs instead of just games, because I'm used to using my own imagination and creativity to be a part of creating the story instead of just being told one. 
---
Also without mods, the building system in 76 is far superior to 4. Outside of having mindless settlers that more often got into problems rather than solved them, I'd much rather just play with another actual human being. Even the most useless troll on the server is likely more beneficial than any settlers ever were. 
---
To be fair if someone really wanted to come in your house and kill you they could just blow the walls open
---
This is a regular question? Besides I already slept.
---
Not sure if your stroking your ego or just being a jerkoff..... Shitpost;
---
It looks like you‚Äôre about to be killed or giving them the chance to surrender.
---
Is it a lootable corpse or a dressed up ghoul? I‚Äôve been keeping my eye out but if it‚Äôs a body laying on the ground I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll be hard to see if it‚Äôs laying in grass or bushes
---
I can't seem to get the take photos in the forest area one to trigger. I've been all over the forest maxing my camera each time to no avail.
---
Ghould exploading in confetti would be nice.
---
Also, if you don‚Äôt have anything to contribute or something else to do and just make silly remarks, then you‚Äôre feeling lightheaded and you‚Äôre not yourself, so you should go rest your head for a while.
---
people can also get in through the metal doors with ‚Äúwindows‚Äù, tested it myself yesterday and got pretty annoyed because i really like how they look but had to think about the workbench placement all over again
---
Thank you! ^^
---
Fireproof makes TSE a non issue. Dewatering their ability to use a gun after the first shot helps. Don't know why you need more than that.
---
Not playing anymore but this is the way I've done it in the past. Created new character and rushed straight for the quest. Traded to a friend and gave it back on my desired character. Took me about a hour if I remember correctly
---
Can't argue with the 'ask first' part. Communication is key. The other person probably did not realise that you were not getting exp because this, at least in my experience (no pun intended), is unusual.
---
Unless you have a biological or technological barrier to surmount in order to use a mike. If that is the case you better be very good at communicating with emotes ;)
---
Because you know, text chat is so 90's, let's do away with it, no one will miss it :P
---
Will do, thanks for the advice 
---
It‚Äôs a great spot!
---
It's random.  Get rid of mutations until the one you want gone is gone, then get the ones you want back.  There is no way to pick which one is removed first.  
---
You can save time by crafting the serums you want for your build beforehand. 
---
Grounded is a good mutation to have for the most part, I'd keep it unless you're hellbent on using energy weapons in PVE.
---
&gt;only lvl 40
---
Here's me, trying my best at lvl 38... Had the game since about a week after it released 
---
Please tell your wife to come and join us on Instagram! There is a whole community of us on there who play fallout for the pictures and it‚Äôs such a lovely group of like minded people. I‚Äôm wasteland_snaps and everyone I follow is an awesome wasteland photographer üëç
---
I kill them in one shot.
---
From where you're kneeling must seem like an 18 karat run of bad luck.
---
Maybe you are. The post has a number of people who liked it so it makes me feel as though I‚Äôm not the only one. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs to much for some people to handle that there are people who enjoy this game but that‚Äôs life right? You‚Äôre not going to agree with everyone.
---
Stop being a hoarder stash is fine. Remember when we had 400? I'll take 800 and stability thanks.
---
Thank you! I love stumbling upon other players‚Äô CAMPs, but very rarely do. The last few I came across I couldn‚Äôt access though as I would have to break in, and not so fond of being wanted :P
---
what I don't understand is how some people still clam his game looks worse than NV and 3? yet these same people make videos/like fallout 4
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs back of a Windmill Generator.
---
If you scroll down [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Generator_(Fallout_76)), you can see the front view! 
---
I love how they look but they make a horrible noise!!
---
This photo is magnificent! The lighting is so good. Come and join the fallout community on Instagram if you love taking game shots. There is a big movement on their of lots of talented players sharing amazing captures from Fallout 76 and the older ones. My ig is wasteland_snaps and I follow so many incredibly talented and lovely people. 
---
Yeah, and all of this because i tried to use tnoses hard to stack metal staircases.
---
When i moved in the toxic river, i tried again and again to build a four stories staircase from the water. Using some tip from youtube, was able to stack them no problem. Then when trying to put wall around them and build on the two last floors, problems began. So i the end i gave up.
---
More recently on a new character. I build a four stories house not far from McClintock, next to some kind of cliff. I will have to rebuild it from scratch one day because thoses stairs made some problem again.
---
I think it has to do with the fact that you can only find legendary axes. It's not craftable and maybe that means it repairs differently?
---
Also, I want mods!
---
Yeah, agree. Free Enterprise salty kid.
---
I double checked and my camp is actually a bit north of yours, in a spot with a copper deposit. This area and its abundance of ponds is popular, I constantly have neighbors! I may have to move though, I keep joining servers with my camp spot being occupied.
---
I had a rad storm it lasted 1 muinet
---
duplicates, Fo76 has been plagued by them until recently
---
so, many have been taking their ultra-rare totally not OP legendary equipment, duping them, trading them for in-game stuff or selling them for cash. This lasted way longer than it should have, and imo all dupes should have been wiped.
---
What's wrong with that, outbid or move faster. Your acting like it's kindergarten and were sharing juice. Gun smuggling is cut throat.
---
Sad isn‚Äôt it 
---
 Truth is...*the game was rigged from the start*.
---
Das bad tho.
---
U.S.S.R bad friendo.
---
now that i see the edit and i know you didnt lose anything, i dont feel guilty to laugh c: i bet you felt super lucky when you saw them in your inventory
---
Some mutations are not that good even with Class Freak. I got rid of Herd Mentality on my 4th try with Radaway(?). But lost 3 good ones before that. So I stopped there and bought the serums for ones I wanted to complete.
---
Server hopping is fair enough but you'll probably pick up a couple that you don't want.
---
I have about 15 - I think there are about 3 that I definitely didn't want.
---
RIP my fire breathers helmet.
---
You're a moron for not buying a lvl 5 explosive shotgun for a measly 2k. 
---
It cuts my Gauss rifle damage 50% -- not an option I'm afraid
---
I have no idea. I think 76 looks pretty much just like 4 except it has better weather effects. In beta It didn‚Äôt look near as good as it does now so maybe a lot of them haven‚Äôt played since then.
---
Please, point out one thing I've said that is, in any real sense, "not true". There are things you disagree with, which is fine, but nothing you're pointing out as "not true" is not true. 
---
In past fallouts, companions were different people, or pets, or robots, that did specific things for you, were always available, and met specific criteria. Humans are more than that, but they don't fill that same roll in the same way. I can play this game with my friends, or random strangers, but it's inherently a different thing. I'm not saying it's better or worse, but it's  different in a very critical way. I think the lack of having the CHOICE to play this game with a non-human NPC companion is a sad lack. I'd love to have Ed-E along for the ride, or Dogmeat. Hell, a little junkbot. I get no human companions, but not even being able to say, rescue a super mutant hound? It's sad, it's something I enjoyed in past fallouts that isn't in this game. 
---
I can have a NPC if I want to start playing at 2 AM in fallout 4. If I log in at a random time in 76, no one I know will be on. Not. The. Same. Thing. Again, humans aren't "bad" but they are "different". 
---
A open world sandbox with very few quests and no quest paths is not _the same experience_ as a RPG with quest paths. It's _different_. To my mind, I want RPGS to have  CHOICES. This game, as yet, does not. It is _fundamentally_ different than even the stripped won RPG elements of past bethesda fallout games. 
---
In 4, you have more area, with FAR more things you can build with, both in terms of building materials and placed objects. You can decorate with found clutter. You aren't limited as to where you put fucking _floors_, like you are in this game. Want to put a wall down? Go ahead. In this game, the rules for building structures are MUCH more confined, with a pretty much non-existent decorating pallet. And the budget is a _joke_ compared to even the smallest fallout 4 settlement budget. 
---
But there are reasons for that, they have to balance performance for 24 people on a server, and if every person has a maxed out camp, I can see it causing issues. The fact that I don't enjoy this system as much doesn't mean I'm not glad to have it at all. 
---
Saying something is "different" isn't the same as saying something is "too bad to play". I enjoy fallout 76, but I'm also not blind to it's failings.  What the fuck is with you people and your "If you don't love everything about it, if you don't fucking worship it without question, you're not a true fan" bullshit? 
---
I still rock the bunker buster, pretty much only gets used when my buddies drag me into survival though. 
---
I tried to have an amazing time with a few friend by hunting a bounty for 500 caps. Turns out the guy was bugging and invincible.
---
You have to pay a full price because that game world is huge and well though as every other TES or Fallout game. But yeah demand quater price for bugs that were patched in few months. 
---
i bet he was in the planes dropping it and had a bit of trouble getting it out

There's a bucketload of bugs etc and no content at all. I have my doubts about the upcoming content as well, seeing that the brewer stuff wasn't all that exciting.

Yuh

Fallout 76 is a sports team that had a very rough start of the season, but are starting to bounce back.
---
There are zero NPC's you can interact with in any meaningful way, beyond receiving quests you can't say no to. 
---
Yup, they should.
---
Love the one of the space ship

I thought this was an April fools joke
---
You do.
---
Lol
---
They can't get in my home.
---
The game was a hot fucking mess when it released.  The youtubers realized real quick that hate got them views and everybody cashed in on that big time.  The whole mess with the bag (which honestly I didnt really give two shits about), the unbalanced weapons, the fucking Scorch beasts bullshit, quests that could not be finished, Scorched Beast Queen was endgame and that was it, Nuking other parts of the map didnt add up to a whole lot, killing legendary creatures didnt amount to shit, the incredibly low weight limit when the game came out, weird ass PVP system, damn perk system making me change my perks everytime I wanted to pick a lock, hack a terminal and craft gear/weapons was annoying as hell and unnecessary, the duping of items shenanigans, the list goes on.  It should have never been released when it was.  
---
I enjoyed the game myself and still do, but i totally understand why it got so much shit.  I could see the potential though and I have some faith in Bethesda getting their shit together. I agree with some of the people that i think they are going to give us some npc's.  I hope they do.    
---
You cannot.

Immortals came from the dawn of time, moving silently through the centuries.

Today comming from Welsh station going north, i stumbled on a camp where almost everything was setup outside for easy use by any visitor. But what got me was the orange cat wandering about. I almost use the xbox live messenging system to send the owner "whoa! I'm so jealous of your cat". 
---
If visitor book get added, i'll surely leave comments on them. But sometimes all i would say to people is "why do you leave the camp device outside" wich isn't the best possible comment.
---
you would think so due to fact there is already a dog helmet item in the game.
---
pc?
---
now i be hoardin'....
---
Stop looking for the invisibility glitch. It's  beyond game breaking. It's just cheating.
---
How can you say that you want more choices and a more defined story in the same sentence? I don't think you really understand how much of what you're saying conflicts. As for build, I'd say that it's probably been a long time since you've played in settlement building without mods, which is fair, who would when there's so many other options, but you definitely have more options for base items in 76 than vanilla 4. 
---
And I'm also not blind to the issues 76 still has and the ones it had at release, but I also am just incredibly tired of people using bullshit to dismiss the game which just makes it clear that they either haven't actually played it or they don't "get it" and are still playing it wrong. If you're trying to play this the same way you'd play a prescripted rpg adventure game, of course you're going to be disappointed. That isn't what this is. 
---
Let's put it in simple terms, fallout 4 was a prescripted, easy connect the dots type dnd campaign you can use, 76 is just tossing you the rule book and has an always available assortment of questions starters but it's more about the story that you want to tell and create. 
---
I'm not saying either is better or worse, I'm also agreeing that they're entirely different games and I genuinely think that's the biggest issue. Coming into this game it looks so much like 4 and kinda plays a lot like 4 from a basic functionality standpoint but that's where all similarities end.  It's a completely different thing... But that thing is DEFINITELY an RPG and if anything far more RPG than anything released prior.

Didn‚Äôt scrap my excavator I dropped it to get into it, but before I could the server crashed and into oblivion it went. RIP excavator No.1.

The game has all the code for it they just need to enable it server side for it to actually be able to do anything

Give me a dog Todd. I will work the shaft.

Done, shoot me a message tomorrow here when you‚Äôre popping online.

Link to some of her ace shots, if you please.
---
Todd "It just works" Howard, Mr. "Fallout 76 will have 16x the detail!"? That Todd Howard? After all the bullshit he's spewed over the years you'd really accept his word? 
---
He's pretty far down the list of people I'd trust at face value. Very far.
---
Have you tried logging out and back in?
---
I've had "Ghost Furniture" before, if that's what you mean?
---
Unless it's physically there (can't move through it), then I don't know.

Neither of us know how to get the xbone shots out. Link to guides that help with this please

At first I was like "They're giving away CAPS in the store!"

Then I found out you meant hats...
---
I think it helps to reboot your game. Dont think atomic shop updates while playing?
---
You got it after the shitstorm of failure that was launch. What you bought and played was miles different from what so many suffered through at launch. 
---
This game was the drizzly shits at launch.
---
Sorry should have explained better, the hives are gone now, but if you check out the til counter at the back of the house there should be 4 honey there. 
---
If they're not there someone must have gotten there first, just jump servers.
---
The game has a huge map and a bunch of quest. There‚Äôs more enemies in this one than any Bethesda game I can remember. I believe 50 different kinds. I‚Äôll admit that it needs more quest and more things to do but I don‚Äôt see why I should doubt that they aren‚Äôt going to do what they said they were going to do. The road maps seems good to me and I was only more encouraged listening to them discuss the changes coming on Friday. They have an entire studio in Austin Texas working on nothing but fallout 76 so it‚Äôs hard to imagine that some seriously content isn‚Äôt the way and they‚Äôve said it is. 
---
I already know about the list, just curious about some combinations for weapon types.
---
Because it's a video game? I don't enjoy playing with others and it's a bit sad everything is team based. Solo players have fewer perks, lesser xp boost, harder enemies etc
---
Ranged version of the Board?
---
Wood, Leather and Cloth to craft?

Pretty much all crafting is from Intelligence skill. Melee, pipe, gun, and science 2 armour's (power and non-power).

Do t even waste your time bro, none of the scout armour has legendary effects.

As you level progesss your gonna need 2-3* pieces 
---
I‚Äôm new to the game ( talking about owning it for less than a week and clocking in ~13 hours).
---
A run down is:
---
* Reading shit off paper and terminals is boring, NPCs would make the game much easier for everyone. This is worse than ghost in the original destiny. - No real solution AFAIK.
---
* It‚Äôs lonely out in the game, 24 players per server is too low (not that we‚Äôre even getting that) - solution a lobby/hub area.
---
* I *HATE* being nickel and dimed to fast travel. And it puts me off doing public events unless there is someone already doing it. - Reduced travel cost to public events?
---
Destiny style raids and strikes would help with this as it brings people together and the instancing get really offsets server load issues.
---
I'm using it as an alternative armor set I already have a fully modded out marine armor suit with the fully modded wetsuit as well I want the Scout armor for a better shock resistant suit
---
You'll need 11 points of INT minimum (Gunsmith 5 + Science/Master/Expert 2). 25 INT is recommended for the best results from crafting (crafts at max durability with 200% repair).
---
Vault 51 is a currently entirely unknown vault. We won't be getting into on it any time soon since they still have the other 3 to deal with

Scrap the wood foundation underneath it. It will transfer the rug into your stored items tab.

I thought this was a post about players damaging people on their own team by firing at them.. but then i read more and its bout that card I have never seen anyone use.     
---
Perhaps one day when ur team mate jumps in front of you and your target as your firing, they might receive some damage but until then enjoy magic protection fields that save people from dying from stupidity.  Flame on!
---
Already in if i remember?  Their is A Acoustic Signal Thingie that makes a loud sound if activated. Just put a switch on it and you have a ''Doorbell''
---
Bloodied.  TS only does +25% damage with some wild accuracy penalties.   
---
Source?
---
Wait the second projectile only does 25% damage? That's messed up. 
---
Two Shot Explosive is still the best. Full Life, one shots, no problems. Ez pz
---
The game first rolls whether you get an armor or weapon (armor has a slightly higher percentage) then for weapons it rolls if its melee or ranged (drills if they had a legendary slot could actually retain legendary effects but they don't yet they are still on the melee list. Same thing goes for syringers) then it rolls which item, then how many stars, then for each effect starting at the first it rolls for type. Since the amount of actual things it can roll for are rather small in each category you end up seeing patterns that don't actually exist.
---
On another note but regarding legendaries. Regular enemies can become legendary and if you kill it too quickly it can lose its loot due to latency.
---
Also also. Non nuke zone non event enemies have a 1% chance of being legendary if they are level 1 - 10, 2% if 11 - 20, 3% if 21 - 30, 4% if 31 - 40 and 5% if 41+. Nuke zone enemies have double the chance based on level. 
---
See and other guy says the second shot is only 25% damage. My bloodied gets as much as +75% with low health. 
---
Have you read the road map? They have raids and dungeons coming so it‚Äôs definitely in the works. Theirs also rumored to be more fallout 4 like quest with dialogue choices and consequences coming with the wasterlanders DLC. They are all free. 
---
It used to shoot another bullet but they nerfed it to 25%
---
Truth is? The game was rigged from the start.

*smacks hands to cheeks with a loud inhaling surprise sound* Holy crap! So glad to know that only the frame gets scrapped. Glad you didn't lose everything. I've come close many times and worried about scrapping in survival for this same reason.

Yea I think human NPCs are coming as well. It‚Äôs definitely not perfect but I suspect the game will only get better. Personally I‚Äôm happy that the foundation for a good game is there but they just need to add more content. The road map looks pretty cool though so I am very hopeful. The socializing at the parade was pretty awesome so they also need to add more reason for people to come together like that. I wasn‚Äôt trying to say it didn‚Äôt deserve criticism but that I don‚Äôt agree with all of it and that some people just wanted the game to die. 
---
There are actually a ton of player spawn markers around fast travel areas it's just the game only uses 1 unless it can't for some reason then it defaults to another close one.

50 different kinds? There's like 10?  The different names and models doesn't count.
---
What's your left leg doing?
---
I usually don't intervene with the smaller fry when following low levels. I attack only if I get attack, but otherwise let them handle it. I'll only flatten big robots or stuff if the low level starts struggling with them.
---
I use forest scout. Lead lined and polymer is best. But I do have one that's deep pocketed instead just for a lil extra carry weight
---
That's exactly how it should be done in my opinion!
---
Full assassin set will give 40% reduced damage from player.  
---
With sentinel's adds another 75%  
---
&amp; lone wanderer +20% more  
---
throw in some med-x and ta-da.  
---
Cool thanks

Buy a serum from a player

250c each from me if you‚Äôre on xbox
---
So an instigating mirv with faster reload and +50% limb damage isn't worth it? Seems like a Veryyyy powerful weapon to me
---
In this game, there are no choices. There's a great big open world, and one quest path. 
---
In fallout 4, there was also a great big open world, and multiple quest paths to get you to two endings. That doesn't WORK in this game, you'd have to have one ending, because open world RPG, but they could have different paths to that same ending. This is different, in a fundamental way.  Personally, I think it would be better if they'd put some time into letting you go through other quest lines, instead of a linear hallway through the factions, you could choose different methods to get to that same individual end point. If you followed prompts from the enclave, or the brotherhood, maybe you get unique loot, vendor pricing deals, etc?  
---
You legitimately are trying to say that I'm wrong to want RPG elements out of an RPG franchise? Ok, that's fine, you're entitled to your opinion, even if, in my opinion, it's fucking insane. 
---
In vanilla 4, you had _every single object in the game_ as a decorative object. You don't _have_ that in 76. Sure, base game without DLC, you were limited in wall types, but by the time you get into the DLC, you had concrete walls, you had  barn sets, you had warehouse sets... But even if you limit yourself _purely_ to fallout 4, if you enjoy building detailed settlements that are full of life and clutter? 4 was a more enjoyable system, to my mind. There's no clutter in 76, and there's not much budget to put it down if there was. 
---
And yeah of course, mods made it even better, but in 4, you had larger building areas, with more control over what you built, where, with fewer limitations, beyond the fact that you were limited to specific settlement locations. (And this is the one point, to my mind, that 76 has over 4...I love being able to put a camp wherever I want, even if I'm frustrated by how limited I am in the builds I can make there).
---
I am sick to death of people looking at legitimate criticism based on hundreds of hours of playtime and going "you haven't played the game". I have a level 140 character. I've played the fucking game, dude. 
---
There is pretty much NO FUCKING DIFFERENCE between "open world exploration in 4" and "open world exploration in 76". 76 has a bit more map, but to say that you have MORE choice in 76 is fucking laughable. You have ONE godamn questline, and what, three? Four? side quests that are more than five minutes long? Otherwise, you can wander around big open post apocalyptic wastelands killing super-mutants and robots. In 4, you also got raiders, gunners, and the brotherhood and institute. In 76, you get scorched and mythic monsters. Same basic shit, otherwise, to my mind. Baring the fact that you can do it with friends if you want in 76. 
---
I want to point something out here. You're jumping on _me_ because I replied to a post that said _76 was like 4_ and I'm pointing out ways they are different, and you're acting like I'm _attacking_ 76, for some fucking reason. 
---
Go read my original fucking reply again, dude. 
---
Nice thanks and upvote for you
---
Then your words are unrelated to your game and your complains are idiotic. We determined that theres the universe of tactical awareness in our first interaction and you have been consequentially proving that since. You are right that discussion with you is pointless as your IRL build perfectly dodges information.
---
Happy to help, it was in the store for about 15 minutes and I didn't see a post for it
---
The reviews all 5/10 really hurt this game especially as many can‚Äôt get over the fallout name.
---
Damn I wish I could do this in a phone app.
---
10 min in intelligence. At least 3 in luck for super duper, get chemist and pharmist, also INT. Green thumb 1 and butcher's bounty 3 in perception. Scrap everything you get, weapons and armor. Rank up demolition expert 5 and all 3 science= 9, Then power patcher 3 and fix it good 3, and I think there is another power armor one but don't remember the name 3.  You can switch all theses up and craft your ass off. 
---
There‚Äôs way more than 10. They are list them all at the enclave base. In a second I‚Äôll go see the exact number. The starting areas don‚Äôt do the game justice in showing the amount of creatures in the game and some things are very rare such as the mothman or the flatwoods monster. 
---
Also ammo smith 2 in agility.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PC :-)
---
Makes sense. More grind, lovely !
---
For breaking news your not really giving much actual info there.
---
If this a joke or you actually have a article to link yoo
---
My bad, there are 37 unique ones. I'll admit its pretty good though many of them are rare.
---
I heard about that. Once you die, all your items drop and you have to start a new character, can't find the article though
---
Yup and very excited!
---
Although they sound more like strikes / WoW raids to me that‚Äôs also great!
---
Destiny style raids would also be amazing (like 6 hours for average players) with loads of unique game mechanics and no explanation. 
---
So glad I got in on this game when I did to hopefully be ready for end game when raids start!
---
That‚Äôs a nice piece.  
---
These aren't the only dog items in game. Unequipable by players. May be leftovers, may be future stuff
---
It was a post I read here on Reddit. I't made me curious. Besides if one becomes invincible what good is playing the game.
---
How true.
---
THE ELDER SCROLLS V: SKYRIM
---
I have started asking if they need help before dropping aid or extra plans. 
---
And if they mention that they are looking for xp, I'll use a lower lvl weapon so I'm not killing all the things for myself.  I'm not concerned about gathering xp for me as that will naturally happen with regular gameplay. 
---
Part of the point of helping new players is for them to gain xp. I gain smiles from hearing them enjoy the game. 
---
All these plans are still in either vendor or loot lists
---
Yes I remember the show very well.
---
*Listen maggots, today ain't a nice day to die, we'll engage as planned and everything will go smooth like butter*
---
That's the 3rd weirdest strap-on I've ever seen.
---
That means you are having fun doing other stuff than just killing things.
---
It *is* a very fun game tbh 
---
I was hungry and on survival server so I ate mine.
---
Drills and syringers would be able to have legendary effects if they had a legendary mod slot but they don't. Unlike other weapons that can't be legendary which are specifically listed in the game files. 
---
Sounds like after you cleared it, no 'new' players spawned into you game
---
Doing it in a team is fine as long as you get the killing blow and do enough damage
---
I'd like to see robots picking my crops. FO4 Automatron laid the ground work for it. It would be neat to make robots and assign them to  crops.
---
I can't wait to get a stims plan haha. And they probably do appreciate it. 
---
Yeah, I spent around 200 hours alone before finding people that had fun the way I did. Most other people would just want to kill something, I liked exploring and building and occasionally kill something. Once I found good friends who like the same, the game got much better and way more fun.
---
I mean I made one post a month ago and it got like 400 upvotes, that pretty much means that Bethesda employees (Who replied to many less upvoted posts than mine that day) are either purposefully ignoring them or completely blind. 
---
Don't now if this is still a thing haven't had a teammember since then, but with teammembers i always got double loot everywhere.
---
I think you guys might just be coming from different places in regards to "choice"; the other person sounds like they're looking for RPG choices with permanent in-game consequences, which 76 is definitely lacking.
---
you're a dumbass
---
This would save so much time of little babies running away while I scroll forever... 
---
I hope bethesda at least puts a ‚Äúplease hold‚Äù emote. 
---
Huh? I thought each area was guaranteed at least 3 spawns?
---
Paper beats rocks, but scissors beats paper! It's not fair! Ha. I like how people who "speak for the community" never are speaking for the community. I agree with you. Game should be harder, not made easier.
---
Are you on Xbox? are you trying to sell that explosive laser rifle?
---
If you're using vats, don't get two-shot hunting rifle variants; Just a friendly tip. With manual aim it's okay
---
fyi the mod is called suppressor after scrapping.
---
Nice.
---
Oh, great! I was hoping that would be the case. And thank you for your response! I know it was a long time ago that you created this post. I appreciate it!
---
The game is getting better, by the way. I'd still say give it a little while longer though, if you're interested in getting back in. It might be worth coming back with a few more updates. Take care
---
If you enjoy the game fine. Your standards are low when it comes to AAA titles.  But posts like this broadcasts a message that it is acceptable for game devs to release games in such an unfinished state like FO76. You're part of the problem when you encourage this type of practice.
---
Yeah, was also thinking they could also add some kind of emote like 'I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR FREE'. I am on Xbox and by the time I have tried to find the right emote to get their attention and drop what I want to drop in 80% of the cases they have run off.
---
He knows what you're saying, of course they will do something with vault 51 in the future but it won't be for a while. His camp is safe there for a few months because the teased underground areas coming this spring/summer are under arktos pharma and harpers ferry
---
I dont use vats. Never cared for it
---
Its honestly bethesdas way to saparate the assholes from everyone else, ever since it was launched i hardly get my workbenches taken away and i hardly find anyone who tries to fight me on sight. I even tried survival for 5 minutes and lost all my stimpaks, glowing mass, dogfood and purified water in just a few deaths and oddly enough thats all i lost, everything else like nuka quantum i still had with me god dammit
---
Easiest way is to get/use a mic.  I find a few encouraging words work wonders, as well as whistling a show tune while Jet Pak‚Äôn off a building in front of them while wearing Quantum painted X-01 PA.  Mostly works, but not always.
---
P.S.A. Don‚Äôt have Explosive landing mod attached
---
I agree.  Dont get me wrong I enjoy the game and still play. I wish they would have more stuff like the parade more often.  It was fun.  I dont think you were saying it didnt deserve any criticism just some stuff that they really dropped the ball on is all.  I defended the game on youtube and facebook.  You could tell people were shitting on the game and had never even played it.  That bothered me more then anything else    
---
My guess is it's on the shelf behind the bar. But it's not my leg is a random strangers
---
Once you're past ~lvl 30, it shouldn't be a problem.
---
Because damage. There are lots of perks like radicool and nerd rage among others that boost your damage and strength stats, which boosts damage even more. Combine it with some unyielding armor and that‚Äôs when you see people with 2k+ damage per hit. A real glass cannon tho imo but deadly in the right hands. 
---
Maybe for console. I've been at 25k caps for a while looking for a few aae or the but they won't take caps, only trades for other similarly op gear.
---
Can you still get diseases without a helmet inside the camp?
---
It's good for ALL weapons because of its bonus damage.
---
True
---
Use a mic and just ask.  Just being there will pull higher lvl enemies, which several folks I have ‚Äúassisted‚Äù were happy to have, as well as just watching and only jumpin if they are getting beat, and be ready with a Stimpak when they fall.  Have made a few long term friends this way.
---
Maxed out Pharma Farma perk under luck. Have that on, And go run and ‚Äúsearch‚Äù the aid boxes, mirrors, doctor bags, etc. all over. Collect it all and you‚Äôll never run out of chems.
---
Im below level 20 and i have never had a problem with caps, first time on fallout, think its great so far! Dont get the bad reviews
---
Just walk then. You may find something interesting on the way and it doesn't really take very long to go from one side of the map to the other
---
Today I found 5 gnomes next to a low birdge surrounding a skelton. Is there any backstory to these creeps?
---
And as you said, it's there so low levels can't travel all over the map. Its purpose early on is to encourage exploration.
---
Owned. Thanks for the research!
---
I too am saddened.
---
I had tons of problems when I was your level I kept on running out
---
It‚Äôs April fools day bruh 
---
And by ‚Äúsearch‚Äù you loot the box and then push space (or whatever button on the systems) to search it again.
---
I‚Äôm newer and had this perk, didn‚Äôt realize this for way longer than I want to admit smdh
---
Tyrolean hat was never a drop. The others were very rare drops
---
The vast majority of things the unofficial patch 'fixes' are stuff people will never even notice, have affect their game, or really matter in the slightest in anyway. For every actual important fix, there are a hundred that are just some item being moved, or a small clipping issue being fixed, or a NPC not walkin two feet away from where they should be.
---
Prior to Fallout 76, Bethesda also had a team size of barely 100 people, not even near enough work force that they could be split up into JUST bug fixing for extended periods. And because they weren't a developer that just focused on minor Quality of Life and slight overhauls between releases, but instead massive changes, overhauls and improvements, the work they do between games ensures that their bug fixing processes are mainly going towards larger bugs that pop up during the process of massive and extended overhauls. Meanwhile there are thousands of modders who can pull up to a computer and fix an issue where candles are hanging two inches above a table, or where arrows don't spawn on some table, or a small corner of a dungeon has clipping issues, because those thousands of people don't have to worry about quotas, making new features, designing levels, items, abilities, enemies or every other three hundred things a small development team has to do for a massive game... We're already seeing the work Bethesda can pump out with quick, steady and massive bug fixes when they have the actual need to, with Fallout 76, they never had the team size, nor the real need, because a minor bug in a single player game that allows instant and easy reloading of a save is a whole different thing to a multiplayer game that a once minor glitch can break a player's game forever...
---
Game development is not a easy thing, there are trade offs in how much effort is put where when you have a limited team. You can either increase your team, which can bloat a project and hurt a company in the long run if a project fails or you just naturally decline, you can focus on minor quality of life and gameplay tweaks that allow you to make games at an even steady pace, but that sacrifices new mechanics, major overhauls to gameplay, feel and scope, or you do what Bethesda did, massive overhauls, changes, tweaks and additions at the expense of sacrificing polish.
---
Not their first time \*cough cough\* :D
---
Just keep grinding. Most people roam killing shit for hours a day and maybe find 1 good item every couple weeks. Sometimes a server will feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äúon a roll‚Äù and will pour legendaries from every other kill and you‚Äôll get 20-30 in a few hours but only keep 1 or 2. More kills, more chances. Rinse n repeat. 
---
What platform?
---
Xb1
---
I ran around white spring in survival clearing mobs/players. Took 2 days of 4-5 hours and got more than 12k caps from players, so I was doing a lot of PvP.
---
You got any ass/cav armor?
---
Nope but i do have alot of caps and some wares if you to have a look
---
this reminds me of the episode of spongebob where mr krabs and spongebob thought they killed the health inspector
---
Looks nice, bummer about the disconnect :/
---
Honestly the workshops have so much potential, but it's hard to get the most out of it. One time I built all the extractors at the landfill and added cardboards and arrows pointing to them as well as workbenches and relax areas, but I don't think anyone was able to make much use of it before the server crashed. :( I wish there was a way to advertise that you've set up a workshop for communal purposes... 
---
I would say reduce the fast travel cost, and increase reward items and reward loot quality. Not guarantee legendary anything. Maybe guarantee 1 legendary boss per event with an rng of it being 1-2-3 star. All I do is grind events and nobody ever shows up to any. I‚Äôm always doing them solo. 
---
Everybody loved the parade event, but what people don‚Äôt realize is the normal events could be exactly the same if people actually showed up. 
---
He's lied about almost everything under the sun over the years. Taking ANYTHING Todd Howard says without a mound of salt seems to be a questionable decision. 
---
I enjoy Bethesda games, even within a limited scope 76, but I do not trust anything that comes out of Howard's mouth.
---
That's just the reputation he's built over the years, he's a charlatan with a tongue of silver, a modern day snake oil salesman. 
---
Why would he lie? Same reason he's weaved all of his other webs of lies, to make him and Bethesda look better. Specifically, to try and repair the image that for months has been dragged through the mud and beaten savagely. It "selling well" means it wouldn't be a failure, which helps restore some of their once strong image. 
---
We've seen lots of, albeit anecdotal, evidence of it struggling to move copies.  Howard's words seem to fly in the face of all of that, and he brings nothing to backup his word. 
---
Anecdotal evidence is hardly the most reliable way to guage anything, but has about as much credibility as Howard's unbacked word does nowadays.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm getting on to do some vendor runs what‚Äôs your GT? I‚Äôll come take a look, not really interested in caps tho tbh
---
Just saw this. I was searching for the key in the Ash Heap the other day and it's not there. I wondered if it was a bug and wasn't spawning, but then found this. So I guess they fixed the mistake.
---
Only bring 2 at a time as that gives the max rewards and chance for the paints. If you want to get duplicates do not learn them as once you do you can no longer Obtain them
---
In game consequences is just something that Bethesda never really masters in my personal opinion. I can complete a massive city water project and everyone is still dying of thirst. I can pick pretty much any faction to "win" in any of the games since Beth picked it up (including NV) and essentially get the same ending with very minor differences to the real playable world. That's why the ending was always the same basic ending with a few variable chunks to be determined but still overall cookie cutter and minimal world change feel. 
---
At least in 76 if I fix a power station at least I get more juice running to a substation. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I definitely agree that's one area 76 really falls flat, but to me I've been expecting that since Oblivion. 
---
Bro we make 1400 caps a day from selling to vendors and events reward for completing. Spending a few hundred caps a day fast traveling to do events hardly puts a dent in my ever growing caps pile.  Lame excuse to say why events are doing bad. 
---
How about the fact they are kind of boring after a while. There aren‚Äôt that many to rotate through. And when events pop up that certain people don‚Äôt like, waiting for a different one kinda sucks. These are the real problems. We need more events. And better ones. 
---
You can only do it on xbox and ps4
---
Glad I held off on buying these. I liked their look, but they don't match with anything else that's clean just yet.
---
63826691
---
Well lmk as I have to charge my phone and won‚Äôt have it on me while I‚Äôm playing. If you‚Äôre just trying to spend caps for it I understand tho and hopefully someone will sell it to you.
---
No worries :)
---
Goodluck
---
And here in is the problem with April fools on the internet the world has a 24 hour timezone so it's not actually in a lot of places
---
I just want to use my TSE Flamer.  Pls Bethesda 
---
No more bad guys to hunt for a bounty. I always enjoyed that. Now I'd have to go into a very different game mode.
---
Would rather Bethesda just added a separate pve game mode and left Adventure with the lite pvp elements.
---
But people will notice soon enough, when camps become invulnerable and they can't destroy turret bases at WS or camps on rare vendor spawns anymore, that a little pvp was a good thing.
---
alternatively, how about free travel between train stations?
---
I leave everything unlocked on purpose to share. Some people take naps and water and use some benches and move on. Some people take all my resources then blow my camp up ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Bulk steel weighs the same as the amount of steel you put in

I feel like I ruined the joke now, sorry OP. I should‚Äôve let the outrage continue 
---
I've experienced a fight against an immortal in full sentinel assassin's set. The guy tanked all my 500 * 2.5 damage bullets with his head while standing still. 
---
Im fine with either way btw what is the level and does it have a 3rd effect?
---
I just hope it makes it easier to get top legendary gear. The duping has left some people with the everything with full ass/sent gear. 
---
Getting that legit is almost impossible as that stuff was suppose to be super rare. For those who didn't dupe or buy duped, they are at a huge disadvantage.
---
I read your initial comments and everything since but you're not actually responding to my actual criticism. You're just putting other people's words in thinking my complaint is theirs. It's not. I understand what you said and I am explaining the issue I have with it pretty clearly.
---
No need to keep going back and forth though, I just fundamentally disagree and I just don't think you're understanding at all what's being said, or just missing the entire point. 
---
Choice is a different thing to different people. You're talking about a directed choice like items on a restaurant menu. I'm talking about choice like going to the grocery store and buying whatever ingredients I want. Both are choices, but two very different things. One is done for you from a small collection of options, the other is limited only by yourself and your actual literal choices. 
---
Also, just as a side point, clutter isn't in Fo4 by default, nor are most the in world game objects, those are usually added by other mods. I know because I've either worked with the person who released them or was that person myself.  Adding additional settlement areas and objects was a huge part of what I did since fo4 was released.

Just your friendly neighborhood dataminer here to remind you that pencils contain lead in this world

Max 2*

Ok just making sure it isnt like level 5
---
You know, it's legitimately funny. I do talk to people frequently who don't run into bugs in bethesda games.
---
Maybe I spend more time exploring the strange corners, and thus run into more bugs. 
---
In skyrim, off the top of my head, I've gotten stuck in a cage, i've gotten stuck in an elder scroll, I've had quest NPC's disappear, show up in the ground after dying, I've had the main quest audio not unpack properly...That's the shit that just floats to the top of my head in less than a minute without really thinking about it. 
---
Are a lot of the fixes minor? Of course! Are some of them for major bugs in both the main quest-line and the side quests? Also of course. 
---
Bethesda has released the same games, with the same known bugs, across multiple console generations. Skyrim has been on Playstation 3 and 4, Xbox 360 and one, switch, and PC multiple times. And today, in versions of the game they are charging $60 for eight years after release, are game-breaking bugs that were known about within the first  few weeks of the game being out.  I don't give a _shit_ what their staffing is like. They are making _insane_ amounts of money off these games, enough to make re-working them for publication on _new generations of consoles_ something they would _never_ do if it wasn't very profitable, and NOT fixing major bugs on the _main fucking quest line_ along the way. That is unacceptable.  The fact that, in skyrim for the switch, you can still get stuck in the fucking elder scroll, is fucking insanity. 
---
So yeah, I come into 76 watching and waiting for the usual buggy mess, and I'll be honest, the 76 team, hands down, is the _best_ bethesda has ever put on a games bugs. They actually look at major game breaking problems and try to fix them. 
---
But the company as a whole?  No. They're not doing right by their player base when it comes to bug fixes. 
---
For the Pit-boy!
---
The price should be increased.  I would much rather see the maximum raised above 25k.
---
But I want explosive melee weapons :(
---
Do mayor for a day in watoga, when you're finished you get a key to the safe, there's usually between 3 and 8 stimpaks in there. Relog and reloot. Or you can do a lap of whitespring every time you log in, I do this and always end up selling them to cut weight
---
Once you reach a certain point, you know how many of what you need on hand at any given time. You know what to loot for specific junk you typically use. You won‚Äôt be picking up random guns or armor because you‚Äôll be farming for specific stuff. Or you‚Äôll pick up everything and end up dropping all of it if none of them have the specific legendary effects you are hunting for. There are bare essentials that you actually need to stay alive, and keep all your gear repaired. Everything else is playing the rng game and hoping the next drop is what you‚Äôre after lol
---
I didn't even have 500 atoms so I clicked it right away. 
---
Tech data can literally spawn in any container in the world. 
---
This is incorrect. You have a hidden stack of tech data and turning in that stack with 2 or more gives you better rewards. 
---
Yes you can but it only displays as one in your inventory however it is actually a stack it's just that the amount is hidden 
---
Definitely this. Some exploded instantly, some drop to the ground and blow up a sec or 2 after which is usually when you‚Äôre just about to peak at what dropped then boom üí• 
---
Sry PS4
---
There are no walls, that could stop me.
---
You better go outside fight me.
---
Exactly.  I was trying to figure out a way to advertise.  Maybe the player vending will help with that?
---
This is kind of why we needed a PvP server. There's plenty wrong with survival mode, but I think if they try to turn it into adventure mode with no pacifist feature people are going to be a lot less willing to contain their PvP shenanigans to survival mode. I think that was the main selling point for this patch which didn't really introduce much for PvE players. At this point I'm not interested in grinding up *another* character to 50 to unlock all the necessary perks and I imagine others aren't much interested in it either. If you chase interest away from the PvP crowd they're going to stay in the PvE servers.
---
Yeah like I said I gotta charge my phone so lmk your GT if you wanna link up 
---
Very nice layout and decorating :D
---
Do you come across many enemies in that spot?
---
Log out and in and they respawn every time
---
People seem to have the wrong idea on how world loot works. Actual world loot that isn't accessed by a container will reset on server hopping. Container loot has a set time limit before it respawns
---
Not in survival, where you die, lose 400caps and you can't fast travel with your zero caps. You can't fastravel there because spawn campers anyway, but you get my point.
---
I was once on Seneca Rocks and looked East. I could see a firefight with plasma grenades going off through the trees of The Mire which I found impressive
---
I posted this on someone else's post a couple of months back when we still had 400-600 stash sizes, I still do everything pretty much the same way, so I'll post it here:

If  you like hoarding legendary items I highly recommend making an alt to  transfer to. I have 2 dozen friends I've never talked to (which is  common for me for some reason) just so I can reconnect to a map and  transfer stuff via a 0 capacity cabinet (my only real friend and  favorite NPC in the game). If you have future builds planned, make the  base level 2 characters and move the items over. Be prepared to lose  stuff once in a while with that method as people sometimes ~~quit the game~~  crash or disconnect in the 15-20 seconds it takes to swap characters.  This has the side affect of being able to give those alts stuff to sell once you've capped your primaries daily sales.
---
So  with pretty much no weapons or armor in my stash here's the priorities I use to reduce back to ~~400~~ 600 when I hit ~~600~~ 800. This is mostly in order,  although I never remember to do it all in this order.
---
**Crafting**
---
* Smelt all of your rotten stuff into fertilizer and dump the remainder.
---
* Convert all of your ore using acid.
---
* Cook all meat and produce so you can get rid of non-perishable foods and use up water. 
---
* Craft merged drugs (Bufftats, etc), Stimpacks, and other regular drugs.
---
* If you don't care about the things they make scrap all Beer Bottles, Molerat Teeth, Circuit Boards, Assualtron, Bleach Dogwood,  and Deathclaw Hands.
---
* Craft  bullets. You might think you have enough, but if you have guns, you don't. If you don't use lead in repairs, use all your lead this way.
---
* Repair  your own stuff. (This should be done first, probably. I usually forget until now. Good thing I don't use lead in repairs.)
---
* Bulk up Aluminum and Lead. Nothing else drops weight other than the plastic you use for the bulking.
---
* Repair all expensive armor and weapons you intend to vendor.
---
* If there is legendary armor you want to keep, check if you can put Light or Ultra-Light on it for storage.
---
**Shopping**
---
* Sell Non-Perishable food. It just ends up adding up over time, dump it and cook better food for buffs. Canned food is pointless once you learn to farm, it just takes up space and you'll end up overstocked in no-buff food.
---
* Sell Alcohol if you don't intend to use it. It tends to stack up quickly if you loot it every time you see it. Unless you're planning on using it, it should go.
---
* Bulk up and sell most junk so you only have 5-10 of each in bulk. 5 of rarely used and 10 of what you repair with. I'm a non-power armor user so I only keep Adhesive, Acid, Plastic, Wood, and Ballistic Fiber in 10's.
---
* If  you keep having non-bulking junk hit over stacks of 100, sell the individual back down to 50 (Because Vendors will buy most non-bulkable items). It's usually good for 50-70 caps per stack. I constantly sell Yarn, Crystals, Silver, and Circuits; 50 of each cleans out 1 vendor.  Keep all plastic for bulking more items for sale.
---
* **Sell chems** that don't match your build. Melee build? Sell your Calmx. Sniper build? Maybe dump some fury. Keep 5 of each for posterity?
---
* Check your Misc tab for burnt books and such. They sell for 1 cap each and have weight.
---
* If  you are not in the habit of using mines, sell them as well. They're good, but if you never use them they are just dead weight.
---
* ~~Bobby pins. You shouldn't need more than 30-40 on hand. 100 bobby pins are 10 pounds.~~ *Fixed in a patch.*
---
**Dump/Transfer/Use**
---
\*Leave things in cash registers, garbage cans, or suit cases at shop vendors to help out your fellow 76er's.
---
* If  you don't use the weapons dump, Missles, Mini Nukes, .50 Cal Balls,  Cannonballs, Harpoons, Crossbow Bolts, Flares, Railway Spikes, Plasma  Cores, 40mm Grenades, 2mm EC, Gamma Rounds, Cryolator, Flamer Fuel, and  Paddle Ball String. You can find/craft more in the future if you need it, even that smaller size ammo is 1lb per 100.
---
* Any  Fusion Cores under 50%. If you have 3 at 100% that's all you should  need. I can't even give fusion cores away to PA users I meet. I personally only keep 1.
---
* Scrap Steel that you couldn't bulk. If you hit 200 Scarp Steel you're hoarding wrong. If you need more steel and can't find it, you haven't left the vault yet and don't need to be reading this.
---
* Books and Bobble heads you'll never use. (See "Sell chems" above)
---
* Recipes you already know.
---
* Left over Rotten and Spoiled foods.
---
**Other Things**
---
* With junk in your inventory, go to the junk tab in your pip-boy and go to "Component View". Tag what you always need/want and only grab that junk when out (it will have a little magnifying glass). This will reduce the speed at which you fill your stash
---
* Consider using Nuka-Cola's as a replacement for Stimpacks. They weigh the same but build up over time. Save the Stimpacks for when you really need  them.
---
* Connected with the above, consider Traveling Pharmacy. Even 1 level will let you just stack bunches of 1lb chems in your inventory. At level 3 100 Chems  weigh 10 lbs in your inventory. It's the only weight Perk I'd recommend  for the sole purpose of medigating Stash weight *unless* you have Speed Demon and always need food, then Thru-Hiker is also a good use of an Agility point.
---
This was longer than I intended it to be. So I hope it helps some, none, or all who read it.
---
&gt;End Copy/Paste

Perfect for a survivalist character. 
---
Lets be fucking clear here. You're putting words in my mouth and getting offended that I'm not going "Oh you're right you're right" when you're just...flat out fucking wrong about everything you're saying that I'm saying?
---
We do fundamentally disagree, I'll go that far, what I don't get is why you're so fucking hung up on putting words in my mouth. 
---
You have the -exact- same level of choice, in your sense, in 4 as you do in 76, but you have _none_ of the choice, in the sense I mean, in the choices presented in a _fucking RPG_ like fallout games generally are. As I've stated before, you can go out into 4 and have the exact same open world exploration sandbox experience as you get in 76. 
---
In fallout 76, you go out, you follow the path presented to you by the overseer, or you wander off to kill bugs and mutants. 
---
In fallout 4, you wander out of the vault with the quest to go find your kid. or, you know, you wander off to kill bloodbugs, mutants, maybe take part in a heist, maybe save some runaway slaves, maybe murder some run-away slaves, whatever. 
---
But in the "you can walk around in the wasteland and choose where you stand and what you do" same shit. 
---
Clutter can be _manually fucking placed_. You don't need any of the mods that create clutter objects, you want a fat man on your desk, you can place a fatman on your desk, you want a basketball in a bucket? you can put a basketball on a bucket.  Want to put beer in a nuka cola fridge? you can do that. All vanilla, all base game. No mods needed. 
---
Ok my gt is BetaSoulTV but im about to goto bed you messaged me as i was about to fall asleep was gonna try to close the deal before sleep but let me know tomorrow if you wanna trade it i can be on at around 10:00 PST
---
Actually those were mine. That's usually where I keep my legendaries. No issue though, you can return them to me whenever's convenient
---
Then why play survival in the first place?
---
Plus there's already a system in place for this with the mystery mistress items. 
---
Welcome to r/fo76 where the downvotes are random and don't make any sense
---
Mirv is set to split at the height of the arc so unless you aim up slightly they split immediately and one lands near you. It's not a bug it's working as designed people are just kinda stupid sometimes and ignore things that get said a lot. If you need it modded and are on pc I have it learned and will do it for free 
---
Oof 
---
Hard mode outfit. If you ever see someone swinging with it you know they have no damage resist lol
---
Yeah respawn time tooks 30minutes, you can bypass that by leting someone log in near area that is cleared. If you have group, let one guy log out, and log in back to respawn those ghouls.
---
The game community isn't too bad, but the subreddit loves to downvote every dissenting opinion. Case in point
---
At the PAX panel Todd "The Rodd" Howard said what they intended with survival mode. They thought players would form groups, only carry what they need, and buy stuff to keep their caps down. However, people are playing it like adventure mode.
---
Given that they designed it with those ideas in mind, they will either have to redesign survival mode or find a way to get players to stop playing survival mode like adventure mode.
---
Makeshift warrior would be the equivalent at this stage I guess?
---
Oh boy does it chug fusion cores. Like, nir one of my 5 armors has a jet pack just for that reason :s
---
This was very helpful, thank you
---
This mechanic can be awesome or it can be life threatening. Being a lower level and having a higher fast travel near Lewisburg after taking 30 minutes to clear it and having everything spawn max level while you're in a building searching AT LEVEL 20 can really put a damper on things
---
It is not uncommon for companies to do that. I have played others that offer free stuff for a limited time even if it was originally pay. 
---
Hey there, I‚Äôm working towards this build. I was just curious about weapons. Would you say bloodied is better than anti armor? I sold my bloodied Gatling gun when I got an anti armor and now I‚Äôm not sure that was the best choice. 
---
i thought that! I just wanted to make sure before i buy one, But not buying one now
---
That shit was 500 atoms?
---
[You mean one of those?](https://youtu.be/u4RcHQJBzr4) So you must have full asssasin gear (thats 40%damage reduction from players) with sentinel (75% reduced damage when standing) perks like dodgy. And then you just stand on place and kill everyone who comes to you. Like dick. Hopefuly we will have patch on this in 1254months.
---
Even if you aren't there for most of it as long as you are there at the end you get the rewards
---
They are going to make camps invulnerable in adventure mode.
---
I appreciate when developers aren‚Äôt scared to try something new because that‚Äôs how we get to the point where awesome games are created. I see the potential in an online fallout game which I believe will be amazing.  I understand that online games are built over time by adding content. The game wasn‚Äôt perfect at launch and should have been held back a couple of months to smooth out the bugs but I don‚Äôt think what I‚Äôm doing is hurting the industry in-fact if anything people like myself, by supporting a game like fallout 76, are giving developers more creative freedom in the type of projects they want to undertake. There are lots of people who enjoy a red dead redemption or an assassins creed but me I enjoy new concepts of franchises I love. I don‚Äôt like games that are essentially just a rehash of an earlier game or a franchise that has been made the same year in and year out because the developer is scared to take risk . That reality is very boring to think about. I have the freedom to spend my money how I choose on games that I like. As does everyone else who plays and enjoys fallout 76. I‚Äôm not going to try to kill a game to please a bunch trolls on the internet either. If you don‚Äôt like then don‚Äôt play it but in the end, if you are really a fallout fan, you‚Äôll be happy that there was someone like me to support this game because it‚Äôs going to be the best fallout ever made. üëèüëè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
---
Put it on one, see how you go. My brother loves his but he farms cores to run it, I only use power armor for nuke zones so its no biggy for me
---
The Lone Boner
---
It is. No more weirdos trying to bait you into pvp or high levels trolling lower levels. At least it isn‚Äôt as bad anyway. Now all they need to do is fix the FUCKING scorchbeasts.
---
As soon as your lvl 35 do the excavator armor quest line its so yellow i love it
---
This usually happens because she attempts an ability on a target but the target has had something happen or has been corrupted and forced her to travel outside of the map bounds. Sometimes the target location stays in the map bound just goes somewhere weird like the forest
---
Good points, but I don't think there's an issue with the third. I see people getting top 3 on the leader board and camping out in inaccessible places, but it's not like they're getting anything out of it. There's no reward for being top 3. If people want to stay in CAMP afk, I guess that's one way to cheese your way to the top and gain nothing.
---
Usually I just end up nuking those spots. Unless they're in an interior cell they're going to eat up rads.
---
Oh shit, It's April 1^st  I didn't even notice.
---
I wonder if they'll do anything.
---
u could spend hours just crouching rofl  
---
no btw, it is great to level up faster, just a lil bit faster, but u got the downside that you might get killed out of nowhere anytime.
---
i dont mind farming the fusion cores its the time it takes to find a mod like the jetpack. You need to be quite lucky to get one with the first few attempts. 
---
So, you're saying you want an "Anthem Mode"
---
They gave the Hunting Cap for free without any announcement. 
---
Banned for what?  And what does mule mean in this context?
---
Lore wise we don't want anyone coming here because it could spread the scorched plague even farther
---
The launch was a massive failure and right now there‚Äôs still a lot of work to be done, and the developers made a LOT of bad choices, took a long time to do what should have taken a fraction of the time. These are undeniable facts. The future looks promising but it definitely a disgustingly bad start.
---
I just bought the plans for T-60 at Watoga and made it
---
Great shot! I still need to get an Assaultron Helmet myself.
---
I have my CAMP within viewing distance of the overseer CAMP on the road and only had one person start destroying it. The other day I found out I can build directly across from the overseer CAMP (must be no more than 30 feet) so I moved there and setup a bar. I only wish I had more imagination as it's just a rectangle. I also need to figure out how conduits work so I can put a patio in top of the bar.

I knew a guy who carried 0 junk, was always overencumbered, and fast travelled by fragging himself and spawning on friends. The meta's been around for a while
---
Oh my god, i don't know, if i like it, or i want to kill myself.
---
yep, infortunately that's a daily routine
---
i'm only level 60\~ something despite having had multiple characters at 50 and spending more than 500 hours on the game. i guess a lot of that has been spent on building stupid shit
---
 If not for Skyrim, humanity would have become extinct and all restless Souls of Sovngarde would have been devoured by the Worlds-Eater. Somehow the Elder Scrolls are the most important thing in the entire Universe, but still no one really cares about them because like time, they just fly by and decorate some sort of dangerous place with high magic radiation.  The true thing whats the story about is: You are the chief, the masterrace, the hero of time that saved the world again and again and again. 
---
Does this sound familiar? Yeah.
---
 It will probably the same. But this time... You are not alone. You have friends. Family. Comrads. 
---
All residents of Vault 76 are the heroes that saved New America with its Republics and Raider Gangs, even Supermutans and Ghoul Undergrounds, just because they defeated huge green Bats. Maybe, just maybe even worse things, we don't know yet. West Virgina is truly a dangerous place, after not getting bombed at all, what a mysterious Mystery.
---
Realtalk: If this mainquestline goes on like this, i simply will not make it. I hope the Wastelanders DLC will bring some diversity and decisions into the game that ends this linear questing. I had very much fun with this game, until the point where i made the decision i'm gonna be a raider. 
---
And raiders don't give a fuck about this whole ''Find the Overseer, save the World'' thing.
---
Fallout 4 atleast had some very hard decision making in the end, but still ended very linear in the same ending whatsoever, but thats good? It is a singleplayer game with only one player. I can just reload and do the other endings. But in a Online Game? Pls. I very much see forward to the new dlcs and hope the game remains relevant for many years.
---
Feb 7th was almost two months ago.
---
Before somebody asks will that gets you banned the answer is no.
---
The way the banhammer works is that it searches for abnormalities to flag people. Milion nuka colas. 25 same TSEs.
---
The way it works also tends to "eat" multiple same legendaries. That can be a tricky situation when you are trading
---
I trade a lot and I build a gang. I'm gathering weapons not only for myself but for my gang. Doing lots of trades, its certainly possible to get a weapon you already have via trading. It was probably duped at some point but for me thats not super relevant as its not me who dupped it and I paid for each item I have with legit results of my playtime. The thing is if you buy another same stat weapon the game tends to eat one of the copies and leave you with a single one.
---
Also my take on post-duping economy in general. I'm very much into meta research. The extreme majority of the gear that was duplicated when duping was rampant is not what does the best job in PvP. The items I consider best tier as for now were often considered trash back then, not even entering the player market, sold to vendors.
---
I'll give you all a tip here to solidify my argument on why I think the economy ain't dead. Healing factor mutation increases the amount of passive healing effects, such as regenerating armor. Regenerating armor ceases to work in two conditions: there are PvE enemies currently focused on you, or there is an enemy player in about a 20 meter range. That means if the enemy player is shooting you from 25 meters distance, you are healing midfight. How much? I don't rely on stims at all in survival mode, that much. More than most people can hit me, and for the ones who hit me harder stimpacks wouldn't save me. Regenerating cavalier gear? Trash, people think. Can be bought for caps. Truth is its a godroll and a mandatory thing for all cavalier builds, at least one such piece. Renegerating sentinel is also very reasonable addition for many other builds but not as infinitely and indisputably crucial as it is for cavalier guys. Second tip: weapon market as it is now is ridiculous. Ignore it. Drop all previous assumptions. Retest all weapons. I'm still doing that and every day I discover a weapon that has been neglected previously and deemed useless that now serves some practical purpose and serves it great. Yesterday I shred unyielding sentinel guy in a moment using nonvats plasma flamer rifle with zero damage boost mods (I mean it had +50% vats crit damage but I didnt use vats so irrelevant).
---
That...that can't be it.
---
That immediately fixed it for me üëç
---
Last night someone nuked Charleston, was nice to go back there with some high level enemies. 
---
25 for the excavator qline.
---
That's a great shot!
---
Yea well there‚Äôs definitely a good number of people who have never played it or only played it for a minimum amount of time who think they know everything that this game is about. There are also a lot of people trying to use this as a lesson to Bethesda because they don‚Äôt like single player games at the expense of everybody who does. You know what if you like it play it, if it gets boring put it down and wait for something new to be added. This game is going to be around for a while. If don‚Äôt like even the idea of an online fallout game then don‚Äôt play it. This isn‚Äôt aimed at you bur to everyone who seems to take issue with people who actually enjoy this game like you or I. We can give the game criticism when it deserves and praise as well and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that at all. 
---
it'll be even more exciting if you could write a message on their wall..
---
I can't stand how arbitrary the scrapping system is. Why can't it simply work down the list one item after another? Why does it every now and again have to jump to a completely random item out of order of top to bottom?
---
1. Spawn camping is bad, i lost so much caps because of it....
---
2. Losing 400 caps on death is also crazy, if i die, i can't fastravel if i didn't kill more than 5people before. Being high level is so bad...
---
3. If i come across empty camp, i shot it once, to see if its owner come to have fight. If there is guy with bounty / scorebard leader camping, whole camp goes to ground.
---
4. You must know which people you have to avoid. They may be on open space, but [Immortal.](https://youtu.be/u4RcHQJBzr4)
---
I also hate that you can't server hop, so weekly challenge was nightmare.
---
I like that level 19 can easily put down level 200, i hate how much caps i pay per death. 
---
Worst thing is immortal and laggy people. 
---
The downside is damage drop off during the day. The benefit at night isn‚Äôt enough to make it a main option compared to any other viable legendary effect. The fact that it drops in day time is a huge downside already.
---
My ability to take timely photos isn't a quarter as good as this is. Great shot man!
---
Y'know, I thought they removed radstorms.  I haven't seen one since Beta.
---
Y'know, I thought they removed radstorms. I haven't seen one since Beta.
---
They are also guaranteed to be in the backroom of the Mothman Museum.
---
There again with the reckless rhetoric. You can be a fan of the franchise and still criticize it. If you're a "true" fallout fan you argue that this fallout warranted all of its criticism because of the audacity of releasing the game at that state. Bethesda games have never had great launches but FO76 you can tell they reeled in on people's goodwill. People like you who will still sing praise after they pull something like that only reinforces the incentive to do it again. 
---
April fools
---
Some players have extra accounts that they use to hold spare items since each player only has a fixed inventory space.
---
Do specific paint jobs add stats? Like military paint, does it add strength?
---
Could have played along with me :p
---
Thx, I'm always hunting for caps.
---
Well I think the dungeons are going to be added at the end of April and then the end game raids at the beginning of June. It‚Äôll probably take a month or so for you to get to end game so hopefully by then there will be more content. I‚Äôve had to make two characters at this point but that‚Äôs another thing I enjoy about the game, the character creation and perks are awesome. There are so many unique builds to play around with so I don‚Äôt mind rolling new characters while I wait for more content to be added all that much. I have a level 110 and 102 and am thinking about rolling a third one focused on stealth abilities.
---
Yes. I see a screw or a cap on the pavement when I'm walking to work and I feel like I've hit the jackpot. Eyeballing desk fans and lamps like I wanna take them apart, saw a bottle of wood glue yesterday that looked like economy wonderglue. At least we're ready for scavenging in a post apocalyptic wasteland, right?
---
This is basically thee rifle for bloodied stealth snipers. Put it up for auction, I bet it goes for at least 20k
---
Usually I‚Äôm down but it sucks to get all the way thru the silo and put the wrong code in and not have an extra keycard, it‚Äôs happened to me once and I can‚Äôt in good conscience let it happen to the OP. Sorry bruh 
---
I guess that makes it sad that I think it would be a good idea and make a challenge event as long as it's not PvP because people are assholes
---
I know I'm evil hehe
---
Only if that‚Äôs how you feel
---
I was exploring yesterday morning south of Charleston and entered a bar there. I went into it of course and located a set of Raider power armor. My level 13 character had a big sad over the fact that we couldn‚Äôt do anything with it, even after fighting the mole miner with the missile launcher. 
---
The next time I won‚Äôt call you out promise 
---
Mods, my Son. Believe in your Modding Community. Soon you will see them again. Huge bobs, Thomas the Train Scorchbeasts and most importantly the John Cena Rifle.
---
### 
---
Because, contrary to what lots of them claim, most of the "PVP players" on 76 didn't want PVP.  They wanted the ability be be an asshole all the time and claim they were "roleplaying a raider".
---
With slap damage gone and CAMP damage going away soon, they will probably just stop playing.  Their fun came from ruining the game for others.
---
The people that actually wanted PVP are playing PVP and monkeystomping the "raiders" and then they come here and complain that Survival mode is unfair.
---
It has problems from what I can see, but it's not "unfair".  They just thought they were Billy Badass but then on Survival they are meeting Billy Badass and they don't like losing.
---
I want one for pc too. Even just an instigating one. It's my fav weapon.
---
When is this slated to release?
---
Fiiine I'll wait till next year
---
And that results in bans?
---
Maybe they will delete it later from our inventory :D
---
Sometimes, if they get caught.
---
I am guessing you assume that Bethesda hasn‚Äôt been working on the game or not that many people have been devoted to fixing the bugs which I can assure you isn‚Äôt the case. They have an entire studio working on it and actually had to collaborate with several studios in order to get it to the point where it is now. The game has a pretty complex system for it being online. There are a lot of different variables that go into it to making the game function as a whole and it‚Äôs easy to trigger unintentional bugs by changing or fix something because of its complexity. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôve done that much but they most definitely have. It‚Äôs a balancing act that‚Äôs for sure. 
---
It all is dependent on what you want your character role to be, and every effect must synergise. Craftable mods must be part of the equation too. My build is supertanky mobile vatssniper platform capable of throwing out enough damage to kill other tanks without vats.
---
I'm getting called a cheater everyday.
---
For my character it is as follows, starting from armor:
---
3x assassin
---
1x regenerating
---
1x chameleon 
---
2x ap refresh (I want it to be 3x)
---
4x cavalier
---
1x sentinel
---
Craftable:
---
2x custom fitted (legs)
---
1x chest mod depending on the experiment - dense/asbestos/pneumatic
---
My favorite weapons are usually quad vats crit damage or quad explosives.
---
Yea their are quit a few. I actually think it would be nice if some of the later game mobs were introduced at the beginning because the early zones are not near as fun as the high level ones because of that. 
---
üñïüñïüñïüñï
---
Yeah, they've really been adjusting their prices lately. It's noticeable, just look at comparable items in the shop close to release vs. recently. Dunno if it's because of all the controversy about prices or if they only made things pricy to try to clean out people's free atoms
---
That would be better 
---
Yeah I refuse tp fast travel until I have the perk that makes fast traveling cheaper
---
Oh that map reminds me of addons in vanila/tBC world of warcraft. Cute.
---
Also yeah on PS4 there are not much survival server on morning there is only one, on peak more than three. 
---
I bought some things that went to sale days later. This is how capitalism work.
---
RNG gods be like, "I'll...allow it"
---
Group questing is mostly the party leader doing his quest, and everyone going along to help out. If everyone in the party hasn‚Äôt completed the quest yet, it can be completed together but each person has to grab their item at every location before moving on otherwise someone‚Äôs gonna get left out on credit but might still get the quest reward. Just not credit for doing the quest in his/her pipboy. What I would do is kind of take control of the party. Communicate what we are doing and make sure everyone has what is needed before moving on. 
---
Cavalier+assasin+streng  metal armor.
---
Yeah, on PC it's less "see glorious destruction" and more. "go blind for a minute seeing a nuclear rainbow" (starts off pure white, but as color starts coming back it's super intense so you see blues and yellows for a bit first).
---
You could also get one of the harpoon mods on an assault rifle. Made it super easy to scale buildings that were too high for the jet pack alone. 
---
Oh jfc not this whiteknight shit again. 
---
No
---
You can guarantee that? What? How? We know like literally nothing about it yet. 
---
Not sale, This is free.
---
I meant it feels bad. As a trader, I take more caps, period. And that feels good. 
---
So, releasing unfinished and broken garbage is "trying something new". gotcha
---
Because free ? 
---
That is actually a one of the many random drops from the technical data quest.
---
Do you scrap all your junk before you store it?
---
Were you scraping junk? Don't keeep armor/weapons you cant use. You will finde better anyway. Maybe throw away junk you have over 300.
---
Planned a Fasnacth marathon session, found emptiness.
---
Thats 100% sale. Isn't it?
---
I keep only 50 junk of everything other than springs, screws, steal, lead and ballistic fiber. Even then I am throwing stuff out to make room for other stuff. 800 lbs is all you ever get. Welcome to the real game, Stash limit simulator 76.
---
You won't learn mods that way, trust me I've tried 
---
Totally forgot that it was just the arms for mining ü§¶ I know I read that when I built my first set but absolutely forgot about it. Gonna just swap arms next time I'm hitting a mine instead of the whole suit, thanks üëç

Its Great !
---
Yep, learnt about this when I saw I had full items in the junk. I get paranoid with junk though since I never know what I'll need. 
---
With melee you can use the armor above and can run a bloodied build for more damage 
---
Make sure you are bulking your junk as well, can drastically help clear up storage space and allows you to keep your junk 
---
lvl 425 already
---
Well what do you expect? For them to admit the game didn't sell well? Ofc they will always say the game sold well and has a gagillion players playing. Anything other than this is a PR nightmare to deal with.
---
I honestly think that the average gamer is too stupid to notice :/
---
He's just another shill for Todd
---
Be it urban, or woodland or desert camos
---
What was a problem for me was the game lacked thrill. Past some point I could play it dumb and still be invincible. But they released survival mode and I can dive deep into pool full of sharks, bastards and spawncampers and the very action of doing what you can not to be killed made it a thousandfold more thrilling experience for me.
---
Enjoying something doesn't mean the game wasn't a hot garbage of bugs and problems. There are people out there that enjoy scat porn. Just saying' maybe this is your type of scat.
---
You must have not read anything I said. The game had problems but they‚Äôve fixed most of the bugs. I personally think some of it was hysterical though and I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks that. My friend who I finally got to play the game really lost faith in listening to anyone on the internet when judging a game because he doesn‚Äôt see the big deal that people are making about it online. He thinks it‚Äôs fun and enjoys playing it. Yea it has some bugs but they are no big deal at this point. The game is not done either. It needs a lot more content because where it stands right now there‚Äôs just not that much to do at end game however Bethesda has assured us that the content is on the way via the road map. I think the road map looks great and that they are covering all the bases that were concerns of the community.  So yea I am going to praise them for that and not giving up on the game. When more problems arise with the new updates such as balancing and future bugs I will let them know what I think by way of constructive criticism which a lot of the community has been pretty great at up until this point.
---
It's a trap!
---
No releasing an online fallout game is trying something new. 
---
Or.....we can get a perk card that reduces the costs....
---
This no longer works. They made that safe instanced a while ago.
---
Oh boy are you delusional. No, they are not FREE content. You already paid 60 - 90 EURO for the game. The content should have already been there. I am so sick of hearing this stupid nonsense. BUT MUH FREE CONTENT! no it is not free, they just market it that way to trick gullible idiots like yourself.
---
Chances are that you won't be able to re-link the launcher with a new game location. When you install something the program usually writes some data in the registry. That data uses the location where you installed the app initially. 
---
Copy pasting stuff may sometimes work but it's not recommended. It may also cause issues when updating the game in the future.
---
Just reinstall it to a new location or have fun manually editing all the fallout 76 registry entries...
---
If it ain't broke, don't fix it...
---
If you have played the other fallouts, don‚Äôt hoard everything that you find. 76 isn‚Äôt like that.
---
Don‚Äôt hold onto anything ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. Have a build with a few guns and stick to that. 
---
Not really. Ocassional visits of lvl60 Super Mutants, sometimes smaller guys like Liberators or some animals. Nothing the missile turrets can‚Äôt handle ;)
---
I was talking about the release of the game.
---
That might have been me. I always loot more than I need/can carry because hoarding itch, and I just give the excess to low-level folks. Two or three times a day I do a charity dump.
---
The game launched in a bad state theres no denying that but there are millions of people who are playing the game so there‚Äôs no denying that as well. Scat porn must be pretty popular. 
---
Nice! I'm on the point where I do crazy things like killing a SB with a Pipe Bolt-Action(and it works)
---
Still buggy, so no not really, unfortunately 
---
The other people are right. Bloodied is better than TS. You can run around at 70% health and get the same 25% bonus damage without the accuracy issues and with better actual damage after mobs armor.
---
Well No Man's Sky did it (Bastards) No reason why Bethesda shouldn't follow suit.
---
It is what it is. There‚Äôs not much you can do about it at this point so for me I think it‚Äôs time to move on and look to the future. Trust me I‚Äôve had my fair share of criticism at launch as well but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not going to be optimistic going forward.
---
Pit boy?? 
---
You have no clue how many people are playing. Millions is a lie, Todd lied to you. If millions were playing it you would constantly have full servers, while in REALITY, the 24 player cap is not even reached in every single instance you join. lol Get a grip and stop living in Todd Dreamland.
---
I'd love it if all these level 300 guys pissed their pants if they lose everything in the game. It might even things up.
---
Here we are born to be kings
---
Um, not in a list, but every vender shows what you know from what they sell, any you pick up will show known if you already have it. If you find one it will say known next to it's name if you know it. So on....
---
Only lead and aluminum bulking saves space, the rest wastes plastic, and that's the "savings" you're seeing. 
---
How much will you pay?
---
I play on PS4 and have been greifed numerous times, you've been lucky 
---
Just hit level 30 feel like put in 100 hours! Great game though 
---
I don‚Äôt trade too often so I don‚Äôt really know the going rate of items, how much would you accept for one?
---
This. You don't need a mini gun if your over 20. In time you will know exactly where to get one. Only keep legendary wepons and armor. Everything else is trash. 
---
Some day they will fix it so the Rifleman perks apply to it.
---
In terms of underarmor, only the Military Fatigues and the BOS Fatigues come to mind... the former is mostly green, the latter gray.
---
Autoshitter came in action Pip Boy
---
there are walls you can't destroy
---
There is an event at Tyler county theme park or something like that and the event has you kill 3 alphas all 1 star. All I did was server hop 2hrs and got 19 in that amount of time. 
---
I presume that you are aware that the unique "skin" of that Minigun becomes a garden variety one upon picking up?
---
I‚Äôm not sure you understand what I said or why. I said your statement is stupid because it‚Äôs purely anecdotal and not based in any facts. It has nothing to do with whether what is said is true or not, simply that your ‚Äúproof‚Äù to support your claim is unprovable and not proof because it‚Äôs purely anecdotal. As demonstrated in the example I gave with measles. 
---
I really don't now why, but somehow I just imagine everyone pulling out lightsabers at this point and having some kind of appropriately scored battle :) Awesome pic!
---
Deathclaw gauntlet wi5h blodied u can go up to 2000 dmg easily
---
Ill give it a shot, thanks
---
At the beginning when the game launched and storage space was smaller, i used to keep 100 of every junk/component and like people already said, kept one or two weapons. I had no storage problems what so ever. Always scrap junk items you put in your stash.
---
Later on in the game you will learn what to keep and hoard and what not to. Basicly salvage you need to repair your gear, create your ammo etc etc. You can use component view in inventory to mark those components for searching.
---
Well, steam has change install location and verify, so it's easy to change.
---
I just do not want my drive to look bad. 
---
No I do not! Haven't googled any of the goodies yet, want it all to be a surprise after spoiling fo4 for myself
---
Only junk that you may need tones of are Plastic, steel, wood, lead and those are easy farmable. When stash was 400 i keeped max 100 of every junk and it was good, don't be scared to sell/drop if you have too much of something.
---
Then don‚Äôt play the game then you dumbass. Go spend your euros on some European game about having swords shoved up your ass by royalty or ugly peoples living in a foggy land by the sea. 
---
&gt; They just thought they were Billy Badass but then on Survival they are meeting Billy Badass and they don't like losing. 
---
This exactly sum up the whole survival mode, most players that thought they were good in pvp at adventure mode got brutally crushed in survival.
---
even the assassin sentinel assholes are fucking afraid to come to survival mode anymore lol 
---
I did it in 20hours and it was super frustrating as i could not find las one legendary in 4hours. 
---
If you could server hop, and there was egouth servers. Uranium fever and leader of pack events have each 3x legendary that counts, but for me server hoping on survival put me every time on same server.
---
We can get a core if the plant is not powered up?
---
..if you're like me you'll find a good number of mini nukes and missiles in your stash, which weigh a ton. we tend to keep those "just in case" but rarely use them. ask yourself if you REALLY intend to use them. I just chucked 5 mini nukes yesterday and saved 30 lbs in my stash.
---
Oops, apologies for spoiling it for you then.
---
Hey, at least I have spared you the disappointment I felt I guess? 
---
Oh really? Damn thought I was actually saving space 
---
Dude I play the game all the time and the servers are full. I even server hope to different servers to farm mats, still they are all full of people. Hell when doing the nuka quantum X-01 paint quest I had to hope from server to server for hours it seemed like because they were all full of people trying to do the same quest. What‚Äôs the point of lying about that? It‚Äôs like you people have turned Todd Howard into this fictional villain and Bethesda an evil faceless corporate that only cares about profit when in reality these people just want to create video games that people enjoy.
---
I‚Äôll invite you. Welcome to the guardians
---
Lmao bro dont worry about it had crossed my mind it might be... are you on ps4?
---
Thanks! Just what I needed!
---
Ironically, even though the only reason most of the assholes wanted FO76 to fail is because it's made by Bethesda, I think the only reason it didn't is because it's made by Bethesda. A company like EA that only cares about monetisation would've scrapped it months ago.
---
Sure. Are you running a bloodied build?  I have a two shot gauss and I‚Äôve managed to get it up to 341 damage but no bloodied. I mostly use vats/crits and frankly I‚Äôm not sure how to calculate my damage after all those bonuses go into effect 
---
Thank you for removing the slap damage!! It was the single most annoying thing people were semi-exploting. It was driving me up the wall.
---
Ive been trying Wes Tek as it has 2-3 legendaries, but only the first time did it have starred ones. 
---
As for server hopping, it takes a few tries sometimes, but yea, there isnt enough people playing so theres very few servers to begin with.
---
Crossbow needs some love. Got a quad +25% crit damage, -VATS cost crossbow that longs to be useful.
---
Get chemist and super duper, farm the abandoned shack and the wood mill directly in front of vault 76 for ticks blood. Join another server and repeat the process, make a bunch of blood packs, then make a billion stims. I‚Äôve got about 80 stims on me!
---
It should be 200 ammo produced per craft, double 5mm ammo.
---
I would rather have some type of LFG system in place. Group up with people who are looking to do something specific. In my personal experience that is all things like gen chats are good for anyway. Otherwise they tend to just turn into people arguing all the time. Although it might be necessary to have depending on how complicated the dungeons and vault clearing get, especially if people don't have a headset
---
Yeah it just needs some good mods
---
For what the power armor? I been learning guns and regular armor mods thks way. I just pop a berry mentas and raise my INT score and been learning new stuff. I wouldnt be surprised if the end game stuff like a harden 50cal sniper mod can not be taught from this bust average mods should be fine and solid.
---
There‚Äôs two really big clues. One is the title wasterlanders and the next is in the description where it says there will be choice and consequences. I mean what else could it be? They said it‚Äôs the biggest most ambitious update as well. Don‚Äôt you think that trying to make the game have these kinds of quest would be something they aspired to do? It sounds about right to me. 
---
I think what OP is getting at is there are plenty of people selling plans and it‚Äôd be nice to be sure you have something before jumping servers to buy. I don‚Äôt commit to buying any plans anymore until I can initiate a trade menu first... for those instances it would be nice to have a list. 
---
Yeah what OP said! I'm running a DCG Bloodied with SS and +1 Strength, can hit the 2500 mark with the right perks and aids 
---
Then wait until Fo76 gets released on steam. 
---
It's just a beta. Expect something more structured in the future
---
I believe it‚Äôs called Leader of the Pack, IIRC.  Near Tyler dirt track
---
Thanks I‚Äôm going to download it again and try it out for myself! 
---
I remember after I preordered 76 tricentencial edition about a week and the whole game went on sale for 20 bucks less. I didn't complain since I bought it early and probably enjoyed the game earlier than others. So don't feel too bad ! We've all been through the similar things before.üòÇ
---
Most definitely. I‚Äôm surprised EA hasn‚Äôt pulled the plug on anthem yet and closed BioWare studios. Hopefully it‚Äôs doing better than it seems as well for BioWares sake. 
---
use shop paint to have an icon next to it
---
Nope, currently looking for a Bloodied or Junkies Gauss, but at the moment I only have a standard modded GR and I get the damage boost from Adrenal Reaction -- I can take a screencap of my perks when I get home.
---
Yeah I really dislike that the game doesn't give you numbers in each &amp; every case when you have a damage modifier (or then it's bugged like Class Freak modifier is).
---
I think youre right on the name. Any chance you know how frequently it takes place? Im scouring around there now
---
Military fatigues are green, Brotherhood fatigues are kinda urban-camo style.
---
What are you planning to wear over them, if I might ask? I'm running with a mixture of Combat Armour and Leather Armour in various flavours of heavy and sturdy, all of which has the camo paint applied.
---
It looks really good with the Forest Operative Underarmour and the Road Leathers. If you have the operative underarmour and the Brotherhood Field Scribe hat, I think it gives a real 'Endor Commando' from Return of the Jedi look! xD
---
Best drop you had gotten at the time? That better than anything I have ever gotten lol
---
I'm just saying man, it's not like it was free right after release or something. Besides, you can earn atoms rather than pay for them, and 500 is really not that difficult to get back.
---
Just so you know, the BOS Paint for the Combat Helmet is just a cosmetic change.  The BOS Mods for Arms, Legs, and Chest are actual DR/ER increasing mods, and while technically they do dye them blue and add BOS Emblems, they aren't actually paint jobs for the armor, but mods you apply to them.  The Paint slot is still open to be used by other Combat Armor paints.
---
Exactly my point, I have enough trouble trying to get people to understand what I want right now with just the emotes, I can't imagine having to do a raid with only emotes for communication. I mean I suppose a team could use a separate form of communication like Skype or something, or if one or two of your team has a mic then just assign them as the leaders and follow orders. 
---
Literally I thought the sentry bot was gonna be hard but I two shoted it and the turrets are super annoying but imma just hack them on the terminals 
---
Just server-hop if there is no event there, it shows up quite often in my game. Like 1 out of 3-4 server-hops.
---
‚Äîclose
---
They said that all future dlc content will be free
---
More people joining or coming back for a SPECIAL EVENT? Wow, who would have thought? LOL delusional kid
---
1k caps if max level. In general most 1* are vendor crap but a few prefixes are worth a little caps. Instigating is one of those.
---
1000 caps or so, depending on what you can haggle with the person.
---
Yeah I figured. Thanks for the help
---
Exactly.
---
so there's no issue to get EU version of disc rather than US version, right?
---
Last time Todd was on camera, he was talking about survival sesons like in diablo 3
---
That would be really cool, thank you.   I did recently put on adrenal but I‚Äôm conflicted on it.  When I use power armor I don‚Äôt really have an issue with dying at low health but outside of PA, I get cracked wide open. I‚Äôm not super stealthy. I love my rifles so much but I should probably switch to automatics considering how I play. 
---
Not that I'm aware of. But I'd wait for other people to reply so they can confirm it 
---
Ooh nice!
---
They just *increased* the rates so a reduction is not going to happen.
---
Planning on either combat or leather like you, I might go for full heavy leather
---
I hope so! Hopefully this week's inside the vault will have more info
---
Alternatively, take a screenshot on the xbox of the photo in your gallery, then access it using the app on your phone and you can save it directly to your phone :) 
---
Patch 8 notes
---
These are right from the website..
---
CUSTOMIZE YOUR GEAR WITH ITEM RENAMING
---
We‚Äôve read feedback from many players in the Fallout 76 community who would like to add a more personal touch to their gear and, with Patch 8, we‚Äôre adding the ability to rename your items. You can do this by choosing the ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù option when viewing an item in your Pip-Boy, and then selecting the new ‚ÄúRename‚Äù option. The name you enter will be displayed in place of the item‚Äôs default name in your inventory. You can rename items as many times as you like, but your custom names will not transfer with the item when viewed by, or transferred to, another player.
---
I wish I could say no - it would be awesome if we didn‚Äôt! 
---
Only weapon that ever oneshoted me in survival was fatman. If they have full sentinel/assasin they are immortal anyway, but againts normal players is good even non-legendary handmade. You need weapon with decent damage and fast fire rate, because slow realoading sniper rifles are too risky.
---
I had about the same experience until just recently. Now my main has around 10k caps on him. I think doing the Fasnatch event over and over (around 30 times) helped a lot.
---
But also using the perk for caps stashed. But even more, i stopped buying plans because i have all that mattered the most to me.
---
Not sure.  ‚òπÔ∏è Server hopping needed, most likely.  Be sure to be in the area while hopping in case it needs someone nearby to trigger.   I think it triggered for me when I was between the park and the dirt track.
---
From what I understand you cannot transfer fo76 on Bethesda launcher to steam launcher. But I thank you for the responses. 
---
On Xbox I regularly sell 1* level 45 instigating lever actions for 1.6 to 1.8k and have seen them go for 2k. 
---
For a sneak sniper build even a 1* is a really powerful weapon. 
---
Shame that you couldn‚Äôt get glass to make scopes with.
---
Probably never, the fuel tanks need to work like fusion cores
---
Lol nah its way more complicated 
---
I've seen the opposite. 3* Mirelurk King and we each got 2 1* low level armor. Both of us were high level players.
---
Hope soonüôè
---
God I know. Unless I am looking for a specific plan I will just ask the person to bring all their plans. Then I figure it out in the trade window. It's just too hard and too many to keep track of which you have and which you don't.
---
Or just split them in half and duct tape them on!
---
I agree. Someone tag the devs
---
Yeah instigating is definitely on of the better sniper effects. If you do trading a lot is a 1* instigating lever a good trade for a 1* unyielding marine armor?
---
Seasons are generally 3 months.  If they were only a month long they would be monthly.  Spring summer fall winter... You know, seasons.
---
I just started a new character and i can tell that it take her way more time to get from say Morgantown to Charleston because his AP run out faster.
---
It happens out of vats too, also with npc‚Äôs
---
It's worse if you have your inventory sorted something other than default alphabetical.  If you have it sorted weight, dmg, value, etc, it completely reorganizes the order of the items with the same sort values each time your inventory changes.  If you have it set to default alphabetical it just goes up or down one slot.
---
So, if a bounty was set,  then it had to be collected right when he was killed, right?
---
Not sure never done it before.
---
Good suggestion OP
---
Oh the dungeons and raids will be separate maybe I need to go back to the road map.
---
Very excited, can‚Äôt believe this game is only ¬£6.70! 
---
I saw the plans for crossbow, no mods available when it‚Äôs lvled?
---
Shielded mod for BOS Underarmor is a rare drop from Tech Data turn ins.  Other than buying it from another player, that's the only source.
---
BOS Mods for Combat Armor are very rare random spawns in the world.  Can spawn in containers, in fixed locations, etc.  There is not permanent source or way to buy them from vendors anymore.
---
I have found _one_ since the vendor change update.  And I play an average of 3 hours every day.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7tqcs/for_the_first_time_since_the_vendor_plan_update_i/
---
If there is mods at all its very limited ones.
---
Terrible behaviour on his part. Good job you realised. If you add someone in the game then go to ur social or friends list u can also see if they're in adventure or survival. If they're survival they'll have a little campfire next to there name
---
Good spot mate
---
That is what I noticed...u can't find them anymore after the patch.
---
The combination mentioned above is indeed making you tough but its at most 3rd tier items now and the meta has evolved much further. The above sentence has been proven time and time again in artificial testing and in real world PvP. I also think that they in fact already did something to the most powerful armor perks, I now suppose its a legendary effect penetration that has been added to certain weapons but I wont bet my hand on it like I could for assassin/sentinel being 3rd tier.
---
That seems a pretty fair trade. 
---
Farm power armour parts from watoga test it , maybe they changed it
---
Ok thanks guess I just keep grinding and hope rng is in my favor. üëçüèΩ
---
So, you agree everyone is wanting an explosive tips as well ? Lolz
---
Could say the same for syringers..
---
Also this shouldn't be happening because you can tell if someone is in survival. Survival has a campfire next to their name in social tab, it's also good sense to check for that now
---
didn't realise that Cheers üëçüëç
---
It was supposed to go on sale, but totally free was unexpected and nice!

Executioners, explosive handmade rifle. Max commando perks with tank killer, bloody mess, etc. berry mentats, assassins and sentinel armor.
---
Now you are just about unstoppable
---
I was level 45 when i downed my first SB, but with the help of the WS robots.
---
Later, i participated in my first queen event. I was only on the site near Watoga because i needed flux ingredient for a Biv daily. 
---
When the queen felt, it was cool, but i had no loot from her body.
---
You can do it on pc too. Right click the person GT from the map..
---
That could be interesting. I was thinking more +armor piercing tips and +damage tips.
---
My friends and I use team speak, but we also pay for our server. There are plenty of other options out there like discord that are free though. Depending on how involved the raids are you might want to pick up a headset anyway. Raids in games like destiny are nearly impossible without voice chat, but if bethesda handles their raids bosses like the SBQ, you won't need to communicate with your team anyway lol
---
Alright thanks!
---
Not now, unfortunately. Paints jobs are just visual as of now
---
Chameleon exploit is the strongest thing out there right now.
---
It‚Äôs quite common, especially in whatever lobbies I‚Äôm in.
---
Why was that not mentioned?
---
Stayed tuned for today's Wasteland Hoarders episode can the stars of the show help this vault dweller before it's to late or will they end up over encumbered and unable to run or fast travel 
---
Some pre-made interesting structures would be great for theming camps. Great idea. Even if it was a bunch of in game pieces they could add; wargon cart (for farmers), raider objects etc.
---
I wouldn't use the Bazaar, it's unregulated, full of dupers, scammers, and I guess thieves now. They only have one mod who isn't active, so no way to get any sort of retribution when you do get scammed
---
Hey I have not said a word to return ATOM. Please listen to the reason.
---
I also went there yesterday, it's south eastish of morgantown
---
That‚Äôs not immortal. That‚Äôs a Sentinel Assassin set.
---
They‚Äôre only possible to kill with critical shots and radiation damage.
---
I‚Äôm aware about these issues. I personally didn‚Äôt have any problems with it but I‚Äôve heard and seen people having problems. 
---
Began to nope out where I saw all the cat bowls in the kitchen and mounted heads haha. 
---
It‚Äôs complicated. Pacifist mode is recommended. If you accidentally hit someone and if PvP is triggered it starts to damage even after you turn pacifist back on. 
---
I'm on a streak of being called a cheater for last few days. I'm yet to meet a guy that woukd be actually invincible, I'm close to it in legit ways but true invicibility is fake news. The thing is not every weapon will work against every build and there are certain builds that allows you to ignore damage from certain sources. For example the way my character is organised, if you plan to kill me by taking my damage in quick succession of not-super-powerful hits then you can forget you'll do anything because I'll outheal what it could do me. At the same time when I see an opponent with some certain weapons or very specific movement styles I just run cause I can't fight them when they see me. Also, yesterday I took a very specific energy weapon thats largely ignored, and I ate an unyielding-sentinel build in a moment without resorting to vats. The weapon itself had no legendary damage modifiers (it was quad vatscritdmg, but I used no vats and less than 1/4 of quad magazine) so pretty much I already confirmed a kill on such godbuild via a craftable weapon.
---
Why you mad dude? Just because I told him the truth? I don‚Äôt care what you have to think so stop wasting your time.
---
No unfortunately. Piece plans are available through random event rewards and through treasure maps.

I use the Bunker Buster due to its 20% increased damage output and the fact that it "chambers" three missiles that you can fire in short succession and target locks. I don't want to sell it and I'm scared to try and put it in my stash as I have Bear Arms maxed and it only weights like 2lbs in my inventory... Tbh whilst the auto grenade launcher looks cooler, the Bunker Buster is better than the auto grenade launcher as it auto locks on. With the right perks it can be ok
---
I'm a level 98 and it happened to me yesterday I got on the server and went to sell some top hats at whitesprings when I got the message that my base was being attacked went back immediately and half of it was gone all my water purifiers crops my bed but they left the generators
---
Nope, PC, sorry. 
---
All the plastic...
---
You are at least crouched down. I forget if there is an animation or not
---
PvP has always been first shot wins. Was the same back when TSE was a thing. Now it's glitched damage handmades and meat hooks with both running stealth boys. As far as a bloodied build does in pve, well after you get used to the dying and learn how to avoid it, it's great. The damage is excellent and you learn to be faster. Still going to die a lot though.
---
Thanks 
---
Just had one work doing it that way today. I guess it‚Äôs just buggy like everything else and works when it wants to.
---
I was going through our base's main gate yesterday and while the vehicle in front of me was being inspected i saw a blue plastic milk crate on the ground by the MP's and it had a pack of unopened duct tape.
---
 I was like "duct tape! Oh hell yeah! My main gun needs fixing!" Not realizing I said it all out loud, the MP's looked at me and said "uh uh. No! You take that gun to the armory and get it checked out" while the other said "I'd advice you do not fire that weapon or any of your weapons for that matter if that is how your "fixing" them, with duct tape" 
---
As i pulled forward both were looking me in the eye attentively, probably trying to see if my eyes were dilated, upon checking my badge they politely asked "are you okay sir?"  So i said yes i am, i just realized how much i play fallout 76 and explained how precious duct tape is in that world. 
---
Thats when one of them said " well, can't you just TGM? Thats what i do right now in F04" 
---
LoL this world we live in.....
---
You raise a compelling argument to go back.. Particularly as a new player.
---
ü§î
---
The perk doesn't have a card set up for it, and having read through what's available for the questline it doesn't seem like dogs come up in it at all. 
---
I did play survival for few hours (30+) and i must say, that only weapon that oneshoted me was fatman. And i met only two guys who didn't take any damage from me. 
---
I noticed that as well.
---
It happens, especially with the multi-star enemies. It is extremely rare, but it happens. I didn't believe it at first when I read that they can drop multiple legendaries on the Wikia for Fallout, but somewhere after 450+ hours played I got one of those kills as well. I guess it is the Jackpot on the Loot-RNG.
---
I had I guy try griefing me with (I assume) a be shotty, so I stepped close and he killed himself with the splash damage. 
---
Hilarious.
---
Just wondering but why use the drum mag on your handmade instead of the penetrating magazine which ends up giving around a 20% dmg boost?
---
With the right stagger perks sentinel doesn‚Äôt matter, and I didn‚Äôt see him staggering you at all so of course you didn‚Äôt die.
---
When headshot damage does nothing to you, you are immortal. This shouldn't be thing.
---
The outfit is from the Atom store, I'm not sure if it is still available though
---
Bobby pins display weight of 1 pound each.
---
Thanks. Always good to have more options to dress my character. Especially when it's free.
---
Leader of the pack, Uranium Fever, and monster mash usually have 3 legendaries per event. Also Awol armaments, and hordes usually have 1 as the leader. If you are at wes tek, you can check huntersville and the nearby satellite dish location nearby (cant remember the name rn), they occasionally have legendary mutants as well. Also check around watoga, the random bots around there can be legendaries, i got my last 5 legendary kills there in about 30 minutes and it is really easy if you have done the quest that makes them non hostile towards you
---
Biv complains about an arrow to the knee.
---
Someone at Bethesda is getting fired today.
---
I've decided that for my new current character I'm going to go nothing but leather and the vault suit.  Let's hope I can maintain it
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I like to carry a lot of spoiled veg because I‚Äôm positive that what people want to loot off of my dead corpus. Everyone loves 1 tenth of a fertiliser.  
---
What did you even need to do to get it?
---
.. I wish.
---
Truth is? The game was ~~rigged~~ shit from the start.
---
See if you can ride it like a flying carpet?
---
This has been a thing, and it‚Äôs likely  not going anywhere.
---
Learn the counters.
---
Im selling all 3 heavy combat armor plans on xbox for 15k if someone is interested.
---
Animation for doors, don‚Äôt think there is one for containers 
---
Ps4 as well. My keyboard is collecting dust.
---
Im totally agree with you mate. Lol
---
Ohh, you're finally awake.
---
Xb1 has gotten worse üòí
---
There was another guide here on reddit comparing DPS values between bloodied and AA builds. If I remember correctly bloodied comes on top, but aae stuff is not too far behind. I really like the benefits from full unyielding armor builds, but for pvp and more aa builds are just as good in damage potential 
---
Haha üòÑ
---
Thank you as well, if anything it‚Äôs the support from people like you that keeps me going. 
---
Why assuming people who want PvP are asshole ??  It's not to be an asshole to contest workshop. Or chase someone. It's a different style of gameplay.  Why use this world ?
---
That‚Äôs a good point, I haven‚Äôt tested it actually. Maybe you would like to test it and share the results with us?
---
I find the very concept of being unable to enter through such window ridiculous. The only change I support would be adding a chance of damaging yourself upon such entry.
---
Thanks rebel, I appreciate it a lot. I have an extra t45 set if you want we can mod it for you
---
Ferguson is the Xbox guy, I‚Äôm the PS4 guy, we are still looking for a capable PC guy to make the trio
---
i have heard, but not tested that a good ledg. gama gun makes short use of a bloodied build ? (insta kill)
---
I have one of those gama guns, but i don't pvp :)
---
I put so much effort onto this, it‚Äôs longer than I expected but hopefully it‚Äôs for the good. Many thanks
---
Works for collision course or back on the beat or feed the people if you nuke Morgantown. All enemies should spawn at max level and glowing. 
---
Thats plastic farm #3. (Watoga and morgantown HS being #1&amp;2)
---
I hope so. The game would probably benefit from more survival and more variation. I'm an active player, but bored at this point. Haven't died in months.
---
Those are very good points. That is similar to what I do as well, I have 6 active sets that I‚Äôm using but I keep some coiled torso and stealth boy torso in my inventory just so that I can switch on demand
---
I bought it for less than $10 on some 3rd party key reseller and I don't regret it. After updates this game is really fun. I wish my friends would try it too, the sooner the better because I'd love to play with them. I can see that people who paid $60 could be upset when game was released but now it is playable, I guess
---
Interesting. Just been playing over a week. Evidently I'll be going back. Bulking and shotgun shells has run me dry. 
---
I dont wanna sound like a negtive nini but they are right, we dont know anything concrete about it yet, if i was going to place money on it, i would say it will add NPCs, but i cant garuntee it will.  Nothing is certain in this world no matter how sure you are
---
Plastic heaven + the high school with plastic pumpkins üéÉ near by, a stalwart location for shotgun users. 
---
I love all the cat heads on the walls grinning at us üò∫ 
---
It works for me, don‚Äôt know whether it didn‚Äôt work before but it‚Äôs really a clutch piece with the added marking benefit  
---
Yeah, a few comments have mentioned the plastic. I'm a new player and until I ran out of plastic I was also using shotguns. XD
---
I'll have to venture back over. 
---
It‚Äôs a long time bug, yes, when you log out and log back in inside an excavator set, you gain extra 100 carry weight. Don‚Äôt know when they‚Äôll fix it but they will probably at some point
---
I'm on PS4 and the last few days area chat and team chat have not been working right.  We end up starting a party just so we can talk when we team up. 
---
For me starting fresh gets more boring than have 100% charracter just for afking around.
---
Maybe increase fast travel cost per level and it caps at 50? After a certain point caps are present in overabundance, but I remember refusing to fast travel anywhere other than my or my teammates camps when I was low level because I had to make due with 200 caps a day. (I didn't know that there were other vendors than the responders)
---
Going to have to try this. Stuck at 0/10 since forever.
---
These are great questions. I‚Äôm not good with math about how exactly does it work with regards to damage resistance and so on, but all I can say is that you still take damage no matter what, and most probably 50% of the incoming damage is reflected back.
---
Get 3 more consoles and make them your in game minions. 
---
I think so, yeah. They roughly save up 2.5% of AP for each power attack per arm. This should differ according to your special stats as well
---
Very nice. I've been considering moving to that spot (on PC)
---
Most enemies don‚Äôt drop what they carry is what I‚Äôve noticed. I thought Bethesda said they fixed it a while ago but obviously they didn‚Äôt 
---
Not if they make a foundation camp 
---
Can‚Äôt break floors 
---
And the high school scorched have shells also üëç sometimes, great location.
---
Smart choice, there is nothing against it. Thank you for your contribution 
---
That's a long list...  and we get new ones weekly as they update the game every Thursday.  Biv &amp; Fasnacht were great.  And there are new ones planned for the next several months, with others likely to come.
---
Again... do you play it?
---
Theyre all under 5 haha
---
My tests suggest that blue and purple are the weakest ones, weaker than the stock one. That should add up to stealthiness probably
---
But you just switch charachters until your buddy can log in later and collect. Bounties should be refunded to the guy that set them if you log out before death
---
Heavy Combat plans or BOS mod plans?   Cause Heavy Combat plans can be acquired thru vendors for less than 1000 caps each.  
---
Tricentennial paint. My favorite on T51b. 
---
Yeah it's stupid.  Been looking for a super sledge.  Here comes a super mutant with a super sledge.  Kill him.  Loot him.  Combat knife drop. Wtf
---
My favorite uninstanced plastic spot!
---
This isn't your typical PVP game, infact it isn't your typical game in general.  Don't expect to be running and gunning in a post apocalyptic game. You're the hunter and you can also become the hunted. Stealth is key.  Stealth will almost always be key for survival.  would it be fun to be a crazy mega tank running around like a mad man? yeah, probably. This is a post apocalyptic game though and that will only attract a lot of attention and you will be hoarded. Bloodied makes sense if you;re going to be stealthy and it is indeed high risk high reward which is what most pvp should be about. 
---
If nothing else it‚Äôll stop me from accidentally scrapping it..
---
As a recent convert to cryolating the queen, with a playing buddy who has a TSE cryo from the olden days, and myself having picked up a \*\*\* ghoul slayer's cryo this weekend myself, I find it difficult to balance the amount of acid needed to keep your crystal supply up, with the amount of acid needed to keep your lead supply up, while also running gatlings and .50s as your main battle cannon.
---
I have been part of s nukes one violent night event and it did spawn loads of glowing ones
---
No you can't? You can mute, fast travel, invite to team etc but there is no way to send text messages currently.
---
I meant the BOS mod plans.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been five years, why have you brought us here.‚Äù
---
Yes! Lol this is what I meant. 
---
The hunting cap flap down clips through my characters head which was a major disappointment, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have worn it anyways because I hate the bald look it gives you at the front, the flaps up tho.. is bomb.
---
I've used almost nothing but heavy leather so far and I just hit lvl 54 :) I just crafted and scrapped lvl 1 leather arms to learn all the mods, then bought the heavy plans from Charleston, I think? I rely on stealth, so if I'm going toe to toe with a mob, something has gone very wrong, but I rarely find items with better stats than my studded heavy gear :)
---
I just really like the looks of both those armour sets :)
---
I've seen upcoming golden /silver handmade skins in a datamining post (not April fools)
---
This is more important than the skins. But i would like both!
---
Yes There is. At least for team play. I see my teammate always crouched and picking the lock in safes and lockboxes
---
Not through Xbox Live which is what OP mentions. On console you can send an invite outside of the game to join. No way to see what game mode they are in. 
---
Sellers. You make the rules. If someone won‚Äôt come to you, they are scamming. Always switch servers before fast travelling so you can check the server type and not get spawn killed.
---
yup, that's the one i am referring to, looks really good, i use my handmade all the time ;)
---
I dont know, have a friend who's bloodied/melee try and test it out. 
---
I appear offline so grinders can't come and attack my CAMP from joining my Xbox profile. Yes it happens. 
---
Shoot me a message on xbox live and I'll send you one back if I'm on. Usually on at night. 
---
iirc, if you play console, discs aren't region locked anymore. Correct me if I'm wrong though.
---
there's a gold one, a  silver one and a combined gold and silver, like the looks of the last neste :)
---
Same ! those are instant buy for me. Let's hope it'll come sooner !
---
Yes, this.  Why are they here?  If this brings you joy, then I get why you hated Fallout 76.  Co-op ganes are not for you.  Especially if you can only co-op griefing, because the griefing fot nerfed.
---
They fixed that too.  You can come back to Fallout and try to hunt the fanboys in Survival ;-)  do what you do online, and stalk people to harrass.
---
Only the prime 'frame'. That's it.
---
I long for a port of Crossbows of the Commonwealth; even though the mod is considered dated is still leagues ahead of the 'official' crossbow we got in 76.
---
Pretty sure you could still accidentally scrap with this in place, but like fallout 4 you could just name it something with brackets, a number or indication and you would be less likely to do so if it‚Äôs at the very top or very bottom of your inventory
---
I posted about this a couple days ago. People are baiting with free stuff, help leveling, or buying junk at awesome prices.
---
Sellers be suspicious and feel free to cancel a deal or let the other player know you are spooked and want to meet alone at your camp or something. Legit buyers won‚Äôt mind, but scammers will get super passed and pushy.
---
Also beware of people not trading alone. People have been adding me to team, but then coming to trade with someone else following not on the team. BEWARE. They are going to slap each other forcing you hostile as you are teamed, then kill you for the junk the said the we‚Äôre buying.
---
The 3* that are max level are around 8 -10 k, I have a 3* lvl 40 that was my pride and joy of my last build,(sniper) I switched to melee.and don't need it,
---
They wouldn't try to shove 24 into each because people often want to join their friends.  
---
That would be bad design to make people wait...  remember Battlefront 1?  That sucked waiting 10-15 minutes to join you friend because the server was full.
---
Good idea, but technology isnt there yet. 
---
the question is whether they will continue to give content, or end everything as abruptly as in fallout 4 
---
I think its comical seeing a scorched wielding  minigun. Pop his head off and loot that combat shotgun!?
---
I don't think new players cause respawn anymore. We've tested it several times. I've entered the zone before for the first time and everything was dead. Nothing but glowing bodies everywhere. 
---
Nice 
---
Will second that, haven't crashed in weeks.  And that wasn't inherent game instability, it was people crashing it to duplicate items.  Ideally it should have been caught or fixed earlier, and crazy frustrating, but fixed.
---
Then the creeoy shit has only just started.
---
I second that. Got 84 kills day one in survival with that build though i only have vanguard chameleon pieces. 
---
There is a lot more that i would like to see explored as well, outside of the scorched. What's happening in the vaults obviously. Especially since it seems the strangler vines originated in 94.
---
More on interloper, and the cryptids in general. I know there is info about some of them as wes tek, but I'd like more story involving them and the cults built around them.
---
The Enclave generally. Since they would have been in the bunker, it doesn't seem like the scorched would have wiped them out. Maybe something about how they left for the oil rig or something. Also what is in the areas we can't access in the bunker and around whitesprings.
---
The other TNT domes, i hope they do more with them other than special paint jobs, but just more with the domes in general. They really have a lot to work with just based off of what is currently in game.
---
Want to sell your Crushing blow M79?
---
I regularly clear out the clubhouse next to the tennis courts at the Whitesprings, and there's usually at least a couple started legendary ghouls in there. Respawn rate is decent too, so unless people are farming it, clearing the rest of the complex and selling your loot is usually enough time.
---
The hitch is that it's regularly farmed, and there may be some jackwagon who built a cheap missile turret camp in the back.
---
Lmao... seriously.
---
Oh wow i never thought of that i will remember that form now on cheers for the information 
---
When you die, try to avoid picking up ANY junk from the world or things you kill, when you die again the other bag will disappear.
---
I thought you can scrap most anything, except legendary.
---
Regardless, i wonder even with renaming, folks will still accidentally scrap their items.
---
Do you live in a recreational state? Or work in the weed industry? It's not that bad. About as much regulation as it would take to open a brewery or something like that. 
---
You know some people will even defend games like "Ride to Hell: Retribution", looks like you are one of them.
---
If you want to believe the same guy who said fallout 76 is gonna look awesome and not have bugs to also say fallout 76 sold well :D 
---
Well you cannot fix stupid, so there you go :D 
---
The logistics would be a nightmare.    You‚Äôre either bringing them to your C.A.M.P. To scan their hand to enter them into your system,  or you‚Äôre lifting their fingerprints as they sleep which gets really awkward.
---
Congrats. You're a weeb now. :D
---
That‚Äôs how it works honestly and yeah I doubt it‚Äôll stop people unless they have their eyes peeled or on the lookout for something like [daisycutter] or something at the bottom of their inventory
---
Last night I went to an un-nuked Whitesprings and every ghoul was glowing ones. Once I got to the golf course, it was full of robots. After I was done at the golf course, all the glowing ones respawned.l and I was the only one in the area. They ended up respawning 4 times. It was very strange.
---
that, and also the flamer plan for it :/
---
This has happened to me a few times.
---
Why are you here?  Honestly.  You are like the guy at the party who butts into a conversation to tell people why they are stupid, then huffs off because they don't tell him how amazing he is for doing that.
---
Yesterday on Xbox a level 50 plus helped my level 30 with a 2 star Legendary Mole miner gauntlet with about 7 or 8 plans (7 I did not haveüòä) and a chameleon armour piece and also  -15 piece of armour against ghouls very nice of him, in exchange he only needed some junk to craft some stuff, I was very greatful to himüòä
---
Very nice! That living room looks downright cozy.
---
I do this with 2 ps4s it worksssss. 
---
it could be a perk that's given to you to keep forever and the company who we will end up battling in (has shown in the trailer) are known for messing with genietics so my guess is we find a cage of dogs they never mutated before the bombs fell
---
&gt;Just requires a lot of acid farming
---
Preach it brother
---
What are those colored dots!?!?
---
Bamboozle?
---
Yes. The lever is worth more than the armor. 1* unyielding is common.
---
nothing you will does, I was attacked by a scorched with a pitch fork and he dropped a pipe revolver
---
It's legitimately free, though.
---
Is it still 1st April ?
---
Possible, i have learned a few mods already from finding random parts but not much. I think the percentage chance is low
---
You have to be in the event and get a few hits in on her to get something sadly
---
I would love some faction themed stuff for the camp
---
I don't think so. I did many runs of WS the past 2 days and many times, there were no legendary enemies spawning, just regular mobs (yes, I check the diseased ones as they may be secret legendaries; not even those). My grind is now shifting towards Watoga and Harper's Ferry as in the past month, Whitesprings was desolate of 2-3\* enemies/drops.
---
I haven't had much difficulty keeping my T-51 repaired between fix it good and power patcher, but I suppose results may vary.
---
Sounds good. Thank you. I switched over to explosives and assault rifles and managed to run out of adhesive repairing the damn things.
---
Need to find a reliable, low maintenance weapon. 
---
That would be hilarious üòÇ
---
Yes. You wanna buy?
---
My point exactly.  Why can't the other items have the same system.  Lock them down just like the Mysteries items (no upgrades, unique system IDs) and then make it so that they can be leveled via crafting bench.
---
The reason they aren't done that way, I would assume (no direct knowledge, just some good evidence), is that these are in the code merely legendary versions of specific items.  Meaning that they are upgradeable, have a Base Id matching a standard craftable/dropped weapon, have upgrade trees, etc etc and so on.  Because of that, they dont want to give you the ability to up-level them, since there's no unique identifier in the system with which to mark them for the crafting system to use (pretty sure ingredients function off of base id....which is also probably why you can't sub boiled water for purified in any recipe ever)
---
Melee is now my main, no ammo is really nice, with shotguns as a fall back and sneak rifle as secondary build, lots of fun üòé
---
Arktos Pharma doesn't really have a clear connection to the Sheepsquatch from what I could tell, and the area in the trailer is just a former Arktos lab that acts like a dungeon.
---
I don't doubt we'll see dogs as companions at some point, but it'll probably be in the summer or fall. 
---
It's good to test before you waste screws, springs, ect.
---
I‚Äôll pay 400 if it‚Äôs level 25 or below.
---
How bout a two shot explosive flamer
---
Unplug it and wait 10 seconds 
---
I bought 76 because a friend had it, so my build has charisma + team synergy. Just wish the vendors had more caps, I wouldn't be hurting for junk and ammo if I could buy it. Though I hear the next patch with help with that. 
---
Why thank you! That was the idea :) I tend to go back there at night cause it‚Äôs really pleasant with the fire and all that :)
---
Show?  Film!
---
I'm still salty about this.  I was SO excited to come back to that shooting range after getting the last item I needed. 
---
agreed, currently have 2 instigating snipers in my trade stock (one was my personal, until it was recently replaced). and 9 pieces of unyielding. 
---
THere is no recipie to "find" for the veg. starch.  
---
Just have the components on hand, and go to the cooking station.  Think its under utility.
---
IIRC, you need 2 tato, 2 mutfruit, 2 corn, 1 purified water.   Yields 1 veg. starch.
---
Once you have  veg. starch, go to ... forget whether its chem or tinker ...and scrap it.  
---
You get 4 adhesive.
---
there are number of place where you will find a power armor frame. It may or may not have the pieces attached, (l/r arm, torso, l/r leg, fusion core.)  
---
THeres 6 different kinds of armor.
---
THe frame and each component piece has its own weight (123-18#), adn each piece has a specifc level. Raider armor starts at level 15.  If you are not yet the level of the piece, you cannot attach it to the frame, you have to keep it in your inventory.
---
So if you are a L15, and run across a PA frame with a L45 chest piece, you have to take the chest piece and the frams as separate parts.  The frame will use 10# of your inventory, and the chest piece will take another 18#.
---
OTOH, if you are L15, and you find a frame with L15 raider chest piece, and you take it, then the chest piece stays attached to the frame...and has no weight.  All you gain is the 10# of the frame - the chest piece is "free"
---
Kill 25 starred legendary enemies.  It was not fun. Lol
---
I would too, looks like a great place to relax after a hard day of rebuilding the wasteland. I also dig the overhang above the entrance, nice touch!
---
I don't understand why... if you die with a bounty you lose 0 caps. It's also an awesome way to draw the server to you.
---
I lost marsupial, bird bones, eagle eyes, chameleon and speed demon while trying to get rid of empath. 
---
I keep one in my stash in case but got rid of the missiles as the take up too much weight, the Fatman is much better.
---
I‚Äôll sell you them for 250. 
---
I‚Äôm now at max caps and drowning in junk, from melee I just keep increasing shells, my consumables are the 5.56 for my sniper handmade, with health-factor and carnivore Iva all the food and health I could want. This just happened once reaching 60 + level. But I am only PVE so that is probably why.
---
Or accidentally selling the legendary variants...
---
The entire atom store is a joke. It‚Äôs a Fallout game, why pay micro transactions to wear a fucking golf tee? Or a ‚Äòclean‚Äô couch you can just sit and stare at nothing on. Bethesda needs to revamp this entire shit because I couldn‚Äôt take it seriously from day 1. 
---
May not work, but ive tricked other launchers this way.  
---
Move/rename installed folder.
---
Start fresh install to desired directory. Let it load up a few % into the install. Cancel installer. Close launcher.  
---
Move complete install files to target directory. Reload launcher.
---
Profit?
---
Go buy a lottery ticket nowüòä
---
Imo flamer's ammo should be like fusion core for gatling laser or plasma core for gatling plasma. Let's say the new flamer's ammo is called flamer gas tank; each of this gas tank has 1000 fuel. And each gas tank (1000 fuel) should last for 3-4 min of continuous flame throwering.
---
You can jump into the Oval Office in the comms room of the bunker with marsupial. Sit at the desk, and you‚Äôre in the Presidents suite 
---
Here‚Äôs the ones I‚Äôve found so far. The one in the oven at Whitesprings with the hotdog and drink is one of my faves üòÇ[Teddy Bears](https://imgur.com/gallery/loMUDNV) 
---
I have a marsupial mutation serum. Or could offer you caps for the 5mm. Say 400?
---
You give them too much credit, I'm sure this was not in their train of thought at all, they barely had a functioning networking implementation which was revealed in the beta. But it's just speculation, just like your suggestion is pure speculation. The only truth here is that there are no where near millions of players playing. Compare it to wow, where you can't move 10 feet without seeing some one. That game has millions of players, not max 24 which are half empty all the time on each instance
---
If you dies a second time, the marker on the bag may disappear, even though the bag still exists.  Additionally, it may not be in the exact place of death - You'll have to go back and do a grid search (PITA if yuo are in a grassy area - the bag blends in).
---
  Once I died in the middle of a roadway.  Found the bag inside the closest building.   
---
And, infuriatingly, sometimes (but not often), the game just eats it.
---
I just want an actual stove...
---
Thank you! I was contemplating a balcony as well but I like it as it is for now :)
---
&gt;you essentially have to make a build around glitching it into approximating the damage it was was intended to do to begin with 
---
what do those words mean?  how does one "glitch it into approximating the damage it was intended to \[deal\]"?  a item can't "approximate damage"...  you're using the word as a verb here, but only people can approximate as a verb.  
---
I don't believe this is a bug. It's working as intended.
---
What make you think it wasn't the case? Is it level related, or becaude i had not done enough with the main story?
---
Is that the ign for it?  If I happen to have it in my stash I‚Äôll sell cheap.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty rare item, if you have one that you‚Äôre willing to buy for we can sort out a price :) I‚Äôd really appreciate it :)
---
Look for the campfire icon next to their name in friends list. Campfire means survival mode. Dont go.
---
Non-lego, forest/urban scout.  I‚Äôm at around 400 ballistic with full set.
---
? If you hit the enemy, you get experience and can loot it no matter who finishes it off. I suspect you got the xp but just didn‚Äôt see it onscreen. 
---
It‚Äôs common for everyone to tag an enemy (hit it once) and then a high power player finishes it off. 
---
Let me tell you how enthusiastic I am to answer your question. I'll grab my Harbrace and get back to you. Please feel free to hold indefinitely.
---
I got attacked by a scorched with a sickle yesterday and it gave me an axe. Dont use either so im not complaining. 
---
V fast melee weapons are all so underpowered that it's sad. Drills, chainsaws, rippers, buzzblades all do next to nothing the farther you get into the game.
---
When will they fix the servers for the people who are temp banned
---
what are you shooting? sumerset has higher damage/shot to start with and ignores 50% armor. where the pipe gun if not AA gets its already weaker damage reduced more by the armor than the sumerset will
---
its not just mutants.  I've noticed in on (at least) scorched, too.  
---
Noticed it after the last patch, (although it may have been happening before then, just didn't notice it.)
---
Oh, don't get me wrong, I'd love to see all of them get a huge overhaul.
---
I like it, adds new content regularly and you can get up to 300 a week
---
PS4 shows player crouched in front of the locked item.  
---
Heck yeah! I have suppressors on all my guns. 
---
You are right about most of these but I disagree with the aid. Seeing as how I've played other games and am firmiliar with dropping stuff on death that I was carrying, I grab 5 stimpacks, 5 dog food, radaway, wine. Just carry what you'll need while you're out and refresh when you get back. Carry 5 stims... You'll drop 1-3 on death. Carry 60 you might drop 30 of them... You can only have 1 active at a time, there's no need at all to carry more than 10 of any aid on you. The rest should be in your stash. Don't carry what you can't afford to lose. 
---
This only works if your friends with the person your dealing with but im just thinking i will not trust anyone that will not come to me if im the one selling 
---
close / mid range the damage is comparable.  
---
long rage=&gt; only somerset special does damage
---
Despite strongly disagreeing on reading being boring, your other points are solid and the mobile app in particular would be fantastic. I also agree with plainly stating that the SOCIAL options in the Beth launcher and game are archaic by any standards and would be simple to improve with code since it wouldnt impact any balance in game. Have my upvote.
---
Just being in the event will net you a plan some stimpacks flux and other stuff. Hitting a sb or sbq once will let you loot the body. We bring a friends level 15 son in on the scorched earth event let him shoot her a few times or until hes out of ammo and the tell him to go hide somewhere nearby until she is dead and he gets the drops and gets to loot her. He went from level 12 to 15 in one event but he was shooting everything her could atleast once.
---
As an added bonus... no one really goes in them to PVP so you can level pretty easily. I popped in one yesterday and there were 2 lowbies (under 20) killing ghouls so I stayed invisible, let them be and moved on. I did actually blow up a car behind them at one point hoping to freak them out but I'm not sure they noticed.
---
Are you going to name it "Reddit" when patch 8 comes out?
---
I don't know what the timescale is in Fallout 76 but I'm trying to think of something that would appeal to people who don't play everyday. Weekly is a suggestion, but in any case, I would like to see something that would keep me coming back.
---
lol
---
Losing your radar does stink
---
lol, nice comeback...  no really, is English not your native language or are you using big words to try to make you sound smarter?  because your grammar atrocious...  as I pointed out, items can't "approximate" as a verb as you used it...  I did read one of your comments to someone else that helped clear it up a bit, now I know you were trying to say you have to use exploits to increase it's damage, I'm glad you chose not to detail how to do that, but you also say "to do the damage it was intended to do", like how do you know it wasn't intended to be exactly how it is?
---
The outfit? A psycho mascot covered in blood
---
They only damage enemies when in combat. 
---
I agree on everything
---
Good guide. What level do you have to be to use Excavator PA?
---
Good, cause otherwise it would be like poking a bee hive with a stick when in Whitespring 
---
It starts from level 25, goes up to level 45(max)
---
its all RNG.
---
sometimes there will be 3 3\*s in Watoga, other times zeo legendarys.
---
sometimes west-tek &amp; harpers ferry will have 5 legendarys, most of the time all you'll get is the crown in the control room and church.
---
sometimes the Enclave dropped connection will spawn a horde wave with a 3\*, most of the time it spawns a single ghoul or liberator.
---
Pleasant valley is really only good for farming steel, lead, aluminum, fiberglass, meds and food. Pleasant valley can bee good if all 5 or 6 spawn zones spawn as super mutants, and you can trigger the two different extra encounters that spawn a spawn a legendary, or if the savage divide super mutant horde spawns there. Its pretty crazy when all of those align and you end up with 10 legendary super mutants, but that has only happened to me once.
---
Maybe you can make a pucture of the surrounding,so we can help you look
---
I didn't learn the perforating magazine until about 10 hours ago. I swapped to it the second I learned it. Damage output is up, but I liked how an 85 round magazine offered ridiculous amounts of covering fire.
---
This is my frustration! I wanted survival to be players going about like normal just with more realistic and intense player encounters, not a game of cat and dog! üôà
---
Platform difference. We can only join if they're a friend on PC.
---
Sounds about right. I vendor 1* unyielding.
---
Was a result of a recent update/patch... no doubt they will fix it soon and something else will break.
---
So it makes sense that my friend request remained unanswered. My timezone GMT+3. Guess yours is somewhere in GMT‚Äùminus‚Äù?
---
Just realised what ign meant lul, yeah its called the Hunter's Long coat, based off Old Longfellows Longshoreman coat from Fo4 I believe 
---
I have a friend who bought the game about two weeks ago.  I've lost count of how many times I've said "if it's under 'ammo' and you dont use it just drop it, it's dead weight"
---
Can I sell it? Can I break it down? Wont other players want it? No no no
---
Honestly, the most enjoyable portions of Fallout 76 for me were like the first 20 levels because there was a survival component. Starting a new character and going through the same quests again just wouldn't be enjoyable because the quests weren't very good to begin with.
---
Ok cool we can join any invite if people know our GT on Xbox 
---
I'm not mad, and I agreed with your original point. Level 15 twinks shouldn't be the meta for survival. Besides, I'm pretty sure the whole idea of reddit is wasting time when you're sitting around waiting for other shit.
---
How/where do I get mods for scout armor? 
---
Are all the serum recipes similar in mat quantities?
---
Yeah I believe Central US would be GMT -5
---
Is this a Gatling laxer, I‚Äôll pay a thousand caps if it is.
---
Amazing
---
why would what amounts to sharing items with a friend result in a ban?  It's not like the stuff is easy to access.  Unless we're talking duel boxing.
---
So.. you're saying that limited time sales encourage players to buy atoms and keep them playing? Something tells me it's never gonna be removed
---
This whole thing made me die. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
"Howdy there partner"

I‚Äôm like 66....  and I play a lot!

Which ever you‚Äôd prefer I‚Äôll take either. Are you online now? My GT: TSDante40k
---
I wish there was a stabilized arms mod (As in the modifier for armor arms, not the perk card) for Power Armor or really any type of non-melee mod for arms on power armor. 
---
I kind of want to kill myself from how bad it is.

I'm working bud. I'll be online in approx 7 hours. 
---
\&gt;reliable low maint weapon
---
Death tambo, fireaxe, deathclaw gauntlet, cultists dagger....
---
All do good damage and have low repair costs.
---
My goto has been a L15 vampire machete.  incisor ans speed perks...It'll take out just about anything you'll run across on the left side of the map, and can hold its own againts small groups of almost anything.  
---
Its random but you are probably on the shitty side of the distribution. :/
---
Not everyone has friends to team with, or some people just like to go it alone. 
---
It all RNG. Think I got like 3 cranberry moonshine recipes
---
LMAO...that's a new one on me.
---
Course I've never said "kill myself" on reddit before I guess.  Never seen this before and for it to show up on here of all places...
---
good bot.
---
Sorry, but I don‚Äôt see the feature to move around my points. I have 18 currently to spend. Not sure which build to choose yet. My points so far are: 
---
S: 14 
---
P: 6 
---
E: 4 
---
C: 7 
---
I: 11 
---
A: 9 
---
L: 1 
---
I don‚Äôt see any button that let‚Äôs me move around points. Do you know any Youtube vids that might show this? 
---
Its a glitch since patch 7. They are aware of it and working on a fix. It doesn't work on player to player trades either. 
---
I don‚Äôt complain when I die because I‚Äôm not a crybaby whenever it comes to PvP
---
Still some, but they have a little less sting, which is nice
---
Interesting. Thank you! 
---
Do you know the process? It's super easy.
---
Cryolater is okay to craft. I think that's balanced enough with Ammosmith you can get 27 cells and with super duper you can double that to 54. I say that as a cryolater main. I use the crystallizing barrel to generate individual shots. Reload time is hell though. 
---
Flamers? Good lord on high. even with ammo smith and getting Super duper you can craft a MAXIMUM of 18 fuel. That'll last for half a level 50 super mutant with a lvl flamer fully moddded. I'd even be cool with a base craft of 50 fuel because that's what normally spawns in safes 
---
/u/ladydevann
---
I have that one and know a guy that can probably do it for you for a small fee. 
---
As long as people are playing that game they've said they'll keep making content. In the future there's gonna be private servers and modding tools as well.
---
[Link](https://youtu.be/tkgl6CKWXWM) they talk about legendary vendors at 6 min
---
Fucking I already left my house! I hope I get home before it ends.
---
If it is the worst and looks the worst why exactly do i definitely want it? 
---
Text chat on PS4 is my most wanted addition. I have major issues with social anxiety so its hard for me to talk to people with voice chat but I'm usually ok with typing. ESO didn't have text chat for the longest time and I just never socialized and only played solo, now that they have text chat I can play it somewhat normally and do all the group content I want to. So until FO76 adds text chat, if they do at all, I'll be a lone wanderer declining all group and trade requests just exploring the wastes alone hoping for robot or animal companions in the future.
---
Level 45. I paid 10k
---
Fallout 5 should be single player at all cost and co-op should be optional that's how you test the waters when your trying to try out a new thing like multiplayer
---
You couldn't pay me to give up my 117 spices üòÇüòÇ I need those for spicing.
---
Yes. It's the best way to remove rads without Starched Genes. 
---
thank you
---
They aren't meant for everyone. If you dont have the time to grind, you don't get the reward for it. You still aren't punished either.
---
you'd think we'd be able to get a few caps at a vendor  for a small nuclear bomb wouldn't you? :)
---
Is it empty?   Details?
---
They can spawn inside.
---
and can I have the source please?
---
Thank You I fairly new to reddit to be honest 
---
You have to study the spawn points in the area you build your camp and make sure your house isn't on top of one.
---
I hear you, and in about the same spot (job and kids), but I don't have a problem with time-limited challenges for the hard-core players with fewer real-world obligations, as long as the rest of us aren't missing out on valuable content. 
---
No more than 50 of any junk, unless its often used. (Lead, steel, plastic, springs, geara, adhesive, acid for me)
---
Those were also great additions, I enjoyed stumbling upon a legendary charred ghoul and running for the hills
---
Scrapping doesn't activate the animation for a work bench though? The craft button you mean?
---
Get a dense torso mod for your chest armor. Explosive rounds don't really do much after that. Top it off with 2 or 3 ranks of fireproof if you want total protection.
---
Maybe think about buying an explosive weapon of your own. Not a TSE. bloody explosive or instigating explosive or anti armor explosive or furious explosive. Those are the high powered explody guns now.
---
Yes but you can farm the copper whilst afk 
---
Heres my advice: book time to play with him. Do some of the events like fertile soil together. Dont dump too much gear on them; but reserve some ammo to give to them when they start running low, and offer up the low level legendaries you get when playing with them. That way they still feel rewarded if you give them one that drops for you while you're working together. Instead of just taking a hand-out.
---
You should leave a propaganda flyer, a steel scrap and 3 fusion cells. So it looks like a Liberator invade to deliver Stalin's magic of Communism.
---
No need for mutation if you can't keep them. Without the Perk Card a simple Ghoul hit can Mutate you and destroy your whole Build. Pretty much a waste of time collecting Nuka Grape or Milk to get rid of RADS
---
I'd buy it for 100. 
---
I have a picture of me and a friend in there. If you watch closely, it moves -shudders-
---
I agree completely. That would give valuable feedback to players on progression, but it may be tricky to get the user interface right if there's 10 mods, but only 8 are available from scrapping and the other 2 have to be purchased as plans. 
---
You can get a mole miner outfit??
---
PA is a great midgame bridge to finding decent legendary gear.
---
My current build takes something over 1million base resist to match up with. % reduction is far better than base resisylt.
---
another thing I noticed though. "section 2 2.1 can'y have more than one player listening to a song at once." that implies that only one person could be on the radio ~~so unless this is fake~~ they're violating contract laws or whatever you call them.
---
That's good advice, I think I'll avoid crafting gear for him, pipe pistol should be enough at early game.
---
No, it‚Äôs like a cartoony thing
---
I wish it was that
---
Deep pocketed heavy leather armor, sheilded vault 76 jumpsuit, a machete with sacrificial blade, a BOS recon sniper, and a decked out 10mm with a nice amount of ammo and some health.  This is my pack that i gift new players and they seem super excited when they get it. 
---
*Bwuuu duuuuuuuh*
---
vault tek administration in a hidden vault. npc's, vendors, teaming up with some hidden responders, that would be nice. if Elder Scrolls online can do Multiplayer MMORPG with NPC's  why can't FO76 ????
---
The end game is the worst part of this game and the opening hours are the only well balanced and content filled part. I simply can not understand why people think it is helpful to twink people through the best part of the game to get to the worst part. Like congratulations, you saved him from even having the single hour where the survival mechanics matter so he can rush right to the point it's a stupid hassle. 
---
Locked behind a tough lock: check.
---
Cool skin with a lot of detail: check.
---
Fancy unique name: check.
---
:"(
---
Yep empty and even with armor on it the damage and energy resist is 58 lower than normal, it only started after I had a guy mod a pair of shocks on each leg. 
---
What we need is a quest system where we can design our own quests for the others to do (for a reward). That way we could help the newbies learn the game via some simple tasks and reward them with the stuff they will most likely need.
---
Maybe even do it via Responders Terminal or something.
---
The fact that we can‚Äôt scrap ammo annoys me. 
---
May I  use this as my computer background?
---
Just making a point of how many up tight dicks are out there that think low levels are just scrubs. And how a pos rifle could change someone‚Äôs gameplay truly. I don‚Äôt think anyone really remembers what it‚Äôs like starting from scratch once your at level 80+ is all. I‚Äôm sure most people‚Äôs alts are already set up with gear but regular players aren‚Äôt. Drop somebody a gun or something and not every low level is a fucking noob but the gesture could go a long way. 
---
The people who begged for survival but then realized how much they suck at it use it to boost their ego after they get their butts whooped. I had two come to take my workshop, I left. Told them I was done anyway, they could have it. They left it in my name and just killed me. Over. And over. And over. I hate PvP, mostly because it's so broken. I fought back the first time but when they have 5% health and you still can't kill them, it makes it kinda pointless.
---
I have on occasion crafted full pocketed, shadowed level 5/10 armor and then a 10mm fully modded and left the set with ammo and meds in the Flatwood Overseers chest.
---
Costs me pretty much nothing, but I know someone will find them and enjoy it. 
---
Give him a bunch of cool stuff: stealth boys, stimpacks, and some shine. brotherhood outfits, a set of low level crafted gear, a power armor frame, a brotherhood recon rifle lvl 1 craft. Then take him on the order of Mysteries questline asap and skip the other quests until max level. After that you can do event quests and dailies to gain your levels and take him to the usual legendary grind spots
---
Solid post... and all things I've experienced first hand. I've banked 75,000+ caps since it started and at this point, it's all my friends and I do. Some comments...  
---
1 - They could allow you to fast travel to points you discover in that session. You leave servers and you lose all of them again. Varying the spawn location would definitely help but being able to VATS them before they spawn
---
2 - I worry about changing this because it's the only thing that keeps the stealth boy spammers from carrying 50 at a time. 
---
3 - I would make is so foundation pieces can be destroyed in Survival. I found 2 guys last night who were #1 and #2 at Seneca and it would have been nice to nuke their camp from below. I'm fine with them hiding up there I just hate the parkour getting up there for two kills. I also had a huge bounty locked in a tunnel under the bog that was blocked off with foundations.
---
4 - I'm not sure what you can do about this other than don't go inside. The last time I went into a zone I dropped mines at the door and caught someone while I was doing uranium fever. It only took out 1 of the 4 so the rest got me but that was my fault for going inside in the first place.
---
np.
---
BTW, the death tambos are L25 and L35.  
---
THe L25 was dropped by a L6 scorched during path of the wind quest, the L35 I found on the ground in an abandoned camp between the forset and divide.  It does 110 dmg.
---
Fireaxe does 114, but is slow
---
The deathclaw gauntlet does 144.
---
THe cultist dagger does 90, but it is fast.
---
L15 vamp. machete does 50, but provides heath regen.  
---
First one I had was given to me by a high level, the 2nd I picked up in the golf clubhouse at whitesprings.
---
Yes please. And attach a scanner on both sides too.
---
It's 1st shot wins, but bloodied isn't necessary to one shot players or put them down in a second.
---
Testing reveals that high damage to players is cut down to a percentage of health.
---
Bloodied is not good for players, but it's quite useful on monsters.
---
Is it cool we do the trade tonight bud? 
---
I heard Todd say they intentionally made survival as broken as possible so that people would exploit every flaw they could and then Bethesda could swoop in and fix it all at once. Atleast that's what he said at PAX.
---
&gt; The best way to save your fav gear is to buy skins for it
---
Nice try, Bethesda
---
I am not high level enough to give him Brotherhood stuffs, maybe I'll just give him some stimpacks, Radaways and a basic set of leather armor.
---
It's a map mod that shows you the ore locations of all the ores and vendors.
---
No use on my character But I‚Äôll never play through again. My other characters will be mules. 
---
There is a simple solution to that: Just as locked doors can be opened by team members, their "hand" could work on the scanner too.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è damn
---
Haha thanks! I've got a few spares in my stash if you want
---
You dont need acid to craft cyro cells, why does everyone keep saying that...thats for fuel, not cyro
---
Makeshift warrior does not increase the damage, weapon artisan does.
---
Also wanting to make sure that you knew I meant this as good advice for you, too
---
lol instant karma is beautiful 
---
Speaking of daisy cutter.. I have that is it worth keeping? Heavy AF.
---
Iirc there's a terminal in the Enclave Bunker that explains their fate. But the tl;dr.
---
The scorched plague made its way into the bunker, either intentionally by Modus to test it or by accident. Either way Modus studied the infected until they became 'unruly' and he had the robots cleanse them. Hence the damage he mentions and the state of damage within the bunker itself. 
---
Thanks a lot for the advices!
---
There is an immortal bug. I fought two people in power armor that could not be killed. I thought the issue was fixed already but apparently I'm wrong. I can kill anyone with whatever perks they want turned on in less than one magazine in VATS. I pumped hundreds of rounds into these two inside VATS and out and they never took damage. I had 3 friends with me that all PVP full time with me and we ended up bailing because we couldn't kill them. Interestingly they had 2 level 200+ friends in Sent/Ass that were easy to kill.
---
I had made one and accidently lost it, no idea where it went. 
---
Cool. Must have missed that somehow, thanks
---
It‚Äôs lore breaking for that one guy who cares about lore...
---
Welch station has generator plans cheap.
---
I'll never wear it but I'll dang sure take it if it's free.
---
My favorite activity is playing Santa, if someone is at one spot for too long I know they're at their camp so I throw on my Santa PA and throw down whatever legendaries aren't selling in the shop haha
---
Bloodied is WAY better. Two shot damage was dropped a ton. Down to 25%. Most people include two shot weapons in the "vendor trash" category now. I still have my two shot dragon, but mostly for the boom that it makes when I shoot it.
---
Yeah, not to mention calling people with entirely legitimate criticism ‚Äúhaters‚Äù is immature and inaccurate. The game had a ton to criticize at first, even beyond the ‚Äúnot what I expected or wanted‚Äù crowd, whose opinions were also legitimate. 
---
No one was trying to make the game fail. And to Bethesda‚Äôs credit they have started to turn things around, even though the rollout of this game has tarnished their image for a long time. Was the negative media overblown? Sure, but I can‚Äôt say it was entirely undeserved. 
---
I actually have that !! 
---
Boxer briefanor whitey tighteys?
---
10k? Yikes.
---
it's 1400... not 1200
---
Eh. Cocaine has such a bad come down.
---
I waited until L45 to build excavator.  Wanted the extra DR, etc, etc.
---
I have three different Grog axes they are all sleeping deep in the stash. Until they can fix it I‚Äôll keep using my WV Fire axe. 
---
I might had taken me about 16 hrs or so of gameplay all I did was take over workshop , join events like crazy all the ones I know spawn legendaries on the open ( not indoors uranium fever) and rinse and repeat running like crazy killing myself before hitting the leaderboard , hitting the leaderboard and having a guy sneaking on me , teaming up with randoms just to protected somewhat better 20 behind you then 23.
---
But yeah concur they‚Äôre pretty tough 
---
Is this a joke lol? I thought it only weighed 6pounds or something because of the reduced weight legendary affect it comes with..? But to answer your question it‚Äôs worth keeping up until you get another Fatman with 2* or 3* /w reduced weight legendary affect.. if it‚Äôs honestly heavy AF you could always consider selling it, I‚Äôve seen them go for as high as 1.5k cap max level and what not
---
My Camp is kind of close to Whitesprings (north, up in the mountains). I keep a stash box and all the workbenches in front so anyone can use them. I was over encumbered and was scrapping the extra armor pieces I had picked up. Theres been several times I was using a workbench and got killed in my Camp so I was trying to hurry scrapping in case anyone showed up to fight. Does that make sense? 
---
Hardest part to get one is to find an assaultron to get its circuit board. Personally I prefer the Sentry Bot helmet, combined with marine armor and wetsuit, but nonetheless the assaultron helm does look badass
---
Bump.
---
Amazing thing about pure survival.. a pecking order becomes established by the folks who know their stuff vs, the kids who think they know their stuff.
---
Do what I did and open a shop. Design your camp like an actual store and trade items for next to nothing, or just give them away. Build it near the overseers camp so you‚Äôre sure to keep getting new players stopping by, or near whitespring to get mid/high level players the things they need. 
---
My favorite 76 experience so far was setting up camp near Helvetia during the Fasnacht parade. Had so many visitors looking for specific plans I had duplicates of. Even selling everything at 50 caps, I made 4K caps one day and got traded tons of rare plans I wanted. 
---
If not legendary scrap it , if not your level scrap it , you‚Äôll find something better.
---
Never have any bulk item nor spoiling items on stash 
---
Never carry over 60 of anything other then for Ammo crafting ( if you do so )
---
And get rid of most of the aid that keep only enough for use for the next 2 hours.
---
In case needed more go back to base and replenish 
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs ok, but yeah I was SO relieved only the chassis got scrapped and not my PA pieces. 
---
They only removed the stacks because their servers weren't tracking item IDs, probably because there aren't any unique ones. There was no way for them to tell what was really duped or not, so they just went with the only distinction they had, which was stacked weapons.
---
Well I have that covered with the whole 'variation' thing, doesn't have to be called his outfit or have augmentation on it. 
---
Wow, thanks for the heads up. 
---
I‚Äôve kept it because I‚Äôd heard conflicting comments about explosive nerf.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs on my stash and haven‚Äôt used it.
---
Wondering if I should sell it via marketplace 
---
now to move enough stuff off of mules that I can have an actual alt instead if 9 mules...
---
Someone has left that plan in the cache. It won‚Äôt be there for every new character. 
---
Some prebuilt CAMP blueprints would actually be really cool. They'd have to be fairly basic to account for people not having plans for specific things within them, so they'd have to be just structure. Maybe you could only buy them if you had learned the plans for that type of wall.
---
You get an instigating 40mm launcher after all this trouble, unless you sport an explosive build, is it worth it? 
---
üôÑ
---
But finding it? That's not the hard part.
---
I mean it says it when hovering over the arms so unless it's bugged it should work.
---
Hmm you‚Äôre right, I totally forgot about the nerf, but I‚Äôm sure you could get a grand minimum for it, I‚Äôve seen recent offers for buying it at that price
---
All containers on the world are accesible by players on server wide as long as server is online , somebody was kind enough to put their extras there for anybody to take 
---
Molotov bow
---
Poison cloud bow
---
All bombs attachable mods that cuz bombs to explode immediately on bow impact. 
---
I've been getting legendary gear when completeing events lately
---
I mean, in all honesty I think in adventure mod taking a workshop should just make it a functional place. The defend events show on the map for everyone, so it should just make it an accessible resource. No locks on containers, etc. Same way turning on the power plants helps everyone with a power box close by. Then we could finally take away the Tryhards last way of forcing passives into PvP.
---
upvoted soley for the auto mod comment
---
&gt;Then your words are unrelated to your game and your complains are idiotic. 
---
I never complained about anything.   You keep responding to things that I never said and yet you are calling me idiotic?   
---
Okay then. 
---
Bye.
---
This isn‚Äôt fortnite 
---
You know what I mean, it would be better if they just added less of them but kept them there forever
---
And that was often an aggravating feature of wow, swtor, and eos.  Insanely crowded common areas... which would not at all match the lone wanderer aesthetic.  I like the density, especially when events like nukes, uranium fever, and fasnacht bring us together.
---
Speaking of which... again, why are you here?  This thread does not show up in popular, so you are hanging out here months after you quit the game to tell people that they are having fun that they are stupid?  Did you ever leave elementary school, or..?
---
It is a legit question, because if that is who and what you are, your opinion holds weight because..?
---
I'm going to try and use mostly sturdy but I'm worried some legendary will drop that will temp me to the dark side.
---
I picked a supressed 45 machine gun off a dead critter in the forest.
---
I think you need a gunsmith perk to add a silencer as a mod.
---
Powerfist bloodied. Same damage as DCG with extra armor pierce.
---
Solution to that is have them all 
---
Why was it his business what you do? Whitesprings is one of the best places to get plastic.
---
If you're on PC I'll trade you the white russian recipe for one of your sunrise recipes.
---
Someone slipped you a sausage?
---
Tbh, I‚Äôd really prefer the mats or the plans for excavator shocks to increase carry weight.
---
Who knows how messed up their development process is. Removing drills should be a trivial change (they added hunting rifles after all). Maybe they are not allowed to chance stuff too much because of the engine is in use by Fo4, ES6 and Starfield.
---
Also 3\* used to guarantee drop 3\* before December. It makes no sense and just annoys one. If they wanted reduced 3\* drops, why not reduce the chance for a 3\* enemy spawn?
---
I have had the workshops used as a way to initiate pvp. They don't even take it all the way, they just start the process to initiate hostility then harass me till I leave server.
---
I play on PS4. How do you do that? 
---
&gt; The game was a hot fucking mess when it released. The youtubers realized real quick that hate got them views and everybody cashed in on that big time. 
---
I was watching some youtuber yesterday, can't remember his name because I was down a rabbit hole, but he outright said that Fallout 76's botched launch made him a ton of money.  I can't even be mad at him.  People love to shit on things they don't like, and watch other people do the same. 
---
They are super rare
---
+1 I use the Lever Action paint for this reason. That and it looks pretty cool. I do wish they had more skins available and dropped the price just a tad, but maybe one day soon. On the new skins at least lol. 
---
What‚Äôs your platform anyways?
---
I‚Äôm on pc..
---
It‚Äôs a corpse 
---
You've got no assurances this game sold well other than Bethesda telling you it did. They haven't released any player numbers, no sales numbers everything is purposely made ambiguous because the truth would mean less posts like this one.
---
What lvl Lord? I may have a friend who needs one.
---
Dunno this reminds me of the Fallout 2 Enclave Encounter :D 
---
 [http://archive.nma-fallout.com/fallout2/maps/random/frank.gif](http://archive.nma-fallout.com/fallout2/maps/random/frank.gif) 
---
I played it enough to go, yep, mmo with random people,all running up to quest giver same time I am which just makes it feel like a game with excuses to make you go do stuff to get stuff rather than a story. There‚Äôs too many people running around in an mmo who are mostly just doing things to level up and not acting like characters to ever get immersed, they keep breaking my immersion. And yes, I find fallout a lot more immersive when I don‚Äôt see a ton of other people doing the same quest as me constantly. Yes I do sometimes but It‚Äôs not constant and with the exception of a few robots they‚Äôre not all going up to one npc talking to them (and really biv is the only one popular enough I‚Äôve had that experience of me and some one else going up to him at the same time). And the story for fallout 76 is actually decent. It‚Äôs Bethesda doing story telling the way they do best, with little bits and pieces to give you the full story. And all those bits do come together to paint a bigger picture. 
---
I love that our photos become our loading screen
---
I‚Äôll watch my back haha 
---
I did this challenge all weekend and finally finished it last night. Finding starred legendary enemies sucks. I bet i killed 50 or more but the game only counts half of them. Good luck!
---
Beth, please add a mole miner outfit to the atomic shop, please thanks lol
---
Idk why your getting downvotes,, the logic here is dumb. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough time to complete the challenge plz nurf‚Äù 
---
Was the challenge difficult, yes. Was is doable yes. 
---
Same her for the last couple of weeks.
---
PS4 - mic works, other people can hear me, I see their speaker icon animate, but I can't hear them. 
---
Yes, all in the same mode.
---
Had to goto party chat to talk.
---
I don't have caps in PvP but that's because I'm not dumb and started a new character so I didn't lose any until they fix the bugs
---
Sounds like u die a lot m8 
---
I recently posted where I have a powerfist and with the perks I have plus food buffs I can deal 2500-3000 damage on my first punch, and I hit a player who took zero damage. Personally I think if they're going to have armor that can do this, then there's no point in PVP
---
I'd suggest unpainting it for now, unless you want to lose said PA when they fix this bug. 
---
'Our game sold well but we won't tell you how many bought it or are playing it, thats our little secret'
---
They won't tell you because its nothing to brag about. WoW releases its player and sub numbers because millions are always a bragging right.
---
Ah, no way I could with my setup except for maybe if I see them before they sense me. For me they are the most unfun, cheap feeling npc. I liked them before they added burrowing but the fact that burrowing means even caution means they are going to instantly teleport to me and they are constantly teleporting to move just makes them rage quittingly frustrating. Especially when they chase me across the map cause I can‚Äôt even run away.  
---
I keep outfits to sell instead of caps.  My caps immediately go to ammo or junk I can't find enough of.
---
Good call i will reach out to my buddies to grab spare parts they find and i will drug myself up in hopes of learning something. 
---
So you never made it out of the tutorial. We could tell.
---
&gt; And the story for fallout 76 is actually decent. It‚Äôs Bethesda doing story telling the way they do best,
---
Thanks for the laugh. Get back at me when 76 has 1700+ voiced quests and more than a Mr. Handy npc.
---
They never release numbers for their games. Many games companies do that
---
darn, that‚Äôs rough the market is a lot harsher off the consoles I find.. you could still try to sell it for offers, you could also try looking through your inventory for unneeded items and do a bulk-sale, and if worst comes to it grind out common material and sell those in bulk on the market, there‚Äôs things you would think nobody would buy but you would be surprised on the amount of people out there willing to trade for things you seemly think of as having little to no value, especially the cap offers for common mats
---
You will be flagged as "Wanted"
---
Is the same for me and my friends :
---
Unkillable people
---
Shotguns that kill you from 200 meters which concentrated fire
---
yeah it's pretty annoying... hope they fix it soon
---
You paid 10k an now want to sell it? 
---
Yeah I usually leave my duplicates in the register at White springs for others
---
I don't mind fair play, but certain build are broken when you stack certain effects. There's a reason people will pay 15k+ for assassin's sentinel armor.  100%-40%=60% and 60%-(60%√ó75%)= 15%. Add in the DR and what's the point? AP doesn't work against percentage decreases.
---
Shhhh nobody knows this secret 
---
I‚Äôm building a full store specializing in building plans and recipes. I‚Äôve made a few of these now at  populated spots like the overseers camp, Helvetia for the Fasnacht event, and now building near Whitespring. It‚Äôs been really fun messing with building a store, especially designing and improving on my vendor window design. In my latest shop I‚Äôve doubled the display items in the store itself so it looks legit like a store. 
---
[Here‚Äôs a walkthrough of my previous shop](https://youtu.be/lM5IgTxJtOk). 
---
I'd say its layered.
---
So lets say you have this particular armor.
---
IMO what happens is that from for example 100 damage, you'll drop down to 60 (-40%), and then to 15 (-75%) so something like 85% effective negation. But its only two layers and I believe there to be 5+, maybe 8? Dodgy is another layer I suppose. DR is one of them. Psycho damage reduction - yet another.
---
Thats still more complicated than my current understanding of it is so take it with grain of salt but be assured - I can still oneshot people that wear full set of such armor so its not impenetrable.
---
If I can yeah. I dont use it anymore 
---
Imagine having a two shot version of this pupper it looks like a dragon in your hands :)
---
Two words; Gamma gun
---
Sentinels does sweet FA vs rads
---
Yea removed. Existing ones still have it though but any lazer, cryo, or flamed with explosive is already worth over 10k regardless of stats and level 
---
Exactly. Now they have less people that are better than they are at PvP showing up going "Oh, so you like PvP do you?"
---
Got to be honest given the lack of real story in this game I'm kind of ok with not being cannon this is more the boys just want to have fun fallout
---
Valid point!  What they have done for adventure has helped
---
That‚Äôs crazy. If I kill someone in pvp and get 0 caps they get spawn killed over and over lol until they leave the server
---
Lmao so it was you!!
---
I‚Äôve gotten killed on 4 times on the span of whatever time I did on survival ( 20 hrs ) and always on the same way , sneaked on with melee ,  not really pvp I keep insisting guys.
---
I did the same as him I‚Äôm level 200 it‚Äôs not worth for me other then specific rewards not really there to baby sit some other players 
---
I've had them wait for me to shoot at something and then run in front of me. It's to where I can only use VATS ( i am a vats build, but there are some downtime when Grim Reaper's Sprint doesn't proc right) if one of them is around.
---
i can finally add shopping areas to my camps. Im gonna put the vending machines behind counters like npcs
---
It only happens when your team status is bonkers i.e. you are still part of team, but there are 0 teammates in your game (i.e. crash to desktop). You fix it by leaving such team.
---
That‚Äôs funny!
---
No worries, I‚Äôve had daisy for a while now, at or around the explosive nerfs. If it‚Äôs not a huge weight footprint, I‚Äôll keep it. 
---
I‚Äôve been scrapping missile launchers and ditching missiles because of nerf. Assumed fat mans were in the same class.
---
I‚Äôll test it out to see how much fun it actually is.
---
That's very generous of you but that seems a little "take all the fun out of it" to me but I like to accomplish games by myself
---
No.  But when I took it over the core resource was working.  And the event took place while the power sources were still showing full power.  I think that if you take over a workshop and the power source is at full, it will stay that way the entire time you own it.  I noticed that with Sunshine Meadows food processor.
---
If you already have a ton of crystal then yeah sure you don't need acid; you can just craft cyro ammo with Crystal + Lead Scrap. But if you're farming via workshop or crystal veins in the cave, mine, etc. You need acid to turn "Raw Crystal" into "Crystal"
---
Uhh, fella most companies release sales numbers and Steam does a fantastic job tracking consecutive player numbers for all games in its library.
---
That's the point. They are terrible on even ground so they stay where there are people that don't really want to fight back. They are beta predators. Chickenhawks. Jackals. The wild mongrel to the mutant hound.
---
I paid them for 1000 atoms so that kinda worked, but I also have a philosophy of paying for useless visual stuff when I see updates that I enjoy, and ohboi I LOVE the survival mode.
---
Yeah, especially when the Minigun isn't aligned with its hands and it's trying to run with it.
---
It‚Äôs good to hear you‚Äôve run into some great people out there!
---
Just realized it was a Gatling lazer :( was pumped for a rifle. I‚Äôll pay 15k for it but won‚Äôt be home till after work 
---
it doesnt force me to buy it. Rather if it is limited time or not, if i like it, i buy it.
---
Well, in this game, garbage wifi works in favor of the person who has a bad connection. 
---
Perhaps they were lagging out? Zero things negate ranged damage in power armor.
---
Because if they didn't make it competitive, the CoD/fortnite crossovers who have invaded that Fallout universe wouldn't even touch it. Why would they when they can just prey on and harass people in adventure mode? More chance of winning and the rewards would have been the same.
---
I have been hoarding screws for months.
---
I have sooooooo many.
---
I am going to sell screws to become the Kingpin of the Wasteland.
---
Probably have to wait until the camera DLC item comes out soon
---
People shit on it because it‚Äôs a bethesda game. But it wasn‚Äôt what they wanted. The game is good, it just has no story. Its your typical survival game like rust without the extreme raids of other players, but they have that now.
---
And it was buggy but like I said that‚Äôs bethesda
---
What these guys said, plus @level 50 you will want 3x Super Duper in Luck
---
Absolutely!  Come on out and see what the community is offering!
---
I find it often neglected due to no fast travel point and 60 plastic in 3 min run is always welcome.
---
OMG this is the worst they never carry it right and it looks so f'n silly
---
Not every game publishers likes giving numbers on their game. If eso could get millions of sells on release why can't fo76 can?
---
Ok. What's your gt
---
Here! Here!
---
Idk how many wood legs and rolling pins I've been missing out on
---
Lawton arnold 
---
They had no problem killing others.
---
I didnt say to nerf it. But theres unlisted stipulations. How about "instructions unclear; reword instructions". 
---
Bravo: 80081355
---
If the first shot generally wins anyway, then you might as well pour everything into making that one shot the most powerful it can be.
---
I just want the named legendary, only reason im even bothering with survival tbh.
---
It should be one shot all the way around then. Not just for people with certain builds.
---
I'm a shotgun build with every damage perk, bloodied mess, and critical perks, so when someone with 5% hp can take 4 rounds to the face and then one shot me. Boo. Realism is a lie. There is only salt and hatred from what I can see lol.
---
i did. they crouch and move their hands around like they playing with someone's ass
---
I hope you‚Äôre kidding.
---
Not a bad idea I would like a I don't need that option as well 
---
Yes, that isn't a problem for people with bad connection, especially if they have melee or high fire rate guns.
---
I mean its level 1 gear so they will grow out of it eventually. Yes the gear it pretty OP for a level 1 or 2 but do you remember being a low level and how hard you had to struggle? I like people to play more and not be discouraged but early level gameplay. In return these people come back and trade with me. My favorite part of this is i have recieved 4 messages from people saying the items i gifted them have been passed on to other players to help them. Now im helping people, help other people. Its a good feeling!  
---
I wasn't suggesting an empty battle royale experience. More hardcore survival. I'm pretty sure that game isn't an rpg, survival oriented, or even appeals to the Fallout 76 audience. 
---
No probably not, i just want it because its a named Legendary.
---
The VATS used to freeze the game and you could select multiple parts of multiple targets and then watch as they all dropped dead. You could even use grenades back in FO3 and NV. Those were the days.
---
Yeah that's the part that is scaring me. When i server hop i see familiar names now. I sure hope those vaults are legendary in quality of fun. Only thing i know that will bring back all the people that quit. These little events here and there barely pass the time of any serious player.
---
Executioners is pretty amazing.
---
I mean, I can actually *see* the damage I'm doing to the Scorchbeast Queen. üòÇ
---
I farm full sentinel assassins often oneshooting them.
---
They are no match for appropriate tools.
---
OP, write to me privately and send me your current build.
---
I have been looking all over the wast lands for some screws 
---
Both were using automatic rifles and I assume were bloody builds as they were always under 50% health. I think this is just a weird bug and they decided to take advantage of it.
---
I skimmed and assumed, thanks for clarifying. My bad. Tbh no Star legendaries prob should count and it‚Äôs a bug or error that they arnt. And agreed if intentional is should clearly indicate it.
---
@Ataiel, 4 months later, can you please confirm again that you can craft them (the 3rd claw mod - not the Deathclaw Gauntlet), rather than having had a mod in your inventory? I still have not been able to find the Plan for it... Thanks.
---
useful TSE weapons go for less than half of that
---
Was pumped when i found a 3 star gram, but he was no different and just as funny. 
---
Because ESO was marginally good and the Elder Scrolls fanbase makes up a large portion of Bethesdas customers? Fallout is a drop in the ocean.
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/306130
---
Just on Steam alone ESO only tops a 31,000 player peak. If we count the people playing through another launcher / Bethesdas own chance are you'll only see a top peak out of 50-60k. Not "millions".
---
Are you paid to say the things you say?
---
That would be so cool. 
---
Whenever a mole rat destroys a generator us Keypad Door users have to delete our doors just to enter our CAMP. Which resets the Keypad Code every time. Hand scanner doors would completely solve this issue.  
---
You shouldn't be forced to log out of the game just because someone else wants to be an asshole. That's ludicrous.
---
Kinda like how soon adventure mode with be nothing more than 4 "taking their time" players spending decreasingly less time in game and only logging in to "look at the beautiful terrain" before logging off again lol.
---
Bear in mind, some of the scout armor mods are bugged, dense in partticular doesn't work at all. 
---
Not running enough 
---
There a huge potential for crossbow mods.  Upvote this for visibility to the Powers That Be that  they may hear our desires.
---
Right now, the lowly Meat Hook benefits from both Gladiator *and* Iron Fist.  As for perks, you can never go wrong with Anti-Armor.
---
I had my first spawn in at Vault 76 - it was a crazy death match!
---
Although the people who make camps by spawn points and just wait can piss off.
---
&gt;Some may call this junk.  Me, I call them treasures
---
Hey Belethor!  
---
Classic line from a classic game.
---
It could be tied into the same tag option that keeps them from being scrapped or sold too.
---
It says obo
---
Sometimes it's just that the body moves. I think there are times when the server thinks the body should be in a different place and so moves it.
---
ESO on release was buggy and broken just like fo76 but was fix through patches. And fallout is bigger than tes
---
What time you get off work?
---
If caps and fast traveling is an issue for you, do some cap runs. Even as a low-level, you can get around 800 a day (1,400 if you have all locations). That should cover fast traveling for quite a while. 
---
Thank you again, Brad. I really appreciate the help!
---
Nice yeah that's one reason I started taking pics I thought were cool, got sick of the loading 
---
&gt; And fallout is bigger than tes
---
I'll stop arguing with you here pal, no sources no discussion. Enjoy your day!
---
Best TH is bloodied faster swing speed +1 strength  super sledge 
---
Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm has some on the first floor on the shelves.  There are two boxes of them that will spawn near the tool chests.
---
Are ramps indestructible?
---
The sentry helmet looks better overall, but I like that the assaultron helmet opens and closes based on whether your weapon is drawn or not!
---
The Hills ? Golf course. Kill the mangler fish, they drop bulk adhesive.
---
I noticed the same thing, though in third person mode there is no delay...it actually looks like a quick draw artist at work.
---
I found myself using third person exploring and then drawing the weapon and switching to first person to speed it up. And yes, would be nice to skip that animation.
---
And no life saving legendary effect to counter your damage at the last second. I love my radium rifle.
---
I do but I've also killed a few them grenades sure to take it those high levels easy if you get the drop
---
Cool weapons add like 10% more damage.  I mean you can't see it in the stats, but it is there.
---
Yeah have the same issue.. no bloody tick blood tequila.. 24/25 drinks done
---
Yeah. Any foundation is.
---
Grimer used toxic (that‚Äôs u)
---
Ah, didn‚Äôt realise, thanks 
---
Would make survival even more of a cluster fuck. Because that‚Äôs why you want that. You don‚Äôt want to lose your caps in survival. 
---
I know people already trade caps to a friend to have no caps but still.
---
I hope it adds NPCs. It probably will. That doesn't automatically make it good though. 
---
I use a lot of adhesives to mod and lvl weapons. You can also create adhesive farms at your camp. You just need mutifruit, corn and tatos, to make vegetable starch at any stove or chem station.
---
Critical vats headshot using an instigating hunting rifle equipped with perforating mag. No need to sneak, the damage will be high enough.
---
This combo kills any rad-scorpion variant in one-shot.
---
Anyway, before i had the Anti-Tank perk equipped i had issues with radscorpions too, just try to get lots of anti-armor effects and you should do just fine.
---
To me it feels as if they have very low HP but lots of armor and if you don't hit them in the face you're going to have a hard time.
---
I don't feel entirely forced because I do have a few choices in how to respond, although it was really annoying as I was building camp.  Rebuilding camp is cheap so if they want to destroy it, I just let them go at it.  They want to provoke PvP but I'm not in the mood for it so I ignore it.  Luring enemies to me so they can jump in front of my attack is a cheap move and I just won't put up with it, I'm gone!  Otherwise I've started storing my junk immediately and not carrying any around with me except for fertilizer, so they only get literal crap when they kill me.  When I'm a higher level I'll fight back but I'm still kind of little and can easily get taken out.
---
Its all good. They fixed some foundation stacking glitches a few patches ago. People could make entirely inaccessible forts.
---
Has Bethesda said anything about how vending is going to work with the caps limit?
---
Let's say that my character is already at max caps, and I have a vending machine at my camp.  Someone hits my vending machines and buys 1,000 caps worth of stuff from me.  Do I *get* that 1,000 caps?  Where does it go?  
---
What about football and baseball season . It‚Äôs got be embarrassing when you try to be a smart ass but end up being a dumbass
---
So it appears.  I was running bloody and swinging often to test it and one shotting every exterior part that wasn't a floor.  My explosive shotgun was taking out interior turrets and some walls.
---
The concrete foundations and concrete ramps were taking zero damage.
---
In general I agree, but I just don't think the game is balanced well enough to make the mode much fun for me.  
---
Goddamnit ! I thought i finally found an answer out of the "Praise RNJesus"...
---
PS: data is coming, i just need to have a good amount of legendaries and to further test the idea.
---
Lol. I'm asking Bethesda to add it. The title is just a snappy title. It has nothing to do with my actual in game caps or survival mode... Such as the key ring in fallout new Vegas. It's simply makes inventory management easier.
---
I want that outfit so bad!
---
Yeah I have never run with power armor because of the high cost for maintaining and creating. I definitely want to try it out. This helps steer me in the right direction so hopefully i can not get overwhelmed and stay focused on what i want to build.
---
Server hop until you get a notification for a free re settling , don‚Äôt do it and your camp will be safely folded  same spot same everything 
---
I think it's failure wasn't not selling copies.  It failed the same way No Man's Sky failed.  Hype brought the people, people bought the game, game was a mess and they uninstalled.  Over time the game got less messy, but the damage was probably done.  
---
He‚Äôs wrong 
---
I can't wait for this to be implemented as well. Maybe I can finally find a decent weapon for my high level character instead of a lame sniper rifle I've been using since level 45 (I'm now level 108). The only issue is they're gonna have to either greatly raise, or do completely away with, the 25k cap limit or having a shop won't be worth it. Once you reach the 25k, you're done until you spend enough to make reopening your shop worth it again. Hope Bethesda knows this and takes it into consideration before going live with it.
---
I assume he's logging off / switching mode or server to get his friend to kill him away from everybody and share the bounty reward. So... it feels like you're giving him and his friend 400 caps &gt;\_&lt;
---
There are a couple aspects I really like about 76's storyline as it exists so far.
---
The first is that it embraces futility.  All these factions before you tried and failed.  Everyone is dead.  Even killing the Scorchbeast Queen doesn't solve the problem.  Unlike previous Fallouts, you aren't a god who who ultimately decides the fate of the wasteland - the best you can do is try to contain the problem.
---
The second is that Appalachia was screwed whether nuclear war happened or not.  Reckless mining, "nuclear fracking," and amoral corporations combined with an amoral government make 76's scenario about the evils of unfettered capitalism more than nuclear war, and I found that interesting.
---
Give me fuel, give me fire, give that which I desire.
---
I agree that fuel is way to hard to make/obtain in the quantities needed to make flame weapons viable. I'd love to use mine as it's the perfect weapon for dropping hordes of charging ghouls (and two players with them is an awesome sight!) but you burn through the fuel so fast it's just not worth using more than a few times.
---
I would suggest either hoarding materials and hoping it doesn‚Äôt get griefed that much or make a new character for pvp and do the vertibot thing and lvl up quickly. Or you could just bluprint everything except the foundations and store it all then just place again
---
I‚Äôm not the police, it is just annoying and I am trying to warn you. No one is stopping you from enjoying the game, we‚Äôre just saying they deserve the initial flak they received.
---
Do you remember when people asked refunds and all their Personal info including address were being sent by email to random people that could have taken advantage of that info??
---
It‚Äôs not just bugs, it‚Äôs a bigger picture.
---
No. They RNG drop what's in their loot table. It makes sense if you've ever played any game ever that RNGs loot. The weapon they're holding makes no difference.
---
As someone collecting all the plans for power armor mods to offer services as a PA crafter this has been an invaluable guide.
---
Thank you for the work you put in to this!
---
You definitely want the flamer mod. The dual bar mod looks bad with the flamer mod, and isn't as useful as the bow  bar mod.
---
Use your mic. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand why someone would give another person a gun on the condition they had to relog for the caps. üò£
---
Not sure how this will be working but i think your gona have to spend 200 caps to build a vending machine like how it worked in fallout 4 with the shops
---
Sorry servers are down due to the recent change of "unlimited stash space" overloading the servers with everyones crap. üòÇ
---
I have the flamer and the long bow. Is that the best or is the dual better than the long? 
---
An easy way to really double up on stimpacks is to buy the stimpack recipe from the med bay area of the enclave then harvest tick blood and tick blood sacks from the forest area (moonshiners shack) whilst using butchers bounty perk to really maximise the amount you get, then equip the chemist perk at a chemistry workbench to turn the tick blood into blood packs (this gives you double the return), scrap the the tick blood sacks for antiseptic. Then you can craft stimpacks using those materials and double up again. If you have the super duper perk that's great to epuip too as it gives you a chance to craft extra of everything. I do this run once or twice a week normally get around 40 stimpacks at a time by the end of it.  
---
Not gonna happen. If you want to embrace your hoarding like me make new characters to start holding stuff. 
---
Amen
---
i dunno what your brightness settings are on, but The Mire is dark as fuck at night for me. I have to turn my pipgirl light on to see directly infront of me haha.
---
Idk buy stuff and max out all your gear and bace 
---
And then you need acid to craft gunpowder for bullets, and flamer fuel it's self takes like 2 steel then 10 oil/acid for 5 (8 with ammo smith) ammo, that if your lucky and proc super duper nets you 16 ammo per craft, which is ridiculous due to how retardedly short the flamer's range is, and how much ammo it burns per second to deal damage.
---
Haha, that's exactly why I'm wearing a mixture of two. I was trying to stick to leather just for the looks of it, but didn't I get a nice, sturdy Vanguard combat armour chest drop and it ruined everything! ;D
---
I actually landed a legendary flamer in a drop at WS, and it was badass.  Problem was I churned through fuel faster than a Dodge Hellcat at a drag trip and it weighed a shit ton.  So I sold it soon after. 
---
Too bad, really.  It‚Äôs a cool weapon 
---
Sorry to disappoint you, fellas, but I don't care! 
---
In watoga, I had one explode yesterday and then another immediately after did not explode at all. 
---
I have a camp at whitesprings; on the golf course, near the river, no turrets or anything like that. Nobody ever attacked my camp, nobody tried to destroy it, and i know for sure that people were there, my doors won't close on their own, sometimes i find meat piles near my camp...
---
It's rare to have someone destroy your stuff for no reason at all. Most people playing Fallout 76 are actually nice; even those playing survival.
---
I have no locks on anything and people are welcome to use my camp. 
---
I spent about 15 hours or so on survival. Maybe that's not enough to get my camp razed to the ground by random people.
---
Free caps!  Quick, to the youtube outrage machine!
---
Oh, you mean caps you can wear.
---
Also if trading if for some reason I walked away because you wanted to by my tse or my bloodied something don‚Äôt keep chasing me or get butt sore because I just walked away ( that means not for sale )
---
It's easiest to get crystal at lucky hole mine which yields crystal ore. That's why people need acid
---
5 caps.
---
If they did this, dupers would completely destroy servers.
---
I think the Weapon and Ammo should be set to the Enemy. If i kill an enemy that‚Äôs using an Combat Rifle i should get a combat rifle and the ammo. The other stuff like Junk/Chems/Caps can be random generated. Anything else doesn‚Äôt make sense imo. 
---
Yeah I definetly forgot about plastic. I have so much glue on the other hand that it‚Äôs not even funny. And ever since I found out you can make your own from your garden, it was a wrap. 
---
5pm Eastern 
---
No problem! Always happy to help another survivor. 
---
That's the funnest stuff to do though, just get in there and wait for them to show up while you're in your underwear.
---
Yes. This is annoying. It's been happening since I started playing back in December. Doesn't make sense why that mutant I just killed dropped a pipe pistol when he was lauching missles at me. Lemme tell ya, that pipe pistol packed a lot of punch. Why don't my pipe pistols do that? :/ Or what about those shotguns that turn into pitchforks? Why do the enemies get all the neat stuff?
---
Then it's the only thing that can be used as a weapon that can't be repaired to 200%.
---
I get it, i get it. I‚Äôve heard plenty of people say they wanted it to stop stacking so I posted it. That was he smellest point I made in the whole thing, don‚Äôt hate this post just for one point you disagree with.
---
Yes sir a genuine Pit-Boy, pried mine off a deathjaw myself!
---
Tour the toxic valley. downed trees all over.
---
Or you just build a new set when you are 45?
---
I keep saying this: the first few hours of this game is the only part that has any content or interesting mechanics, It is baffling to me how many people think they are helping by twinking players up to the boring endgame by subverting all survival mechanics and handing out gear that trivializes all quest content and obsoletes quest rewards.   
---
Like congratulations you made the game way worse for someone 
---
it's a real problem. It's never repaired the grog ax to 200%
---
I do not know either, but the player who gave the gun was stupid.
---
If that is not me, I only lost one pistol and that one because of the Bethesda.
---
You utter legend! 
---
You know the person ain‚Äôt coming back for 2 radaway 
---
That sucks!  
---
Great for heavy weapons as well.
---
Update: apparently there is a back door to the mine. He was in there. 
---
Great to hear!  I don‚Äôt run into that many griefers either and I‚Äôve played since Beta
---
Oh, my bad. No yea you are right. I thought you meant a letting type thing for your caps to put into your stash. 
---
I 100% agree though. Sorry.
---
That would be sick 
---
No prob. 
---
I don‚Äôt.  The griefers are the ones who fallow and taunt and harass and are relentless.
---
A little PVP is part of the game
---
My 6-year old helps me harvest corn and razorgrain, they can't wait to actually fight something.
---
Save your Camp as a Blueprint. Be sure u saved it. It has a own Category. Delete all your Junk Walls, Turrets, Bullshit and build a new Camp fitted for survival.
---
''Negative'' Side Effect is you need to build every item new and use new stored junk for it. Would not do it if you have something with personal attachment in your champ and cant get anew.
---
Best they could do is halve the weight of all things in the stash. They aren't going to though.
---
I'm a God, how can you kill a God?
---
Because I really really like fallout 76? I'm just not 15 and delusional. 
---
That's a possibility, but either way it needs fixed. If I kill something it should fall at my feet and stay there cause that's where I killed it, or at the very least land somewhere nearby if it's flying or gets knocked back from my attack. I'm not about to search God knows where for a body that should be at my feet or close by. I've even watched them literally sink into the floor before and vanish that way. Now they just poof and gone.
---
We need it urgently! I have around 300hr on the game, from which 99% is solo gameplay. 
---
None of my real life friends play fo76 and i can't make friends inside the game because i can't talk with them. 
---
My only free time to play is when everyone is sleeping so using a Mic is a no-no.
---
It was when i was playing that 1% in a team that i've realized how the games is absolutely different when you play with other people. So without any means of real communication i never could enjoy fo76 to its full potential
---
Or make their lights flicker? 
---
Sometimes I do come up to their house just to open and close their window shutters, all in stealth of course.
---
...you think your hand scanner door can stop me and my super sledge? ¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)¬†
---
Thank you.
---
I found the mod.....had to spend 4 points to move my intelligence up to 5 and back just to install it but I'm at a point where I have a dozen points banked up.
---
I only tried it in VATS because it has 50% VATS critical damage so that will be my main use.
---
Found some cave crickets by my base......first shot a direct hit but the cricket didn't lose any health...... second shot I died, I think there was a tree branch in front of me.......third shot another direct hit but the cricket didn't lose any health.
---
Next test from the roof of the municipal center in Watoga. VATS locked on to a bot on another roof top. I launched 4 shots at him and not only did the furious modifier not seem to work but he didn't lose any health at all either. The good news is that I got some XP when I hit him so something died over there, just not my target.
---
Too bad I rolled furious on this otherwise God roll, I was holding out hope that maybe because of the multiple nukes with MIRV that I would be sitting on one of those unique weapons that would have the dupers throwing themselves at me. 
---
I don't know I don't quite see a pattern with this bug. Sometimes it works, I fast travel, boom doesn't work anymore. 
---
Yeah all that wood and water gathering to hold off thirst is THE BEST early on. 
---
but thats so many screws and gears
---
Honestly I just want them to add the ability to build those laser door things that are scattered throughout the white spring bunker and on the inside of fort defiance, only party and friends can walk through them, etc. It would be a great thing to have, and I don‚Äôt care if it cost the same amount of materials as the decontamination arch, it‚Äôs a must need in my opinion.
---
Help cost caps
---
Definitely a welcome and interesting read! Thank you for posting this for us.
---
Which would you say is the best looking power armor? I really like the look of the X-01 myself, but there's a significant amount of bias at work there. I remember what a bitch it was to find all of the Star Cores in FO4 to get it.
---
Oof, I‚Äôd save up though that‚Äôs pretty cool.
---
They should at least make weight-related perks apply in the stash boxes
---
Oh I agree. I am just saying that if it's a legendary you should look around. You may remember me the corpse near by. Also, when this happens I find that alot of the time the body is actually a meat pile rather than a corpse.
---
this week they will be doing object rename I plan to make all items I use 01 (item name) to stop this happening
---
also you can't seem to sell painted atom ship items 
---
Pipboy magical identity code thing!
---
yea, there is that.  
---
Secondary problem was high levels had been around; the lobby was mobbed by L48 mutants - could not get in to get the plans in the first place - I was &gt; L35 when I finally got in, didnt have all the mats I needed...got the mats, but every time I went back to build and register, L48 mutant mob again.  (didnt realize I could build it at any PA station)  At that point, I was only a couple levels away from 45, so no big deal to wait.  
---
 Ah another Child lost the Faith to the RnGesus. Don't be scared. RnGesus loves everyone and every kind. You just need to find your way back into Randomness and taste the fruit of Probabilities and percentages. The only thing you need todo is pray to our Lord and Savior! Find your Faith by turning your character in a circle just once, before you deal the killing blow on your juicy 3-Star Legendary and RnGesus will see it. 
---
How many free items have they had so far?  Sadly, I am going to miss out on this as I wont be home in time to redeem it.
---
That's very thoughtful, I'll have to try that!
---
It also makes even less sense when they physically drop the gun and sometimes you can pick it up and sometimes it's just a static item.
---
thanks for the PSA!
---
It was already going to be 50% off today (as per the weekly atom shop newsletter)
---
  :/
---
Laser pistol has a similar thing where I turn it on before I can shoot. 
---
Happens only if I unholster the thing, if I already have another weapon out and switch to my laser pistol I don't press the button, it feels like it's a faster animation that way. I'd guess revolvers have the same thing; Quicker to switch to, slower if unholstering.
---
Don't know if all weapons have a kind of "hidden" delay difference between unholstering and switching, or if it's specifically a pistol thing. The animation is cool but I'd like it to be quicker to match the delay of switching instead.
---
Use Sanboxie to do that. Your mule account might get banned if you're transferring high numbers of items and ammo back and forth.
---
Your welcome!
---
Not sure if that was mine but I will take credit. I leave all kinds of goodies in that cache (leather armor, lvl 1 or 5 legendaries, every plan and recipe with out a trade market value, all my extra ammo, water, food).
---
Overt but worthy of an upvote.
---
Really? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I feel ya man, ever since that update they did awhile back. I've killed roughly upwards of 60+ 2* and above legendaries and have only gotten 1 piece of armour that was more the 1*. And that one was an utter garbage roll wood armour
---
Surprise! You are the overseer.
---
Someone that would appeal to people who don‚Äôt play everyday isn‚Äôt going to be a limited time mode every couples months. That‚Äôs the exact opposite of what I want as someone who only plays on the weekend
---
Oops sent support tickets containing personal info to random people. 
---
Full team of empath no sentinel needed
---
That's not what happened.
---
 Eckhart's plan was to use the scorchbeasts (up until that point they were contained in the glassed cavern), Liberators (from under Mama Dolce's Plant), and super mutants from West Tek &amp; Huntersville to justify a perpetual state of DEFCON 1, which would let him launch unlimited nukes at China and anyone else he deemed an enemy. He needed a general to access the silos, and the only one that sided with him during his initial takeover had died of a heart attack. That's when he had MODUS implement the promotion system we all go through, so he could make a new general. The highest ranking soldier in the bunker, Colonel Ellen Santiago went through the process and became a general, but she refused to help when she found out his plans so he had her drugged and kept in a coma. 
---
He went ahead with his plan but the scorchbeasts and the plague were far more destructive than they were expected to be. In the chaos, soldiers still loyal to Santiago rescued her and arrested Eckhart. They then attempted to destroy MODUS. They failed to fully destroy him, but they did damage him, corrupting his program. He retaliated by sealing the bunker and gassing everyone left in it, including Eckhart.
---
True Wes-tek is one of my regular locations as well but I don‚Äôt run harpers ferry as much maybe I should hit there more
---
The missing mask event^^TM last week brought my screw count to nearly 900...I ended up scrapping well over half of them.
---
I'd have hung onto them for vending, but I've already got masks, plans, and tons of other things stockpiled.
---
I'm sure I'll regret it at some point though, but I'm about done building and scrapping weapons for now, so no short term use for them.
---
Prime receiver only one I have ever seen
---
Maybe they screwed it up even more recently but my description was spot on retested verified and confirmed for at least few months.
---
You can build it more than once.
---
"Haha haha guise April fools I give it 4 free" Hopefully they'll let his antics slide this one time
---
When you got the quest you should have got the recipe to make it.
---
Stockpiling and food storing would be cool.  Would need more depth to farming though. 
---
This has started happening only recently for me. Both in blast radius and out. Over 10 players both time all lvls 90~ to 400~ and yeah it heals and gets stuck at 75%~ all other mobs are destroyed in seconds so dmg is def there.
---
It's actually easy. Go to Wataga Train Station. Go west along the tracks and follow the tracks until you see an Assaultron walking along the perimeter wall. Kill it, and see if it drops the sword, scrap the sword, then you get the circuit board. If it doesn't drop the sword, server hop
---
&gt;  If millions were playing it you would constantly have full servers, while in REALITY, the 24 player cap is not even reached in every single instance you join.
---
While I doubt "millions are playing" (and nobody from Bethesda ever claimed that, the nearest they got was "millions *have* played"), I think everybody is still confused by the silly idea that "Bethesda have servers".
---
Bethesda don't have any servers.  The game runs on Amazon's server farm.  The "Bethesda servers" are VMs.  A new VM can be started at any moment.  It would be stupid of Bethesda to only start VMs when existing ones filled up -- it would increase peoples login times and make it impossible to join the same server as your friends.  I have no idea what algorithm they use, but ideally it would try to keep some free space on all running instances and simultaneously balance that with the aim of keeping as few instances as possible.  
---
What users should see is that "servers" are rarely full, and rarely empty.  That is what I tend to see.
---
I'm like this. Love rummaging through the environments.
---
Agreed!
---
I run into the new bees usually at train stations or during a quest. Then through chatting with them either via text or headset I find out what weapon they're using and what they need and if I have it or can easily get it I pass it along to them from person to person. I've also been summoned to rescue several when they're in a tough situation. The feeling of helping another is the best reward the game has to offer.
---
‚ÄúApexigod‚Äù on PSN 
---
How are you able to one shot the setup?
---
I was thinking in terms of weekly, because each week could be as little different.
---
I used to lock my stuff up, and then I realized how dumb that was. So now all my water purifiers and my extractor stay unlocked, in case anyone walking by needs some water or stuff from my extractor
---
If you strip the armor pieces off it you can still get into the frame. They have no level requirement and still provide a lot of bonuses (sets STR to 11, immune to fall damage, 60/60/60 damage/energy/rad protection).
---
Your two shot Fatman, does it still hurt after the change?
---
As long as someone doesn‚Äôt leave sticky tar along with a sausage recipe, I‚Äôm cool with it.
---
I think I have one or two to spare. On my survival character I have tick blood to trade, so you can craft if it floats your boat. But I will not be online for 5 or 6 hours. My IGN is Geneziz.
---
And by "harder" I hope you don't mean more grinding and more time consuming. Harder should be something like, it's OK for a sniper to one shot kill others, but only with a manual head shot at max range. Armors should be more focused on protection from certain types of weapons which would create weaknesses, so combat armor would be high against ballistic guns or blunt melee, but week against bladed weapons and energy guns. Not just OP'd to everything due to perk cards and standing still.
---
rickroll...Nice.
---
&gt; The duping bug took like a year to fix even though it's been known for like a decade.
---
You might like to check your time machine, I think it's malfunctioning.
---
Not sure if joke or not.  User seems to have had game experience and is creating a new character, yet has never encounter people leaving stuff at overseers stash or Flatwoods for new players?
---
Go into survival.
---
I have between 50 to 100 missiles at any time. When I have a quad barrel launcher it makes for great quick splodey damage. 
---
If I find full heavy legendary, leather or combat i‚Äôll Switch up
---
u/Jezz_X
---
Yeah, there should be an independent camp in survival.
---
Not sure what that means
---
I haven‚Äôt prepared for this at all. :( I guess I‚Äôll start tonight. 
---
Bulk it up and you'll be able to sell off to vendors, I make decent caps on bulk copper alone.
---
Sorry I meant monthly, so you would get four weekends per season, and things might stay a little more interesting.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if it was a bug. Annoyingly, ive killed probably more than enough no-starred legendaries, that if they did count, id have completed the challenge. I guess my frustration is the fact that im hunting them down when i can, but im getting more without stars than i am with.
---
Bulk wrapped junk can be sold to venders.  I sell what I don't need
---
I just scrapped by X-01 torso.... Luckily i prefer using core assembly as a mod so i hope it won't be that hard to find it once more...
---
This is such a big deal for me. I used yo br super friendly, always willing to team up with strangers. Then this happened with a guy using bloodied build, and it kind of ruined it for me.
---
Was replying to the other guy who said the only definition of a season is the seasons of the year 
---
Where is that posted? I found the older one but not the current updated one. 
---
I think they fixed that as well. It goes back into your inventory. Unless you really did drop it instead of placing it.
---
So you have 1 million armor value? I'm not reading your text right.
---
That's a great idea
---
When I'm in the event and shoot the SBQ a few times before helping clear out scorched I only get to loot her body about 1/3 the time, 2/3 times the body is empty.
---
Yeah i had my camp there for a while and was hoping some kittys might show up.  They never did but if youre like  me and like everything bulked the plastic is great!
---
You should definitely nuke them for that
---
Moslty by vats crit to head. Vats is the great equaliser.
---
Bulk and sell to vendors.  On days that I have accumulated way too much I sell without hard bargain on so I can sell more.  
---
Does the crossbow at least count as a stealth weapon (like a silencer on a hunting rifle)?
---
I build stuff and either trade it, scrap it to learn mods, or vendor it. Bulk junk can be sold straight to vendors, as can junk that can't be bulked, eg: Waste Antiseptic.
---
You can also donate it by leaving it in a suitcase at a train station or an Overseer's cache. Some high level players go out looking for new players and just leave them a paper bag full of useful stuff that they no longer need.
---
Makes sense to me. They're mad cuz he flexin. 
---
What are the other effects on the Bloodied plasma? 
---
Related PSA: Don't ever scrap an LMG to learn mods for it. There are none to learn. I found this out after scrapping several that I should have sold.
---
A character challenge "learn all mods for combat rifle" with a list of said mods would be great.
---
It is bulked, i just have way too much junk that i can't sell due to that cap limit on vendors
---
Most junk requires "Bulking" it before it can be sold to vendors. It bundles of a number of the material into a single junk item. You can do it at a Tinker's Workbench and requires plastic to do. 
---
sure IGN teflonted i should be on later tonight 
---
lol.  I forgot this one
---
Lucky ducky lol.  I always put one atom skin part on my armor just in case xD
---
If you use Bethesda launcher it's on the front page of fo76.  On my phone in bed I just went to the main fo76 website and "view more" news, it's about 4 articles down  https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6wzJHNfuM1wa2mGyDq62yD/fallout-76-new-items-and-sales-in-the-atomic-shop
---
or it's all a simulation
---
Ok....  you are 14 and committed to sharing the hate.  Good to know.
---
Happy upcoming birthday!  You're gonna love 15.
---
APRIL FOOLS,. It deducts the atoms from you upon purchase.    JK 
---
Unless the game stays the same with no rewards and you don‚Äôt have to make a new character then I‚Äôm good
---
Thanks. That site is a pain on mobile sometimes
---
Elder scrolls has the online thing down so well it‚Äôs almost too good lol 
---
Yeah I just wish it would hold more than 50 :/
---
Yeah took me a bit in mobile. Best bet is from the launcher but I guess that's probably a pc only thing.
---
Hell yeah, that's my favorite fallout moment ever
---
I got like 5000 for xb1. What‚Äôs ur offer 
---
Of course, go ahead.
---
Oh..in that case I could suggest becoming a junk vendor, I usually just dump excess like that in caches or workshop containers.
---
Thats the spirit now go raid the Wastland 
---
Make ammo that will help 
---
You mean like the parade they just had for a week?
---
I don't have time to become a professional golfer either so please make professional golfing more accessible to those of us with jobs.
---
But you can't lock onto someone that is cloaking correct? Do you have issues trying to find these people or is there a trick to it?
---
Here's the build, with Adrenal Reaction and a modded GR the damage is exactly 444 for me: [https://i.imgur.com/fVX8n4y.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/fVX8n4y.jpg)
---
What do I supposedly hate again? 
---
My group did it on PS4.  We didn‚Äôt get the volume of legendaries that appears at Whitesprings, but it was a good EXP farm, especially if you let the timer go.  All enemies are glowing ghouls except the Wendigo.  The event popped three times for us during the nuke.  The problem, of course, is that there‚Äôs not much else to do in that area between drops except farm flux.
---
Took me a long time.   Most successful runs were at whitesprings.  Wes Tek never reset. And yeah, put me on the same server a lot.  I found that crashing to desktop helped the server change
---
What makes them the worst? Are they not working as intended? I love that they added binoculars.
---
Yeah, I had the guy follow me around and kill me like 3 times, and then as soon as i set a bounty on him he left the server. So frustrating. 
---
Would be a bunch of stuff initially, then only a small handful every now and then, mixed in some trades for caps with players.
---
Wish they let us transfer between characters on the same account :|
---
You can get the t45, t51b, and t60 jet pack plans from watoga. And x01 jet pack mods from server hoping ten trillion times and going to the enclave vendor in the military wing.
---
&gt; T-60
---
&gt; A brotherhood of steel classic, T-60 is the pinnacle of T series. It lags behind T51b in stats
---
Really?
---
T51b: DR 455 ER 455 RR 310
---
T60: DR 400 ER 370 RR 415
---
Oh, yes T51b gives you better DR than T60, and way better ER (but who uses weak ass energy weapons) but look at that RR.  Where do you wear power armor?  In nuke zones.
---
X-01 gives you a bit more RR, but the eye-watering cost...
---
Unlimited he said
---
Find every Overseers's Cache and drop some in each. I check every container around every station just in case - yesterday I found some plans I didn't already know in a trash can. And I'm hoping someone somewhere yesterday did some whoopin' and hollerin' when they found those bobbleheads and magazines....
---
Usually there are a few idiots spawn camping somewhere, and if you avoid that spot it's usually fine. Aside from spawn camping pvp, regular random is actually pretty fun
---
If you can‚Äôt beat em join em man
---
As the other fella said, be mindful of how much you back and forth with your mule.
---
Beth said something along the lines of 'normal gameplay won't get you banned' but never defined what 'normal' is and having a mule account in itself can be construed as 'abnormal' already depending on how you want to look at it.
---
Either way you don't need third party software to run multiple instances of the game.
---
\- Copy 'Fallout76.exe' and paste it in the same folder. Rename it if you wish to for instance 'Fallout762.exe'
---
\- Go to Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76, copy 'Fallout76.ini' and 'Fallout76Prefs.ini' and paste them on the same folder.
---
\- Rename them to match whatever name you gave to the copy of the .exe, 'Fallout762.ini' and 'Fallout762Prefs.ini' if you used the name I used as an example.
---
\- If you don't want to type username/password each time you launch the game create a text file in the same folder as above (if you don't have one already) called 'Fallout762Custom.ini' (or consistent with whichever name you chose for your exe file).
---
\- Open the file in a text editor and add these at the very beginning of the file:
---
\[Login\]
---
s76UserName=your\_bethnet\_username
---

\- Finally for convenience create a shortcut to the exe on your desktop.
---
Done.
---
This would be really cool
---
Thanks. What mods are there besides heavy barrel or are their plans? 
---
1k
---
I put a USB thumb drive into the Ps4, then go to settings &gt; storage, find the game you want and go into it's screenshots folder, then you can select all and choose "transfer to device"
---
I just hit circle and exit they get the picture
---
You tell us.  
---
Gotta get them young.  just ask nike
---
What I've seen is conflicting.  Some suggest that it does work.  Others say that the Endangerol barrel is bugged and does nothing.
---
The reason for the weight limit exists is for server stability. If every player had unlimited Stash space, within two weeks full servers would probably crash in 2-3 minutes due to all the extra load.
---
I've mentioned it before but I will bring it back up again :)
---
Yeah, but lucky hole doesn't produce *lead* it produces *lead ore*.
---
Before mining lucky hole your problem is "where do I get lead".  After it's "where do I get acid".
---
I remember a level 15 tried meleeing me but does no damage and when I looked at him there is a paper bag in the groud with items
---
Thanks for the items I guess random stranger
---
That's really helpful, thank you very much!
---
U made a typo u added a zero
---
Fireproof puts an end to that. 
---
it's not their choice. there is no magic switch they can flip that would allow this to happen. the game and it's servers' stability is affected by the items we, the players, carry. there are only so many things that they can put in the world without breaking the game (literally, not from a gameplay or economic standpoint). 
---
They told us this when the game first came out with 400lbs stash space. they increased it to 600 to test server stability, and once they saw that everything was still cool, they moved it up to 800. i could see it being upgraded a couple more times throughout this year, but we will never see an unlimited stash. it's just not possible with this game's engine.
---
"Fair" is entirely subjective.
---
You must not have been here at launch.....
---
Omg I saw that too 
---
It‚Äôs not a quest, it‚Äôs a weekly challenge, for atoms. It‚Äôs impossible to drink 25 different types of alcohol without the tick blood tequila or one of its mixed drink versions
---
I've basically quit for the same reasons, I mean I'm level 200+ and have gotten my time out of the game but the drops are so bad. See a 3* legendary mob doesn't mean anything since you might get a drill or a non 3 star item. Right now it's the only end game there is. Maybe vaults and the legendary vendor will change my mind. 
---
It shows them lock picking 
---
As I have never played ESO could you be so kind as to give me an idea of how the do it? 
---
I'm actually quite interested. 
---
Best advice I can give; on my first character I wanted to be able to pick everything up and craft everything, so I focused on completely passive perks. I kept running into difficulty creatures, let alone other players, so I rolled a new one and focused on damage perks. Shotgunner, Expert Shotgunner, Master Shotgunner, Better Criticals, all 3 ranks of concentrated fire. Now I only struggle against the broken builds, like Assassin's Sentinel and some particular Bloodied ones. I actively avoid PvP, but when someone finally finds a way to force my hand, it does feel nice to usually be able to pull off a crit headshot and watch them fly away because of my quad explosive shotgun.
---
I still think they need to fully separate PvP and PvE, but until they do üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôm a little south from there, but much higher so my view is a bit better
---

---
Why?  I'm not getting any more caps being spawn camped.
---
Go find richer prey. 
---
I wouldn't mind heavily reduced price to go from train station to train station. Also if an event was half the normal travel cost I would do more of them.
---
I guess I could wait for the legendary vendor üëç
---
It‚Äôs currently not free or on sale right now on xb1.
---
As long as it‚Äôs not a explosive radium I‚Äôd take that trade if both were max lvl. 
---
It‚Äôs not explosive 
---
Except for me I'd hate to have to make my build just for one enemy. I have a very built for stealth and sniping build (can you see why I hate radscorpions, they're almost impossible to stealth, especially if you f' up and don't see them before they even sense you at all). I wish I had an instigating hunting rifle (it's my favorite sniping rifle in 4). I haven't really come across too many good legendaries yet, and I am not even sure I have found any legendary hunting rifles :( (I did get a good legendary 10 mm automatic).
---
But thanks for the tips if I do find an instigating one :).
---
That's in my head now, you bastard! &lt;desperately searches for another radio station&gt;
---
And level 50
---
I finally found someone (PS4) to make one for me yesterday so I could finish. Maybe put a ‚Äúwant to buy‚Äù post on one of the selling threads?
---
Syringers have a whole host of mods, similar to FO4. You have to scrap them to learn them though.
---
Just realised that I never replied - but I didn't crash again for a long time after swapping my helmet. Significant improvement thanks to you!
---
IMO, none should be like that.  If you teach the player a mechanic for something, you don't get to arbitrarily decide that the mechanic doesn't work for certain things.  That's bad design.
---
And honestly, there are no god-tier mods that need to be kept locked away.  You might support BoS Combat Armor from a narrative standpoint until they finish their quest line, but in general?  There's no need for this arbitrary restriction.
---
Sad panda, I just rushed and turned my Xbox back on while I finish getting ready to take my dogs out just to pick this up..damn it
---
That sounds similar to where I'm going.  My original character (only got her up to level 40) was a sniper build because that's how I play all Fallout games, but I kept getting my butt kicked.  So I am now focusing on a two hand melee build focusing on damage perks as well as defense boosting perks, and she's much stronger.  So now I run around with my spear and kill everything in one or two hits (for now, seems to be working).
---
I'd then use it to build low level armor and weapons, then leave in flatwoods overseer cache
---
Then it gets more complicated. If they are using stealthboy and sentinel assassin then I try to stagger them with my weapons and perks. Every 2nd shot from my QE harpoon tends to make it through that armor but its not oneshotting in such sitiation.
---
If they are instead using crouch and chameleon, then they are not standing still, they are crouching, and hence not receiving the standing still bonuses. Here chances are I'll oneshot them too without vats.
---
If they are both doing what they can not to be seen and to use tactical advantages, even lame ones such as cornercamping insides of buildings where they'll see you first, I tend to make sure the room is full of pulse nades and tesla rifle arcs before I get in to pick up their bag. No oneshots here either.
---
Stagger is the key to kill em for vast majority of builds that can kill them and how good your weapon is at applying stagger is crucial too.
---
Oh dang, it affects the Gauss now? I thought it didn't.  Yeah that's a reason to get rid of the mutation if that's the case.

 Beep Boop, I am a bot!
---
Or poison tips. Tesla tips. Puncturing tips, serrated tips. Hooked tips. There is a whole plethora of ways to make it a versatile weapon. On the same note I wish they would bring back ammo variants like in New Vegas. I sorely want my slugs and coin shot back.
---
each minute in game is a second. So 60 min =60 sec = 1 min   
---
so each 24 minutes is a full day   
---
12 minutes each cycle.
---
Ah yeah I saw your post the other day, thought it looked kinda "Lucky 38" ish
---
The LMG has no heavy barrel mod that I have seen. The wiki says the only mod is the prime receiver but that's learnable by plan only I think.
---
yep. and a lot of times I wouldn't even get credit when I did complete it.  also still haven't got discovery credit for places I know I've been too...all over the map like major places I can fast travel too.
---
I really dislike how many so things you do in game that the game tracks are not credited to you having actually done.
---
The lame black ui overlay that's supposed to represent the binoculars actually ends up taking up more space on the screen than a regular rifle scope would, kiiiinda making the binoculars obsolete for legitimate use other than just for the immersive feel. 
---
Is it max lvl?
---
What kind of radium? 
---
Hahah this makes me want laser swords in fallout
---
Agree. So I can stop picking up a certain weapon just to scrap it hoping for a mod
---
As far as I know yes. So do throwing knives and tomahawks.
---
Well, when Bethesda zeros out damage on CAMPs, yes.
---
But the same could be said about all of these security measures.  If it's not another player, then it's enemies (or even luring enemies) to a CAMP to damage it.  These are basically for flavor, rather than actual security.
---
Thanks bro! I have a lot more, I'mma upload an album soon
---
A bloodied level 50 3 star 
---
So my turrets don't seem to do anything.  They don't do too much damage and sometimes they don't even fire. 
---
However I've been torn apart by higher level turrets.  And they are useful for some people as an early warning system. 
---
Totally agree, the game should have never launched in the state that it was in. Which is honestly what caused a majority of the backlash and then the product misleads that happened as well did not help Bethesda in any way shape or form. 
---
With the NPC‚Äôs I have a feeling they‚Äôre coming as well in The Wastelanders  DLC. Mainly due that you see an opened vault and people running around on the cover for it. 
---
This. Exactly this. Once you hit level 50 and can grab super duper, you'll never run out of stims, to add onto this.
---
Use the butcher's bounty search option on the ticks to increase the chance of tick blood (even on ticks other people killed!) And sometimes you can get extra tick blood from the lil suckers, then just craft away~
---
Hardly but they fixed it a bit üòÇ I still play but it‚Äôs brutal sometimes. Not many blue screens now but monsters still disappear n stupid shit like that. 
---
It's 35 or 45, can't check till tonight though.
---
It literally is to make way for new content. It‚Äôs a good thing 
---
U can get the forest camo jumpsuit but they go for 6500 lol
---
I would really like text chat. And also it would be nice if our character name was visible to other players.
---
ESO is running their yearly Jester's Festival, which began at the end of March. About to wrap up in a day or less now. It's three yearly quests for silly Jester themed rewards and other such mischief or absurd. Like a pet rock or wooden horse stick mount.
---
Hey i woke up early wanna trade?
---
like any game that came out, it had its bugs and they are working to fix those, i'm honestly not sure where all the hate came from, i think this was/is a good game and is getting better with each patch.  No game is perfect on release... but that's just me 
---
Now the latest problem is all of these bandwagon kids coming from Fortnite with their toxic attitudes lol
---
A PvP emote
---
A fasnacht player icon
---
A party invite poster
---
An alarm clock
---
Varsity jacket
---
That's very thought provoking,  I like.
---
What's your source for it selling "very very well"? I'm curious to read/watch that.
---
One thing I've noticed is there are more people trying to get me to engage in PVP since survival mode has been launched. They are generally about twice my level (I'm only level 17). 
---
I generally ignore them and continue to go about my business. However, I did kill one of them after they destroyed a few walls in my camp. You can fuck with me all you want, but don't fuck with my camp.
---
I've thought about messaging them asking if they're upset about getting murked in survival mode and feel the need to take it out on lower level players.
---
Yeah but if you hop out of the world someone who isn‚Äôt a waste of space can join lol 
---
Hells yeah.
---
Aw, man, that's a shame. Was so excited for a West Virginia fallout. Such a cool concept.
---
Thanks.
---
I made another one on my alternate character.  It'l a lightweight version because of the smaller camp budget.  I made it 3x3 and put the workbenches on the roof.  I couldn't get the camp into the same spot in the tree, so it's a floor lower, but it's further out toward the edge of the cliff and that makes the view nicer.  Absolutely terrifying because my alt has no fall damage protection.
---
2k u can get them..ask on the market subs
---
I know that a lot of the hate was from people that never played it at all and never intend to try it. My youngest brother, 26, is a hard core fallout fan. Not like us tho. He's the type that says " anything other than 1,2,and new vegas , aren't true fallout games and all others suck. He calls me once a week to cuss me out for playing it. He claims f76 is the biggest offender of all , that all people playing it are brainwashed by Bethesda. And he brags about all the hate him and his friends have spread about this game. This I know is not the whole problem, but it's part of it.
---
You can sell those screws and gears for 2caps a piece. You don‚Äôt need a mic to trade and can set the price per unit so you get exactly what you want for them. Just make sure you have the buyer join your server. 
---
Not saying you shouldn't enjoy it, just wasn't for me on release. 
---
We could definitely use a keyring, it makes little sense to remove a feature and only clutters up the Misc tab more.
---
It‚Äôs only really worth something if its max lvl 
---
If u go to a craft bench u can ..the option will appear avail for crafting 
---
I finally got the deep pocketed combat armor chest plan yesterday, from an event (the name is escaping me atm) where I had to protect an eyebot named Rover (?) while it worked on a relay transmission building. Anyway point is that I hunted for that thing forever and gave up, so it was a real treat to find it 
---
Ah I see, 76 could definitely benefit from events such as that. The parade was definitely a good start.
---
They could just separate the two lists, say 8 learned and two acquired.
---
Pleasure.
---
T-51b is so easy to repair with power patcher and fix it good. I haven't repaired my armor in a month, and you only need like 6 silver and a dozen springs, and a token amount of steel and other stuff. 
---
Hey so yeah. Only starred legendary mobs count toward the challenge. Unstarred legendaries do NOT count. You also have to down them yourself. 
---
Your best bet at this late hour is not to cruise for legendarie in your normal haunts like WesTek. What you need to do is hit the events. Uranium Fever will (should) have 3x 3\* legendary mole miners. Normally they're not worth it since they only drop level 35/40 loot but the name of the game is _quantity_ not _quality_. Hit that 8 times server hopping and get one in the wild and you're golden.
---
If you want to mix it up a bit horde events generally have at least 1 2-3\* legendary and they're short and sweet and I've head leader of the pack up by Tyler racetrack has multiple legendary wolves but I only ever get level 10 vicious vanilla wolves.
---
Yeah and I think it is getting better. This next update I would say you should debate on coming back as there‚Äôs a new quest line coming. There‚Äôs definitely a lot less hair pulling bugs now 
---
Oh didn‚Äôt know there was market groups, this on reddit or discord or something?
---
It depends on what you want more . I sold my aa on xb1 for 7k two days ago non explosive. Bloodied deathclaw gauntlets used to sell for 10-15 but have come down quite a bit. As for bloodied radium idk haven‚Äôt seen one and have been looking myself. I‚Äôd personally go to 7k for one myself. 
---
Hahah I wish, but I'd prob actually whip put my trusty vampire's lead pipe and get to bonkin'
---
Adding a drop down menu of "FOR SALE" items to pip boy would help. You could move items there you would offer for sale and nothing else would be seen during a trade
---
and i get that too, there were some dealbreakers for people based on bugs, what was promised etc.. 
---
Classic standoff.
---
If it is max level what about would the price be?
---
I don't even pay attention to challenges. I just play the game, and get surprised with a few atoms when I happen to complete one without realizing it. Personally, I feel playing this way makes the game feel less grindy, but to each his own.
---
Can it apply enough rads to one shot them?  Curious.  Because most of those sentinel guys are rocking a vats crit that will one shot you back lol
---
I've got you. 500 is fine. GT? I'll come join u. I'm UnicornQueen971
---
And Only the First one!
---
Will do. Would love to enjoy this game.
---
LOL
---
I left a bunch of 1 star legendaries, ammo, purified water, and radom stuff last night. I dont think as many people will do it once the legendary vendor comes out.
---
I agree, the parade was a good start for something similar. More player involvement to work together, the better. I actually tired less of doing the Fasnacht event over and over because of the players response at the end of it. Doing quests by yourself and repeated daily for the event duration gets boring faster in my opinion and not as social.
---
No.  Please no. 
---
This is a different gsme from Fallout 4 and you need to curb the hoarding.  The game is doing all it can to push you into exploring and interacting and hoarding is in direct conflict with that.  Teddy bears don't weigh that much so I'm sure that's not the issue. 
---
Get rid of your low level stuff that you will never use again, sell those weapons and chems you've been saving for just in case, sell or dump your junk, and make it rain some of the 200+ stimpacks I'm sure you've collected. 
---
Exactly the state I was in but when I got my builds to my liking and my minimal camp is now all I need I kept hitting max caps so couldn‚Äôt sell. 
---
I finally went though my stash and carefully rationalised based on my repair needs, I ended up dumping until only 20 of each junk item was left, no ore, no Armor, no weapons. Kept flux and flux ingredients (just because), steel, copper, gunpowder and ammo related.
---
Now my stash fluctuates around 600 with aid items, chems and flux being the most weight, with Health-Factor I‚Äôm probably just going to dump my bulk health stuff. 
---
I need a few Chems to fire while fighting with hot keys, not sure why I‚Äôm keeping hundreds of psychobuff etc.
---
I‚Äôve stopped picking up stuff and no longer search dead things.
---
Perhaps I‚Äôll just sit in my camp and endlessly play instruments üôÇ
---
I think the sale nay have ended. 
---
So, you didn't transfer any gear from your main, but you expect other players to just give you gear? This makes no sense.
---
I have something to say. 
---
It's better to burn out, than to fade away!
---
Nothing game breaking honestly the one thing Bethesda did right was keep the funny glitches like sometimes a death claw might jump 40 feet in the air to attack a scorch beast so it‚Äôs honestly funny when I glitches the only real issue is the slight lag that comes along occasionally when fast traveling  
---
Highlander 2 is the only movie I have walked out on in my entire life.  It was that bad.  And the first one was very good.
---
If you love a franchise you criticize it. The hate was warranted.
---
I‚Äôve built a little shop selling just lever action rifles, can‚Äôt wait for this to be in game! üëç 
---
Well I‚Äôm offering on PS4. The person who has the 3 star death claw with 40% swing speed wants caps not a trade. 
---
You can if you have a PS4 and the remote play app! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I saw someone lockpicking a drone box, I'm not sure if they were just crouched or it was an animation
---
I don't know, but it feels as though I'm forever wandering in the dark. 
---
Instead of carrying around 1* crap to sell drop those and sell your junk instead. 
---
I‚Äôm not a big trader so I don‚Äôt know but probably 1-4K 
---
You can always put it up for bids and see where it goes. Bloodied weapons are really hot right now. 
---
Oh boy if you haven't yet don't check out the rest, I would argue that the forth(?) One staring only Duncan is the worst of the bunch.
---
There can only be one?
---
There *is* only one.
---
Adrenal Reaction
---
Yes but for more mainstream holidays. 
---
I got it from WWW.I-Made-It-Up/as/a/joke.com
---
I'd imagine it would be that sheep costume we see in the trailer.  Might even be a function of the quest, actually - dress up and pretend to be a sheep to lure the Sheepsquatch to you.
---
All those tjings are part of 1 build, yes you can do those things and then need a new character for anything else.
---
Not everyone wants to be without power armor
---
Some of us want builds for pistols sniping, talent diversity on the same hero.
---
I agree there are options, but its a matter of opinion which you don't seem to get, i genuinely have 2 lvl characters , lvl45 and lvl 93 and i feel so restricted by them and want more points.
---
Thats what kept me going for a bit, the legendary vendor.  Ill check it out, but not really worth it to buy it.  I could have spent 8k caps on facebook and bought what i wanted but that ruins the fun.
---
A level 68 Super Mutant had a mini gun lighting me up, I killed him and they had 3 caps, a board, a almost dead laser rifle... This literally happens all the time! 
---
I gave too much to RnGesus during my Destiny 1 years lol
---
Since adding the bloody mess perk, I've noted 
---
a) enemy bodies aometimes take flight when killed
---
b) if they dissolve to a bloody mess, then the little parts are hard to find.
---
c) both of the above.
---
Killed a legendary glowing Wendigo @ whitespring golf clubhouse - went to loot, no body, no meatpile, nothing in the vicinity.  
---
Finally found small bits if it in the next room...
---
On PC there is no brightness setting.  I wish there was because I would like it to actually be dark at 1am and not look like it's noon.  I never have to turn on my light except on the mire.  I think it should be really dark and completely pitch black in the mire... right now it's too bright.
---
 üòÉ
---
a empty frame should give 60,60,60, very strange ./
---
Running is funny! I always laugh seeing players run. Looks like someone almost can't make it to the bathroom! lol
---
Unfortunately it doesnt make sense if you've ever played a Bethesda fallout or elder scrolls game :(
---
I can say from first hand experience that the reward is what your current level is when you complete the quest. I triggered the quest in my 20s and waited until 50 to finish it. I was awarded a level 50 All Rise.
---
I do it all the time. Just load main account through Bethesda launcher and then use the .exe and manually log into the 2nd account, just as you said. I run the game in windowed mode and alt tab between the two. You can fast travel for free to a friend, so just friend your mule account. If you have mules that are encumbered you can get them killed and then use the friends list and spawn at your main character. I run both my accounts during my play time, I group up with my mule and share the xp charisma perk with my main, and periodically alt tab over and loot my mules resource extractor at that camp. Cant die to hunger or thirst if you make them sleep in a bed while your not using them. Make sure to stash junk first. Having another free fast travel point is cool. I have no friends. I'm so alone... I'm literally playing with myself.
---
what platform, I will buy your screws
---
Becoming a professional at something is only somewhat limited by accessibility. I think the lack of talent may be your issue.
---
I assumed that costume in the trailer was a man pretending to be the sheepsquatch, just before he gets his just desserts. 
---
Not OP, but it really isn't. First of all, you seem to forget that t-51b has better energy resist than x01 (by 1 point)
---
RR is mostly irrelevant because power armor and hazmat suits have a rad reduction separate from RR that negates like 90% of all rads, 300 rr from a radshield changes my rads/sec in nuke zones from 1.8r/s to a whopping ... 1.79r/s. 
---
Agreed, Although if the combat mechanics of the game were improved and balanced a bit more(e.g. a level level 500+ player and a level 1 player had access to all the same weapons and perks) or maybe a slight advantage to the higher player(no more then 10%, you still have to encourage people to want to level up), I think it would be better. 
---
For example I prefer Call of Duty multiplayer mechanic from an FPS perspective with no vehicles on the map(\*\* I know this franchise has had vehicles on its map in the past but they moved away from this), and Battlefield from multiplayer mechanic  FPS with vehicle on the map.  Both of these franchise have a Run-Shoot or Run-Aim- Shoot (E.g. Drawing the weapon up to an aiming mode) mechanic which is way smoother and much faster. The aiming mechanic in-particular is far better if you pull a gun up to aim it locks dead center for \~.5 sec with no sway but then adds sway for more realism  but also does not hinder to much the situational awareness of the, by allowing the player to \~15-20% of the field of view to each side of the scope. Lastly I don't know if anyone else notice's or has noticed that every scope/gun/combo also has a different draw center point (when aiming) on the screen when drawing up to aim sometimes up to \~10 pixels(This maybe needs it own post in bugs, not sure though, any who wants to post this to bugs may do so freely if they would like just shoot some credit my way as well)... this could be part of the associated sway mechanic of the game(see previous). Please note how ever I do not support how both of these franchises ( and many others) are moving towards loot boxes or randomized weapon rewards as a mean of progression vs just hard work to get to the weapon/build you want.
---
&lt;Suddenly remembers I never went back for the reward...&gt; D'oh! I really need to get on that.
---
I have to agree,I enjoyed seeing the Event pop up as I knew there would be others joining in and sometimes myself and others worked together to take one tactical escort roles( snipers, point takers, and bringing up the rear). 
---
It was nice to see random people working together for a change. As for the the repeatables an other quests they do become tiresome after awhile, but certain ones I'll grind into the ground and out the other side till I get what I'm after from said events.
---
I‚Äôm playing through my TV so that might be why my experience is different.
---
Oh No üòÇ . But I think the most terrifying April fools joke would be "Login Failed: This Account is Not Authorized Error " and a ban email.
---
Regardless of level, if you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôd be interested in checking it out!
---
Wait are you actually joking? Bethesda arent seriously zeroing out player damage on camps are they?!?! Everyday I'm more and more glad I stopped playing this game lol what about nukes? Surely they arent making them nuke proof?!?!
---
I think you might want to wear a condom next time and stop trying to change the game over your life decisions.  "I smoke too much meth, make food cheaper" or just be an adult and live with your choices.
---
Also lag/ glitch  most likely.  I really can't count the number of times I've been slamming my gauntlet at someone and it just doesn't register
---
Sorry mate on PC :(
---
I think I know the answer to this but just wanted to confirm... Even if you scrap a weapon (or an armor piece) but don't learn a new mod that doesn't mean there aren't anymore mods to learn for that item from scrapping right?  
---
I thought Many a True Nerd's playthrough was pretty good.  He obviously has issues with the game, but he really did get into the whole connect-the-dots nature of its lore, and he conveniently edits out the slower bits.  76 isn't the most exciting game in the world to watch someone else play.
---
Definitely no changes to character would be wanted, just some changes to the environment. They already have the verdant seasons etc. but just to no weather effects or other factors.
---
Oh well! Better luck next time then, yeah? I hope you find the perfect buyer. x
---
Are there any perks that reduce stagger chance?
---
Christ, I love this idea. I‚Äôve been at the same camp for over a month because it took so much time and effort to build, I can‚Äôt bring myself to tear it down. But I *really* want to build something new. But my camp is so, so cool. But I *need* to scratch that building itch. But...but...
---
Just because it‚Äôs Bethesda doesn‚Äôt mean we should excuse it‚Äôs buggyness.
---
It's not the way how it works. 75% and 40% are not additive, I think it removes the 75% of the damage first then it also removes the 40% of the remaining damage. I have full set of assassin/sentinel armor and there is a slight drop in my HP when somebody shoots me while I'm not moving.
---
THIS is actually a huge issue of mine as well. Ive done plenty that should be marked as completed. Discovery and thensome.
---
I recommend DansGaming
---
Pneumatic armor mod but its chest only and its either that or dense. Dense reduces explosion damage by a lot.
---
The end game may actually be Reddit76, I‚Äôm searching for the ScorchBeast thread so I can get a 3* vanquishing bloodied toilet brush to hang in my camp loo üòÄ
---
My party that I normally quest with has made this a weekly thing. Normally on our "material gathering" night when we are restocking ammo and materials for crafting. Since we are hanging in low level areas during this time anyway, we find a random low level player and invite them to join us and we basically escort them through their missions, or even occasionally take them on events in high level areas so they get the exp. It's fun watching a level 4 jump to level 20 in a matter of hours while we grind and get material we need. 
---
Afterall, in a post apocalypse world we would all be needing help, unless we were raiders of course
---
I've been playing since beta. It was a shit show for those first few months. Many people quit playing. Many people complained. Most of it was justified, but some people were also saying how bad it was and they had never even played it. It pretty much became a way for youtubers and game reviewers to get quick clicks because there was a lot of drama surrounding Fo76 in those days. 
---
However, today the game is 1000X better. All the missions work now. You don't get disconnected at random. Some enemies have been fixed. Most of the early bugs have been ironed out.  Balance issues were addressed for the most part. New survival mode... ect ect ect. I paid $60 and originally didn't get my money's worth. But I hung on and now feel like it paid off.
---
Will the people who left ever come back? Nobody I know is going to touch it ever again. Is the game getting new players? Yes, and most of them post on here about how confused they are about the bad rating the game has gotten. 
---
At one point it may have felt like this was a cash grab for Bethesda, that maybe they didn't even really care. But the last few patches (Feb/March) have redeemed them as far as I am concerned. 
---
I look forward to what this game will evolve into. 
---
Camp somewhere in the middle of the map. Free to fast travel to your camp.  Then cheaper fast travel to the outskirts.  
---
Hoping the sheep squatch is like a boss battle. Kinda doubt it though. People have reported their workshops being attacked by them. Lol . 
---
Well, I'm here because my game just crashed and in the launcher it says "install" instead of play even though the files are still on the drive. Good times.
---
It does that? I gotta get one of those now, so I can have each
---
You can save your caps man. Buy them from someone. I sell mine for 200c each
---
I really like marsupial. Healing factor and speed demon are also good ones
---
Last thing, remember that often (if not every time) a patch will mean a new exe.
---
You will have to manually delete the old copy and create a new one.
---
For your sanity name it the same as the old one, that way you won't have to rename the ini files.
---
However very rarely a patch will mean new ini files. In that case you have to go through the process again or things will get... screwy.
---
As in 'halp, I is falling through da world' screwy.
---
I mostly fast travel because I often only have an hour or two to play and need to get stuff done. 
---
Thanks! And thanks for clarifying that i have to be the one to down it.
---
he's saying "my kingdom for a horse", he's saying he would give all his caps for that feature to be added
---
Um, yes?  This has been known for about a month now.
---
It won't be true of Survival mode, so if you want to go around smashing CAMPs, you'll still have the option.  And even better - you'll get to enjoy others doing it to you too!
---
Depends on ur play style. Try getting legendries that compliment how u play
---
Nope...I live in a state considering medical marijuana....I work in healthcare...am an advocate for legalization. IMO if alcohol and tobacco are legal and they are worse than marijuana...then marijuana should be legal...and taxed. Also I do not believe my hard earned tax dollars should be spent on keeping a marijuana user/seller/distributor in jail.
---
Idk what to do and it‚Äôs annoying 
---
I had the opposite experience.  I experienced little to no griefing normally, and was actually pretty excited by the slap damage reduction to 0%.  However, the griefers just changed tactics.
---
I normally grid workshops for XP and plans before getting down to business, but I've found that since messing with workshops is now the only surefire way to get hostile status I'm seeing hostile players there in about half my games, where there was none before.  Owned workshops seem to attract them like flies now,and I'm in the minority group of players they interact with.
---
Survival, on the other hand, I love to play when the rest of my squad isn't on (for the +20% xp when I'm not getting +15% for inspirational).  However I'm farting around in the Toxic Valley which seems pretty out of the way for everyone else, that might change with my focus.
---
Wait it does?? Seriously?? That's awesome!!
---
Does it do the same in FO4??
---
You should research the upcoming patch changes so that you can educate yourself on the matter. THEN you can get enraged after you have learned the facts for yourself.  
---
Yeah but there are other off ones that I know I'm not aware of. For example home defense is needed for crafting base stuff and that takes 3 agility. Another user said ammo Smith take 2 agility which I didn't know
---
Dual bar would be better, but it currently doesn't work. Once I attached it the listed damage didn't increase and enemies weren't going down any faster so it's not a hidden increase.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I'll notify the team
---
Fond memories of first time playing FO4 in survival mode -- throw molotov, die.
---
Just joined you guys on there :)
---
Insect horde invasions would be both terrifying and amazing.
---
Yeah I've had issues with the base level turrets having issues firing in PvE workshop defense.  I heard the same thing when I asked about that too - that higher level turrets don't seem to have the same issue.
---
I currently have an auto sim limbs. But I also like sniping enemies from afar if I can. If not my other favs are the combat shotgun and all rise.
---
I guess what I want to know is what each armour offers in term of protection
---
Yeah I like dense I use it on my current build with fireproof to negate explosive dmg.
---
Thank you!
---
No one can get into my survival home either.....its just the camp device and a stash box clipped into a large tree in the middle of the woods.
---
With a bench stored away for on the fly scrapping.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call the Atom Shop or it‚Äôs items canon
---
it's called DPS, look it up
---
Oh - and look up. Couldn't find my bag once and it was 10 feet up in the air. I apparently died mid-explosion flip.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think it has to do with the rewards from the quests but rather doing the same quests over and over. They just aren‚Äôt very fun and seem to result in a lot of wasted time doing something you‚Äôve already done a hundred times over.
---
it's called DPS, look it up...
---
I guess technically because I don't have walls, everyone is already in my camp.
---
Yeah but the paint tho :p
---
The reward im speaking about isnt atoms, its a legendary weapon only available this week. Otherwise, im right there with ya.
---
Also the bigger lesson of:  these factions would have survived had they worked together and combined resources.
---
The Overseer herself mentions it.  
---
it's super frustrating as it seems a very simple coding error to fix. like every other tiny thing.  sure  they are tiny things but when there are so many it gets old fast.
---
from what I see scrapping things give a chance of learning something new, its not guaranteed.
---
I'm hoping it's a badass too like an OTT deathclaw creature where even high level players would have a hard time battling it alone.
---
Having it have some jump scare ability too would be amazing, It's  one of the reasons I love the mothman. One minute your walking around and then bam, the f#$ker is right in your face and you jump outa your seat lol
---
I greatly appreciate the information!
---
I know for example combat armour offers balistic protection, leather, robot armour offers energy protection. cant remember the others lol
---
OMG yes, that's a great idea. I drives me nuts that there isn't just a "keys" tab, and I have to shuffle through all those keys/passwords to get to other things, and you can't drop or stash any keys
---
Magic cannibals?
---
Thanks, dude. I'll give it another look.
---
People doing this annoy the hell out of me. I always try and randomly team with someone if they are near a place I'm trying to travel to in order to save the caps. I usually even offer to help them if they are on a quest as a thanks before moving on. Lately fewer people seem willing to team, and I suspect these scammers and baters are to blame
---
Ok thanks
---
If you click on the forest area challenge it will pop up another menu of where to take pictures. In the forest you have to take pictures in specific areas, in the other regions you don't. 
---
r/market76
---
My .50 call sniper and .308 bos sniper do this.
---
My wardrum and my grogaxe do this.
---
Sometimes when I switch back with left on the dpad I have NO weapon equipped.
---
I must pray to rngesus before every battle 
---
Definitely would love Bethesda sneaking in some new mobs with immunity and such. Make us use new weapons and tactics!!
---
Vanguard if you do high health, Bolstering if you do low health. Go the the armor tab on this link for descriptions.
---

---
That place was creepy as hell after reading about the previous inhabitants.
---
How is that relevant at all with what I was saying? Especially as it was the day before? I'm guessing you're one of those teens that love shoving your politics into everything LUL 
---
12 btw
---
I visit this house daily for this reason ... I almost drooled the first time üòÇüòÇ
---
I wish the nights were darker, but in any case keep a light on much of the time to help me find junk in corners.
---
I bet even Beth doesn't know answer. As long as there is no damage feedback or addon like Recount from WoW, its a "Schr√∂dinger's cat" - it works and doesn't work same time.
---
I found the other subs but I see it‚Äôs deleting people‚Äôs responses linking me to them, thanks people :)
---
Wow thanks this is great
---
Omg thank you so much for this. I feel silly now that I see it was as simple as highlighting it. I just assumed they'd all be the same haha.
---
Yea I know, I didn‚Äôt know what he meant at first
---
Can agree, how terrifying would it be to face 12-30+ ants or stingwings.
---
Maybe even re-introduce the other ant variants like fire ants etc..
---
I like to use my switchblade just for the equipping animation.
---
Thats two additional layers of protection against explosive damage and thats what makes explosive damage well balanced (except the organic craftable explosive weapons, they suck).
---
Add Bird bones to.
---
Marsupial,Speed demon and Bird bones
---
Never said we should. I‚Äôm just saying why would people buy it just to blame the bugs, when it‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs going to have bugs.
---
It‚Äôs like ordering a fish even though you don‚Äôt like the taste then complaining the taste is bad. 
---
Why did you enclose hand in quotation marks?  Are you implying you scan something else for your C.A.M.P. scanner access?
---
Beep-object larger than user‚Äôs stored data-access denied.
---
Absolutely. Making it so every mod can be learned by scrapping would be better than making a complicated UI. 
---
In FO4 and Skyrim I use mods to make night look realistic and require light. I wish that was an option.
---
Shit you're a lucky man! I'm still waiting on a half decent legendary, if it at least to avoid scrapping it
---
Or spiders, centipedes, slugs, etc
---
Nothing worse that the launch of New Vegas. The million bugs that game had at lunch can still be seen on videos.
---
With this post you brought all the toxic kids from the other fallout sub. 
---
They can't stand that this game is selling well and they are turning it round.
---
Use it to plan you perfect armor.  Like Vanguard with AP Refresh and a weight reduction or maybe Sentinel/Cavalier. I use this link often (not my doc).
---
Yes it does! That‚Äôs how I first found out about it, and when I saw we could make them in 76 I was really hoping they ported over the movement feature too.
---
Thankfully they did!
---
Yeah, which is a fun spin on the "faction war" concept.  This is essentially a faction war where you *didn't* show up in time.  Guess what?  Everyone got killed.
---
Maybe I just find the concept tired after New Vegas, but I kind of liked seeing it undermined.  You have all these strong-willed factions, and yet they are held in, and maintain, a perfect stalemate until you show up.  It feels phony to suggest they are strong, and yet they are completely subservient to me.
---
Here, I feel ordinary and unimportant, which goes back to the futility thing, and I kind of like that.  This is just "me" surviving in a wasteland.
---
Cazadores...
---
Ok so far is looking like
---
Intelligence:20 (for crafting perks and max durability
---
Luck:3 for super duper
---
Agility: 3 (for ammosmith/homedefense)
---
Perception: 3 for green thumb and butcher's bounty although I may do 4 and leave these both equipped permanently 
---
Which leave about 20 left I really feel like I'm missing one of the weird ones for base crafting but this seems pretty complete
---
Sorry mate been on nightshift so ended up snoozing but keen to join ya soon. I still havent had a nukashine on 76 so thatll be cool. You on tomorrow?
---
Assassin/sentinel, assassin/cavalier for pvp protection
---
Unyielding for damage output [can be unyielding/sent or cav]
---
Chameleon/sentinel for the invisible effect but still have good protection while standing still/jumping
---
Vanguard can be good if you maintain high health
---
Bolstering if you don't [both are more for PVE]
---
Heavy variants offer the most protection, with heavy metal having the most ballistic protection,  heavy combat having a good combo of both ballistic and energy. Marine is pretty good as well and popular [heavily duped in the great PvP variants, same as combat armor. Looks cool too imo]
---
Achilles heel is radiation damage. Be sure to have radaway keyed up and pop a radx[diluted if mutated] or radshield in order to mitigate the gamma gun user. 
---
Say what? I thought all challenges rewarded atoms only. What have I been missing?
---
Wow... gotta be said that's totally bull in my opinion! Half the concept of this game was every person you met would be another player and in any online game like that theres the risk of your camp being attacked! People just want it too easy and safe now! By the end of it that was my only source of fun going round and wrecking other peoples camps and getting notified my camp was under attack and fast travelling back to defend it and starting little turf wars! Wasnt aware its month old news now I'm out the loop on updates (haven't played since like mid december). Questipn from someone who hasn't played this year to someone whose clearly still playing what's the duped OP weapon situation like? One of my big reasons for stopping was that every Tom dick and Garry had an OP TSE that could solo a scorch queen and it just wasnt fun when everyone could one shot everything. I've heard some reports saying they got rid of all the duped ones and seriously nerfed the damage on the remaining ones but then I've also heard some people say the nerfing wasnt enough and there was another doping glitch straight away so it's not really changed atall. Your opinion?
---
Just take comfort in knowing you are not alone in this.
---
Yep, the four quadrants of the face plate separate and move away, revealing your face. 
---
I did the same thing, now I have an assaultron, a sentry bot, and an eyebot helm, and change between the three regularly.
---
Oh god no
---
Have you checked the audio settings for chat?
---
I've noticed recently that it will just randomly decided to turn itself all the way down for no good reason. 
---
I've gotten into the habit of checking my audio settings every time I load in anymore.
---
probably easiest to get another empty fram and see if the bug goes away, there are a lot of spawn places for frames, probably takes me max 10 mins to find one :)
---
I can't be the only one who is really freakin' tired of the alcohol themed challenges, right?
---
Deep dish on a gamma gun at least, does 125 rads per hit. Radium rifle is considerably less, though i dont know what mods do to it. Still, drops bloodied builds in one hit generally, so its a han solo situation. 
---
Could deffo see spiders in the game and wouldn't be too difficult for Bethesda to just cut and paste the ones from skyrim into it.
---
Put them in the mire where it's dark and gloomy and even have webs players can accidentally get caught in ( especially if they aren't expecting them because Bethesda didn't say they were putting them in lol)
---
Ok well all frames in my inventory are likely this sooooo
---
Lately, I've noticed the in-game chat audio settings on ps4 just turn themselves all the way down. I've had to change it back every time i log in.
---
This one will give you armor stats for comparison.
---

---
I think your other reply got auto deleted (only you can see it?) but I'll continue to troll/address your concerns here.
---
I feel bad for kids these days being raised by self entitled adults.   Stop using your kids to try and get sympathy.   You may not have specifically said "nerf" but your implications is that it's too hard because you need to spend time with your family.   Otherwise why bring up the kids?  Explain this to me. 
---
I would also like a text-chat feature added, at least a local one.
---
I'm actually a little glad that the game has forced me to use voice-chat because I absolutely 100% wouldn't do so normally. I haven't had any bad experiences *yet* in 76, but in other online games and MMOs I have had a really awful time once people know I'm a girl. Having had only good experiences so far, I'm actually kind of heartened by this, but I am still bracing for the inevitable bad egg.
---
My biggest gripe with there being no proximity text-chat is that often my mic is just not working, either because of the game or my set-up. If they could even implement an emote to this effect, that would be a great help if they're married to voice-chat only. :(
---
Make a new alt, drop friend 10 beers, friends drop you 10 beers, challange done in 20 minutes
---
Don't worry it's all part of my strategy to rid Appalchia of the dreaded TSE handmade rifle
---
you sell recipes for 200 caps? if so, are you on ps4? still missing a few recipes myself i need to get.
---
Home defense is in agility as well
---
im here daily for 50 plastic
---
you don't? i mean the challenges are there for something to do they aren't mandatory.
---
Ah, well I have both, I actually found a 1 star bloodied radnium rifle the other day, maybe I'll see how it plays out lol
---
Would love that and dread it in equal measure lol
---
Nice looking build!
---
Since you're on PS4, you should join our C.A.M.P building community, Construction Corp. 76! We build camps, do planned events, and video builds along the way.  Here's the latest video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrzZ64gGKd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrzZ64gGKd8) (mine starts at 25:15).
---
Enclave officer uniform + Sentry bot helmet = WET
---
i bought it 3rd party for 40$ at launch. Got to play BETA etc. Don't really regret it. My friends got it for 10-15$ and that seems like a truly fair price for what was given IMO
---
The lack of choice is what I miss most. Do I blow up Megaton or not? Either way I complete a quest. We don't have that in '76.
---
Awesome! Thanks for that :) 
---
2nd reply, also does 125 rads = 125 hp lost? I have not messed with these before so very curious.
---
Eh I would do bloodied for the most dmg and assassins sentinel running fireproof and dense mod. If you also add stealth you‚Äôre golden
---
I have. 3* with the +250 reloading armor buff, VATS critical and armor reduction. But my regular pipe pistol does more damage, it's sad because I specced specifically for the crossbow on this character.
---
Having a dog with me will make me feel less lonely
---
Xbox sorry mate :l also how much are they in modus?
---
Are you crouching before you enter the power armor?
---
It is kind of rare, but if a Watoga bot gets in visual range of the BOS bot, they attack and usually summons more to defend. BOS fights back, and kicks butt.
---
So basically. And I put this in it's own comment above. It should be 3 in perception luck and agility and 25 in intelligence according to another use so I can max out durability
---
Yeah, like its been mentioned, there are people who sell the serums for 200-300 caps on each console. You could have all the ones you want for the same cost as the ones in the MODUS Terminal. 
---
Then you would never see another player at all. Maybe only the top players should show up on the map as a sort of compromise.
---
Pretty easy with a low level character I would imagine
---
Someone will still just shoot it down / the wall next to it. 
---
I get the stalemates presented before.  NV had multiple factions who managed to keep each other in check until the courier tips the scales.  And in 4 their wasn't much of a stalemate until the Brotherhood shows up and destroys the status quo the Institute enjoyed.
---
But you are right about 76.  It's wonderful because it's a reversal of their normal trope and you aren't Lone or Sole or Dragonborn, your just one of many people sorting through the wreckage of 2 apcoalpyses. 
---
Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!
---
This... May not be the most exciting thing to do but going from lvl2 to lvl5 is what? Half an hour and a quick trip to Overseer camp &gt; Flatwoods?
---
In the end of the day the have to make the 'or we will sell you the Atoms instead?' appealing somehow, and the way to do that is making acquiring Atoms in game awkward and grindy.
---
Red dot sight for the crossbow is all I ever wanted. Or really any other sight, the ironsight is pretty terrible
---
That's awesome! Ty!!! I just found one last night in FO4 and it looked different than when I picked it up but I couldn't put my finger on it lol.
---
It‚Äôs a corpse, and most random encounter spawns are centered in bare dirt 
---
They removed from a narrow list of commonly duped items, but they allowed dupers and their customers to keep one.  Two-Shot and Explosive effects were nerfed pretty drastically.  The current meta is now the low-health Bloodied build with lots of flat damage reduction perks, and TSEs are easily foiled by Dense mods or the Fireproof perk, so it kind of worked out in the end.
---
People who were banned for duping were unbanned at some point, however, as many went right back to duping, they all got banned again.
---
And like I said, if you prefer a conflict-rich environment, that's what Survival mode is for.  It's neither easy, nor safe, for anyone.  Whereas, in what's now Adventure mode, there was a rash of high-level players deliberately steamrolling low-level players who had no chance of fighting back.  In Survival, there's always a bigger jerk.
---
And is it really useless to try it in a PA? T51b with Emergency Protocols or Stealh Boy perhaps?
---
Nice to see that half the community is as arrogant and up it's own ass as ever üòÇ
---
Not even ! Whatever I do, it happens (well nothing happens) after I did some repairing or mods.
---
Hot damn that's awesome if it's true. Do you have a link or anything like that to where he said that?
---
Keep in mind though that there are no sneak attack damage multipliers in pvp
---
thx thats a good info.
---
Nah they sell the serum themselves. Not the receipes
---
Not everyone has/wants/ can use a mic though. Visual representation is the easiest path.
---
Really? Every time I get meat wings or bones a legendary weapon or armor and decontamination shower plans. Ive killed her a dozen times and always have gotten something
---
You have to say where in the world, as well as which system -- Amazon server farms are regional.
---
New challenge: *kill scorchbeast queen while intoxicated by Cranberry Moonshine and have no armor on*
---
But seriously these challenges are getting old and most of them are a pain to do
---
For the recipes its like 10k or something outrageous like that. Usually only see people selling serums for 100 to 250 caps havent run across anyone selling the recipes on ps4 for less 1500 to 2500 caps. Ya got my hopes up.
---
And the level normalized content of ESO to boot. There are alot of good lessons learned in ESO that they should being over
---
I did not know that about those weapons....i musta sold 4 of the things because I thought they were a useless gimmick.....Today I learned üòûsmh
---
PS4 here, nah you pretty much nailed it with this
---
Just sell a bit Day by day and stop collecting you‚Äôll get back to normal soon
---
I‚Äôm also trying get the ‚Äúlearn 76 recipes ‚Äú challenge done. It‚Äôs a long haul.
---
Happy to help! See you in the wasteland!
---
So, to clarify a little, do you have 2 Bethesda accounts? And two copies of the game, one on each account? Long story, but I have 2 copies of the game on one account and I tried opening a second game but it logged the other one out.
---
I have dismantled more radian rifles than I'd like to admin and I think I have all the mods... I crafted a lot of those...
---
Not to mention the amount of screws they cost to actually craft.
---
Junkies rolling pins and nocturnal pipe wrenches are all I want in life.
---
I also do this, and the cash registers at each vendor can hold lots of unwanted plans, outfits, headwear, and unwanted ammo.
---
Hell yea what about a mod that shoots laser arrows 
---
You‚Äôre welcome! Godspeed, fellow wastelander!
---
Nani!?
---
no. it removes mutations as well
---
Weekly is craft 15diferent alcohol i am level 200 with 12 recipes so far. Noe doing biv, but this is really stupid. 
---
True, but even the recipes can be had for far cheaper.  Most I've seen get sold for around 3-4k, a far cry from the 18k in MODUS. 
---
Nope. Not that im aware of. Same thing happen tp me after i moved my camp within my area. Messed it all up and i had to rebuild. 
---
Have you moved your camp node?
---
Power armor is ridiculous weak in PvP. I knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be the strongest but it‚Äôs surprisingly ineffective.   
---
Oxhorn has a good bit of livestreams as well as lore videos. 
---
Yes but just 3 times or so in 600 hours of gameplay. Very light snow only.
---
Oof yeah that's hefty. Back in the day I bought a bunch of recipes for 500c each. So I've been holding onto them for people without a lot of caps.
---
I killed a crowned glowing wendigo at a lake house, and the body fell through/under a wooden boat. I can see it, and can't loot it and it's killing me.
---
And doing Bivs daily challenges should be helping that
---
My camp is atop a junk pile. I use plenty just from crafting to unlock mods. But as a rule, I farm plastic from any highschool, bulk it, and keep a max of 20 bulks before I sell excess. And anything that doesn't bulk I hang on til I get a stack of 100 then sell down to 50. I've rarely had to farm anything other than plastic due to this. And I can quickly max my vendor sales every day. 
---
So i will make new character i dont want play every 3days? Cool. 
---
Yeah it is doable, but stupidly. Thats why they need to stop!
---
I'm on PC, if you're still available to craft the Raider Shielded.  I've been farming for months and have nothing to show for it, so you could save me dozens of more hours repeating the same events.
---
Doing those too
---
With the addition of Survival mode, a single weekly challenge has been added (should be one for the next 6 weeks also) that reward a named legendary. Nothing super spectacular, unless your build calls for it, but i just personally like collecting stuff like that. Only reason i gave Survival a whirl tbh.
---
This weeks is called 'Crushing Blow'. Challenge ends with the rest of the weeklys. 
---
Also, you should keep an eye on dailys and weeklys, some are super easy and not so grindy, so it may be right up your alley to collect those few extra atoms.
---
Yeah, but people like to get as many atoms as they can and when challenges are dumb like that they can't.
---
All I get is Old Possum. Have 3 now. Anyone on PC want to trade?
---
I may have run into you yesterday (on PC?)...I only took the .38 shells as I was not sure what was being given...thank you! I was out of those shells for my pipe pistol...and right now I am a terrible shot...so those shells are a security blanket for me right now.
---
Whoa, we got a mirror boy here.
---
You are the one who stuck your nose into a discussion expressing an unpopular opinion, shoving your politics (e.g "not this whiteknight shit").  You are also the one who changed the subject (calling it whiteknighting).
---
So yeah... it's irritating, and why do you do it?  Great questions to ask yourself first.
---
Why did I object?  Because we like the game, and it gets tedious when people start dumping on stuff that people like because it makes them feel big.
---
Constructive criticism is cool, there's definitely things I would like to see too.  But over the top hating on it could kill it.
---
So... people like it, especially now.  What exactly is gained by pissing all over that?  You get to see the game shut down and ruin other people's fun?  Feels good man?
---
I honestly don't get it.  Someone likes something, good for them.  I go take a dump on it, then I'm the asshole.
---
If you are on PS4 I'll buy that from you lol
---
My resist is ~350. My % damage mitigation is over 100% (max value is capped to 95%) 
---
Without % mitigation, youd need over 1 million armor to get damage as low as mine. (Ill run the actual number when I get home from work)
---
Wasn't exactly comparing the two, just sarcastically agreeing. I think if the alcohol is a problem they should either not do the quests or play a different game. Alcohol had always been in Fallout and I see no reason to remove it now unless we want to slide down that slippery slope of "this offends me, remove it". Then before you know it we're all playing pong again. 
---
They aren't in game yet. You just saw an outfit 
---
All I know is the vault raids or whatever come when Nucleaur Winter update comes I'd guess. All I can say is if I run a raid and get nothing new but the same stuff we already get as drops, I'm probably gonna skip them altogether. Just my opinion though. Don't want to do something that could take who knows how long to finish for some generic 1* stuff. 
---
wait till you discover mods for your power armor.  calibrated shocks on the legs add a lot to your carry weight, for instance!
---
:)
---
Not sure exactly what you mean by that, but 2 days ago I went into edit mode, picked up my camp model and moved it a few feet inside a building. Just moved it within the current bounds of my camp. That's all. Not an actual camp move by going into PipBoy and doing the 'move camp' option. 
---
Maybe you should take up golf?!. Most golfers I've encountered are assholes. You seem to have that covered. You'd be a natural! üëç
---
It was probally the union uniform i dont think they are out yet
---
Damn, ready for war and angry about it 
---
To do new alt everytime it pops up?
---
Yesterday i did them all, only killing rabit while drunk wia specific alcohol, by the time i got that happy hopper i was too tired to server hop 10times till rabit spawns on random spawn.
---
The player probably went into the developer room and got one. The update comes out during the Pioneer update which is in May or late April.
---
Use it, sell it to players, or just toss it.
---
My assaultron helmet is nice, but it opens when in battle and then won't ever shut. I have to take it off and put it back on. Am I wearing it wrong?
---
Happens all the time to me I just don‚Äôt care, doesn‚Äôt effect anything.
---
Pretty sure they are not available yet, you probably saw a union soldier outfit. I have one and it has a backpack that's non functional. Could be wrong though, it happens a lot.
---
If you are on xbox find steelsight.  I have like 6 sitting in my stash....weight I'll sell them for 50 caps when the vending machines come out.
---
Dammit I fell for it. Lost 500 atoms lol
---
You can pick up the camp node thing and move it around even though your camp is built. I think that‚Äôs what he was talking about. 
---
So does the harder to detect while sneaking have any effect on players being able to see you or is that just for PVE?
---
Yeah and I hope these are gonna be challenging tasks as well and also have the chance to get special loot just from doing those raids
---
RIGHT!!!! Had a 3star super mutant suicider disappear last night, I don‚Äôt know what he dropped but it looked like combat armor, I read combat and gone... poof... so it was either some super cool combat armor or the legendary combat wombat. Either way I was disappointed 
---
2 separate accounts. A copy on each.
---
The trapper chest piece has a visible backpack on it.  It‚Äôs not functional though. 
---
Is that a power armor glowing eyes mod? Looks like it uses the eyes for the headlamp.
---
If this exists, I must know what it is.
---
You probably saw someone with the traveler's leather coat it just has a cosmetic pack, though I as well am looking forward to the release of backpacks.
---
eat me you digital gonorrhea. 
---
Drinking alcohol to escape your problems? There's a novel idea. It's funny that it's actually a viable concept in the game.
---
It‚Äôs not a bloody mess mechanic, I don‚Äôt have the perk, bodies literally go into a file marked fuck this player in particular.
---
The change you made probably triggered the proximity detection system, I'm guessing. After the update I had to move my base probably a half dozen times because of that, but I think I'm finally safe now.
---
Gotta work. Sorry
---
I've had this happen on several games for XBox1. 
---
Wow I never Knew that! I thought it just increases the time before you have to fix it again
---
&gt; They said it‚Äôs the biggest most ambitious update as well. 
---
good god man, it's PR speak. What do you think they're going to say, 
---
"we give it a decent amount of effort, I guess. try it out and see if you agree"?
---
Is it underarmor?
---
Its what I'm hoping for, special loot for doing something that no doubt will be challenging, but if its generic stuff, god I'll take a hard pass lol 
---
People were melting down the day the game was announced; dont conflate the unreasonable hate as reasonable merely because one of their reasons was sound. 
---
Is the ripper even usable? I have had two legendary ones and they literally do no damage, even though they‚Äôre ‚Äúv fast!‚Äù . Honestly I used them on a low ghoul and it basically laughed at me after I laughed at myself. 
---
You would see them while just exploring the world, naturally, organically. Perhaps include a beacon mode on pipboy to broadcast your position as an opt-in, and a beacon item you can erect at your camp if you're setting up a store or tavern or something, and are inviting customers.
---
I dont go around shooting at level 15s so thats not really the case.. and when im in adventure mode I dont shoot at anyone at all. 
---
This is an excellent question for which I don't have the answer yet but we were already planning to spent the evening researching this particular thing. My current bet is they do work in PvP.
---
Thanks, but I'm too busy at work.  Maybe they should just pay me so I can quit my job and start practicing.
---
I have a toon with about 500 unique plans of the 1300 available in-game. You can browse that list and get an idea of some of the plans you know and don't. My goal is to get all 1300 unique plans on it so you can browse and see what you are missing. IGN: jchamlin
---
Hmmm I've never had it happen before. Thankfully it did not have to redownload it found all the files, but still pretty annoying.
---
You sound like a real douche bag, I‚Äôd feel dirty being on the same server as you and would have to take a shower ü§¢
---
I've been wearing full heavy, studded leather limbs, a heavy combat chest, over the vault suit.  Campaign hat and patrolman sunglasses for looks.  I like the look and what most people don't know is that the heavy leather armor has better DR than heavy combat armor.
---
By the way -- all the online resources I've found for FO76 armor are, to put it mildly, shit.
---
5000 caps 
---
That's a long list? Have you played very many RPGs before?
---
10 rads is 1% HP i think ? So it's sorta 12.5% health, regardless of hits number.
---
don't take that as gospel, but i think thats how it works.
---
Hey man, did you see they mentioned you on the pax Panel??  Awesome!!
---

---
I saw somewhere that someone said that more chameleon effects equipped makes the distortion not quite as noticeable but I'm not too sure about it.
---
The syrynger is such an overlooked weapon. Tons of potential, but no love at all from devs.
---
Yes, that's all I've done.
---
I'm not trying to judge this thing BTW, just providing an easy way to complete it. I mostly ignore challenges anyway, I set my own :p
---
Thank u
---
hollow bolt. -bleed for added damage over 10 seconds or the like.
---
I don't think you need any practice being an asshole... 
---
I get what you are saying, but I go and explore any area I haven't regardless of enemy level. I am in the 150s, level wise, and like you said, it gets boring being stuck on the right side of the map. I was so focused on farming legendary gear that I forgot the thing I love most about fallout, the exploring. So I say take an hour or so to just explore, no matter what the enemy level is.
---
The problem with that is I didnt have it happen to me and start doing if to other people. I made a new character and didnt put points into things that werent dps/ dmg resist related so that when it did happen again I could win. Im not searching the map for level 20s to pick on. Lol. 
---
You use to be able to fast travel to anyone on your friends list with out them being in a team. they nerfed that so it would have worked with just your friends list.
---
team mates already have access to camp stuff. so technically all of this was already in place. 
---
Teams, that's the winning set up, your going to lose no matter how effective your weapon or armor is against 2-5+ foes at once 
---
What's strange is there aren't any off limits places anywhere near my camp. I can go place my camp exactly where it was before and in the surrounding areas.
---
This I'd rather doubt, but what I can attest to you by how I lost all my caps and aid is that there are sneak related benefits that are applicable even if you are not invisible at all.
---
But if you scrap a gun... forget about it. On Xbox at least, if you're scrapping from the Scrap Items section of a workbench as opposed to Craft/Modify Repair, it doesn't consistently scrap in order. So if you've got a weapon you want to keep in the middle of a bunch of other ones it will randomly jump up or down an item and skip one, scrapping the one you want to keep instead of the others. I've scrapped two Tesla weapons that way... super annoying. Favoriting an item should at LEAST make it ask if you're super duper sure you want to scrap it so you at least have to jump through another hoop to be safe. Just my two cents.
---
It's typically fanboying from OP, "everyone who criticized the game is a h8er!11!"
---
Alright keep avoiding the question. Le epic troll btw
---
Never played, how does that work?
---
only 4 known, and they range from useless to almost useless. Got a list of the ones you found? 
---
Xbox
---
People who dump their caps are the douchebags lol. I just want to play the game pvp how Beth wants and most people on here are just bad and become an echo chamber of saltiness when one person speaks up. 
---
Okay that sounds similar to what I've heard before.  My main is a melee build (level 197 now) and I was thinking of taking the perk for rads on melee hit but they told me it would only be like 5 hp loss for the 50 rads.   I also have a heavy Gunner at level 80 or so but it's turned into a muel for aid items lol, so now I'm making a third guy to be a vats crit build but I'm curious to try rads damage now.  It's only level 30 now so I'll have to grind a bit before I can try it out.
---
Level 5 gunsmith is what u want. 
---
Such as?
---
I agree wholeheartedly, I love the crossbow and primarily use it for hunting in the Forrest area when I‚Äôm low on food. I would love to be able to use it in places like the Mire for hunting or just have it as a more reliable weapon. 
---
That's alot of ellipses for someone with perfect grammar.
---
Hmm. Hallucinogen grenade bolt. Slightly damage a group, and they all turn on each other.
---
Read what you wrote.
---
Sling/crossbow combination. Reduced range/accuracy, but you use grenades as your ammo. (whatever is in your grenade slot)
---
My two shot plasma consumes exponential amounts of ammo with each pull of the trigger. I wonder if they patched that
---
I got that lol hate to think how long it would last if I didn‚Äôt.
---
Why are you so against criticizing the game?
---
Must be the first option
---
Probably not.  Spent 13 years in the military as a gay man during don't ask don't tell.  I'm quite angry all the time now a days :) lol
---
The option popped up for me too without paying for it so I went with it. I hope it holds.
---
Very immersive!
---
Old camp looks great! New camp....uhh..old camp looks great!
---
So when is new season you need to create new character, there are some challenges, that gives you cosmetic items when you do it, then season ends and start new one where you need to make new character again.
---
Thank you for communicating our "burning" desires!
---
I'll let your parents play the song at your funeral RIP WolfeBane
---
 I'm on PC, if you're still available to craft the Raider Shielded. I've been farming for months and have nothing to show for it, so you could save me dozens of more hours repeating the same events. 
---
Jesus I don‚Äôt know than man. Weapon artisan is only for crafting so don‚Äôt run that all the time. Gunsmith Level 5 is all you really can do to maximize the life of your weapon. 
---
Two shot isn't the greatest for non- automatic rifles. You'll want Bloodied or Instigating for a lever action. Also the level action really shines for stealth, explosive really messes that up.
---
Dump caps where, to a mule?
---
Man I want chrome for the submachine gun. Silver Shroud demands it!
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre asking but unyielding is one of a kind. And depends on your health being low. 
---
Man im not sure I can keep making new characters, its just time  consuming.
---
after you get the legendary you want, then what?
---
You seem a little short sighted to me. You need to slow down and smell the mutfruit.
---
Haha, I saw that. It was awesome!
---
Unyielding is the only one that boosts multiple stats. Its unique.
---
Yeah, I got a 3* bloodied lever too but I got tired of running bloodied all the time. Maybe I‚Äôll try trade it for an instigating.
---
same here, its not ideal
---
At least you admit it üëç just try chill, as frustrated as we all are trying to get those damn legendary's. It is only a game ü§ò
---
Tells us more about your love life than we want to know.
---
Thanks man. üëç
---
It wasnt entirely serious. You dont get xp from killing people so Id never level. 
---
I love revolvers and absolutely hate the spin up. It's only like a second or two at max, bit those seconds count in a sudden gun battle.
---
https://i.imgur.com/gOKVlTA.mp4
---
I really miss Three Dog. 
---
If you get unyielding sentinel with ap refresh which is rare af. You can put dodgy on and be pretty well invincible 
---
That's was what killed mass effect andromeda for me,  the rng pool table was soooooooo diluted that out was not fun to grind. 
---
I moved on. 
---
Yes. If you haven‚Äôt experienced it I see why u think I‚Äôm the douche
---
You only need the things you don't have.
---
But, seriously, only keep junk, and only broken down into components.
---
Yeah man just drop me a message when you‚Äôre online 
---
That‚Äôs how it works, should raise the bounty for shooting secured buildings twice-fold, but still would be a nice addition to the workshop
---
TSE is great for non vats/ heavy weapons users.
---
Vats is better with Anti-armor explosive or instigating explosive, maybe bloodied too.
---
I'm very glad you said human npc's and not just npc's. people have been redefining the term since this game launched. The game does in fact have non players characters. They are not human , but they are npc's. lazy npc's that don't offer any options at all in any way . But for the sake of clear communication, thank you
---
I think the x-01 just does that when you have it's headlamp on
---
there was a guy here about a week ago that thought that was the only way to put it on. Was angry that sometimes other people take it, and wanted bethesda to fix this.
---
I use survival to finish events. More xp. Other than that meh. Love regular play.
---
Desperately needed.
---
The only endgame content is kill queen, run whitesprings resort/westtek/watoga. And its gotten old AF.
---
I can just see explaining to my wife why I bought 2 PS4s (and two PSN accounts) just to move stuff between two copies of myself.
---
Hell yeah, that's been my standard outfit for like 20 levels now
---
thats what the fbi asked
---
When you are scrapping and accidentally scrap the power armor, that is what it looks like happens. You can't see individual parts, just the frame. Its gone, poof. No more.
---
and you shit yourself. Next time you load inventory, armor pieces are there, and you feel relief.
---
Other players *might* want it, so if you find yourself at a train station or similar place with ammo you don't want drop it in a container.  But never put ammo in your stash.
---
25 in one day ? Pretty hardcore 
---
Eve-online corporations, items and money shared between your corp members, characters or friends.
---
you failed to read the post. PvP server, people love to gank you while you trade or craft and can't fight back. So you go fast.
---
Nuclear bombs are all over West Virginia.  Big ones, little ones...
---
It is also for repairing 
---
Thank you for testing this and putting the video together.  I had came to the same conclusion regarding my chameleon armor after a teammate said they could still see me while crouched unless I unequipped then re-equipped just my chameleon piece; but I had thought it was a "maybe it's just me?" thing until seeing this post.  This somehow smells like another coding shortcut that Bethesda took much like how FPS is linked to game speed.
---
BTW had fun exchanging kills around Flatwoods Sunday with your crew.  :)  Tried saying thanks for the post in area chat but wasn't sure if you guys had left the area.
---
I main a tse lever action, try three ranks of luck of the draw in the luck category. Whenever you shoot there is a chance that the weapon greatly repairs itself
---
&gt;Now that we know the game sold ‚Äúvery very well‚Äù
---
Except it didn't. 
---
https://www.unilad.co.uk/gaming/fallout-76-sales-down-82-percent-from-fallout-4/

and worldwide...

https://twitter.com/_SuperData/status/1075843291927773184
---
Cool. I don't like the look of X-01 so I never built that. Guess I need to make a helmet. Never noticed this before.
---
&gt; Maybe throw away junk you have over 300.
---
Or bulk it and sell it to vendors.
---
But sometimes it just isn't worth the plastic to bulk it.  Must find more plastic...
---
Imagine your health being high and something that‚Äôs slightly different than unyielding, what would be the closest thing? Something that doesn‚Äôt increase special.
---
Yeah i found tons of acid quickly from acid deposits, chemical junks and yaoguais I killed. It‚Äôs a little bit easier than lead I think. 
---
Ok point taken, I think there should be a cap minimum to enter the survival arena to make PVP worth bothering with if caps are the only reward, plus the aid items.
---
i know it dont look super great. It's more of a technelogical feat. It's 100% floating. Not connected to anything. No 1 foundation and starts like most people say is a floating base.
---
My next camp is going to be better though. Im going to build a ship port on a clif side. 2 100% floating ships, and try for a small walled community.
---
Thank you! MintoXEdge and im loggin in rn!!!!

Let me guess, the one with +1 perception? Had the same problem.

I have an adrenal reaction serum sitting in my stash I can sell, or I would be willing to trade it for healing factor serum?

Thanks man I will definitely try that.

April fools lmao
---
Hey, there's a settlement under attack,  follow me!
---
Just when you thought you shook him. ‚ÄúA settlement needs our help‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt understand? I have 15 perception, it‚Äôs a sniper build.
---
*next week
---
Maybe the person who got you when you were lvl 15 only did it because somebody else got *them* when *they* were just starting out. Would that make it okay then?? All you're doing is perpetuating behavior that you hate. The very definition of a hypocrite. I really don't care what you do or why, I was just pointing out that if you want to end the chain of bad behavior, it can only start with you. Personally, I save ammo, plans, and recipes I don't need in order to give them to low-level players. You see, we're *both* making a difference in someone's gaming experience, you need to decide what that difference is.
---
It depends on how you use it 
---
You toke my hopes put them and a ball. and then you killed them. Happy April fools everyone.
---
Only other thing you could do is throw 3 points into luck of the draw and that should help. 
---
What? No My bad, maybe I worded it wrong, I don‚Äôt want anything for free, I could buy shit but people wouldn‚Äôt even give me chance. But as a side note, it takes nothing for me to make a level 5 or 10 lever so why not just give one away instead of a boiled water. I myself am going to do this once a session basically that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying
---
Oh I understand, sorry lol yes 
---
Vanguard gives 35dr/er per piece. DR is pretty meh though. Vs 100 incoming damage the diff between 200 dr &amp; 500dr is less than 10 damage.
---
You may be talking Vanguards. It give up to 35 energy and damage resistance at full health 
---
Not usually but it is a rifle and so benefits from tank killer and the increased stagger chance, which will negate sentinel.
---
I've had several lever actions, and that one breaks so much faster than the others. 
---
If you can get used to seeing the distorted outline it becomes pretty easy to spot other players using stealth boys or chameleon.  Ever see the Predator movies?  It's the same kind of shimmer.  Sunday I was counter-sniping just from seeing their shimmering outlines, didn't even need to waste my mentats.
---
Exactly. Aid items are cheap tho. My hope is that after the beta, Beth will make a (ranked, try hard, pvp, whatever you wanna call it) geared server in addition to survival. I know that‚Äôs prob gonna be a bitch for them cause they‚Äôre new to online fallout if It‚Äôs even possible. They will probably make some small changes instead to make it more feasible in the same server.
---
A lot fewer asshats trying to ruin your day. Thats a nice benefit.  
---
there will always be asshats. Reducing the asshat-per-hour ratio is always good.
---
My mister handy buzz blade would like to have a word. 
---
This doesn‚Äôt work with lever action well. It still breaks. I have this gun too and it‚Äôs the only one out of 20 I have that break. 
---
I had this happen yesterday with a ton of aid, mats and flux. No weapons thankfully. 
---
Thanks, i‚Äôm Interested I vanguard now!
---
No love for the eyebot helmet?  Personally I love running around with what looks like a Sputnik satellite on my head. 
---
If anyone on Xbox needs a assaultron helmet give Elvis Anger a yell. I‚Äôve got a couple extra in my stash you can have for free. 
---
Vanguard it is!
---
No but seriously human-like NPCs with dialogue like even ESO would be very welcomed.
---
Now thats funny.
---
I get all mine when just hitting runs on whitespring and selling. A few magnifying glasses, some fancy cups / decanter / pitcher things.
---
Guess it‚Äôs time to get a new gun. Handmade is badass 
---
This is incorrect. Each minute in game is 3 seconds. 
---
The easiest way to fix crossbows? Make them like Skyrim bows. Crossbow keeps its damage and effects, but you can craft and select bolts/arrows to feed it. 
---
Wood+Steel = Bolt
---
Wood+Steel+Circuit = Troubleshooter bolt
---
Wood+Steel+Lead = Heavy bolt
---
Wood+Steel+Acid = Poison bolt
---
Fiberglass+Steel = Lightweight bolt (hitscan speed)
---
Fiberglass+Glass = Bleed bolt
---
Fiberglass+Bone = Disease bolt
---
These are just examples, but you get the idea. While it is in need of a damage and armor penetration boost, adding only that isn't doing them justice. The weapon needs its own philosophy of use.
---
Yes lol
---
It‚Äôs wrong. 
---
Yeah, but do you know many coding bugs that would bring in?
---
That might have been why, moving the node changes your spawn local and if it can‚Äôt spawn you properly it breaks your camp 
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
It's still in the top 20 which isn't bad at all after the messy launch
---
My fault. I misunderstood. 
---
My album is also full. Been trying to decide how best to share it.
---
You killed the enemy spawns too quickly. Quest scripts suck and if you do something that messes with each stage of the event then you can break something.
---
In this case when the heart starts to close just stop what you're doing an wait until it has gone immortal and it's health disappears. Then clear the adds. 
---
At later levels I‚Äôd have thought caps are kind of pointless though, we are all drowning in those god damn bottle tops do easy to accrue and it‚Äôs the fight that is the point. 
---
Anyway, will be interesting to see how survival mode changes over the coming weeks and months.
---
It glitched the other day for myself and another player as well. We got the first few waves, but not the last wave. The flower also was not shown as an enemy, but as tamed or safe (white bar instead of red bar).
---
I did see the event pop up again and went and tried to do it myself and noped the heck out of there for the third wave, which was a 3 star legendary mireluk queen who absolutely destroyed me and killed me incredibly fast (in t-60 power armor). I think I died twice, respawned and tried to take pot shots, but was minimal damage. I'm a level 90 melee, with some heavy guns that I use for SBQ fights.
---
TL;DR: Glitched on wave 3 for me, flower shows as friendly; legendary mireluk queen is a beast, do this as a group/team.
---
I main my quad crossbow. It has perfect VATS rolls. Still takes 5 shots to down someone in PA though.
---
I had a spot like that, but after the last big patch it was no longer placeable. I keep looking to see what they are going to put there, but nothing shows up yet.
---
VATS makes any of the secondary shots go widely off mark, try using Iron sights/scopes second shot should be more accurate.
---
Yeah these challenges are definitely not geared toward people who have busy schedules. I figured they really exist to keep the people busy who have done absolutely everything there is to do in the game.
---
1 hour in game is 3 min IRL. 12 hours is 36 min IRL. It takes 72 IRL minutes for a day to pass in 76
---
Thanks! Will try again!
---
my camp is a bar and so my vending machine will be all booze. Already  have 25 nukashine, 15 tick blood teuilas, 20, nukadarks and 10+ of every beer/mixed drink made. I enjoy making them and have like no stash space, so I'll offer everything for cheap
---
Sounds fun! I would love to find out that these Heart things are related to that interloper in the lucky hole mine
---
They... don't?
---
Not everything is for everybody, man. 
---
Step back. Take a breath. 
---
He will mark your map, even if he has to cross time and space to do it.
---
Is this for ps4 because I‚Äôll buy
---
Because maybe it will be good again?
---
I use a combo on Vanguards (+dmg/energy resits higher the health), Bolstering (+3 all stats when low health) and Unyielding (+Dmg/energy resist lower health). It's a full health PvE shotgun build, and I have mainly instigating weapons. I had full Vanguards at one point and my dmg/energy resist was great, but after 2 or 3 hits it's like it doesn't even exist. I recommend a combo of these armors. Even if you're not bloodied, the hits that count are when you're low on health.
---
Also, I'm concerned about the level action rifle. After reloading and cocking the rifle, it ejects a spent shell casing? But I already ejected the spent shell casing after firing my last shot... spooky
---
That would be cool even if it's just a for fun weapon like the chainsaw or energy guns. I'm pretty sure I saw one on a wall too. I spent a minute or two making sure it wasn't loot able. So there's already a model for it at least. Maybe just make it an axe skin
---
you on Ps4, id be down to trade/buy it to test it out on my rifle character
---
If you have atom shop paints put em on, next patch comes with ability to name so it will help some.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Just about every enemy with a gun drops something else. Scorched are the biggest culprits. 
---
is this true? I always focus my armor on high DR, and don't really pay much attn to energy cause I figure most things I fight are melee. How could DR do so little?
---
Just store the wall next to get to get instead of deleting the door, so you dont have to change the code
---
But you can‚Äôt scrap ammo.
---
Nah
---
Ya.  I found a deep Pocketed chest plan as a random spawn in the church at Harpers Ferry.  
---
I wish areas were more exclusive on their available item pools.  And why is Camp Venture, one of the BOS training grounds, filled with plans and mods for Robot Armor and Marine Armor instead of Combat Armor and Marine Armor?
---
There should be more level and area theme restricted pools of plans and items around Appalachia.  I should be finding plans for the Single Action Ivory Pistol Grip spawn in Camp Venture.  (Which happens all the time)
---
The new off-limit build territory restrictions are unclear at the moment. I spent an hour or so on a new Camp in Toxic Valley which when I logged back in got removed. Wish I had been told up front. Lesson learned, I‚Äôll place my camp then re-log back in to double check. 
---
Only I did this, on my new camp much farther away, and it kicked me off even after reloading in successfully a few times. 
---
Its not ideal. :/
---
Since Day 1. 
---
I‚Äôm gona try the luck of the draw, but if it doesn‚Äôt get better I will hit u up. 
---
This is why with anything I'd be upset about losing, I use the trade menu.  Its cludgey, but you won't lose your stuff.  At least I'm pretty sure you won't.  
---
140 hours in and need to slow down?  okay. sure.
---
If you go into edit mode and you make a doorway into a wall ( replace option ), you can enter your camp and connect everything back .  No need for new code
---
A lot of the stuff scales based on the player that goes there and initiates the spawns.
---
No problem!
---
Customisable backpack system comes May 7th. According to the official Wild Appalachia graphic released to social media :) 
---
That's because the bounty in Survival is for revenge, not to act as punishment as it does on adventure mode.  There is really no "offender" in a game mode where anything goes.
---
Best Ever!

&gt;	Nuka Quantum x01 with Owl mask
---
Unpainted X-01 with Owl Mask for me. I have the paint, but I find the matching greys pleasing. 
---
No joke, I did nothing but grind the Fasnacht event for a couple days and almost every legendary I got was a wood arm or leg or some useless underpowered melee weapon. 
---
r/suspiciousquotes
---
Fallout NV had the Mojave Express boxes you could transfer stuff with.
---
There's always a rabbit at the Whitesprings Bunker Service Entrance. Check the woods behind the entrance building.
---
i played since beta. I like to build camps. My build is melee and power armor. I only use that when a strong enemy appears. I normally dont use power armor now. I also dont use my best weapons.
---
I scavenge for supplies to build. Like copper or concrete.
---
I have an explosive flamer, it's pretty narley and dangerous 
---
I completely agree and I‚Äôve had that issue also. But instead of scrapping I sold my favorite Lever Action to a vendor bot. I was able to buy it back but between that. Naming will help at least, but I‚Äôd love some way to favorite certain pieces. 
---
Hmm, too bad.
---
Will be worth a lot. I sold something similar for around 10k caps.
---
I would find a player to get them from for a couple thousand or whatever instead of dropping that much at the vendor. 
---
If you are using an explosive weapon to kill something. The last hit will send them flying. And if it's not in the same direction as whoever's got the last hit, well the pile appears where they "see" it.
---
I did that and uranium fever.  Problem is assholes just camp it, good news about the events is you can't kill each other... bad news is... right after the event you can...
---
I'm pretty sure that animation used to be in the game, but it was removed early on because it was causing or thought to be causing some other issues.
---
YEAH! last night i waited and waited, left and came back to whitesprings after a nuke, after clearing the initial set of glowing ones they never respawned , i was confused and bummed
---
With server instability making a comeback the paperbag - which I must say worked pretty well between patch 6 and 7 - is currently relegated to 'stuff I can farm again'.
---
Clunky as it may be legendaries and other harder to replace stuff is trade menu only.
---
I actually lost a pile of aid items to a sever 'crash' this weekend; luckily it wasn't anything that Pharma Farma and time could not replace.
---
List ALL mods like camp.. then allow us to craft them as we unlock them. I shouldn‚Äôt have to google what mods are available and cross check it against what mods I know vs what I still need to learn for every weapon. Or to find out the weapon I want to mod doesn‚Äôt have any
---
r/market76 could probably get one on there for 1.5-2k 
---
No I worded it bad, both times really. I forgot what it was like to be level 5 and how nice a hunting rifle with stock and barrel was! Lol 
---
Yup body guards on charisma stranger in numbers etc 
---
Just don't do it by the junk truck. I needs my civil war reenactor spawns.
---
I don't even level up once on a regular session, much less three times.  Please Bethesda, don't go trying to restrict our influx of Atoms with nigh impossible challenges.
---
hahaha welcome to inventory management simulator 76 my friend
---
If you're on xbone I can craft you one
---
Yea but if you want a vanguard combat or marine armor set stout talking 30k+
---
Haha that‚Äôs my secret! She had her own PS4 and own copy of fallout76! 
---
GET IT OUT GET IT OUT!!!! Where's my legendary drill to make it go away!
---
I have some gog axes I can repair and some I can't. Very strange
---
Every time i go to the high school in Watoga since the last patch it's always infested with like 50 high-level super mutants in addition to the ghouls normally there. It's ridiculous and has completely killed my plastic farming in that area. 
---
explain after a nice dinner and a movie, quietly, right before she falls asleep
---
What are your thoughts about life saving sent? 
---
Only vats headshots crit ignore sentinel effect or any vats crit including NON limp focused attack (as if you dont have concentrated fire perk)?
---
I am on market 76 trading this on PC

---
They actually do some pretty decent damage. I've been running around with one on onrnof my chars and it's a pretty fun weapon. Ran around Fasnacht melting stuff and heard someone over the mic go 'holy shit what weapon is that?!' Plasmas are kind of a rare sight though.
---
There's always mine.
---
Yeah, when vending comes you will have something to do with all those caps, so it might not be such a big issue then.
---
Bolstering gives you the same but when your health is low
---
I think they just said starred legendaries now guarantee a legendary drop because in the past you could kill one and they wouldn‚Äôt drop any legendary at all 
---
I got the chest plans from dropping data in the box
---
I think I have one piece of that. But ive out levelled it
---
When he is level 1, have him server jump at vault 76 for 10-20 min, and hang out for about 2 min in each server, tell him why...
---
Because people like me, any time I see a level 1 at the vault, I fast travel and dump plans, aid items, ammo onto them. 
---
It will introduce him to the friendlier side of the multiplayer, and give him a solid start on plans and supplies.
---
I saw one on my vendor run today but can‚Äôt remember which it was, wouldn‚Äôt have been whitesprings station or Enclave bunker so would have been either Camden park (unlikely), Sutton station, Harper‚Äôs ferry, Watoga plaza or Watoga station, I originally purchased mine at Watoga station so my money would be trying there first and if not try  the plaza or Harper‚Äôs ferry, sorry I can‚Äôt be more precise
---
Yeah, pretty much this exactly.
---
It would be great if it was used that way, but it would sadly be misused and would end up looking like a graffiti covered, junior high toilet stall
---
I like it!!!
---
Nice!
---
In my experience two shot launchers are still very effective. Though their durability goes very fast with the two shot effect. 
---
Are you threatening me Master Jedi
---
"Hey you, you're finally awake!"
---
Maybe the sound of your footsteps and jumping noises?
---
What settings did you use for the screenshot. It looks really nice! 
---
Yea, its still RNG to find a 3\*, then RNG to see whether it will drop a 1/2/3\*, then RNG to see if it's a weapon/armor, then RNG to see what kind.. fun fun!
---
I killed 3 different 3\*s over the weekend, which all dropped a form of 1\* garbage armor.
---
I've heard the best non legendary armor is Heavy BoS Combat Armor.
---
Perfect!
---
Ug, but empath and herd mentality are such a pain. 
---
They are probably more mature than some of the player base. 
---
To be fair, ESO didn't get to where it is in its first year either.  But more events is always good.  Look at Pokemon Go.  They realized that adding new generation of pokemon once a year wasn't cutting it.  Now they have community days once a month and weekly events on a regular basis, in addition to holiday themed events, and that was before they added friendships, trading and PVP.
---
I see, thanks! I'll definitely keep the recipe in mind if I need adhesive!
---
Also, that's great to know about Power Armour! I found two frames while playing last time. One had 2 T60 pieces which were level 40 so I scrapped it. I also found an entire Raider set, but I sold all the pieces as I could not fit it in my storage either. Might be a mistake as I did not realize the weight would actually be taken away when on the frame, but I'm not high enough level (close though).
---
at least my words make sense
---
Gotcha. I've heard that West-Tek is a good spot for legendaries but I've not had that great luck with it myself, so your mileage may vary. It's also pretty heavily farmed, so there's that.
---
They're less common than they used to be, but a circuit or two of Watoga may turn up a legendary protectron or two. 
---
The General's Steakhouse may be worth a visit, I remember there being a ton of super mutants and at least one starred in there. 
---
Doing the horde events may also turn up some stars, pretty sure I've seen one each time I've done one (though I've only done three, so it's a small sample size.)
---
I wish you luck in your mission!
---
Damn autocorrect. LMAO 
---
Have you had any luck getting the top hat? 
---
I think they appear in some of the raider vendors.  Pretty sure I bought mine from Sutton. 
---
12000 with no perks and 3 Charisma.  9800 with hard bargain 3, 9300 with grape mentats (pretty sure).
---
Another player would be a cheaper option.  
---
I felt the same way when I found a bloodied fat man. 
---
My kingdom for a executioners lever action, but I might tweak my build for a while and try this bad boy out lol.
---
Lol wtf are you talking about ‚Äúsince it‚Äôs multiplayer?‚Äù All 3 points were good and agreeable fast travel needs to go. The caps don‚Äôt go magically into a pool that someone can be rewards maybe like mr prize bot instead of a stupid prize he could reward us with a portion of that server‚Äôs fast travel cap pool Ike monopoly
---
You can get the heavy combat armor plans from a vendor can't remember where I got the deep pocketed from
---
Oh I'm so in. 
---
I would have just hard closed the game forget about quiting to menu. Fast fast exit
---
&gt;s
---
Hey, I was at your shop during Fasnacht! Really awesome job -- loved how you had customers approach the window. Very nicely done. 
---
We try to do it once a week, but it sort of depends on everyone's schedule aligning.
---
The problem with this is you originally said you're only killing people. Now we can see it's defensive but nothing about your original comment spoke to that at all. Lol. 
---
I think you are assuming Im just following people around slap damaging them... or over analyzing my statement. I shoukd have said I need to be able to kill people, not ONLY kill people. My buddy has a bounty room full of cardboard cutouts I destroy to get my bounty up and fight people who come after it. Its fun. I can also craft all the serums so I farm mats and I always drop them to low levels with mics and explain what they do. Youre reading too much into one comment. Although I actually like the pvp in this game. I dont go about instigating it like youre probably assuming. I only take a workshop if I actually plan on using it. But, that being said there is no right or wrong way to play. Its a multiplayer game in a nuclear apocalypse, you should have to worry about what other people are going to do. 
---
Sure
---
the listed damage is about 8 DMG. If you repair it to 200%, you can get about 30 DMG. (I am pulling these numbers off the top of my head, so please do not quote me). I believe this is the "glitch" part of the statement above.
---
I have used a chainsaw on a scorched beast and it was tearing it up. I could clearly see the health dropping quickly. I believe this is the "approximating the damage" part. The displayed damage seems to be different than the actual damage, so you will need to approximate the damage it will do.
---
worded differently, if you glitch it (repair it above 200%) into approximating the damaged (so it will do the appropriate damage) that it was intended to do.
---
I am not convinced that is true.  I have turned in 100s and recieved every single paint and shielded lining multiple times.  Never received any BOS or Deep Pocketed plans for Combat Armor.  Dozens of Legendary Combat Armor pieces.  
---
That would actually be awesome tho
---
That happened to me with the woodland paint on my t60. It was only for the right leg though.
---
OP did ask for the April **2018** code
---
Its completely random every time so the chances are pretty low
---
lat night o noticed on my level 16 in Whitesprings when i died to a mob, it wasnt showing the diamond where my loot was, so i figured someone took it after i died, i ran back to the location, but my bag was there! the game just wast showing me the on screen quest "pick up your loot bag"
---
strange...
---
I‚Äôve only seen them spawn randomly on mod locations and containers.  Never found a single guaranteed spot.
---
Picked up the only one since the vendor update in the mod spawn location in the church at Harpers Ferry. 
---
Thanks I just had a friend make me one! And a POS pipe rifle lol. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs crazy. So I‚Äôm just going to give someone a modded gun everytime I play (from my main)
---
quite the mental gymnastics required to make sense of this, right?  and repairing to 200% isn't a glitch, it's a mechanic, so his post makes even less sense now...
---
Yea thinking maybe I just have to scrap it to learn deep pocketed
---
Yeah thats fair enough. It was really just a joke because thats how ai felt when they shotgunned tf out of my first brahmin lol. I dont grief people but I love it when people start attacking my base. 
---
Depends on what you think was broken.  People sometimes use a few words when many more are needed.
---
I don't think it's changed all that much since release.  I never had most of the bugs that other people reported experiencing.  The biggest change IME is that they raised the stash limit (great thing), fixed the power armor bug (good fix) and nerfed the TSEs (I'm still miffed about it).  Server stability has improved, but IME it was never as bad as others were saying anyway.
---
If your issues with the game are more from a design/conceptual standpoint, then there really haven't been any significant changes.  It's still the same game.
---
It‚Äôs random but a small pool of available rewards.  (Outfits, Paints, Lining)  Until I see a screenshot of the plans dropping as a reward I won‚Äôt be convinced it‚Äôs possible.  Or some datamined reward list.  
---
Not sure if I‚Äôm having the same issue.  Had someone follow me back to my camp and was stealth sniping me, I was wanted at the time so I popped a Berry Mentat and searched  but could not locate him. I‚Äôm unsure if someone has found a way to avoid being picked up by Berry Mentats. Tho I was in a team at the time. 
---
I really like this idea. I want the lasers honestly to prevent none teammates from entering my command center. 
---
I loved lone wanderer in fallout 4.
---
You need to have weaponsmith rank 3(I think its called) to be able to repair it to 200% and it gets a huge damage boost. I have a level 40 and it does 60-70 damage at 200% repaired. It does that to all the v fast weapons. It's not like it's a super powerful weapon option but it is fun running through horses of ghouls and holding attack and just chopping them up.
---
Deep Pocketed and BOS cannot be learned by scrapping. 
---
I can see what you're saying. But I don't believe this game has a solid learning quest line for the newbies. After Flatwoods you're practically on your own with only main quest to follow.
---
I think it actually does, but the stat screen is misleading. Stat screen shows it doing 1 more damage than a normal one at the same level, but the actual explosion should be 20% stronger by comparison when you test them side by side against an enemy.
---
Logic behind this is I tested a 2 shot missile launcher vs an anti armor missile launcher, and the 2 shot took off more health compared to the anti armor one.
---
Two shot only shows a 1 damage improvement on the stat screen, which is the direct impact damage of the 2nd missile, but it appears the damage from the 2nd missile applies once you actually fire it. 
---
Tested against glowing snallygasters and super mutant warlords. Both had targeting computers to ensure direct hits.
---
I‚Äôve long since sold my Bunker Buster, but I‚Äôd bet you‚Äôd see a similar result compared to a non-legendary one. 
---
Why the stat screen works this way, is anyone‚Äôs guess...
---
This happens if you are over encumbered generally.
---
If you have weapon artisan at rank 3 where  you repair them to 200% they get a huge damage boost
---
That's what I was thinking. This needs to be explored further. It's surely an exploit if true...
---
A 3 starred Legendary only has a **chance** of dropping 3 starred loot. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Legendary enemies always dropping loot according to their amount if stars would imho break rng, as the chance of getting top tier equipment would rise to the point where it gets almost too easy.
---
I know, RNG can really be a b\*tch, but that's how it works.
---
Same shit happened to me. A bunch of baiters our there who can only get kills this way. 
---
Most veteran sent/as armor players are smart enough to use pneumatic torso (which reduces the effectiveness of tank killer) and adamantium skeleton (which eliminates any benefit from tormentor). They can help in some situations, don't get me wrong, but .... yeah.
---
"And I said...fuck this I'm respeccing and *only killing people.*" (emphasis is mine)    
---
    
---
Yes, I must be reading something into that which you didn't write.    
---
Like I said, do whatever the hell you want, but know that doing something that you don't want anyone doing to you makes you a hypocrite.    
---
Sometimes the only recourse against something or someone you don't like is to just forget it and move on with your life. Like I'm doing riiiggghht...now ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Then you don‚Äôt complete the challenges? 
---
Dude you have 3 kids and a full time job. The game‚Äôs more difficult challenges can not be designed to cater to you. 
---
I know that sucks but like, surely you can see that you just don‚Äôt have enough time for some of the supplementary content of a huge Online RPG.
---
I will say this...
---
Explosive flamers shoot at insane range and obliterate everything. They‚Äôre currently the best way to exterminate chameleon people right now. 
---
I‚Äôd dread a buff to the weapon unless they remove or tweak the explosive effect on it.
---
k! 
---
Almost got me there, Bethesda.
---
Your either trolling or you some how missed the 3 posts a day here about this armor. It's not as good as you think. The only people that think it's amazing are people with pve builds. Any and I mean any class with a pvp build tears through the stuff in 2 seconds. Save the 50k and spend the caps on a God roll weapon and unlimited stealth boys, make a pvp perk cards set and you will be better In pvp thst just about everyone wearing sent or cav.
---
FYI: Top 3's can still be hidden if they're sneaking. Wanted's can't. Also you generally want to avoid dying while overencumbered - that limits your fast travel on death options so you can't use it as an end run to get back to your CAMP.
---
I think I've got an anti armor plasma rifle, I'll check when I get home from work and let you know.
---
No yet. Have civil war dress, suit, and union suit so far.
---
Got mine at sunnytop a couple weeks ago.
---
Okay cool I appreciate it
---
Thanks for stopping by! Yeah I‚Äôm still tweaking the overall design, I‚Äôve more than doubled the display shelves and junk on those shelves in my new store ‚ÄúHog Heaven‚Äù. You‚Äôll have to check it out when I‚Äôm done. Also I‚Äôve been hunting plans like crazy and have some unique ones I‚Äôll still sell for cheap when I open (mirror ball, nuka quantum paint, fusion generators, etc.)
---
They would have to add a suicide button at the same time! He walks up and says his (shiver) line and all the players around drop dead to avoid him
---
Make sure you disable or update your Mods and/or Custom ini file.  It can cause problems with Atom Shop textures. 
---
Check for corrupted or missing files in your install as well. 
---
Are you sure super duper works that way with ammo? When super duper activates when I am using chemist, I only get 1 extra not 2.
---
Lol.. just curious, are you on PS4 ?   
---
I have a full sent/assassin set -- and had some fun with people trying to kill me last night as I just stood still.  
---
I'd like to see a Chewbacca gun variant and I wouldn't mind a grappling hook.  
---
Not trolling haven't paid a lot of attention to this sub in a week or two I was trying to get caught up on how the armor worked.
---
April fools! Good one Bethesda. 
---
Explosive flamers are currently quite broken.
---
It‚Äôs similar to the Explosive Auto laser/plasma shotgun.
---
One of the best unmarked plastic spots to add to your plastic farm runs. I go here after Morgan high
---
I think the 2 extra diamond spots are for a future update
---
This is good to know. I thought the map was bugged too. 
---
I would sign up for Instagram just for this! How do I find you?
---
I assure you there is a dupe method out there still. 99% of all weapons sold to other players right now are duped. 
---
which post, link plz. And all vats crit ignore sent/assass set effect or only limb focused crits, like headshots?
---
damn im sorry this happened, i guess next time just drop 1 item in the bag, then test if your friend can pick that up,before dumping the rest of your stuff
---
Ah. I do not have a Brahmin yet. Maybe I'd feel like swatting some players if they killed my cow too. As of now they come in and mess with my shit and I just stare at them like... So? I'm not going to hit you back dude. 
---
Coming 'summer'
---
Use a critical shot, but also, damage rounds down. You‚Äôre doing close to 100 in practice, without the sent/ass resistance.
---
Like I said man, its an exaggeration. Yes I like pvp, but that doesnt mean I want to fight people who dont want pvp... I also said I give low levels serums. But thank you for the generic life advice. Ill start practicing it right nowüëå

Nah but their heavy in stash :/

Pneumatic definitely helps with the stagger prevention... In those cases I just hope to try and catch them when they move, with my AA rifle/perks

I bought a TSE handmade for 3k and sold it for 29 :(

All crits.

Have to thank whoever left two legendaries in a cottage at whitesprings, cheers

Red Dead Online should have been the nail that sealed FO76‚Äôs coffin. 
---
They didn‚Äôt deliver *at all*. 
---
FO76 has steadily improved. 
---
Bethesda has great communication with their fans, a real, detailed, and exciting roadmap, micro-transactions that are easily grindable, they‚Äôre giving free DLC and updates. 
---
The game deserves success. I‚Äôm not jaded towards it because I wasn‚Äôt a launch player and came in after a lot of the bug fixes. I‚Äôve only seen it in a fairly good state. It‚Äôs damn fun though and shouldn‚Äôt be marred by its rough launch. 
---
Well!
---
They must have made changes in the last 2 updates/patches.
---
I started playing wanting a build based on shotguns...
---
So I hit "Uranium Fever" events when I noticed them.
---
   In the last 30 daysish. I have gotten 2 x Grognak, 3 diamond level 50 axes.
---
I also got 1 at level 40...
---
I have broken my axe and ran outta .45s. Picked up shells from them and shotguns. All level 50 so far...
---
I have gone from level 115 to level 145 in that time frame.
---
   Pleas don't ask me to take a video. I'm 60 and would need help with that! 
---
I can take a pic, and hope the background will show where I am.
---
I'm on PC. Still haven't gotten the gun I want. So I keep trying all events. Sad to say most events at same place gives same drops...
---
I've given away most of what I get to the overseers cache box. But have needed caps so I'm vendor hopping my nights away!
---
  They also nerfed my radium rifle. It's 30% less damaging.
---
Aaarrrgghhhh.

See I dont do that part. Thats not pvp. Thats just multiple people annoying someone. There are fb groups and ps4 communities for people who like pvp.

hhahahh good april 1st post m8
---
It's not weaker than 9 out of ten armors that you encounter.
---
Most non-power armor builds you encounter WILL NOT be sentinel assassins. I know because I easily destroy both PA and non- PA builds. 
---
In my experience, there's no armor keeps you alive very long if the player shooting you has the right weapons. It's simply a matter of who shoots first and who can do the  most damage first. 
---
Where is bubbles?
---
Yeap! Super duper is 30% chance to make another. So on a super duper craft with rank 2 ammosmith amounts 27 +27 = 54 Cryo Cells on your best craft roll
---
Yeah I have one too. It used to kill a lvl40 hulking mega sloth in 1 shot but now it doesn't. Haven't seen a bloodied one to compare it to yet. 
---
Yeah it's not fixed, died twice to it yesterday.
---
For me, weapon artisan maxed is better than both and you only need to use it when you are repairing your weapon ...
---
Yep.  This sucks,  Killed a legendary 3* deathclaw outside of Whitesprings and the damn thing disappeared.  Talk about a kick in the nuts. 
---
I tried it the other day and was repeatedly killed by spawn campers. In my case I was actually dead before I could move or see.  Not even sure how that's fun for the people doing it. Pretty lame experience.
---
Has anyone else ever found legendaries in trash cans at white spring or that just me haha
---
I've sold ultracite armor plans to low level players that requested them. I charged 50 caps a plan for each piece so 250 caps so they can build a set. Not sure if I was ripping them off or helping them out lol.
---
I disagree.p, and so does that constant pile of tech under me at login , plus all the garbage I‚Äôve received that, according to you, should‚Äôve been better   
---
I actually made it ;)
---
And who?
---
I feel u on this so much haha
---
The advice about having buyers join your server is solid, but if you are going to join someone else it's a good idea to keep your junk stashed until you can assess the situation. There are stash boxes everywhere, so there's no reason to pull out your junk (heh) until you know everything is on the up and up.
---
Demolition expert wasn‚Äôt designed primarily for guns - if you use grenades and mines it does what you are saying (60% full damage increase) ... since it is only a small portion of the damage on a legendary gun it makes sense it wouldn‚Äôt affect the overall damage of the gun ...
---
Scrap. Your. Junk. Don't store un-scrapped junk. 
---
Thank you Ladydevann and could you also look into Lock And Load not working with the beautiful Harpoon gun? It will only speed up the reload animation but you can‚Äôt fire the gun after reloading. It‚Äôs an obvious bug. 
---
Yeah i got spawned kill with no caps repeatedly 
---
Yeah that too....
---
I feel you sir! I don't know how much time I've spent hunting, but being uneducated on the places to go - Im only sitting at 7/25. And I've killed a lot of no-star legendaries. I was talking about it the other day and feel, even if they included the no-stars and increased the kill count to like, 40. I think it'd still be much easier than the current 1-star+ legendary challenge.

This is perfect for those Free Staters wanting to keep their ears warm in the Mire.

Block someone on that server and try again
---
Honestly we need a more stable source of plastic rather than farming the high school. For camp and bulking purposes the distribution is fine but when it comes to the rarer energy ammo it goes so quickly. 
---
always find squirrels there.
---
if that was the case, then it would be WAY too easy to farm legendary items.

oh that would be good,but I'm meaning this as well

You just gotta remind yourself. You cant have EVERYTHING in the game. This is just their way to hook the audience. You have to beat back the urges and accept what you can/can't do. Just have fun with it. The moment it stops being fun and feeling like a chore is never a good feeling.
---
Tl;dr You're taking a break until they release legendary vendor May 23rd.
---
Things have really changed around here haven't they lol
---
fyi, summoning someone doesn't work in the post, has to be in the comments iirc

From artisan's corner (main workshop area in Whitesprings), turn left  and go to the foyer, look to your right and go up the stairs, turn left and go up the hallway there to what looks like a ballroom/dance floor. Turn to your right and go into the room, Bubbles.
---
Once you find them,, leave by one of the doors there, and this will put you by the Putting green. Remember where the green is, and it's a lot easier to get to Bubbles from outside.
---
Happened to me on a no-star ordinary fat ghoul. No legendary drops from a bunch of legendary ghouls i killed, i was like wth is going on with this server. Then this non-legendary dropped like a dozen legendary items. Servers mess up and occasionally they assigned multiple items to one creature. 
---
You can't on ps4.  Except if you add them on the console itself.  I think it's stupid you can't ingame

We all assume it works that way. But what I'm saying is that I've seen it only dupe the base craft, not any bonuses from perks.

The only winning move is not to play.

Give it time. There will undoubtedly be a halloween event this year and probably something for the 4th of July as well.
---
i made a tool to work out the specifics. I haven't been able to  confirm 76 uses the same formula that FO4 did with any data miners, but the data I've captured seems to align.   
---
Worth noting there were changes made to PvP in both modes when survival released, so i have no idea what formulas there look like. I cant imagine they made any major changes to the core code, prob just implemented a damage cap. But i havent had the time to test it. I may just have to dig into the code myself. Not particularly good at coding, but i can kinda grok it. so hopefully I can tease something out.

I'm conflicted, because we know so little about it and about the legendary venter I'm unsure to save my stuff still may or sell it all for caps
---
I saw a guide on having "best armor in game" required something like robot chest, leather arms and military legs. Is there a way that this events out everything with pa as well?
---
I'm level 166 and I do too, solely because it isn't worth my ammo
---
‚ÄúI was never lucky enough to receive the reward, so it‚Äôs not possible at all‚Äù
---
I'd like to know this too
---
Not if the chance of a enemy being 3* was reduced.
---
Nope it has nothing to do with that. It‚Äôs some people‚Äôs theory that you let them regen their health and the loot will reflect that. After extensive tests I can tell you there‚Äôs ZERO correlation between hp regen and stars of the loot. 
---
with the right gear and perks regular 50+ Scorchbeasts are nothing, they go down so easy with vats crits
---
&gt;Assassin/sentinel, assassin/cavalier for pvp protection
---
I don't see how this can last though, because it means  you can't have a good build unless you are lucky with RNG or you buy it on on ebay (pay to win in other words). 
---
I just don't see how this can continue. 
---
Pretty sure nerfing of some kind is on the horizon.
---
None
---
Ok thx man
---
Unfortunately they don‚Äôt 
---
I felt that way... I started saving too much legendary junk for the legendary vendor. Basically making my character walk every where. Then realized it's like a month away. I dropped it all. It felt liberating having free space again. 
---
I'm always in fear that they will kill legendary spawns somewhere and make it hard to get any type of legendaries for the new vendor, and those who stock piled get rewarded. 
---
Then in say eff it. Because I literally cant play with an over encumbered character anyway.  (Wish I had a mule account)
---
I have a Rifleman character with the exact same Lever Action rifle. It breaks incredibly quickly even with level 5 Gunsmith. Best solution I‚Äôve found is two carry two of them on me at all times. 
---
You could also search around for another Lever Action that has a higher condition bar. Every Legendary (that hasn‚Äôt been duplicated) has a different condition bar. I did the same thing with Handmade Rifles and finally found someone selling one with almost DOUBLE the condition bar of my first one. It last almost twice as long. 
---
If you end up finding a relacement let me know. I‚Äôd buy your gun off you b
---
Same with every revolver right, it‚Äôs horrible and makes no sense.
---
They are just different. It‚Äôs like comparing apples and oranges. Damage resistance is the most important factor in the game and t51b/ultracite is best for that star
---
Give it time. ESO has been out for almost 8 years, 76 has been out for  less than 6 months.  Also, other than Christmas/NYE there haven't really been any major holidays since release. Having some sort of Christmas content (beyond atom shop fluff) would have been nice, but given the state of the game back in December I'm glad they spent their time and resources squashing bugs rather than adding silly limited time content.
---
The best alternative that I know of is to fast travel to Lady Jane's soft serve north of 76 and walk down the street just past the flipped bus and he is one of a possible set of random encounters at that bus.
---
Technically he does wander, but I don't think there's anywhere else that is as guaranteed, even factoring in people's camps messing up the spawn. The best way to do this is to server hop with a friend. Once one of you finds him, you both get on that server, and take turned leaving and rejoining the same server while the other one waits and keeps him spawned, he'll have a refreshed inventory every time you rejoin the server. Good luck!

Yep, 400 points in my sash is legendary raider and leather stuff

And can you fix non-foundation items from disappearing from our camp when its moved! Sure I can move my camp for free minus the cost of new water purifiers, crops, and anything not on a concrete foundation(ex.generators).  I've had several times where I only had to move my camp box 6 feet left or right and was able to place my camp only to lose several items that aren't stored.  This has been a thing since the game went live.
---
While I agree with the general sentiment that cap dumping violates the spirit of survival, that is not why everyone has no caps in survival. You said in an earlier post you spawn camp people. Someone goes in with 2k caps (I am a poor player who buys my plans from vendors so 2k is my average) gets spawn camped a few times, then they have 0 caps. I shouldn't be kicked out of survival mode because some douche found my CAMP, and the other spawns I try are camped.
---
No actually they don‚Äôt in this case the caps go to nothing and the economy isn‚Äôt based on it
---
Their is an underground road that runs from Watoga to Abandoned Bog town that allows below ground building. Great to make a bunker in.

Have you tried tweaking your screens settings? Turn your screens brightness down a bit, contrast up a bit.
---
Im on pc and can attest that night are dark as fuck I always need a mining helmet light. So think this is more your monitor than anything else.
---
Im still supporting your suggestion to add brightness and constrast scales in the internal game settings aswell. But try to tweak your monitor. ;)
---
The smart way to go would be buy all 90% reduced weight from people. Everything would be .5lbs to 2lbs. Also unmodding stuff helps with weight. Fyi.
---
Same! I'm worried about when you hit max caps- is the profit just going to disappear into the void? Is the vending machine going to 'hold' the caps from the sale until you manually take the caps? 
---
You on PC I am ALWAYS buying stimpaks!

How do you see leaderboards on xbox (for anyone else)?

Xbox. Srry.

fucks sake Bethesda
---
I've gotten some high level plans off SB, even think 1 dropped BOS leg plan few weeks back.
---
I was extremely surprised when I saw this item as free as well. I took a chance and bought it, despite not having the 500 atom... I'm happy to say my character is now sporting a swanky new hat AND I kept my 420 atom. 
---
At the moment there's no cap cost to building a machine in the files, but that might change. 
---
I was doing pvp the other day when ive had this issue occur. I was trying to track down the sniper that was following me and i popped a berry mentats thinking it would reveal him. It didnt and the only person that illuminated was my teammate but it wouldnt illuminate the sniper. The only reason i knew where he was at this point was the compass showed his dot from time to time and i got beside him. He was a low level so i didnt bother trying to do anything about it. But my berry mentats still didnt work beside him.
---
Good cave north of bailey family cabin near the ammo factory.run north from bailey spawn and should see it. 
---
never found her untill this post, agreed
---
Yeah like my last 10 hops I‚Äôve had 6 or so camps there lol. 
---
I‚Äôll try this thanks man 
---
It really was free, though. I got it even though I had 495 atoms.
---
Especially ones that don't count your kills correctly. I don't have time to kill 50-75 legendary's.
---
Annoyingly that is the only location.
---
How much time is left? seems kind of late to ask
---
Those are called muggings, how nuts
---
I‚Äôm always on the lookout for those type of tricks. About the only time I‚Äôll go or play in an area with multiples is if it‚Äôs a nuke zone.  Clusters of players can be a prequel for griefing or ganking. 
---
Early on in the game I accepted a team invite and they promptly went to my camp and destroyed it and then nuked me.  Good times! 
---
Got this error today too. :(
---
If I get caps from the first kill I‚Äôm not gonna try to spawn kill them lol. I said if I get 0 caps from a kill. 
---
I already have a fuckton of valuable junk, i guess i'll sell that plus the other fuckton of 1* decent legendaries.
---
- Option to rearrange a point OR choose a new perk card once per level. Can't do both. Starts at lvl 50.
---
- Still get perk card packs every 5 lvls.
---
The vendors reset every 20 hours.. There are 7 different factions that have vendors, so 1400 caps every 20 hours is max.
---
I feel like you Chainsaw lovers really need to give a Shredding Minigun a try...
---
I think it's more the removal of slap damage. There's no real way to determine between that or because of the introduction of Survival Mode.
---
‚ÄúCompletely broken‚Äù. You just need to server hop a bit more and you‚Äôll find one with caps. 
---
That's not how vendors work at. There are 7 different types of vendors, excluding Grahm. They all have 200 caps each, every day. If you look on Reddit, there's a lot of posts with maps of vendor routes that people take every day to make the most of them. Luckily this will be changing with Patch 8. 
---
I ran into him outside of flatwoods. 
---
A: that could be cool, if even the minimum amount of restraint is practiced. B: allow the owner to delete posts at will. 
---
And I‚Äôm also not worried about players that are just low on caps. There will be teams of 4 at whitespring all with 0 caps and they will log out/trade whenever they get a kill and dump caps so you could have a high k/d and be getting little to no caps as a reward. 
---

Near lady janet's soft serve. Look for the Turkey on the map. He spawns just past the bus laying on it's side
---
This is the dumbest component in this entire Fo76 game, it essentially killed the pvp experience. Standing still or hop like a bunny so you can rule a shooter game? It doesn‚Äôt get more retarded than this. 
---
It‚Äôs basically like having a Bloodied Furious or Bloodied Two-shot, whoever put sentinel and assassin into one should be fired. 
---
Even though it‚Äôs widely duplicated and abused it‚Äôs still not too late to fix it on Bethesda‚Äôs end. Simply making jumping negates the sentinel effect should do it. So you either have to stand absolutely still to enjoy the full OP protection or you lose the sentinel while you jump. 
---
If I had to guess, itll be like the fermintator. Itll be apart of the stash, but separate. So hopefully we arnt limited to weight or limited amount of items in the sales storage. 
---
Well isn't that just supper? Who thout things would break fast?
---
No it isn't 
---
It's called armor, look it up. It's called no one just stands there and gets hit, look it up. It's called a bloodied weapon which puts you at a disadvantage in melee if you're still it one place, look it up. Need I continue?
---
So using Covert Operative and Mr. Sandman do not do anything? Thanks for the info. 
---
There are multiple locations 
---
I have a 2shot crossbow that I use in lower level areas.
---
The best thing about it?
---
I can end up with more bolts than I started.
---
Each shot takes one bolt, but counts as two projectiles.
---
Occasionally you can recover bolts from bodies.  Lots of times, I get two.
---
Funny enough I think caps are becoming more valuable due to pvp servers. items going up in value as well as dupers getting banned. I know to a point caps have less value but in pvp I see no other enticing reasons to kill other than competition. 
---
My spiked fire axe does 150dmg and has 50% speed and AA effects.  And it weighs like nothing. Love it.

Yeah I'm having trouble with the tick blood too...I haven't come across any nuke drops to get the crimson flux needed. :(. I'm on PS4 though so can't help anyway.
---
We need stable methods for gathering plastic and acid.
---
It's a shame that they didn't keep the beehives from Fasnacht Parade in Helvitia. Being able to loot the wax every 20 hours would help a lot, as it was about 50-60 acid per loot. That's a nice buffer to player acid use.
---
Geez i forgot to add I‚Äôm taking either drink or recipe...
---
Thanks üôè 
---
I see, and since you are always the first person to kill someone, this is the best method to weed out the cap dumpers.
---
Guys. No
---
Grahm, the wandering Responder Bot Vendor, and the Watoga Station Vendor are all categorized as the same group, so they share their cap total.
---
Some people really have it in their head that there is a "right" way to play games. Which is rediculous in this game anyway, since arguably it's better to not even touch the story stuff until lvl 50 anyway since the legendary rewards are leveled.
---
I share using instagram.
---
Xbox one screenshot and\or capture.
---
Go to view them.
---
Get out my phone 
---
Capture, tag fallout then share.
---
Then i delete them from my brother's Xbox
---
You want them to move a vendor because you‚Äôre too lazy to walk around a corner?
---
Three dog hasn't been born for about 150 years yet.
---
I leave my camp open but if we had this I would have to find a door to secure just for the coolness if it. Be great for a bunker if we get those. Above ground or below, BUNKER WITH HAND SCANNER please.
---
I cant check because I bought it. I assume it's in 7 hours, that's when the store resets. It may go on for two days, but I wouldn't risk it.
---
I think it was intentional. People would be 1 shotting the queen on Nuka shine lol 
---
That would be expensive tho seeing as how they would be 3 stars
---
They need to guarentee a prime drop, if not plans than ammo or mods.  That way it makes sense to grind them out to prep for the queen.  If not that than something valuable so they aren't ammo dumps.
---
Nice, I haven't found several of these. Thanks!
---
No nothing specific but most of the rumours we have seen have panned out like the proper passive mode. Logically it makes sense since if they going to want to put a machine at a vendors camp, nothing more will ruin it if someone comes to your camp and then destroys it, so will be interesting to see how it works.
---
yeah when i first started playing in late december, i made a post here about how bright it was at night, i could hardly tell a difference from daytime visibility wise
---
someone replied that the nights used to be darker but people "complained" so they made nights lighter////
---
a horrible decision, it reallya dds to the immersion when the nights are dark, we have pip boy lights/PA headlamps for a reason!
---
"Randomly"
---
Just do what you can. It‚Äôs inevitable that some aspects will beyond the reach of some if not nearly all players.
---
One of my favourite aspects of games is when you can truly be consumed by them or play casually like I do.
---
It really isn‚Äôt the only option, at all. Look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aotn63/psa_charleston_responder_vendor_bot) I made a while back.
---
Naw, just take the 1-2 or 3 star trash items. People are dropping them as is. If you can cash in for legendary token - easiest way. 
---
But then if that's now how this system works D:
---
I remember them taking away the effect but do not remember a replacement being promised.
---
Yeah OP, you'll get one eventually!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say always lol but yeah whenever i notice I am doing that to weed them out.
---
Took down 3 lvl 85 sb over whitesprings this morning. Got ultacite servo assisted plans combat legs and a Marquee plan off all 3 plus 2 brains and 1 wing
---
who the fuck was talking about PvP asshole?  also there are tons of perks that negate that disadvantage, like serendipity for one...
---
Why spread false information
---
Fireproof and ignore. Kill if it lands. That's what I did and I even moved ny camp right next to a fissure. Got 100s of ultracite just passively, while also farming acid and lead. So far it's been my favorite camp location.
---
Check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aotn63/psa_charleston_responder_vendor_bot)

That‚Äôs how they display when worn. It‚Äôs not a bug, sheesh. They‚Äôve always displayed like that. Wear the marine wetsuit if you want an approximation of the shoes. 
---
Some guy made a video on 5 locations on youtube, just search, let me know if you can't find it and I will look for it later.
---
There's both of them squirrels and rabbit(s).
---
Though I don't play survival mode, I've seen many folks point out this issue. I don't understand why if I can't FT when enemies aren't around (even when hidden)...why the reverse isn't true. I think random spawn areas OR safe zones is a good idea.
---
I've made this same post, and seen it posted many many times.  Let's hope someone gets the hint soon and fixes this.  Seems like the game was designed just to screw with you.  Definitely a love hate relationship, love the game but it seems to take a long time for the correct someone to see and take notice of a post that is happening almost weekly.  
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll take a look for it
---
I don‚Äôt have a lever I want on lol. But it is on PS4
---
Lol, well I was solo defending the workshop with the giant saw thing, they prob saw it on the map as an event, and I think they wanted to jump in at the last second to get a free plan. Just turned into a cool photo op when they arrived over that hill
---
Then everyone would have all the prime plans. I've killed more scorchbeast than mole miners on my current guy due to his camp location. There woukd be no reason to do the scorchbeast queen anymore.
---
Look up Final Render‚Äôs acid cave camp on YouTube. It‚Äôs a really nice cave for building!
---
No sir you are a troll and a loser hope you‚Äôre getting destroyed on survival
---
I myself have a Camp about halfway between Watoga and The Whitespring and my Vendor route is to hit Watoga Station and the Super Duper Mart, Fast Travel home, hit up the raider station at R&amp;G to the south, head home, head out to The Whitespring and the Bunker, grab some technical data at the bunker, fast travel home, fast travel to Camp Venture for the data rewards, then hit Harper's Ferry, fast travel to 76, then fast travel to Grafton and then that's all 7 and I'm done.
---
Can't wait for the Whitespring Vendor Consolidation and I super hope that a.) there'll be an extra spot for one of the travelling vendors and b.) the Whitespring resort interior will be a no PvP safe space in both game modes.
---
+karma
---
From what Iv heard Nuka cola dark works with it and the Nuka perk going for x6 in strength and endurance. I haven‚Äôt tested it myself because the recipe is on my low level character that doesn‚Äôt have those perks.
---
How many hours left on the clock?
---
Sweet dude thanks!
---
Who said anything about pvp rude person. Go use it against any enemy. A ghoul for starters, let us know how that works out. 
---
What kind of replacement would it be? I can get behind explosive bullets, what would be the similar effect for an energy beam? 
---
Perhaps:
---
Overcharged (works in function like explosive, uses more ammo/lowers durability faster) has a blue/purple beam?
---
Nope. 30. 
---
Apparently NO ONE ITT read the latest Inside the Vault...
---
what the fuck are you on about?  the ripper is a good weapon for melee dps, period.
---
You are crazy sir/madam
---
Caps.
---
Now I want a pet rock.
---
How am I a troll?? Because you dont see the need for something means it shouldn't be there?? Alot off ppl are out of alot of caps junk n aid because of me lol.. I cant pvp to often as I'm over weight from all the loot I keep gettin is my only problem
---
I've waited a loooong time for nothing, pretty sure it's bugged
---
Its the cuttlefish of cthulu!!!!!!
---
yes, I love me some GWAR
---
It's multiplicative. Without counting the reduced damage from armor value, lone wanderer, or any other % modifiers, a full set of Sentinel/Assassin reduces damage to just over 29% of it's original value if I'm remembering correctly. Now, I don't know if the remaining damage is what's plugged into the DR/ER equation or if that was taken off the top, but with everything included you can get damage pretty damn low. I'm talking invulnerable to everything but 3k damage meathooks and the like.
---
Cards leveling is not dependent on your SPECIAL skill spread. So you can level any card up as high as you want and then you fit it into the build where you want it. Often a complete build will be "done" around level 56 if you planned perfectly.
---
I only have friends that want to build things so I‚Äôd be down for a pve buddy :)
---
happened to me last night. i just logged, waited a while, then logged back in. i wasnt server hopping for anything specific, just wanted a different server.
---
I've literally never had a problem just showing up in front of a newbie and giving them treasures. Last night I had a bunch of extra junk and stuff and gave it to two level 8s, they were heart emoting all over the place. 
---
Which is why I asked? Take it easy dude. So why do they look different when you inspect them? 
---
Nope! I want to move the vendor to be with the other vendors and in a more visible location that has other content. 
---
Are the devs also aware of the issue with anti-armor legendary effects not working on energy weapons? I have an AA flamer I so badly want to use but right now is just a dud.
---
My furious all star wiffle ball bat begs to differ. 
---
It seems so lol
---
slider for chat is all the way to the right.
---
All the other audio plays correctly - ambient, noise, soundtrack, etc.  IDK whats the cause.
---
Seems like random - works for a while, quites for a while, starts working again.
---
PS4 device settings for audio are correct and test results are as expected, not muted at that level, either.
---
Frustrating at times.....
---
I could be wrong, but don‚Äôt you only need to be intoxicated for the final xp push to tip you over the edge into the new level?
---
Server hopping still works.  You are just a bit unlucky currently 
---
/u/valseek when does the 1st week's survival challenge end and the 2nd week begin?
---
Fortunately that won't be an issue once pacifist protects your CAMP as well.
---
You‚Äôre just careless. Every function does not need to be bubble wrapped for your safety. 
---
No, but the Whitesprings vendor will call you ma‚Äôam
---
Maaaaaaaaa‚Äôaaaaam
---
It‚Äôs pretty funny. 
---
Grahm is part of Watoga now? He wasn't at launch. Thanks for letting me know! 
---
Boo that sucks but I guess it would be too OP lol
---
Those players certainly have a lot less bite 
---
Your situation sounds like it might have something else going on, because crazy damage melee builds like that should always do visible damage, from my understanding of the system.
---
Cool I‚Äôm trying to get some boost for non melee haha
---
In addition to those two sites, there is another spawn point due north of the parking lot at Prickets Fort.  When you travel there, turn left and walk until the cliffs are on your right.  Follow the cliffs to the second gap.  That's the spawn point.
---
why are you placing generators on the ground?generators? you dont have fusion? 
---
when you move a camp, store everything on the ground.
---
Cause he felt like mocking the OP by sending him on a wild goose chase.  
---
Taking it out of the game in lieu of a more lore friendly effect is what I remember. It was on a post from the games forums not from here or a news posting. 
---
No it really is not. The buzz blade, yes. But the ripper does too little damage and requires too much time to actually kill anything. You know the knowledge I'm trying to provide, it's almost like I know what I'm talking about because I have one...Who knew? Now Mr no karma are you simply that new to Reddit or is it that you're hiding behind a second account to use your rude words and not get banned for it? Either way next time you come at someone, maybe take the time to realize that they may know what they're talking about.
---
I need those Drills and Syringers for legendary vendor.
---
He‚Äôs been part of Watoga for as long as I played.  Mid December or so.  Not sure if it was changed prior to that or if people just didn‚Äôt have enough data to know prior to that. 
---
The game presents you with a confirmation box before every transaction. Just slow the fuck down.
---
what is the chameleon exploit?
---
If you place your CAMP down halfway up the cliff above the cave you can also build on the iron deposit above so you get access to two resources.
---
traveling pharmacy is your friend
---
XD now acid used to bulk with 10 and give you back 15 til they patched it
---
I haven't gotten that one yet.  Seems like I mostly get beer recipes.
---
15% is still decent with the strength from Nuka dark it‚Äôs kinky 30% extra dps. You wouldn‚Äôt be missing much it still helps.
---
Players with gear can literally 1 shot them with melee. Sorry but if your not geared the only reasonable action is to run. 
---
2 levels already. It hurts putting any of it back into my stash. 
---
Perhaps, I haven't had the issue occur in a very long time as I take much more time waiting for the screen, server to respond to what I just click or refresh and just swap items around as it does as you sell things.  Maybe it's and extremely hard fix but it'd be nice QOL fix IMO.  
---
There seem to be several camps in that area - possible you are trying to build on the same site as another player?
---
Third person also speeds up the lever action reload. I think third person might just be the way to go in general 
---
Try joining a friends server you are not with, a lot easier than trying the good old login-logout
---
need that third, 90% is a lot
---
The glitch was that you heard MODUS telling you that you failed the mission.
---
Im guessing melee is still strong, but more so as a stealth kill option
---
Nah I think it has to do with the fact that it has no mods, because spears act the same way and they definitely come in non-legendary form.
---
Free hat free hat
---
i love reactive plates  for pa 
---
Watoga is highly trafficked, and people will strip the power armor spawn and sell the pieces. Try the PA spawn at Solomon's Pond, I collected a full set of lvl 50 T51 there when my camp was nearby.
---
Thats right, but at level 200 you need so many xp, you may level up only once and you have to grind like crazy whole day.
---
People are making new characters for this, which is bad game design.
---
I'm about 50/50 running into this these days.  In fact, the other day, we even had issues with the previous stage with some mainframe cores that were destroyed for some, and not others, preventing the force field from dropping.
---
I couldn‚Äôt remember where I found some so I‚Äôve left the locations blank but if I find out in the future I‚Äôll edit it in :) 
---
What kept you?
---
That's the vault raids; I'm hoping dungeon raids aren't included in this but rather with the legendary vendor release since it's in the files that there's a huge hole at the end of the dungeon where you'll be able to interact with the legendary vendor.
---
&gt;Now Mr low karma
---
lol who gives a fuck about useless internet points?  and my account is new, says so right on my profile
---
&gt; next time you come at someone, maybe take the time to realize that they may know what they're talking about. 
---
that's literally my point to you, I never fucking said it was the best, but you're acting like it's shit, and it's fucking not, so fuck off you moron.
---
That's some low effort April fooling there. That's just sad.
---
This! Please Bethesda, add more songs. They don't need to be classics. Just some new artists that won't charge you arm and leg and would welcome the exposure the game offers. I recently heard this guy called Orville Peck who IMO would be a perfect fit for this weird post-apo-western-Appalachian theme of yours. He's just released his debut album and I would totally buy it via your game as a radio station. Just imagine listening to [this song!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3esGD6lcMM) while wandering accross the wastelands at night.
---
I'm giving the game a break for a while I bored after 200 levels lol but I know that was in place to avoid griefers.
---
My powerfist is 370 base damage with my perks. Then with +Strength and +Melee food and drink I can get it to 420 in the daylight. Then since it's instigating it's double that assuming the target is at full health, so now we're at 840, then triple that for being in sneak and hidden, so now it's 2,520 plus depending on my rads it could go up even higher. If I really want I can go higher with drugs like fury or drinking whiskey instead of beer.  That particular day I should have done a minimum of 2,520 damage and I did zero. 
---
I've saved myself a whole week of misery by bit participating in the crapshow of survival. I didnt even need to see the carrot to know it was a trick.
---
Assasins armor, some dope weapon like TSE or bloodied handmade and sneak just camp somewhere and wait for your victim. Until they lower things you lose on death rushing is not good.
---
You are absolutely correct! I just tried logging in again and I got just the helmet by itself so im going to have a long day
---
Are the vault raids going to be PvE do we know?
---
If they‚Äôre only in the PvP server that will be balls.
---
Saw this on the groups on xbox the other night and thought about checking it out. I'm sold now, and ever since i got the ritual mask from the B.E.T.A I've never taken it off lol
---
Thank you, i will give this a try
---
It seems like there are not egouth players. On survival it puts me on same server for infinity tries sometimes.
---
In addition to the solid explanations about factions and the 20 hour reset, remember that sometimes vendors will show 0 caps but actually are reset. Always try to sell them something. If they‚Äôre reset it‚Äôll work and you‚Äôll see the correct total after. 
---
&gt;I have wanted to build a very nice camp......Ugn lol
---
there are other spawn locations for that spawn pool
---
There are still explosive energy weapons ingame, they just dont drop anymore. I have explosive cryolator at mule.
---
There is a roadmap that gives a rough idea of what's coming. 
---
Hahaha Bethesda caved? Or wait, is this a Vault opening and letting out it‚Äôs populace? No? Maybe just these NPCs finally found their way back to the area. 
---
No, that cannot be it. Bethesda must have caved.  
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I do.  I actually asked if this was fixed in a post and got the reply that it totally was, my bad for verifying but hopefully it helps someone else from making the same mistake.  Anyway still strange IMO.
---
I build workshops. Or craft, modify and repair my armor and guns. Then bulk what i can.
---
Sumer content is next.
---
Thank you for all the time and effort you put into this and for posting it. All the info in both threads are invaluable!!!!
---
Seriously? Downvotes 
---
Im not sure if it counts but I do have an Armor Piercing LMG in my stash. I don't know if that's a mod, but if not I guess that means theres different types you can find?
---
id love to see a sort of Purple or Blue laser, on impact it explodes like the explosive prefix. it could be called Ionized. would even work with plasma, they could fire one color while lasers fire the other (both being beams)
---
"Ion Beams explode in area damage"
---
A low level can lvl up 3 times but probably can‚Äôt easily claim Danny Homestead, which was a recent challenge. Not all challenges are easily accessible by every character. 
---
Game is still ass and has a long way to go, but at least it doesn't crash now.
---
You can pretend people weren't sold an early-access beta at launch disguised as a full game if you want, but you're delusional if you think so.
---
start a new character
---
Don't count on the prefixes changing significantly anytime soon.  
---
The Watoga Assaultrons will call you Sir (or Maam) after Mayor for a Day.
---
Quite a lot of bugs have been fixed since launch. (Let's not just forget how bad duping was for a while!) Thanks to Bethesda continuing to work on things, the game is in a much better state now. Also, Anthem has stolen the "omg worst gaem ever" thunder.
---
I say the same thing every chance I get on posts like this and am downvoted into oblivion. 
---
And by posts like this, I mean the gratuitous patting on ones own back for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù noobs. 
---
Second only to the other posts, ‚ÄúI have a ton of trash I don‚Äôt want, I don‚Äôt understand why noobs won‚Äôt take it‚Äù. 
---
10 but does it affect the quality of loot you get?
---
[Summer and Fall roadmap ](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/fallout76_roadmap_2018_02-21_final.png?w=1000&amp;h=563&amp;crop=1) 
---
Doubt
---
Having that capability would be awesome.  
---
I‚Äôve found a nice spot over by the whitesprings train station that gets a decent amount of traffic for my trading camp
---
God this community is great!
---
I understand you...
---
Those are rookie numbers! I'm sitting on over 200 super and nearly 200 regulars lol. 3 stars in that perk makes all the difference.
---
I don't think there is a armour peirceing mod so you probably have a legendary one.
---
I just wish the plans were the same name as the actual item.
---
It's called the LMG but the plans are called the MG42.
---
Not for power armor.
---
Them not dropping anymore is the problem. Ballistic guns have AA and can get a damage effect energy weapons cant get. It is too imbalanced for my liking. 
---
it directly affects the value and condition of loot, I have mine at 15 plus unyielding
---
I clicked on this page, was about to click the link then stopped and thought... ah... you sly old dog almost got me
---
Try Wade airport. There's two there. Makes server hopping bearable.
---
I think I visited you there!
---
I need some ultra cite if you're on pc. Thanks
---
yes it does, it directly affects the condition and value of loot, including items that spawn in the world not just in containers
---
God. Damn. It.
---
I'm in the minority...I enjoy it.
---
Can you get recipes already learned? I feel like i keep getting more and more pipe pistol mods...
---
&gt;I have tried to remember to press X to transfer instead, which has allowed me to search enemies even after thier body disappears,   
---
Am I the only one who just spam picks up literally everything they have in the quick menu and sorts it later?  
---
I keep seeing videos of people playing and they seem to spend an eternity trying to loot things and decide what to take
---
That makes sense! And I agree I think the naming and listing are a big issue in this game. People have the same problems with the camp builds
---
Thanks for the info 
---
Upon logging in after Wastelanders launches, you get a new quest at the edge of the map.  You have to climb one of the highest peaks, outside the borders of the world.  As you approach it you see some armored men running at you.  You trip, and hit your head on a rock.
---
The hood on the pod opens.  You sit up and see other pods, some open, some with people still in them.  A walkway is illuminated for you, and you follow the path.  At the end of the path you see her, the woman you have spent nearly a year trying to find.  She smiles at you as you approach.   
---
*"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there."* 
---
The very first CAMP I ever made was on a copper node and I saved several hundred copper, that just recently ran out I guess. Every few weeks I'll relocate and build a new elaborate camp, I'm assuming lights take up the majority of it
---
thanks - can you tell us how you know this? Is it from testing the perk in your build, or from looking at game data, etc?  Something you heard from someone else?  
---
Init I love the wompwompwomp sound it makes, not tried it in pvp yet but if I was on the other end of it it'd definitely be an 'Oh shit' moment. 
---
That would be rad. 
---
There is Paul, who plays 1 hour a day and then there is Bob who plays 4 hours a day.  Why should Paul, who plays 1 hour a day, be equal to Bob, who plays 4 hours a day. If Paul doesn't have enough time to play Online game, maybe he should consider playing singleplayer games that run in phase that suits for Paul.
---
It's just getting them to land that's the challange.
---
Its different play styles for different people.  Some people prefer to farm for stuff on their mains and use a different character for pvp.
---
In wow I liked the 20 to 29 pvp bracket because it was enjoyable for me.  Since there is no normalization in FO, it incentivizes the behavior you dont agree with.  The game pushes for you to farm the weapons and gear on a different character to be the most competitive. 
---
Because it is pvp people will always do what they can to be competitive.  That includes farming gear on higher accounts to use on a second character to protect their assets.
---
The people aren't doing anything wrong by playing that way, they are simply being competitive in a system that was poorly made.  You either have to use similar competitive tactics......or you fall behind and will lose.  Sentinel gear may be cheap but people will still use it if it is competitive.   It's like the bloody build....yah it's cheap but its strong so you have to expect people to use it.
---
Pretty sure they just brought that over from Fallout 4 for funsies. Plus, I mean, you've been living in the vault for 25 years (which depending on how old you consider your character, could have been their whole life), it makes sense the robots know you by name.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre looking for legendaries, but you don‚Äôt need those to forgo PA. Take a few perks like blocker or ironclad. Wear metal armor for high ballistic def. Get Fix It Good to over repair armor to max def. Use White Knight to keep it in top condition. 
---
I regularly run around in non legendary lvl 20 armor even as melee and almost never die. 
---
so shitposts are allowed now?   ive had mine removed every time?!?!?
---
I just got him on Xbox if someone wants to hold him while I hop and I‚Äôll do the same for them. 
---
Summer will most likely get an expanded roadmap late april/sometime in may
---
u/ladydevann
---
My camp is a public rest stop. All workbenches, beds, a farm, water, and instruments for the well tuned bonus.
---
I look forewars to adding a vending machine so people can buy my extra ammo and other loot.
---
This is my new wallpaper lol
---
How did you manage to take sucjph an awesome shot? Did you like, ask them to pose or something? 
---
XD
---
I see what you Crammed in there.
---
all enemies have 2 inventories. one they use and one they drop. Supermutants usually have about 50 grenades, but don't drop them. That's how bethesda balance enemy nger and their loot
---
Tryna sell that vampires deathclaw?
---
Ever since they nerfed down the tse weapons it's near impossible. I don't waste my resources or time trying anymore on her. 
---
That is the whole reason I invested in a good handmade honestly.
---
Wrong
---
It should be like in the camp crafting menu. If you dont have the plans for it it's still in the list but with the big red "no" symbol beside it, and if you do have the plans for it but not the materials it's just grayed out like it is now if you're missing the materials/perk needed to build it
---
Right
---
I really want to see more about the cults and the interloper.  The other games had references and creepy areas, but we have  breathing bleeding actual monster now.  To see that wake up and cause havoc on the world? It would be epic.
---
The Element of Surprise 
---
Isn't the problem though that the radio isn't instanced for you? It's always synched to the server?
---
Gross, stalkers! Lol! 
---
Bloodied is incredibly risky on surivial. If you get the drop on someone they will most likely die, you are at a disadvantage when not low health, and anyone can kill you with rads when not in power armor, or literally anything will kill you when you try for decent rad resistance. Assassin sent won't save you from rads. Plus, I haven't been one shot yet by a bloodied even though I don't have good armor. Not worth.
---
Have a pic in a similar spot near there
---
You can see a tiny green blast wayyy off in the distance where my friend was getting destroyed by a scorchbeast lol
---
Thanks, forgot about Camden! Will try there later.
---
There would have to be a downside. Maybe have the radiated plants cause radiation and burning damage if nearby. 
---
It is bad but it is a result of FO76 system issues.  They load your character in before the game loads for you, and if that's the easiest time to kill someone they are going to abuse it.
---
You should load in and remain invulnerable to players for 1 or 2 minutes.  But things like this are overlooked constantly right now.  They throw stuff together and the players suffer for the poor implementation.
---
i wish we had more plants.  even if not nuked, just more plants to grow.
---
I just hope I will finally have a place to dump all my ammo. 
---
That's fair. I loved the settlement and radiant quests in Fallout 4, but the way 76 seems to handle enemies like an MMO was a big turn off for me, as was the fact that the settlements wouldn't have any people, which was the draw for me. But I still would have of given 76 a go if not for the stability issues and the dishonesty of Bethesda with the collector's edition and lack of transparency with what this game was.
---
I'll give it a go if I get a good sale. Thanks, dude.
---
&gt; You can argue "they should have done this" all you want but the fact is what Bethesda is doing *right now* is all that matters at this point. 
---
You need to hold people accountable for their mistakes. Otherwise theyll continue their fuckery.
---
Yep, I scrapped 3 pipe pistols a while ago and 1 and 3 I didnt learn anything new but with the second one I did
---
You can‚Äôt get multiples of the same mods. Pipe weapons are just very customizable, so they have a ton of mods.
---
Nuclear winter. All of Appalachia is constantly radiated, always.
---
It‚Äôs what the look like in menus or if you could pick them up in the world. The way a piece of clothing is folded when you look at it. It‚Äôs for display purposes only. 
---
Those sound like syringer ammo types but better
---
Hey, Fallout 76 already has a basis for inter dimensional time travel.
---
It certainly has been a nice change
---
Jokes on you April fools
---
I will refuse any random invites from now on...Just isnt worth the silliness anymore....
---
&gt; I guess a lore-friendly explanation why other NPC's arent using it is that the Vault 76 robots grew up with our characters so they would know our names... other new NPC's would not... i guess..
---
True, but if you‚Äôre level 200, don‚Äôt you already have one or more alts?  Easy enough to do quests and trade plans or whatnot between characters if you want. 
---
&gt;He retaliated by sealing the bunker and gassing everyone left in it, including Eckhart.
---
And if you go just outside the White Springs maintenance door you can see dumpsters full of skeletons. MODUS took out the trash when it was done.
---
Strange you should say that, I was tossing mini nukes at mutated ferns trying to score a couple of violet flux, but no luck. It would be nice if it make a localized area for a couple of minutes.  Maybe in a future patch (he says hopefully)
---
Mostly likely a snow covered world for a while
---
Nope, you see a shotgun and then they drop a pitchfork... WTF???
---
Where do you get that quest?
---
Aside from sights, I would love a mod to convert it to a Zhuge crossbow (repeating crossbow). The bolts were usually smaller, so that less damage per shot could be the trade off.
---
Or just be able to hide certain items so the other party can‚Äôt see it 
---
Tahank you Karthathan, very cool
---
Ok now this is epic
---
You craft with it. You craft and disassemble the item to learn plans. You make ammo with it. Certain things may pile up, like Asbestos or Antiseptic, and freaking Glass, but a lot of it with disappear quick if you start crafting weapons and armor to learn all the mods. 
---
She's still killable, you just need heavy guns to get her on the ground and melee guys and their op damage to chip away. This works best if the blast zone just clips fissure site prime leaving the drop site out of the radiation zone so the unyielding bloodied guys can take advantage of their armor perks by not having to wear power armor. 
---
Instead of killing Legendaries i think they will flood the game with legendary items to attract potential buyers of the game. They are already doing it with the survival mode where you can just play it (killing and looting Legendaries) and earn it (reward is also legendary). 
---
I played in a triple nuke zone cranberry bog over the weekend on PS4. After about 30 minutes into the zone I noticed I wasn't taking rad damage at all. Im willing to bet the server has something to do with this not keeping track of who is in the nuke zone consistently.
---
To be honnest. I was a Horder. I got tired if walking everywhere even in excavator armor. I dumped 600 lbs of crap at the charelston station last week got rid of everything but 50 of each items minus screws,fiber, adheasive ect. Dropped or broke down all my junk wepaons, dropped all my junk 1*,2* crap. And about 10 different PA frames. Brought my stash down to 150/800 and my Cary weight to 75/295. Now I have no problem with my stash or weight. What was killing me was my 10k of each ammo and meds. So happy to be free. Now to go scrounge more stim packs
---
Fort Defiance contains a bunch of them, since it's...you know, the Asylum.
---
Fort defiance? Just my best guess. Know I got the hats there.
---
Arg the mods/custom INI. I forgot about that. Thanks. 
---
Thanks. I guess kinda but the doc the other dude showed me has given me an idea of what legendarios are out there so I can make my build better.
---
All of u guys have great ideas
---
Yes...I do that from time to time when I don't absolutely have to get to my original destination.  Just yesterday I discovered a new location and I'm at lvl 261 with over 600 hours played.  
---
You can also send them over messages and save them to your phone/PC through the ps app, messaging thing.
---
Great suggestion. Since they changed the way Plasma weapons work, from a projectile to a hit-scan weapon), maybe they could change it back and make it into a colored ball of gooey plasma. That would make it unqiue and weird. 
---
Manny, if you have the mats, I can make all the tick drinks on xbox.
---
Didn't know any of that 
---
It's so satisfying when they crawl out of a fissure and you're right there to greet them with a Gatling Laser to the face, to be born and turned straight into a pile of ash. 
---
Alpha: 11142018
---
Survival  mode, kill people. Gathered so much thru survival
---
Weight isn't the issue. Each item in the world is tracked in a database. It is assigned a GUID. Each GUID takes up database space. SQL or whatever platform they are running can only do so much. 
---
Unfortunately I'm on Xbox. If you know of someone on Xbox with the same or the location I can visit to farm it, I'd be eternally grateful.
---
I feel like weapon skins in general are easy to make and would sell well, it's odd how little the atomic shop has in it considering how they gouge prices.
---
Welcome to the Cat House, home of SO MUCH PLASTIC. I had my house in the quoset hut there for a while. 
---
Haha, awesome! 
---
Yours is definitely a good experience to hear about I am so used to seeing all the negative post on here that I mistakenly thought it was the norm 
---
yeah, that is how i read it too, just pushing for that first strike by some war-hawk 
---
I have noticed though that if you break their weapon and they pick up one from one of their dead friends they will drop that weapon on death.
---
Wow sounds like a cool idea
---
Yea that would definitely be awesome. I‚Äôve got plenty of violet flux just from sbq events but wouldn‚Äôt it be beautiful if you can surround your CAMP with flash fern and radberries all the time. Nuked scenes are the most beautiful moments of the game, largely thanks to the radiated plants! 
---
Isn't that a bit basackwards?  A raider camp inviting folks to visit?  I'd expect a "raider" to be inviting but be trap laden.
---
All you're missing is the "quest complete" text.  You still have the choice.
---
For example, nothing says you have to actually &gt;!kill the Overseer's ex !&lt;or launch a nuke. You can decide not to and walk away.
---
Haha, awesome! Hope you got some cheap plans while you stopped by!
---
Dear Jack,
---
I enjoy this game.
---
I could explain until tomorrow, but I am going to play instead.
---
Very true
---
Thank you for your 'input' goodbyeüòÅ
---
Had that one happen also, but it‚Äôs rare.  Often times the pipe repair for the reactor area is bugged and gets stuck/won‚Äôt update before the timer expires.
---
it would have been an epic April Fools to have this guy wandering the map, running up to people and announcing there is a settlement under attack.
---
Ahh gotcha. So mostly used for camp build ...
---
I've been playing overencumbered for months. Stash is full, but I just have too much shit.
---
This will be a welcome addition.
---
Fucking child
---
Well I just found that there's a mod that fixes this. Has nothing to do with how the armor is "folded" it's literally how it's supposed to look. I'll have to wait for visual mods on console. Or it's patched.  Not a big deal. 
---
I don't upvote shitposts, but in this case, I will make an exception...
---
Dear Jack, your useless post is hot garbage.
---
And the "most useless post of the day" goes to.... 
---
This jackass
---
I bought one on xbox for 1.4k but I‚Äôm sure you could get up to 2k
---
Don't get me wrong, they don't pose a massive threat.  It just takes a few hundred 50 cal rounds or some other equivalent and the time it takes to shoot.
---
Raider vendor at Sutton train station had em.
---
Well it's going to be a seperate mode so you can forget anything someone suggests about temporary snow textures and such.
---
If I had to make a guess/wish list it would be a "hard mode" version of the game. So alongside a texture swap on the whole map they should include a heat/cold mechanic like that skyrim mod, more radiation either as a persistent slow rad effect unless wearing gas masks or just radiation hotspots and every enemy on the the map from the forest to the cranberry bog at a max level. 
---
Can we also get rideable unicorns that shoot alligators at enemies? 
---
All the times I come around these, I have yet to fail. Has anyone failed?
---
&gt; Tesla rifles? 
---
&gt;Assassin's Sentinel/Cavalier?
---
&gt;Certain mods for Power Armor?
---
Sentinel/Assassin's is negated in PA as far as I know so I don't think it's being used much at all in Survival.
---
Look at your ammo - missiles and mini nukes can take up alot of space 
---
They don‚Äôt cause damage when you walk in nuke zones though. Downside would be you have to use lots of gamma gun ammo to transform them and those ammos aren‚Äôt dirt cheap. After a certain period they restore to original look so you need to blast them from time to time. But at least during the blossom you can take incredible selfies! 
---
Hope so. I played all day saturday, and only found 4 legendaries. I did a lot of exploring too, then tried server hopping at wotoga and nothing. It takes a lot to find legendary enemies, unless your doing certain events. More events need 100% legendary spawns to make them worth while. 
---
&gt;In fallout 4, there was also a great big open world, and multiple quest paths to get you to two endings. That doesn't WORK in this game
---
Considering how little effect the choices had in Fallout 4, I'd argue similar changes are workable.  Killing off one Fallout 4 faction didn't really do much beyond reducing the number of available vendors.
---
Sure, but it's not like the queen has good loot anyway.  I'm all for a loot overhaul.
---
Or if not that, than something else of value. 
---
I'm still dropping mine. I dont forsee people ever needing to buy ammo.
---
I've only had the game since Early February, but I mean considering it's a launcher and causes area effect damage, I'm not really concerned with the  accuracy handicap that comes with TS weapons. Last night I found a level 91 glowing deathclaw fighting a 41 mythic in Cranberry Bog and took them out with ease. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard they spawn elsewhere though that‚Äôs why I was curious, haven‚Äôt found any coloured ones there unfortunately 
---
buy them from enclave upstairs in armory.  just like getting the pieces downstairs its a crap shoot and will take time and wasted money to get everything.  i am currently deep pocketed polymer on all pieces so 50 extra carry wieght and max ballistic.
---
Hey mine too! I even built a pawn shop! I just need those neon letters to make it official. 
---
worst foods? +3 Int, 200 health over 25 seconds, plus 1/3 to 1/2 food? 
---
I gotta know what you been eating. This is better than most foods. Heck the only thing I can think of that beats it is other scorchbeast parts.
---
It looks even cooler with the tactical red light. Eyes glow red. 
---
Well it's a game mode and not DLC or w/e so I'm hoping it's a tougher more grueling playground for all the level 100+'s who don't like getting ganked once an hour in ~~deathmatch~~ Survival.
---
Still free on PS4. Just got it.
---
Yea, I can repair stuff to 200%, I can still get like 30 or so shells off before it needs repaired. 
---
I've found him just south of the gorge junkyard workshop, as well, on the road to Morgantown 
---
Nukes zones, scorched earth, and buying on Reddit. Use green thumb and super duper. Can't say which spot is best, but if you find a Whitesprings nuke, there's plenty around the front entrance.
---
&gt;76 has one, linear quest-line
---
So does Fallout 4, Fallout 3 and NV.  The only "branches" are at the end where you get something like 1-3 slightly different quest steps as you wrap up the main quest.
---
As for side quests, try walking around some more.  Unlike NV, they don't hand you all the side quests while you're doing the main quest.
---
If you are buying operative under armor then you're right there. Enclave Service entrance has lots of crimson flux in the dumpsters right behind it. Cranberry bog is good too. Or if you are on ps4 I have a set of Shielded forest operative I will sell you.
---
They can keep them 
---
I love those almost daily strolls. The unpredictability of my encounters is usually invigorating.
---
Some balancing is without a doubt in order.  But I like to see that Bethesda is working to make it right.
---
Nothing like a good ‚Äòole hot garbage dumpster fire in the wasteland!!  
---
Let me at it!!
---
Sorry about your camp but glad to see you prevailed 
---
we killed her last week, took us about 25 minutes with a team of 10 of us or so...I went through a ton of ammo and many weapons....
---
Nothing like arranging to sell a 300 cap plan to somebody who then gets upset when they can't also have my beloved 3\* Lever. Every. Single. Time.
---
Yes, this could have been stated more clearly. The "two end results" isn't viable, but the branching quest paths TO that singular end point would be. 
---
Maybe you follow the over-seer all the way through, and there's a special vault somewhere with over-ride controls.
---
maybe the brotherhood finds a way to bypass security on the nukes, maybe you need to do a few extra side-missions gathering computer parts. 
---
With the enclave, once you prove yourself, you're in. 
---
Shit, it's a PVP game. Maybe you can choose to try to FIGHT active nuke launches/side with the SBQ against players. 
---
Yea, shame helmets are all cosmetic. I have a Mole the Mole mascot head that actually gives 1dr. I thought it was rather humourous. I'm wondering though, if you farm glass caverns for the BoS armour and dismantle it, does it give a chance to unlocking BoS mods for it?
---
My camp is a Brotherhood of Steel Recuirtment Center: So I'll be charging potential recuirts a discounted rate for ammo/weapons/armor. Everyone else who wishes to buy things are gonna have to suck it up and buy my surplus stockpiles of ballistic ammo/weapons at half price. Example: Lvl 50 - Lever Action Rifle = 150 caps - 1 cap per .45 round.
---
Hello my name is Jack amd my favorite color is clear.
---
Exactly!
---
Totally- they should rework it and the single action to spin up into your hand more like a knife does. Revolver ocelot  style. 
---
Equip the scrapper perk and clear out a super mutant camp. Every laser weapon scraps into 10+ plastic, and super mutants carry a lot of laser sniper rifles. It‚Äôs a really convenient way to gather huge amounts of plastic quickly.
---
Yeah! It's just you're likely to get a wider pool of the fallout fans who didn't dig 76 as a whole. 
---
Well it seems it does for some. It has never worked for me at Whitesprings in the Enclave area ever.....
---
Yaya. I already have 11 point in str and I'm already struggling with points and swapping around every time I want to do something camp wise vs battle.  We really need decks / different configurations. 
---
That being said, before level 53 some cards do have prerequisites to the special point they belong to. If you want to know NukaDragon has a great build planner that has the levels each card appear, as well as when you could/should take them.
---
Lol why did I get downvoted for telling this info
---
The HS in Watoga normally runs higher mobs, even so. I'd stick to Morgantown HS for plastic. It's easier and takes less bullets. Unless of course you hit it with melee. 
---
Cool thanks for the reply
---
I think, if anything, the excessive negative press made more people stick around than if the game simply reviewed bad on release and then was forgotten by the press.
---
*Note to self stay off reddit on April 1st 
---
I‚Äôve got a Vicious Plasma Flamer that absolutely melts (pun intended) enemies. I love it.
---
im sure it is because they are end game materials for end game weapons/armor
---
if you could just make them yourself then there would be no need to enter nuke zones
---
Yes what materials you need 
---
I saw a sheepsquatch horde mission and when I fast traveled to it it was nothing :(
---
It's April 1st...
---
Do not pick up the ones that did spawn and server hop. They have a chance to roll any of the rare variants when they spawn in, though if you take one it will not respawn that location (kind of like plans)
---
Are you in survival? I heard that about survival.
---
Nah, they'll just keep the pattern going from the keypad doors and only put the scanner on the inside.
---
(I really hope that ends up being sarcasm)
---
Spontaneous invulnerability of the Queen has  been known to happen.  You'll be making great progress, and then from out of nowhere, the health bar simply won't budge a pixel more.  I doubt a dozen players suddenly became weak.
---
If we had hand scanner doors and you knocked it down I‚Äôd just kill you and repair it. I have so much junk I made another account with 5 different characters just to store it all.
---
I'll take it. Sweet Jesus I'll take it. make it so Bethesda lol.
---
The Verdant season increases flora. 
---
And you are excited?!   Mama mia!
---
You do not.
---
Thank you for posting this! So my other first last week other than killing the SBQ was to finally launch a nuke at lvl 96! So off I go... I make it through the quest no problem at all, until I get to the part where I need to replace the 15 mainframe cores. I saw the little pip above the tinkers bench but when I got there I had no plan for them in my inventory and I must have picked up 30+ of them but none showed in my inventory either... So after much time invested I just left. I will go back and try again.
---
Not gonna work as you expected. What nukes do is turning low level legendary (42) into high level so the loot is at max level instead of 30-35. But it will NOT turn normal ghouls into Legendaries. For OVN event in all the sessions I played I haven‚Äôt seen many legendary ghouls at all. A bunch of crowned ones with treasure maps yes, but they won‚Äôt turn into legendary even when you nuke them. So for best bang for the nuke, WS is still the go-to place if there was a good number of low level Legendaries to begin with. 
---
It's a "long list" of short quests. Weekly challenges aren't quests, and biv quests take, on average, two minutes. 
---
In fallout 4, you have quite a few side quests that take 20+ minutes to complete. That's just not here. 
---
I do play it, I just expect more out of my side quests than "brew a beer, wait half an hour, bring the beer back to a robot". If you think that's "equal content" to the side quests we got in 4, you're...delusional, but you do you. 
---
In 4, we had kid in a fridge, which was a pretty short side quest, and fallout 4 quests went...you walk along, you find Billy, you open the fridge, you walk a while with him, you get presented with a moral choice, you can sell him or say no. That choice presents you with caps then, or the need to fight people later.  
---
Seriously, do YOU play this game? Did you play 4? New vegas? 3? Can you _honestly_ say the side quests we have _now_ are of the same quality as in _any_ past fallout  RPG?
---
I don't give a _shit_ about what future content might bring. It might be AMAZING. I can only judge the game based on what it _currently is_. 
---
It's _currently_ more stable than at launch, but it's _currently_ fucking piss-poor on the actual content side. 
---
I agree although as a stealth melee player myself I find myself getting killed pretty often by people apparently using two shot explosive handmade rifles or by legendary tesla rifles.
---
Not in PA. No diseases and no cripple damage
---
Oh yeah and didn't they buff scrapper recently? 
---
That is an idea that I haven't thought of 
---
The veterans who go hang out at Flatwoods (where I have my camp set up because Brahmin Milk is keeping me alive!) have really been amazing! It's not just the goodies -- though I did appreciate the tuba plans last night -- it's also the useful little tips that I wouldn't even think to google. 
---
I can't wait to get to high levels and pay it forward to the next wave of new players and alts. 
---
They have announced they are going to have "all vendor factions" represented at WhiteSprigs, with the exception of Enclave (as they are right there anyway), so I think it would make sense to keep her there.
---
Nice now i can focus those point in something else, thanks
---
Gotcha, thanks for the advice! 
---
I heard one youtuber talk about reactive plates being very helpful in this mode. I may have to give that a try with my PA character.
---
No diseases? thats even better thanks for the info
---
Yeah but I had 600 of them last night to go through haha
---
Wait it does?
---
There are a few triggers scattered around. The easiest, and most natural, way to trigger the quest is to read a log in the Firebreathers‚Äô headquarters. Alternatively, you can find posters advertising the Garrahan v. Hornwright competition. Finally, you can just go directly to the Garrahan headquarters.
---
Someone mentioned reactive plates being helpful.
---
No just adventure. 6 more relogs later and I‚Äôm finally in another server. Really tested my patience lol.
---
I got infected while in PA from enemies.. 
---
Literally says in game if you use the challenge tracker.
---
it's called a build, you can't change your build in an online game, just being able to swap perk cards is more than you get in any other online game, don't like your build?  either respec or start a new character, this is not a new concept
---
I agree we need better loot from it or something like a scorchbeast nest raid or hive raid 
---
Like killing 3 scorchbeast queens and 8 scorchbeast  then going in the hive to destroy the egs and looting it for prim ultracite fluxs that can be used to make aid items and rare flux how ever it only lasts 2 days but in return it makes a sent that will summon lvl 30 scorchbeast that do more damage and drop basically next to nothing and give low xp and doesnt count as a kill in events also its a rare event that only comes once a year and cant be nuked 
---
Patched.üò©
---
...did you play new vegas? or 4?  I'll grant you that 3, the worst in the franchise, isn't much better than 76, but at least it had side quests. 
---
4 had multiple factions that let you play different quest lines to get to the same objectives, with the eventual "benefit" of quests to take out the other factions. 
---
New vegas had multiple factions with multiple questlines to get you to completely different endings of the game. 
---
These aren't, in any rational sense, comparable to 76. 
---
As for "get out and explore" I am so sick of people who think that's a good argument. Sure, it's got a beautiful open world, and that's the _only_ reason I still play the game, but saying that it's an _acceptable_ replacement for _actual gameplay mechanics_ is fucking insane to my mind. 
---
Yes, there is choice in that sense, but it will stay incomplete. Whereas, some quests in previous games had multiple ways of completing the quest. Some gave you a specific perk based on the decision you made to complete the quest. And when you go back to that location, the people there or location is different. the closes thing i can think of in 76 that we get to that is powering up a plant. it makes a change to the world. it's not permanent and i get why it can't be, but i would like to see more stuff like this.
---
I think they are trying to eliminate server jumping.
---
Jump on friends servers, usually that will fix that problem for me
---
I'm not sure. I personally didnt downvote, myself. Replied only.
---
Haha no they approached me like that, over that hill, but when you go into photo mode, it does a little camera emote above your head, so I could tell they noticed that and decided to hold the pose for a minute or so until I had it. I'm thankful for that little emote signal, it usyally does cause people around me to stop what they're doing for a couple seconds
---
I've never been stuck to a build in any game, they all have massive respec, or multiple builds. 
---
Be cool if it was like adventure without the level caps in the low level areas so I can walk around the forest and actually be challenged. It sucks being high level I enjoy the forest and other low level areas but its boring going there at high levels
---
Yep. There was a mod for FO4, which had extreme environmental challenges. It‚Äôll be like that. 
---
Very much this. I really enjoy slowly stalking platers in the top 3, and wanted players, and surprising them which more often than not ends up in me winning the fight. Unless I forget to turn of pacifist mode :-/
---
Handmade rifle 76/1,003,672
---
WhiteSpring during or after a nuke, easier to see once a nuke ends. Or buy from someone on 76bazaar sub, easiest way. Here is a video they shows you where [https://youtu.be/Y-PUUxSFe0s](https://youtu.be/Y-PUUxSFe0s)
---
I‚Äôm a noob, are BOS plans rare or something? I‚Äôve read about them a few times, but my level 18 dude looted arm plans the other day and now I‚Äôm curious.
---
I agree today‚Äôs, while out of the norm, was just a little bit of awesome. 
---
I'm sure that if implemented, there would be a few conditions to deal with. Either very short term activation, or high cost involved, so you wouldn't gave 100's of flux. 
---
It's true!  But 150 years was long enough for the legend of 3DogBot to spread through the wilderness until it came to the Capital Wasteland.  And there, a young DJ-wannabe was inspired to take his on-air name.
---
PA builds still get diseases. You are protected from breathable hazards, tho - and some rad damage. 
---
Really?  I'd assumed it was local.  Huh.
---
Thinking that this game can be made light enough to run on the Switch is a joke all by itself.
---
And if you're running low health build, serendipity does not work in power armor but dodgy does. 
---
Try restarting the game, but maybe there‚Äôs a disease or something preventing it? 
---
Yeah she scales in such a way that there isn‚Äôt a point in trying her if you don‚Äôt have a few heavy weapons to keep her down and a bunch of op melee builds. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll bring my .50 cal to help sometime. 
---
Not sure if bloodied even adds extra damage that is significant. So you are trading away a lot of health for barely any damage.
---
not one has multiple builds, and most cost in game currency to respec
---
I know they‚Äôve been working on the game, they just made a lot of poor decisions. One example is leaving all the duplication exploits for players to abuse over Christmas and for a few weeks after. A portion of the duplicated weapons, armor etc could have been avoided if they hadn‚Äôt done that. There‚Äôs a lot of other examples I could list too but I‚Äôve done that enough in the past and really you should know them yourself.
---
They also can‚Äôt receive much credit in general, really. They literally copy pasted things from previous games. Fallout 4 is an obvious one, and there‚Äôs code referring to the different types of dragons (ie. elder dragon) from Skyrim in the scorchbeast code. LITERAL copy paste - I‚Äôm not just saying that. They highlighted code, hit copy, hit paste.
---
Indeed they did. It‚Äôs actually worth running now if you‚Äôre running low on steel or plastic.
---
Nuked zones are mainly for the legendary loots imho, fissure for SBQ and WS for ghoul crowds, flora is a byproduct. If people are willing to waste a lot of ammo, be it mini nuke or gamma rounds, they should be able mutate some plants right? The investment in ammo and yield can make it totally not worth it but that doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
IF they go down.
---
I spent 30 minutes yesterday downing one in watoga because it's circles were so large it was a pain in the ass to aim at.
---
Today I had one just fly in circles in a forest where aiming at it was pretty impossible because it was always too far or behind a tree.
---
It's possible sure but spending 30min on a single mob because you can't shoot at it is boring.
---
*increases damage on melee weapons
---
I always loved the attention to Detail Bethesda has given this game. The player on the right is standing partially at an incline. His character compensates for it by bending the right knee and placing the left foot at a slight angle, as if he is going to roll his ankle. Exactly as you'd expect someone to stand on a slight incline. 
---
Head to Pylon V-13 and listen to the audio log in the train car there.
---
oh fuckin hell don't do that to me
---
PS4. I went through all my ammo, my Gatling and .50 cal until they broke. Super frustrating.
---
Its good now.
---
Because of server hopping?
---
Maybe you don't have enough ap for your weapon even when the bar is full. Sorry but that's all I got. Good luck 
---
I know right? Photo mode in this game is so good, I take like, 3 pictures every session :D
---
The trick is a full Set of Sent/Ass armor, dodgy, serendipity, and fireproof. Pick a weapon of your choice. Legendary effects that make the most difference are swing speed and firerate. Shotguns will give you more 1shot kills, handmades are nice for vats users, lmgs are godly for non vats users. Keep a gamma gun for other Sent/Ass players and bloodied builds.
---
Thats one reason I'm not excessinvely concerned about being overencumbered.   
---
@51, discovering new places b/c I have to walk everywhere.
---
Only heavy barrel mod for .50 cal. 
---
Found that out after already having the mod learned, and after buying the plan and making like a dozen to scrap.
---
Well a fallout game did include a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy reference so highly advanced civilization and space travel is a thing an also doctor who was spotted in another game implying time travel is legit possible in the fallout universe 
---
Gonna put my face on a nuclear bomb
---
Haha.  I was just messin with you.  It looked cool af!
---
World of warcraft has up to 3 specs, and cost nearly nothing to respec. 
---
I bet I can research a lot of games and how they let you easily respec. 
---
I love skyrim and 76, I played skyrim for over 5000 hours across multiple characters. 5 different play through a where ruined after I went to markarth and did the prison break mission. The guards would never lose aggro. No matter how many hours you waited , it was a RANDOM GAME BREAKING BUG. Numerous playthroughs mirrak the og dragon born would not die. Just a random game breaking bug. The companions had the can't die werewolf , he would return right after his funeral and stop the other radiant quest givers from progressing their chains. I can go on of course, but I'll finish with the backwards flying scorch beast I fought yesterday at the white spring resort. 
---
I do very much love both games. Not hate , just honest observation.
---
Are those cat mounts able to be crafted at our CAMPs???!
---
You don‚Äôt need to hang onto higher lvl weapons or armor. No point holding onto a lvl 35 item when you‚Äôre 20, you‚Äôll find more of virtually everything (except the rarest legendaries) by the time you get there. 
---
It already started lol https://bethesda.net/community/topic/332719/leak-extreme-pacifist-mode-the-carebears-are-getting-what-they-want/20?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=1
---
Tried that once, the young gentleman from eastern Europe who has apparently enjoyed a very fruitful relationship with my mother certainly did appreciate clear lines of communication.
---
I run Vaccinated. So maybe that's why I never get any. Sorry if I mislead someone.
---
Probably spawn killing in survival. That‚Äôs trolling
---
Once I hit level 50 and got most of the armor and weapons (sans 'leet legendaries) and ran all the quest lines, I no long care about playing.  Started a new toon and only got her to lvl 4 or 5 before I just said NOPE to mindless repetition and grinding.
---
You guys who have several toons in the hundreds... Don't know if I should envy or pity you.  Got my money's worth out of the game, but I ain't giving it any more of my precious time.
---
...I fucking hate today so much. 
---
Itd be nice if there were any sort of alert, I don't love coming back to a destroyed camp and decimated crops.
---
if it's far away and not aggrod on you just leave it, and what's this about mobs?  we were talking about one scorchbeast, not a mob, and it has *never* taken me even close to 30 minutes to kill even 3 scorchbeasts, that's how long you have for the Queen and it's usually dead in half that.  lastly I feel like you completely ignored the part where I said with the right gear and perks.
---
Someone should do a full queen fight with each weapon and let us know how much fuel that takes.
---
If you need a second character to hold all the backup fuel, or a third, would also be good to know.
---
Has been an ongoing thing since I started the game but I will try again now thank you üòä 
---
Damn I checked their twitter to see if it was true, should have read the comments before hand lol 
---
Ah yes, want that insanly radioactive?I never did work out if it actually worked
---
You have not been one-shot by a bloodied because most of the PvP weapons that people are overpaying for are severly hampered in pvp. A crafted handmade will do almost as much damage as a BE handmade in pvp.
---
That was a rollercoaster of emotions. 
---
It could be? All things to stew on thank you! üëèüèº
---
Protection wise it would be T-51b, X-01 and Ultracite.
---
Last laugh and only carry a Mirv grenade. I call it "My Bloodied Valentine".
---
Maybe to the spin animation if you not currently in combat, and don't spin if you are
---
Are the wings/parts useful for something?
---
Also excavator if your looking for bonus carry weight.
---
This was one of the weapons I wasn‚Äôt interested in, but I‚Äôm worried the challenges will be more varied and even insane for the others.  Pistol looks nice, as does the 50cal.
---
Yea those story are pretty old well before the price drop and doesn‚Äôt reflect the entire holiday season or the more recent promotion with wild Appalachia. Even then 1.4 million the first week isn‚Äôt to bad considering.  Judging by the amount of likes on this post I am confident to say that the haters are out numbered on this one.
---
If not all of it then most of it - maybe specific regions could be under nuke conditions while the rest are plagued by rad storms. 
---
Any of the dozen+ spawn sites in the forest have had everything from Raider to T60.  
---
Might want to make a run through there.  Bonus is some easy XP along the way.
---
What is the point of locking your house... I get locking your water, but why do people not want other people to use their workbenches... There's no point.
---
Yeah that's a legendary. I have a furious LMG that increases damage with each shot that hits the same enemy. I wish i could find a furious .50 cal MG too.
---
a person can't be new to Reddit?  what the fuck?  and why not research  before you comment.  and yes, wow does cost currency to respec and no it doesn't have the ability to have more than one build at a time, there is not one game, single player or online, that has the ability to have a skill tree perked out more than once per character.
---
Oh cool! I didn't know that could happen. They didn't say my name for either of my characters. Or I missed it in my excitement to get outside 
---
I would say fighting over recourses would be a normal expectation.  Plus since there are other ways to obtain those resources, I feel that it isn‚Äôt a bad thing.
---
Risk vs Reward kind of idea
---
Cannot agree enough.  Additionally I'm confused why this isn't already the case as fo4 featured "greyed out" mods for 100% of the weapons in the game.  If you didn't know the mod it was greyed out and in the mod description it explained what perk(s) you were missing in order to obtain access to the mod.  
---
Fo76 should have that exact system with 2 new condition for why the mod is greyed out beyond missing perks "you need to scrap mode guns or find the plans for this" and "this is only obtainable via plans that you have yet to find".
---
That‚Äôs a great idea 
---
would be awesome if they did add these quests, also love the  3Dogbot  name. 
---
X-01 with blackbird paint and red headlamp
---
Fort Defiance, I think you take the elevator upstairs, then look around in the rooms. If you don't have the elevator unlocked yet, then you can walk the long way.. takes a bit!
---
Pretty sure the Legendary update coming out with Nuclear winter or sometime around then will act as a respec. You'll be low level again though.
---
I switched to X-01 early on because Ultracite was such a pain to farm. Do you think that's still true?
---
That‚Äôs hilarious!
---
So many weapons need love. Grognak axes? Please.  muzzle loaders? What the fuck is with the lack of customization here? 
---
On PS4 too, killed her twice last week with random players. You really need several guys with explosive or bloodied 50 cal and good perks to do it. OP melee builds are great too. It‚Äôs not for semi-autos and bolt actions. The loot still sucks. Got several duplicate plans and a zealot‚Äôs machete. 
---
Only way to feasibly do half of the level based ones would be to start a new character specifically for quick levelling. It's just dumb on their part.
---
I thought Legendary Character update is what will reset everybody to level 1. Does anybody have any info on that?
---
Oh yeah! Duh. Now that you say that, that's totally what that is.
---
Yeah, and the best part is that you can‚Äôt really do anything about it if that happens. All the low levels on the server can come and make the fight impossible since we still can‚Äôt play offline.
---
Another Wendigo needs killing! Wear a clown costume...
---
I mean who cares if they used code from other games? I‚Äôm not sure why that matters at all. The only thing the scorched beast has in common with the dragons is it flies and lands. The air attack is completely different not that it really matters to me.
---
God that thread is a salt mine
---
The old bug was that you'd get an extra hundred if you logged in while wearing the excavator armor.  As soon as you got out and got back in it was gone and you were at normal weight limit.  I had heard that bug came back a patch or two ago.
---
Try server hopping outside your armor then get in and check the weight, then server hop again while still in it (if you're up for it).
---
Like armor wise or material wise? I personally don't deal with ultracite at all. I use T-51b because protection wise, it has the best protection. It's only negative is low radiation resistance compared to Ultracite and X-01.
---
Maybe the people I was with just sucked and weren‚Äôt doing anything. Would be cool to get some good plans though. 
---
I love murgle 
---
...most of the weapon damage in skyrim came from different bow types, and that would be a hell of a lot easier than making a custom ammo choice in 76. 
---
Best I can do is 6 caps.
---
Would be cool if Scorchbeasts would always drop a max level legendary item with how they are supposed to be these rare endgame creatures. Maybe make it so a level 50 drops a 1 star, level 60 a 2 star and level 70 a 3 star.
---
Have him mark a spot on the map and have him meet you there laughing.
---
&gt;4 had multiple factions that let you play different quest lines to get to the same objectives, with the eventual "benefit" of quests to take out the other factions.
---
The only difference of those quest lines was flavor text, and whether or not you were killing the Enclave.  The end result of going all the way through one particular quest line was which vendors/hubs were dead.  Which, at that point in the game, has virtually no effect since you've completed all of the side quests at each hub.
---
&gt;New vegas had multiple factions with multiple questlines to get you to completely different endings of the game.
---
Which results in a different cutscene.  You also get a different name over the NPC boss you kill.  Not exactly massive differences.
---
As an example of how NV did not properly handle the choices in the game, I liked to kill Caesar.  It was rather odd to have his general refer to him as alive after I killed him.
---
&gt;but saying that it's an *acceptable* replacement for *actual gameplay mechanics* is fucking insane to my mind.
---
"You must hand me every side quest in the game" while I work on the main quest is not "actual gameplay mechanics".  It's the difference between theme park games and open world games.
---
Murgle? Never heard of it or whom. I must be out the loop.
---
Then you find the nearest scorchbeast and kite it over there.
---
The haters have been using this code argument like it some sort of gotcha but I don‚Äôt get it. Why would anyone really care about that? They obviously put some work in this game because the map isn‚Äôt the same as fallout 4 and actually the biggest map yet outside of daggerfall. Nearly 20 square miles.
---
I have heard that if you quit and then restart right away it will do that. You gotta wait like a minute or two.

Yeah, requiring starred legendary enemies for this was a fucking dick move that made  survival completely pointless for non-griefers.  It was the \_only\_ thing that would tempt me into that griefer filled shit-hole, but i'm not going to spend a hundred hours a week grinding for starred legendary enemies in asshole town. 
---
Crimson is super-easy to get at Whitesprings nuke zone. Violet is a pain and a half. Not enough violet flora to harvest. Would have to nuke a particular area for that.
---
I second this. It honestly has my favorite story of any Bethesda game I've played (fallout 3, Skyrim, fallout 4) by far. Honestly in enjoying the story almost as much as NV. NV is still better cause I influence it more but 76 still has a really well done story from what I've played. 
---
I'm kinda triggered 
---
No, it's a known thing, new accounts are made as troll accounts on reddit. It's a problem. 
---
And yes there are games that do that, I'm not wasting my time researching for a new account. Sorry. 
---
Ooooo that‚Äôs scary. And Atleast you have PA mods! And got to keep them.   I don‚Äôt have any mods yet. Can‚Äôt find/afford them
---
I agree, people that played from the start hand specced towards one build, only to have everything about that build changed is bs
---
Okay, well yes I guess I‚Äôd better try to find a nuked zone rather than looking for someone to trade with ! Thanks for your advices
---
I got an ultracite set just by finishing the boss quest line.
---
I mean... lol  
---
I don't know which Fallout it was in, but I think Mothership Zeta DLC is a far better confirmation of there being highly advanced civilizations capable of space travel in the Fallout-universe. :&gt;
---
Do we really though? Are levels that hard to get after you know what's going on? Sure it's not easy but honestly when is anything in this game.
---
You can just not wear outfit though
---
No possible way it could work as it would require everyone having separate radio stations with varying levels of music available, with all world radios on a separate channel as well. 
---
Good luck üëç
---
I like this idea and have idly thought of it as well, but, it would cause too much clutter I feel like. 
---
27 C.A.M.P blips covering the map would make selecting fast travel difficult at times.
---
bah ill just cut your head off, problem solved, Juan S√°nchez Villa-Lobos Ram√≠rez
---
IT'S. MA'AM.
---
You're missing the story if you think it has to be given by voiced characters. There is Definitely a lot of thought out into the story with lots of small stories playing into the overall story. Same reason I like NV's story, even the side stuff helps add to the main story. You're being very superficial to think you need talking npcs to have a story told. 
---
well I did do the research, didn't find anything to support your argument at all, specifically about WOW, and I am a new account.
---
I read it that her hp scales with the number of participants of the events. If there are ten guys in the area and you‚Äôre the only one hammering her, it‚Äôs mission impossible. 
---
Primed 50 cal is really effective, during the fight for a moment I was the only one shooting at her while she was hovering, I could literally see my 50 chips away her hp bit by bit, I‚Äôve never seen it before with my gatling which should have higher damage per shot. 
---
There's definitely some griefers, but they're a fluke. I've maybe been griefed 4 times since the beta.
---
On Xbox, push start to view the map. Then, press LB-&gt; quit. You could also press RB (social menu) and select your own gamer tag, then press leave world. Both ways go to the main menu. 
---
I am playing about 6hours a day and i am avoiding these stupid challenges, they are not worth.
---
It‚Äôs much better. Most PvP players are cool but it seemed to get worse the longer the game was out. Now I don‚Äôt run into stealth characters ambushing me at workshops that they haven‚Äôt even claimed. 
---
Yea, its a quest reward from them. I think most people scrap it or sell it due to not having space for it, or switching to X-01 when they do the enclave quests. I scrapped my Ultracite, didnt have room for it and didnt want it xD.
---
Hopefully I‚Äôll make it home from work in time!!!
---
79 currently. Been playing the game since release but just had moments of rage with the bugs. I'm a team player and I know what I'm doing most of the time, so you aren't getting paired up with a noob :)
---
Hit the button that brings up the social menu of everyone on the server. Scroll up past the triple selection of Friends-Team-Recent to highlight your name, level and icon. 
---
Select it with your command button then select "Leave World."
---
Voila
---
Ye i have, but it is anoying, i play my main, because i have tones of plans, but not all. Why would i want grind another 500hours on another char. 
---
Don't worry, I'm sure Bethesdea will fix it.   
---
lol April fool's. 
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/85qbpc/mmorpgs_that_are_forgiving_in_terms_of_allocation/
---
Just for the sake of showing youre wrong, and did zero research. This was my first google search. 
---
Have a good day. 
---
Hell.. Just have a spot marked on your map that says "Meet Preston Garvey." 
---
It seems like it's synced for people within the same area. I've noticed that if I fast travel across the map and there are people there, sometimes the radio randomly jumps to the middle of a different song.
---
Straight north of the Welch station. He's got a little coffee shop.
---
&gt; and what's this about mobs? we were talking about one scorchbeast, not a mob
---
Are you playing stupid on purpose?
---
Oh but I am.  Todd Howard said that existing, high level players were allowed into survival specifically so that the developers could see what balance changes were needed and what exploits people were using.
---
Yup, got out and back in, down 100lbs.
---
Server hopped without removing armor, back up 100 lbs!
---
Like the 300+ in game lore books?
---
76 half assed everything. There is no excuse or reason to defend Bethesda when their parent company runs a successful MMO that isn't on a decade old spaghetti engine.
---
I'm pretty sure they said if you put a vending machine down at your camp it will pop up as a marker on the map. Which will be fine when they make camps immune when in pacifist mode. Don't know if they are yet. 
---
Breaks down to ultracite and love
---
This happened to me and I had logged in and out several times server hopping for materials, then once I was finished and went off to do something and server hopped again, it gave me a free placement and told me that wasn't a viable spot.
---
I'm thinking it's not necessarily your camp but things that  you place that possibly interfere. It wasn't until after I put down my crops that it interfered.
---
But regardless I agree, let us know before we place our camps because I spent several hours planning that particular camp build
---
Now I have had that happen. I'd be tmin the middle of searching a body and it disappears onky to become a meat pile elsewhere on the floor. That's aggravating, but assuming I can even find the meat pile, I can deal with that for now (that needs fixed too). Unfortunately most of the time the body vanishes completely and is nowhere to be found. That's what really aggravates me.
---
Don‚Äôt lock the front door on your camp, please. If I wanted to destroy your crafting benches and generators you think that door is going to stop me? Of course not. Leave it open so people can look inside and appreciate what you built. And rest, retune, repair and stash. 
---
Anyone find out where she (he?) goes, I followed her for a good 30mins and didn't get shown any encounters.
---
Ginger cat
---
Pretty sure that was 3.
---
...Ok, lets agree to disagree, because I'm sitting here trying to find a way to respond to this stupidity that isn't just a wall of profanity and insults, or just listing out all the fucking quests you clearly don't give a shit about, and it's not worth my time. 
---
You're part of the cult of people who are super ok with RPG's not having RPG elements, like "fucking quests" and I'm part of the group of people who loathe this fucking slide away from actual gameplay in exchange for "making your own fun". 
---
I like the open world, I like being able to explore it, but saying that it's "better" not to have quests that send you to interesting places and have you do interesting things for interesting rewards is fucking insane to me. 
---
I want "Both" I want the big beautiful open worlds that bethesda brings us, but I also want the RPG elements that they've managed to slowly strip away,  one by one, ever since they acquired the rights to the franchise. 
---
Do you have pacifist on?
---
this literally proves nothing you fucking moron, there is not one game where you can reallocate skill points without a cost, period.
---
Alrighty. I'm blocking ya. Troll someone where else. 
---
Nuclear winter santa claus!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbMq4NCHuhU
---
Kinda like that, it fits the "no npcs" feature too
---
Just north of haven church is a little cave under the road. I had a pretty nice set up in there. There's water for purifiers, dirt for crops, and you can build a decoy camp on the road above. You can see dyer chemical from the road. 
---
When it comes to legendary farming, I just walk the tracks on my vendor run. Ran into 5 3star legendary last time I did it.
---
Unfortunately scrapping Combat Armor doesn‚Äôt give you a chance to learn BOS mods, even if they are BOS modded already.  Only way to learn it is by finding the Plans for them. 
---
Go to the recent players list and just block a couple people for session. Problem solved.....usually. 
---
yup, the invincible players really are an issue! I hid in a cave from some and was accused of cheesing but i'm not sure how i fight against someone I can't hurt!
---
That doesn't really contradict how it should work though. Even if you generate the loot at time enemy is killed, they could look at what the enemy is wielding while killed and make the weapon/ammo match then add random other junk/aid/caps/etc.
---
If you find a price I might be able to take that off your hands.
---
I knew what day it was. I clicked it anyway...
---
Technically.... 76 **does** have an NPC, that is flesh and blood. His name is Grahm and he is the best. I love running into him just to hear what he says!
---
However, it does make me feel very lonely afterwards, as I then remember there aren't any other NPCs to interact with :( *\[No, the irony of my statement about feeling lonely in an MMO is not lost on me! lol\]*
---
Awesome - PSN same as your Reddit name? Cheers bud!
---
I play on adventure. 
---
Dang, that is frustrating, sorry I couldn't help. :/
---
Good in this game? It was super fun in FO4, if not super effective. 
---
Hahaha üòÇ i promise that the first time you traid its free after that you might want to bring a tribute  for your safty üòÇlol 
---
Sshhh.... shh-shh.
---
Let the man have this blissful moment. lmao
---
Events end, pvp enabled.
---
Should pretty much always stay away from super popular op meta gear. Just a matter of time before it's hit with the Nerf stick
---
It would have been awesome if it was some kind of massive turret, or giant cannon that could shoot you places!!
---
But I do not believe the Forest areas can spawn max level T-45,51b, or 60.  That‚Äôs gotta be higher level areas, and Watoga has four spawn locations in a relatively small area making it easy to hop and get many chances for your max level t-series items.  
---
Tube amps only!
---
I discovered a VTU under armour jumpsuit Plan yesterday by doing this, I was takign a walk from Top of The World to Whitesprings, a stroll is sometimes so rewarding.
---
Me, I always assume it‚Äôs a high lvl player with an alt. And then drop a protected piece of under armor. 
---
There is that, but I have seen people seek out players that are AFK in the moment and attack them. A lot of people tend to go AFK and do a few things before getting back to the game. The dudes house I was in was away and I could have easily killed him without making noise of destroying anything.
---
Yep. Exactly.
---
Actually, if you take all the pieces off, claim the chassis, then get back out of it, you can place the pieces back on it even if they're too high level. You then allow it to "time out", and it'll recall back to your inventory, taking up only 10 lbs. You can put it in your stash until you're high enough level to use it.
---
I never thought of that happening. Gotta be careful when playing with randoms
---
no, I genuinely don't have a clue what you are talking about.  I had to look it up to realize you were talking about a mobile creature, a term commonly use in MMOs, which a) I don't play and b) this isn't an online game, and my point still stands, if it isn't aggrod on you why even try to kill it?  and if it is aggrod on you there is no reason you shouldn't be able to hit it.  
---
if you need further proof watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZPWsBuTWTo)
---
Aww, I miss you too.
---
Start button (to go to map)
---
LB, then scroll down to quit game
---
Wow. Pretty cool picture. Thanks. This is going to be my wallpaper.
---
Yeah they‚Äôre basically a waste of ammunition lol. 
---
Lol I did sit on the guy's couch. He was AFK, and when he returned he did a double take passing the couch and then noticed me.
---
They don't land enough. Well, it's hit and miss. Sometimes they'll land for me, one after another. Other times they won't land at all. I think if you've taken out more than half of the health on a scorchbeast, it should look to land. Really annoying when you have to fight one entirely while it's in the air. 
---
Concentrated Fire + Tormentor. Crippling their wings makes them much more likely to land.
---
I'm not trolling, you are fucking dumb as fuck, get bent
---
Yeah I was just talking about getting more space.  It's a server thing. I believe they already said that there isn't a way to increase it.
---
&gt; b) this isn't an online game
---
Yeah, I'm out. The trolling is real.
---
Ya if they're working an event you could probably just hide out inside the zone until it completes. Give you a chance to find a good vantage point, maybe set a trap if you know roughly where they'll be at the end of the Event. Plus if the successfully completed the Event you'll get a reward too, right before you get the drop on them.
---
I heard about the server for the nuka paint and I often find myself the only one on the server in the early morning so I just had to get it.
---
 I kinda miss the prototype colors now....
---
I'm confused by people saying Whitespring. When people nuke there I'm lucky to get one or two pure crimson flux out of the little that's there. You definitely want the cranberry bog. All the cranberries and brain fungus turn into raw crimson flux and there's a ton of it. Cranberries out in the open and the fungus in the little trenches everywhere.
---
Whitesprings during nuke events has some, most are scattered but there is a group by the main garden near the walking paths.  I think there are 5 or 6 there so you can get 10-12 in that one spot as I recall.
---
awww thats exactly what I wanted to say man... shit happens
---
I don't see a reason to have player radio stations. You can listen to anything you want.
---
I just want to be able to hear Butcher Pete on loop.
---
Right now their bones and wings scrap for ultracite. The only place to get it right now is scorchbeasts, ore, and a few preset spawns. The ore isn't effected by the excavator armors ore multiplier and the preset spawns will require you to clear large buildings for ~6 per server hop. If you wan't to mass produce ultracite ammo scorchbeasts are the best way to farm it.
---
The chance for prime receivers is more of a bonus on top of this, but that is still more the queen's reward. Maybe they could come up with another loot structure that keeps both viable, but I don't think it's really possible without adding some other type of loot.
---
You can find a list of the ingredients here: https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fermentable_Tick_Blood_Tequila
---
the hardest to come by will be the stable crimson flux
---
endangerol, psycho and it's derivatives, and vats crits help a lot
---
Right, but it's a crapshoot deciding which event to join. Also events are being abused where PVP is initiated and then they run and hide in events to avoid PVP. 
---
The leaders on the board should appear on the map regardless of if they are in an event.
---
That way I could know where they are, join the correct event and have some community fun and pvp afterwards. 
---
thanks for your constructive criticism, i will take note
---
Hey hey!  Always loved that bug.  If you stay in the armor it will legitimately count as having an extra hundred carry weight available for as long as you can go before you need to get out and use a bench or whatever it happens to be.
---
If you don't get any other offers, I'll be home in about 7-8hrs
---
Thanks !
---
not trolling, meant to type MMO, this isn't an MMO, and it's not.  also did you watch the clip?  THEY ARE NOT HARD TO KILL.
---
If you really want to grief them you can cancel your event and then kill the people participating
---
Pvp is not at all about Social Interaction xD If you want fair ''Duels'' like in Western Movies or Mexican Standoffs try it with your friends. Open Pvp means nuke or be nuked, nothing else. Balancing this is almost impossible and Griefing, Kill on Sight is always a thing if you dont put Rules in front of it. 
---
This Survival Beta is only a Deathmatch Event, see you soon when Beth is going to fix this, and they will as Todd already said.
---
8AM PDT tomorrow then
---
A troll? It‚Äôs just a pipboy holding a weapon that fits well with the graphic. Highly doubt it‚Äôs anything more than that. 
---
Nothing about the builds are changing. Just the process in which to get them again. If you can do once you can do it again. 
---
Bethesda should make bulk junk NOT normal dropped junk. Done and done!
---
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO SAID THEY ARE.
---
DID YOU READ?
---
Oh I'd like more "space" as well. But I have found that I really don't need this or that. I mean, who really needs 10 bulked glass? 
---
Killer shot
---
Never left.  I have been living in PA constantly since the Beta on my main and aside from maybe 1 or 2 times a month I login and a legendary armor piece I had on before I got in the armor bumps off a PA piece, I have the normal bonus plus the extra 100.
---
sentinel doesn't work when jumping, people jump because that has literally *always* been the meta for competitive games, people jump because they are harder to hit, always have, not going to change now
---
you more likely have around 70% reduction. There's a math equation the more pieces you have the less return you get. It's diminishing returns. with a full Sent assassin set, lone wanderer and med x it was like only 78% reduction
---
Spawn Camping SUCKS!
---
Sentinel Armor Sets are so lame and goofy. Jump up and down all day. jumping should nullifying sentinel effect. jumping is moving c'mon
---
Non-PVP inside events is too easily abused. 
---
Top 3 on Leaderboard are able to hide their locations by hiding in events. They should still show up so.
---
it *is* bad game design.
---
And why spin it. If you have some used shells in the revolver, then chances are it's just going to go click and not bang. 
---
I suggest a small simple set up and then hopping servers until you find a location you like and doesn't move your base. I spent about 3 hours setting up in the mire near the edge of the map. Just to hop into adventure and get that same notification. It's annoying to not have a message pop up when you place your camp but it's worse to spend multiple hours building just to have the same message pop. Hope this somewhat helps. Cheers! 
---
&gt; by subverting all survival mechanics 
---
One of the survival mechanics of Fallout 76, which is different from other Fallout games, is that it's online and there are other people to help you do things... like survive. It's only a small difference so I can see how you'd get confused.
---
I did. Didnt see anything about this.
---
It's too bad they didn't animate the Hat. Kind of like the assaultron helmet. The ear flaps would be up when you're not firing and when you have your weapon out the ear flaps pop down.
---
nope, thought I was still talking to the one having trouble taking them down, now I just realize you are here to be an asshole because I didn't know what a mob was (seriously fuck you for that) and then you continued to be shitty when I made an error and typed the wrong thing, in conclusion fuck you for just commenting to be an ass.
---
who downvotes this stuff? this seems like an important bug to report!  Maybe its the Bethesda Devs downvoting this because now they will have to work on fixing more bugs?
---
Wow and of all days to find this out ...i'm just disgusted  with Bethesda....  lol good try bud
---
 I probably have 20units worth of plans ready to sell. Among other things.
---
 I agree. I find it interesting that everyone wants to rejoin the same server when disconnecting from SBQ, now everyone complains when we do.
---
no it's not like the vendors he resets at 8 pm eastern , so yes you can do it once a day but it resets different 
---
oh no is the name relevant to the ingredients?
---
Awesome what‚Äôs your IG name so I can follow?
---
üëç thanks I had a feeling I did it twice yesterday but obviously pre and post reset 
---
Then it procs when you land. Maybe there should be a cooldown. 
---
I really dont mind dying in this game. it's the point. But exploits make it no fun, spawn camping, etc, etc. 
---
Get gewd is definitely not the answer to why Fo76 is floundering. 
---
It‚Äôs been a big for a while.
---
i was about to write something similar. Once I found a niko bellic from eastern europe which one shotted me because I tried to tell him (THOURGH MICROPHONE) that my lever was not for sale...
---
(low level team member accidentally activated pvp)
---
is this April fool's ?
---
I found a cool ass cave in the north of the map, it had an upper cave that dropped down into a lower cave with an entrance for both aides and camping gear already out in the bottom camp.
---
Another thing I've been collecting. I went on a week long fast travel to (I am drawing a blank on their name..) workstations and taking it, defending it and moving to the next. They give soooo many plans. It's insane.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/rtrnofdmax/video/68555963
---
(Build) https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/rtrnofdmax/video/68551415
---
a lot of changes were made to perks, armor, and weapons, tell me again how those changes don't affect a build?  if I made a specialty build based on a feature, and now that feature is changed/nonexistent that's bullshit because all that time I spent towards that build is thrown out the window with the changes.  I spent months building my melee character because that was the meta, now melee is nerfed and no longer the meta, tell me how that's fucking fair?
---
My Instagram name is Wasteland_snaps: sign up, drop me a message to say you‚Äôre from reddit and I can send you lots of cool people to follow and interact with. Honestly everyone is just lovely and we all champion each other‚Äôs work. 
---
Dodgy as well. where'd you find that info?
---
I first suspected it applied in layers, but someone pointed out a dev note/post somewhere about the 95% cap and my numbers started matching up. (can't tell if its truncating or rounding, as only whole numbers are reported)
---
Once I have stuff to give away, junk, canned food, water, ammo, etc, I fast travel to Vault 76 and walk the path new players will take.
---
I drop some stuff at the little camp just down the hill, I put stuff in the tool box by the lumber truck, and the tool box at the overseers camp, back of the pickup on the way to town, mailboxes, and the cash register/first aid kit in the church. Most of those boxes only hold 10 lbs. so I can't load them down but it does give that extra little push sometimes needed without teaching new players horrible STASH management skills.
---
Is it all of your weapons or just a certain one? If it's been happening from lvl1-30 than you definitely have a problem. Create a 2nd character to see if it works. You may have try completely uninstalling your game. 
---
Bad attempt. Went too far with the embellishment.
---
have you tried server hopping?
---
How many points in agility do you have, also what weapon?
---
yea thats probably what happened
---
&gt;or just listing out all the fucking quests you clearly don't give a shit about
---
Yes, the Minuteman telling you to nuke the Enclave and the Brotherhood telling you to nuke the Enclave, both quests requiring you to fight your way in and reach an spot inside the Enclave is a *MASSSIVE difference!!!!!*
---
&gt;You're part of the cult of people who are super ok with RPG's not having RPG elements, like "fucking quests" and I'm part of the group of people who loathe this fucking slide away from actual gameplay in exchange for "making your own fun".
---
Again, there are fucking quests.  What they are not doing is handing you every fucking side quest on a silver platter.
---
&gt;but saying that it's "better" not to have quests that send you to interesting places and have you do interesting things for interesting rewards is fucking insane to me.
---
Pssst.....didja notice I never used the word "better"?  They are *different*.  That's it.
---
You are demanding that the game give you a quest marker over the interesting places.  That's a Theme Park RPG.  In an Open World RPG they create that interesting place, and leave it up to you to find the interesting places and quests therein.
---
They're both RPGs and both have advantages and disadvantages.  
---
Like, why the fuck did those urchins travel to the town and then sit on their ass waiting for me to arrive?  Why did they think I'd be helpful at all?  I'm a random stranger who probably doesn't look all that different than anyone else.   
---
 I've also got a mission to save the fucking world, so why should I be receptive to them asking me to stop that and gather rabbit hides for their grandma?  Kinda damages the suspension of disbelief.
---
OTOH, I'm beaten over the head with their existence, so I don't miss out on an "interesting place" if I don't happen to wander over to it.
---
I'm not saying PvP isn't fucked up, just trying to explain why everyone jumps in competitive online games
---
I just watched it again. One of the developers said that they allowed high level players into survival mode  to see all the ways could break it with legendary gear so the could make adjustments. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfyViQ9Uo\_M&amp;t=2520s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfyViQ9Uo_M&amp;t=2520s) 
---
There's plenty of servers, you're looking at it wrong. An online games when you go to join a game it looks that you're peeing and other statistics and put you into the best match. If you leave and re-enter you may re-enter the exact same one you were just in. The only way to tell is to look around and see the names on the map or loot some wood or a container nearby and if it's empty again you've already been there.
---
I've had this happen a bunch of times.
---
Personally the weapon they're doing this week and most of the ones they're doing are pure crap. If you really need legendaries with a couple of stars on them just head down to watoga and run around with a sledgehammer.
---
https://youtu.be/tkgl6CKWXWM
---
I believe it was in this video. If not let me know and I'll look again. Sorry, at work and can't verify, but I'm fairly certain this is it.
---
ü¶É
---
Did you ever find out if Grenadier applies to weapons too?
---
Since Whitespring is officially becoming a hub to buy literally anything it would make sense for them to put in a shop where people can claim vending machines to sell their goods. Having that on top of a vending machine at your CAMP would be the best approach I can imagine. It'd also be neat to be able to build vendor bots in the future that can stay at camp or roam on routes we get to choose.

Darkdestory23

I have sentinel asassin armour and its nowhere near as effective as a high perception, bloodied sniper build in pvp. Vats heatshots ignore my armour. They can see me before i see them, I'm dead in 1 or 2 shots. In a couple months, survival is just going to be invisible snipers.
---
I was kinda pumped to try pvp. I'd never killed anyone in adventure mode but bought the armour to deal with guys wrecking my house. Now I'm only going in for the weekly gun challenge. 
---
&gt;There would have to be a downside.
---
Sure, make it so the planted mutated flora doesn't give flux. I would kinda hate it if harvesting what are supposed to be end-game materials became trivialized.
---
Benefits from Int max at 20. With 5 Int and a full set of unyielding you can hit that without using any consumables. The food is a fair point, but most people keep stocked up on food for the benefits that match their build, not just the strait healing/food value.
---
It's the same as on here, I haven't uploaded any of my fo76 shots in there yet, but I will for yah
---
This ^ is my number one, most hated behaviour in shooters. Hands down. 
---
Yeah it was definitely that. Not the lies, the scammy business tactics or the horribly bugged release.
---
Interesting... On PC there's an option to decline their request. 
---
You **may** have to first switch to the "View Offers" menu (or Offers Only, whatever it's called), but you can refuse w/o just closing the trade on them. 
---
Surely this *must* be on the console versions as well??
---
And in my two instances of ever trading with someone else other than a friend, as I recall it you select items you're interested in and then they in turn set the price after the fact. I don't recall the specifics of the first trade I made since it was a few months back (other than I bought a plan for the Marine wetsuit \[the 'tactical' underarmor\]), so I don't know what an *incoming* request looks like. On the other instance, the guy was offering Rad-X, which I wasn't interested in and so I simply declined the offer. 
---
I‚Äôve not seen a scorched beast fly backwards yet. What platform do you use if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? 
---
Grouping together icons that expand in a small window when you put the cursor over it would solve this issue. Much like how you can do app shortcuts on smartphones.
---
Nah, that group have shared their cap pool since launch. It just wasn't noticed for a while.
---
Rifle builds are viable if you also use VATS and crits, especially when you get a good gauss rifle. There are some good ideas on nukes and dragons, a build guid website. Also let's you lay out your perks and then see which ones you can swap in and out with your given score, very useful for guiding SPECIAL choices. Even let's you know which level the perks unlock at. Melee is a good choice though 
---
Hate to burst your bubble but Fo76 is pretty [MMORPG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) like...
---
Multiple online players? Yep
---
Role playing game? Yep
---
Social interaction encouraged? Yep
---
Progression and end game loot? Yep
---
Persistent online world? Yep
---
shhh don't want this fixed
---
yup, I love how BFFS made them bunnys
---
It was a quick fix, but after they kept coming back I just left the server.
---
On a more positive note, a level 60 or 70 player stopped by the camp, showed praise, shared some goods and on they went. There have been far more positive interactions than negative ones.
---
With fireproof they may as well be attacking you with wet farts. I just continue doing what I'm doing until I hear the "whoosh" that means I'm about to get some free ultracite.
---
Far too many toxic people these days for that to workout I'm afraid. 
---
 A survival based adventure mode I suggested not that long ago is what I had in mind as well:
---
 Remove any kind of slapping and have it be open PVP
---
Seriously increase the risk vs reward for being a wanted outlaw/bandit/raider. 
---
Absolutely no player map markers unless wanted
---
 Characters have to start and be locked to that mode so you can't level up on easy mode and switch to survival.
---
No leaderboards 
---
 Remove any kind of PVP buff on legendary effects.
---
Examples: two shot, bloodied, explosive
---
 Still leave legendaries in for PVE.
---
Examples: mutant and ghoul slayers 
---
 There are more rules that you could put in place but that would be my dream ideal survival server
---
Just a brunch of jokes :)
---
To holler people down from a distance?  
---
Roleplay?  
---
Simply something else to do?
---
Excellent toothpicks for your pet deathclaw. I dont know of any practical use beyond scrapping.
---
Yeah so definitely not my idea. XD
---
Yaowaaa420
---
And just because a camp is there doesn't mean the random encounter spawns are voided. Stuff still spawns it just doesn't spawn in its usual location. 
---
the first M in MMO stands for massive or massively, there are never more than a few dozen players in the same instance, which means it's not an MMO, and everything else you listed are just aspects of most online games, just because a game is played online doesn't mean it's an MMO.
---
Hey I've had my foundations disappear after a recent move so, its not like stranger things have happened.
---
Moved ten feet, went from 12 foundations to 3.... Lost my turrets,  (thankfully they weren't dead budget like what happened to me around launch) 
---
Half my walls, a bunch of conduit pieces and half the conduit pieces that stayed just refused to place. No warning about it floating or intersecting, just. Wouldn't. Place......I've sinced downsized to six foundation pieces.
---
At higher levels the super mutants seem to more consistently drop what they're actually carrying and then some. Scorched just... Never do. Their controllers make up for it by dropping an ocean of random weapons sometimes.
---
3 months later same shit.
---
The Institute. Not the enclave. 
---
You're completely ignoring MULTIPLE quests in the route to that end goal, those side quests which differ from faction to faction are my point, not the end goal. You are absolutely dead set on ignoring the major differences in the quest-lines to that "nuke the institute" ending, which...ok? Did you play the fucking game through with multiple factions? 
---
I posted a link to the "side quests" in this game, elsewhere in this thread.  The vast fucking majority of them are fetch quests or crafting quests that take one or two minutes, baring the mistress of mystery quest, the mayor for a day quest, the quest that gets you excvator armor. 
---
Where in 4, you have silver shroud, you have cabot house, hole in the wall, you have...there's quite a few fully fleshed out side quests which take you to multiple zones and have you do multiple things. 
---
Your implication that the system in 76 is so heavy handed I didn't think it actually needed saying. 
---
look, we're never going to agree on this, so let's drop it. I want RPG elements, you want a open world game without RPG elements. Good for you. 
---
Give me more money, you fascist bully boy. Boomshanka. 
---
Lol. All valid points. Bethesda certainly shot themselves in the foot, probably all the way up to their hip, with the release of '76. It'll certainly be given a much more critical response for any following game releases.
---
Dont know if im too late to help, but often ill see enemies bodies return to the location that they originally spawned. Its all pretty sloppy though
---
God I have been looking for something like this forever. People want to list plan individual prices, etc. There's too many and nobody has time for that! Everybody just throw their plans in a big pile and then take the ones they don't have! I'm totally down. I even got a couple rarer plans l will throw in. PSN AndrewMosier. 
---
hiss point remains, it is far from the "worse" food in the game...
---
Sort of like a flea market like where people bring their things to sell in a place they gather.
---
T-60 paint jobs come from turning in tech data and everybody's after it at the moment. It's likely that someone grabbed it already in that server.
---

Upvoting to spread April's first salt fall.
---
Your playing an online multiplayer game. If you think that they aren‚Äôt going to change with the passing of the moon. You need to have a hard look at the world your playing in. 
---
Also I was talking about a respec from level 1. Not sure where you got your response from. 
---
The fact that bloodied is one of if not the best effect to have right now is completely breaking your idea of nerfed melee. Maybe in survival that‚Äôs a different story. But most of the player base is still walking around adventure I‚Äôd wager. 
---
Yourbuils got nerfed? Tell me how metas actually work.
---
they have a powered/unpowered state, they show up on the map when you power them. go find the post by the data miner that popped up about a month ago. 
---
I wish they had used my guy's name, I'd have loved to hear John Cleese say 'Peter Stormare'
---
I could be wrong [probably], but I think it's part of the anti-server-hopping initiative that Bethesda is forcing on us. 
---
Take your time.  Go slow.  Stop and sniff the holotapes.
---
It‚Äôs worth getting, 90% of the shitty glitches are gone. The servers are stable and the stash limit is effectively double what it was to start with. Also yes the enemies do speak, the venders are the funny ones though ‚Äú please don‚Äôt stab customers while in the store‚Äù ‚Äúany five finger discounts will be paid with said fingers‚Äù
---
My guess is that people were looking for more avenues of entertainment after they plastered their 300+ hrs and had finished all the quests.
---
Yeah, I can see that. You can get the colours back on a freshly crafted piece; not much help if you have modded. 
---
I never kill them. I hide or run or die. Once I was drunk and started shooting my hunting rifle at it but then it ate me. Whatever.
---
T-60 has rather meh resistances, but it‚Äôs super cheap to repair. With max rank Power Patcher, I can fix a piece of T-60 for one steel, one plastic, and one aluminum (I think). It‚Äôs super easy to maintain through heavy use, and it‚Äôs resistance are good enough for most situations.
---
On top of all that, it‚Äôs super customizable. Mods are relatively easy to acquire and the BOS paints give it a lot of visual variety.
---
Yeah..I knowüòû I'm just too lazy to craft it again.üòñ
---
I am sure they thank you for making sure they rush through all the content and story as fast as possible so they can get to the real game: grinding whitesprings 8 hours a day looking for random drops to be 1% stronger so they can grind whitesprings more. 
---
True, but at least we know that there is a possibility of there being advanced human civilizations. 
---
Yeah that's my point. There is no upside using bloodied in survival but all of the downsides persist.
---
Servers hold up to 25 people and you can freely hop between them giving you access to thousands. You‚Äôre a weak troll at best lol
---
Indeed! And to avoid chaos the vending machines could just always be there and the one you claim can be skinned to stand out. I'd say give people 2x2 tile lots to work with but that could get ridiculous.
---
Thanks pal, adding you ingame. I'll patiently wait for one of those much needed booze bottles.
---
What you want for it? Can make lead champagne and its variants, lemonades and white russian, aside from the normal booze ofc. Or I can give you 50 caps if you want.
---
........... Or......... there's dilation bubble around Helvetia due to a space-time disturbance! O_O 
---
But yes, if it is a simulation I'd envision there's lots of external sensors collecting data that MODUS is monitoring, assuming it is a nuclear wasteland outside and we're not in a giant facility somewhere pre-war lol However, even considering the latter, I'd imagine in either case that variable would be constantly under adjustment and that's how new things (creatures) are added.
---
To touch on what someone else said about how the Mirelurk Queen would be something new that the pre-war scientists couldn't really predict for, that would be a tougher one to explain in the pre-war sim scenario. For the wasteland scenario, all one has to consider is external cameras that MODUS was either intentionally wired into, or that he hacked the feed for. 
---
Platform should be required for these types of posts...
---

---
Welcome! Best piece of advice is take your time explore everything and everywhere and don't be afraid to fail. The worst thing that can happen to you is you have to go back and look for your paper sack. Hang out with some more experienced people and learn the ropes and if you even ask nicely they may hook you up! Remember if what you're doing is not fun then chances are you're playing the game wrong.
---
Theres a boxcar West of Lewisburg train station that spawns confederate clothing.  I have picked up a tophat there before. I sold it at vendor because I don't collect.
---
Would be fun to have a National Broadcast Workshop you can claim. And play some music and talk in a new Radio and stuff. If you are a annoying troll, you just get nuked by players in Pvp haha.
---
I can‚Äôt believe people are still asking this, the game will never be perfect so you will be waiting forever for that perfect game that will never realise.
---
I‚Äôm guessing you are on console? If PC find a deal. I bought my copy for ¬£16 from a UK online key seller in Nov last year and have enjoyed months of entertainment, definitely worth it. 
---
I‚Äôve had my frustrations from the bugs and disconnections but all in all it‚Äôs been great fun üòé
---
I think you're indeed correct, as I had recollection of it, but I didn't want to assume that and look like a doofus! :P
---
Does the siren do this?
---
Perception
---
Sadly, no. But I wouldn't have been surprised with all the mystery ingredients food seems to have. This one is just mildly annoying to brew as it requires all common stuff, except for aster. Aster is just enough uncommon that I can never think of where I've seen it growing when I need to craft one for Biv. So I just carry 5 around with me in case I need one for his quests. But, for some reason, he keeps giving me the recipe over and over again.
---
I can definitely bring that up as well!
---
That is it, almost all the story content is front loaded. Twink someone up from level 60 to level 160 and that seems not bad, taking someone from 1 to 10 or something takes away literally the only part of the game with plot and frequent quests and meaningful quest rewards seems counterproductive. 
---
That‚Äôs an awesome pic. 
---
Thats would be a cool workshop to have yeah
---
Nice one that‚Äôs the way to do this üëç
---
FO76 isn't a MMO. Full Stop.
---
Just because you can connect to hundreds of different players doesn't make it an MMO. You can only see a couple dozen of players at once max. That would be like calling Call of duty Ground War matches an MMO.
---
I've tested endangerol on players, and there it does nothing. Tried testing on mobs; couldn't find a good mob/spot for repeated tests - but it didn't seem to work. Anyone know of a stationary, high level mob that spawns with the same level every time/often?
---
It's also been relocated--the actual Harpers Ferry is well east of the FO76 map, but they moved it so they could include it.  The real site is the extreme eastern end of the panhandle--about as far east as WV goes.  (Seriously, it's not quite on the FO3 map, but it's close!)
---
Thank you thank you! üôèüèª
---
That is what I like to go when I see a cool camp.  There are some pretty sweet bases out there for sure 
---
Know what man? You got a few upvotes for your moderately witty professional golfer reply, but you should have shut up at that point.
---
You're coming across like a complete arsehole now.
---
NOTE: NOT the OP.
---
Yeah, you're right. 
---
Platform required 
---
It's a known spot for TD's, so most likely someone else has beaten you there. A good sign is a lack of phone's ir fans on the desks too.
---
I can make the puncturing power fist but dont have the actual plan to give.
---
1) Adhesive is in the environment in many ways, - Duct Tape, Economy Wonder-glue, Military Duct Tape, Wonder Glue, Vegetable Starch, and Home Made glue, all scrap down to adhesive.
---
Some people even build an "Adhesive Farm" at their CAMP - Plant Corn, Mutifriut, Tatos, combine with Purified Water at CAMP stove/cooking and create Vegetable Starch then scrap 
---
2) CAMPS help in many ways, they are free fast travel location, allow you to have all workbenches in one location (other than WhiteSprings) and add your own decorum. 
---
3) Sorry on different Platform, otherwise would!
---
Doesn't simply locking your doors serve this purpose, at least for you and your party? I guess someone could still break in though if they wanted to and had the lockpick perks to do it.
---
1) A great way to get adhesive is to grow corn, tato, and mutfruit along with farming purified water. You can cook it down in a cook stove to make vegetable starch which scraps to adhesive.
---
2) Do you want your camp to be and a pretty location or are you looking for scrap. If you want scrap you can Google "fo76 resources extractor location" and you will get a map with all extractors marked. When it comes to pretty camp locations choose a region you like and decided if you want to live in hills, river, road, etc.
---
Hope that helps, if you have any other questions just feel free to ask.
---
Mudfruit + corn + tato can be crafted into vegetable starch, which scraps to adhesive. Plant some of each at your camp, and you'll have some extra adhesive to work with.
---
Yes, they are aware of that one and investigating it.
---
I think you should asking if they could make more underarmor, or the suit work as  underarmor, outfits are meant to be worn over the armor
---
Their rewards are still pretty lackluster. I've stopped just giving up on the fights now that they don't blast their sonic attack *constantly* but they still don't feel worth the effort, especially since they still rarely land.
---
GT? I can help you out with some supplies
---
Pretty sure a high-level deathclaw is at the thunderstation above watoga. 
---
I mean, you could wait until you see someone in 76 (and it takes like 20 minutes to make your character/figure out what's going on when you're level 1) so you FT to 76 and drop some good modded level 1 armor, diluted stims and radaway, food and water.
---
then hop above and wait chameleon-style for them to come out and discover the bag. watch them load up and run off into the forest. and maybe stealth snipe a couple liberators for them.
---
you \_could\_ do these things, if you were some sort of weirdo.
---
Read the [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) full stop. It falls under the definition in every way possible. Nice try though!
---
He deleted the embellishment üòÇ
---
I don't believe so. I'm just tired of not knowing a creature or person is destroying my base
---
Grinding end game content to become a tiny bit stronger is a big part of MMORPGs, it's not the only part, but it's a big part. Just because the only thing you can think to do at high levels is derp around Whitesprings, doesn't mean that's the only reason to rush to high levels.

Why wait? Come on in!!  The water is fine.  Unless its dirty, or toxic, sometimes purified, mostly just dirty.  Just boil it though and its all good!!
---
the wasteland awaits my friend!!
---
I've went back to half my base wrecked once in a few weeks. Other wise no real enemies have spawned on me. Food is the most annoying, since we cant stockpile for when it gets wrecked. 
---
I figured theyd just have a 'Vendor Terminal' type thing to add to your camp. Anyone who has said terminal in their camp can browse it to see the other peoples items for sale on the server. I like being forced to travel to other peoples camps better though, Id like to see their creations.
---
When I get home I'll make a list, sure

Most people don't deal with this too often, so glad you brought it up.  I luckily found it out after I painted a 10mm pistol the tricentennial paint a long time ago.  Thought I lost my shotty this past weekend selling loot till I remembered the skin I had just put on it.
---
Not a cat owner... they were eating them, hence the lobster traps
---
The different barrels turn the syringer ammo into the different kinds of syringes (weird mechanic, but probably just easier that way for the scrap-to-learn mechanics).
---
You have not.
---
But with an attitude like that, I hope that you don't ruin the rest of your life.
---
Best of luck. Karma's a bitch.

I was under the impression that, thats where the legendary vendor will be
---
I (level 24) had this happen to me the other day. I was exploring the Ash Heap and a level 70 came out of no where and saved my ass while I was being chased by ghouls. Didn't really think much of it.
---
He then pops back up and tried to trade with me. I've never done it before so I screwed it up. I decided to drop a few things like a fusion core, pulse grenades and some radaway as thanks for taking out the ghouls. He proceeds to drop like 40 stimpacks, a bunch of plans, a moleman gauntlet and some other things. I'm pretty happy with that.
---
Next he sends me a request to join his party so I accept. He then goes and claims the workshop at the asheap. I'm putzing around gathering ash trays and stupid crap and realize oooo he took the workshop...maybe I'll check it out. 
---
Once I get there we are immediately attacked by a scorch beast! I'm losing my shit because it's my first fight with one but thankfully I had a PA chassis. I ran around like an idiot and tried to fix some turrets. I shot him as much as I could but my teammate did the most damage. It was nuts and the most fun I've had yet!
---
üòÇüòÇ I couldn't resist
---
How‚Äôs that unruly golfer thing going, then?
---
Your specials in the stats screen are overall attributes. These affect exactly what is listed when you hover over them. These DO NOT affect perk point placement, but ARE affected by perk point placement.
---
 Your perks max out at 15 per special allowing 15 points at max to be placed there. These perk points cause your special stats to be higher, like said above.
---
Mate I don't need to read what an MMO means. Massive = a large amount. By your definition any game that has a matchmaking service is now an MMO. 
---
CoD is now an MMO, Battlefield is now an MMO. Hearthstone is now an MMO. Just because you can connect to hundreds of other players via a matchmaking service does not mean it's an MMO. The average games that have multiplayer support around 4-12 players. Back in the day CoD supported 18 players in ground war. Battlefield supports at least 64 players. None of these games are MMOs, nor is FO76
---
I think when raids actually drop structured social play will be on the uptick again.
---
I do the same with scorched beast queen camps make her land on the ground for shorter periods of time. I feel bad but hopefully one day they move
---
Just be careful. I tried to drop a painted 2shot .44 and the pop up about destroying it came up. I thought it would destroy the paint job and drop but it flat out destroyed the gun entirely ü§¨
---
I walk the roads everywhere.  And by walk I mean caps lock on and sloooow walk.  I even limit my load to a couple meds and maybe a disease cure.  I scrounge and scrap for everything from armor fixes to ammo I need along the journey.  Drinking dirty water makes it a gamble.  I‚Äôve even happened upon plates of spoiled food that I glance side to side to make sure no one sees me eat it.  It‚Äôs very immersive and I have time to take in all the sights and sounds
---
Agreed, found that out the hard way. Wishing I had waited till 50 just for the Sommerset Special.
---
You are welcome and yes, that was a fun gun fight! I am just glad that some people are paying attention and the fights are thus becoming more tense and drawn out. I hope they find a way to fix this though, I don‚Äôt like having to constantly spam my armor on and off Incase of some new player wondering into the fight.
---
I was as well. Have a friend helping me out with a jetpack when he comes back on later. I'm now just curious if the weapons in the robo cage are interactable or not. 
---
I can't wait to open my bar!  Still gathering recipes but have almost unlocked all of them from Biv's daily.
---
Learn the mechanics and follow the main quest line at the start.  By level 20 you should have decent idea of how things work.  Remember you have stash boxes at each train station, and your camp and you should store junk items in those to avoid losing your junk when you die.  Other than that death is not a big deal, its mostly just annoying.  You can get wanted status unintentionally by    picking locks at a workshop or campsite owned by someone else so keep an eye on that.  You may want to go ahead and set your pacifist flag to on to avoid giving someone an excuse to attack you because you inadvertently damaged them.  Explore and have fun.
---
Any idea where I can find some to plant??
---
The highest I have gotten for that one was in the 70s, 78, I think.
---
I can make you one, but I'm not gonna be online for a few more hours.  If you still don't have one in three hours or so let me know!
---
I have been hopping at one of the other spawn locations and have seen him 4 times in the past hour. There are other places. You don‚Äôt have to be that guy. 
---
You can craft the mainframe cores bht you need to have certaine materials u get from robots, if u need help ans on ps4 just ask
---
Be nice to see other peoples stuff, mines pretty generic xD. Like a Square house, I moved so just a room with a crafting area, small hallway with stairs going to my living quarters on 2nd floor. Thats about it. Outdoor patio using the grass type floor xD.
---
Go to the fort defiance and get all the straight jackets.  Server hop and do it again. You can find about 15 or so(guessing). And with 15 or 20 charisma, you can sell them for 50 a piece or so.  This is the simplest and most straight forward cap grind I can think of. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to hop servers. You can go get golf outfits from white springs and more straight jackets at the prison. 
---
Or go kill another player and bulk all his junk (this can sometimes be the fastest but riskiest option depending on lobby and if you have plastic) 
---
Gary in Grafton has excavator plans/mods
---
Huh? Wait?  Go for it, do it now.
---
It adds to the fun. Just watch where you shoot or swing. I do believe inside of the resort should be a no fight zone. 
---
Yep, last time it was an albino. Most of the time theyre glowing though.
---
The idea of a lvl 50 sommerset has made me consider power leveling a Vats crit pistol build several times. I'm just not sure how pistol builds would fair against SBs, or other big beefy fucks. 
---
My group kills her 2-3 times a night during the week. Absolutely no problem at all. Tse are garbage against her. It takes between 4-9 minutes to kill her if you do it right. Spend the time to prepare and equip the right perks before fighting her. 
---
If you would read the wiki, you‚Äôd know that by my definition the multiple players is only ONE aspect of a MMORPG, I won‚Äôt talk any more since you choose to live in ignorance about the accepted and posted definition. 
---
I also take photos of all these scenes Bethesda set up. I love them.  My favorite is one on top of a mansion with a skeleton couple in the chair hugging each other. There is a message spelled out next to them in letter blocks. But I can‚Äôt remember the message 
---
Also at that house on the balcony there is a red tricycle with the word ‚Äúredrum‚Äù spelled next to it  
---
Yeah lol our team was sitting on a ridge line trying to kill one guy with a Gatling gun and he was just picking us apart with expert accuracy from stupidly far away. This is when we figured something was very wrong.

I want to know them!

This is the definition of an MMO "A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG, or more commonly, MMO) is an online game with large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, on the same server."

I've been stockpiling ammo of all types in preparation and expanding my razorgrain crop for alcohol production.  I've also moved up my camp near a train station so folks should be able to get to my place fairly easily.
---
For sure watching this after work. Thank you for sharing!
---
Scorchbeasts aren't that hard to take down at late-game, early, and mid-game, sure, but it does depend a lot on your build. If you're running any kind of crippling perk with a ranged weapon, all you need to do is clip their wings until they're forced to land, then they're a joke.  Sneak attack builds will destroy these things in record time.  I can see why melee fighters will probably hate them if they lack any crippling perks. 
---
Besides that, they don't really give great rewards though, that's kinda certain.  The only unique drops they provide are prime receiver plans, and small quantities of Ultracite from their bones or wings, but that's really it.
---
Server hop at the random event spawn at the overseers camp and look for the civil war top hat plan (or the confederate hat plan but that isn‚Äôt as good) and mass craft them, they require 1cloth but sell for about 8-30caps each depending on your charisma and perks. Very easy vendor cash (you can also buy bulk cloth at vendors, turn it into hats and sell it for a profit)
---
Electric guitar sword!
---
Whether he was a threat, a joke or simply a WTF nuisance I would urge you to report his ass and if the guys at BETH are watching DO SOMETHING about this shite! THIS is the one and only reason i have never bothered with on-line games because, sadly, people suck. Not all of them of course but it's a split paint kind of thing. No it's not the end of the world but a stain in the fabric of your experience can ruin the whole thing.  It brings out the ugly in me and I don't like that either.
---
I forgot their was other stuff to do with him! About how many total is there? 
---
Uhh....that would be me.  I love my chrome mini and have gotten many thumbs up compliments on it while in SBQ event.  Some  weapons also accept the tricentennial paint mod.
---
Sweet thanks. Kinda felt like that what it was doing in game. Although now I have a ts dragon I'm not sure what to do with haha

They are, and I love the game overall. PvP was never meant to be an integral part of the game, but that aspect attracted an entirely new fanbase. And Bethesda has been doing their best to make them feel included as well. I, as a long time Bethesda fan, appreciate that they are separating the two modes though. I don't mind a little casual PvP from time to time, but being harassed consistently takes away from my enjoyment and the immersion factor for me. I'm sure that I am not alone there.
---
Rare apparel 
---
Yeah, what on earth were they thinking with that? Did the one that designed the doors not notice and did nobody double-check?!
---
Yes. This works for orbital strikes. 
---
some rare outfits and camp plans
---
And you didn‚Äôt keep reading? Lol wow troll gtfo
---
Won‚Äôt the plans be gone from the vendor after server hopping for several hours? I‚Äôm not well versed on how this works. I have about 300 caps and need over 1000 caps to buy these plans 
---
Done and done. Thanks!
---
Thanks, I guess I am walking to Grafton tonight!!
---
Should be require for every post.  I know other game subs force you make a platform flair before posting 
---
Yes that's the spirit blame it on all the other players who showed up. 
---
The deliverer would be amazing. I wish they would just go down the simulation route so we can have more non canon stuff
---
What are the other spawn points? 
---
Use the search bar. I made a post about it earlier and a bunch of people responded. 
---
The ladder is true,stairs are a lie.Dont believe the hype.
---
I hate that this would for sure be exploited by smurf accounts. :(  
---
Very wholesome content, bud. Keep up the good work. 
---
I‚Äôll give that a try this afternoon. I doubt I‚Äôll be able to make the caps before the plans are gone from the vendor 
---
I dont do this but they can build wherever they like. You dont own the servers my dude.
---
No they don‚Äôt stack.
---
Ye Gary the responder vendor. From train station face Grafton walk I to city but go the the road on the left. He is in a building to left
---
Have you played that legendary challenge? To describe it as "just playing" instead of a "hellish and boring, albeit profitible, grind" is massively inaccurate. It's difficult, annoying, and boring. Not good challenge design at all.
---
Ok thanks 
---
Which part didn't I read mate? All criteria of a definition must be met to be something you want it to be. Hundreds of players are not on a single server thus it can't be an MMO.
---
Whatever vendor it‚Äôs at, it will spawn again at some point. If it‚Äôs not guaranteed every time then it usually is RNG with that particular vendor.  But I know after updates, they usually pop up more often. I‚Äôm not 100% on this and with your particular plan. But In all my experience. This has been the case for me. 
---
Foods everywhere. Meat spoils go get you some Salisbury steaks and you'll be set.
---
Wait so we‚Äôre giving you our spare plans for free so you can resell them?
---
I got a prime pipe receiver plan :| best drop yet
---
That‚Äôd be great man it‚Äôs Lebirty

I farm tech data almost daily, and resetting the tables is fairly easy enough. The game seems to keep tabs on the last number of objects you looted. While I don't know the exact number, for simplicity's sake, let's say this number is 100. Until you've successfully looted 100 additional containers the desks in White Springs will not respawn until they've been knocked off the list.
---
When I run out of desks, I go to other areas and loot everything for a while. Even if I don't need it, I grab anything and everything I can take because each time you loot something it pushes down the list of items on the loot table. After 3-4 locations, I'll swap servers, go back to White Springs, and usually the desks will have started spawning again.
---
Cheesing? Never heard that before.
---
I've done the same, popped a stealthboy and hid under an overpass or behind a door, but they still hunted me down anyway. I just wanted the damned junk extractors af the Charleston Junkyard for a few minutes. I would have even given the workshop to someone, fully built and defended (I have blueprints for a workshop building with all the crafting tables and turrets up top, and the turret towers, so I can just plop everything down. Takes maybe a minute and a half as long as I have the necessary junk)
---
I have two characters.
---
The first is Peter Stormare, who I've played since launch and is level 121. never knew about builds when I started so He is a bit of a mess.
---
The second is Sam Beckett, the perpetual Level 2.
---
Every time I use Sam he looks different, gender, age, skin color, weight, height. He always looks like someone else when I use him.
---
I grind away at the challenges for leveling and stuff and then Sam is whisked away. hoping the next leap will be his leap home.
---
^I ^literally ^just ^delete ^sam ^and ^make ^a ^new ^sam ^every ^time.
---
It definitely would be
---
OMG this would be /so/ helpful! üòÅ
---
It would be nice if you could scrap explosives as well for mats to make ammo. Such as a missle. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the exact total, maybe 20 other hard liquors, beers or cocktails?
---
I know..
---
I am obviously going to be cooking said meat. That said, any ideas where good hunting areas are? It could be for anything, Radstag, wolf etc.
---
Level 5 GUNSMITH
---
Yeah I've done my share of good deeds.  Just cashing in now.   ;)
---
I dont really bother to aproach those challanges, I dont even find those alcohols usefull anyway. Prefer food for stats boost.
---
Saw a recent interview where the developers talked about why existing characters were allowed into survival mode.  He said it was because he wanted to see how many ways people could break the game with OP legendary gear so that it could be "Fixed." 
---
People need to learn that Charleston is the WORST place to spawn that vendor. Jeez. All this because that is where some early players encountered him first, so now everyone looks there.
---
changed with the last patch, i used to do this as well
---
jumping and just attacking works tho
---
I think he's roleplaying
---
You on PC young blood?
---
Taking workshops can get you a lot of food when you have to defend them. Pair that with the salt perk that makes food spoil slower and you‚Äôll be all set.  Also use the perk super duper when you cook it. Even when it‚Äôs just mole rats or rad rats you get alllllot Of meat to cook.
---
Another option is to grow mutfruit and tatos, use green thumb and make sweet tato stew
---
3rd option. Find the mothman shrine Way west of v76 and cook the eggs into omelettes you get about 40 every time and if you cook them with super duper probably a lot more
---
This one was accessible, but you're going to eat a lot of turret fire and his bloody explosive weapons when you come through the door.
---
I fully understand how he got to over 5hrs without dying while holed up in there.
---
You about gave me a heart attack! The spot is not blocked because of an update, it's only blocked because someone else already had a camp there.
---
I would be a bit more precise in word choice next time. ;)
---
I'd rather they didnt build behind the building at whitesprings
---
Simple. Until Bethesda fixes, if you are selling DON‚ÄôT join someone, make them come to you. 
---
Thanks for your help. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have to pass on it for now. It‚Äôs at Welch station 
---
Seems like leftovers from Fallout 4
---
the PU one was the only time I've seen anything spelt with them haha the redrum one feels extra spooky lol
---
Well, with no pistol perks a hardened non legendary revolver does about 100 damage for me, so I would imagine completely viable. The small difference in damage would be offset by the increased shots in VATS, and increased potential for crits. You make me want to do a build now lol. We could level them together üòÇüòÇüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have countless extra plans if you can give me cloth you can take whatever plans you want or need
---
For everyone looking for a chainsaw spawn point, you can find one at the Ranger District Office in the cage shed which is north of Watoga.
---
Exactly! Only carry my All Rise because it weighs nothing, the rocket exhaust noise is annoying anyway.  With the perks I run, I get more than sufficient damage from my 3 Grogs, just wish they would fix the favorites wheel from switching them all around and dropping 2 off everytime I log in.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen every once in a while off glowing ones at whitesprings, it‚Äôs always been with testa rifles.  I usually just make the joke that I hit the guy so had the legendary fell off him ;) 
---
so exactly what time are you spending? my Gauss Rifle takes out scorch beasts in a few hits at most, and 3 2mm cartridges are worth the loot they drop for sure.
---
Pvp is populated by lots of players that are taking what they know of pve and thinking it applies and  a smaller subset that have figured out that everything is different and are using it to their advantage.
---
Crafty, sir.  Crafty
---
Lol, troll
---
Cringy old meme 0/10 not good. Next Meme
---
To make Bulk Steel you need:
---
 30x Steel Scrap
---
 2x Molded Plastic
---
Steel Scrap = 0.03
---
Molded Plastic = 0.03
---
32 x 0.03 = 0.96
---
Bulk Steel = 0.75
---
Granted, you lose the Molded Plastic (I assume) after breaking the Bulk Steel back down, but upon crafting it's still technically gained space, thus why I used 32 instead of 30 (as they both weigh the same, simplifying the calculation). 
---
That said, I had mentioned if you have a lot like I had (roughly 300 Steel Scrap), you could gain upwards of 5lbs in your Stash. In THIS equation I'll not bother with the molded plastic...
---
300 x 0.03 = 9, therefore I had 9lbs of steel.
---
300 √∑ 30 = 10, which is how many Bulk Steel I can make. 
---
10 \* 0.75 = 7.5, meaning the Bulk Steel weighs 7.5lbs.
---
9 - 7.5 = 2.5, which means you save 2.5lbs of stash space by converting to Bulk. 
---
I was off, I admit, but the important thing is that it **does not** equal what you put in anymore! :)  
---
When it comes to Stash space, 2.5lbs is meaningful. Could be the difference between being able to add a new piece of armor or not. heh
---
Was this nephew such a shit troll that they actually deleted their account?
---
Or did Reddit change how that works now? Because it‚Äôs showing [deleted] for the username for me
---
Aww man, this was my greatest fear!
---
It was so fun to fly up the wall and hit them though, so superhero, now it‚Äôs just me jumping up and down trying to get the timing right and failing :( 
---
servers hold 24 not 25.
---
No more Shoryuken'ing turrets. The pathing for the teleport requires you to be on the ground for the hit now. I learned this last night solo'ing a nuke silo.
---
Oh gosh. I'll need to visit him days I play I suppose
---
 Thanks! 
---
Wouldn't be so bad if we had a Dragonrend equivalent
---
have you considered... just telling them it's not for sale over microphone?
---
its actually in the data.
---
[https://imgur.com/NC2NDEM](https://imgur.com/NC2NDEM)
---
Yes that's correct. Good catch. I had forgotten that tidbit.  It was a long time ago on the first pistol I modded. 
---
I've actually had random items seemingly fall out of my own chest. On one occasion, I logged in, and the game spawned me dangerously close to the cliff edge where my camp was located, and while panning the camera around myself, what seemed like a camp unit fell out of me and down the cliff. Another time, I was just walking and a connecting rod spontaneously appeared in the air in front of me at about eye height, and then fell to the ground.
---
You could give them for free, you could trade for ones you don't have, or I'll pay you some caps for them. Whatever works. Like I said, I'm not looking to make money, just to make everyone's camps look a little better! The money I have made, I spend on random already known plans so I can re-sell them at a discount. For example, I ran into Graham twice yesterday and bought two mirror disco balls and two fusion generators even though I already had these. They cost me about 197 caps each, but I'm reselling them for 50 caps probably (or free) just for the hell of it. 
---
Did you register yourself in to the crypto‚Äôs computer as a new user? 
---
I ususally use them for Restore Stamina potions but they can be used to make Fortify Heath and Fortify One-Handed potions as well.
---
Yea, strip off the armor pieces and add claim the PA frame.  Then re-add the armor pieces to the frame.  You can't climb back into the frame, but if you wait for the auto return timer, it'll be added back to your inventory, and only take up the weight of the frame, and not the frame and all the parts separately. 
---

---
How are you getting ultracite passively? Scorchbeasts nuke my turrets
---
Yeah I moved my CAMP right outside Morgantown and have been visiting him every day.  Have also been stockpiling all the booze I run across, and crafting a lot more.  Should have quite the selection once player vending starts!
---
I want to see new factions enter Appalachia! It would be really interesting to add more human drama to the story. With things like:
---
\-Raider patrols
---
\-Responder missions
---
\-BOS quests 
---
\-Non-feral ghouls
---
\-Enclave
---
\-Traders
---
\-Settlers
---
So many different directions to take the story!
---
I mean to proc to this point I had to, their are NO options on the computer...
---
Trust me. I was very precise with my words. It is a different message than a player has already occupied this. It legit said a Fallout 76 update has prevented you some place in your camp.
---
I think I figured out what the issue is. When you go to place your camp there's a red wall around the areas you can't place it in. Well I placed my base right outside that area, but ended up building the base inside of some of it.
---
Bro you better invest in condoms and netflix
---
I tried camping next to one but man it was neverending. Every few minutes a new one would pop out
---
I started playing half-life in 1998 when I was 2-3 years old, good times.
---
Yeah not disagreeing but if I could scrap ammo, I could also convert the metric ton of .38 and 10mm into something useful like .50 cal or .308.
---
Even worse is when you, as a melee build, have to fight one or take down a frigging cargo bot. So annoying
---
I tend to walk everywhere as well, rather not spend my precious caps on fast traveling. When I got home from work last night I decided to hit two spots I haven‚Äôt been in a while those being the Ingram Mansion and Atlas Observatory both were great loot wise. Plans for BOS combat armor arms at Ingram Mansion  as well as 3 legendary Colonel Gutsys at Atlas one dropped a 2 star quad pump shotgun and one dropped a 3star sentinel robot arm. 
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Bulked and sold, sorry.  I usually keep myself supplied with periodic runs through Whitespring, I can give you a breakdown of where to look/what to look for if that would be helpful.  It's not a ton, but it adds up over time.
---
&gt; Who else goes to Welsh just to ~~see~~ stomp the fuck out of Murgle?
---
Damn right I do
---
Yeah nice! I could use some inspiration haha
---
you can find bottles of glue everywhere in the game. If you scrap duct tape and ballistic tape you will get adhesive. If you have the plans to cook vegetable starch. Grow the plants at you home. Then scrap the vegetable starch to get (2) adhesives per vegetable starch. 
---
As for a home. It is worth your time to make on. If you build it in the middle of an area that you are completing quests. You can save caps fast traveling. Just jump to your camp for free then on to your destination for less caps than you would spend going across the map. As for which locations are the best. It all depends on what are doing or what you need. Check out the enemies in the area because they will be the ones attacking your home. The tougher they are, the tougher they are going to be on your home. Turrets are nice for enemies at close range. Scorched and super mutants are snipers. Mole rats and ticks will chewy holes into anything. 
---
While you can find crafting benches all over. I find it nice to go home and have the one I need available right away. Instead of have to remember where I seen that work bench. 
---
If your needs change or you don't like the location any more. Just place the whole home somewhere new. Everything in the home will be where you placed it. Anything outside the home will have to be placed somewhere new. Which great because the new area around the home. 
---
Awesome! Thanks man! I'll be on later tonight and most evenings throughout the week (eastern time). And feel free to request any plans you don't already have, on the house!
---
Just the ability to scrap anything in the ammo section. I don‚Äôt use power armor and I‚Äôd love to scrap fusion cores. 
---
First thing you have to do is cripple a wing. Just cripple one and then the SB will land, and it's gravy from there. As far as the mobs go, nothing it spawns should be too hard. I use Gun Fu and Adrenaline, target the heads and everything goes down in one shot. Hell, I even keep a few alive so I can kill it, proc a crit with the luck perk (can't remember the name) and use the crit on the SB. Fight takes maybe 3-5 minutes.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox so this may or may not work, had a similar bug with the crypto‚Äôs comp- untagged the mission, did a few other things and came back a day or so later and it was working... 
---
No real help there I guess but it‚Äôs worth a shot
---
you can easily tell what mode someone is in by the icon to the left of their name when you try to join them. campfire = survival, nothing = adventure.
---
I always loot immediately after killing, if my health is low I eat what I killed 
---
My understanding is they will only be immune to damage while the player is not hostile to you. They will still be vunerable if they flag hostile 
---
I would guess it immediately gets credited to your "account".
---
Hunger and thirst were annoying in the first bunch of levels. A big help is to:
---
\- Build a basic camp with a hand water pump and a cooking station.
---
\- Cook animals you kill.
---
\- Get corn and fertilizer from the farms south east of Flatwoods.
---
\- Plant it at you camp and make corn soup.
---
\- Follow the main questline until you get the plans for a small water purifier.
---
That makes life easier for many, many levels.
---
On when u are bud
---
Well, I should have seen that coming.
---
No my dude. There's an uncommon glitch that happens, oh, maybe 1 every 100 legendaries or so when the mob 'drops' their legendary spawn instead of keeping it on their corpse. I've had feral ghouls drop missile launchers and protectrons drop laser pistols (especially fun when they explode and their drop gets blown away). This is part of the reason why some folks think legendaries don't drop legendaries  - because they _do_ only literally. (Also yes because syringers and drills are in their loot table and those weapons don't have legendary variants.)
---
it took a long time for ESO to even become worth playing... Even now though, it's not like the full elder scrolls experience, unlike fo76 which is the full fallout experience in a multiplayer shell.
---
Lol wut are u smoking
---
Pick up every clipboard, fan, and typewriter you come across. You'll eventually need all those screws and springs.
---
If you're playing normal Adventure mode, high level people are way more likely to gift you items than attack you. So don't run away. Look for brown paper bags at people's feet for items they drop for you.
---
If you're on the box, I have a few extras
---
2nd one today god heck it
---
Not all multiplayer games are mmos for fucks sake, and just because it‚Äôs an  rpg doesn‚Äôt change that fact. There‚Äôs a big difference between ‚Äúwow‚Äù which is the definition of mmo and fo76. 
---
I guess I‚Äôll spam 1 a bunch of times to charge up my medium attack, press 2, that adds a debuff and allows the ability tied to 4 to be more effective, then I press 5 for an aoe heal and buff and go back to pressing 1 for my basic attacking, repeat for 15 minutes without moving my character.
---
It‚Äôs typical reddit bs to dump all over this guy to the point he is deleting his stuff. Get over yourselves.
---
My very real yelp of anger and amusement &lt;3
---
Ill give it a go, everytime I log it says to listen to the holotape again... It's weird
---
Very strange, because I just logged in (from remote desktop from work), and checked, and was able to log into my camp to the left of the covered bridge next to the creek. (To the left of the bridge, if you're looking from the Overseer's Camp)
---
Really interested to see how this works out!  I've been stockpiling quality end game items and quality noob gear. Between this and the legendary vendor it should be pretty awesome!
---
I thought I read something about robot vendors in Whitesprings being able to accept all your daily caps??
---
Hopefully they change the spawn point inside the lobby and allow us to place vending machines there!
---
Massive? Nope...
---
24 players per server ain't an MMO. 
---
wastelanders will be adding new factions.
---
Have you been playing since beta? I‚Äôve had issues with this too, was a lvl 150 and didn‚Äôt eat the lvl 10 trophy till I made a second character the other day, it may not count all the terminals you hacked since then ?
---
Lol. Nobody will spend more money for this game. They made a unfinished game. We pay for it already. They need to finish their game.
---
God forbid someone equates ‚Äúmob‚Äù with getting mobbed which is a common use of that phrase.
---
Because the outfits are just cosmetic and I have my underarm or clipping through my radstag hide outfit anyway, I kinda wished the outfits gave you the choice of over or under.
---
The actual under*armor* has stats and can be upgraded, I would understand not adding in more atm. But outfits are just there to help dress up your toon, it would be nice to just visually make your armor pieces appear on top of that nice tan suit.
---
Really give you that 'lived in the apocalypse' feeling.
---
I got mine, but I can't part ways with my beer helmet. I've had it on since Lvl. 2. 
---
Sounds cool
---
There's tatos at the moonshine shack and flatwoods, mutfruit in flatwoods and the surrounding areas, go west of flatwoods and south following the road to billings homestead for corn, and razorgrain, loads of it. Green thumb perk helps
---
hahahaha
---
minigun should be an endgame weapon but man they sure didn‚Äôt want it to rock as it should. The damage was like 18 or something before. I read they have buffed it in the latest patch so maybe it‚Äôs time to dust off mine and give it a try üëçüèªüëçüèª 
---
Material, like for PA repairs and maintenance.  isn't ultracite difficult to obtain? I have the PA set. I've just left it in storage so far in lieu of the X-01. 
---
This upcoming or next week‚Äôs?
---
Rabbit Season!
---
I like survival mode fast travel better you cant jump from place to place so I save caps and find good loot!
---
Go to the Investigator's Cabin then walk south. Lots of animals.
---
Oh man, I got that done within a week of launch, thank goodness. 
---
I'd love to see a list. I reckon it wouldn't be long.
---
You've got no dignity, no class and no clue, is your issue.
---
And I'm done with you.
---
you won't be able to do crap when they make camp damage 0. lmao
---
I couldn't agree more man, this games seriously lacking in character flair, which we all know is the REAL ENDGAME of any multiplayer game in existence lol
---
Put on calibrated shocks on both legs, and your bonus carry weight is 200 on startup/server hop. Bracers for your arms at 10 carry weight too. Currently starting with 566 carry weight. Get killed, down to 466. No power armour, but pocketed leather armor and carry weight goes to 281. I live in my excavator.
---
Ok I‚Äôm on now, TSDante40k drop me an invite and meet at 76?
---
The rewards suck..agreed
---
I have quite a few I‚Äôll trade. Psn - brm138
---
If you happen to be on Xbox I'll buy the plans for 3.5k presuming you haven't used them 
---
Ya, I get that with non legendary dropping multi star loot sometimes. It usually happens in Whitesprings after the nuke dissipates and there are still glowing ones around.
---
Whitesprings. The TSE owners worst nightmare.
---
But why would I want to look like one of the Mackenzie brothers?
---
There's more bugs than features in this game. 
---
I'd like to think if I did that, I wouldn't have got crossing the border.
---
Limbs ? I just read post n went to check n I got the limbs I‚Äôll keep server hopping n try n get another 
---
Each point in str adds \~7% damage I noticed (melee). Affects carry weight too (+10 a point). Intel affects xp and amount you get back scrapping, durability of items you craft, ect..
---
This coming thursday's inside the vault will more than likely be about player vending.
---
Step 1 - Enter Survival
---
Step 2 - Murder everyone
---
Seriously... I have 73k muled in a few sessions since the new game mode launched. That doesn't count the 10k or so I made last night because I went to bed after my client chainsawed. I might be close to 4 maxed out mules by tonight. That doesn't count the massive stacks of aid I muled because I couldn't sell any more.
---
People bitched for months about getting disconnected and not being able to re-join a server. Now they bitch about the opposite. Lol!
---
I've been considering going back to excavator just for the carry capacity. I wonder if the hit to armor from the X-01 would be worth it
---
I run the perk ‚ÄúCan Do!‚Äù in luck. Searching certain garbage cans, refrigerators, coolers, etc. nets you a canned good. I‚Äôve done this since I was a low level and never ran out of food. Plus it never spoils.
---
Not a robot... the legendary vendor is a Mole-miner.
---
Preach brother, I've been playing fashion souls since I could crawl. Who care if that armor gives you the best stats, if it doesn't look aesthetically pleasing to you.
---
its the names codsworth can say in fallout 4 so if its one of these they can say it https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Codsworth/recognized_names
---
Yep, as soon as we get to start decorating our camp with stuff from our stash my shop is going to have crap lining the shelves as well.  It's gonna be so cash.
---
I‚Äôm not strong enough for that. I have crap armor and crap weapons. I‚Äôm working on improving that so I can try survival eventually. 
---
This sounds super interesting
---
Thanks for commenting this--I thought I was remembering crazy things and that it never worked but with muscle memory I kept trying.
---
One time when I was in the military I donated blood.    Got me out of work for the day and a free cookie.   Another time I folded someone else's laundry before putting mine in the communal dryer.  The list of such grand achievements goes on and on.  Not to mention my extreme modesty and good looks.
---
No, I had to work every beta test so didn't get in. Been playing seriously almost 2 months, completely addicted! But this is annoying. 
---
Yes
---
Ok I just found arms I‚Äôll keep trying 
---
The year 2007 called, they want their tired joke back...
---
Also if you want to maximize your adhesive farm while minimizing your CAMP plant footprint it's best to pick up Green Thumb and Super Duper perks.
---
Wow, I had no idea Bubbles even existed, and I'm level 111.
---
Actually, unless it‚Äôs a bug that was fixed, that worked for my daughter and I. Test it out by looking at your rifle‚Äôs dmg before and after 
---
I think you should be able to make oil into plastic. There are definitely a few items in the game that are such a pain to make.
---
Huh. I'd removed my Custom. INI and deleted my 1 mod (better inventory) on the last update cos I kept falling through the ground. 
---
Wait nvm I did find it again , you sure it‚Äôs not a set location ? 
---
I forgot about that. Yeah so will mine. I'll probably explore a day and collect all the bears and board games. Heres to hoping we can make our bases indestructable at some point. The rebuilding everything will be anoyying if we gotta repair junk too!
---
Well the straight jacket idea I saw above works too. You can also trade for the Marine Tactical Helmet plan and make those every day to sell to all 7 vendors. I think there are also some Civil War hat plans that work the same way. They are cheap in mats to craft and worth a lot of caps.
---
Yeah, not a fan of "outfits" taking precedence over armour.
---
Armour should be visible. To balance it, give some "unarmoured" perks to make it viable choice.
---
Is there a subreddit for sharing pictures of cool things like this? Or is it just here? I have some photos I would love to share. 
---
They have the mechanics, you can do that in fallout new Vegas

Drop all holotapes you can except quest ones then try. Thats how I got past this bug.
---
Well that‚Äôs what I did my camp is at Bolton greens
---
Are you under the impression this little witticism countermands this?
---
&gt; You've got no dignity, no class and no clue.
---
It doesn't, you're coming across as more stupid and naive by the minute. Keep it up though.
---
I have the union cap and it sells for 14 for me. I found it at the random spawn north of Philippi's battlefield Cemetery¬†
---
Hmmm. They must reuse the vendor cage then. There's a terminal and everything back there. Just like the ones at the other train stations.
---
No, you wouldnt. 24 players in this huge world means that you will very, very rarely see someone else, if at all. Even in adventure mode, I can only think of handful of times I've randomly encountered another player without seeking them out (or being in an event). 
---
Iv never seen it there before 
---
Pretty much every container is instances and randomized. Only a handful of containers have shared loot, and those are usually only related to random events or government aid drops. Otherwise, pretty much every container in the game is instanced to your account, and whether it has loot or not is based on a mix of RNG or anti-farming techniques.
---
I'm kind of confused at one stage you're at, but there's an annoying part where you read an entry and it seems finished, but nothing happens. There's actually a next page that you have to read by pressing the spacebar or something. Confounded many a player as it doesn't tell you there's more text.
---
So you are saying you no longer want the list? I'm confused
---
hell yeah brother
---
So let‚Äôs say I‚Äôve got 13 invested points in strength.  But my strength reads 17.  This addition is from mutations, armor, and weapons.  If I unequipped one of those items my 17 will go down however many points listed on that item.  This will manifest itself like my carry weight may go down some, and melee weapon damage will decrease?   
---
Check it then server hop 
---
I can buy for you just pay when have Caps I‚Äôm on PS4 
---
Weird but I get what you‚Äôre saying, missing some achievements myself that I‚Äôve done but won‚Äôt count towards it, they‚Äôve been doing good fixing bugs hopefully this will make it onto their list soon 
---
Wow ... looks great.  I could never give that up.  I bet it would never let me down, run around, or desert me!
---
What kind of gauss rifle do you have?  Mine is around 220 damage and takes a long time to even put a dent in it. 
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Interesting, I didn't know that. also thanks for the downvote whoever... smh
---
yes, but no Charleston camps until then, sweetie
---
I don‚Äôt think redeemed has actually ever played an mmo at this point.
---
Discovered this place over the weekend.  Had no issues exploring it, but the game did run especially horrid for me in recent days.  Give it another try next time you get to play
---
It wasn't me! Probably one of those Free States bastards.
---
Visible once you found them will be nice 
---
Same.  A run through Watoga, Whitespring's interior, and the enclave bunker (trash cans are everywhere!) gets me enough food for a couple weeks.
---
Happy pastry hours
---
Ha!
---
Wait, for real? I usually build a few rocket turret platforms for that fight.
---
They are all wtf nuisance worse than molerats, I don‚Äôt want to waste a single second on them tbh. I don‚Äôt know how effective the report mechanism is but I didn‚Äôt bother. One or two shot then hop server is most effective. The wasteland created by Bethesda artists is incredible, I want to enjoy it and nothing else when I play. Good thing is there are far fewer of them now since slap damage is removed. 
---
Well-done...err....-played. 
---
It would be a great way to make many of the old duped items worthless if new level 55, 60, 65, 70 etc weapons where to be introduced in the future. Perhaps the Prestige system will introduce special Prestige level weapons.
---
If it includes your pathetic "military" past, then no.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7o2xw/dear_fallout_from_an_exmilitary_member_please/
---
Seriously? And you feel you are qualified to tell other people what their emotional anchors should be?
---
You're a moron.
---
And I'll bet your "career" in the military added up to professional head-cleaner, nothing more.
---
I've not seen one but I thought this is the best place!
---
Lmao, you hit the nail on the head there bud 
---
" You can wipe their big stupid grin off with ENFORCER, which has 
---
a heavy 30% chance to cripple limbs. Mod a shotgun for range and speed and unload on the stupid bat until it falls to the ground,"
---
When you say this, are you JUST modding your shotgun itself for most possible range, or are you also using skeet shooter? 
---
I have a big corn/razorgrain field that i lock in, and i want them to be there for dailies, and want to share it with some friends. Right now i use a keypad door, but the codes is a hassle.. 
---
There is no more guessing. Todd already said that you get a token for every legendary you turn in. Then use that token to reroll a legendary.
---
Don't go anywhere near Survival Mode. You will lose all your caps and get extremely frustrated. 
---
Well while we're at it, why doesn't a level 91 Deathclaw drop more than scrapable junk and an edible steak?  On the ground, they're just as easy to kill.  One swing for the deathclaw, 2 for the scorchbeast.  Ignore the \*claw until it lands, then whack whack and it's done.
---
Lovely place, dude!
---
when (if) they make player camps not destroyable by other players I wanna make my camp there...
---
it's a beautiful piece of land with lines for crops, water source and a barn you don't have to build. most people have no idea they may even block a spawn btw....probably like most people don't know about the OTHER place he spawns by the ice cream shop north by Grafton. it's a faster server hop too and I see him more often.
---
Yea the favorite wheel situation thing is also pretty annoying 
---
I'll admit I don't entirely understand how DR/ER works other than more is better. So in comparing t51 to x01, is that 55DR difference really that meaningful? Can someone explain the real difference there?
---
do it like scp containment breach where i can talk into a mic and project my voice for everone to hear
---
Think about it though guys, There would be no need for a physical display image if items were never intended to drop in that manner, It would actually save massive server power which is why items drop in paper bags. But to keep the capability in game but have it deactivated actually takes up space, so for a internet only game that needs to  be as streamlined to run smoothly you would think Bethesda would remove that capability completely by removing the image data file, Physics engine code for dropped items etc.
---
I know what your going to say though, Most of the background mechanics are lifted stright off FO4 and it's probably integral to a lot of code.
---
But a little part of me thinks Bethesda left it in for a reason as they did initially state weapons would be in display cases etc but then the other day they also said " You can decorate your CAMP with junk" which I assume will simply add to the build budget like anything else would as not to over crowd the server with people dropping hundreds of items.
---
Guess we will all just have to wait and see
---
That is the perks of melee builds, 2 of 3 characters I have are gun builds and I never have enough mats. But the melee build has more supplies that ever lol
---
They know 98% of everything will be junk, so they wont do this.
---
Legitimately I watched my buddy (level 45) go to the event to leech experience and goodies from pegging the queen a couple of times(i told him not to as that's just poor etiquette). When he got to her there were four levels 100+ fighting hard and about a dozen level 30 and below hanging about taking pot shots and not at all contributing to the fight.
---
They got her down past hp regen and to about 1/3 hp left. With about 30 seconds on the clock. 
---
They failed that day and one of the level 100s was **salty** about the low levels.
---
My dude was like "man fuck this guy where is the mic"
---
I stopped him from doing something stupid by bitching at a man who probably spent countless stims, ammo, time, and deaths, to launch a nuke, summon the beast and ultimately fail.
---
i love all the different levels
---
Server hop leader of the pack.  Ever wolf leader kill counts.  It's what I used.
---
They removed the warning you get in Adventure mode for Survival? I swear I have always got a message when my camp is under attack and I'm not nearby...
---
As someone who build/scrap to unlock mods, I would personally love to see a cheap spring vendor.
---
I've had this happen, but I wish I could let the person know that it's fine, I want to buy a plan or two they had too. A lot of random traders will scoff at your request to buy their best gun, but not give you a chance to buy anything else! 
---
Yes that happens. I actually picked up my TSE double barrel shotty from a non-legendary zealot after a SBQ battle. I was just hoping to get a few more hardened mass and was hugely surprised when I saw the loot list, zealots usually carry poor loots, sometimes none at all. 
---
Hehehehe, that was a satire post in response to someone wanting to remove the alcohol daily quests because of real life alcoholism lol
---
Wasn't this already datamined? Let me see if i can find the post. It's already thought of.
---
That would be great news.
---
I would honestly like the favorite option to lock your item down. Can‚Äôt sell (maybe doesn‚Äôt show up in trade menu), can‚Äôt put anywhere other than stash, can‚Äôt drop, can‚Äôt scrap
---
Yup 
---
I thought cnd was mostly affected by Intelligence?
---
If you can see if under modify in armor bench then that means yes 
---
Perfect.   Thanks man.  
---
While I do think your right, this would be freaking amazing, the game has no mechanic to use other types of ammo for a single weapon.  It does have the concept of changing the receiver to use a different ammo type though, both crafted ammo(prime/utracite) and effecting existing ammo (syringer) so I‚Äôd vote for one of those styles, probably leaning towards the syringer style since it doesn‚Äôt require multiple new ammo types to deal with.  
---
Don't forget all The stuff they will be adding soon is already in the data file, When i see stuff like this it makes me think to when Bethesda started talking about more NPCs in the game over the next few months.
---
You never know...or it could simply be a FO4 bug as you said 
---
Just a thought....that's all
---
Did you look at the damage this thing kicks out in the screen shot? That's without additional buffs and 60ish % health. I the best part about this game is the ability to adapt your play style to make the most of what the RNG gives you..And believe me when I have this up and running it basically a magic wand that explodes everything it touches.
---
also? it's shitty game design for someone to build a camp and block a rare spawn. how is anyone ever supposed to know they may be blocking a random encounter so they can't build somewhere? there are SO many random encounters all over the map and nothing tells a builder that ... so let's punish other players for not knowing? cool story. 
---
(I had a camp destroyed 3 times in a 24 hour period once in what I assume was a random encounter spot and had no idea it was - not this place btw until I finally moved and haven't ever rebuilt my decom shower because it took months to farm stuff the first time...)
---
Yup. Total douche move.
---
Hubba hubba message for skeleton couple
---
Can find it around fissures and I've seen it in some of the mines some times. I dont really search for it noticing I don't use it myself. I assume it would drop off Scorchbeasts and the queen too. 
---
My buddy didn't get one and they destroyed everything. It too forever to repair! I had the entrance shot off mine the other day so they could jump in past the key code. No warning at all. Unless the system is glitching and not letting us know. 
---
canned dog food + good doggy perk.
---
alt 1: Cannibal perk
---
alt 2: butchers bounty perk
---
Certainly hope so!
---
The shitposting group is down the hall
---
Oh okay, you're just going a different direction. I misunderstood.
---
Yes, that would make sense. I can see the casing being worthless after scrapping, but the lead and gunpowder should be salvageable at least I would think.
---
On a real note, is that a legit datamine of the presidential armor?
---
Damn, game crashed and i couldn't pick it up :(
---
Leader of the Pack event gives you lots of wild meat plus some low level legendaries. Defend workshop events might give mongrel meat, mole rat meat, etc.
---
there is an ice cream shop north by Grafton, nearish farm houses east of grafton. i can't think of the name off hand but it's not the creamery near the tea house .
---
If you dont mind my asking, why not the quantum variant?
---
Oh yeah, PA is your friend. When you start adding perk cards to maximize your build later on it gets even better.  
---
Is it a marked location or a unmarked? Sorry for the questions I just really want to find the vendor and the only time I have someone shot it dead ü•∫
---
That was it. Thank you for actually sharing that 
---
That's gonna leave a mark...
---
hi there, i need i calib shock if possible, sent you my GT on PM :)
---
Online at the moment...
---
It wasn‚Äôt showing up as free for me either, but my game crashed and when I signed back in and checked it was there. Maybe try signing out and back in?
---
Thanks everyone.  Maybe I‚Äôve been smoking too much weed?  Nah.   
---
yes, did a texture swap to get it to show up in the game.
---
Advanced power connectors is where its at.
---
NP.
---
Was a good suggestion :)
---
yeh i cant wait i got ammo to sell legendarys heaps of aid.
---
going to be so fun my shop will be behind overlook just behind whitesprings on the cliffs :)
---
I‚Äôm in that same boat. I really don‚Äôt want to start another character for one weapon. 
---
Charleston vendor appears there anyway- I‚Äôve seen it twice with a camp right in that spot. But if you wanna be a troll...
---
No comment would have been better than this reply. 
---
Got it, but thanks!
---
I'd stop by, heavy gun / PA build here
---
got me, lol
---
You can increase damage by 90% with low health and add a perk card to add 20% more damage. You have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about 
---
Problem is i have to buy it from atom store first. Asking if someone already bought it and know the answer
---
The map would need to be a lot more accurate. Most of the ridges are drawn in the wrong place, if they're drawn at all.
---
Lol. The more I hear people the more I think we will all just be sitting at our shops, but no one will come because we are all manning our shops! Haha. 
---
I use a Gauss Rifle and the Tormentor perk. 15% chance to cripple a limb so always aim for the wings to bring it down, then switch to your melee or whatever. Gauss ammo is made from only steel and lead which are common. 
---
Tbh half I ignore the fuckers
---
War...War never changes....so what are you waiting for? Some changes? 
---
no worries about questions! 
---
it's Janet's I think...it is def marked. it's by far the easiest place to server hop and farm. you basically spawn in behind the trailer - clear mobs at trailer then run down the road. when you reach the whitespring bus on its side, the spawn is right past that. if it's not him you can log out there. when you log in you will be right by the spot behind the trailer again. I have seen him there many more times than Charleston ever. too bed I haven't seen the rare outfits, haha
---
good luck, have fun!
---
IIRC, the T60 I picked up from the Forest/ashheap/toxic valley spawn points are either L40 or L45.   
---
IDK max level
---
A lot of uniform plans are rare because they don‚Äôt cost a lot to create and sale for a lot to a vendor, if you don‚Äôt already have one DO NOT sell them they can net you thousands of caps in a short time for little effort 
---
Reslly there is undersrmor there hm thought u ment the non atom shop vtu jumpsuit.
---
Someone had a issue with pa I remember, take off pa and try it. Quest name?
---
I one shot most people, only ones I can‚Äôt is sent/ass. And yes bloodied does significantly more dmg. There are plenty of perk cards to avoid dmg at low health and have increased dmg resistance but yes radiation is a problem if you don‚Äôt have the perks
---
Lol. Paper damage of weapons doesn't mean a thing in pvp. I am well aware of how bloodied works and doesnt. I have been there with a full bloodied build. Thanks but no thanks.
---
My Nest doorbell sends a screenshot to my pipboy.
---
do you notice a significant difference in rank 5 vs rank 1 of adrenaline - I have been debating whether I should rank this up... a lot of people say rank 5 is not worth it...
---
What weapon are you using?
---
Definitely, I'd sell them cheap due to the high demand and me having no need for them. 
---
I was helping a younger player, maybe 13yrs old, and they were happily showing off their newly found weapons. Getting the occasional ping ofa bullet off my power armor. Oh I should point out at Whitesprings Artisan's corner, when they pull out a rocket launcher, and sure enough, pop a rocket. Well this sets off all the bots, turrets too. All I could do to not laugh at them crying out for help. They get killed, spawn outside, and get killed again. Being helpful, I grab their baggie, server hop, and invite them back. Evil person in me thought it was great entertainment.
---
Nice, I haven't actually seen the datamine for that as of yet. Do you know if images of the other presidential items are out there?
---
I don't have any arguments against this, but could we perhaps first key security/keypad doors that can be opened from the inside, first?
---
Then you must constantly need screws and gears and springs!
---
These are very cool! I like the forest one the best!
---
ah ok, thanks. At least I got the varsity jacket.
---
Well that‚Äôs your opinion and I gave mine. It works for me and plenty other people but my other perks are all tailored for a bloodied build. So I don‚Äôt get one shot with 20% health
---
&gt; real life alcoholism
---
Which is no joke either.
---
Listen, friend, I work with people on a daily basis who have real issues - substance abuse, lost kids, PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies.
---
You have no idea the buttons you press.
---
Just stop being a little prick and grow up. If you're VERY lucky, none of this stuff will hit you.
---
Like I said, you have no dignity and no class. The clue will come in time.
---
I've never known such freedom till I tried melee, I've always been a gun build so being able to just walking around with only 2 weapons and carry almost a whole house on my back and still have room is AMAZING 
---
Get a piece of chameleon armor, spam crouch the moment it activates, and move. Do this with a friend, so you can verify. Should take about 10 seconds and persists after death.
---
Bloodied explosive dragon 
---
Lol. Since it‚Äôs April Fool‚Äôs Day, I was chilling at the Overseer‚Äôs camp in my red suit with a flaming pitchfork.
---
But I also put a low level heated pitch fork and some other goodies in the trunk. There was a lvl 3, a child with an open mic there. When he was out of sight, I checked, and the box was now empty. 
---
Rock that pitch fork little dude.
---
Also use a bloodied crit handmade 
---
I think it should just show a proximity icon when your near a region, say double to three times the size of a Nuked area. You see vendor spots when you look at the map then. When you move Flatwoods up to Morgantown, then your circle changes and you can see another set of camps, even some overlap perhaps. I don't want to see others items from any terminal. If we see everyone all at once, then it could be hard for people to sell stuff. All TSE items grouped together an someone with a gamertag like mine will be way down the list. I'm more likely to buy looking at someones camp direct than going through Falloutmazon and seeing everything. Plus it gives us reasons to wander around the map more.
---
a jumpsuit cannot be shielded any underarmor can
---
Thanks much appreciated.
---
Be safe In the wasteland fellow Wastelander! 
---
Both of these. I've been collecting Quad Explosove variants of shotguns. I currently have a Quad Explosive Double Barrel, a Quad Explosive +50 DR while aiming, and a Quad Combat (I need the damned explosive variant), and everyone drools over the two quad explosive lol. I can have Instigating, Armor piercing, two shot. Nope. They want the weapons I use. Then get mad when I won't sell or set the price to 25k, because if I were to part with any of them I want everything you have and everything I'm able to have. Which really means, I don't want to sell these but if you are willing to pay out the nose then I might consider it.
---
A bunch of people have been gathering at Whitesprings ahead of the vendor patch to buy and sell all kinds of things, and out of 6 people that viewed my inventory only one person didn't ask for my Quad/Explosive/+50 DR ADS Pump Action. I finally just started putting my main weapons in my stash before trading, because if they see that then they usually won't consider any other item in my inventory.
---
Oh! Better option. Give us a way to mark our items as protected, so that we can't accidentally scrap them and they won't show up in the trade menu. This would be especially important to have before the legendary vendor is rolled out.
---
Where are good places to make him spawn ?
---
Do you mean it won't let you pick up the already repaired boards that are scattered around, or won't let you replace the damaged cores with the repaired ones.  I took your post to mean the already repaired ones scattered about.  I usually carry 30 repaired cores in my inventory so I don't have to search them out every time and can repair them at my leisure.
---
It would be neat if they had the radio beacon thing for your camp like in Fo4. But instead of attracting settlers it would show an icon on the map for other players to visit. 
---
I mean atom shop jump suit because its underarmor
---
I‚Äôve got these , they are awesome! I always wondered if there was one for the Mire and Ash heap
---
Haha that's great. It's stuff like this that makes me like the game in spite of issues. 
---
Same. I've got an instigating max level Gauss Rifle and against a level 85 Scorchbeast even a sneak attack doesn't do that much damage really. It's not *that* difficult, but 3 shots?! Against a level 50 with max damage perks &amp; sneak attack perks while undetected &amp; all headshots from below the ranged damage drop off, *maybe*
---
likewise!
---
Especially if you main melee, and only use those shooty things for when you're too fat to run over and beat things to death.
---
this is why I wish the PS4 didn't limit you to 50 photos....or there was an option to export them ..
---
Not really obsidian lore focused more on post war  and a few things pre war 3,4 and 76 focused on both most of our in depth pre war knowledge  comes for 3,4 and 76
---
Biggest problem I have is finding the stuff I want to give them (on xbox). By the time I scroll through and find the complete lvl 5 armor + weapons and ammo and drop it all they have already split.
---
Yeah same.
---
Gatling gun is a good answer to that problem. 
---
Thank you! I‚Äôve really enjoyed your photos!
---
Always bypass the reactor to save time, but some people like to run around and fix the pipes because it's on a timer.
---
Yeah a little pvp if fun, but if I wanted it to be the main point, I would do it in a totally different game.
---
For the first few months of playing, I avoided everyone like the plague.
---
I've honestly never saw her and got lost a few times my first play days here. 
---
people are always buying ammo...
---
You know, this is the only acceptable form of CAMP destruction I'll support.
---
Since patch 6, the Deep Pocketed Marine Limbs plan is always present at the Ash Heap vendors (Camden, Welch, Lewisberg), as far as I know. Just make your 1400 caps a day however you like, and then pop over to buy the plan.
---
Before patch 6, a server hop would re-roll all the vendor stock. Since patch 6, almost all plans are fixed to specific vendors, although a handful are still somewhat random.
---
Csigafroccs
---
I‚Äôve got them exact 4 too so I‚Äôll assume just them 
---
Well dont I have .308 all over my face :/
---
I picked up an 3*AA .50 Cal somewhere and it helps....if i have the heavy pos on me
---
Yup, never heard or seen of the Responder Vendor bot anywhere else.  Citation please.
---
Yes.  I really miss the explosive armor piercing 45 thompson.
---
Yup, he sells all of them all the time. Also, calibrated shocks adds 50 per leg, and motion assisted servos on the chest adds 2 strength, bringing you up to about 425. Also, if you log out while in power armor and log back in... well just thank me after.
---
Gary also sells the lever action plans btw.
---
Make a photo wearing a beer hat after. Dont forget to craft and drink 50 beers
---
Heated up some pizza for lunch, while singing this god forsaken song in my head from the other post.............now I am going to be singing it at dinner for craps sake. 
---
What in the world?
---
I don't have a note, just the holotape and I hit play and let it go all the way to the end.
---
Yup, the random encounters can't proc if you fast travel everywhere.
---
Make what you need at early lvls, make it all later when you have ammosmith and super duper.
---
All I have is overseer tapes :(
---
Xbox does too, don't feel so bad.
---
Ooh, nice.  I've never seen these.
---
It's almost my birthday.  Hint hint...
---
See a scorched with a sledgehammer and get a switchblade
---
Lol im half tempted to test it 
---
Yeah got them cause I pre-ordered and bought everything they released when it came out.
---
Look up XGrimHarlequinX anytime.  I'm 49 and am always looking for friendly folks (old or new).  I usually ignore blind team requests as they've become an easy way for griefers to fast travel to your camp and and take a dump on your porch, but if you send me a text I'll keep an eye out for it and send you a friend request.... password: OldFarts.
---
I‚Äôm built there too
---
Sssssssssssh. Nobody knows about it still... I like not having camp packed up, lol
---
I do not wear PA. But it was for One of Us. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm just having issues loading into interior cells. I just tried loading into a mine and it crashed 
---
Is this after you have been to the EMP place? I might be getting confused with bugs. 
---
Make it zz so it goes to the bottom of the list
---
IMHO, level isn't everything.  
---
So far, I've found the L68 radscorpions harder to kill than a L91 glowing deathclaw.
---
Yeah i'm not saying it's impossible. With my shotgun spec character I have not many issue, if it comes close enough.
---
My other char is heavy/explosive spec tho, and I can say: don't hope you'll VATS with a plasma gatling (my other main weapon is an auto grenade launcher, which won't work at all on air-born mob soooo....)
---
Thank you! I hope you share yours I'd love to see them!
---
Mine is very similar, I don't have all Benches open, but I do have Cooking, Water, Weapons, Bed, and a Stash Box. They'll see if from one of the roads fairly easy as well. I deal for the most part in Bulk Junk sales. :)
---
I run sentinel assassin but it‚Äôs nowhere near as defective as a bloodied stealth sniper build focused on CRITS. This build is the META. Crits ignore all armor, 100% damage boost and 100% accuracy. If that‚Äôs not the most OP thing right now I‚Äôd like to know what is 
---
That sounds like a trade to me! Not sure how much cloth I have but I‚Äôll check and let you know 
---
I reeeeeally hope you're not on Xbox lol
---
I'm at 400 hours in and are still discovering workshops i didn't know existed.
---
Yeah, all my legendary stuff in storage will go to the vendor, but tons of plans, rare outfits, and other rare stuff will be going on player vending as soon as I can get it setup. :)
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Not sure if you have read this but here is some actual data that gives an idea of how pvp is working. It's not perfect but it is definitely enlightening in how legendaries don't matter and how weapons are categorized into groups that all do the same damage based on a percentage of opponents total hp.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5zo2o/survival_damage_testing_results_and_personal/
---
Just an FYI. I have a lvl 12 pvp character. I one shot most people with a lvl 10 shotgun. If they are full health it may take 2. The ability to 1-2 shot an opponent is not proof that a legendary effect is working. Everyone is 1-3 shotting everyone. No matter the weapon. My fav is an lmg right now. I tried pvp is with my lvl 80 with a plain lvl 50 lmg. Killed people in half a second.
---
For max DPS I would tell you to go for Headshot crits. But if you don‚Äôt want to use vats, your best bet would be an instigating rifle. Probably a hunting rifle or a lever. And skillful aim so you can land headshots. 
---
I love these posters! I would to get my hands on em!
---
Ballistic bear is busted. You cant increase  ranged weapon damage with food
---
I currently have around 400.
---
Our first xbox died so i had to start my collection again, thankfully i'd taken photos of some like the Rose one or they'd be gone forever! being able to export would be awesome
---
I had three after me in one go the other day. I‚Äôm level 36. 
---
I ran like the wind. 
---
Lvl 50 one shot with primed bloodied gauss. Lvl 80 two shot.
---
Makes sense doesn‚Äôt it?
---
Are they A4 or larger? I got a massive pre-order bundle too but I reckoned the posters were meant to be put up in the store since not heard many others with them 
---
Actually i read a few people who accomplished it said you only need to focus on one or two events and hop server to get it done. If you travel around and look for legendary while being ambushed by others, yea it won‚Äôt be easy. There are glitches where even two and three star kills don‚Äôt count, that can be annoying, but you get to keep the legendary loot from the drop so there‚Äôs no real loss. 
---
You and I have different experiences.
---
Wow, thanks dude. That‚Äôs a huge help
---
Do you have all the separate vendor locations found yet? I do a combo of vendor runs and caps stash location runs now days to full the bank.  Cap Collector maxed out and Fortune Finder perk cards will load you up with free caps that regenerate every 20 hrs (I believe). I average 50 caps per box...sometimes less, sometimes WAY more (my best so far is 210 out of one box).
---
Where at? I did that walk yesterday too and got nothing of note but some fusion cores off the sentrybot.
---
I‚Äôm an Enclave soldier, and I approve this message.
---
The main reason they will most likely not move her...well, that is the location where the soda bar is in located in the real Greenbriar hotel in the White Springs. They like to keep things related to the real world.
---
I've gotten one of those messages in the 399 hours I've played. Even though my base has been attacked multiple times (I check the map fairly often as I am paranoid)
---
It seems inconsistent at best.
---
^I ^made ^a ^rant ^about ^what ^transpired ^with ^the ^person ^attacking ^me.
---
I hear that adventure will eventually contain camp immunity. But I'm not too sure. 
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm still grinding away 
---
If you don‚Äôt find anyone I can find it a home I have some friends that want It but don‚Äôt have money 
---
Maxson's coat. I would love to have that. 
---
I loved how New Vegas handled ammo.
---
I certainly am ;p
---
I‚Äôm parked a little bit closer to the landmark there though
---
Probs still in the same boundary...
---
I can take out a lv 50 by expending WAY too much ammo and effort, but if I ever get the "oh hey three lv 80s came to fuck your workshop or camp up" I just log the fuck out. Only time I haven't is when I got two, managed to pacify one somehow with animal friend, and then hid long enough for the other one to fuck right off.
---
It could be that my monitor is particularly bright since it is a Planar high refresh 3D monitor. The extra brightness is available to counter the 3D shutter glasses, so it is probably turned up from playing other games, and most have in game brightness and gamma settings. I'll try turning it down.
---
You are not forced, but choosing to stay is something you only do cause u like the punishment apparently.
---
There is few downsides to just changing servers
---
While doing the Nukashine quest,  I found the murder gnomes photo. I  got a photo of that one.  I usually take photos of stuff, but a lot of these little Easter eggs hadn't occurred to me to record. I should start taking more photos like these,  great idea for sure!
---
Hope so. Makes things a lot easier to farm food / make a cool settlement for my friend Prestine G. 
---
Yeah pretty sure they were meant to be put in the  stores since they only got 8 in total at my GameStop. The 4 I have and 4 duplicates.
---
If it's possible I've heard moving your camp a few feet and placing the blueprints down will fix it at only the cost of the caps to move.
---
Unless you use trickery to make your house look good and moving isn't a viable option, like I do.
---
I play a ton of games, but even with what you said it would require u to just leave the system on constantly while doing anything else.
---
It‚Äôs Not how it supposed to look üôÑ the shin guards and thigh pieces fit over your under armor. But you go ahead and wait for that patch. 
---
AA Dragon to start makes them easy enough to kill, still not worth the ammo wasted and the weapon wear for what the drop. If the made ever SB drop a legendary there would be a point to fight them.
---
sammmmmme.  I had the perfect spot to camp, but god damn scorch beast.  Plopped down 10 rocket turrets to combat it.  Killed it, 2nd one spawned blew up my turrets since they were all at half or less HP.  Repaired turrets, killed SB, 3rd one spawned... Nope. Moved my camp. 
---
I'm going to guess you served in the Navy.  Since you used the term head to describe the latrines and you don't have thick enough skin to be a Marine.  Correct?
---
Yes, and I was thinking that seasons like spring and summer could increase certain flora, while fall and winter could reduce them.
---
I would buy, presuming your on the ‚ÄòBox. 
---
I had something like this happend too. I tried a lot of different ways but ended up moving my camp 10 feet to the left and rebuilt it. It sucked but it was the only way that worked for me.
---
Yes, I do as well, if I can. Somtimes there's just too many enemies around to loot right away, but that doesn't stop their bodies from disappearing as I loot. The issue isn't the looting. The issue is the bodies vanishing and not being able to loot everything. They had it fixed once before, then they broke it again with the Wild Appalachia update.
---
I just go about my business and kill them when they land. My camp is in a cave so it can't damage anything, though the turrets inside aggro the scorchbeast and it lands right outside the entrance that is mostly blocked with a concrete "wall" (foundation). When I hear it land, I go 1 shot it, collect the goodies, then carry on with whatever I was doing.
---
Folks out there will make the serum for free if you bring the ingredients.  And of course be nice and top them something too.

The game has been out for less then 3.5 years, hence why the number is behind unrealistic without just leaving the system on non stop.

West down the road from Lady Janets Soft Serve, spawn point is just beyond the bus. Usually spawns in 5-6 server jumps, less if lucky, more if you pissed of the RNG-gods. I have bought plans and clothes of him there for weeks in preparation for the upcoming Player vending.
---
Holy crap! Could it be?! A reason for me, a trader, to get back into the game?! Exciting! Too bad irl is kicking up now and I don't really have the time to be an NPC like I did over Christmas break.

Yes, that's happened too. Annoying as that is, it's better than when they vanish completely.

Ah enclave, now I remember. That's where you go to the roof and then the cargobot drops the orbital plans. I'm on pc here, maybe a hardware instability if no one else is having the same issue :\
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid to pick up guns that you already have and break them down to get new mods for crafting.  For a while I just ignored most weapons and was wondering when I could upgrade my weapons even though I had my gun making perks upgraded
---
Which event?
---
Can you detail exactly how to get inside. I have tried allsorts to no avail. 
---
I have marsupial, speed daemon and PA with jetpack 
---
You should have tank killer, bloody mess, and all the semi automatic perks
---
I'm melee and agree that the mini should only be an endgame, but I got lucky and snagged a 2 shot mini from a Whitesprings ghoul drop, modded it for a prime receiver and stacked out the heavy gun perks.  It did decent damage then, but since the buff it's even more helpful with the SBQ.  Pain in the butt switching all my cards around, but I've gotten pretty quick about it 
---
No joke?? Oh man, thank you.

I can‚Äôt count the number of times I tried relogging to see if I was bugged or not lol.

They should just drop Cyrodiil in the middle of Appalachia so we can have some real pvp. 
---
Thank you.

100% a Nuka cola workshop. I wish there was a few more workshops, I like using them. 
---
Knobby Pipes is what I consider the gold mining workshop- I wish there was a gold standard as you say, I have 100 weight in gold scrap lol
---
I put my camp somewhere on the east side so I have Vault 76 and my camp to fast travel to for free. Saves on travel expenses. Building virtually on top of a train station by 3 workshops makes literally no sense.
---
What I've noticed in some of these situations (take for defiance for example) is the remains will travel back to where that creature was originally at before you agro'd it
---
That's useful, thanks
---
I'm pretty sure it's going to contain a new batch of people complaining about how Bethesda ruined everything.
---
Search "marine boots" here and get back to me. That's where I found the info after I posted here. I was searching the wrong thing. I'm glad you feel so strongly about this. But you're wrong. Sorry to say. Downvote me all you want. There's a few other posts about this. 
---
That's pretty easy if you connect it to a pressure plate or a switch. The wire from the plate/switch has to be connected to a "secret" connection right above the door, kind of inside of it.. 
---
I think having workshops with unique purposes would make them more valuable. I know certain ones have different resource deposits but your idea seems much more interesting.
---
Really like the idea of the machinist shop to craft springs, screws and gears! 
---
They do, and I believe Watoga has the same cap pool. Might be Harper's Ferry, but I know they share it with one of the static vendors. 
---
Damage has definitely been buggy.
---
Same here some of my friends would enjoy it
---
Yup, as others have posted,  corn, tato and mutfruit are good for this. That and just exploring. 
---
Be sure to tag adhesive for finding it easier when you're out exploring as well.

Y‚Äôknow, NukaCrypt got me with this yesterday.

Yeah, ran into a guy from the Society of Owls shortly after posting this. Bought three Prime plans off him. Set me back a little on getting these plans.

Thought about it. You can probably fly to the roof if you want to finish that quest. The terminal is up there. It shows the quest marker on the door but it's really outside on the roof.

Most of my 200+ followers on XBOX come, I believe, for exactly these kinds of captures. All the random teddy bears. Lol. It‚Äôs great.
---
Wow that's an amazing shot! 
---
Single mutation is useless unless you have full weightless gear
---
Armor only works when standing still (and crouched)
---
Stealthboys work until you attack
---
Right now they are hardly worth even going after. I think if they consolidated some of the resources to make them more valuable it would really help!  It would add some more intrigue to the game for sure.  Not to mention it would be nice to be able to obtain rarer items without server hopping!
---
Text chat please
---
And they should add Skyrim dragons to the game but make em look like bats or some shit. 
---
Thats also me ;) so it just means I got you twice.

It's the mission where you put the items together, it wont let me get the schematics OR interact with the computer

There ya go. Bethesda must not have fixed the preview image. Hence the confusion.

Gods thank you!

This is the first time I have seen any mod on any platform confirm that is indeed a bug and not intended.
---
I died a really stupid death to some ghouls (I use them to quickly lower health with blocker and no armor instead of a gamma gun). The insult bot showed up when I respawned xD
---
I‚Äôll read it, you can‚Äôt forget that lower levels can do more dmg because of the boost they get for being lower level 
---
LEGIT. 
---
I dismantled hundreds of pipe weapons and eventually stopped getting mods. Passed level 50, no mods ever, so I stop picking them up. Levels later there was a challenge for dismantelling them, the first one I grab in forever gives me a mod. What the fuck.
---
Thank you, i had to spam to the photos to get this one
---
I‚Äôve definitely seen 91‚Äôs there in all the time I camp that substation 
---
We're talking about the assholes that have turrets firing into the clubhouse.
---
I used the firepit and cooking stations. Lots of trial and error honestly. What platform are you on?
---
Yeah you can‚Äôt do it any longer. I wonder if it was because of all those times you would teleport thru the ceiling trying to vats them. 
---
Lucky!
---
I had to find a new area to build.. I tried like 10 times. It just didn't work.
---
Down the roads to Flatwood I suppose.
---
I think if they made each "mine" in the game specialize in something it would be so much better.
---
As far as the gold standard if each gold weighed .001 and it was worth 5 caps we could establish a market. You would in essence allow player to carry 125,000 caps in "currency". This would make premium item trades viable.
---

I learned it :/ I didn‚Äôt know it was rare lol
---
oh, sorry.
---
I'm on PC and have some Super Stimpaks I never use, I'll sell or trade 10 of them to you.
---
Hopefully it helps but If you move your camp, you get keep everything that was broken. This is what I do sometimes. Though rebuilding is a bothet sometimes. 
---
Lots of good tips and it sounds like I did it all right. I sold my first batch of bulk junk this weekend. Had buyer join me and we did not team up. I kept my junk in Stash until he said what all an how much he wanted. I grabbed the items and we did the trade for the agreed price. He even requested a few more things and I helped with that too. So all in all, it was a good experience and falls in line with a lot of the tips given here.

Behind Morgantown airport there is a farm that has tatos, corn, mutfruit and I think razorgrain.

If you dont mind my asking, what about the Phantom device? Other than getting enemies in a lather is it better or worse than the other options?
---
Longshot works now too. It used to be lame but I'm getting the damage at long range now.
---
Bethesda plz
---
Which plans were they?
---
Why not just stick to how "it just works" 
---
Please,pretty please let me have it. I have a buddy I've been dying to get into fallout 76 and he cant afford it right now and I cant get it for him. I've been playing with him for more than 10 years. He lives in New York and I in Michigan. We met through friends online and I consider him a better friend than most of my hometown friends. Spend every weekend playing with him, he keeps pulling me from fallout 76 and I'd love to tell him next time " no it's your turn to join me." Either way it goes, I get it or someone else, thanks for offering to someone who will use it.

Lol really? You get a survival mode so you can pvp your heart out and now thats too big and scary? Go play pvp and get wrecked. You wanted PvP. You got it.

How about instead of spending precious time trying to stand, squat, and twist over and around the environment to get that small dot to light up and pick up a single pencil, the X button just opens a list of items within 5 feet of your character you can pick up?
---
Thanks for repeating the next reply
---
Not as much as you'd think...all I carry are heavy guns and run lvl 45 excavator armor:
---
Bullet Shield lvl 3 =  Gain 60 Damage Resistance while firing a heavy gun. 
---
Fireproof lvl 1 =  Immediately gain +20 Fire Resistance 
---
Gunsmith lvl 5 =  Guns break 50% slower and you can craft Tier 5 guns (Plans required). 
---
Fix it good lvl 3 =  You can repair Armor and Power Armor to 200% of normal maximum condition. 
---
Stabilized lvl 3 =  In Power Armor, Heavy Guns gain excellent accuracy and ignore 45% armor. 
---
Weapon Artisan lvl3 =  You can repair any weapon to 200% of normal maximum condition. 
---
The two time I went after the SB Queen none of my guns broke (45% damage was the lowest I got on one) and I only had to repair the legs ( 35% damage)
---
I run out of steel for bullets more than anything else, lol.
---
5 weight per str, not 10. 
---
They are very easy to kill and drop plans.
---
In terms of general DR, T-51b is the best. X-01 is best especially for rads. Beyond that, Ultracite is third best, followed by T-60, T-45, excavator, and then raider. 
---
In the alleyway with the bodies being cleaned up, you can find 30+ crimson from brain fungus with Green Thumb.
---
Why so many generators?
---
Yeah, I read up on the work around - I‚Äôm just saying there shouldn‚Äôt HAVE to be a work around. Just let me toggle the built-in switch on the inside.
---
Agree with most on here.  Break away and explore and do events/side quests to level up.  comeback to the main quest later.
---
I‚Äôve tested it extensively, it doesn‚Äôt effect explosive weapons end of story.
---
eh, it's like everything else, folks will adjust to the beta and make a meta that includes only carrying around what you need. if only they had a way to store caps off your body so you can not worry about it while out hunting. then people will have a reason to go into a base and look for treasure. first person to find the stash gets the biggest portion of say 25% of the total stash, then every person afterwards get the rest. the CAMPs owner won't lose more than that in a single session. 
---
You can with a jetpack and a dream! Just believe in yourself, and the ability to explode / punch bats out of the sky
---
Ballistic Fist- with mods to chamber other ammo (and it actually consumes ammo this time)
---
I wish they had parents only servers.  
---
I don‚Äôt want people at my camp, I would be fine with it if there‚Äôs a player shop there 
---
NEEEEEERRRRRRRRRDDDDDDSSSSS!!!
---
Well anyone worth their salt is using weapon artisan, I was just giving OP an alternative to gunsmith. 
---
I have a chameleon armor peice and its great for sniping, but with a scope only, for open sights or dot or circle redicle, the sight it self is invisible. However a scope still has visible crosshairs. You have to crouch and not move, but you will remain invisible even after shooting. Great for solo or with freinds if youre a sniper.
---
Is that a monocle?!?
---
Ah thanks.. Yeah I was going off top of my head.
---
I was able to fix it. I had to completely unplug my Xbox for a little bit. I‚Äôm able to load into interior cells now. 
---
There's a plan for that!?!
---
This is just a hiccup in how legendary loot is added to a corpse. The legendary isn't directly added to the corpse, it's spawned into the world and then picked up by the corpse. 99% of the time this happens so quickly you don't even see the items render but on rare occasion the process lags enough to see the item pop in and unless you there's a second hiccup you can wait and it will disappear and you can find it in the corpse where it belonged. 
---
You would simply shift the weapon damage values to the applicable bolts. Dwarven arrow vs Dragonbone, or in this case regular bolt vs heavy/whichever one. Remnants of it are already in place with the Ultracite ammo. While you can't switch between ultracite and normal ammo on the fly (without changing a receiver), its still the same projectile with tweaked numbers.
---
Item displays probably aren't gonna be what you think they are.
---
Oh nvm I thought you had like a suit or something yeah you should have saved it it‚Äôs not a big deal it‚Äôs worth at most a couple thousand caps
---
The vtu suit that looks like the vault 76 one can be. Can find plans and craft it, give +5 base defenses, +2 luck end and int and +1 to str if I remember right.
---
why not get some new material
---
Middle mountains cabins. Always three Yogui bears, radscorpions, or those new things. Plus there are 4 rag stags hanging up. Plus a cooking station. Just east of the white springs train station. 
---
They are supposed to be the apex creature.  Since they were toned down from the holy shit amount of screeching.  They can be dealt with so much easier now. 
---
I know exactly where your camp is. It's just north of Lake Eloise, right? With the acid node in the cave and the lead node up top?

Well if I ever get notified my camp is taken I know who to talk to lol

The Nuka-Cola plant and WV Lumber are such obvious choices for workshops I almost think they were intended to be, but never got implemented. Especially with how isolated and plotless the lumber mill is.

Thanks! It was a bitch to build around but looks cool in the end 
---
Roughly 17 hours a day 
---
If your on the Box, you can have mine?
---
I'm just saying, with the weapon system that's IN fallout already it would be a lot easier to include a "Bolt igniter" "liquid nitrogen canister" "shrapnel arrow" receiver on the crossbow than it would be to build an entire ammo variant system into the game. 
---
I would LOVE it if they brought back ammo types, and moved it away from the "different receivers do more damage" metric we have now. But it's a lot less likely because they've already BUILT this system, it's in game now. It was in the last game.
---
The swap between ultracite ammo is no different than the swap between, say, .308 and .50 cal. It changes the receiver to fire a different round....and isn't swap-able on the fly, like the system in skyrim. 
---
Ah well, live and learn! At least I have the cool plans on that guy now lol
---
If you paint your favorite weapons or armor with a special paint job the items will be invisible to everyone else.  This prevents you from accidentally selling it at the vendors also.  Unfortunately, not all  weapons and armor have special paint that you can buy at the atom shop.
---
I hate them and I can‚Äôt even fight them
---
They see me from pretty far away and then just screech at me
---
My weapons don‚Äôt do anything to them
---
Hoping to eventually be able to kill then
---
bUTTSCRATchaaaarrrrrr!!!!
---
LOL.
---
Can anyone tell me if it‚Äôs the same with the mutation?
---
Yup. The top has some decorative "defenses" but I was able to power it through conduits glitched into the ground. That freed up the rest of my budget for a super dense build in the cave. With 1 entrance that small, the turrets actually make a difference on survival.
---
Right?!? FFS that was annoying to get to spawn....
---
You mean like it's Counterstrike: Source?
---
He‚Äôs clearing holding the assault rifle from Fallout Shelter, not 3. 
---
Any idea where you found the radiation emitter plans? That camp sounds awesome! Have been thinking of making one in one of the old bomb craters to help take down bloodied builds with the radiation.
---
I tried to do it, but I killed three legendary ghouls that didn't register and I just said fuck this. 
---
You mean like it's Quake?
---
I was kind of hoping so, but I haven't seen anything mentioned.
---
Given the game will just load up a login prompt if launched *outside* of the BGS Launcher, I don't see why not though. I've been starting 76 via Steam for months now as I want the FPS/Overlay from Steam. 
---
Only thing is I figure that Steam will want to download it again and I'm far, far too impatient for that :p
---
Rank 1: Gain +6% (max 36%) damage for 30s per kill. Duration refreshes with kills.
---
Rank 5: Gain +10% (max 60%) damage for 30s per kill. Duration refreshes with kills.
---
Almost wice the damage for the same amount of kills.
---
I do think it's worth it, especially in nuked zones such as whitesprings. Those ghouls are pretty beefy and if you want to one shot them without having to rely on bloodied or adrenal reaction you will need that rank 5. 
---
Outside nuke zones where mobs are much weaker you won't really need it but it can definitely help. 
---
For example one of the weapons i tend to use to clear up mobs is a Quad lvl 35 lever action rifle, not the best rifle but i like the fire rate. 
---
The first 2 mobs i shoot won't be one-shot kills. From the 3rd mob onward everything becomes a one-shot kill.
---
So i do need a +20% damage boost. With rank 5 you get that in 2 kills, if i had Rank 1 Adrenaline i would need at least 3 for a +18% boost.
---
Ofc you can use adrenal reaction, sacrifice some HP and you can get to the same results, but it's up to you if you're comfortable having low HP.
---
Here's 2 minutes of my own gameplay. The gun used is actually weaker than the lvl 35 quad lever rifle i mentioned above.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2PQrqbthn4 
---
You can see the boost in damage i get from adrenaline. It's the same with nuke zones ghouls, and damn it feels satisfying when you one-shot those ones.
---
It's also really nice with SBQ fights, pick up a couple of adds then use a crit on the queen. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Tl;dr i do think rank 5 is worth it, at least it's worth the points for me. 
---
In the end it's up to you and your playstyle. I may be the odd one, i'm giving up on all weight saving perks, i'm using AP legs for my PA instead of the allmighty calibrated shocks and i'm having a lot of fun by playing this way. 
---
What other people say about a specific perk may not apply to your own playstyle. Test it out for yourself, give it a try. 
---
[Joke's on you, I love that song!](/spoiler)
---
It is indeed a monocle
---
yeah i can image, getting enough floor lined up on the same level without it overflowing weird &amp; getting stairs to work at ALL most of the time can be a real bitch, can't have been an easy job!
---
I really hope so
---
Coming!
---
No, with mutation you cant wear armor and have to be unarmed
---
Definitely!  The workshops could be so much more. Especially since we are trying to rebuild Appalachia.  
---
You mean like how I actually melee in rl?
---
Are they large generators or fusion ones?
---
on PC? would you sell me some?
---
Similar results for my group. I‚Äôve seen enough mediocrity at SBQ fights from the level 100+ people that I think they have different definitions of ‚Äúprepare‚Äù and ‚Äúright perks‚Äù than you or I. 
---
What are you looking to get for them?
---
Sorry never played but have been playing most of the popular shooters out there and noticed the fortnight jump is really popular!
---
Do explosive railways benefit from demolition expert?
---
Just using large generators? I can hook you up with fusions if you have the mats.
---
Wont work with fo76 weapon modding mechanics.
---
Stealth-boy will let you move while invisible, I think is its advantage. 
---
According to some finding I read on here the other day, multiple pieces of chameleon supposedly stack, slightly removing the shimmer. Haven't tried it myself, it keeps giving me Chameleon chest armor and that's what I'm already using. 
---
1) Xbox one
---
2) xDarthGrumpyx
---
4) server crashed when I was exploring top of the world mezzanine.  Now when I try to reenter the mezzanine, the entire game crashes on the loading screen. 
---
Yes I understand that im not saying your wrong 
---
I bought them at the whitespring I think. It was definitely a vendor grab and I haven‚Äôt even been to Watoga on that character. 
---
*Maybe* Graham, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I didn‚Äôt buy anything off of him when I saw him. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I was high. 
---
I am not forgetting that. Those are just my experiences. However, the link I posted specifically uses a standard handmade (example 2) vs a bloodied explosive handmade (example 3) against the same opponent. Both weapons kill in 3 hits even though the BE handmade has 400 additional paper damage.
---
Yes we are all high lvl but we have the right perks and gear and melt her. 
---
I'll pvp unless your rockin ass/sent cav/sent. I dont mind the pvp but I feel those kinda suck. I mean they are good dont get me wrong, but when I think of pvp, jumping up n down in one spot isn't what sounds fun
---
CONGRATULATIONS! Your the winner of everyone hearing where you area
---
This sounds great lol
---
Everytime i did that around launch it would explode and send me flying through the ceiling. Maybe that's why they changed it?
---
Yep, I'm still occasionally discovering new fast travel points.
---
I think they should have forced people to only fast travel from train stations (like Survival) instead of allowing open travel everywhere.  Seems like a much better game when you have to hoof it.
---
So stalker perks for the win. Ok cool 
---
Let me know and gather as much as you can more you have the more plans I‚Äôll give
---
I have a ton of old plans, I can finally become the blueprint vendor of the wastes. Gonna happily cut it down to 1/2 or 1/3 of vendor price, especially the stuff with 20+ dupes
---
How about you check yourself, before you go making random assumptions. My friend has had a camp there since a week from launch, never moved it, rebuilt it tons of times. It never stopped the vendor from appearing. I probably wouldn't ever have seen the vendor if it wasn't for his CAMP. 
---
Get your facts straight, and go through the proper channels. There's no need for threats.
---
I think they crouch and the reloading this idk
---
High lvl didn't have the right setup then. Three of us melt her even when we have tons of low lvls there. Player was just blaming on others that's why it was a fail.
---
This would be a great to have ü§î The search continues 
---
If Bethesda wants events to be a bigger draw, they should:
---
* Reduce the number of events that are active at one time. Say maybe 2 or 3 events.
---
* Announce when an event starts to everyone on the server, similar to nukes.
---
* Make fast travel to events free.
---
* Increase the rewards. Maybe a random legendary item.
---
Boom, events are now super popular and populated.
---
There is also a lot of fun random encounters you miss out on if you fast travel.
---
I guess that's the price you pay for needing to be somewhere fast. Oh, that and all those caps.
---
Walk from overseer's camp towards Flatwoods. There's usually a mongrel hoard that spawns along the way. Then stop at the motel. There're usual mole rats that spawn. Closer to the hotel, often there is an opossum. When you get to Flatwoods, near the cooking area, there is sometimes opposum. You can kill the brahmin in town.
---
Leader of the pack event in the north west of the map near the raceway is good for lots of wolf meat. You also can get some low level legendary stuff when you kill the pack leader. 
---
That perk that gives you a chance to find extra meat is good.
---
Ive got enough damage boost from perks (vats stealth build) one shot most of the time anything apart from havier bosses though they still go down pretty quickly. I use food for AP reg boost and SPECIAL boost, especially luck for crits. Just simply dont find alcohol worth of my time in comparison to what they offer, withdrawal effects etc üòõ 
---
I believe the new Brahmin milk also removes rads but not mutations. Don‚Äôt quote me on that though. 
---
And apparently you are a level 140... so.  I can understand your pain, if you play it that much and hate it that much.
---
Yes, I have played 1, 2, 3, NV, 4 and all of the DLCs related to them.  Never played the BoS one.  Did I miss something?
---
To me, the other players are the NPC's.  I help them out, trade with them, ignore them.  So the quests probably feel longer to me, because I run into someone and suddenly the game takes on a new level.  Also, I read the notes and look at the things that happened rather than charging through it.
---
There's always Far Cry 5 New Dawn for you...  It's dropped down to $20, despite 93% reviews.  Personally, I hated Far Cry 5 because the ending was totally scripted with no choice whatsoever.  In fact, most of the game was like that, it just wasn't readily apparent. 
---
 Honestly, in Fallout 76 I haven't been dropping nukes because I don't want to... and the game is still fun.
---
I dunno.. Maybe you should try Red Dead?  Again, I felt the choices were really limited and know I would like the second part of the story, but just couldn't get there.  Also.. not a huge fan of westerns.  FNV was the exception to that.
---
Honestly don't understand why you are still playing it and still bashing it 3 months later.  You know you don't have to do either, right?
---
You're welcome.
---
Kinda want trader hubs with a slot per person for your vending machine! Cough whitesring cough!
---
I‚Äôve seen the disappearing bodies quite a few times myself, for me though they look like they drop through to the ground and into oblivion.
---
So they can stack that‚Äôs very interesting 
---
Yeah that would even be better.
---
I don‚Äôt have any op builds 
---
Yeah I don't have the plans for fusion generators yet
---
TBH, Instigating is not a great legendary effect as it applies only to the first shot in the best case scenario. With that said, the lever action is high enough base damage that its not a terrible weapon to have instigating on. It could be a stop gap weapon for you, but if you are wanting to stick with a level action you would do well to seek out something like an anti-armor, two shot, furious or bloodied variant (build notwithstanding) to replace the instigating with once given the opportunity. As far as perks are concerned, as the level action does not have any mods for armor pen, Tank Killer is a can't miss addition to the rifleman perks for its armor pen and stagger effects. Additionally, a perk like Tormentor is a nice addition since you will be hitting relatively hard on a per-shot basis. 
---
Other than that, your perks will be more dependent on your play style than your weapon choice. I use my level action in my VATS/Crit/Sneak build to fantastic results, but before that I primarily used it as a sniper without VATS perks. Its a fairly versatile weapon and doesn't hog too much AP in VATS if you mod it down away from a scope and long barrel. 
---
The confusion is entirely yours. 
---
I mean 6 v 1 isn‚Äôt very fun 
---
Large ones
---
PSA: If the Player 'touches' Ultracite Ore the Scorched Spawn. One can farm Scorched endlessly in Nuke Zones ie: on the Main Highway to Whitespring click on the Ore and fight the waves!
---
This I don't know, I've been wanting to try out the chameleon mutation but from what I've read in here I don't think its for me...or it'll be a long time coming for a test cause I get basically zero Weightless drops (or 1\* I'm kind of over). 
---
More damage means less bullets. Its easier for me to craft beer and repair guns instead of finding ammo. And there is never too much damage
---
this is still wrong. steel scrap weighs 0.05, bulk steel weight 1.5. this means that 30 steel scrap is equal to 1.5. you are literally only gaining space based on the removal of molded plastic. which is the same as just dropping that plastic. with the pack rat perk now steel scrap weighs 0.01 and bulk steel weights 0.38 which makes an even worse rate of exchange
---
I‚Äôve never owned a computer or a mobile phone but noticed the same thing, all this jumping about like kangaroos is really popular.
---
You're yet another "If you don't like everything about it, shut up and stop playing" asshole. Got it. Fuuuck you people are what's wrong with the game industry as a whole right now. 
---
Thanks! Does karma work on here?
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Gotta get that fusion generator my dude, 100 power and sooo quiet.  I think you can buy the plans from enclave but you can also get them as rewards for doing the "powering up whatever" powerplant event.
---
It‚Äôs going to be surviving the elements, rather than pvp. 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve noticed that glitch a few days ago but yesterday finally confirmed what‚Äôs happening.
---
From what I recall, same category ones (IE Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, master rifleman) are additive, but separate types (basically everything else) are multiplicative. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve got a simple Bloodied Gatling gun listed at 490 damage a shot. If I had an explosive one... up that by ~32%! 
---
People have been jump shooting in games for years, it‚Äôs nothing to do with fortnite. Halo was the first game I did it in, harder to hit a moving target.
---
I don't have one so I can't say. I'd suggest going for one of the other ones anyhow, Urban scout/forest or the BOS ones are pretty good and not too hard to get.
---
So does the bot in Camden park
---
Lol fallout 76 mobile sounds fun
---
Ok.
---
Why should I show u awesome build
---
I bought the mod from a vendor a long time ago, I‚Äôve never seen a plan or learned it from scrapping but things change all the time
---
I agree its not fun Its literally called survival mode for a reason... If you cant take the heat, get out of the kitchen.  play in adventure mode. Pvp is a joke for fallout. 
---
Do you have anything interesting to trade? If not, list price is 60 caps, I'll let the 10 of them go for 500.
---
Renaming an item should at least proc a notification before scraping or selling something. Something like: "You named this, you must like it are you sure you wanna sell/scrape it?" I do think we should be able to hide things from the trade window though. Granted I have nothing worth anything, since I accidentally sold my TS lever action.
---
I have the same experience. On xbox
---
I'm sure they have but seems waaaaaay more prevalent in fortnight and now fallout!
---
If only there had been some context, right? Like if someone had specified that they were talking about a single creature in an online RPG and not a large group.
---
If only, right?
---
Coming! 
---
What system are you on? I may have some one star levers sitting on one of my alts. 
---
Of course. I do try to be responsive lol
---
‚ÄúThe fortnite jump‚Äù? Self important much? People have been jumpshoting since the first shooter that had a jump button. 
---
Somehow he‚Äòs dead. Dunno what happened. 
---
I‚Äôve been wanting a pvp mode but if you don‚Äôt have the ability to spawn there‚Äôs something wrong 
---
Nah, i found vault tec suit as best underarmor for me, but it looks ugly. Asking if i can replace it with atom shop version
---
Or this lol. Sounds like way more fun.
---
Hah, no worries towlie.  Thanks for the info, will check into it when I'm on later.
---
I thought it was just mine that was defective! Would shoot aiming far out, BANG, Death!
---
Guess the preview image and all these other people are wrong too. Oh well. As stated. Nothing that important. 
---
You should edit your post to include the platform. 
---
Xbox one 
---
First I'm hearing of a phantom device, or is that the one you get from the Mystery quest line? May have the rewarded one in my Stash still.   
---
I rarely use Stealth Boys or their kin, tend to just hang back and let chameleon/escape artist do their thing
---
Just use the perk that has a chance to cripple, I think there is one for heavy guns as well 
---
Lol I don't play fortnight how's that self important? Just an observation!  Lol
---
Darn. I just encountered my first Mothman there however! 
---
It sounds insanely anecdotal- Or in other words, bullshit until proven otherwise 
---
My rules are record all trades with unknown people and you have to join me so that way I know we're in adventure mode.
---
This outfit always make me think of an SS officer.
---
Still there? 
---
Yes it's from the mistress of mysteries quest line, once you've done it you can craft them using a stealth boy and other various components.
---
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT THANK YOU VERY NUCH :D
---
I have already tried doing this, to mild success. I just say "Bring me back [some item]" and have them do a fetch quest. It's usually something simple, like chems. Then I give them a goodie bag as their reward.
---
Other than quests disappearing if you change servers, or maybe you were in the middle of something that is now going to have to be reset because you jumped servers.
---
If you have to switch servers to avoid something, then it's broken. Your argument is invalid lol.
---
Yes.  Still here.
---
Coming now thanks! 
---
When you get those items you find plans to make them.  When you get Daisycutter you don‚Äôt find plans for it. 
---
Never heard of that thing I think, is it the yellow and blue tracksuit?
---
Do you still have him?
---
Power armor frames could be changed to simply remove the auto-recall when in camp, I think.
---
I hope we get something like it for the pioneer part of the dlc
---
Much appreciated but I‚Äôm on the station haha 
---
Thanks, too bad people took this poorly haha
---
I feel your pain
---
I think it should be an option something that you can opt into, cause you know there are PvP players or loners who don't want their camps found.  
---
Something like this. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7bdn7/updated\_idea\_homesteads/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7bdn7/updated_idea_homesteads/)
---
What about the traveling merchant deathclaw?
---
Haha ok. Got any extra top hat plans? 
---
How dare them! If I got at least one person with this, I‚Äôm happy lol
---
An instigating lever should kill most mobs in one hit if you invest in the rifleman perks. It's definitely a solid gun. Try getting a supressor for it and invest in some sneak. Instigating/explosive is one of the most coveted guns available.  You have half of one right now!
---
What do you consider interesting?
---
I definitely think we should be able to hide stuff. What would it hurt?
---
lol, that place is the devil. 
---
If you need a hand I'll be on later tonight (8:00 central time) Ps4 thegunguyinc heavy gunner build
---
Sounds great! I should be able to that in a few hours. Thanks! :)
---
Yeah and I still wanted the floating effect so I had to do foundation strategically lol my plan was to put chairs under the workshop to just hang out on but ran out of budget lol
---
No, it‚Äôs Opposite Day
---
Well let‚Äôs see if the RNG god will give me one lol
---
It's also advertised there. Thanks 
---
I didn‚Äôt delete anything wdym?
---
Naw, it was funny
---
You just have to have your weapon out and stop moving. The only allowable armor pieces are ones with the weightless legendary effect. 
---
Chameleon mutation doesn't require crouching, just a drawn weapon and standing still. Also nor armor or all weightless pieces. Chameleon armor is invisible when crouching and still. 
---
I am still waiting to get the 2 sets of Power Armor from you, after the last time I asked I figure I should just stop
---
Chameleon armor- 
---
-(Note that this part is things I‚Äôve heard, not confirmed) In PVE, chameleon armor is a 20% stealth rating bonus per piece.
---
-only works while crouched. 
---
-stays active when firing.
---
-doesn‚Äôt work while moving.
---
-makes a noise when it activates/deactivates.
---
Chameleon mutation-
---
-requires no armor (or weightless armor)
---
-makes no noise
---
-works while standing or crouched, must have weapon out, but doesn‚Äôt work while moving.
---
-does make a rather large visual shimmer when it triggers
---
-breaks when fired.
---
Stealthboy-
---
-works while moving
---
-costs caps to use (gotta buy more)
---
-idk anything else. Noise? Breaks when firing? Not sure
---
On top of the glue farms mentioned you can hunt Anglers and honey beasts both of these enemies drop adhesive.
---
Absolutely nothing. Also I could hide my embarrassingly large number of notes and holotapes I carry around for no reason. I feel like I need them, but that doesn't mean I need the world to know I have a problem.
---
I believe they need better level scaling. At level 30, a level 20 Deathclaw was scary. At level 50, level 90 Deathclaws weren't that scary. Still mess me up if unprepared sometimes, but overall underwhelming.
---
How do you do a non VATS build but still use crits?
---
You need to use VATS to build and use crits 
---
Those new industrial purifier skins look so cool
---
A br fallout style? That would be great.
---
save anything 2* and up
---
Powering up Poseidon. I got lost but eventually finished it myself. I'm on PC.
---
The ‚ÄòSniper‚Äô perk card increases the time you can hold your breath while sniping, also the rifleman perks add damage. As others have said ‚ÄòTank Killer‚Äô is must have. Add agility cards like the one that increases sneak damage as your first shot is probably going to start a firefight and ‚Äòbloody mess‚Äô in the luck tree adds 5% bonus damage.
---
Belching Betty usually has T-51b when I visit there. If you‚Äôre on PC, I have some legs and a torso that I could sell you. Modded and with the Nuka paint, of course. 
---
Also in Flatwoods, over at the tents near the Red Rocket station, there's a couple of radstag carcasses - that'll give you +carry-weight meat even if someone already killed all the brahmins around there.  
---
I run a sneaky rifle build. Currently have a junkies/explosive lever. It's only a lvl 35 and it shreds mobs. Instigating/exp lever is my dream gun!
---
Hi there! I have the VTU Tracksuit and so far I have been unable to craft upgrades for it as I have no idea where plans for it are 
---
Google it
---
Chameleon armor makes a little sound when it activates (not sure if others can hear it). Chameleon mutation does a shimmer effect and color to black-and-white back to color during the transition. I think the mutation activates quicker than the armor. 
---
First time I played survival I took to some hills above the Whitespring. I was scoping out some nearby players when I heard a sound. Shit, I thought, this is it. I quickly took cover and repositioned myself to see whatever threat I heard approaching.
---
Then, to my surprise, fucking prize bot. Pulled out my knife and murdered him for blowing up my spot.
---
Remove the experimental MIRV mod if you have it equipped
---
The mod is most likely your point of death, since it spawns multiple mini nukes - it goes awry vety quickly
---
I think he‚Äôs on a timer and dies when the timer expires 
---
Cheers for all of the great detail here - and that video was stellar.  I think I will try and rank it up and see how I like it... ty!
---
Hopefully we can both get one 
---
Lol. No idea. All my guns have scopes. 
---
That's probably the answer i needed. Thanks
---
Cross bows would be so good for stealth 
---
No, not correct.
---
And your mistake here is confusing thin skin with a blindness to lack of empathy. I know several marines. The don‚Äôt have your attitude. You were never a marine, boy.
---
Finished with you now. Little punk.
---
Of course they did. The topic of F2P is an instant way to collect downvotes. It was however, the perfect amount of believably to grab instant reactions before the fact that April 1st kicked in.
---
Ahh ok that explains everything! Think he just exploded. The Guards and the Brahmin weren‚Äôt hostile tho.
---
Nothing has come up for this week 
---
You can wear armor with the weightless legendary effect. 
---
Walk everywhere, you may be tempted to fast travel if you have the caps or have the locations, but there is a lot to see and experience along the path.
---
Also, the train stations have a map with little Pins in it.
---
If you aim your crosshair *right* on each pin and click, it will mark that train station on your map so at the very least you have a marker to walk to.
---
There are also lookout towers, that if you get to the tops of them then go to the balcony, it will have the "survey area" option.  This will mark several undiscovered locations in the area on your map.
---
I don't like them either, but they're optional and you can ignore them just fine. The game won't punish you if you don't do them.
---
I've seen this with silo codes dropping from scorched officers. Its been in the game since beta.
---
Oh ok
---
I really can‚Äôt wait to finally just set my T-51 and T-60 stuff out to sell. And the serums. Need to get more room in my stash...
---
Seeing Todd talk about the game like this does help keep hope up that there will be lots of content for a while to come.
---
You can just farm them at the overseer camp. Just behind the truck on the road is a random encounter spot. Might take 30 mins of server hopping, but you‚Äôll get it and a few more goodies from the different encounters. 
---
Somebody with plague walker walked by 
---
Like offers on each side and accepting what you see? I just remember all the scamming in runescape before they implemented a lot of blinks and confirmation screens and 76 is definitely touchy to the point where I‚Äôd be worried I‚Äôd get scammed. Main concern being the bug when you‚Äôre changing the price of something or offering an item and whatever the other person clicks request on changes the item your on in trade menu. If that wasn‚Äôt too confusing I hope you got my point hahaha. 
---
I‚Äôd like to add on another note that I like the similarities of the grind between RuneScape and 76. Took me awhile to realize why I love f76 so much and that‚Äôs why. (Queue loading screen music from 2007 when they added the hunter skill) 
---
I'm a brand new player and last night someone came across my camp (which thus far is a foundation and some workstations) and left me a bag of goodies. 
---
It made my entire evening and you best believe I'm rocking that skirt they left for the foreseeable future.
---
Thanks for what you guys do. &lt;3
---
They're also horrible when you run a melee build and they won't land so you can smack their dumb heads in...
---
In theory, server hopping works. However, in practice, I found that there often wasn't a server to hop to. At least on PS4 at the times I was able to play. There were multiple times where I'd run through the events that were available on the server (mostly Leader of the Pack, One Violent Night, and Uranium Fever) then circle through West-Tek. Then I'd try to hop servers and come right back to the same server time after time after time. It seems to happen at times when not many people are playing, which makes sense. But if there were only 10 or 15 people on the server (and that happened a lot) no amount of server hopping would work. You just ended up right back where you were.
---
Of course, my results were probably further hampered by the fact that I was actively trying to avoid PVP. So I didn't always go to Uranium Fever or One Violent Night (especially UE) because they turn into bloodbaths as soon as the event ends. Leader of the Pack, since it covers a lot more ground, seemed less dangerous overall. But even there this morning I got ganked by some dude with a tesla rifle that had been camping the farm up north where the one wolf boss spawns in. 
---
Wish I did I came even find that one myself sadly
---
Interested in joining  WanderingMerc.  Unfortunately not to familiar with reddit. 
---
I keep all my holos and notes too.. I just leave them in my stash as they weigh zero. I do keep a few notes on me that i need (passwords and such) but that's about it. It makes Selling sooo much easier.
---
&gt; two shot
---
NO, just no to that. It misses a lot in VATS. 
---
&gt; furious 
---
Dear lord no, furious with a slow reloading rifle is as useful as a minigun with instigating.
---
Also for a rifleman instigating is excellent. It makes it so you can one-shot pretty much everything. 
---
There's no need to fire a second shot if your target is already dead.
---
4-8 shotgun shells and then 8-10 good hammer whacks, I love killing these mofo's.
---
ps4
---
What are the codes 
---
Do you have any serums for Marsupial or Speed Demon? I might take that. Otherwise I am hoarding legendaries for the new legendary vendor, so anything with 2 or more stars at max level is interesting to me :-)
---
If you have any legendary versions of the following, I'm also game to look: any chest armor, power fist, gauss rifle, or lever action rifle.
---
I‚Äôm thinking weather. And hoping that means greenhouses. I like building.
---
I made a stealth pistol character like I do in every fallout game and they one shot me and / or I do no damage to them hardly.
---
I always have to hide or run and it makes the game really pointless for me 
---
Oh the German SS of world war 2
---
np :) Glad i could help a bit.
---
What‚Äôs your weapon and AP? You can view your AP in the pip-boy view you see your SPECIAL in, its in the lower right. I‚Äôve got a melee build that currently has very low AP from a couple mutations, he barely has enough AP for a single power attack
---
Why build a camp. Use a ‚õ∫ tent.
---
AFAIK the phantom device is a stealth boy with the added gas. 
---
I attempted PvP in my PA and got wrecked. Does that Stealth torso mod help?
---
Very good to know, thanks 
---
Get the Can do perk in the luck section.
---
It works on most little blue coolers and trash cans you can find and at max ranks, it almost always gives you something.
---
And the food you get from it is nonperishable so you dont have to worry about spoilage.
---
Also, White knight in agility at max ranks allows for your armor to break 60% slower and repair for fewer materials.
---
Oh it's on the list of things I want, but I'm only level 33 so I haven't quite gotten to the enclave
---
What mods were you using?
---
Haha you fools I will exploit this to get people to come to my groups bar where we will serve them food and drinks and play music! 
---
Cool thanks!

How the heck do you one shot it? They are freaking bullet sponges for me as a lvl 63
---
But what if I need to read that random note left in a house in the forest while I'm roaming around the mire looking for anglers? 
---
^^^^I seriously have a hoarding problem
---
I don‚Äôt have a mic but can hear you. I‚Äôll help out. DM your GT. 
---
Also haven't done the power plant events but it's now on my list to do 
---
I snagged one of those at the store, too, for my Col Clink moods.
---
Ah, gotcha, then your best bet would be to find some people to help you complete the power plant events. I believe this Reddit has a discord for meeting with others.
---
Well, nuke dark was already in the game, so it‚Äôs not really new, we just couldn‚Äôt craft it before. 
---
They're getting solve
---
Didn‚Äôt know this, will have to complete this quest line now 
---
sorry I think i misread your post and am just trying to say the same thing... right now im running rank 3 Demo expert and rank 2 Batt included and get way more mileage for my play vs gunsmith... so yes I agree with you :-) 
---
What?
---
While we are at it, why does .308 crafting yield only x21 with ammosmith, but .50cal &amp; 5mm yield x180. This makes the LMG difficult to keep fed.
---
I had to edit my custom.ini to match the changes in the new fallout.ini. It was a couple new archives added to one of the lists
---
I once got chased by a Scorchbeast down there and accidentally led it straight to Murgle. Poor kitty died and I felt SOOOOOO guilty.
---
Most probably something pvp related. They really want to turn Fallout into some kind of fortnite. They didn't say anything about content so i don't think we'll get any content this summer. Only later this year we're getting the real deal.
---
I usually don‚Äôt use my PA for PvP, but yeah I love having a Stealth Boy mod on it. It does use AP though unlike Chameleon armor pieces. 
---
Yo may want to level up a bit more too. Maybe get to 50? And try it then
---
Me too
---
They have a chance of dropping any one of the three generator plans, but afaik it won't give you duplicates of plans you already know^but ^I ^could ^be ^wrong
---
You thought it was a bug. Then you go online and learn that they originally designed the armor a bit differently in the beginning but for its final release they changed it. And so it has always looked like that in game. They kept an old model for the leg in inventories and drops. Why? Probably because it was part of a dlc and not given the same care as other items in the vanilla release of FO4. 
---
What other pre release design changes to models or systems to you want to argue about and insist that it‚Äôs Supposed it be the first thing that hit the drawing board?
---
I can help! GT KnowledgeHound 
---
If you like that kind of games why do you waste time with this one? There are A LOT of BR games . Just curious....
---
The Mrs nanny that sells nuka cola in the whitespring. I believe that last time I encountered her a few months ago she wasn‚Äôt selling anything at that point, but I could be wrong. 
---
OK - thanks :-) 
---
Cheapest is 9600 caps at vendors. Laughable price
---
There must be other things you can remove to get in besides that door.
---
Still works that way. I make all my shopping runs before I have to hop out and loose the extra 100 lbs of carry weight.
---
I've gotten a few prime receiver plans from random scorchbeast encounters. Usually south of Watoga or at least somewhere in the Bog. 
---
But I agree!!! üò°üò† üòÇüòÖ. The Scorchbeasts are tedious. I do enjoy my stealth sniper being able to take them down really quickly but my heavy guns still dumps quite a bit of .50 Cal ammo into their hides before they flail and bounce around. She used to be melee and that was just an overall terrible experience. I had to convert to heavy guns for SBQ and other scorchbeasts. 
---
Lol yeah. The top hat sells for 34 caps to vendors with hard bargain and costs - get this - ONE cloth to make. 
---
So... You are trading with them? 
---
Hahaha no my shop wilk be open but I will be wandering checking out other vendors.
---
I will have a message if I am not there saying my psn name and to msg me and I'll come back and serve you üòÅ
---
I play apex and before that pubg. I've always liked fallout though. I guess why not?
---
I like that idea a lot. I dump things into the overseerer‚Äôs bin, too, hoping they‚Äôre picked up by newbies
---
Honestly, this post makes me legitimately want to play again for inexplicable reasons. I haven‚Äôt played since December, and had no plans really to return, but this made me want to.
---
Can you nuke your own garden to get flux now? Never tried...asking for a friend
---
I guess it is not a solo stealth game.... almost as if it is some sort of ‚Äúmultiple player‚Äù team game of sorts. 
---
My psn is gnarlstonharl im after some some f076 friends too feel free to add me! Im not on at the moment though 
---
I've been buying cheap light legendaries that have been sold to vendors. 3 star rolling pins for 30 caps, for example. The ledge vendor is meant to give tokens for scrapping ledge items, so heavy stuff will probably give the same amount of  tokens
---
It would have worked if we had some content first. Don't get me wrong, i play the game since BETA and it's not a bad game but i can't say it has enough content. There is so much to do before doing some kind of battle royal thing...
---
No no no - the players want beverage crafting... 
---
Secondary trading screen mang
---
Couldn't agree with you more !!!!! Perfect example.... me and a random vault dweller teamed up for about 2 hours,we farmed westek for the leggy super muties, then on to whitesprings golf course, and finally some event horde's. We both were getting great legendary weapons off of low level guys........... then before we both went our separate ways we decided to go scorch beast hunting........
---
 9 million rounds , and too many stimpacks later we killed 2 level 50's, and a level 80 with nothing to show for it haha , last time for me to mess with them until theres a serious change in loot dropping from the s.b.'s ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
Don‚Äôt forget drinks that teleport you
---
Looks great!
---
Nice job!
---
If you look at the fermenter CAMP item the text when you select something to ferment is actually "select item for display" I think this is the hint as to how this will work, so things like shelves you will be able to activate, and select items from your stash to display.  The Item will be shown on the shelf and be one solib combined item, so nobody can loot it from you and even destroying it, it'll still actually be in your stash.
---
It usaly just comes down to can I kill them befor they hit me. If a level 90 DC hits me I'm dead lol
---
Also hell yes you finally made me realize why i like both games for the same reason :)
---
It's a stealthboy that frenzies nearby mobs
---
You can also get a really nice veil that works similarly to a gas mask, 
---
a Chinese officers sword with 50% armor penetration, 
---
A snub nose .44 that does additional damage to robots, 
---
a dress that takes up outfit and underarm or slots but increases player stealth, 
---
And a ruby brooch that increases the effects of all the previously listed items
---
It's also a pretty fun quest line to go through.
---
I think the Nuka Cola and Water Treatment Facility should have workshops. 
---
Its funny coz VATS
---
Agree with your points here and the idea behind a solution.
---
Glass cannons nowadays.  They hit hard, but if you cripple their legs, they're a joke.  
---
With a dastardly plan like that, you should be a raider.
---
I had a level 11 start beating on me a few weeks back, but it didn‚Äôt do a thing. I threw down a couple pieces of level 10 armor and weapons and walked away. Enabling bad behavior in a simulation world is fun.

Don't forget about lemonade vendor
---
I think I found the shrine but there were no eggs to be found
---
I only took a quick look but the weapons didnt seem special enough (for me) to take the time to work toward them.  
---
I'm just glad so far no TSE weapons have popped in the list, because there is already way the hell too many of them circulating.
---
They also spawn on the monorail elevator just north of the fort. Take the elevator to the top and walk through the train cars. I got the brown &amp; green hats off of there
---
You feel very strongly about this. Lol
---
I asked a question. It's not something I would know in the game. It still doesn't make sense that they wouldn't fix it or simply change the model for the inventory screens. Seems lazy. So I would still consider this a bug or error. There's only guesses as to why it's different. And why they wouldn't address it after modders tried to fix it. 
---
But yeah man. Sorry I pissed on your cornflakes this morning. Try and enjoy the rest of your day üëç

I believe he means that he shoots it once so he can collect the loot when the defenses have finished.
---
The RP of our group would make you think that but we are all neutral if we are not using the factions for our own gains...I mean glory to the enclave! 
---
Hes not worth it. He was in the military. Explains a lot.
---
+karma youre welcome
---
Never said I was using crits. I just want to shoot shit in the head. 
---
Took me 3 mins with my level 40 VATS character.
---
Yea the rewards suck (they should all be 3* legendaries tbh), but they‚Äôre not extremely hard to fight.
---
They would be balanced if they were 3 stars.
---
Constant rad storm. 24 hours a day. 
---
I would pay good money to know the exact number, if this is true
---
Oh, boo hoo
---
It would also make interactions at workshops more vital and interesting. I could see a lot more PvP going down for these places but there could easily be more teamwork to.

Not sure if you tried this but you can click on the camp object and select repair all. There‚Äôs no need to manually click everything. I suppose you could be talking about replanting so that you don‚Äôt have to use the mats to repair plants, but just in case :)
---
 I can pinpont exactly why either as it is different, but the style itself just has that same feel.
---
I‚Äôm level 150 and have only used lever actions throughout the game past level 45... from levels about 80 to 110 I used a level 35 instigating with +50% limb damage and it totally wrecked almost all enemies with just 3 points in rifleman, sneak attack perks, and tank killer. That first instigating shot with sneak bonus is huge damage for a single shot. 
---
Other types I use are anti armor and bloodied... never used two shot much, but they seem pretty popular still, I‚Äôd say they were a bit overrated to be honest. My main now is an instigating with +50% vat crit damage, and a bloodied with same effect. 
---
Even a level 35 instigating is a solid weapon for a sneaky sniper player. 
---
Isn't that what a crit build is? Like in your title?
---
And if you want some sort of mechanical advantage to headshots than VATS is pretty much it. Otherwise it just comes down to your personal skill. 
---
This is not true. I have been lead directly to people on the top 3 that were camped out somewhere crouching the entire time, still showed them on the map. It‚Äôs just buggy with when it decides to show someone or not.
---
Looks good dude! I wish they had log cabin walls. Also wanted a rock wall to put around the property!
---
None as far as I'm aware. Also, you may find [this](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Excavator+Power+Armor) helpful.
---
I actually noticed it was a spaceship after I commented so you accomplished what you set out to do, I'm just not a fan of floating camps personally.
---
"Does someone need me to kick their ass!?"
---
Not the point, but good outlook i guess.
---
Right my title says (non vats / crit build). No vats, no crits. Just me sniping mobs in the face.

The codes dont reset until 5PM PST. Once solved after reset they auto-update there.

Good to know thanks for the tips

Haha yeah they‚Äôre funny. Certainly got my ass handed to me.
---
It certainly seemed to for the three dozen short hunting rifles I used to hobble back to my camp with
---
The other day I picked something up that said silo code something, are these the nuke codes? I found it on a ghoul with a backpack on... new player here 
---
I'm hoping it will be a harsher, more dangerous pve mode. Maybe the map completely filled with high level mobs and "expert" versions of places like the Penitentiary. I don't know if they'll want to keep separating the playerbase though.
---
Not everyone paid 60 bucks. I did and that's why i hold off buying any atoms and stuff. I am glad they are still working on it but they got a lot of money from me for the game that they sold me back in November 2018
---
You have to admit though, they are a LOT better now they they were before, having limits on the screech attack makes it at least a bearable encounter whereas before so many people had to just close their eyes and run.
---
I hope they add somekinda message if your house is vandalized just in case the icon attracts raiders.
---
dude you are fukin lucky i was chilling at my camp and random 200 level guy show up and guess what happened ? he killed me for 14-15 times and wasted all of my caps :(
---
Yeah, 1 bulk cloth = 1000 caps
---
Nice job. I love building, too, and never blueprint because I build each camp custom for the spot it‚Äôs in. I think the budget grows with your level. It seems like I can build more now at level 85 than I could at 30... but never looked at the numbers, just watched the bar. Started building in areas with lower level baddies to spend less on turrets and more on a cool place.
---
Ah yes, the timeless spawn rape.
---
Place your camp right next to the train station that‚Äôs nearest to the part of the map you explore often.
---
For me, it‚Äôs WS.
---
It will cut down on the spawn rape, and allow you to get to your area of play safer.
---
I have no idea what the actual number is. All I know is that if I empty all the desks without doing anything else, and come back a few days later, the desks will still be empty. But if I run around to other locations and loot everything I can between here and there and go back they reset.
---
Calibrated Shock mod will sell for sure.  
---
Will take time but the vanguard BoS chest will find a buyer.  
---
The cloaking chest piece maybe.  
---
The rest of it you‚Äôll be hard pressed, especially the vanilla weapons and armor 
---
I have a 2x2 foundation tower. So my first floor is the stairs with the platform attached. The stairs allow walls to be attached to them For whatever reason once you attach a floor to the stairs anything walls you remove cannot be put back on. 
---
My front door is the keypad door. If I delete the wall next to it I can‚Äôt put it back. I would have to move my entire camp and rebuild to add that wall back. If you try to manually take apart my 4 story tower it does not allow you to remove stairs or floor pieces. Which means so have to pay to move the whole camp to rebuild it. 
---
I‚Äôve had to rebuild about 20 times do to accidentally removing one of the walls from the stairway. 
---
I haven‚Äôt played since Wednesday and want to go back. 
---
No. We *finally* have the ability to wear outfits and not have to cover them up with armor. We‚Äôve come so far only for them to screw it back up. 
---
Why the downvotes though? He is right.
---
That, most likely, was a Colonel Gutsy, and yes. They will keep kicking your ass if you are not careful. 
---
Their fire-rate, precision and armor-piercing is... impressive.
---
Yes.
---
Awesome, thanks! I just got the handmade plans and I would rather *not* waste the materials crafting lvl 50s just to turn around and scrap them if I don't have to.
---
It was indeed a colonel gutsy. 
---
Lol with vats and my 2 shot one bullet hits and the other flys way off target!
---
Here's the back story on the posh cockroach

---
I don't like some of the challenges either, but i won't cry about it. They are not mandatory and can be easily ignored. They probably know we're sick of alcohol and shit and expect us to buy atoms with cash instead of doing the challenges.
---
The way you bash at anyone who criticizes the game is as sickening as the hateful posts that drop their meaning and become personal.  
---
I've been on board with F76 from the beginning, paying full price for the game and Breaking It Early Anyway. I too fell for the hype Todd was able to pull off... it's going to be 16 times the size of F4 and you'll be able to play it with your friends as well as by yourself. Massive PR bullshit but it didn't matter, because I love the Fallout universe. Months later into the game they really managed to piss me off so badly I actually stopped playing. Hearing you fanboys saying "but it hasn't crashed in months"... let me sincerely doubt that; it truly doesn't crash/disconnect ... when you don't play it. And speaking of playing, how about the beautiful slap in the face (actually more like a boot in the throat) with patch 5, which destroyed all my ranged weapons, my legit 1 star ranged weapons ??? I'm not going to play Skyrim 76. If you're all going to be walking around hammering nails that's your choice. I choose not to do that.  If they stepped on my neck and trashed my progress by nerfing my guns to the ground... who says when I'll respec they won't choose that idiotic approach again ? I see they're more preoccupied with PvP in the past few months. I'm actually looking forward to see how they will mess up more... because I smell more nerfs incoming after the PvP server fiasco. So don't tell me how wonderful the game is right now. It's not. It still needs a fuckton of attention if Bethesda is willing to find the resources to turn it around. Which I really hope they do. Because I still believe this WAS a game with IMMENSE POTENTIAL (especially on the social side) that was so rushed it actually makes me question how Bethesda is actually seeing their loyal customers.
---
I think there may be some mods you have to be a certain level to learn (.38 combat rifle receiver types), but don't think the level of the gun matters.
---
I have been collecting plans, chems, food, and alcohol since wild Appalachia started! Cant wait to open Chewydogs Filthy Emporium 
---
Yeah you have to find 24 and decrypt them or you can look them up 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm crazy bummed that mine got bumped last week. I spent a couple hours on it and used it as a fast point and brew spot for the Bib dailies. Without warning it‚Äôs gone and I forgot to blueprint it so I would have to recreate it from scratch.
---
Atm my camp is just a cooking spit in the grass so I could fast travel again. 
---
max damage perks, max sneak, instigating + under 40% hp +50% dmg boost, + each successive hit does more damage, drops scorchbeasts real quick, and even at level 90 i don't see level 85 scorchbeasts, only 50-65.
---
Yeah, I've heard that too. Thank you!
---
Yea, I never bother locking the stuff on my camp because it seems like a waste of time, plus if I can help someone then I count that as a win
---
The 52 gutsy is the most murderous thing in Appalachia. 
---
For DPS you want an [automatic rifle](https://i.imgur.com/1m6FH4L.png) \- commando perks, tank killer, bloody mess, sneak, escape artist, covert operative, mister sandman, adrenaline. For single-shot (bolt/semi) snipe damage take the rifleman perks instead of commando (instigating weapons are better suited for the "one shot, one kill" approach). In either case I've included sneak and escape artist as "must have" perks because in both offense and defense the dark side is your greatest source of power.
---
*"I do my work by the light of the moon."* \- Dean Koontz
---
Does resistance to plasma reduce their screech damage or is it fire resist? 
---
Agreed, and I'm hoping that Bethesda is paying attention to player feedback (they certainly seem to be) about the linear progression.  That's the biggest concern of most randos I encounter in the game.  I personally don't mind the linear story, but I grew up on JRPGs so ... yeah.  I definitely can understand the frustration in that regard as 76 definitely (currently) has less divergent story paths.  
---
I think the reason is the online nature of the game.  It would be hard to represent multiple storylines when everyone is playing one communal, over-arching storyline.
---
That's not to say they won't figure out a way ;)
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox too, got a shop selling them...

Yeah haha I‚Äôll be a little more respectful next time we meet.
---
Turns out in another thread this happens when you move the physical c.a.m.p object and the spawn point is invalid. LITTLE LEWISBURG IS BACK
---
Okay, what exactly are you defining as the ‚Äúfortnite jump‚Äù? Do the shooters you play not have jumping in them?
---
I played with 400 lbs stash. 800 is just fine. I'm fine if they decide to never increase the limit.
---
Honestly with the theme of Fallout 4 and the origin of the player characters you'd think people would be more willing to help out with their camps 
---
Just have him die and it will all drop?
---
Besides by the time you go back they'll most likely be refreshed unless you're checking like every five minutes 
---
That would be "non crit/non vats" or "non crit or vats". You really don't see the confusion?
---
If you just want to shoot shit, there are only 2 that really help your aim. Sniper (Per lvl 28) for rifles and  Crack Shot (Per lvl 7) for pistols 
---
And the best part (for me) is that some of the story is still unknown and will progress as the game develops. :)
---
Just made the video. Id show you in person but I am xb1. Its uploading atm and ill comment a link to it once its done.
---
They are separate. You'll have to make a new character.
---
Oh holy shit! That‚Äôs exactly what I did! I was tired of spawning into the mountain and moved my little camp device. I didn‚Äôt realize I made my spawn point invalid. 
---
Damn too late now to fix it but at least I know now!
---
Huh. Opposite issue for me. I'm on the north end of the map, and whenever I kill super mutants they are either armed with pipe guns or charging laser rifles (not counting melee weapons). But they're only shooting bullets at me, not lasers.   
---
I'm not minding as this is the easiest way to scrap laser weapons until I have all the mods, but yeah, they be broken.

Thank you, sir, for your informative post, sorry I don't have the plans you are looking for.

Actually just passed that mission last night and it was the causal factor in me thinking about it and making this post...so well done like-minded individual. ;)
---
brilliant thank you 
---
Has there been any info on how this will work yet?    
---
Are you in the acid cave? 
---
Yo whyd you just straight up steal my outfit in a trade?
---
Let me check my stash. I think i might have it. 
---
I love it! I was thinking about how cool having a ‚Äúnote‚Äù board on my front porch would be. With all the notes I‚Äôve collected in game kinda like one of those ‚Äúmissing boards‚Äù you see in zombie movies.
---
Your idea is much better lol 
---
Yeah I have never equipped to build power armor mods. It makes crafting pieces much cheaper though.
---
If he is where I think he is the turrets won't be enough
---
Another cool idea would be to have a frame of the pictures you took and have them either on the wall or on a table or shelf.
---
Yeah. In my experience enemies always had the weapons on them that they were attacking you with in ALL of those games.
---
Having some sort of vendor beacon would be neat, once you build it your camp could be visible on the map, you can sell items at terminals and it costs caps to travel to your camp, giving you 50% of the caps from being traveled to ( letting them have a travel cap storage limit of like 250 caps though )
---
that happens a lot for me, almost as if the game is attempting to auto aim.. at a random spec of dust, it ends when i stop aiming down sights and aim back down
---
Soon*
---
*Soon is a trademark of Bethesda Games Studios and its affiliates.
---
Now we know to check first. Good luck with your building! I imagine we should move camp around, make sure that's the right spawn we want, then server hop to see if it sticks
---
Lol. Go get it. There are at least three random spawn points that can spawn the dead civil war reenactor. He will have one of 7 costume plans on him. This is one of them. 
---
I had my camp in that cave. The constant flapping drove me out. I had a badass setup in there while it lasted though.
---
That is a hell of a place to set up and grind XP though
---
the Chassis used to provide damage resistance, i think in an update they removed that. was the same update that removed scrapping spare chassis for actual resources
---
Well that‚Äôs you‚Äôre opinion but if you haven‚Äôt played in a while then I think it would be unwise to comment on the stability of the game. I‚Äôm not a fanboy but this is just how I view the game. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had a bad experience because of a weapons nerf. I‚Äôm not sure what else you Bethesda to do other than release a road map of what‚Äôs to come. I personally think they are doing a good job at this point but if you disagree you‚Äôre welcome to your opinion just like I have my own. 
---
At one point I was coming out of RobCo and had not noticed that the AWOL-event was going on outside. I ran into a swarm of 8 Colonel Gutsies. Needless to say it was a very short fight.
---
Not prepared, but Ill come help with the ads.
---
Lol when was this ? This just happened coupled days ago 
---
Someone commented we will find out more Thursday. I think that's their pre patch into the vault, and then we will know tuesday, assuming it wont get pushed back. 
---
yep! you'll probably just want to wire it to a switch if you want a cleaner way to hide your camp, but otherwise people will know you're there. 
---
Server hop horde events
---
Mostly the shooting downward at the top of your marsupial jump! Lol seen a YouTube video how to shoot like ninja! 
---
I paid like 7 EUR :)

More importantly that is a sunk cost paid regardless if they deliver additional content or not.

In that respect it‚Äôs free in the economic sense of the word (or as free as anything can be in an economic sense).

I'm off! ^or ^at ^least ^I ^will ^be ^in ^like ^an ^hour
---
Definitely the calibrated shock. 
---
Its not tough. Its not difficult. Its grindy because of the "needs to be starred" stipulation. Its grindy because it only lasts a week. I didnt say anything needed to be changed, i didnt say the game needs to cater to me. People need to stop telling me about my life, theres worse gripes on this sub than mine, and i can vent if i desire. So many posts on this sub are of snowflakes crying the game needs to be changed, thats not what this is, so I should be able to share a simple frustration without any sassy backlash. I do play the game. A game thats rated M. By your logic, the game caters to 14 year olds that can play 20 hours a day.
---
Most others have shared words of advice to try and aid in the completion of this "tough" challenge. But theres also a few like you that offer nothing of real value, just a cocky response. Dont act like i should get off my high horse when youre sitting pretty on yours.
---
Wheres the "tough" challenges for those of us who can hardly play? Ive paid for this game too, ya know.
---
Hopefully we just get our spawn point to build in our camps at some point. I would love to just chose my spawn point in my camp without having to possibly wreck my camp to move it
---
Like I said, we'll see. Don't hold your breath thinking legendary armor is going to change much anytime soon. It's not an exploit to have good armor. The legendary vendor is coming soon too, which might make the good stuff a little more available. 
---
me neither. but most people's floating camps aren't floating. its just attatched to stairs and foundation 
---
I do it all the time. But how does the game know im intoxicated?
---
Good hunting. 
---
Is anything new coming tomorrow?
---
That would be awesome. I didnt get to play the skyrim mod but I really wanted too
---
Yeah I need to walk more in the game. I've been needing more and more things for cooking and realizing I have no idea where they grow because they grow between places I normally fast travel between.
---
That's my favorite place to get irradiated mushrooms!
---
Vats crits. 
---
Cool! Nice the multi-room setting. May I suggest scrapping some turrets in benefit of some furniture?
---
Dont beleieve so, next week looks like a patch with the new quest line and player vending. 
---
"I suppose you're wondering why I summoned you all here today... "
---
Nice looking camp
---
Wait.
---
It's less buggy now then it was at launch, but it's still an empty game with no content. A beautiful map with nada. Like imagine loading up Fallout 4 or Skyrim, but running a mod that deleted all NPCs but left the monsters. That empty lonely, uneventful game...That's Fallout 76.  
---
If Bethesda announces with the Wastelanders expansion that they're adding in NPCs, quests, and a STORY, then yes, buy it on sale. But don't spend over $50 on it EVER. 
---
I‚Äôm curious as to the one shot kill thing. What kinda gun is able to one shot kill anything? I mean I have one of those zealot guns and even at that it takes about 15 shots to bring down a queen
---
i think it was last November, in beta the unarmored chassis used to provide a small damage resist bonus, and could be scrapped for ballistic fiber
---
I play payday 2, cod ,battlefield,gta,max Payne 3,borderlands 2 and fallout. The jump im referring to iv only seen in fortnight clips lol
---
18 hours a day every day from the release date till currently.  Even if you were home and doing nothing that's a dam near impossible time of played days without you spending the last 3 years just playing and leaving the system on while you slept and did other things.
---
I dont buy it man, maybe you played a ton fine.....but 900 days of played time, or 29k+ hours, that isn't something people are able to sustain for that long.
---
And you only played 1 game in all that time? Seems off.  You sure you weren't just inflating numbers to make a point.
---
If you have a 1 and they share a 2, you‚Äôll get a 2. Maybe that‚Äôs what you saw?
---
My apologies, didnt mean to confuse anyone. No vats. No crits with vats. I just want to sneak up to a place and snipe manually. Just want the max dps for the build without vats. 
---
I don't think the decision was "let's not have any NPCs forever," I think it was more like "Let's release with everyone dead for story purposes and then GRADUALLY have NPCs emerge from vaults."  I'm willing to wait to find out. :)
---
Grafton Monster at Grafton Day?
---
He moves but usually directly towards you. You can cheese the AI so that he stays still while you hide in a room.
---
Also works for crafting them. It's a shitty grind mechanic, but it works and is about the only option for certain guns like the UC Laser rifle. 
---
whyd you steal my western outfit incel?
---
I agree but maybe he has upgrades or his build is setup for it. Either way, glad we got the answer and thanks for the hints too everyone!
---
They are crap, i just want them because theyre named.
---
I still havent recovered from playing Fo4 haha
---
Don't forget the whitespring golf areas
---
Please give us a Tom Leahr song!
---
yo whyd you straight up steal my outfit in a trade?
---
Amazing!
---
You can build a character to be a critical hit monster. No one is penalized for not building a character that focuses on crits. Sneaking or use of a stealth boy also negates the ability to VATs target someone do again there are ways around being hit with a crit.
---
I think spawn camping is a problem but I constantly see people basically complaining they are getting beat by another type of build. If you are, find a way around the weakness. I really don't want Bethesda to keep nerfing damage. If people want a 100% level weapon and armor playing field, they picked the wrong game.
---
I dont want that at all lol
---
If something cant just be resumed after switching servers the game system is broken.
---
You still make a choice,  deal with the griefing to finish your task or go to new server and start that task over.  It doesnt make the system not broken, but it does mean you have a choice.
---
Right! I think it could make factions viable. If you are part of the BOS you can help out with BOS conquered workshops. If you are a Raider you can attack and try to steal the materials and loot.  Each person in the faction gets rewarded for defending it and gets parts of the loot when it produces something. It would be much more compelling game play for sure!
---
I LOVE using the Tattered Mole Outfit, it scares the living hell out of low levels, even though all I do is follow them around sometimes &gt;:)
---
Well Saturday I was getting 60 damage plus 60 energy resistance and it has effected all my PA and it‚Äôs pretty crappy. Idk hoe having a guy mod it affected it but yeah.
---
For sure!
---
Good question. Logically it should, but I don't know that much about it since I never had any dealings with dupers or friends of dupers before.  It never really occurred to me to suggest and he didn't either.  Perhaps someone in the know will read this and answer that.  I'm not even sure how much inventory the destroy option allows since I've never hit the limit yet and don't plan to. He wasn't quite ready to part with his hoarded stuff just yet anyway, so he didn't want to select the destroy option and test it. 
---
A PC mod called Better Inventory is what you need. It does that.
---
This would be so nice, I don't want to go hunt for one or two plants just to make a certain type of booze when I can get everything else at my camp
---
The assaultron helmet is pretty cool. Currently rockin a face mask so cant use it at the moment but keep it on hand. 
---
You should invest in a horse bit and some handcuffs and mind your own business.
---
If you feel like you have to craft some just remember to have Super Duper on. It never occurred to me that it applied to weapons too until I wound up with multiple submachine guns
---
That is a great pic. 
---
I did it just fine as a level 43 or something like that. 50 is a bit excessive. But definitely a level up or 10 wouldn't hurt. Lol
---
Tbf deathclaws in any modern fallout were jokes with crippled legs. Only scary in packs which is what 76 and 4 lack. You're spot on about the attack animations. Those really did make a big difference. Wish they could somehow add them back in but I'm sure it wasn't trivial.
---
listen buddy
---
Also any new chassis I find is the same way only get 2 damage and 2 energy resistance no matter what 
---
Yes, it's coming in 4/9's patch
---
gunpowder weighs a ton.
---
Level 15(25?) is the minimum level that it builds at. Save your materials and always build lowest level. But you'll still need screws. (Damnit Bethesda, include screws in scrapping guns ya bastards!)
---
No kidding?? That's bad ass!
---
I've been modding every armor with ultra lightweight when possible, and a lot of the weapons come with mods on them that add weight, but you can mod them back to standard lighter weight parts for storage. I mean, there's materials cost to it, but it's better to spend the materials than to have to ditch half the stuff.
---
&gt;  Don't hold your breath thinking legendary armor is going to change much anytime soon. 
---
I'm going by his exact words in the video. They allowed geared up, high level players into survival mode to see how bad they can break it so that it it can be fixed.  He mentioned legendary armor specifically. I think that's more reason to believe that legendary armor will be changed than to think it won't. 
---
And the armor's prefixes don't have to change at all. The effect that weapons have on them can be buffed.  
---
Resetting the timer so they won't show up on the map.
---
Marsupial? Jetpack? 
---
The Wild Appalachia patch has sucked me back in, but th lack of new plants is taking away from the enjoyment. 
---
i may have to check my power armor without any pieces, because last time i checked all of mine provided no resistances un-armored
---
Perception 15 with all 9 maxed rifleman cards, 3 sniper and 3 tank killer
---
Luck 6 with tormentor 3 and bloody mess 3 
---
Maybe some into charisma for tenderizer 
---
Those I've got in spades. It's the steel that's killing me.
---
This is happening to me too, and it‚Äôs fairly annoying because my firecracker berries that I have for Rose‚Äôs Syringer are about to expire 
---
Check the top floor for the roof access door.
---
Its the only game ive actually played I thought about other but the only real franchise I liked are elder scrolls fallout and dmc
---
We are a team and it seems to want to force us into all using similar builds with power armour and stuff. Yawn. 
---
Ohhh man well I had 622 damage resistance on my t51 now it 564 kinda pissed me off lemme know tho. Far as I heard everyone else‚Äôs is plus 60 each 
---
After reading this I went out and found two. Scrapped one and got no new mods from it but had already bought the Long Bar mod from Watoga. Applied that and it's just a little larger. Same 20 DMG. My stash space it precious so it's headed to the scrap pile.
---
The main problem is the Sentinel effect working while jumping. If they fix that I'd be happy. 
---
Like I've said, probably won't change much anytime soon, but we'll see.  Not holding breath. 
---
So they have not caught (again) the purpose of the game ... however I saw a guy killing himself many times in a few seconds while other people are higher in the rank... still not understand...
---
Hope not.
---
I know they recently messed with the cost of certain things towards the budget but I'm not sure about increasing the amount allowed. I also just look at the bar lol
---
In that case you should really try more games.....lots are incredibly well made, far better actually then fo76 is in its current state.
---
I saw a base with turrets near the WS station, as soon as you would spawn the turrets would fire, luckily I ran inside to take out the generator only to discover the shotgun turrets LOL. My friend and I had to take down the base multiple times coz it kept shredding everyone who spawned at the station :(
---
Three weeks? I've been playing whenever I can for months and I just hit level 31 this evening.
---
Good to know, thanks! 
---
If I got some people with it, then I‚Äôm happy haha
---
im at 600+ on both. with mutations that is
---
Luckily my base is above the munitions factory, so unless someone owns it, no one comes after me when I‚Äôm top 3, although I have heard people trying to get in &gt;:)
---
It is junk so I would think it would all go into a bag at his feet.
---
Need the plan sorry 
---
I've crafted many of the lowest level lever action rifles and handmade rifles to just scrap and learn mods and it's great when the super duper perk goes off while making them 
---
IT'S ME!
---
yeh i get it.now just weird that a explosive 2 shot does a lot more damage than a non explosive 2 shot.but demo expert lvl 5 only adds 10%
---
I would actually prefer if they used 50's themed music specifically written for the fallout world. There is so much potential for new music written from an in world perspective it is crazy
---
I don‚Äôt have any mutations that boost it so 
---
It's a fun game! Check the new road map out and check out all the new things coming down the line. FO76 is in a pretty good place right now.
---
Damn. I'm still only a level 14. And haven't done the mission to get into even the 4th floor yet
---
You had my curiosity, now you have my attention. I'm guessing unlike the Chainsaw, this does heinous damage even at low durability. How long do you go between repairs?
---
Should I do something with game files to fix this or ?
---
\*Looks everywhere but on the official site where it goes into detail and has pics.
---
It possible with just marsupial
---
I like the scorchbeast fights. I also like shooting down vertibots and cargobots, even if they give no good rewards either. Something about taking down fllying enemies just does it for me. But I guess that's just me...
---
But I am playing a rifleman build. I guess for short range/melee builds flying enemies are a nightmare
---
Unfortunately I dont have either of those still. Sad
---
Explosives should do the trick. 
---
Melee is completely useless in the long run because of the Scorch beasts a simple would be better loot and make them land more often.
---
Great idea. I can't wait for the camera! Hopefully it's select-able through the d-pad. I hate having to trudge through menu's to get to it.
---
Don‚Äôt know if a kind soul can use Bloody Mess and break the corpse. If you‚Äôre lucky, a piece might roll off. 
---
I swear man I'm just hanging around my whitespirings camp and I just hear SHWOOSH. SHWOOSH. SHWOOSH and now it's it's just an instinct to server hop
---
dude, YOU are a scammer
---
And I‚Äôll bet you shot him anyway, I would too but I honestly feel bad that I‚Äôm shooting a fleeing combatant. Yeah he might have that 3 star mole gauntlet fisted so far up his bum that you‚Äôre pulling out his lunch but still, I‚Äôd appreciate the ability to accept their surrender and loot, in exchange for their life. But then again proctology pays well.
---
Ta. I did a scan and repair and it is hundreds now. Thanks. 
---
If youre on later ill take all the fusion cells
---
Without leaving the area then I would suggest taking a dip in the pool until you get it.  I'm assuming this was one of your first scorchedbeast? If so there is nothing on it that you cant currently do without. 
---
The Dev's were quite clever with many of the "set up" gags sprinkled throughout the map. Love finding those funny little spots. 
---
\-My favorite is the creepy mannequins standing near the urinal's in the bathrooms. LOL!
---
Ain't that a kick in the head? 
---
Ight I've got discord so not a problem 
---
I must of missed it.
---
All I could find when looking up the ability to rename guns was some old Reddit post that didn't have the answer and people were saying other people would use it to try and con people out of stuff.
---
I want to rename my main gun after a pet I lost recently seeing as I don't have a whole bunch to remember them by as they were only around for such a short time.
---
Always recording and have a lot of crazy encounters but no one to share it with. Wanna start editing it but don't really think there's much traction control to FO76 content
---
In Fallout 4 they would randomly trigger critical hits outside of VATS, so having high luck and better criticals greatly increased DPS. I wonder if that still applies in 76?
---
No I've killed other scorchedbeasts before
---
Inquiring minds want to know!
---
If you're not sure what Bethesda can do other than release a road map... I'll tell you what they can do. They can get their head out of their... and stop making bad decisions and buggy patches that kill the already unstable game 1 month at the time. So if I haven't played in a while I'm not allowed to say what I think ? What if I go bats right now, reinstall the thing and 3 hours later I get a crash ? Then I will be wise enough for you to allow me to express my doubts ?
---
50 for the best weapons is why I like that level for end game stuff. Mid 40s is good tho
---
I thought you had to take the broken cores to the tinker bench to repair them, not craft new ones.  The boards you find around the room on the ground are already functional.  You just put those onto the machine.  So, you have two choices.  Spend time picking up enough boards or bring the damaged boards to the tinker bench for repairs.
---

---
Thinking of moving some stuff around. 
---
What unique plans are available from this vendor? Thanks!
---
I have nothing to trade but want to get my brother into the game. If you do end up giving it away, I‚Äôd appreciate my name being thrown in the raffle. 
---
I agree on the rewards, but honestly they're not so bad. With my executioners gatling plasma, I can shred the scorched that attack and once the thing lands, it's over. It's absolutely garbage when the sb is in the air, but up close that thing is a killer. Almost worth the price of crafting plasma cores. Almost. 
---
Its just really bad timing and I deeply apologize. I‚Äôve been traveling for the past week and will be away for another week. Play time is limited to unreliable remote play, therefore I‚Äôm spending time to create this type of guides, as you can see here ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I am sincerely sorry, if you don‚Äôt want to wait more, maybe my friend u/Ares_GOW17 could help you out. 
---
Ps4 saves every photo you take in game even if you delete it from the album in the game it is still on your ps4.
---
Go to settings, storage, capture gallery then select fallout 76 &amp; it will show every photo &amp; screenshot ever taken.
---
You can then share or copy to external USB.
---
PVE yes, there is an absolute difference. PVP, not so much it seems.
---
I have all 3 rifle cards maxed. When my teammates share one of theirs, it stacks. ... or it used to. We haven‚Äôt done that lately 
---
Bloodied meathook.
---
Interesting, so it appears there‚Äôs far fewer PvP servers than PVE servers? I‚Äôve been playing since the game launch back in November, have only landed on the previous server a handful times when I hopped servers. 
---
You could always take a screen shot while in photo mode.
---
You might be able to work you way up by the service entrance to the bunker. Now 100% because its be a while since I've gone without marsupial 
---
I suppose I was but I wasn't playing survival, either.
---
Yeah I know hilarious funny how the people who want to prey on people who don‚Äôt want to pvp hate it so much. Can‚Äôt wait for the changes. I can see the two modes moving further apart which would great for us pve players.
---
Fireproof reduces fire and explosive. I think it's explosive, but either way the damage becomes near negligible.
---
The best way to check is to remove all of your armor from your chassis, and from your character. then check your resist numbers unarmored, and then unarmored in a chassis. i checked and both energy and ballistic went up by 60 in my chassis
---
They need to eventually cover the major holidays along with some type of monthly.  
---
Thanks. It make sense.
---
Definitely go for suppressor. Getting a sneaky shot in to pull down the enemy's health quickly certainly a worthwhile thing.
---
Interesting thank you I‚Äôll try it 
---
Rule #1 of the wasteland: Trust no one 
---
Were your numbers down before ?
---
Plan.
---
Cheesy meta build doing more than 3k damage a pop. Rocking bloodied meathook/bloodied supersledge, though the meathook actually does more damage. That +sneak crit makes for a scorchbeast that I imagine would die even if you doubled its health..
---
They get to kill you... because you don't have any aid items.
---
Just trying to give a solution you can use straight away. As more sliders hopefully come later.
---
That is roughly 10% difference between two sets, in reality should account to 2-3% more or less damage received. There are are situations where it may matter, and situations it may not. 
---
Enforcer brings em down real quick. And im purely melee 
---
Yup. Wanted to do a challenge build and ended up liking it.
---
What‚Äôs up?
---
Agreed.
---
They are a pain in the ads and for nothing.
---
Yes, sorry if I didn‚Äôt explain well.
---
Well, i wasn't hiding anywhere and i'm sure i landed more than a few shots, at least two of them using critical.
---
I did NOT shoot him. 
---
I filleted him with a Blade of Bastet. 
---
It says [removed] under your post heading üëÄ
---
This would be a great addition! An excellent way for players to create even more content for the game. 
---
I know there but my best friend enjoyed fallout and never got the chance to see fo76 so I play for both of us
---
Eh, I guess because it's April Fools?
---
I was talking about because i've others say they sometimes get no loot from her.
---
I might have missed it by now anyways but I checked and it was still 500, no biggie either way lol
---
I would go ever further and say death claws were easy to kill in fallout 4 as well. 1 low level combat rifle, a couple riflemen perks, and some jet would easily slay deathclaws even on survival.
---
Didn't take a picture because it was already dead
---
This happened to me while inside the silo, my gatlin and 50cal just shot the ceiling, had to use vats to hit anything. 
---
You just have to lob them like you're firing a mortar. If you try to use it like a missile launcher you're going to have a bad time.
---
Maybe to run away from a dangerous spot fearing of losing caps
---
This. She's tucked away in a corner and so many people aren't even aware of her existence. If you know where the bartender bot is, you simply go the left "doorway" of him and she's either in the first or second room on the left.
---
The same ones that you can get from the Random Charleston vendor.  Some things that aren't sold by the other static vendors, like the nuka clock.  Also the hunters long coat.  
---
Guess it's what they call RNG...
---
Flatwoods monster is an alien. You'll get both once you kill him
---
They can still be crouching and be in a [detected], [caution] or [danger] state. The map will only take them off if they're [hidden]. Which with how buggy stealth has been lately shouldn't be surprising that sometimes they _should_ be hidden, but aren't. But that's not the map's fault.
---
Not a single instagating or furious or even a bloodied version on my main. But, instead of any if these, I scored a quad lever action. So, I snipe, suppressor &amp; medium scope. 20 shots before I have to reload. Slow, quiet fun from rooftops and hillsides. Might not be your version of fun, but I enjoy myself.
---
I'll take a static 25% damage bonus on every shot over MAYBE a benefit on one shot. Two shot in VATS is problematic, but he didn't say anything about VATS.
---
As far as furious is concerned, the LA doesn't shoot or reload nearly as slow as you are letting on. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if you have it
---
The Neg of it is either wearing weightless or being naked, no other downside
---
Really? Thats disapointing and quite confusing as theres 2 seperate challenges. Thanks for lettong me know!
---
The reload thing is very annoying, I rush into battles a few times with empty guns and end up running away from the mob I thought I was about to mow down lol 
---
I'm mostly invisible to them so I pop off a shot, wait for them to land, then shoot them in the head from a for away about five times to kill them.
---
That being said, I only do it if they're annoying me. Otherwise I just avoid because they're not worth it.
---
Maybe they should drop 3-5 random color fluxes. That'd be great.
---
Take no prisoners
---
After TSE got nerfed they pretty much made scorchbeaste harder to kill 
---
*somewhere in the distance a kiss to build a dream on finishes playing...*
---
Really? Hmmm I see. And I‚Äôm guessing you can only use it like a melee weapon when the queen lands right?
---
Yes. It's better now. Reading the original post i had the impression it was saying the scraping armor could prevent been killed somehow, but now i inderstand that it was an hurry to do it before anything happen, before anyone find you...
---
After the TSE Nerf they pretty much made scorchbeasts harder too kill Enforcer 3 just softens the fight
---
Lol I never thought about the round shape and now it bothers me. Thanks.
---
We cant build anything round. So why a round build area. 
---
Great, this is wants going to keep me up at night now. 
---
I found it in the frat house from nuka shine quest
---
Yup. That's what the cave camp is for. That and fireproof +dense all but negates the damage so I walk right out of there without even sprinting and kill her on the way out if she chooses to land before she hits her leash range.
---
aCampos_24
---
Can you build a camp over one of those?  Asking for a friend.
---
Aaaah yes maybe that‚Äôs where I got mine from, thanks!
---
Before the Heavy Weapons buff, it was pretty awful. The first video I linked above is the end of the first pass through that nuke zone. That weapon broke shortly after. Now with the durability improvement, I'd say the gun probably does last 4x longer. Prepatch, I ran around with 8 miniguns. Now, when I find myself back at base, I probably only need to repair 2-3 of them. 
---
It's a lot more repair than a super sledge, but I find it manageable. I just don't ever sell my aluminum like I did when I was pure melee. Without a doubt, you would be signing up for a lot of upkeep and carrying multiple weapons around, but I think the results of that investment are obvious.
---
they are a manageable foe  for where they stand. they're fast and hit hard. however if I see one I can hit usually one hit critical them. maybe they should be tougher but I'd rather see more travel together than powering then up. better for loot and exp
---
I just don‚Äôt think it should be so focused on players being enemies and coming up as red as soon as you see them 
---
The whole map is a cluster as far as where places are in relation to each other vs. irl but what can you do.  But agreed to could have just as easily made it into FO3.
---
Now you‚Äôve really gotten me interested in the fireproof perk. Didn‚Äôt really think much of it at first. 
---
I dont think you can build within about 50-100 metres of the silos unfortunately
---
And make your camp a fast travel target for other players.
---
I started preparing for my ammunition and meds vending machines. I have boatloads of purified water, and a lead extractor at my camp so I can make tons of ammo. I‚Äôm excited 
---
They are supposed to be a pain in the ass, not a source of loot.
---
Good idea!
---
Then I will build 4 simple shacks, each taking up a corner.  Then when I move camp I‚Äôll have 4 options for what to quickly prop up in the new location.
---
Well looking back at it, i wish i had use another stance. Something that would have shown sadness. But, i don't have any.
---
Could just be sheer incompetence lol.
---
I don't think it crits. Sometimes the damage does seem to spike, but I attribute it to server lag since you're getting so many hits in in a short time.
---
Yep, it increases your dps and your degradation, so a double edged sword. 
---
found the Spring-Heeled Jack
---
Thanks for all the advise everyone. I wasnt able to get the loot but killed a glowing deathclaw at least
---
Does Gunsmith seem to impact degradation?
---
Legendary mods dont count as we dont have access to craft those mods. I'm hoping that will eventually change but it's not looking good. From what I have read will will be able to basically slot machine for different mods. Honestly, that's lame. Would have been better to be able to buy legendary mods. Ever for high prices. Having to gamble will likely end up not working in our favor so I'm hoping to at least get better prices and be able to buy something better
---
Ps4? If so I have an extra
---
They really do!
---
Trust but verify. 
---
I volunteer to run the Nuka Cola Plant Workshop. I already have my camp based there!
---
There is a lead and acid deposit on the south end of the map i really want to build on but its right next to a fissure site.
---
I tried to build there but even with 10 missile turrets the cost of constant repairs because of the Scorchbeast that spawns(about every hour) out weighed the benefits of building there.
---
Yes, it does. Also, Weapon Artisan to get it up to 200%. I also slot Luck of the Draw for occasional free repairs, but it triggers infrequently and won't repair your weapon if you're already over 100%. This may be because I don't keep Weapon Artisan slotted, but the infrequent procs make it hard to test.
---
I had an amazing one that aggro'd like 30 super mutants. Me and a squad of 3 felt like we saved the world.
---
Enemies with Crowns aren't Legendary enemies.
---
They're Boss enemies.
---
Neither did I, until I saw a youtube video testing orbitsl strikes against a guy with rank 3 and dense. They mentioned it works for SBs and boy, they weren't lying.
---
Yes you become more translucent. 
---
The stations should be no-kill zones or something, idk.
---
This was a huge problem.  You can tell who is just repeating bullshit they heard about the game and those how have actually played it.  Also people dont seem to know that you can take a break from a game.  You dont need to play it non-stop 24/7.  They say they have done everything there is to do and are bored and that they didnt release enough stuff to do.  You can take a break.  I did.  From January-March I did not log in.  I came back and I am having a ton of fun playing the game.  People cried about ESO being an online MMO and cried it was not single player and wanted Elder Scrolls 6, that is was killing single player games blah blah blah.  You will see this everytime any company does something like this.
---
So this ends tomorrow or today ?
---
Ooh, I think I need to speed lvl now.
---
No legendary effects of any kind, weapon or armor, when PVP, that‚Äôs a must. You can use if but the magic won‚Äôt have any effects when fighting players. 
---
The reward has to come from the system, not relying on players killing then robbing players. That will largely remove the toxicity of the current game. Make it a sport not a virtual murder fest. 
---
But why do people have to start and lock themselves into pvp? No game should make such silly rules. People should be able to choose the mode they play at any time. 
---
So much this !
---
I hate when i invite someone to team instead of fast travelling.
---
I'd love a mod that would make the crossbow fire like Chu-ko-nus in Age of Empires 2- Basically some king of 3-arrow burst fire. Usefull? I don't know. Cool as hell? You betcha!
---
In a few hours it ends i believe
---
Level 5 wiffle bats.
---
Interesting. Fair enough. So even with 200% condition and Gunsmith they are dwindling pretty rapidly? Bummer. That thing is disgusting, though! Makes me want to play around with perks and see what works. 
---
To your knowledge, do any of the following perks interact with the shredder:
---
Heavy Gunner, Incisor, Bullet Shield, Suppressor, Tenderizer (I assume so since it is in your build,) or Stabilized?
---
I had one but I scraped it by accident 
---
I dont fucking doubt it for a minute lol.  The same youtubers made so many video's on why FO76 was a shit game.  Day after day after day.  It got old but I understand why they were doing it.
---
I laughed to hard at this 
---
I would say non PA because you can utilize legendary armor to boost melee damage more then just using PA
---
Feel free to add TheBiPolarBear25 
---
Unyielding if you want to run a bloodied build. I use PA because I switch between melee and heavy weapons and PA complements the guns. But strictly melee you can get some nice boost out of regular armor 
---
When I had my camp in the Ash Heap, Murgle was a once a day visit after clearing Welch.  Miss that little guy.
---
PC, but thank you anyway.
---
Cant wait for some DLC.  I really hope they deliver and give is some sick vaults and underground "dungeons" to take on with friends.
---
You mean like it's doom?
---
Only 2000 Atoms!
---
Jumping absolutely should cancel sentinel. What kind of sentinel hop like a stupid rabbit and rule a shooter game. Whoever came up with this garbage needs to be fired. 
---
Yes, but can only be renamed "Loose Springs" or "Power Armor Chassis."
---
 I'm guessing halo was before your time...
---
With unyielding with low health my strength is at 33 so the bloodied super sledge hits for like 1000-2000 damage FYI 
---
Even longer.  Try Quake and Quake II.
---
Also One Gun Army!
---
Yeah I've been doing a lot of claiming places/ defending to hope to get them. 
---
Jesus buddy. Calm down. The game is rated M for *18+*. 
---
Do you really think a majority of players have families to take care of?  
---
Beyond that, why are you so angry you can‚Äôt complete a challenge to get this weapon? Why do you need it? 
---
You sound like the people complaining about the rare fasnacht masks. Not every player is supposed to get this stuff. 
---
I was trying to be nice, but honestly you sound like an entitled, angry prick. 
---
If you get this mad about not getting a weekly challenge in a game I can only imagine what a wonderful example you must set for your children when it comes to losing your temper. 
---
People already complaining about losing aid and junk, imagine weapons and armor. Think it would add a huge risk to survival and I like it but too many people would complain.
---
Do we know when CAMPs will be immune to slap damage in adventure mode? 
---
 just gotta say..... No one would ever put a couch next to a pool table. 
---
Oh I know, I was just saying Halo was the first game I played competitively enough to jump around in. 
---
How do you not die quickly though? I seem to die fast with a low health melee build 
---
I do not, I'd assume once they start finalizing survival seasons and make adventure mode more of a safe place to play. 
---
I have a bloodied 2h build and I use Unyielding armor. To add defense I maxed barbarian in strength, max ironclad in endurance, maxed lone wanderer in charisma, max nerd rage in intelligence, and max serendipity in luck. 
---
I appreciate it. In FO4 it wasn't just brightness, but also the behavior of light, shadows, and headlamp projection.that needed modding, but I hope this will help.
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt remove anything myself, I put news under the post, is that what changed? I‚Äôm genuinely confused rn haha
---
Sorry mate! As you can tell, I'm OCD as shit when it comes to design, so it immediately irked me. Last night, I was building, what literally is a compound, and I couldn't one thing that I wanted to in a perfect space, because...... circle.
---
Imagine what I was like in FO4, with some of those damn awkward shapes... **screams internally**
---
They only spawn occasionally in the asylum. I probably ran through it a dozen times looking for nurse outfits before finding a tinfoil hat.
---
I would say sooner than later. Vault raids are going to be high level so if you want to keep up with the rest of us on the vault raids you have some catching up to do. Plus once you adjust to the changes you will come to realize 76 is the best of the 3d fallouts. The story is lackluster but I have put more hours into 76 than 3, NV and 4 combined. 
---
I'll move it if I can ever set it up for a game. Until then it's my stage for bass playing. 
---
Oh damn! That's cool!
---
Just south of the Investigator's Cabin? That's where my camp is placed and it looks similar. 
---
Theres a 50 cal sniper? 
---
With concentrated fire, any gun that isnt a shotgun will make short work if the wings and force them to land.
---
My camp is in a really useful spot atm that‚Äôs very defensible, not trying to move it 
---
This happens to me so often I just assume anyone who invites me and hasn't talked to me is doing it by mistake.
---
Lol no just didn't have internet back then! I think I've seen people on warframe jump shoot... Not the same though.
---
How do you glitch the wires through the ground?
---
You mean you don't love a team of everybody in X0-1 PA using handmade rifles?
---
Legendary armor is RNG dependent though.    I don't understand how you can plan a build around  gear you don't have and have no guarantee of getting.
---
Best of luck! I was surprised/very happy to find it, I‚Äôve been looking forever 
---
The red dot is pretty awesome in certain situations. Like someone fights some ghouls you can sneak up with the ghouls, they ignore and kill the dude from behind :D
---
That‚Äôs kind of what I told him. It‚Äôs just electronically rendered junk. I think my new friend is more of a hoarder and can‚Äôt get his head around letting go. Wasn‚Äôt really soliciting solutions to his problem, just relating a slightly ironic situation with the fallout from duping. Thanks for your reply 
---
I'm gonna exclusively sell plans, chems, beer and ammo
---
Because it where all the cool kids are at......nah probably old f\*cks like us played  all 5 Fallouts. Although this one tests my patience like an MFer!
---
Multiple times recently I've invested the time and ammo to kill one and it falls to the ground and disappears! Super frustrating.
---
Nerd rage and serendipity in luck help
---
Diluted stimpaks are also your friend 
---
PA with emergency protocols is also a help
---
You can get the plans for a .50 Cal receiver for the .308 rifles that changes the ammo type to .50 Cal.
---
It's not as strong as the straight .308 but it's way WAY more economical to craft ammo for it, especially paired with the ammosmith and super duper perks
---
Well you can A: buy of other players or B: farm for it. All I'm saying is that you loss the option to use legendary armor completely if you use PA. You have more flexibility in non PA builds 
---
I‚Äôd be in awe of Bethesda if they did this.
---
Be a higher level and have a two shot explosive
---
Killed the scorchbeast queen for the first time and then again about 25 minutes later today with a random group and I never got a single drop. So dissapointing.
---
Saying Beta is just a sneaky way for developers to stay ‚Äòoff the hook‚Äô and not have to take responsibility for mistakes. This is, however, just my opinion you don‚Äôt have to agree. 
---
No, No, Haven't tested, Yes, Yes, Assume Yes (but stuff tends to die too quickly for limb damage to matter and I don't slot awareness to be able to tell if a limb is crippled)
---
Other perks I know work are Basher (since the shredder is a bash attack; this is also why degradation is so high) and Blood Mess.
---
My rule of thumb now is that if the perk or condition says melee, it probably doesn't work, and if it says attack, weapon or heavy weapon it probably does. I think I might have still been testing some perks in that video. This is what I use currently.

---
I am considering dropping Twisted Muscles and Luck of the Draw. I don't shoot often, but sometimes you need to cripple a scorchbeast with a shotgun to get it to land. Dropping Luck of the Draw could give me a couple more points of Adrenaline.
---
I havent made any alts, but I was under the impression weekly and daily challenges were attached to your character not your account. so you could do the 5 weekly/daily challenges on your main and your alts.
---
They're always up at the nukacrypt website. 
---
Depends on how dedicated you want to get with it. A bloodied melee build with unyielding armor and adrenal reaction is very good, but you're also pretty much a one-two hit kill. 
---
I was not overencumbered at all.. it was just a glitch. I understand glitches happen I‚Äôve been a loyal fan since day one but it just seemed like an awful joke under the current state of affairs in Survival at Whitesprings specifically 
---

So how about instead of balancing them as enemies, we just make them sentient and playable( and balanced).   
---
Sentient Deathclaws are cannon. the enclave just killed them, but 76  takes place before that.   
---
So lets get some Deathclaw npcs, and make them hug-able.
---
It's sure cool to look at and I'm happy for them. But like... Why have choices at all then?
---
At level 70 right now and with my stealthrifle build I can 1shot a deathclaw with a sneak attack with a black powder rifle. Even some of the higher level ones I can 1 shot with a vats critical or I cripple their limb making them harmless
---
dont worry about it mate, the drops for these challenges are average at best.
---
You're better off farming Adventure mode and get a 2 or 3\* legendary weapons that are way better than the curated rolls they giving us.
---
an instigating M79 launcher isnt very good.
---
Move the camp box around until it spawns you in the rocks on the actual terrain, then place a conduit on the terrain and move it around until it will let you connect it to the nuclear generator (mine was on the second floor with the connector cone right next to the rock roof to make this easier) then just place connectors on the terrain going up the hill and play around with it until it will let you place one in a spot where it can connect through (I think camera angle is important here because it was a huge pain to get it to actually connect up top).
---
I‚Äôm dying to know what songs you hate, personally I like all of them.
---
In the trailer to the south of Berkeley springs workshop
---
They are actively promoting this kind of player, that's the \_entire point\_ of survival mode, they WANT more of the toxic grifer asshats from RUST and ARK. 
---
I just bought this a couple of weeks ago, and I've been loving it so far. I've literally had nothing but positive experiences with the folks I've run into online. So worth it. 
---
I rather be tanky, making it look like bullets only tickle me as I cack some skulls in yknow?
---
Granted bloodied builds are awesome, I don't want to be insta killed if I get surrounded or something hits me without me realizing it's there 
---
I read that as constant fwapping and was writing , ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry bro, we don‚Äôt kink-shame.‚Äù When I reread ur comment.   
---
Is that a FAL? 
---
Glue, duct tape, typewriters, phones, and all guns should be scrapped constantly. These items scrapped are a necessity for my Heavy Gun PA build. 
---
How dumb do you have to be to think I‚Äôve killed that many Legendaries and none of them are starred? Whatever you‚Äôre obviously a Bethesda shill
---
You know, my apologies. I hadn't even considered the fact that it was reflecting my Perk... That also explains why I thought things changed recently, because I'm on my alt character.
---
On my main character, I have Pack Rat rank 3, which is exactly where I noticed what you've illustrated. Light weights, but bulks making no sense on a number of them.
---
However, my alt only has Pack Rat rank **2** and... well as you can see above, the bulk sticks with logic.
---
Oh gosh, I kind of figure you where busy, that's why I stop, I didn't want to be a pain in the butt, but I will wait, so no problem. And I apologize if you felt obligated.
---
They really are worthless fights that drop nothing and waste resources. More often than not they end up gang banging you. I often end up being forced to fight 3 at once. It's not difficult or fun just tedious and boring and expensive. 
---
2 different fat men
---
Two different fat men
---
You'll love r/fo76bearhunt then!
---
I agree completely. I tried a power armor rifles build and found it to be the most boring thing ever. There are so many fun builds that it seems like a waste to take your dusty old PA rifles build to level 300 or whatever.
---
Thats what i did i dashboarded myself to get out of survival mode
---
This is every fallout game to be honest, Death claws are severely overrated in terms of strength and are literally only a problem if you‚Äôre either not experienced or being an idiot/not being prepared. Of course at a low level they are always scary but once you get to around 35+ they stop being an issue and more of easy loot. Even in new Vegas they never felt like a threat, they are there to distract you from stronger enemies in my opinion and 76 adds a bunch more of those 
---
I think the answer is pretty transparent. 
---
Happens often, I will have the target dead in my sights and I shoot, no indicator shows up, try again and again. My mate who I normally play with comments that the shots are going wide or up in the air or straight into the ground. 
---
When do camps become immune to damage? One of the things I've enjoyed in this game was to handle people who come up and randomly hit/shoot you by ignoring them, vomiting on them, and un-assing the area... and then stalking them and try to figure out where their camp was. And then destroy their camp completely.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many things I‚Äôve scrapped and not received any mods
---
I‚Äôm running a power armor/2h melee build, I can kill lvl 80 scorchbeasts in a few hits. I just wish they would land more often, cause when they‚Äôre in the air I‚Äôm completely useless especially in the SBQ fight
---
The two I hate are "I didn't know the gun was loaded" and "Ol' Man Mose".  They just really get on my nerves.  I would love to just turn them off.
---
Doesnt exist only for the Tommy gun it does
---
Tons of plans and legendarys are waiting to be sold!
---
Love it but how do you store caps?
---
Sounds like the life for me.
---
Ya the weight problem is a legendary issue with how and when it calculates 90%...  
---
That and how they add weight to a weapon / armor is a multiply + add float calculation vs just adding a set weight
---
There is a suppressor. I finally got it after scraping I don't know how many 10mm's.
---
nice! Also I am so jealous of your paper lantern thingies from fasnacht. Thats the only blueprint i think i didnt get :( 
---
Okay, to solve this, have a brand new second character you only play for the level up challenges.
---
I started a new lady to see what a melee build is like, didn't remember how quickly you level as a noob.
---
That's awesome :)
---
How many meters is a standard floor?
---
Honestly it seems like more a heavy weapon, but that's just my opinion (and then it would benefit from "Bear Arms").  
---
But who knows what Bethesda will do!
---
Another character
---
You won't if you have the good gear, i have about 500dr + dodge + nerd rage and lone wanderer + serependity. The only thing that kill me are those fluo ghouls because of all the rads. 
---
I didn't think there was one
---
Oh ok. I thought I was missing something. Gotcha now. Thanks
---
and let us build camps next to camps. Let us take over and repair the abandoned houses in the wasteland...so much potential and it's "here's a tiny budget and a round area, by the way, don't bother trying anything fun  or inventive, we'll nerf that out of the game soon". 
---
Did you ever bang Betty?
---
He probably horded all that. Once I get over encumbered and want/try to drop something or want to consume anything it tells me it's gonna destroy it..
---
Remedy.. Sell heavy stuff immediately. 
---
Usually crappy weapons and then once in can, I dump steel and wood. Since those two resources are plentiful.  
---
On Xbox there isn't anyway to tell what mode they are in when joining off a GT or through a game invite unless they are on our friends list
---
Any market for bobbleheads?
---
I have a two shot explosive level 45 and an instigating level 35 and the instigating has better damage even if I max the Demolition perks. You can't beat one-shotting everything with that sneak first shot. I would prefer an instigating explosive, but you get what you get. I guess if I didn't sneak anti-armor might be the way to go, unless I ran bloodied. But, I don't run a bloodied build (then I'd want a bloodied explosive). It all depends on your build and playstyle. Your VATS crits build sounds similar to mine. You'd just need one shot if you had an instigating. 
---
I'll run with you sometime- Meidara
---
They're the biggest nuisance now.
---
They don't drop anything worth while. They freaking attack RELENTLESSLY
---
Does anybody know how long things last after being placed in an Overseer's cache and/or being dropped in paper bags? I often drop .38, pipe guns, and bobby pins outside Value 76, but have no clue if anybody ever uses them.
---
Yeah me to im just going to only trade with friends and vendors now
---
OMG they look exactly like the aliens in that movie
---
[Bugs!](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Starship_Troopers_miniature.JPG/1200px-Starship_Troopers_miniature.JPG)

Very true!
---
Just store em in your stash so you dont lose em if you feel alone and need some real human voices in your head :D
---
They did the same thing in Starship Troopers: both the Enclave and Earth military have some serious fascist overtones so they made their uniforms reflect that.
---
What armor ya need ?
---
I swear it only happens to legendaries for me...
---
If there's a group of them all the regular enemies will still be there at the end, and the blood of where I killed the legendary will be there, but the body sometimes vanishes. 
---
It‚Äôs very strange indeed. I have several of them weigh a lot without any modification. Just like night picked up a ‚Äòweightless‚Äô combat armor that weighs 8 lbs, I imagine its former owner is a behemoth? Most of those supposedly 90% weight reduced items are probably 90% of their standard weight instead. 
---
dont forget our indoor planters to boot, as others stated they could borderline make a dlc around farming, they could springboard off project beanstalk even.
---
There's a bohemoth that hangs out at Solomon's pond east of Whitesprings.
---
It's just up the hill from my camp. I tried talking to him one time but he ran at me so I fired on him.
---
He looked like a Steve though. 
---
Wish we could have been friends. 
---
Definitely this,  Radscorps are way tougher plus they burrow warp every other hit and can poison. 
---
Yeah it makes sense as well, the game can‚Äôt know whether or not another player knows you are there or not, so it makes sense that sneak attacks are removed 
---
Sorry it took so long. [Link](https://youtu.be/f1QLgDwYkeg)
---
&gt;I'll take a static 25% damage bonus on every shot over MAYBE a benefit on one shot.
---
Instigating is not a "maybe" it's a 100% damage boost for the first shot. You can one shot anything with that amount of damage making any further shots pointless. 150*2 = 300. 146+0.25*150 = 188. That's the real difference between a Two shot and an instigating weapon. Instigating wins. Btw, the accuracy debuff from two shot is active all the time, not just with vats. Just switch between a two shot and a regular rifle and look at the reticle.
---
&gt;As far as furious is concerned, the LA doesn't shoot or reload nearly as slow as you are letting on. 
---
One of my most used weapons is a Quad LA.... It's: 
---
1. not fast enough to benefit from furious.
---
2. It can also one shot most mobs. Making furious pointless.
---
The one and only case in which furious could be useful is during the SBQ fight. That is if you don't miss or switch targets. 
---
Then you have the standard 5 bullets/clip. The furious caps at 6 or so hits, there's also a timer and if you don't shoot and hit the target during that time the damage gets reset. But wait, you have to reload and hope the SBQ is still around for you to benefit from furious.
---
Furious is so good with fast firing weapons because they can get to that max damage really quickly. On a LA you need a full clip, then reload and fire again.
---
Anti-armor is way more useful for long fights than furious, heck even two shot is better than furious for rifles. 
---
Also some more misinformation from your initial post:
---
Tormentor is literally pointless for rifle users. You kill stuff in 1 shot, no need to bother with limb shots. Tormentor is way more useful for fast firing weapons. A rifleman just needs to aim for the head. 
---
&gt;doesn't hog too much AP in VATS if you mod it down away from a scope and long barrel.
---
Vats needs scope even if you will never use it. It gives accuracy. You need accuracy in vats.
---
Same with range. You need that shit too with vats. This is why in vats a shotgun will have crappy % when a rifle is at 95%. Because the rifle has more range. 
---
Besides that, if you use a good vats build the amount of AP used per shot is meaningless. You can regen it all extremely quickly. 
---
Personally I use an Executioners with limb and faster vats crit fill, but you will almost never land an instigating hit on another player. 
---
I'm going to need to figure out how to get them from PS4 to imgur, I've been taking a ton of spooky ones
---
I'm trying to get all the mods for the Radium Rifle right now. I understand your pain 
---
Thats great mate we need to stay safe when selling and buying 
---
little expensive for me but thanks for the offer!
---
Again sorry nothing to trade. But is be in for a giveaway if you do go that route.
---
While I know it had its issues I don't mind a fallout to chill to.
---
It's like No man's sky all over again. Just a drink, quiet 'me' time and explore.
---
they are on survival mode instead of adventure 
---
That happened to me when I was joining a friend's world. I was in the bunker. And spawned in the nuke zone near the WS service entrance. I survived long enough to run in and access the bunker. I think it must have been daytime and my sunkissed perk card. But I had about 75% rads. I was really surprised I survived.
---
Well, i often get invited in the middle of nowhere, at my camp, so i know they want a free fast travel.
---
But other times i'm doing some event alone i get an invite i know they want to do the event too.
---
But since my language is not english, i refuse all invites.
---
I would love if they had empty spots in the towns that you could build in. Also would love rectangle shape for the border !  They need to let people build right next to each other to form larger communities.
---
Once I had a holotape I found randomly, no clue where/when I found it.  Turns out I needed it to get in a computer.  I‚Äôm assuming that a quest should have been activated at some point, but nothing.  Maybe it was a bug, maybe just a small treat because I was a good explorer....but yea at least keep them at your camp
---
Considering the game crashed on me 5 times last night (3 times consecutively, right after taking a workshop, building it up TWICE... I was out of iron by the end so just I gave up on it), I suspect the weird building restrictions are there to try and alleviate some of the stress on the servers.
---
Yeah the ironsight sucks
---
I wouldn't mind if they just showed all possible mods and greyed out the ones you don't have. In the area where they show the perk card you need for the mod they could put a message like, "Not yet learned".
---
If I could just get more plants and place them next to each other in a reasonable manner, I'd buy every atom in the known universe.
---
Always try to aim for the thruster on Gutsy's, or any Mr. Handy type robot. You'll do extra damage to them, and cause them to stagger.
---
I want to snap upper floors to walls without freaking stairs just like I could in fallout 4. Not being able to in 76 is beyond stupid imho.
---
Logging off now. Add my GT and if you catch me on in the future you can have them. 
---
What kind of base are you looking to make?
---
I build usually in electrical towers, the one south of horizon is my current base because it is near where beginners are and it seems like a fitting place for a bar named wavelength.
---
That certainly seems to be the case. I'm not a huge server hopper (anything to avoid a load screen) but I've never hopped back to the same server in adventure mode, and I've played since BETA. In Survival though, it seems to happen a lot, at least outside peak hours. But even on Saturday morning, which I imagine is a pretty busy time, it only seemed like there were about 4 servers active to hop between.
---
I once dropped my main weapon in a bush while jumping and trying to press R for radaway (was in weapons/inventory) spent the next 20 mins searching for it as i tried to fend off super mutants with my bare fists. almost gave up but then i found it in bush.
---
Oooohhh.... So that cat is always there! A few days ago i was on the overseer quest and went from Welsh to the next mission marker using that path north from the Station, and i was amazed by a camp someone had made there, but even more amazed by the cat. I was so jealous of that player think he or she had tamed it.
---
Is it April Fool or there is one for real? I can miss like all weapons but i don't have suppressor for 10mm SMG
---
You said it yourself, it's a game. If I wanted to experience putting forth effort and being annoyed with minimum to no rewards, I'd work multiple customer service jobs.
---
Sure I LOVE running through the world of fallout and don't need to be rewarded with drops or loot everytime I kill something, but the big baddie of the whole game? Yeah, it needs to be worth it.
---
100% as long as your target is at full health. So that means the mob you are fighting has one chance to deliver you your bonus before you are back to base weapon damage. In PVP that is closer to a 0% chance. 
---
I've met great people to play with through reddit. Basically built a regular squad. 
---
I think your being sarcastic, I do wish I had a nice two shot explosive. But I stayed away from buying or trading for one when duping was the big thing, so I don't have one.
---
I found it in a porta Pottie near Abbie‚Äôs bunker
---
I was going to do the same but there's a 25000 cap limit. I had no idea until I hit it this morning.
---
Guess I'll blow a few thousand and just get trashed in the game tonight.
---
I'll have to check what I have and I'll get back with you
---
My PSN is Raza1849 im level 75 or 76 but im not at my ps4 right now
---
Definitely a keeper if you play a vats+sneak+sniper build. I‚Äôm level 129 and my level 35 instigating lever is by far my go to weapon. The only time I usually switch up is down in the silos or SBQ.
---
Or tesla rifle. Dear god.
---
But isn't everything you get in seasonal mode temporary by nature anyway? My understanding of seasons is that you have to start with new characters, and the season only lasts for a limited amount of time. When the season ends then everything is gone anyway. Sure I'd be pissed if I permanently lost gear for main  character, but for a temporary character I wouldn't care as much. 
---
And i found myself at over 900 plastic on my main mostly from others sources. Waiting for player vending, lol.
---
I want a gad'dam veehickall!
---
If it's on the ground it's like 20 rounds of 5mm with a proper Gatling gun build. 
---
They definitely are better than they were at launch I'll give them that. I think they still need to be looked at for improvement though.
---
That‚Äôs amazing. I wonder if it‚Äôs tied to IP addresses, i.e. you‚Äôre always assigned to one of the nearest servers, if there are only a few servers in certain area, you end up going back and forth between only a few options. It would be interesting if someone on PC can use VPN to do some experiments. 
---
We should start of faction of Charleston camp raiders.  Ill blow any camp there to smithereens.

Yes on the ground haha
---
Yea i know i just wanted it because its named haha
---
The camps also look horrid too. Charleston is such a bad place to build.
---
The problem is running into them in an area they can't seem to find a place to land.
---
I am level 163, and with my 3\* instigating hardened lever action, it would take somewhere between 50 and 100 rounds to even think about killing a SB. With melee, it only takes me 5 or 6 hits with my 3\* Multi-purpose axe. I tried to make my build equal parts rifle/melee, but it was just something I threw together, ha ha. They definitely need to give us a way to force them to land. I've heard that you can cripple their wings, but I don't think I've ever done it. I think that alone would make it a better fight. a few shots to either wing should knock them out of the sky, and if they want to keep it kinda hard, they could make it take a few knockdowns before they are crippled and can't take back off. I am at the point that I can out sprint them now, though, I didn't think that would be possible when I was lower level.  I think adding maybe one random pure flux to their drop would also make the fight worthwhile, probably even make SBs farm-worthy.
---
I believe this is a feature when using a controller 
---
Don't avoid players. Half the time they will give you free stuff for the first 20 levels.
---
This some Handmaid‚Äôs Tale esq shit.
---
I had the exact thing happen today, in the change room by the showers. I thought it went into a secret room or something, because there is a space there that does not line up with the size of the hallway and the next room.
---
I agree they are much better than they were at launch, but I think there still is room for improvement. It needs to feel like a game, fun and rewarding.
---
Right now they are just a nuisance I try to avoid. 
---
Well the legendary vender will give you tokens to get better legendarys so all are good
---
Platform?
---
On PS4 and the night is as bright as day. I don‚Äôt have night vision on any weapons because there‚Äôs absolutely no need for it. beautiful and not challenging. 
---
Lmao so stupid in the reality of things... these people emerge from vaults and find blue prints on random radiated animals lol 
---
Yeah, I got 93 lol. Never used a single one, wish we could sell them
---
Yeah I've crafted and scrapped low level weapons for the sole purpose of learning mods and it works fine. 
---
Following this for all the cool photos.  
---
so I post it it gets -1 votes, you post it it's gets 163 upvotes
---
reddits at it's peek
---
You offered nothing to the conversation. I wasnt angry about the challenge, im annoyed you have the audacity to comment about what i do with my life. 
---
And yes, there are plenty of people that play that also have families to take care of. Your input has been arrogant, ignorant, and irrelevant.
---
If it's in the air it's like... maybe 30?
---
Some person in outrage cold turkey downvoted that.  How sad.
---
No one said anything about crowned enemies.
---
You can use the tall concrete fences... sort of.. they will snap diagonally, but use up a fair amount of budget.. comme √ßi comme √ßa ü§î
---
Thanks. Yeah, I've been doing exactly that for about an hour and a half now. My Two Shot Exploding Handmade is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the next couple days!!
---
I can't find it even though I've looked through the entire place
---
in the next update they said venders no matter the faction will share a cap limit of 1400
---

---
The problem is "the right perks". I'm not hating on specific builds or game mechanics, but all builds should at least be a TINY bit viable when it comes to fighting the main big bad in FO76.
---
But from the lock picker‚Äôs perspective I stand up when I pick the lock, I always wonder whether that breaks my sneak. 
---
N-No. You couldn't jump in Doom or Doom 2.  
---
or even if we could have 2 decks of perk cards where you can press a button in the pipboy to quickly switch so for incamp or lockpicking you have one set and another for killing shit
---
I left some Nukashine.  I hope they appreciate it. 
---
I just leveled a new character and from 1-30 I put points in commando while just using a hunting rifle I had no trouble killing stuff even though I wasn‚Äôt specced into rifleman. I‚Äôd say go with wherever you want to use in the long term. 
---
yeah, that's a good comparison.
---
For pve definitely pa you have emergency protocols that gives you proper survivability even at sbq fights with less then 20% hp. Plus all the benefits from pa frame itself are great.
---
This works too
---
I've seen two different spawn versions of the Flatwoods Monster,  one with glowing purple eyes and helmet and one without.  The one without the helmet definitely looks like a green alien. 
---
I got points for completing a kill (10?) different cryptids challenge after killing one with glowing helmet just last night. I didn't see the game give me any notifications on killing aliens or the Flatwoods Monster though...I will have to check tonight to see if I got any credit for those.
---
This bug is what forced me to take a break for a month so I didn‚Äôt lose my cool. It was finally fixed for a bit, I went out of town, came back today and it happened to me three times. Each time with a different weapon type, each a different enemy type, one legendary two not... there is nothing consistent about the bug that tells me it‚Äôs any one thing and thus can be somehow avoided. I feel another break coming on. 
---
Yea different beam color and burns where it hits. 
---
This type of experience is really all you can expect from unrestricted PVP IMO. It's why Survival isn't my preferred play mode and more something that I just screw around with from time to time with an alt character. 
---
They already announced this. (CAMP becomes visible if vending machine is deployed ***and*** powered up)
---
This reddit post is unnessecary.
---
I met a level 50-odd in whitesprings with a partial set of mixed PA.  I was tempted to chuck him a full set of 200% repaired T51b, but then I thought -- fuck him.
---
Super mutant behemoth near Solomon‚Äôs pond!
---
Gutsy are worse than sentries with their bullshit shots.
---
This isn't your typical fallout game, where you get most of the enjoyment from the story, not saying the story is bad but, I've had a ton a fun making my own adventure.
---
 The main story and the side stuff you can find is a lot of fun. You're essentially discovering what happened to the world while you were in the vault for the last 20 odd years. Some of the writing and voice acting are top notch. Some of the holo stories you'll hear can be the most depressing story to listen to, some are super fun, others are quite entertaining(a radio drama about wendigos) 
---
This is about walking the world, discovering what happened, and playing the role you want.
---
Some here on this sub are Responders, helping those in need and giving back to others.
---
Some are Raiders, taking what's theirs everyone else is damned.
---
Some are Lone Wanderers, some help others, some just others, most just leave you be.
---
I am the Cannibal Moleman of West Virginia, if I see those in need ill stop by and lend a hand, if I see people attacking and ganging up on people, I stop by to try and even the odds ^even ^if ^I ^die ^trying
---
Regardless of what I do, I eat people before their friend's eyes to remember me bye.
---
There is a story to guide you, but it isn't the main story you follow.
---
You follow ** *your* ** story, writing your own adventure.
---
Fallout community is really awesome :)
---
Thats really interesting. I need to keep a look out for the helmetless one but thats a really cool find! Thanks alot!
---
Oh man great weapon but there is a shit load of mods.  Takes a lot of scrapping to learn them all haha. 
---
Its a joke for sure
---
I‚Äôm scared to drop all of mine Incase I need them but it‚Äôs getting a little out of hand lol 
---
Came back and read and I must say I totally agree. Had the same feeling as I did that story. I did a full story run fresh out of the vault, as I also participated in the BETA but seeing posts like this sparks my earliest FO76 memories. When the Enclave Bunker was ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Shit‚Äô‚Äô and everyone was rushing that particular questline. 
---
Then they nuke, kill the queen and say ¬´what now?¬ª Well the content is there if you pay attention to it and if you rush, dont complain that there is no story, you just rushed and missed it.
---
Scorchbeasts should either be legendary by default, or at least have a guaranteed rare drop of some sort by default.
---
10mm SMG has no barrel mods. 
---
Nah, I just had the weathered one. Sorry about that. 
---
Probably worth trying, for sure. But I could also see it as a demand thing. FO76 has X servers and two game modes... I'd imagine they switch the servers between the two modes based on current server demand. So if only 15 people are playing Survival worldwide on PS4 at any one time, why spool up a server you don't need?
---
Thanks for the info everyone! I‚Äôm getting ready to buy the calibrated shocks plan and while I‚Äôm sure  that getting enough of the pure violet flux to build one for each leg is going to take time in nuke zones, at least I‚Äôm not forced to buy a perk I don‚Äôt need right now.
---
(I have to admit that it‚Äôs kind of weird that the Power Smith card specifically mentions crafting advanced PA mods, yet no PA mods actually require Power Smith. Sounds like everyone buys the perk for the 1st and 3rd rank abilities.)
---
Not ussssss . You wanna live forever!?
---
Sounds like a good farm if you have a build that kills scorchbeasts easily.
---
Even a front ring sight like on the combat rifle. That open square is terrible, and the model itself HAS a front ring in it, just not the ironsight
---
Scorchbeast queen?
---
Shit happens Reddit has a mind of its own üòâ
---
They are zero weight right ?  
---
There is a write up for aliens in the survival guide but I haven't seen any yet. The fashnuc parade was in there as well before it was even mentioned in the updates. So aliens might be part of a new event in the future.
---
Appalachia radio?
---
Please tell me there are other Potterheads out there that saw this and immediately thought of Delores Umbridge. 
---
That is a very imposing picture!
---
I have a few on [r/FO76Pics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76Pics/) that I wanted to share here, is it better to create new posts or to crosspost the ones I put up there?
---
&gt; Only scary in packs
---
just like any enemies in the current meta.
---
We just either need a hardcore mode where diseases, crippled limbs, radstorms and this stuff has far more effect and happens more regularly which should make fights more dangerous.
---
At the same time we need to drastically increase the number of enemies in adventure mode. Everywhere. We need more stuff to fight.
---
Yeah, I'm finding that out real fast. And thanks!
---
Sounds good. I'm almost to the control room

Still for sale? I'm looking for raider shielded.

If we get a robot DJ, please please please let it Wallace.

That sounds good too, hmm. Never had one there
---
Wow, didn‚Äôt see that so we can go to only one vender and dump 1400 worth of junk and other stuff without all the fast travel, hope this is true üòÄ
---
Started playing Jan 9th that's a fucking oof.
---
Go ahead, I just got camped by a bunch of people with seeming lag switches. You shoot them in the head, no dmg but they can shoot you through a wall.   
---
I guess my earlier review of being hopeful has changed lol, finally uninstalled and going to play something that isn't just a cuddle factory or a gank for gank sake game. You shouldn't need to be level 200 with assassin gear just to level up in survival; if you get hit with a .44 in the face without power-armor it should hurt IMO. If that is the way fallout 76 is going or you can go into the cuddle box....well I'm noping out. 
---
For sure man
---
So the survival server is here, and Ass/Sent with pneumatic is a pain in the ass. Especially if they have a team. No word on a rebalance coming down the tube.
---
Radshields could counter the radiation damage.
---
Pneumatic counters staggers
---
Melee is risky, especially if they are rolling an aae anything (i've gotten through for a kill a couple of times buuuut... its hard)
---
Most of us don't spec for a tesla rifle
---
Have people tried a cryolator and suppressor? Give a teammate time to get to melee and punch through?
---
Any other strategies develop since the server dropped?  These guys are the biggest headache i've ran into. Cav seems manageable to deal with.
---
I like listening to them, the acting is pretty good.
---
That‚Äôs a possibility, just send pvp players to fill as few pvp servers as possible and shut down the empty ones or use them for other stuff. 
---
Me personally? I like true short barrel (think that's what its called) and a bash stock. Pump the fuckers full of lead and beat open the side of their head. 
---
This is why I refuse to get rid of my foundation built base. 
---
We have a siren that we can build and power up but aside from sounding annoying it doesnt do much.
---
In my opinion it should either attract a metric shit ton of enemies or be used for the exact purpose you described (although it would have a limited range, simply what you can hear or not hear)
---
I ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Ol Man Mose. I wish we could have all of the songs from FO4.
---
I know, I just thought it only existed in fairy tales.
---
just a pity I get "I didn't know the gun was loaded" almost on loop with country roads and one other occasionally
---
This would be awesome
---
About 3 i think
---
I already went through that and several other lists, as I said above I've sampled the tracks that I found and couldn't come up with anything.
---
It's more likely it would destroy OR it would become one of those infinite-loading-icon bags I find occasionally. They'll never show their contents for the taking.
---
Oh my main has done it, just never used the device.
---
Still need the veil on my alt but keep forgetting about the whole thing. 
---
You can't loot legendaries off of players bodies. Just junk and a percentage of aid items. Walk around with very little caps, junk, or aid in survival and there's basically no consequence.
---
Its certainly nice that they made rocks, bushes and smaller trees disappear when you build stuff on them, but honestly i would love a function where you could 
---
A) cut down large trees that are within your CAMP area
---
B) flatten the ground you want to build on.
---
This would seriously be helpful.
---
I often find people getting them confused with each other, so I assumed that was what you were on about.
---
it should be 2000
---
but I'll take what  I can 
---
I'm always so proud when people go out of their way to build real homes, and not just square box houses filled with random workbenches. It looks amazing.
---
Ranger station and bed and breakfast also have them
---
Only thing is it will not fix the problem wth server hopping 
---
Utah I think the veil may be the only piece I still use 50+ levels after doing the quest.
---
It's so useful and I hate the gas masks 
---
I absolutely agree. They're kind of laughable right now. Not even a challenge at all. 
---
Same same
---
I say to each their own.  It's just not my cup of tea.    I loved the Fallout 4 songs and most of the New Vegas songs.  I would love to have ain't it a kick in the head and big iron on the radio for Fallout 76.
---
I had hoped I could shed my chameleon chest, replace it with the mutation, and more or less gain a spot back. But I had it all wrong in my head, so if I did that I'd have to change a lot of my build etc, just seems like more effort than it's worth (especially given its not a stealth build, I just like a  chameleon piece to 'dip out' for a second if I need to). 
---
This!
---
Or an old trailer park, where players could build in lots right up next to each other. Have an amenities block which provides power, and joint quests to defend and maintain the trailer park.
---
I want to create a town of players that work together - or a military style camp.
---
And please let me build my tents with out the need for foundations
---
Nah. No-starred legendaries dont count towards the challenge, but theyre about 80% of the legendaries.that spawn.
---
Send an invite oneeyedcole
---
Excellent!
---
Same I‚Äôm bloodied melee and I can one shot it with about 50% health on my bloodied Supersledge, or invariably on my instigating.
---
Exactly, the other alternatives ruin the costume of the character in a majority of instances 
---
Cave where?
---
I never encountered one myself, so I can't speak from experience. Sorry.
---
Recoil and ammo consumption are a big negative with full auto rifles. I've kept mine semi, but I have one particular handmade that I've been saving to convert to full auto (it's explosive). Do you like to fire from distance or up close?
---
Once i was testing how far i must be from mini nuke to survive explosion i died about 5 times xd
---
If a quarter of the group is lvl 60 or less I don‚Äôt even go. I saw 3 lvl 40s using lever actions and pipe revolvers against her and I just put my gun away. I was the only heavy build there and we got her to mutate with about 5 minutes left. Failed the event obviously
---
If there‚Äôs a lot of noobs around it‚Äôs nearly impossible to complete, if you‚Äôre not lvl 80 or more, just don‚Äôt go. It‚Äôs hard to get the right gear right after lvl 50 and you add to her health pool so the rest of us have to pull double the weight. Just saying
---
I can kill them in 5 shots from my non legendary pipe revolver, in 3/NV they we're horrifying. Now I just walk straight at them firing into their faces.
---
Yeah, because it seems kind of silly to move the faction vendors to white springs so we don't have to fast travel all over the map for them and then set up player vending without a hub so we have to fast travel all over the map for them.
---
THANK YOU!! Those are my exact sentiments, also you're welcome for the breaking of the text wall. I tend to type in run on sentences sometimes and don't catch myself.
---
Really? What build are you running?
---
I‚Äôm running bloodied melee and I keep around 19% health for nerd rage.
---
They don‚Äôt one shot me at all.
---

---
Not entirely sure..
---
What kinds are there??
---
I need to start farming crops for adhesive
---
The ones that are quest items are marked w a diamond. The others are mostly useless once you've heard them.
---
Stealth sniper build. My HP is really low lol
---
There should be a way to gift atomic shop items to people. Bethesda still gets paid, and there's a chance you might spend more to give matching things to your friends.
---
And they say guns are what's wrong with our society.
---
Ok, well thanks! I still disagree about stealth boys; just cause it worked for a single player RPG, does not mean it's a great idea not to tweak it for a MMORPG with FPS elements. I've never heard of a game where someone can go invisible for 6 minutes in combat and not even be able to be knocked out of it temporarily.
---
The sentinel assassin armor issue is interesting, but underlies such an persistent issue that it's not worth hashing out here. When you fix armor legendary effects, you have to fix weapon DPS too.
---
I guess for PvP, critical hits are sort of moot. Just shoot them first, you usually win. If you take a look, they're really powerful for sustained damage, and if you spec right, going 33 LK with unyielding gear, you can critical every other hit... Suddenly, your DPS can triple by holding the "Execute critical hit" button in VATS. 
---
It seems worth noting that folks can dodge that barrage completely by popping a stealth boy, and can never be knocked out of stealth.
---
Or the auto mod does haha
---
Just north of Lake Eloise and due west of the fissure site. Fair warning, I had to replace my camp and start over ~25 times because of the difficulty of initially placing the camp where it encompases both nodes, and halfway up the cliff to get both the flat build areas at the top and bottom. I actually had to place my camp, fast travel inside the wall, then re place it tonget the perfect height and 2 fully buildable areas.
---
There are a ton of mason jars around the game, it would be reasonable to use those for believable in game canning.
---
Both sound good but making certain ones passive like lock picking hacking etc would be a lot nicer
---
Definitely need something for blossoms and flowers.  It's annoying how uncommon they can be.
---
Good idea! 
---
I've messed with survival a little just for fun and curiosity, but I'm waiting a few months before really diving into it.  As we've seen in the original game, "Beta mode" for Bethesda basically means the game isn't finished.   Tod Howard and the other developers basically said so in this recent interview blow. 
---
They said the the main reason they allowed existing characters into the mode was to see how bad PVP was broken so they could fix it. 
---
[https://youtu.be/rfyViQ9Uo\_M](https://youtu.be/rfyViQ9Uo_M)
---
I didn't want to go to the trouble making  a PVP specific build because I'm pretty confident that today's "meta" for PVP could  be useless months from now. 
---
I'd like a player catapult.
---
Hot tub? Don't mind if I do!!-gets in wearing my old crusty t60-
---
Hey, why are you making a video game that has mutants, giant dragon like bats, and superhumans about politics? They have nothing to do with each other, and this conversation wasn't about politics, so why bring them in? 
---
Tannin is another one I only just found today - awesome for those beer challenges
---
There's no particular kinds, you can build in any size or shape or location you want. If you want an adhesive farm, then perhaps have a smaller build, and leave lots of budget for planting crops. You should also look for flat areas with lots of dirt to build on.
---
I like listening to them as well but it's getting hard to find new ones in there.
---
No worries! TY for checking
---
I'm not sure I understand your question.  By jumping up and spamming any of the buttons to interact with the Tinker's station (I chose scrap), the game transported me to standing in front of the Tinker's station inside their camp, which was otherwise closed and locked.
---
Yeah but it's so cluttered and if they're unnecessary I can dump them :)
---
No it's north of the investigator cabin and east of the middle mountain cabins 
---
I‚Äôve never actually been to that lake, had to look it up; will check it out!
---
Huh, I must be missing something here. 400 hrs and I still find stuff to do. Days of grinding, days of gifting, days of SBQ fights, days of no fast travel, days of 3 knives and a shotgun. Game is as much fun as you make it.
---
\*somewhere, "a kiss to build a dream on" just finished playing...\*
---
Good luck! It's been my favorite build so far.
---
I'd rather fight a Scorchbeast than a Colonel Gutsy.
---
There's a set of random apartments near BIVs place and the computer on the top floor had some secrets I couldn't get to. was thinking I'd need a blank holotape, but I dumped them all thinking they were useless. So you never know!
---
Crit to the head with your best rifle, or heavy guns (50 cal, mini) with staggering/armor penetration perks. Don‚Äôt think ‚Äòdefend‚Äô, shoot first, since you don‚Äôt have magic armors like theirs. Sentinel/assassin is the most garbage component in this game today. 
---
Where‚Äôd ya drop it?
---
Really? That became my #1 for that exact reason
---
Are you on Xbox? Wouldn't mind building some for your camp thst way you can still enjoy them! 
---
Quantum MIRV Crossbow!
---
The modern fireplace is sexy
---
Use the shout ‚ÄòDragonrend‚Äô. 
---
Should do the trick. 
---
this is the kind of thing i love finding out. now i get to do research on the differences and why it does that!
---
They drop the rarest plans in the game. They should be hard and annoying. 
---
Yep!
---
We're gonna go SBQ
---
This is my first extravagant build, usually I build a 2 story box but most of the upper level being a patio/balcony area lol
---
Yea fallout 76 will be fine. A lot of the stuff is over dramatic even though I do agree they need to add more quest and end game but that‚Äôs what they are doing. I think we get the crytide quest line next week. I‚Äôm pretty excited for that one. It looks really cool. Also I am curious to see how the vault raid and dungeons work. If I‚Äôm correct they are going to release the dungeons with wild Appalachia and then the vaults with nuclear winter. 
---
Does health increase with level after 50?
---
Attach meat to the bolt and it attracts different predators?
---
I still disagree with stealth boys. There is a perk that allows stealth boys to last longer which is completely valid. You can kill people using stealth boys by highlighting them with berry mentats. Crits are not moot in PvP. It's how, as a level 25 player, I can kill level 90+ players in 1 or 2 shots. We killed a level 283 several times the other day using crits and level 20 hunting rifles who was spawn killing at charleston station. 
---
Staggering someone in SA is how you kill them which is easy with enforcer perk for shotguns.
---
I just don't want Bethesda to do overboard on debuffing weapons or armor which is what I fear they will do.
---
The gameplay is more or less the same as Fo4, there are problems but nothing really standout.
---
The exploration is honestly what this game is about(unless you like building) especially if you can get together with some friends and go raise hell.
---
I would stick to semi as long as you can,I agree with the post above,ammo consumption is something that will always be a pain in the ass,u till you get the ammo smith card,then u can craft like nuts,which you won't get super early I don't believe,the TSE handmade I have is my go to,and I run a melee build.( when enemies are out of reach). Get ur semi game up.
---
It should be free. If they expect us to drop whatever we're doing and fast travel halfway across the map for an event the least they could do is not charge us for it. 
---
Killed her twice this past week. Took 25m each time. Love my cryolator that does extra dmg to ghouls. Ffs.
---
That being said, we noticed her hp was slow to fall but once we switched perks and went to heavy guns she fell pretty quick. 
---
Lololol
---
No, but a lot of people like to play the victim
---
Plus most pvp builds keep their health low anyways üòÇ
---
understandable, think about other named legendarys we all sold straight away though.
---
Lmao 
---
You're right there is a clear delineation between fantasy and reality.The problem comes when you project one into the other.
---
Awesome. We're in the same area then. I think it's getting popular because I keep getting the camp cannot be placed message. However, when I've went and looked, nothing was there. Nice build!
---
Nothing happens after lvl 50. Just cosmetic and perk cards/perc respec.
---
Vendor cap pools follow your character, not the server.  They regenerate slowly over time.  It's still going to be an issue.  I'm pretty sure they did it because dupers were ruining the player economy by server hopping to sell and flooding the world with caps.  Player vending should be here within a week and maybe you'll be able to get some caps for that valuable loot then.
---
Not sure all I know is it gave me the hit markers, they stopped running, teleported a few feet then one hit me lol with a piperifle. 
---
Exactly. Don't mix them.
---
That would be sick! Maybe one day lol once I get the red barn plans I'm going to edit my cabin, but until then it's just brown wood lol
---
agreed. non combat perk cards should be passive. 
---
To get it on Steam you will need to buy it again and make new character, they already said that.
---
Hell I would argue you could hear that blasted tinkerers bench clear into Ohio.
---
Cool if I finish dinner in time I‚Äôll come help. 
---
Im back
---
I do have the dragon, just need to grab that perk that lets you target body parts. 
---
Had the same issue. Had to brew a mess of the alcohol, server hop, drink, shoot, repeat... took 3 tries but made it happen. 
---
dont forget poisoned bolts or glowing steel bolts like in half life 2, the crossbow is nice but it needs mods especially scopes.
---
I also always have my second weapon unequipped. Realizing you have no bullets, and then pulling out fists is a recipe for doom.

Considering there are some plants that are uncommon or literally only have one spawn (looking at you, fever blossom) that‚Äôs a wonderful idea
---
This! This is exactly what I need lol. Also I‚Äôm guilty as anyone!!! I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve ran past lower levels offering trade. To assume they have nothing to bring is kind of dick. You sir lead by example, keep on keeping on
---
It‚Äôs saying you aren‚Äôt online, tried to join you
---
There are no plans for wood armour, and I don't think those suit variants exist in Fallout 76 yet, though I may be wrong.
---
Make a new character specced into stealth, hit level 25, and laugh in mistress of mystery. The "damage equalizer" between levels actually heavily favors some low level builds. Making tons of caps at the expense of those poor level 200s.
---
Flux is required to make the only good ammo that does the highest damage to scorchbeasts.
---
Flux is also required to craft fusion core and late game decontamination showers.
---
There's more I'm sure, I just dont know off the top of my head.
---
Maps: yes
---
Supply reqs: no
---
Plans are hidden in safes sometimes. To me, that's their one redeeming quality in 76. 
---
nice
---
Thanks! It's a pretty central location so I'm expecting it to gain more popularity 
---
How do you get rid of your caps?!
---
Awesome feedback,  thanks man.  I wasn't looking to farm legendaries or anything...  Just One violent night hard mode üòÇ
---
We'll still be in the zone. I just launched
---
If you cant join in on him, im in server. GT: Nesbitt121
---
Wish you were on ps4. I would give you the plans. Here I was proud of my 2 story flat (Its a box). Great to see a real builder put the time in :).
---
It is level 45
---
Join on gt: Nesbitt121

u/valseek and u/BethesdaGameStudios, can yall doing something for us Green Thumbs? 
---

If you say so man, just getting tired of landing 4 headshots and only doing a quarter dmg when they are standing still; but then I hide behind a tree and get one shotted by a hunting rifle. 
---
Anything wasted you can think of:

---
Why not spawn at your base or a different station?
---
I'm playing rn, my gt is urlnightmares, I'll add you
---
would be awesome to have these scanned and available to download or for sale in the bethesda store. 
---
This has me rofl after I read that massive 900 hour guy post. Thank you lolol
---
Easy access to Watoga, WS, Uranium Fever, etc. I think it's the best place to aid in travel, plus it has abundant water and food. My little pond always has 3 small animals and 5-10 plants.
---
Gonna do my best to keep an eye on the oven and shoot some stuff üí™
---
I think it just takes the right location to spark inspiration to build something extravagant.
---
I know very little about Mr. Squeeze to be honest. Still never found him.
---
I couldn't help but notice that no one was answering what I read was a direct question with a simple answer. ;)
---
I like the idea of some protection, as well as the UBER XP because the starting area is a rape fest. I‚Äôm not sure how everything will work out but if we all start at lvl 1 and have to progress from there it‚Äôs gonna be rough, just to get the basic camp items and if it‚Äôs like Minecraft hardcore mode then you die your character is done. Doing the main quest just to get a stupid bed or a basic generator is a death sentence. 
---
I don‚Äôt disagree. But I think the mechanics need another look to maximize fun vs. reward. 
---
*cries in heavy gunner with PA*
---
If you want to snipe go for bloodied weapon with 1x chameleon and 4x unyielding armour, use adrenal reaction mutation perks for rifles with tank killer, nerd rage, bloody mess, commando
---
No Problem :)
---
what about The DeathClaw Traveling Vendor That‚Äôs always dead? And does anyone know what goods or rare goods the vendor in question has?
---
Anybody got some on Xbox ?
---
Waste of time for my melee character to even try
---
They‚Äôre not supposed to be fun. They are one of the few fears left in the game. You‚Äôre not supposed to farm them. If you do take one down they have the rarest rewards in their loot table. If you want BOS armor mods they are one of the few ways to get it. 
---
Do debuffs change the numbers when you view them in VATS with the Awareness perk?
---
Sorry. I meant I wish the game had log cabin walls. Lol. Your place looks good!
---
2nd time I've seen this post...what you're offering is not even close to what you want. I suggest going into your stash and offer something a little better;)
---
Only that they were supposed to always drop Legendary items.  Not of any specific star value. 
---
3 stars only means 
---
\+ possibility of getting something good
