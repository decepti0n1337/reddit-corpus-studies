&gt;I’m not faulting you on that. This method is predatory
---

---
Ultimately that's all I'm saying. I'm a long time Bethesda fan, so I expect them to be better than this, and know they can be.
---
---
---
Agreed. Added weapons keeps people interested. Look at call of duty, it's the same base game, same guns, just run n gun. But they add new weapons for people to play with and it works to bring people back. If fallout did this it would make me interested again. (Although on that topic, I'm suck of grinding the settler rep for that shotgun lol)
---
Still broken for me.
---
Thats a keeper...add the focused mod and you are good to go.
---
Have that one and a zealots.  Both work well against SB’s - zealots has a slight edge for that, but vamp keeps your health up :)
---
Yes, it works, but it’s extremely tedious. I could spend 30 minutes converting a ton of ammo I’ve saved or spend 30 minutes playing the game. Which do you think I’d rather do?
---
2x SCORE would be nice
---
that's why i said "up to". i got 713 for 4th place once today but usually i get 250-350 per match, when i get to top 10. i have the perk that increases damage against creatures so i make sure to kill any enemies in my way, but i avoid players unless they pick a fight, which i tend to lose.
---
Ohhh finally a new post
---
Every day since the beginning. I can do it once on a new character and never again, even weeks later.
---
Welllll I also quit guild wars 2 because of the complete and utter disrespect to lore and shit writing and copy paste content. More currency more grind, more cheevos, and the content is dead within two weeks. The game failed because of this. You can't come back and do all of that stuff, because it's dead content. It's heart breaking to see my favorite franchise go where it has gone, but they shot themselves in the foot.
---
Thanks. That sucks but makes sense.
---
Ha. I change mine all the time to trash or scrap. Easier to keep track of what is good.
---
That's the problem, it's not straight line progression more of an increasingly steep curve. And a big chunk of the first ranks were done with the weekly quest rewards. I think it's going to be an XP drag race after just a few days...that means no time for slow story quests, just banging event after event for a minimum couple of hours a day.
---
Agree, it sucks ass... Cool concept but slowing me down by making me mindlessly press buttons is stupid. Let me set it up to convert all the ammo and walk away instead dog adding to the already overwhelming amount of micromanaging.

I liked Ra-Ra, kinda reminded me of my own kid, so I was nice to her and she was good to me in return, can't complain.
---
I've not had any issues with my other allies, I've finished both *Daguerre and Beckett's* quest lines. I had the first quest for Raider Punk with the quest markers and everything but after swapping him for someone else it doesn't work anymore.
---
They won't ever punish anyone. They have people on a silver platter with the xmas dupes to at the very least purge inventories and they do nothing. All it will lead to is items not being tradeable/sellable in the future and the rest can still prosper. Not to mention NW is near unplayable on PC due to rampant cheating with nothing having been done. They don't care.
---
Player to player trading should work like trading in fo4 with a confirmation before bartering.
---
fair enough lol
---
I'm a pretty aggressive player so my XP rates can be higher. 
---
Earlier I got 15 kills, killed 2 grafton monsters, nuked the last zone and killed the scorchbeast. Along with a bunch of ghouls. I got like 1400, was pretty happy lmao
---
Don't treat any game like it's a job; play because you want to have fun. IMO, you're just being too anal about the challenges, just complete what you can and move on.
---
she comes around if you're nice to her 
---
we have a spirit connection after she helped me in a dire Sentry encounter where I had run out of meds and ammo
---
I laughed the first time. And then I started a second character and skipped through the dialogue. And a third, by which time I wanted to throw her to the Mirelurks.
---
Honestly support would have told you it was being addressed in the next update because they couldn't help you and know its a dev issue, but they wouldn't really know when it is being fixed, this is the first I've actually heard about the issue so chances are it needs some more attention before bethesda take notice and actually do something, so have an upvote.
---
Yeah the game is dying in my eyes. Wastelanders was underwhelming as hell. After doing some research, the only way to get through the Season to 100 is to play all day everyday or pay cash for it. Casuals are punished for not playing religiously. It's sad to see one of my favorite franchises die out like this, but I'll always play 3, New Vegas, and 4. My fallout 4 file is modded to have everything that comes in 76 but in a game that isn't bad.
---
What went through their mind when they decided to do it this way? Do they not realise that this isn't fun? At all?
---
Why do we play videogames again? Bethesda is so out of touch with the community.
---
I know what I'm doing later/tomorrow! Thanks for this!
---
At least the seasons are free so anything you do end up with is free shit (unless of course you decide to pay). RDRO had that outlaw pass that was basically the same as this except progression was tied to xp only and it costs $5 or $10 in gold to take part. At least here I'm not really out anything if I don't finish because I didn't have to invest to join. 
---
I just accept that I'm not going to get everything and do what I find fun in the game and pick up the easy challenges here and there. Sure I'd like to get all the stuff but I just don't care enough to make a job of it, I'll get what I can and forget about what I can't.
---
I created "Gary 1" today for just this purpose. I'll just delete him and start again with Gary 2 when he gets too high to do it quickly.
---
12
---
*CONFUSED SCREAMING*
---
U dont need alot of effort for them though and thats the point of a battlepass
---
Enjoy the game!
---
I would like to know who was the genius who thought that converting 12 rounds at a time was great idea.
---
Genius! My son is always begging me to play and I never want him to screw up my build but I might just let him play NW!
---
Build up camp weekly gave me nothing. Husband also did it and he also got nothing.
---
It seems like it was hard for you to type all that through the tears. “Selling your ammo”. Do you have great success selling .38, 40mm, and fuel? No? Me neither. If you were banking on a lvl 4 reward to replace every method you currently use for crafting or obtaining ammo, then I don’t think there’s anything I can say that will help. Combining the converter with ammo machine (raiders) and lead farming should surplus your stock. 
---
I do agree the menus are rudimentary, but it’s not impossible to navigate.
---
Can only agree with you... Was in NW yesterday and god killed from the otjer side of map. It was awsome.
---
Thats realy sad to see, some of us like thos game.
---
My 2 cents
---
I've always loved, all of the fallout games, I'd go back to fallout 3 and start a new game any day but something about 76 was off from the start.
---
I bought the tricentennial edition for ps4, then just before wastelanders I bought the standard edition for PC.
---
I played fallout series for it's progressing storyline but all of these repeating events, "another settlement is in trouble."(-How it feels) never ending grinding for gold buillion, atoms and now this S.C.O.R.E .....
---
I knew fallout 76 would be very buggy from launch because fallout has always been a single player experience, so as a die hard fan of the fallout series I just wanted a co-op fallout 3 / NV or even fallout 4.
---
Good on bethesda for trying, but I think an evolving seasonal timeline would be a great idea.
---
Think of the idea like how fortnite has done it.
---
I will, and you won’t be missed
---
I haven't been getting my Legendary Run points for the challenges I've been completing anyway so I'm just boned I guess
---
Yep, I logged into GW2 daily since  launch and one I thought, why? I haven't logged in since. I started to have more real life stuff keeping me from playing like I once did and my wife and I couldn't finish it because it was mostly dead by the time we could. We met playing that game and it was kind of a weird feeling dropping something you've loved since the launch of GW1
---
The only problem I have with your math is it doesn't sound fun. I finish up my job which I don't enjoy, and then straight into having to grind which I don't enjoy. But good on you for doing this.
---
How do I do that on Xbox
---
These GD kids have no respect, this is what happens when society decides you shouldn't beat them anymore.
---
so....Legendary perks are still coming the way they planned before or are they still going to rework them? The trailer still showed the 'old' concepts.
---
Quit playing then. Simple. As. That.
---
the slow rate of turning in ammo needs to be fixed, LEt us put all ammo of a type not 100 5mm at a time
---
I put a ticket in and they’re saying that some of them are giving credit at 3/5, so when you hit 5/5 you already got it. 
---
I don’t think that’s what happened to me though. I feel like if I got credit for both I’d be past step 5.
---
I'll take it! :)
---
you don’t need to put 3 laughing emojis in every sentence you type
---
But I was playing by myself at the time
---

---
It may not be eligible as a Nuclear Winter skin.  
---
I couldn't apply it, but I had no problem applying the Vault-Tec paint to my laser rifles or the Atomic Camo to my wood and scout armors.
---
I really thought this was fixed. It's not, and it's infuriating, and my build relies on VATS and is utter trash as a result. Just did Line in the Sand earlier, game turned into a total slideshow with the rockets going off, and I can't even rely on 95% to mean anything when no way in hell was I able to aim at 15 FPS.
---
Raider Punk doesn't have a detailed questline like Beckett and Daguerre do, he only has a daily random quest like "rescue this dude" or "kill this monster".  Beckett and Daguerre are supposed to also offer dailies after you complete their quest lines, however like the Raider Punk, they seem to be bugged and stop offering it.
---
Your credit card went through their minds I’m sure lol. 
---
Now that you can’t earn atoms

Yup. That ammo sells just fine. And if it doesn't sell, I much rather gift it to a lower level than sit through 20 minutes of bad navigation. And you keep using it's low score level requirement as a justification for it being poorly designed. Hell, you can't even get fuel right now because they forgot to put it in the ammo list on payouts. You're not going to convince anyone that the shit you're shoveling into your mouth is anything but just that. It's shit.
---
They need to shut down the game, redo everything and put it back, FF14 style, we need a fallout 76 2.0 with upgraded engine for a mmo.
---
Are you okay? Do you need to talk to someone? Wheres the aggression coming from? If you just wanna argue, that's not what I'm here for, but I can talk if you need to.
---
Exactly, why do you think the game is so laggy all the time? Cause Sofia is causing a ruckus at your camp
---
I'm glad your fighting the good fight on this one.  I guess you and I are the only.ones who used it.
---
Delusional dumb ass is what you are, even it were 2000, you trading in 5500 atoms for items that they pick. 
---
You're getting fucked without lube by daddy tod and sadly you seem to be enjoying it. 
---
Do me a favor and don't cry when you realise how fucked up this game has become.
---
And sadly it can only get worse as seasons progress and chasing xp becomes the all consuming evil. The race to reach 100 will mean dropping QOL and going full-on damage mode for the more obsessed.
---
Well.  They need to fix it.  Either way it isn’t working right.  And I don’t think that’s what happened either. I’m pretty sure I didn’t get my points.  I did that one all at once at Tyler county dirt track. So I am pretty sure I’d have noticed it had I gotten a chunk early.
---
[This article dated back to 2016](https://www.google.com/amp/s/gamelust.com/news/huge-share-zenimax-media-possibly-for-sale/amp/). The video I attached to the post also talks about it further into detail with sources
---
Tbf most "seasons" in most games are neigh impossible for casuals to complete due to time limitations. So really this just seems to be right on par with any other game. If you have the time to grind you can do it. If you don't then you can't. At least they added a way you can pay to complete, most games don't have anything like that.
---
I’m very glad to see the misinformation being cleared up but I would like to share a bad experience I’ve had. Yesterday on the drop of seasons I completed all daily challenges but received the reward for only three of them. I also completed some of the weekly challenges but didn’t receive the reward for them either, I’m uncertain if anyone else has experienced an issue like that but I wanted to share what I’ve been through so other people can watch out for this bug. I’ve also reported it to Bethesda.
---
Same. Full time dad life. I see these posts and think... It takes about 20 mins to do the dailies and the weeklies aren't hard. If you play an average amount you'll level up and boost the game card. Jump in a team and its even better.
---
Ah alright, I can do all that
---
Can't grasp the decisions made on it. It's like some weird internal joke we should recognise and acknowledge. It's probably the same guy that thought 200 daily bullion buyout paired with 500+ bullion plan cost was excellent idea.
---
Ha! ha! You had your laugh. We don't get it.
---
I really wanted that NW beanie, so as long as I can earn it before they fix their shit Im not complaining lol
---
Each one uglier than the next.
---
This is pretty easy to do on a regular basis. Just join a NW match, get into the match, get killed, disconnect and reconnect to adventure mode and the barriers should now be gone. Some say you need to have you camp or ST near the border so you can spawn in at that point but from my testing it seems all you need to do is join NW, die, join adventure and poof the barriers are gone. I’ve explored pretty much all 4 sides of the map and it seems there’s nothing really interesting to find. Eventually if you go too far in any one direction you’ll just fall through the map.
---
Are you also providing mirelurk meat to Blackeye (?) at Ohio River Adventure for some added Rep.? As well as "Photo Opportunity" turning in the photos to Kyomi (spelling) at Crater?
---
100% agree with you. Good idea, but it was poorly executed.
---
Lol, ok ok, you're fine =p but seriously, went to uranium fever with a friend who wanted to try playing again, and every miner was ohk by some jackass, and he decided nope that was his problem the first time around.
---
Yeah I totally agree. Doesn’t seem like it is working right. Tech-support also says they can’t change the score value so there’s nothing they can do about it anyways
---
Some people are trying to find a reason in Bethesda trying to stop duping with it. Though to me that would seem like putting a city under lockdown because a jewelry store in town could potentially be robbed one day. Might as well shut the whole servers down if we're going that level of 'prevent duping at all costs' if it costs the sanity of normal players.
---
Also this
---
I thought they would add some content, instead the literally gave us the same grind with different rewards. No new missions at all.
---
Ra-Ra is like Tiny Tina with all the god awful "lol so random" bullshit removed. I loved her and Gail.
---
What is very well rested?
---
Right. And most of the time if I lose 2 (maybe I only have 2) then I have to FAST TRAVEL to repair. God I hate loading screens.
---
Every game has those Math threads that try to claim things will be impossible to complete or will cost thousands of dollars to get everything. They're almost always bullshit using bad math and missing information.
---
And even more clicking
---
i wish you good luck, seems we can keep the rewards, but bethesda seems to fix these unofficial events.

BGS (the studios that makes F76) is owned by “ZeniMax”. However ZeniMax gets its money from investors. Therefore ZeniMax also being partially owned and not an individual company
---
That's the point, the numbers look better if you play every day, not how much you play. That's why they are adding incentives to play daily, and honestly at this point it seems pretty engrained in their design.
---
Haven't seen him in the garden, but he was playing an instrument before, and also half-clipped through his trailer wall another time. Because Ward.
---
If you initiate the radio tubes one by talking to wren you can start Roxy's the next day and do them both. But if you dont initiate one one day you'll only get one daily the next day.
---
I can agree with you on the idea of not wanting to play up until a daily limit. It should let you grind out every level in a few days, if you choose to.
---
For one, my PSN membership just expired and I will not renew it for another week or so and within that week I am losing precious time to grind the season. I’m happy and afraid of this update, we will have to see what the result is.
---
What would Oxhorn think Todd?
---
I'll just keep to gifting the .38 rounds to low levels or put them in suitcases at trainstations, the converter really isn't worth giving up on gifting and sharing like some did in the past
---
I'm also complaining about the game not giving me the daily score challenges today....
---
Also they didn't fix ward, as he still wanders all over the map now, not just in foundation, they didn't fix god mode, that still works! They didn't fix the unencumbered while dead bug! They broke adrenaline, a vital damage perk!
---
You’re absolutely correct. They are in their right to make money. However it isn’t right to falsely advertise to make money
---
Really? That sucks. I used to do it all the time. For me, it's only broken since last update.
---
"Regularly" is not a option when you have to complete every daily and weekly, you're so out of loop mate. 
---
Stop defending this bullshit system.
---
There's enough legendarys around in the wild to get your 150 scrip in no time, and the ones in events give crap items 99% of the time anyway
---
I am level 570 and have played this game solo from the first.   When you are done with the quests the game is what you make of it.    
---
I can say that at level 70ish you still have some work to do on your build.    Unless you were super lucky.   I was close to level 100 before I felt my build was dialed in.   
---
If your build is done then you can do what the rest of us do.
---
Start collecting.   I started with plans.   Serum plans then the rest.   Now when I go to vendors their is nothing I do not know.    If I do find a gem I buy it.    Presently I am trying to get the BOS power armor paint.  
---
In the mean time I farm cranberry relish, steal, and lead.    
---
My routine right now is to search the silos for tech data, and drop it off on the way to nuking the queen.   Do this for all three silos then hit encrypted.    
---
In the end, if you enjoy the game play it.    Make your own quests.
---
More like 5-10. It's also rough to do while also trying to shoot something (like maybe you want your turrets back on line to help deal with that Scorchbeast or Sheepsquatch or pack of super mutants or ghouls or radscorpions)
---
Shucks
---
Parrot...
---
Yes, it's not working at all.
---
There is another thread on here saying some people have exploited XP and already finished it all the way to level 100.
---
I get upset but honestly it’s whatever
---
8 Year Olds Dude
---
I am curious about this too. To my knowledge, PC Game Pass games have their own corresponding Microsoft Store PC version and are Play Anywhere games, which to my knowledge doesn't currently exist for 76. So will it require installing and using BethesdaNet? As you posed, will they be matched on PC servers? Will it be getting the Play Anywhere tag and possible cross-progression? I mean, obviously we'll find out soon enough, but still, plenty of curiosity over here
---
Teso has a bigger and more experienced team for a mmo, when you look at the ammo CONVERTER that bethesda austin put in the game, you understand.
---
15\*5 is 75
---
Yes, absolutely. Unfortunately a major perk for my build that I have 5 points invested in.
---
Yea already did that
---
You son of a bitch, you’re right!
---
It’s not about effort, it’s about the available SCORE per day. What I’m saying is, if I do not play for one day, the available 1000 score I could have earned is no longer available for me to earn unless I 100,000 XP the next day. If I don’t do dailies for 3 days, those three days of easy effort dailies then has to be made up through 300,000 XP. Does that make sense? It’s not about effort, it’s about playing it at your leisure rather than feeling forced to log on everyday to make sure you don’t fall behind.
---
And that’s not the point of a battle pass, that’s the point of *this* battle pass to trap players into playing EVERYDAY, thus making their FO1st subscriptions justified.
---
Can confirm isnt working for me either
---
That is very true! I’m happy to see this as well!
---
Did nobody notice that the character was carrying 4051 lbs, was wearing PA with no fusion cores, and had no AP because of all the debuffs
---
It worked!  Thank you.
---
honestly I'm fine with a buggy ass game with more content added instead lol, game's hilarious
---
Sleeping on bed.  Til it tells you.
---
&gt; It's dumb, but it works
---
This is the way!
---
Kindled spirit another
---
So I get a message that one of my team mates finished an event and I’m not getting SCORE?  Why tell me he  finished an event?
---
She kinda feels like an annoying rip-off of Tiny Tina.
---
Oh okay - I literally just got a daily quest from Beckett today, unless it bugs out after you swap allies in or out? I'll investigate next time I play. I'll also need to check what Settler Forager does as I don't think I've started his quests yet.
---
I let my 3 year old craft ammo......better than me wearing out a X button.
---
Great guide, grabbed your pdf of the nexus for a more up to date version.
---
My experience with some of these settings
---
Both of these:
---
bScreenSpaceReflections
---
bVolumetricLightingEnable
---
when placed in the Fallout76Custom.ini file, do not override the settings in the Fallout76Prefs.ini file. From my experiences, I had to change it in the Prefs file directly. Not sure why

Yeah I’d be curious to know myself, 7600 hrs should honestly get 7600 atoms, IMO
---
I only do it if people do nothing to contribute to the event or if they are being assholes. It’s kind of nice returning the favor 😊
---
I've posted this elsewhere, but:
---
Next week's 'Repeatable' challenge will probably be 'Complete a Public Event', this is likely what the FAQ is referring to. People claiming to get SCORE from Events are (likely) misreading SCORE they are earning from the XP repeatable, or dailies.
---
Source from the files: "SCORE_Challenge_Weekly_QuestComplete_Events_RECURRING "REPEATABLE: Complete a Public Event" [CHAL:005C5E4A]" There are only 2 of these 'Repeatable' challenges that I can see, the XP one and this one.
---
I’m just getting on now. I’ll find out if I can or not.  I have an underground camp as well.
---
It's almost as if they need Community Managers... Oh wait...
---
Mine worked today. Try resetting or a different server.
---
Same~ 
---
Just thinking at this point we'll have to wait and see but I suppose we will find out soon enough.
---
no, it's not.  Your math is wrong.
---
Could work with a similar system to the advanced conduit piping!
---
Gonna start the Witcher. Never played it and it looks awesome
---
I already restarted my game, and I tried making 2 new entrances with another bass and a banjo, and I cant get underground at all

Me too. Don’t know what to use I’m the meantime...

I was just reading the [patch notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/47XE9Dbh3weAd5kusOIA8p/fallout-76-update-20-patch-notes-june-30-2020) and supposedly both Beckett and Raider Punk had an issue that prevented daily quests from being given.
---
&gt;**Allies:** Beckett now correctly offers Daily Quests after completing his main questline.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;**Allies:** Fixed an issue that could prevent the Raider Punk from offering the player new Daily Quests.
---
Hopefully its working now, have only had one day of patch 20 to verify this
---
They're hoping people forget they ever talked about workshop persistence. That needs to be brought up more often until they say something about it!
---
amen brother, the game and watching the rage on the subreddit, shits hilarious lmao
---
Or infinite, that would help keep my weight down!
---
And gauss miniguns need TWO legendary modules!
---
\&gt;pvp
---
lol
---
legacies are also largely useless against the queen.
---
Yes, that's the lazy route and your punishment for it is not building up the exp bethesda may have otherwise expected you to when they designed this system.
---
Not only did they take your 5500 extra atoms during that period, you also decided to throw away the atoms earned from the score rewards to hop a few levels..
---
Not this time I’m afraid. Not this time.
---
Fed76 puts that weapon at above max caps, so going off of that I’d say keeeeeeeep even if you don’t use it. Feds not always 100% tho so be open to offers.
---
Collector without any argument, you just set it up and let it do its job for a while until you come back and empty its storage. (might suggest locking both of the access ports though)
---
Well that or we are super nerdy one of the two or maybe both I dont know
---
It's a tough one. 
---
On one hand, if you could complete things as you wanted without them being time gated or having daily limits, people would burn through it all in a week and then not log on again until the next update months away while complaining there is nothing to do.
---
If you do content as they currently are, while they keep you logging in dailt, you play for a small amount of time and then go play something else for the day. It gets to the point where you wonder if loading the game up and logging on for an hour is even worth it and should you just move on all together.
---
They cannot create content at the rate that we can consume it. It just isn't possible. Especially as a lot of players here expect it all for free. Even if the whole game ran on a paid subscription, they wouldn't be able to make enough content.
---
Yeah what we have isn't perfect. Free reign with zero limits on progression wouldn't be great for the health of the game either.
---
Anyone got any good suggestions?
---
I just meant PVE in general, using her only as an example.
---
Idk I don’t want to spend atoms on a bunch of thinks I don’t want just to get one or two items
---
cant BEat em join em
---
Specially since those ghilie cosmetic skins can't be used in Nuclear Winter!
---
This post is why we have indoor plumbing today. Someone was like just connect it to the house.. just do it.
---
The Great Lord Atom died for these Ghillie suits.
---
Ah i didn't think it wad going to be as bad as you put it. Having to play has ruined previous game for me with seasons so personally I'm just going to play as I used to and see where it lands
---
 I probably dont complete even 10% of the challenges over a month even though I play 5 days out of 7
---
Nope you won’t. 
---
But keep in mind the new maths on this topic seems the get you closer 100. But still not 100. And that is if you also do the NW dailies. Which I personally never will. Then it will take even longer
---
Every day the purveyor hat 7 or 10 legendary modules (I forget) but you can only afford to get 3 or 4! That drives me nuts!
---
I don’t have an inventory of god rolls or a few hundred extra bucks laying around in my paypal, so i don’t think i will lol
---
thank you, added it to the doc
---
Omg I was doing events and not realizing it while watching Netflix.   I honestly thought events gave score so I’ve been kinda jumping in on some of the shitty ones.  F me
---
Go for it! It's been said before. Probably good to say it again. =)
---
Well you have better luck than I do. I’ve had 1000s of .38 offered for 0 caps, no takers. So having a bunch of .38 that I can either drop or put into a converter and get what I want (it’s not fuel), I’ll go through the menus at my camp for a few hundred .556, or .308. What I’m gathering from all of this is that there’s no real “bug”, it’s just the menus that are the trouble. 
---
They are poorly done, but again.. it still works.
---
Nice one, thanks for the info 👍
---
Think Raider Punk is still bugged for me then as this happened just before I posted this (after patch). Or maybe the patch didn't work lol
---
Edit: Failed quest was ages ago
---
Well, mine worked 3 hours ago... I doubt they patched that glitch since then. It’s prob also not very high on their priority list... You tried different foundations, stairs &amp; base or the same foundation that previously worked?
---
You get wanted for 5 caps. 😂 why are you crying over 5 caps?
---
Don't we also get the option to move up a level using atoms a week after it launches?  Do we know if the atom cost is a flat amount or will it rise according to the SCORE we need?  If it's a flat cost, you could use the atoms we get from the thing on the last few levels to reduce the amount of SCORE by a significant amount
---
it's not just that. you're forgetting the pvp damage cap as well. a bloodied build is probably the worst thing you could use to pvp.
---
JE laser and plasma is where it's at.
---
This whole community operates on misinformation. It's like the star wars community at this point except somehow slightly worse. It also makes literally every issue that is a molehill into a fucking mountain. It's been a problem since the game was announced and it will be a problem until the game gets shut down like these people want.
---
Like...At this point hating the game is a fucking meme.
---
*Their
---
I agree with you but since it doesn't directly affect Bethesda's bottom line like people quitting their sub due to the vendor/display case issue, they just don't care.
---
I wouldn't be at all surprised if we're in exactly the same position with this a year from now.
---
Best I can do is a nocturnal +40 bash pipe rifle.
---
Invite to team like you used to. They are private teams.
---
score mania and ammo outrage rule the day
---
\&gt; Very Well Rested (1h): XP +100% 
---
Is it a buff in the lunch box?
---
This is probably gonna sound pretty bad. But imo, the more people that don’t reach rank 100 the better. That way the higher tier rewards will actually be rare. The rarer the better
---
I agree, but I’d like to see a counter of posts about this topic and how many times Bethesda has given two shits about it.
---
That's funny because I have the tricentennial edition and it has never showed up for me.
---
is it fixed? because I am not getting much while i have been playing a lot.
---
You missed the BE reference in there
---
Literally 40 posts+ a day with all bitching... like dude why do you keep playing? If you really dont like the game go away. These bleeding heart posts about not having enough time to play and shit get on my nerves too. This is literally every other game. CoD has battlepasses man. Gaming as a subscription is becoming a thing whether people like it or not. Virtually every online game right now has season and purchasable content. Yeah your camp might not be as cool as someone elses, you might not have that cool ass skin, so what. Lol if you play CoD, Apex, Siege whatever tf. Its all about the grind baby!!!!! Fuck even someof the most famous games ever is doing the same raids over and over man. Look at WoW. Ha
---
Oh no dude it’s fine I’m just ranting ur good
---
ugh  thanks, i have 5 points tied up in it
---
Was this at night? I know he was known for jamming out at night, maybe he stays at his desk during daylight hours but then chills out and jams before fucking off for a snooze at night?
---
I mean yea but hopefully our lives don’t devolve to that level haha. I just think it’s pretty out of touch for Bethesda to even think that’s ok. I mean the devs have lives of their own, how could they remotely think that’s rational beyond forcing players to buy levels
---
Seems the Christmas rewards cost more xp than before, as I've unlocked the Halloween combat rifle, but not the winter metal armor, those who are supposed to unlock at the same amount of xp!
---
I just raise my stats high enough so they cant damage me. My energy resist is over 700 with a ballistic resist of around 400. On top of that my armor is Assassin Sentinel so most legacies do very little damage to me.
---
Sorry, hoped I could help out.
---
Do you feel the need to announce your status to the game forums of everything you play, or you think this one owes you something for some reason?
---
I've tried 2 foundations, I'm going through every instrument now, (I'm so far on the tuba) and ive only seen metal stairs so I'm only using those
---
Exactly. When not on a team, find the player you want to be on your team and (barring they are not on a team) invite them to team. Don't go to the public party tab and start a party.
---
Dude then stop playing if it's not fun for u but  obviously you care enough to spend your time complaining (about somthing free) and I see so maybe people bitchin about how long its gonna take to grind but not a single challenge has takin me longer than 5mins (except leving)
---
Besides this post was supposed to be a joke, but some of you are BUTT HURT
---
How do you level up in under an hour when you’re 300+? Run Wes tek fully buffed? I guess it’s doable but not exactly fun content. Just a straight up daily grind
---
I'm pretty sure he has a 24 hour cooldown on quests.  So if you failed his quest, you won't be able to get another until 24 hours later.  I'd check back a couple times through the week and see whether he offers you a daily.  I know he definitely offered me one last night, when he had failed to offer me one for several days in a row prior to patch 20.  I'll check again tonight and see how it goes for me.
---
Works now, some reason takes a few seconds for the option to come up or something. Thank you.
---
It must be all about time as my last two first place matches I only got 800 and 900 respectively!
---
I was 125 yesterday, yet they still tried lol
---
just hit 14 an im all rdy feeling the burn lol
---
 you made me feel a little bit better and that’s all the help I needed honestly
---
How much did they pay you?
---
Maybe those buddhists were onto something when they talk about letting go of desire because it only brings unhappiness.
---
Mine worked.  Sorry your having issues
---
Wait, it actually works in NW now? I unlocked it yesterday and my wood armor in that mode didn't change and I couldn't even mark it as a NW favorite from the atom shop.
---
Hey my guy, pick up a flamer and you're one of the crew. Join the flamer gang, there's like 4 of us in existence lmao
---
And let’s be honest. There’s always one daily that you just don’t want to bother with (usually). that’ll be about 1750 XP weekly you’re missing out on. 
---
That will leave you 7000xp (Aprox. 7 levels) behind from the ones just doing one more quest than you, monthly. Leaving you in the end up in 19.250score xp behind from all 11 weeks, that you have to catch up with the repeatable 100score per 10.000xp earned.  That’s almost 200 times more you have to do the repeatable. 
---
And that’s if you do ALL but one task every single day.
---
But it was designed to get your wallet out. Now that we can’t earn atoms. I’m sure
---
How do you achieve such high DR without Vanguards? I’m trying to hit something similar
---
If you have a job and can’t play, then you have the money to skip the challenges with atoms
---
- Bethesda logic
---
I love this, good reference.
---
good on you, i sure did hahah
---
no worries I was just curious because my camp took me forever to build and don't really wanna lose it, I hope it resolves itself soon
---
God speed!
---
Dude that is so true lol honestly I might just stop looking for a little bit
---
100 or less..
---
exceptions being very rare materials ex: ballistic fiber
---
or materials you constantly are crafting with ex: lead, steel acid
---
most things I keep between 25-75.. 
---
you probably dont need that 800 glass..
---
Light footed.
---
Hop server's should be open.
---
Have you tried the personal computer. I’ve seen some camps using that.they do take forever. That’s why I won’t move. Lol
---
Maybe it's the effect of multiple lunch boxes around you.
---
Maybe they've finally fixed some bugs.
---
How is there zero margin for error you must not be very good at math if you add everything up doing the all the daily's and weekly challenges you will only end up 5k score shy of completely finishing which can easily be supplemented by the repeatable xp challenge
---
And since when has any game with this system ever made it easy to complete
---
Someone that likes the enclave too much.
---
You have to scrap most weapons to get mods, but the single action has very few mods. Prime Receiver and Ivory grips I believe.
---
I did all the weekly challenges in less than 30 mins
---
Every week we can get 21,500 from challenges assuming they are consistent, we need around 223,000 score to get to max rank in season, doing all challenges every week gets us to 215,000 score. That means we need 8,000 more to get to max. Assuming that the xp challenge will be available every week (my guess is that every week that challenge will change to something else being repeatable but I don’t know that so let’s assume Bethesda will be consistent with the xp challenge) that means we need to get 800,000 xp in order to get max rank, that’s a lot. Clearly they designed the season so players need to spend atoms in order to reach max rank.
---
What did your math work out to be for time to get to max rank?
---
That’s because they want completionists who have a life to buy the remaining ranks with atoms. It’s designed this way on purpose to get people to spend. This is ZeniMax 101
---
Haha.. nice.   You bet!   Flame on!
---
What if we use science to spread information about the season grind?
---
Or worse, they're young enough to have grown up playing nothing but games littered with f2p poppycock and tomfoolery. And truly believe that there is no way a company could offer a functioning game that kept the servers running AND added content (say like the Diablo franchise) for just a simple upfront cost.
---
Every experience they've had with games has been heavily monetized post launch. And that is just so incredibly depressing as an almost elderly gamer who's getting too old for this shit.
---
Insulated backpack, ironclad perk, evasive perk, grounded mutation and scaly skins (strange in number if on a team), full AssApSent Heavy Leather. I do also rely on things like dodgy, lone wanderer, serendipity,  and theres a lot of really powerful aid out there
---
No no, i very much am remembering that. My friend and i spent over and hour in my camp last night testing numbers, and with JE weapons i might not always hit damage cap on him bc of his high resistances, but it doesn’t matter because of his low health. It was literally just a one-shot-fest of whoever got VATS first lmao. 
---
Having 400 health and having 80 health makes little difference when it’s an instantaneous hail of explosive gunfire. The shit just makes no sense lol
---
I enjoyed GW2 for the first 5 years or so. The Heart of Thorns expansion pack was fantastic. Eventually you get tired of the same game.
---
I forgot how often they said that skins and whatever else were supposed to be added for fallout1st,  to be honest. But I do think that they have kept a flow of content, so I do not really agree that it was false advertising. I think that there are people just looking for reasons to complain, and to have something to talk about ( especially in the case of YouTubers). I think having a private server, the tent and the scrap box, to me anyway, are what make fallout 1st worthwhile. So I'm happy with it.
---
I use all of that minus insulated backpack, evasive, lone wanderer, and serendipity. And obv not the armor either. Why leather instead of something better/grinding SS versions?
---
The combat challenges aren't enough to offset what atoms you could potentially earn. It's not a good change. Look's like they just wanted an excuse for people to not earn atoms any more. Really really not friendly nor cool.
---
Lol I'm sorry I dont see where I asked you for anything? I announced my REASON because its pertinent to this subreddit or have u not seen the 8 million posts of ppl saying "endgame sucks" ect? I didnt think stating that it's okay to give up on a game you got your money out of, was me asking you for anything?
---
Im having a difficult time giving a shit due to adrenaline being broken...
---
I keep about 100 to 150 of everything with the exception of lead which I usually hoard up in case I want to make a bunch of a certain kind of ammo.
---
People on this sub just like to complain about anything and everything.
---
What's even funnier is seeing game ideas given rewards in the hopes devs see and implement their ideas, lol.
---
Leather give the most energy resist out of all the armors
---
Pete knows about this. Or that’s what the song on the radio says lol
---
Shoot me a message on XB and I’ll look on my mule. Same GT as here.
---
The ghilie armors can't be used in Nuclear Winter!
---
By rank 11, you've earned around 10,000 score. You need over 220,000 score to complete the season pass. So you're only about 4% of the way there.
---
The ivory grip plans are found everywhere.
---
Congrats, you are the hundredth post about the ammo converter!
---
Haha man you’re gonna jinx me lol 😤
---
Hence my statement ‘if that’s all you are focused on.’
---
I feel like adrenalin being broken does need a lot more attention and seriously needs a hot fix ASAP
---
Dude the pass is here for 3 months
---
Same here. No score was awarded for the challenges that I had to do in building mode from today's daily or the weekly.
---
Please do. The game is trash at this point. Start over with a game that doesn't have 12 currencies, constant bugs, glitches, and crashes over two years after release, and a reliance on people with disposable incomes instead of being (I don't know) for people who like the story and lore that Fallout used to be about.
---
Why don’t they just give you the rewards even if you don’t finish the challenges? Seems unfair that players that put time and effort into the game should be rewarded more than players that don’t have time to play.
---
I am so close to lvl 50, then I'll do scorched earth again, just so the gear drop will be 50.  I'll put myself on mob spawn duty.   👍
---
Just showed up. Xbox though.
---
And past seasonal content from Bethesda has never shown up in the atom store again? Ever?    
---
Oh, wait, this is the first damn one they've done, so you have no damn idea if they'll bring old stuff back or not.     
---
Chill the fuck out.
---
Correction... they don't play any games. Except maybe some super grindy mobile f2p.
---
Nothing about the UI, gameplay loop or cost in this game is the work of anyone who is even moderately aware of PC/console gaming, let alone a gamer.
---
Yep, I actually enjoyed what they brought with HoT, except Tangled Depths. It was a lot of fun. The build up to PoF and the shit show that followed was what ruined it for me
---
Right, yeah. Is that objectively better than ballistic resistance? Or is it just to have a leg up on the legacy weapons?
---
Its really not that bad man. Lol i dont understand how you guys are so mad at some of this stuff.
---
ok I will thank you! Yeah hanks for keeping me from snapping my disk lol
---
You deleted that fast
---
I agree completely. Battlepasses and their like need to go die in a fire. They are the new lootboxes.
---
Honestly heavy guns and vats don't mix to well for me.i just spray it.if it works for you enjoy it!
---
Because we played Fallout games that were actually well made.
---
I’ve seen and played worse rates. Idm much as long as the challenges stay fast, easy and are not stupid like the challenges long time ago like taking a picture of someone In mystery outfit inside a nuke zone.
---
yeah this is gonna get a rule 9 lol
---
you definitely got them
---
Both great emo band names.
---
Ive played them all too, multiple times through. How does this game depend on disposable income? Because you cant get some of the cool stuff for your camp that others have... every online game ever.
---
Don't think so ... Just teasers. The radio broadcast suggests "Brotherhood .... Coming ..." Or something like that.
---
please kill me...
---
Yeah, “first expeditionary force”
---
Same
---
If you have something that seems like a somewhat decent roll but for something you don't actually want...hold onto it, because someone is probably looking for it.
---
I traded 2 radium rifles for a bloodied fixer to a guy I ran into on this sub. Everyone is looking for something.
---
Frankly, I love the seasons concept. Although the grind might be a lil much. As an guy in his late 20s with a 50 to 60 hour work week, 3 days of being on the road. I'll never complete the grind as is. And several adults that I have spoken with are in a similar boat only having maybe an hour a few nights a week, and on a weekend with no commitments, maybe a 10 hour session and that's generous. I understand the desire for a 'grind,' but even dedicated fans may not get close... Without dumping money into leveling.... 
---
My thought is reduce the grind total by about 25%. Then whatever the amount of SCORE is need to go from 99 to 100, keep repeating it  after 100 (similar to Division 2 for those that have reached the end game) and for the reward, a pool of Vault-Tec caches, lunchboxes, and card packs. Nothing too special, but still something to incentivize continued playing after completion.
---
Lastly, someone at Beth needs to call the folks that work on ESO on how to monetize a game.....
---
 same here bud
---
I believe it is a flat 150 atoms per level, unless they changed it.
---
I don’t think you know what a margin of error is
---
Any weapon that does energy damage
---
It's a tease for next season, Steel Dawn is coming Fall this year (supposedly)
---
I'd be happy even if they only bumped it up to 160.
---
Man if you can't see the issues with this game it ain't my job to spell it out. You made a post about us hating the game, if you can't see why you're clearly part of the problem.
---
Thank you for depressing me. Have my up-vote anyway
---
Bethesda needs to nail his ass down.
---
Oh yeah thank you I mean I’m sure I have stuff people want like a 2 shot 25/25 gauss rifle but people never really offer and it makes me lose hope
---
For real, I've only played for a couple hours the last two nights and already finished all my dailies and all but one of my weeklies... And already at level 10.
---
yes exactly.
---
Yes, it is exactly the same. You get more XP the more intelligence points you have
---
The perk card addrealine is not working at all for me.
---
Yes each point gives a 2% boost. Spread the word so people only make and join building public teams as it is far and away the best option for a team. So far it's about 80% events or hunting teams to me.
---
Went to visit a vendor camp yesterday and it was a cooking station, but using it didn't actually take you in. Something maybe changed.
---
or let us turn in a 3* weapon for that 30 scrip instead of having to hunt down other items
---
I mean they'll let us keep turning scrip in even when we're capped but they won't let us take a loss just to bottom out our daily.
---
Mine are still shredding 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
&gt; People who don’t play much will still get rewarded but players who actively support the game will get more rewards.
---
That was also the case before this update, only people were earning Atoms. You could buy whatever you wanted in the shop with those. 
---
With the season pass, the amount of Atoms you can earn has been reduced from over 6000 to 1500, and at the same time they made those Atoms harder to obtain because you have to work through the trash in the rest of the season pass to get them.
---
Yes, all INT increases your xp. Not just base. I'm running around with 40 :)
---
And how many official responses have we gotten about it yet? The item needs a rework. We need to keep bugging them about it until they promise one.
---
Spam
---
is
---
bad.
---
Im not saying there arent issues, lol im saying that they arent as bad as you guys are acting like they are.
---
**I'm loving this patch.** Respawn bug is fixed! Probably getting the Fast Travel Bug like 90% less! Way more stability, and decreased load times! I never even bothered to intentionally do the challenges before cos they felt like much more of a chore, whereas I'm enjoying them a lot more now! I only have 1 point in adrenaline due to the *severe* diminishing returns after rank 1, and I'm melee so I don't use the Ammo Converter. So... I'm lucky those things don't bother me. They have been noted by the devs, and they will be addressed hopefully sooner rather than later.
---
The game is better after the patch than it was before, and it was free. In regards to everything else, people need to learn how to [properly write their constructive criticism](https://personalexcellence.co/blog/constructive-criticism/) to yield the best results - suggest solutions rather than just complaining about the problems, you know? And also be sure to use the [Official Fallout 76 Feedback Form](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42223/~/where-can-i-provide-feedback-for-fallout-76%3F) to ensure it isn't lost in the noise. The feedback forms are [checked thoroughly](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj64mr/i_just_walked_up_here/fwkru23/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) as well.
---
Right after perk loadouts.
---
How can i be part of the problem. I dont work at the company 🤣
---
Yep. You got the points. Except you leveled up like 30 times in those two days
---
Then there’s players like me just hanging out in private grinding legos and queens alone lol😂
---
its killing me.. my build is fucked rn
---
I'm honestly curious as to thoughts of the the various loud apologists of this game, be it the assurance that Wastelanders would fix and/or greatly improve everything, that we'd have free atoms to buy whatever we wanted so quit complaining about costs, or any of the other misguided attempts to sugarcoat Bethesda's foray into f2p madness (with an upfront cost no less).
---
Wastelanders made old bugs worse for quite a few of us. While the storyline was great, it was very brief content, followed up with a tremendous grind on top of the existing grind. Oh and even more artificially low caps.
---
Update 19 was even worse.  More and worse bugs despite being devoted to bug fixing!
---
Update 20 has been... sad. More grind on top of the existing grind upon grind, now with much less atoms with mostly bland rewards in their place. Ammo converter...
---
I just don't see much hope left at this point. Wastelanders was their chance to prove the naysayers wrong and justify the initial cost of the game. But it's just a hollow mockery of Fallout and not much else.
---
Oh you have a lake bed...lucky.  Me, I have to live inside a radioactive fissure.  Then, I have to get up at 3 am, go work 16 hours at the mill, and then when I get home, my father plays nothing but Fasnacht music all night
---
It's janky AF, and people all ready exploited to 100.
---
Because idiotic consumers that just eat up whatever gets thrown at them instead of having standards are what let Bethesda keep putting out content that is objectively bad.
---
That's probably because it's a skin for armour rather than the ghillie suit as an outfit as you get in NW. So it's not something that can just be worn.
---
I'm sure the higher health build guys will see this more than the bloodied or sneak builds
---
Ok I messaged you but I don’t want to be like item whorring so you really don’t have to do that for me
---
Heavy guns are too AP expensive to be used in vats.
---
The trailer insinuates we'll be doing something with the base over the summer. Suppose we'll just wait and see how it goes over the be next 10 weeks.
---
How are people still playing this game?
---
Why are we idiots if we enjoy it? Lol
---
It's not "bugging them", it's "spamming the subreddit". Subtle difference. Go spam the official forums if you want an official response.
---
most people are too assed about ammo UIs and score to give a shit..
---
I personally haven't had a problem with this... 
---
But you didn't expect Bethesda to update something and not break it did you? /s
---
It’s not really another grind, you just get score instead of atoms.  Same daily’s and weeklys
---
Sorry :(
---
I've acclimated to the shift and sadly do play some f2p mobile games (mostly non-anime gacha like Star Wars) and have been a moderate spender from time to time.
---
But the market shift towards an always on always paying model is just gross. At least when I was giving Blizzard $13/month for WoW, there was something to do at all times. Lots of something.
---
lol right.. like they are going to be liberally rolling out 2X XP weekends like the past..
---
Except that they are. Even in 'most online games' like you claim, there is only one premium currency, constant support for bugs and glitches, genuinely decent customer support. Need I go on? For you I clearly do.
---
My biggest problem is that there's no need to get any of that stuff.  There's nothing to even necessitate the "best" gear in 99% of the map.  I haven't visited Reg since I left that vault, because most of PvE feels like seal clubbing even without it.    
---
Maybe the "complete rebalance" will fix some of those issues and I'll have some reason to actually want SS armor, but for now, the only thing that actually makes me tense in combat is an Assaultron dressed like a sheep.
---
You just proved my point.
---
The only problem I have with the season is I feel it lacks content that actually does something..... other than that I don’t really care it gives me something to do
---
You could say that about literally anything...
---
I think you can. someone pointed out yesterday that flamer fuel is actually the 10mm entry under energy ammo. it's mislabeled.
---
Just completed one of the weekly challenges worth 1000 score and got nothing from it.
---
Before the scrapbox, I kept however much steel, lead, acid, ballistic fiber, and fiber optics (I heart Orbital Strikes), and plastic I could hold. I also had pretty high numbers of screws, springs, and aluminum for repairs but would bulk them out and sell them if my hoarding started to get out of control. For your junk junk, honestly 20 is usually plenty. I can't ever remember a time I was like "man! I really needed that 100 gold scrap I dumped and now I'm shit out of luck!" 
---
Wood, glass, cement... That crap adds up fast. And it's plentiful in world so there's no reason to hoard it.
---
How the hell did you kill ten legendaries in half an hour? I can barely find one in that time frame.
---
I think i saw a post claiming that there is a typo in the conventer. 10mm ammo is actually fuel. If i remember correctly there is 2 places with 10mm and one of them is fuel. Have not tested this myself.
---
I had that happen last night(XB1), but they eventually did give me the Score. Like it didn't give it to me when I first completed it, but after I completed another thing, it finally processed all of it at once.
---
Damn. I really want the glowing skeleton too. I have never played NW though. How many games do I need to AFK in the bushes to get 14000 overseer points?
---
I have never experienced half the stuff you guys complain about and ive been playn since launch, not to say they dont happen but maybe not as frequently as you suggest. Also theres only one premium currency in 76. Lol you cant pay real money for Bullion, scrip, or caps
---
Really? That's such good news. I was supremely frustrated after placing it and putting down a ton of ammo only to see no fuel option.
---
Nobody gets banned.
---
But yes it was a duper!
---
Check out the other dude that is on Xbox.  PC here so can't help there
---
Fair point but like its a whole new thing for everyone not just the players if you want to be noticed bitch to bethedsa not reddit users because they might do something abt it.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Someone else pointed that out to me also.
---
You can get it. The halloween and christmas challenges are also available.
---
Each of the dailies I did was 250, except one that was worth 500, so that's 1250 on just the dailies. I did 3 weekly and that was 3k, so that shouldve put me at 4125. I stopped 100 points in to 6, and I maybe earned 2 or 3 of those 100 point ones, so lets say 4425 from the challenges.
---
I earned 1.7k ish maybe from doing public events, it seems? somewhere around there. I did a couple of them, four or five, maybe. 
---
idk I'm bad at maths. 
---
I agree, I feel like earning EXP in both NW and in adventure should give you a small bit of score by itself, though to be fair there is a challenge that you can repeat over and over that earns you 100 score, but I feel like they need to drop that down from 10k to 5k, maybe less.  Or increase the earn from 100 SCORE to 500 SCORE. make it worth your while.
---
Yes please
---
Sweet now I actually have a reason to play nw
---
Oh I’m on pc too maybe we can trade in the future. I have legacy’s and “special” items on there. Not so much luck on Xbox Tho lol
---
I thought it seemed better with my guass rifle also, was I imagining things?
---
PS4 checking in....
---
Oh shit, that explains why I had more spring in my jump earlier. I thought it was just another update bug
---
Also seems you have to get out of power armor to use it everytime because it makes your screen crouch and then clip into the stand that the actual screen is on and you can’t see anything.... I’m baffled that this made it live
---
Yes, even though the game told you no initially.
---
It's pretty intuitive.
---
I see your pipe rifle and raise you a stalkers melee weapon AND ghoul slayers gamma gun!
---
Yeah I agree.this patch has definitely been great for making events more active though which has been fun but hopefully it's not too far for the new colossal problem event
---
Don't claim them until you have space for more.
---
Just taking a look and I have no assassin’s sentinel. Sorry.
---
Be warned, the auto completion on challenges was not fixed. So make sure you log into adventure mode before playing NW, and make sure to not play NW during the challenge reset.
---
My ign is prunesey if you wanna friend me
---
What makes you think they care about us
---
It’s just the thoughtful FO76 community. I drop plans off to people all the time, especially newer players because someone did that for me. Their help and kindness made me love the game now I try to pay it forward. Also, after a certain point plans just take up too much space. I sell them for like 5-10 caps in my vendor each and still I have too many. Any who, please enjoy and feel free to pay it forward. (Okay, sometimes it’s literally just dupers but the other way sounds better and either way you’re safe!)
---
How are you able to get that high I know mutations and you can get it to 15 I think I have mine at like 20 or so. I'm going to guess armor mods and legendary effects.
---
I have 17 intelligence in total 11 at base stat + 6 from egg head - 1 from scaly skin(Actually says I only have 15 for some reason)
---
No need to apologize at all dude I really appreciate that you even offered to look for me :) you made my day a little better
---
I believe that mostly the point I was trying to make.  What they're releasing isn't really core game content.  Wastelanders was content.  Hopefully the upcoming BoS questlines will be content.  What is being released now are repetitive activities to reward collectors with collections of....stuff. That does little for the RP side of the RPG, which to me is the only reason to play this game, because PvP isn't a real core component of the gameplay.
---
It pretty much a single star...good fun gun but 2 and 3 ain't doing alot for you.
---
It actually failed because it was advertised as another mode people could freely explore in, but in reality was mode built to kill other players. With this people began requesting changes to suit they're needs in order to help them survive longer. The mode to begin with already had a lot of problems and later a damage cap was added, which kinda killed the mode in general. A damage cap shouldn't be the same for all weapons, it needs to based on a weapons fire rate.
---
So just load into normal fallout and don’t play when it resets? It was weird because it doesn’t show I get xp for the challenges but I got the Xmas gifts and the Halloween skin but it shows I have 0 xp for everything
---
Way, way more than you probably want to.
---
People have had problems with ESO in the past, but that has been fixed for a long time. I haven't heard any issues with steam for 76 though
---
Hahah, everyone there understands I’m sure!
---
Have an upvote for a good laugh
---
WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE?!?
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
There are fallout 1st players that have armour skins though
---
Not necessarily. Probably someone who opened a ton of presents. I've had hundreds of thousands of them and didn't dupe any myself. Been payed with them several times too.
---
I just don't like battle passes tbh. Bad way to motivate a player to play/spend money.
---
Specially since I was locked out of my daily score due to a glitch they not only didn't patch like they said they did, they made it worse!
---
Wym 40? Isn’t 15 the max amount of points you can have for a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. category?
---
That happen to me yesterday. I fast travel to buy something and came back and tried again and i was able to remove the items.
---
Well that’s why I made this post, for Bethesda to see, right? Is there somewhere else?
---
People are super active but I think they should add more events, fix the bug so I actually get score for doing events
---
I think it just got a nerf in recent patch, if you just crafted yours.
---
You seem to not understanding they want the grind to be a pain
---
These post I've been saying lately have made me not want to pick up the game again after not playing it for a year. I may just go to ESO instead if the has really evolved into this.
---
Yeah.  Got that crap the other day.  Ghoul slayers FFR and vats something.  Just tried to ignore the fact that it was in my inventory until I could scrip it the next day.
---
Yeah, I tried completing some other challenges like the collect 10,000 XP one, and it only gave me the S.C.O.R.E. for that challenge, not the ones that didn't give me anything.
---
If I do receive the S.C.O.R.E. at some point, I'll be sure to update this post with extra information.
---
Yeah also more is broken. As far as stability and quality of life the game is slightly better now than release. As far as bugs and game mechanics being just completely broken it is much worse now.
---
OK. Don't shoot the messenger here. 😂 Have you logged off and on because that sometimes helps. Also, adding stairs to one foundation might allow you to remove one foundation then remove stairs then remove other foundation. Yes, it's stupid. I sympathize.
---
And this: 
---
As Bethesda's senior vice president of global marketing and communications Pete Hines told USGamer, "I think we were a little surprised how few people wanted to take part in PvP and how many more they were interested in PvE together. As opposed to, 'I want to test my mettle against you and let's get into a duel.' There's some folks who do, don't get me wrong, but I think it's a smaller percentage of our player base than we thought," Hines said.
---
How many do they take?
---
I have one of my 4 characters as a Bloodied shotgun. I have used and collected most all QE and BE that exist. My BE DBL hits 1500 at max, while my Bloodied gauss hits over 2400. The secret is to jump shot Vats and use third person mode. It will fire very quick. All 3 shotgun perks and Enforcer, along with anything else that increases damage.
---
You think Ra-Ra is annoying? Just wait until you meet Pita.
---
It's interesting because when I, a level 430+, decide to do Uranium Fever and see it's all other levels like mine there (let's say 200+), we work together, signal each other to the legendary, etc. It's almost always some sweaty sub 100 who clearly just got his first explosive handmade rushing to take out the supervisors. Why would I give a shit about a guaranteed bad legendary anyway when I've got a stash full of legacies? I'm just there for the junk to stuff my scrapbox with.
---
Yup. This killed it for me.  I'm out.
---
2 modules per minigun!
---
Yep.  B on xbox.
---
Sorry, forgot the source.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-was-surprised-how-uninterested-players-were-in-fallout-76s-pvp/
---
Yes.. but you said they need two?
---
Nothing aggravates me more than someone saying something I might otherwise agree with, but the tone and childishness of how they say it makes me just F-O.
---
Just lost. I lost 40 scrip this morning bc I wasnt thinking straight
---
They said it's 150 atoms to purchase one rank, and the option to do this will unlock two weeks after seasons started.
---
Maybe just badly coded then, so doesn't get categorised the same way.
---
I was wondering why you were asking why you were asking since I had already said.
---
I've noticed this after playing other games of smaller game companies. 
---
Less money, less employees. Same product.
---
Actually some of those other games are better. 
---
I'm really tired of Bethesda's crap
---
I've got an explosive flamer I am looking to get rid of and a few LD lmgs and Miniguns.
---
You’re a lifesaver. Logging out did the trick. Thanks!
---
Thank you, I was just wondering about the XBOX
---
always doubt the first math post, especially if theres any whiff of outrage. its probably, always wrong
---
The challenges are active again, but hidden. The only ones that show up for me are the ones for the ghillie suit on my alt since I never did any NW on it.
---
Mine definitely seems to be missing a LOT more than normal. Like 4 or 5 95% chances in a row.
---
Destiny did season progression right, rank 30 and you had your big reward, anything past that was for bragging rights and end game progression. This allowed those who play only once a week to still get the goods without feeling forgotten or mistreated, and everyone else who was going for the max lv cap and put in 40hrs a week could. It also didnt hard lock you out of progression after an hr of play. 
---
My suggestion to fix fo76 progression issue would be to give more repeatable score rewards, make it doable for casual players to finish in 6 weeks and for those who really grind hard to get rewards for going above and beyond, maybe 20 atom for every level over 100?
---
Ugh, I'm so dumb. I forgot I had ammosmith and super duper still on from crafting ammo. With bloody mess and enforcer its packing much more power.
---
They do break the game. But I do love my legacies. A bloodied vats laser crit will kill you with 500 hp, I speak from experience. I’m also a junkie heavy gunner
---
Yup, I was scrolling through to see if I could make fusion cores or such and noticed 10mm under energy ammo for some reason. Decided to make some just to see what was going on and got fuel
---
That’s because the update is not providing any new content. Just more stuff to grind out doing the same content.
---
Yep, you're not alone. A bunch of people have mentioned the same thing in this thread and others. 
---
Hopefully there's an update soon, but if not I'd say post again about it.
---
Ty for the shout out 👍🏻
---
I thought you meant should
---
Update: scorched earth gave SCORE and so did project paradise. I did NOT hit the XP mark for the weekly challenge on either of them. It seems that score is given for “hard” events.
---
Sounds awesome I forgot what exactly I have but I have some pictures on my phone of what they were but idk how to send em to you
---
You’ll lose it. Don’t claim the reward until you have space.
---
Having this issue on Xbox right now :/
---
Edit: However I logged out and logged back in and it was fixed along with my workshop stuff still being there!
---
I did just craft it today, do you know if it can get the instigating perk? As that seems to be my best option for more power since I hate bloodied or junkies bulds.
---
preferably as an actual weapon, but the chances of that are slim
---
It is, but you can raise the stats with legendary effects. Unyielding armor gives you an additional +3 to everything but endurance per piece, so if you have a full set that's another 15 INT. Some underarmor linings and mutations also raise INT, and some foods give you temporary buffs.
---
That's okay. I accept Venmo.  Acct number is 223762
---
I share Inspirational, especially in an event group with low level players. 
---
It boosts XP a lot and some of the aforementioned perks listed here were ones I'd do but others do them. So I give everyone a decent XP boost, especially with the way the season works.
---
Right now I'm playing without focusing specifically on challenges, to see what it's like. They seem pretty simple and easy, but the need to log in frequently will be a problem for me.
---
Okay they were 99 percent originated in a display case. I mean are we gonna play dumb forever and just say what it is.  Punishing dupers or people who trade in duped good is extremely low on the to do list.  If people are still opening them now they are prolly not from xmas.
---
HA! No. 
---
I've got about 60 different plans in my vendor and not one present plan. And i've got about 40-50 more i don't have room for. I capture a lot of workshops. And when you capture and retake a workshop you get plans. Lots of plans.
---
I know. It doesn’t hurt in asking. I think it’d be a great alternative to the Combat Rifle and Handmade Rifle.
---
A lot of folks have mentioned this, I would expect some kind of compensation.
---
Oh wait what I don’t have Venmo and I don’t have any cash sorry mate
---
The SBQ dropped some for me
---
Disco Elysium was made by a handful of people and it's the best game I've played in many years. Bethesda is a *massive* company that has the financial potential to really do anything you could do and the only games of theirs that aren't lazy piles of bug-ridden shit are developed by other teams. It would be less annoying if there wasn't so much potential and legacy lore tied to it, but because of that, it's something that makes me compelled to bitch and moan on reddit all day. The pieces are all there, they outright refuse to put them together.
---
or, alternatively, the developers keep messing up every other week so there's plenty to complain about.
---
personally I don't want to stop playing. doesn't mean I don't want the glaring, game-breaking bugs fixed, either.
---
He mention the drinks and that an xmas present giveaway.  I'm sure they were mount plans, PA plans, and santa crashes galore.
---
Well said. I enjoy the new season. I’m doing events I’ve never done before and I’m level 132. I just did Monster Mash for the first time it was a blast.
---
Yikes. A warning would be nice
---
And I'm guessing all the bug fixes didnt go through because the TPS report had no cover sheet?
---
No problem! 😊 I'm so glad it worked. I've been there!😂
---
Nuke Mines were fixed in Update 20.
---
FOMO is a \*
---
and also very profitable
---
If the idea of the game is to throw every player back to dinosaur age like a real after nuclear aftermath. Congrats to you Bethesda, you have done it!
---
But as players of the new age, with little time available on the game, you are just asking for down votes and bad reviews to discourage new revenue for you.
---
We have no time to slowly click one by one on the action screen to make the ammo exchange. Remember that.
---
I tried for 2 minutes and said "fark it". Left it in my camp for display. It is a farked up implementation w/o considering user experience.
---
I enjoyed this game and the community here. But the dumb mechanism of the game is really "OMG".
---
I am sad, this game could be better in overall experience
---
Maybe? We just don’t know, just like you don’t know. Still could be a bug it’s not active.
---
Excellent info and I feel I have a good idea of what to look for when I venture forth.  Thanks!
---
Oh, that's probably true. 🤔
---
Oh sorry mate! 
---
Better luck trying to find a decent weapon in the future.  I'm off to fuck my girlfriend now.
---
The ghillie suit paint should have been a single item that applied to all armors. But then again, this is the company that sells paint jobs that only work on a single weapon type.
---
Either bug or it’s a way to test them out before buying them
---
I admire their generosity if that happened to me, but it always kinda sucks if it’s on a character I’m not sure I’ll keep long term and might delete in a week or two.
---
After two days of grinding out dailies and the weekly challenges, I'm sitting at level 13. Given the amount of score you get for dailies, you may get 1 to 2 levels a day. Then when weeklies roll around again, you can earn about 5 to 7 more levels. 
---
So, on the optimistic side, you may earn 19 to 20 levels a week. At that rate, you could easily finish the challenges in roughly 5 weeks (assuming the amount of xp doesn't skyrocket further down the line).
---
But, if I remember correctly, the amount of xp needed increases every couple of levels. If this is the case, at best, you would need all 10 weeks to earn all the rewards. At worst case scenario, you'd need to spend atoms to get the last few.
---
Loollll YES THIS IS MY BOI RIGHT HERE
---
I tried to add a porch to my house and the middle of three pieces was higher and blocking the door lol. Guess I would have to rebuild to have a porch 😢
---
I get score from completing events. I just got 500 for killing a queen
---
Same here, this entire game is new ground for fallout. I've really enjoyed the additions this year.
---
Clearly everyone is in on the conspiracy and the game is running just *fine*. Everyone complaining just wants to make bethesda look bad and it's not because there are issues. 
---
The worst thing people can do is keep quiet about these issues, nothing will ever change. If you don't like a post? don't read it. Ignore it. Real simple huh? I know, it's way out there.
---
I love you BBY!
---
Love ya too man
---
Oh boy, this again...you do realize that some people actually like this, right? I couldn't give a flying fuck about any of these camp items, but I don't make a post saying everything that's not a weapon skin is useless padding that should be removed. I know people here will complain about anything, but damn. As difficult as it might be to imagine in a pampered world, you aren't the only one playing this game
---
Its not an assumption from them. It is a plot to make you do it every day so that they can show peope how popular the game is with daily xxx players.
---
I can't agree more.
---
Lately i've seen a lot of people around here defending bethesda (for no reason).
---
Fallout 1st was the start, now they are reducing the amount of atoms we get for free (80% reduction), while they introduce stupid grind to everything in the game.
---
I don't know if what they do is going to maintain many players for long, the number one problem for any MMO is the burnout through the same daily tasks, and all there is for fo76 are daily tasks.
---
And btw to all the defenders out there, "seasons" is just a big skin, to reduce the amount of free atoms so we can't afford and we have to pay bigger amounts with real money, most of the rewards suck.
---
Fallout 76 is a language all its own. You'll pick up on it as you go. Anytime you don't understand something ask a question. It can't hurt.
---
Shame they don't have cross save so i could play across both consoles.
---
Well said. I walked from one corner of the map to the  next today with perceptibobble on just hunting bobbleheads instead of my usual 3queens, imposter westek run and it was fun, I decided to use a walking cane too so it was more challenging. Point being, if it's getting boring do something else.
---
Just to ask are you wearing the chem weight reduction backpack?
---
I just did that the other day! It was a lot more fun than I expected.
---
I think it's kind of a no brainer really. Nothing else allows you to go over the limits these rewards would be no different.
---
Is that seriously your PC IGN? I'm adding you tomorrow if it is, I like ya.
---
I am...?
---
I cheesed the absolute shit out of Encrypted when it first dropped, I mean hours upon hours of server hopping to hit events back to back to back. Got everything **but** that stupid plan. Gave up hope of ever getting one and moved on with my life.
---
Had the opportunity to do a trade bundle for a rare Fasnacht mask recently and Fixer plan was part of it, so I happily did the deal. Yay, done, finally got the stupid plan after maybe 100 tries.
---
Guess what dropped for me when I did Encrypted today? If you guessed Fixer plan, congrats you get a cookie. Damn game.
---
adrenaline is broken too
---
A lot of down voting comes from people who really don't understand what they're reading and some are just jerks usually.
---

---
Yeah, this sadly is just what broke the camels back. I couldn’t have maxed out anyways probably. I’m a single mom and I work full time so time is limited. It sucks bc I love Fallout lol
---
Lol yeah it is what’s urs?
---
Hit escape key for immediate exit
---
Even the core gameplay content they do add is pretty limited. Like, wastelanders was good but it only takes a few hours to finish everything, and then after that the rest of the new content is locked behind not 1, or 2, but 3 separate grinds. I doubt the BoS questline will really be much better in that regard.
---
Plus it just takes them so long to do anything. Months of waiting just for a quest you can finish in a few hours, meanwhile stuff like the atomic shop will get a dozen or so new items every week. I get they have to make money but geez, it's hard to justify paying 5-10$ on some weapon skin for a game that you won't have anything to do in for another few months
---
Pls dun fix it. I am happy to just b able to give ward what he wants when i see him daily. Sick of his excuses of his incompetency in his job.
---
If you're on controller, you can just hold the back button to force close the terminal.
---
But yeah, the entire interface is just bad. I feel bad for those on PC, where it's harder to just spam a button.
---
I would hardly call it diminishing returns. Yes, on the short sighted side of it, it may look like diminished returns due to each point only adding 1% more damage per point added. But let's face it, at rank 1, you are getting a measly 36% damage increase, when you could be getting 60%. That's where it really pays off.
---
I’m on Xbox, is there an equivalent to escape?
---
I think if you hold b or whatever the exit button is it you can instantly get out of it
---
Hold b
---
Yea I agree but its kinda weak still being able to claim it just in case you whoopsies
---
I having the same issue too, seems like stealth might be a little bugged right now too, seems like sometimes they search for me then I go back to hidden I'm even going to danger sometimes in west tek when enemies are out of sight and far away.
---
Ah I’m will definitely do this thanks
---
I can't be mad about not getting my money's worth anymore since they gave me that canvas bag
---
I'm not even sure why the goal is daily login when the atom shop only gets updated weekly
---
Aluminum and Lead are the only mats that weigh less when bulked, so i recommend you bulk them up. But be aware that they will become low priority, so if you need to use them for something, the game will use loose scrap, junk items that contain them, and mod boxes before it goes for the bulk scrap, so take it out of the stash when needed if you have junk decoration that may get destroyed
---
Same as my reddit.  I'm on at weird times though.
---
When they say "Fixed a bug" I imagine the devs on their offices: "SIKE !"
---
they just says drinks and materials.
---
What are you talking about? I don't see any cosmetics? I thought they were just free spaces on the board?
---
Well Eh it’s whatever dude I’m sure we’ll cross paths I’ll friend you later. Imma let you go you have a lady in need
---
I don’t even know how the higher levels do it because the weapons don’t get more powerful after 50. I had to fight two scorchbeasts looking for paladin taggerty and I figured a mini gun would do something agains a level 50 but nope. I’m level 58.
---
well
---
Rank 8 here, not doing the NW challenges. Looking for a legendary to kill, but no events have popped for the last 2 hours :).
---
Why did people think a low tier reward, something they give you before a wood armor skin even, was going to be godmachine of some sort. Personally I don't even understand anyone even picks up ammo they don't use and nobody buys. I can attest from experience... You can drop those 6k .44 rounds on the ground and forget about them. I promise the sun will still come up in the morning.
---
Level 12
---
Hate to break it to ya, buddy...
---
Really cool.
---
imagine PvPing in this game lmao. thats your problem bud.
---
the game was rigged from the start, even before legacies were legacy.
---
Nope. Emotes are all ya need.
---
I fucking KNOW right
---
Finally, someone with the guts to just be a casual and not grind
---
I don’t often try to, but i’ve recently taken part in stuff like monster mash and the post-queen fights that happen, and it all just feels so pointless and the opposite of creative :(
---
We found him, Bethesda's boot licker, over here!
---
Go away.
---
idk why but ever since the update I have felt super squishy. Legendary king mirelurk killed me faster than it took to stab myself with a stimpack
---
I’m just soooo sick and tired of the whole season thing. Every damn game has it or a version of it and I’m just over it. I’m. Over. It.
---
Rule 8
---
I don’t completely agree but yeah pretty much
---
oh boy
---
Honestly, I love this game. I really love this game. And yeah, a lot of people on this sub complain just for the sake of complaining.
---
But, feedback and criticism is important. Especially after new updates. People making posts about things that have broken, or the bad UI of the ammo terminal isn't a bad thing. It's good feedback that (for the most part) comes out of their love of the game. They want the game to improve.
---
Sure, we don't need the front page cluttered with 100 posts bitching about the ammo terminal. But, the discussion is necessary.
---
adrenaline is broken.. fucking sucks
---
if they had they would gave nerfed bloodied builds
---
Anti armor would be better for stuff you can't one shot, I believe it comes in third for dps legendsry effects, and you don't have to play your character differently
---
You earn xp for adventure in nuclear winter, it's not point for point but I still leveled my character up today while trying to do the Nw daily
---
?
---
i tried. someone joined. then left. I then messaged them and explained why i was in a building team. No reply.
---
Doesn't make it okay. MTX aren't good.
---
Some of them are awarding the points early, so at he 3/5 stage for example
---
I am fucking her just like she is you right now since the two of us never got a chance to meet up.
---
Ever heard of junkies?
---
no
---
I have seen mine go up while just sitting in a chair so I assume if a team member kills something, you get a share of the experience.
---
That’s kinda suss
---
The big problem is PTS is for indie studios. Bethesda is a AAA studio. I'm born and raised on the other side of the bridge of silicon valley, which was the hub of game development in the 90s. A common job in our area was videogame testing, for sony, sega, nintendo, 3DO, these were are big local companies, it was an 8 month on 4 month off gig, no testing during the winter season. The crazy shit they would have you do in games to see if you can break them. So when I hear PTS I laugh, bethesda should have a team of dedicated testers who direct back and forth feedback with the developers like every other AAA game studio does. The company is just one big scam.
---
As if junkies does anywhere near bloodied damage. It's not even close.
---
True true. As a full health Vang user, I salute you.
---
haha...
---
Happened to me too. Just gonna be like this until word gets out ig :(
---
Get out of PA, when I got out of my PA I was able to access no issue
---
Yup public team is great, I don't have friend that play fo76 on pc, so this is really2 a huge help
---
A shitload!
---
Yes, it involves frogs. But I can't tell you about it because then I'd have to... oh look a squirrel.
---
It would take a long time to explain.
---
the best guns in the game are currently being duped so the bottom is gonna fallout (get it) of that market.
---
Still find it too much honestly I don’t or sometimes can’t log in every single day and play for 2hours.. but I’m realistic and would prob end up buying the rank I’m missing at the end of the season
---
PS4 Red Rocket Mega Stop not showing as resource. I can claim the workshop but can’t fast travel back to it. Bug or glitch? Haven’t tried restarting. It never happened before
---
Just tested it. You don’t get shared xp from kills. Only from events. If a team member completes a quest, even if you’re not around them, you get a portion of xp.
---
There’s a 30% per shot difference if you run junkies at low HP but you’d just run bloodied at that point. Full health junkies still pops the queen for and easy 400-500 a shot with adrenaline and you don’t die 😂 Also there’s plenty of broken weapons that function well above their intended performance that melt anything.
---
Cool thanks
---
Imagine Candy Crush or Farmville in Fallout
---
You guys keep complaining for the most mundane shit and let all the real shit slide.
---
WHY DOES THIS GAME DROP TO 40-50 FPS ON A TOP TIER GAMING PC?
---
WHY DOES THIS GAME STILL NOT HAVE TEXT CHAT AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF
---
WHY DO THEY KEEP DESIGNING CONTENT THAT GETS STEAMROLLED BY PEOPLE WITH OP GEAR
---
I have 1 charisma I cant share anything that I run
---
Scorchbeasts.
---
I definitely turned in my fuel seems odd that you couldn't buy it
---
🤔 isn’t the score system account wide? Would it be better to lvl up fresh each seasons or do weekly on 2 characters 
---
I’m curious if it account wide because I rather just focus on weekly on 2-3 characters then do daily
---
I would assume there is some kind of warning that tells you that you do not have enough space and won't receive the full award - similar to vendors and scrip machines and if there isn't maybe they need to look at adding that in.
---
Yea i used to able to one-shot most mobs, now two shot minimum which defeats the purpose. My old fashioned pump does the job too.
---
This. You got the points earlier.
---
Im not saying theyre good, im saying that regardless of hlw we feel thts the direction games are going
---
I never said they weren't duped..I said the person who opened them wasn't necessarily a duper.
---
Bingo!! Summed it right up. It’s no coincidence that the grind is so unforgiving and that ranks are even being sold in the first place.
---
Guess that's what you get for cheaaatiiinnnnggg
---
Unless youre doing quests as a team, then use Building while doing the quests, take a chat break while you rebuild your bonds in the Roleplaying team Before you do turn ins. Each point of CHA gives +5% XP and +5% Caps reward for group quest rewards
---
I love how this rifle looks, they just fucked up the animation.

&gt;level 6Dee\_Dubya\_IV BrotherhoodOriginal Poster2 points · 1 hour agoIt’s not about effort, it’s about the available SCORE per day. What I’m saying is, if I do not play for one day, the available 1000 score I could have earned is no longer available for me to earn unless I 100,000 XP the next day. If I don’t do dailies for 3 days, those three days of easy effort dailies then has to be made up through 300,000 XP. Does that make sense? It’s not about effort, it’s about playing it at your leisure rather than feeling forced to log on everyday to make sure you don’t fall behind.
---
I'd suggest finding a new game to play... sounds like you don't like it &amp; or just want everything handed to you.
---
&gt; Simply put, I don't think life works that way, and games reflect life.
---
look man i get what youre saying, you think people should be able to unlock things then show them off because they had more time to unlock them. but honestly games arent meant to be a reflection of life, like all forms of media theyre meant as an escape. if i have to treat a game like i treat my life, then the game has failed at being a game.  i agree with your timegating opinion, timegating shit is stupid and just a kick in the face to anyone whose looking to have fun with their free time. i say just throw all the things you couldnt unlock into a "bag" that randomizes the items and the only way to get an item out of it is to accumulate xp over time, it would be great for everyone. the sweats can have their time of feeling special for a month or two and the other players can feel good when they get what they wanted a month later.
---
I crafted a bunch but haven’t had an instigating yet. My fav so far is Quad and two-shot. Junkies is great too.
---
Would be great yeah
---
Everything and Nothing
---
so they still dupe weapons. great I thought they had it under control by now. And ofc I am aware that stuff has changed I just wonder what has changes that is not easy to notice but still important
---
This is all from memory so numbers may be off by 1 to 200, give or take.
---
And I never said he was either.
---
Anybody else also encountering 'learning' already learned mods from scrapping armor? Did they break that too?
---
in what way broken
---
I have 13 base stat, egg head mutation +6, full set of unyielding armor +15, shielded casual underarmor +3 and lastly with the new grouping system (which works even if you are only one in group) +1-4 and with that herd mentality mutation +2 = 40-43 Int depending on group size.
---
I doubt it will be fixed soon they dont really patch out things quickly I mean look at god mode glitch that lasted since the release of the game and they barely patched it out
---
I agree. I'm wasting 5 points in Agility right now. It feels like an insult.
---
Rank 12.
---
absolute worst part so far was NW
---
well can you give me some essential things that changed
---
I have 13 base stat, egg head mutation +6, full set of unyielding armor +15, shielded casual underarmor +3 and lastly with the new grouping system (which works even if you are only one in group) +1-4 and with that herd mentality mutation +2 = 40-43 Int depending on group size. And i could get it even higher with chems/food, and investing 2 more points to base int.
---
Doing just that worked fine for me yesterday. I was able to return to the main menu.
---
Bats are quite smaller in real life, too. So.
---
Dude, watch CaptaiNoob's video where he soloes the Colossus with like five different builds. This encounter is not fun. It's tedious, frustrating, and unfair, so it's kind of a perfect fit for this game.
---
you could say that about nearly everything
---
Good thing i only trust the moth.
---
Nope I just left him there
---
There are 6 locations it can spawn at.
---
Long press B
---
Thanks !
---
No, you purchased the canvas bag, and they tried to substitute a cheap ass nylon one for it after the fact.  
---
I still think back to the launch of this game as literally the red warning light telling me to stay away.. maybe mothman really is my spirit animal...
---
I love how the model looks, they just fucked up the animations and mods.
---
There's bloodied people out there doing 25k hits to the queen. I've not seen any junkies come close to that. 
---
but yeah.
---
Nerf bloodied.
---
That's good. It happens a lot with perks.
---
I agree with you, yea the converter could be better but there's already so many ways to get ammo like the armco ammunition machine,munitions factory, and enemies plus if you go to lucky hole mine every now and then for lead in excavator armor you'll have lead for days!
---
Sorry.  Got a text from my super model girlfriend and didn't realize it was you.
---
... why would I base my opinion on videos of a guy solo'ing what is clearly meant to be a group fight? I've *played* the event multiple times in the PTS. It's fun.
---
Well the Legendary drop is very improved, they didn’t even mention or acknowledge it.
---
Wait whaaaaa? 😯
---
Lol yeah I bet
---
Interesting! I didn’t think about that one.
---
We've got taste. Yikes, that profile pic ...
---
Sorry, I didn't really mean to single you out. This has been the norm for this subreddit since day one. Almost every patch day since, the subreddit gets spammed for one reason or another. Has there ever been a response? Maybe a handful of times. I doubt we get one this time. The last big spam day, we got no response, but the problem was fixed within 24 hours. They know about the ammo converter.
---
Probably because no one can get it until August and will likely be a disappointment like the ammo converter
---
The converter must be worse on pc cuz on xbox I do my first conversation then just mash A takes 2 secs dont understand the fuss
---
The gun’s definitely still buggy. It’s sad to see Bethesda  nerf a weapon that took so long to attain without also fixing the bugs.
---
If you holster your weapon, that’ll fix the issue with it locking up. It isn’t ideal, but it works for me.
---
As for the accuracy, I believe the issue has to do with the initial accuracy in VATS. If your first reading is 1%, then that’s your hit chance. It doesn’t matter if you stay in VATS and get close enough to be at 95%, your chance of landing the shot is still 1%.  A high Perception and 3* Concentrated Fire helps with this issue, but again, I wish they just corrected the bug.
---
That being said, the gun is still very powerful. I’ve read before that an uncharged shot does 50% damage. This, with the fact that all pellets land in VATS, and you can still one-shot all but an handful of enemies and from a ludicrous distance for a shotgun.
---
Oof too much, too hard for my small brain.
---
I didnt think it was that bad 😒
---
You’re exactly right. I didn’t get into it in my post, but Bethesda has grown substantially even since fallout 4 but we have not seen a proportionate increase in quality of game. If anything, they’re jumping on quick flash-in-the-pan titles like Youngblood and these ps4 timed-exclusive titles while the main franchises sit collecting dust on the shelves (with the exception of doom eternal, which looks and runs great but obviously iD has a bit of autonomy). When was the last time we heard a word about starfield or ES6?
---
I'm happy that you dont' have to deal with this annoyance, but it's not working fine for me today. I redownloaded the Bethesda.net launcher and reinstalled the game through it just to test if that would fix it.
---
Hey quick question what is in your video feed working?
---
&gt; Why are we surprised that people doing paid work for free aren’t producing the quality of paid workers? 
---
I'm going to stop you right there! If the bugreports on the PTS are nearly as detailed as the bug reports we get here on reddit they're probably more detailed than Bethesda's internal reports when the CMs relay a message to the devs. The main issue here is though that they let the PTS only test the upcoming patch for a very short time and don't give a damn about bugreports. Best option would be for Bethesda to open a 'direct channel' where some of the biggest modders/bug reporters could directly talk with the devs working on code snippet A for bug report B and tell them how to fix issue C as some modders might by now have more experience with this engine than the rookie devs in Austin.
---
Just name the point at which you have a dumbass messaging a dumbass and I'm there.
---
same here bro
---
I mean how did they even screw up such a simple concept.... You put in X amount of ammo -&gt; get Y amount of points -&gt; use that point to get the desired type of ammo... It's that simple....
---
Yep, same here. It's always been slow, and it's definitely gotten slower in the past couple weeks, and in the last couple days it's gotten just ridiculous.  It feels like the game is about to freeze or crash every time I craft a food item.
---
Most of the content added by this studio has multiple oversights, and you can really see it come out the longer this game is out.  Something needs to change
---
This is how it was when they first announced season. People were looking for the worst and accusing them that they were going charge for seasons. People just want to find the worse possible outcome that isn’t even there half the time.
---
No I don’t want everything handed to me. I don’t understand what’s so hard to understand? What I’m saying is, if I have to grind 200 hours to complete this pass, that’s fine, I will. But I’d like to do it when I can. Instead of them saying, “here’s 100 tiers, it takes 200 hours, do it however you want” they say, “here’s 100 tiers that takes 200 hours to complete, but you have to do it when we say you can”. It’s the limitation of the score cap per day and week that make it a slog since it’s the only way to rank up. What’s so difficult to understand? They made the pass this way to incentive people to spend real money to complete it.
---
one of the Season rewards is a chicken coop
---
Can't wait for loadouts lol
---
I’m tired of giving them suggestions just for them to ignore them or charge for them
---
What the hell is that?!
---
One legendary SB every three minutes?
---
They took away something they were giving us for free to give is other things for free.
---
Omg sameeee
---
Probably not
---
Bro
---
Ditto
---
It will generate fertilizer just like the currently available fertilizer producer albeit a different skin. How can you be disappointment by something that literally gives you shit?
---
But yes, nobody is going to have this reward for awhile, so nothing really to talk about.
---
Yea that the point the people that completed the daily and weekly were very small percentage of the playerbase (according to them) this new system is more engaging and has more rewards
---
Not fun when you have 32 glowing meat to cook. Thinking to sell them without cooking them: less caps but it is so time consuming otherwise
---
It's random. I got him twice in a day without even trying to get him. Also tried for hours and hours back when the game came out.
---
Time was 20 minutes ago.
---
What?
---
“Suck it up” is not a solution. When they don’t deliver, we have a right to complain, although nothing is ever done.
---
You probably get more from this than you did vs the old system.
---
The biggest clue this would be a slow arse grind, we all should have picked up on was the "You can pay 150 atoms to advance a level..." Its not going to get better. The grind is the enticement to fork out money/atoms. Its also probably why many of the better rewards come later
---
Day 1, but that's because warframe has a similar system and I burned myself out on that one as well.
---
I haven't ran a solo since last year or later.  Is there a quicker path than the intended one?
---
Whoosh. I was making lighthearted fun of it while gently critiquing the padding. If you want a Ghilli skin for your kitchen knife that's not by business. As difficult as it might be to imagine in a pampered world, you aren't the only one playing this game 
---
&gt; As difficult as it might be to imagine in a pampered world, you aren't the only one playing this game 
---
Irony palpable.
---
It's because you use the expression "deadass" that bad things happen to you.
---
Just checking in case you don't know. You can hit right bumper (Not sure about pc) to switch emotes on the in game circle menu.
---
If the guy running away from chickens does not visit our Camp, i will be so disappointed
---
How do you use atoms to buy score?
---
🙁
---
I'm a full blown completionist. Either i'm on full grind mode completing everything or not doing anything at all. With everything we have gotten during wastelanders, and now this score grind... i'm very close to deleting my characters and quitting for good. Too much is too much. And it doesn't help that for every one thing they fix, they break 5.
---
Those kind of numbers are through exploits which Bethesda supposedly fixed. (They didn’t) Bloodied has to be the highest dps build as you get wrecked by anything, even with bolstering sentinel secret service and serendipity you still die very easy at 20%. I used to run bloodied but I don’t anymore, you do lots of damage but that’s about it. I’m sure you’re one of those with a crappy explosive rifle or heavy gun and a mixed armor set cause those are usually the ones who cry about “bloodied” builds lol. Talk to players who have endgame gear of all types and they will say bloodied is fine where it’s at. As far as exploiting for tens of thousands of damage, the devs are aware they just can’t fix the problem.
---
It should work like treasury notes and bullion. Vendoring legendaries and doing events should give an intermediary resource with a large cap that can be traded for tokens with a daily cap that the vendor accepts.
---
Same. Except for the messaging part. 
---
I'll just keep starting them until people figure it out. Changing perks as they come and go. *sigh*
---
I really hope they add a way to quick change perk cards soon.
---
I'd check mods if you have any, mines working a ok.
---
Yea but I think the point is unless you play every day to complete dailies you can’t get to level 100. Grinding it out is one thing, but having to log on every day is another. They need more ways to earn points other than challenges that if you miss a day or two you can’t complete. They do have the repeatable XP bonus but it’s only 100 point for every 10,000 XP. Maybe every 50 kills earns points or something that you can constantly do while playing normally, like they stated. The other thing people don’t want is to log on, complete the challenges in 20 minutes and log off. It becomes a chore at that point.
---
Unfortunately I can only share a rank 1 card..  so it normally a wack one on perception.. I hope people don’t start requesting Pacific cards
---
The problem is when you miss a day work playing because you are with your family and now your behind and have to spend 450 atoms to get to lvl 100
---
If scrip was unlimited I would play 21 hrs a day re rolling legendaries.
---
Goodnight buddy!!
---
Ha that made my day lol
---
I used the ammo I converted to shoot mine.
---
Goodnight bro
---
I think it was a vault with 99 women and 1 man
---
What have they done with fallout 76 makes you think they care about you?
---
Maybe its because we have been waiting a year and a half for an end game, wastelanders was a start and thats all I can say
---
20 minutes to do all the dailies huh.
---

---
Ah, but now we don't!
---
An endless grind awaits, with easy payments to get past those difficult levels!
---
good thing i made this post and not you, then :)
---
Did you switch platform? Like from Bethesda Launcher to Steam or the other way around.
---
You suffer from FOMO.  If you can get out of that mindset, you'll have as much clarity as the people at the Palace of the Winding Path thought they had.  
---
Seriously, don't stress about not having a fancy power armor paint job.
---
I'll take em
---
Better than nothing then
---
Wow. You people and your mindset on this. It’s been out for one fucking day. Just fucking play the game for a bit and see how you progress before bitching that you can’t complete the fucking season. 
---
Or go fucking play a different game that doesn’t make you bitch like a cry baby in reddit.
---
completely not working broken..
---
Yes and no; of course you're going to earn a lot from the season pass, but the idea is that you're eventually going to pay for it. This one's free for the moment, but it isn't going to be afterwards. More then that, you aren't just given a blank amount of atoms. You're given specific rewards, so you are not allowed to chase a specific item you might want from the store as opposed to what you were able to do beforehand.
---
I'm only been on ps4, ps4 4 life all I did was update the bitch
---
I have never had to go and retrieve anything for Ward so i didn't even really know what this quest was. Every time i visit Ward each day and speak to him, he straight away says i have his missing equipment and i complete the quest.
---
When i log in I always see Davenport first, go take photos at Crater and do whatever the daily Crater mission is, then go to Foundation and Ward lets me complete the equipment quest straight away and then sell him him the photos.
---
I liked yesterday today but today was slow. Multiple servers only one SBQ fight, one encryptoid that failed possibly due to sabotage and arktos that went seemingly all day.
---
Yes. I do this myself. Since it's easier to level lowbies than a lv 500+.
---
Strugglsum times in the life of a gamer
---
The fact is you won't, but idk anyways tbh
---
Theres this little known game called minecraft
---
That’s crazy. I’m level 3 rn there’s no chance I get to the end of the board lol
---
Thank you for this.
---
I only wanted the fireplace door, but as I only have time to play 3-4 times a week I allready have given up on this. So for me, myself and I the grind is too much and too heavily depended on dailies. If they fix the event rewards, so that they give SCORE, then mayby it is doable for me.
---
Paging u/LadyDevann to see if you can help.
---
Maybe less.
---
I've looted some from random containers and explosive containers.
---
Losen*
---
You are right on some points but here is what would have to be done to say Bethesda is gross.  If they sold scrip or some sort of pack system for legendary weapons for cash.   
---
This season is free.  All other seasons in games have 2 tiers.  You have to pay for the season to be eligible for the top tier rewards.  And paying doesn’t mean you get to level 100.  You have to grind.  Just take a few breathes.  Have you received fair entertainment value for what you paid for the game?  It’s a business.  If you want to see disgusting practice look at EA.  It’s legal gambling.  Buying packs for a lottery for a good player.  Hundreds can be spent to get one player.
---
I would rather still be getting atoms to buy what I chose than accepting what they decide to give me...
---
Pretty much sums up every Fallout 76 update since launch.
---
I’ve played for maybe 5-6 hours total so far and I’m at level 9. Missed some dailies last night and all but one weekly completed. I will say reading the posts about how missing dailies makes it impossible to reach 100 is a downer but I also agree with you that we should see where we are at in a week or two. I just know I can’t play every day so if the math adds up I can’t finish the board and it is disappointing. The repeatable XP challenger is nice, hit that 3 times so far. They should throw others in too, maybe 100 points every 50 kills or something along those lines
---
Can you imagine how mad people would have been had this been an atom point item.
---
tis a drag.. but adrenaline being broken bothers me way more
---
Yeah I'm not looking forward to nw anymore, the ghillie suit worked cause you either had camo or armor now it can be both, fuck that and fuck this game now
---
Is it an animated thing with real live chickens running around inside?
---
WAIT THEY CANT? Thank fuck
---
It's been in the game files before the collectron was added but no it's not in game. There's a mod to replace the fasnacht beret with it, but that's it. You'd be surprised on how many items are in the files but not actually added in game.
---
Not really a grind imo since it cap daily and most of them you earn while playing but that just how I feel
---
Same. Actually, all animations such as crafting, scrapping, harvesting, menus, and even fast travel are slow, lagging and freezing since the last update for me. Also on PS4.
---
Pretty sure that the season pass being free is a one time deal. I don't think keeping it would hurt anyone. It isn't ultimately going to hurt their bottomline. I don't think that's a good faith thing to say. They could continue to provide both, they're going to make money either way. Particularly with the Steam release.
---
&gt; This one's free for the moment, but it isn't going to be afterwards
---
Already disproven lol
---
&gt; You're given specific rewards, so you are not allowed to chase a specific item you might want from the store as opposed to what you were able to do beforehand.
---
That's a valid argument, but for many people you will still end up in a net positive. If you grinded out every single daily and weekly challenge for the next 10 weeks, you'd be ahead of where you would be from maxing the season by 3000-3500 atoms. That's like...two whole power armor skins. Or two-three camp bundles. Many, I would even dare say most, people will be satisfied with enough of the free items to make up for that and end up a net profit. If not, you're out of luck
---
The collection is wearing the hat so isn’t it technically in the game?
---
Exactly my point, it wasnt removed because people weren't fighting on the server. The pvers went on and turned a server that was dedicated for pvp to cater theyre needs. adding things like the damage cap and the loss of less caps and aid.
---
Was it? I read previous articles that suggested otherwise but, that could be my ignorance and my mistake. I'll apologize if that's the case.
---
To be honest, and I assume I'm the minority here, but the only time I ever followed the challenges before this change was for the tadpole badges. The only daily grind I cared about was events -&gt; notes -&gt; bullion and the rep grind. Anything atom related was for the most part cosmetic that I didn't really care about.
---
So with that in mind, no, I'm not upset. I can understand why other people are, if that's what their daily grind was/is, but it does not apply to me.
---
I love the public teams idea and how they followed through to make it safe for people’s camps. I was insanely excited about the ammo convertor but was vastly disappointed with the actual item. Converted 2,000 rounds of 10mm to less than 300 5.56. I would honestly rather stock my vendor with it for free for lower levels than convert it. On the plus side it’s a nice decoration for my camp. They mostly fixed a lot of bugs with players trapping and grinding, which is awesome. I know that the troll players will always find a way, but making it harder for them to do so is good enough for me. At least they are doing something about it. Unfortunately, even though this was a decent update, it’s still pretty obvious that their grasp for players to open up their wallets is still very much there.
---
They have event team tho for up to 100% event xp
---
Someone posted something about this earlier. 
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjjsyi/psa_score_point_tip/
---
You have made me happy. :) Many thanks.
---
Bethesda really couldn’t think of a character trait for female children other than being annoying this time, ngl
---
I don’t think events give score. I did a bunch tonight and didn’t notice gaining any. I know the last event I did was scorched earth and having already finished the challenges I know where my score points were at and it didn’t increase after the event.
---
I’ve been having trouble with both VATS and normal. Shot at a firefly 3x with VATS at 95%. Each time there was a blood splatter but no damage. Roommate thinks it’s lag. I also have a problem of being point blank to an enemy and registering 0% chance of melee hit in VATS.
---
Swiped at several mole people in Uranium fever outside of VATS with a mole miner gauntlet. They’d grunt and blood would fly but still no damage. It’s making events like Radiation Rumble hard to do when I can’t kill anything that I’m hitting.
---
I’m not sure what would cause the animations and SFX to happen but no hit registered but it has happened way more often after update 20.
---
Yep.  I read that they updated the spawn chance for the Colossus to spawn though.  The patch notes said it was a flat 10% chance to spawn if you nuke the spots it's supposed to spawn.
---
And more confirmation makes me happier. :) Many thanks as well.
---
It's Q for PC and no it's missing, not in the atomic shop emote tab either
---
That's totally fair, and I respect that. It's a bit much, and I didn't always keep on top of it. It was a fair way to respect the consumers-- As much as the developers of 76 have been prior to this point; the game has had countless issues that if you speak of any criticism in subreddit, people are quick to act in defense of Bethanyesda.
---
Lol. Did I ever say you were wrong? Kids. ❤😂🤣
---
Yessss. I'm tired of getting missiles and T-51b legs.
---
I have full secret service and a junkies gauss shotgun lol
---
And despite not doing anywhere near bloodied numbers i think junkies is overpowered.
---
Stevie wonder can see bloodied is broken AF. "endgame" is easy enough as it is without bloodied (and junkies)
---
👍
---
But they said future passes will be free as well, my guess is they might add extra rewards for Fallout 1st owners, or add premium rewards for a price.
---
It is broken for everyone.  It doesn't work at all, no matter what rank it is.  You should probably just replace that card with some other Agility cards for the time being.
---
How much time do you have to put in, and how many days in a row must you play to accomplish this grind?  So say you miss a few days.  How’s that margin looking now?
---
Did they add VATS to Minecraft?
---
;)
---
FO1st member here and I’ll be honest, the promises that Bethesda made never bothered me that much when they weren’t fulfilled. I got FO1st for the scrapbox and constantly use it as when I play with a group I usually volunteer to repair everyone’s items, private servers are nice when you’re grinding for items  but it’s really annoying when you’re doing events such as Encrypted, Project Paradise, or Guided Meditation that generally require more than one person. 
---
That being said, I do find it upsetting that as a FO1st member we hardly get any new items especially since they frequently update the atomic shop with items to be bought. It’s rather frustrating now since atoms aren’t easy to come by if you’re a higher leveled player who’s completed most of the character challenges.
---
In the end though I’m fine with waiting for bigger things, I don’t really care about the cosmetics. The scrapbox has been the best thing about FO1st and it’s going to keep me with it. (Not to mention that the survival tent is pretty useful!)
---
I'm just in it for the glow in the dark wallpaper. Don't care much about any of the other rewards. Bunch of skins I'll never use.
---
It takes you that long to lvl up once? I can lvl multiple times in that amount of time and I’m 220~
---
Possibly they meant completing events rewarded XP which adds to the repeatable XP challenge therefore adding to SCORE.
---
I want to say that I vaguely remember them mentioning events giving SCORE a while back but not sure if it’s the Mandela Effect.
---
Same. Although when they finally update wvw, I will be back for a bit.
---
Did you lose the extra legendary effects as well?
---
Because everyone is losing their mind over math equations.
---
Noticed the console still works but the instruments didn’t today. 🙃
---
We do this so that we can spread the love. Also because we're overencumbered. (But mostly to share the love, in my experience.)
---
And no, you're not going to get banned. You have to pick up x amount to get flagged and that's well under the amount that they would find suspicious, honey.
---
Still no way to sustainably get atoms. Why not make each daily give +5 atoms and weeklies +10. Doing the daily and weekly challenges was my main form of getting atoms and now there is no way to sustainably achieve them.
---
This isn't going to happen.
---
Look at what happened with the reputation grind.
---
Nothing.

---
Yeah, I see that now. It was previously that I read (as well as my best friend who remembered seeing that as well) -- It's a good change. So that's my bad and that's my mistake.
---
yeah I just had to use the personal terminal. atleast I'm in my base though :)
---
I've died from cave crickets way more than Deathclaws. Whenever I see those little bastards coming at me I go "Oh fuck".
---
I remember being able to actually have faction battles with other players.
---
I’ve gone in a couple of bass based including my own with no problem just now.
---
It’s day 2 of seasons and I’m already at level 10 close to 11. The challenges aren’t hard and don’t take that long to complete (especially if you pay attention to the events on the map Ex: Leader of the pack- 3 guaranteed legendaries)
---
There are ways to tank against some of these weapons. I understand your frustration, though. But why remove what people grinded to get and punish them?
---
Fissure hopping and server hopping
---
For me I've noticed ever since patch 19 the barriers will be bugged for certain players on certain servers
---
I use a full set of lv5 unyielding wood armor set for doing this :) And a bloodied weapon to match. Used it already before the score system for those atom challenges since my main is too high level for quick levups.
---
I tried every single string instrument, wondering instrument,  cooking fire, and piano, and nothing worked until inused the terminal
---
Yeah I hear you. Hopefully with public teams helping people to actually complete the more complex quests we can get some more creative end game content aside from just throwing different bullet sponges at us. But for now I will certainly take killing anything other than the SBQ for the millionth time lol.
---
I'm missing it too.
---
I haven't been able to see mine either (on PS4). Also, its amazing that the free weekly item is included in the bundle.
---
Probably because it's the 69th time it's been posted
---
Yes I only have two effects on those three now
---
You don't have to do it. You said you liked to login and do your own thing...you don't need to access new content to do a single thing you listed you enjoyed doing. Hell you'll even get more shit by doing it. You'll get more stuff doing your own thing now, than you would have before.
---
&gt;literally gives you shit?
---
I needed that laugh
---
Ye i get you. I like to change up my camp often and my last 1 I did I wanted to try do an Enclave theme. There are no flags with there logo nor anything that could resemble them in anyway.
---
Pretty sure it's less padding and more being thematic and consistent with the armor skins. It'll be a bit if, for example, one moment you get a ghille armor skin and the next moment you're getting a pink hearts armor skin.
---
Though what does Ghille armor have to do with a space-themed season pass, is beyond me...
---
What is the gold star section?
---
Is “deadass” a “term”? I thought it was a typo!
---
They added some new atom reward challenges if you don’t know already. Ofc you get less atoms but I could care less really It’s just cosmetics.
---
We need double SCORE for the following 9 weeks.
---
Did you have a bass placed that stopped working or were you unable to place one today?
---
Is it  in good condition. The more it's broken the less carry weight you will have and the less ore you will get.
---
My ex got this on release. Before we broke up. Only played a bit. I got the game and now we play almost every day together.
---
Nothing in this game is as bad as posters say it is. People just love to cry about things. Hell I even do it.  So just have fun
---
I didn't see that in patch notes? Is there a source?
---
Lol
---
I'm only at 7 and it's annoying. Not only is it things I wouldn't normally do, it's tedious. 'Plant 10 crops'; what kind of player with an established camp doesn't have enough crops already?
---
at some point youre just grabbing at straws
---
Pause
---
I have a bass placed, I have had one for about two weeks now and its been just fine until I tried going in my camp today, and I've been trying to make a new entrance underground to get in my camp, nothing worked until the personal terminal
---
As usual, there's still a lot of bugs. There was one point in the last mission where the dialogue is supposed to start automatically. It didn't, I tried initiating the dialogue but got stuck with options that didn't do anything. Just server hopped and it was "fixed". It's still signifiacntly better than it was at the start at least.
---
This is why you can’t be nice, at all, to these little nerd freaks who have their identity tied up in the game. Anything less than straight veneration is like a grevious personal insult to their ego and they get triggered and bitchy.
---
I’ve only ever noticed it give me 5%, I figured the lovers embrace was just a different name for well rested.
---
You just hold down the shoot button like an assaultron head.
---
Under what category is the Holiday Tree?
---
Yeah, every piece is over 100% durability, and when mining, I'm starting with at least 100 pounds of open carry space.
---
Once they added legendary modules. This should’ve been done. I grind for gold. Buy modules and role for the effects I want. But for the gauss minigun, you can only trade in 3 that you got a bad role on. Aaaaannnd were done. Better luck tomorrow. Now I’m way over weight and can’t even play again till tomorrow. Then tomorrow it starts again. They are pretty much stopping me from playing their game.
---
Never knew this but good to know. Mine generally has always stayed in good condition somehow
---
Some of us only have 1 charisma...
---
That stinks hopefully it is just a fluke
---
Honestly this is the first time I'm actually engaging with other players in game. So far, I'm enjoying it for the most part.
---
Yeah, I could've existed happily without Wastelanders and Patch 20, to be quite honest.
---
The torso is what collects more ore. I have an ultracite PA with EX torso that gives me the bonus.
---
Is it really punishing that they wouldn’t be able to use them in pvp? On xbox i’m pretty sure they just straight up deleted almost all of the legacies in circulation, based on other conversations i’ve seen on here. I’m just saying they shouldn’t damage players. It’s either A) Make them unable to damage players, B) Delete them or C) Leave completely broken weapons in the game as is? Idk how option C is even an option but that’s the current state
---
My three friends and I have all had issues receiving SCORE from completing weeklies - specifically the gather supplies and build up a camp. Anyone else having this issue? We play on PS4.
---
And YOU get my underrated comment of the day upvote lol.
---
because this community would rather add broken content then fix the current problems
---
Being upset about doing reasonable damage in a PvE game is interesting for lack of better words. This is Bethesda’s attempt at a fallout MMO RPG. The queen is the first boss and after two years people can kill her easily. Most MMOs add harder content and bosses as players progress which I am fine with. There will always be better perks and effects that’s just how games work. Bloodied and junkies are currently the best both having a detriment to character well being for damage bonus. You can still melt with other effects but one will always be the best. Getting a 40% damage boost to be at 20% HP is unreasonable but 80% at the same HP is acceptable. The numbers your talking about are through exploits I can kill the queen in about the same speed with a junkies or bloodied handmade. I would be open to discussion on adding perks to benefit full HP builds as there are for low HP obviously not as beneficial but it would shake the craze for bloodied.
---
Other than getting out of it jumping servers and then getting back in that's the only other thing I myself can think of.
---
It worked for me. Idk what to say about your claim.
---
i didnt get 1000 score for building up camp either.
---
They mean legendary run as in diarrhea...cause it's pretty shitty lmao!
---
You get 2000 atoms from the pass, 1500 from single rewards 500 at the end bundle, and thats if you do the whole thing. Over 10 weeks of old challenges you could get around 4500 atoms if you did every challenge I think. (Like 100 for weekly challenges every week and like 50 for dailies everyday, 100 x 10 = 1000, 50 x 70 = 3500.)
---
And text chat.
---
I’ll upvote, Happy cakes 🎂 day!
---
Nice catch that was supposed to be a the
---
Man, me too. I was punching the A button, cashing in .38 ammo and I thought "this isn't so bad." A few minutes later I menued through to cash it in and I came out with a whopping 24  .45 rounds. Great.
---
People on this sub wanna hate the game they love, it’s a weird dynamic but hey humans are strange and complex.
---
This season is not a grind at all IF you care enough to even want the stuff in the pass.
---
And as you say, the people who care enough to wanna actually complete it all are usually the ones putting atleast 1-2 hours in a day, which is enough to do your dailies (from experience) and the weeklies would come too with that time... I mean I done the weeklys in a day too, probably maximum of 5-6 hours but i’m sure you could take 2 hours off that for just messing around etc.
---
Thanks!
---
Waste of ammo.
---
I didnt get 1000 SCORE for building up my base weekly.
---
I was talking about new stuff though. I made a couple posts right after update 20
---
Idk it is a space travel based board. Space travel is very slow even with advanced tech. Lol :p
---
40mm grenade rounds...it's like they knew no one will use these, let's troll them Bethesda thought lol!!!
---
Lmao
---
It was a weather control station before the war so hopefully we can repair that system
---
Yes, this is true but people are never gonna stop shooting her because of the damage threshold that you must hit to get loot.  I've come to just accept it as the norm.
---
It was 10 percent with a name similar or the same as the enlighment of mothman
---
Never seen 10% for sleeping. It's just a different name and it lasts longer.
---
Yes I have noticed a serious problem with enemies health rubber banding, especially when I use my short handmade which has a fast fire rate. Crazy that this is still such a problem.
---
i know right why sit here and “bethesda plz” your whole fuckin life before you realize they havent even looked at 1 of these bethesda plz posts
---
Dude.. you are a legend.  I did not know that at lvl 358.
---
It's always 5% but different times. I think max is 3 hours.
---
What’s a budget lol
---
Huh, strange mechanic for a boss.
---
Yea. I've been reading that. Just putting this out here as that will mess up the math the OP did. So it'll take a little longer to complete.
---
Hey, I've been thinking about what you said about my weapon having an inherent Damage boost. I was wondering what you think I should use for that Damage boost, assuming you're talking about legendaries. If not, please elaborate. 
---
Also, if you have any advice on what weapon I SHOULD use, please let me know!👍
---
All I know is I just play the game for fun..... and I’m collecting these points. I’m not really going out of my way to do side missions. I ranked to level 5 in about 25 minutes giving me the ammunition converter which I think is an awesome perk to have!!
---
Maybe in your part of the world, but in my shithole country we just call it math.
---
they need to bump up gold bullion to 250 per day
---
Ok the point of it is to sell seasons this could have been done on just about anything but to sell it they needed or felt like it was necessary to create something unique for it aka make us something that will help sell it if they put it with the tinker bench when they already showed something that would add more fuel to the fire
---
I started playing GW2 at launch and played for about 4 years.  It was a great game.  I became frustrated with the daily grind, multiple currencies, and the Raid which at the time was inaccessible to a portion of the player base.  Engi was my main, though I had maxed out all the classes at one point.
---
Do people saying "I finished all the dailies and weeklies and am level 10, it's fine" realize the required season EXP increases every level?
---
I thought the same thing. Heard all the complaints and then I got it. Ended up scrapping it instantly. What a waste of a good idea
---
Upvoted for slipping 69 in there.
---
Nothing there contradicts what I said, they are just significantly more optimistic about players ability to complete all challenges and get xp; xp gain is subjective from player to player. Getting the most accurate estimate for time to complete the season should be from focusing less on variables and more on the constant.
---
Fallout 4 settlement modding has spoiled me beyond help. But if I had to say any *category* that needs improvements, it’d either have to be generic raider stuff or Enclave stuff. Give us a mortar skin, but make it look high-tech like what the Enclave would be using.
---
Ya theres no way im grinding and completing every single challenge over the coarse of 10 weeks. I have a job and responsibilities.
---
That is because beneath big foots taint hair is another foot...
---
you know what else is broken dont you?
---
Tbh just join either one. I've had much less people in events or INT teams. You can still play solo and be part of a public squad for the perks. I'm sure we'll all hear how "I didn't get 100 lvls done" yet no one is going public squads!
---
Well it's with a partner at max rep  and was 10 percent instead of 5 that's why it was awesome.
---
The ammo machine from the crater puts out more 45 ammo than that
---
If you want to complete the battle pass it seems you really need to. The OP answered me earlier that his calculations included doing all the nw dailies too (and you still couldn’t finish the battle pass with that. That gives 250 a day. You only get 100 from 10000 xp. So that means you have to do at least 2.5 times the repeating daily daily to make up for it. Very unreasonable).
---
what kind of meat do you usually get?
---
Yeah it's very true and in some servers can be unbearable. If people would just let her land queen runs would go so much faster and everyone, except Meele builds, would save a ton of ammo.
---
Of course but when some are over level 10 on day 2 do people realise they are making a massive deal over something that is "claimed" but hasn't been proven
---
The economy is already f’d ammo wise. I haven’t made ammo in over a year. Gave away all my excavator PAs to others because I don’t need any more lead.
---
Tbh yeah. It's a huge pain to get rid of stuff when you have more than 3 3-star weapons.
---
Thanks for clarifying. Good to know it actually *is* possible to just do the normal challenges. I did find it strange that it would still be short.
---
And yes people upvote any bollocks as an excuse to bash Bethesda. The amount of people around here that defending exploiters *because Bethesda*. Bizarre.
---
but so did many others. Like at one point there were 9 or 10 ammo converter posts in a row. People didn't even have to use the search function as they were right there
---
So in a perfect world, is it percent based, or does she just land at random intervals?
---
News flash: nothing  you mentioned is mandatory.
---
I just want something in the Mire. Not Harper’s or anything. Just the swamp. Only the swamp. That would be fun as fuck.
---
This sub downvoting anything that isn't about how slow progression is on a free system
---
We can stop games from going in that direction by not engaging with it.
---
I mean Ik that stuff ofc. I’m taking about bugs with the bullion system and new power armor issues.
---
I keep two Gourds at Camp for the Relish. Turbi-Fert to re grow them. Stick the Relish and Soups in my Fridges. Sorted.
---
Give it time. It my favorite game and I can’t find another to take its place but I’m really bored playing it even after this update. I looked through all the rewards and the only thing in the 100 stages I would be interested in is the guillie suit for SS armor. That’s it.
---
Morgantown is pretty good but I wish there was a Toxic Valley map for NW. Any new map would be cool though.
---
Probably because others have seen them before. Maybe.
---
That will only delay the inevitable games as a service is becoming a thing whether we like it or not
---
What is this flamer build you speak of? Sounds interesting
---
This is perfect. I think I'll set this up tonight. I've been doing very well leveling up (3 levels per day since yesterday and I'm 386) but why not push it harder.
---
Idk man 🤷‍♂️ It just seems unnecessary for people to get mad at posts
---
As a constructive response I do all non essential atom building at workshops as that shits so fleeting it doesn't matter if I get issues as it'll wipe.
---
My camps too beautiful to mess with.
---
I dunno man. I never play NW, but I went on today, forgot to not join a team, and ended up killing two other people before dying myself. It can be fun. Just gotta get a feel for it. And hope nobody has a Tesla.
---
Nope i like the new seasons. Instead of grinding for weeks for atoms i might spend.  im getting multiple things for free. If I don’t finish the season no big deal. So far 90% of the challenges i do during normal playtime anyways. Plus i don’t think seasons are going to be a constant thing. I feel like they will take a few week break between them and bring normal challenges back.
---
Only thing i want fixed is the ammo converter. 
---
Just add options in the menu to bulk sell ammo instead of 20 rounds at a time and ill be happy.
---
Well then consider yourself lucky up until now to get something bugged going in your favor, cause I have never heard of anyone else having an ally giving 10%. Would much rather have 10% than just longer duration.
---
Hoes mad (x24)
---
I've been using Atom Shop Paints for items I use to prevent myself from accidentally selling them.
---
But right now, there's no paint for the Secret Service Armor, so every time I use a Scrip Machine I peel my eyelids back and triple check every button press I make. Thankfully there is the Gillie skin in the Season stuff but that's gonna take a while to get to.
---
Meanwhile, my Gauss Rifle from the base game STILL hasn't had a skin made for it.
---
That is hilarious, I don’t find many people actually fighting in the game either. I think we all hide except for a select few. I’ll go hide and continue watching Netflix and every so often check in to restart a match. But that’s what they drove us to do. I don’t feel bad at all.
---
I think beth wants us to get bored of and disregard the challenges, that way later on you buy these "limited time" rewards.
---
Yeah. I've been reading conflicting reports. I need to edit to reflect this.
---
Yup. Last night at an ungodly hour i was about to go off and someone launched a nuke and i was like 'why not' There was me and 4 other people. I get there. Queen turns up and nobody shoots. Nobody. We just stand there and then she lands. Everyone goes absolutely HAM! Then she takes off and the shooting stops. And she flies around for 10 seconds maybe. Then lands again. HAM TIME! She takes off. 10 maybe 15 seconds later she's back for some ham. If it took more than 3 minutes i'd be surprised.
---
From triple A cash cow studios charging full retail and loading it with every concivable monetization scheme all the while.
---
You haven’t.
---
I don't like daily leveling, my main character is 200+ , I made a new character just for it. I do like how there's more to do
---
A 20% damage buff to Anti Armor would probably make it close.  Junkies is a viable alternative giving about 20% less damage potential, but greatly improved survivability.  Personally, I'd leave Junkies alone.  As a bloodied player, I'd be fine with some buffs to AA and Vampire's.  Those are both good in their own way, just need a little buff to be on par with Bloodied or Junkies in terms of combat viability.  I think Bethesda is pushing toward this considering they gave a pretty sweet AA FFR .50 cal as a reward for Beckett's quest.  They are probably hoping more players will give AA a try, but it is still somewhat weaker than the meta prefixes.
---
No, this is false. Her actions are random. She will still land (if that is the predetermined action) whether you are pumping rounds into her or not.
---
I heard it not so much that she is staggered but that she won't land when people are in spots where she can't melee them. Such as on top of the bunker, the fence or on a tent.
---
But many people will not play NW, so you have to subtract 250 SCORE every day. 7 x 250 = 1750 a week, 1750 x 10 weeks = 17500 you also need to make up, assuming none of the weeklies ever involve NW. That means grinding the XP repeatable: 17500 / 100 = 175 times. That's 175 x 10,000 XP or 1.75 million XP.
---
Let's back up a bit; so we need 250 SCORE a day to make up for NW. 10,000 XP = 100 SCORE, so 250 SCORE = 25,000 XP you need to earn every day to compensate for not playing NW. Plus you still need the 10,000 XP to keep the pace up to reach the end.
---
I'm only level 58, so grinding out 35,000 XP a day isn't something that comes easily, if at all. I just don't have enough time to play and earn that much XP.
---
;tldr If you're a player who doesn't like NW, you better be ready to grind 35k XP a day to keep pace to reach the end of the season.
---
It's working https://imgur.com/uZS8kiD
---
Sure enough, it is the stats above! The best looking underarmor for the most elite law enforcement agency in the world deserves these stats.
---
Well if it makes you feel better both today and yesterday’s nw challenges were ridiculously wasy
---
42069 points
---
Good one. I’m so insulted.
---
Dang, I don’t think it’s happened to me. That sucks though. Sorry to hear it.
---
Okay thanks bro
---
Just take over Posiden
---
I’ve found you can do both in one day, I think. But rocksy needs to be in the morning for me and Wren is in the evening. I don’t have that much time to put into it. So I just do black eye and then magnolia pavilion and what other encounters I can find to get extra.
---
I mean, that "Community building" thing was news to me. Can't say I'd heard of it before.
---
It also helps if people do not place their survival tents all over especially right in front of V9.. That is if the nuke is placed right where it barely gets fissure prime and the grove..  that's an ideal launch.
---
Just one of many of the math threads -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjf5a4/people\_are\_spreading\_misinformation\_and\_bad\_math/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjf5a4/people_are_spreading_misinformation_and_bad_math/)
---
I'm not waiting 20 minutes just to get 3 and possibly have to do 2 defend events in between.
---
The first few ranks are made to go quickly. With every rank the score requirement increases by 25. In the higher ranks, you'll need over 3000 score per rank. 
---
At rank 12, you've earned about 5-6% of the score necessary to get to rank 100. You **will** have to play and complete your dailies every day to keep up, just because of how the challenges are structured. You can't afford to miss anything.
---
Probably.
---
Well like I said. I'm not attempting to spread misinformation or bad math. Just trynna get an answer from someone smarter than me.
---
Not that particular mission but it consists of 3 separate dailies, lucky mucker, dross toss and chow line that can be done over and over. 
---
If you can get then to trigger.
---
With any luck maybe they’ll turn it into a planet fitness. 
---
Weights absolutely everywhere
---
I’ve made a bloodied guide and a post recently about me beating the SBQ solo, you should check them both out. I included my build in the solo SBQ one.
---
So dont defend ..just go there and take the cores out, and besides you could just farm/server hop.... cant wait 20mins, you need um now?
---
I’m sure they do lurk. It’s just that the things people want that are instant good changes don’t happen while the controversial stuff does like why is there even a debate about text chat? Why isn’t there a better way to shop vendors without randomly fast traveling the whole map? These are just two things that any one who plays notices the game would be better to have and yet were two years in and several currencies and mtxs later
---
It's not that bad at all. We see this every update. There are various groups of people who have kids, work too much, have lives, haven't played in months, too low of a level, too casual, etc etc that want the most from the game but don't want to grind too hard for it. I empathize with many of the arguments. Parent working full time and 76 is their past time and they'd like to get this stuff.
---
But at the end of the day there's going to need to be some distance between you and the goals.
---
The calculations show if you do the daily/weekly/occasion XP stuff you'll be fine. It's an hour a night.
---
Soon everyone on here will settle into the flow and just roll with it. I look forward to seeing some normal posts here but I've lost hope; just so much angst.
---
wait public team stuff isn’t on private servers? that kinda sucks...
---
You’re forgetting about the repeatable. I can complete it approximately 9 times an hour. 
---
It’s not Bethesda’s fault people don’t know how to gain large amounts of XP in a small amount of time.
---
Instead of shutting it down just put all vendor type menus including the pipboy in a terminal type menu if they really want to make their players go insane.
---
Well, they did make a literal, actual camouflage suit and tie. Totally need a ghillie coat and tails.
---
Id use the gatling unless you have a crap ton of 50.cal ammo to use between both
---
X on ps4
---
Just looking for a boatload ASAP
---
Personally, I would like to see more repurposed junk into decor/utility items i.e. beer bottle string lights. But merchandise for all of the various corporations in the Fallout world would be awesome. Nuka Cola everything, toys of all the comic characters, maybe more advert posters of the various foods and drinks, Corvega model cars and trucks, also make the robot models displayable everywhere, not just in cases. More tin signs for stuff like the tortoise cigarettes and cram. More souvenirs of landmarks like the lighthouse souvenirs. Maybe snowglobes could make a comeback? Little knick knacks like that.
---
I’ve got an assassins sentinel urban scout chest piece. With +1 charisma or something useless like that I think. What’s so good about them anyway.
---
Yeah, that's why I linked the thread I found most accurate and reasoned. Didn't choose that one cause of the name to imply you were spreading misinformation. Sorry if that was a misunderstanding.
---
Bro you just got a free bundle
---
I can tell
---
You can't use the armor skins in NW
---
At least you can't with wood armor
---
It is because your Instigating shotgun happens to have the "Magic" effect.  It is a bug.  Allows it to one shot nearly everything in VATS.  Your Gauss probably does not have this effect, and you are probably not wearing any armor piece with the "Less damage while Blocking" effect.  Suppressors is a bad prefix for shotguns.  You want Instigating or Junkies.
---
Shh...We are all on NW because the holiday rewards are live for now.
---
Thanks. The queen gun will use ultracite ammo,  the normal one wont. It is alot of ammo that route.
---
Idek it’s just what the dudes wanting but I recommend you hold onto that they are still good for pvp
---
Crossplay between PS4 and XB1? Yes.
---
Crossplay between consoles and Pc? F*ck no, they can keep their shagged economy and hackers, we don’t need that on consoles.
---
Ya I’ve canceled Fallout First and kept literally every benefit and got my money back.
---
Ghlili power armour when?
---
Upvoted. Cake for days.
---
Well, that doesn’t solve the problem. My character has already completed mistaken identity, and has done those other quests several times. The problem is, it won’t as completing mistaken identity by just completing those.
---
It's crazy how people can play games differently, you know?
---
I was also in the dress test, remember how buggy even the most common things were
---
Things don't get better if you sit idle and let them do whatever they want. We are customers. Would you bitch about people saying their hamburgers sucked from McDonald's? Or expect it, as McDonald's should improve their product if they want to make money? Bethesda isnt owed anything, we are. We bought their product, they need to make sure it was worth the purchase.
---
I've sold and scripted many of my armor sets because I was on my PA while selling and scrapping T_T
---
Occasionally and I mean occasionally they’ll comment but don’t ever expect anything major. If they choose to make a statement in something they do it on inside the vault
---
Nah, bushwookies are just free kills and make endgame super easy. But thats my opinion
---
They do when the need a chuckle... "Oh look, they actually think we add/fix things becuase we want to improve the game... buy more atoms!!!"
---
Lots of these also on ps4 1&amp;3 annoyed me a lot
---
The third person rapid fire lost a bunch of its punch when they patched the Gauss so that you have to charge it to do max damage.  Auto Charge is gone.
---
Hold B on xbox or whatever your back button is and you'll back out completly from any terminal.  Always been a thing.
---
So SCORE is right but i was awarded early?
---
Bunch of cosmetic garbage that you need to grind your ass off for and no actual content like new quests,weapons etc.
---
I saw a few people mentioning that. Maybe I did...
---
I'll keep an eye out.
---
I’m sure they are used to the bush campers. A surprisingly large amount of the nw players don’t actively try to compete.
---
Very good choice.  You will NOT be disappointed with that masterpiece!  A top 5 game of all time in my book.
---
I got the level up daily on an alt character
---
Good for you
---
🙃
---
I like these ideas a lot. Stuff that makes it look like our camps have adapted to the wasteland would be awesome.
---
You can get all prefixes on the Gauss Shotgun.
---
Who the fuck makes these decisions and thinks they're good ideas?  Do they play video games?  Do they know  franchise they're working on?  Did someone call in sick and they got the accountant to design game mechanics?  Seriously how can they consistently come up with shit that is so bad?

My favorite spot is the Airport

---
&gt; Update - May 20, 2020:
---
Since we originally posted this article, we’ve seen questions and concerns from the community about what it will cost to take part in Seasons after the first one. We’d like to clarify that participation in Fallout Seasons will be free for all of our players, and we apologize for any confusion.
---
yeah some are a bit hard
---
I agree.
---
Was double xp maybe affecting it at some point
---
This isn't just a Gauss Shotgun problem. Happens with many weapons.  VATS is borked.
---
It is just more apparent on shotguns in general.
---
Math goes as such.. you wont have enough to complete it just doing the board game, unless your a 1st member and save your monthly atoms.
---
Sir. This is illegal
---
It's really poor design that there's no banking system.  Expecting people to play every day or miss out on rewards is stupid.    
---
They should want everyone to feel like seasons are completable and enjoyable, because this is going to be the majority of day to day content from here on out.  If people think it's either too much if a grind or that they can't accomplish it by playing a regular persons schedule (bulk of gameplay coming on weekends), people will just quit.
---
I mean, you say give it time... but I can also do math...
---
i'll give this a try! didn't know just holding it down was a thing
---
420"69" 
---
Me: niccccce 🙃👍🏻
---
I’m trying to play it to get the even unlocks that are available again. I suck at pvp on this game tho so I feel bad for teammates when I forget to select no fill.
---
Absolutely! Dont get me wrong, I love all the "like-new" lanos and appliances and such, but one thing Iove about Fallout/post apocalyptia in general is that people recycle and repurpose garbage to make new things. That's what gives all of those post apocalyptic settings flavor. We've already got some things that pulled off that aesthetic; the water tire wheel, liberator lamp, etc. I would love to see more stuff like that. Likewise though, I like your idea of the collectibles. There are so many corporations in Fallout lore, the merchandising for those companies could be endless.
---
Do you remember paying for the game?  Because much, **much** better live services exist where you *don’t* need to pay for them period.  
---
Patch “price” doesn’t mean much when the game isn’t even worth what you payed for it.  (In regards to that bit in the last paragraph of comment)
---
I mean, I don’t know what happened man I swear I sent him th memo. I guess I’ll just re-send it.
---
It's maffs, they teach in CHOP.
---
Alotta people have traded alotta Groll gear for legacies i think it would piss off a pretty big chunk of the dedicated playerbase which is fair with how much some players have traded for them
---
Grinding is grinding, whether it's XP or dailies/weeklies. I'd rather enjoy myself instead of playing a grind simulator.
---
That's not the part that's not working for me. It's when I enter "The Legendary Run" from the menu, then try to leave to return to the menu or the game.
---
Found the bethesda bot
---
Than go enjoy yourself and quit bitching.
---
The green dump truck in the parking lot went missing at the same time man. The goul still spawns in the back of it 6 feet in the air. Your just now seeing this?
---
Really? I had no idea that was a thing. Well i fixed my perks (hadn't switched them back after making ammo) so it is one shotting things now. I'll be working on that instigating for sure, knew I wouldnt get it on my first attempt, but bloddied/junkies isnt for me.
---
I've seen them for 100 caps on PS4; they were duped on consoles as well.
---
I said this when the game came out in beta and was destroyed in the reviews. 76 was an experiment in a new style of gaming. Beth was very over ambitious in their project; is this an RPG and MMO solo team FPS. It had an identity crisis. I suspect they were bogged down with tying two engines (ID software with creation) and put way too much resource in patching that sinking ship. This resulted in them most likely taking the position of "we have done market research on what people like so let's launch it and be guided by the community".
---
Of course Bethesda (parent company Zenimax) is a corporation with shareholders and a need to profit. You have the mix of creative minds and money minds trying to hammer out a balance. Sometimes it feels like the money minds are winning.
---
But at the end of the day the franchise will do fine. It's well too established to let one game bring it down. And to the contrary... Here we are huh. Still playing. More joining. It isn't dead. It's not exploding and beating the likes of Fortnite or COD but it's still here. 
---
And like others said, put your energy both positive and negative into something you do love. I really enjoy 76. It's not 3 it's not NV it's not 4. It's its own thing. I enjoy it for what it is and if I didn't I'd play something else.
---
Let's all just find what makes us happy instead of obsessing with what makes us mad.
---
Gotta be the whole set, or at least torso+arms
---
Yeah I play two games with pass systems (MTG Arena and rocket league) both massively more forgiving in terms of time required than this one and I really am not interested in adding another one especially that's so grindy and that has no banking/catch-up so you don't have to play every day.
---
You will be lucky to get 50c+ for the plan now on any platform. It was duped into oblivion.
---
My wife shares strange in numbers while I share inspirational 3*. We normally run on a team together regardless so sharing cards is nothing new for us. We did notice that we were pretty much the only ones doing this though
---
I have seen numerous posts with all different math and working and ultimately they are all based on assumptions not actual proof which is my point
---
Sweet, thanks for the answer.
---
I know the feeling.. random things went missing from stash, so I assumed it was becuase of the vender glitch... but the things that went missing wernt anything of real value.. otherwise they would have taken the Winter man masks and other rareities of the sort.
---
Okay, no problem... For how long?
---
This inspired a side question. Can people edit your camp in a public team?
---
I know they are just trying to make more money on atom purchases but an easy way to help us and still give them a good profit would be to give fallout 1st members a multiplier to the score like x2 score if your a 1st member.
---
Turn Team Fill off and wait in a bush by yourself until I find you and kill you. Problem solved.
---
That's really what I don't understand. You're dead on the money; people will go along with this, many will 'fail' and decide it's not worth their time, and then there will be months of gap between content updates you can finish in a day or two. I'm not sure the game will hold onto the new blood and renewed interest through that.
---
Yeah i saw that the piece I have is worth like max caps but most people don’t even care about PvP so it’s hard to find anyone that wants it. I just switched to a bloodied stealth commando too and I’d love to find someone that would trade me a good bloodied commando weapon for it.
---
Yeah man I really want to like this game but it feels like every good thing they add comes with a bunch of catches that really make me just not want to play
---
No banwave. Only 1 bubblegum now.
---
Your perk category point allocation is just your base Intelligence.  XP gain is calculated using your total Intelligence stat which is shown in the pip boy under Stats/Specials.  
---
With unyielding, intelligence boosting underarmor, berry mentats, mutations and certain foods such as scorchbeast brains or brain fungus soup it is pretty easy to get 40ish total INT.
---
Oh yeah I mean I have some near perfect stuff and he still will only take that. It’s kinda annoying but whatever
---
Do you know if Inspirational works if I'm alone in the team?
---
That's way too grindy. 
---
Lets compare with warframes system. Their season isn't halfway done but if you completed all their tasks you would have already gotten the latest reward.
---
I dont want it bro
---
I'm at 13 major slow down once u do daileys and weeklys
---
Fed76.info is a great tool. It allows you to price check weapons and armor. The price is set for PC so the prices are a bit lower If you’re on console but it gives you a good idea of what to trade in and what to sell here
---
Damn oki thanks
---
Nope you need a new character to complete it
---
&gt; **if you truly care for us** 
---
I'm fully with you in your suggestion, but, really? If they care? You might have individual staff members who care about the game and it's future, but chances are the majority hate us due to the backlashes that make them work more, and a corporation as an entity will never care for you any more than it has to pretend to while parting you from the contents of your wallet.
---
Building stacked foundations or building on a golf course?
---
Tough titties
---
Till youre done
---
Be interesting to have a group of 4 share it
---
longstanding bug, happens from time to time
---
You want any of the secondary perks +33VATS, 50% Limb Damage or Bashing Damage.  The prefix doesn't matter, as long as you get one of those suffixes.  Instigating and Junkies do magic no matter what the suffixes are.
---
On the FAQ, it states were supposed to get SCORE from completing Public Events, so I hope that gets switched on soon
---
I noticed this too I'm guessing it's for balance. I feel like it would encourage bush camping since all(?) armor has a ghille skin now
---
As a single dude I can keep up with this, but I don't want to.  Taking the tasks that you could do for atoms with no pressure and turning it into a situation where you feel compelled to complete them every day even if you don't feel like it sucks.
---
And the mask comes off. Classy.
---
The reload animation works perfect for me.
---
Not sure, but that would be perfect. Someone should know haha, I was wondering that too
---
Forgot to mention, team fill is off.  I'm waiting by myself.
---
you love to see it, thank you very much :)
---
Yea, but warframes equivalent is... well... shit.
---
I mean their current "season" started in mid may and you can already have all of the rewards unlocked by last week nothing else to do for the next few months before the season ends but grind for the extra currency to buy from  the limited selection of expensive junk in the shop.
---
Hey remember panning for gold in the wastelanders trailer?
---
Ah bummer :/ good luck man I wish I could help
---
I can still craft fine
---
Lol ok. 
---
No one is making you play the game. If you don’t enjoy it do something else.
---
Guess I’m never getting my atoms, then. I’m not deleting one of my other level 50 characters for 80 atoms.
---
It takes nearly that just to get into a NW, for it to start up, and then to fulfil the challenge if its a quick one. But nice try.
---
You’ll take it and enjoy it
---
Yeah but we leave a game completely broken to save some peoples’ feelings? Or do we compromise and fix the game, let them use their crazy guns for PVE only and make pvp actually depend on your build, not only your legacy gun? Idk the exact answer i just don’t think letting people rain a hellfire of energy explosive bullets in pvp is the right one.
---
the scavengers do pan for gold in the game, just not the players
---
nah even during 2XP it was still 5%
---
OP either had a bug or is misremembering
---
next time OP...include a screenshot for proof
---
otherwise...no 10% has never existed
---
About 6 months ago
---
Holy crap my first 100 up votes
---
Most of the NW challenges are easy as shit though and can be completed in a single match.  The most difficult one should be raising a rank which can be cheesed by going in on a new character and ranking up in a single game.  Otherwise the challenges are things like taking a few pictures, spamming a few stimpaks, placing your camp a few times or killing some creatures.
---
The fact that it's not only very demanding but also has no weekly banking/catch-up system will just make it essentially a wash for people with lives and families.
---
I dont think u need unless u have i think 200 chars ? If im not mistaken.
---
Oh, how *could* you OP?
---
No one cares that you’re doing that, OP. It’s nothing new.
---
Head of nail meets face of hammer. This is essentially polishing a turd. Here, let's wrap some new rewards around the same tired events that you've been doing for over a year. I have lost all motivation to play this game and am moving on.
---
If I afk I just need to relog
---
They actually do, in a round about way. If the paying customer goes elsewhere then the game shuts down. That's worse for them than the customer. It's in the interest of the company to treat it's customers well. They are the lifeblood.
---
Also THANK YOU for this post for all the woe is me about the machine I found it awesome the mass dump of ammo took some time but now it's just handy AF when you find random left around ammo...
---
There’s a five character limit, sadly.
---
GaaS literally can't exist without players to engage with it. So it's less of a delay and more of a stop.
---
We are all pissing in the wind here if we are trying to persuade bethesda to do anything.
---
I am
---
That's weird, I'm level 30 and definitely didn't do 1500 points of damage but still got loot off of her.
---
No problem! Hope they fix the GUI soon so we can use this comfortably.
---
I've seen this too. My friend and I were at Arktos Pharma doing the event and we also found her inside.
---
Yeah that's why like every other single pass system has a built in feature to let you play a couple days a week rather than every day, because a lot of people either can't play every day or don't want to feel like a game is a job they have to clock into every day wether they want to or not.
---
I make a post going over some of what annoys me but Todd’s batty boys saw it first and killed it lol
---
I've managed level 10 so far with 1 more weekly left, the legendaries ones. I've also decided to not claim the 150 atoms reward cause then I'll have it for down the line for the last few levels if I need them. I'm pretty pleased with my progress so far and it seems pretty manageable particularly with them giving us atoms as rewards throughout it. I read someone saying that you'll get enough atoms to go from level 90-100 if you just bought those levels, which yes, I'd rather not do, but equally, if they're giving those atoms for free then why not save them for that, if I don't need them then I can use them for other stuff. I'm only level 48 and have been playing maybe 2 or 3 weeks so far, and people seem to be complaining an awful lot about something that is for free that you can only benefit from.
---
What im saying is that you cant stop it, everything is becoming subscriptions, netflix, threadbeast, $1 shave club, amazon prime. Gaming companies are going to try their hardest to capitalize on this regardless of if they lose a few players, because frankly at the end of the day most people will still play.
---
I pick it up as i use it in pipe weapons and would use it more if they were better. And less stupid looking.
---
Bethesda is the only company that could turn something really good into absolute trash.
---
For everything they fucked up in this patch, the public teams are pretty good.
---
How about the fact that the ways that do give SCORE right now are BUGGED? I completed 2 weekly score objectives (robot, camp ones) and they did not give me any SCORE. I basically lost 2k score due to a bug related to a major release. How can I justify keep playing when stuff like this happens EVERY SINGLE update?? It's madness!
---
With what?
---
I have never been able to finish that event.xbx
---
No I will keep filing tickets till it gets removed
---
Vats
---
Maybe not enjoy it but they'll take it all the same
---
I mean maybe it’s designed the way so melee characters aren’t just completely shitted on lol
---
It wasn’t a reward from the map, it was a reward from completing the challenge.
---
Yep! Everyone has their opinion. Don’t care for yours. I just like to play!
---
I hated her more, I hate when bethesda puts smug characters that I can't teach a damn lesson, they did so well with nazeem.
---
Harpoon guns are very in right now...
---
Yes, but I am one hitting all non-boss mobs still without charging, and taking chunks of health off the queen still. I expected them to have fixed it completely but this is still great.
---
I liked to play too. Im just saying i dont like the grind
---
Oh jesus christ they just need to stop with those. This like the 3rd one theyve fucked up
---
How do you stack foundations?
---
Repairing a plant is essentially replanting it... as unrealistic as it is to take a piece of fruit and turn it into a fully mature bush it's better than taking the smashed stump of a mutfruit bush and rubbing shit into it until it bursts back to life.
---
Lol yeah idk how I did it but I would’ve rather had the score than the atoms since it would’ve been equal to 150 or whatever it is to level up with atoms
---
I have a QE one, is that any good?
---
It's a glitch. They're apparently fixing it- I wasn't sure if it was still active tbh.
---
You know, a seven day rolling window to complete all (or most) of the challenges, or even just the progression based ones would be nice
---
Just now on xbox.whole server fighting the queen....we failed that event 1st time ever failing it.feel a tad defated
---
Since the new patch, there have been numerous bugs.  This is one of them.  NW is giving out random holiday rewards.
---
Ya me neither honestly. But just playing is good enough! Wasn’t trying to be mean towards you!
---
Funny thing is, i tested with Kovaak's mouse sensitivity matcher and compared it with fallout 4. Fallout 4 has the zoom sensitivity the same regardless of crouching or not. Also, fallout 76 has a bunch of mouse data variability vs fallout 4. Using Kovaak's, you move the same amount of distance regardless in FO4. Meanwhile in FO76, i don't know how they botched the input, but the inputs are always +-what it's supposed to be (sometimes it overshoots or undershoots).
---
Everyone can test this and see the same results:  [https://www.kovaak.com/sensitivity-matcher/](https://www.kovaak.com/sensitivity-matcher/)
---
No one is making you read our bitching. If you don't enjoy it do something else. See, I can be dismissive and unpleasant too.
---
If you KNEW that the game's new content consists of a system encouraging you to do, in your own words, a "menial boring checklist" then by all means you don't have to play the game.
---
I see a common phrase in your wording: "Want to X? You'll have to Y." Uh, no, you don't. You don't have to do anything.
---
I can tell you are not enjoying yourself. So please stop. Find something else to do. I myself have pretty much done everything I've ever wanted to in this game, so I'm outta here until the next Brotherhood of Steel content update. I couldn't care less about the legendary run. I recommend you do the same if you really feel that way.
---
Ah alrighty
---
Christmas In July, obviously.
---
But no they've messed something up again and NW is rewarding things it shouldn't. A lot of the time limited stuff seems to be getting granted randomly.
---
Heh you are right. Wonder if there is a law suite in there or something. Disney is not a company to mess with.
---
Sorry if it came off mean!
---
It's glitched and impending fix right now. I've been getting Halloween themed items lol...
---
This
---
Its alright lol
---
Yeah, pause
---
Yes but it's day 2. We have plenty more days. We're not expecting to go up 10 levels every 2 days, but we're 1/10th of the way there within 2 days, which is decent progress so far. Ultimately, if you don't want to play the season pass then don't, but the way I see it, we've not paid for it, so if we do the challenges and gain levels we are gaining free rewards, whether we reach rank 100 or not we have gained free stuff, which is good. Lots of people seem to be complaining that they're not gonna hit 100, but there's still good stuff on plenty of other levels that will be easier to hit if you can't play much or don't want to grind as much.
---
Wastwlanders had some alright features, but the NPCs really add nothing to the game, you can't really interact with them at all once you finish the very short quest line, and the end of quest grind is 100% a chore that no one enjoys, because there's nothing there to enjoy.  Three fetch quests some nice world building addition which are always appreciated but are generally just window dressing and like 10-12 hours of quest line.  It's not bad but not something I would use as an example of 76 being a game worth playing.
---
Oh I thought I’m behind
---
I felt crazy trying to find out what was going on. Are they going to revoke these? Kinda like the wreath....
---
I can do that. But for how long?
---
Till you're done with it
---
It's not too bad i used a Auto clicker for dumping the mass load just needed half an eye kept on it
---
I literally did like 3 public events and went up 4 levels on the pass lol
---
I'd use number 1 over the others.
---
One of these things is not like the other...
---
So what exactly are you suggesting here?  That building the model for the tumbler is equivalent to creating the system that actually runs the converter?  Or that they should have reassigned whoever on their art team made the tumbler and have them better spend their time figuring out how the converter should work?  Or the argumen that people have literally and seriously made before that in order to get more people working on programming stuff like the converter properly they should let off t he people who had the spare time to make the tumbler look nice?
---
Same here, she was irritating at first, but later helped me get a very nice weapon that I could not have gotten without her.
---
I’m pretty much a complete noob, but it seems to me like there’s like maybe a few thousand players that have it gamed head to toe that pretty much ruin it for me and I’m sure countless others
---
We’ll finish the race as long as we do all the weekly and dailies and the repeatable at least once a day?
---
So that means doing that repeatable 8 times yesterday on the first day already gave me a huge head start then? That’s a relief.
---
Done with what, though?
---
I tried the same but some times it wouldnt "remember" the option I was clicking and ended selling like 500 5mm rounds (the ones that I was actually buying with the points)
---
The issue was for some reason when my monitor would go to sleep it would cause the game to absolutely freak out. Can’t even pull up task manager.
---
Good to know, thnx
---
I'll be honest, it used to annoy me because the average before was about 20-30 player lobbies and now theyre almost always full. You also dont get anything extra from outliving an extra 20+ people than before so the only annoying thing I found was that. It just made it harder to reach placement. 
---
However due to all the noobs players I was able to get quite a few really easy wins (21 wins to be precise) within the past day, helping me unlock the NW Halloween and Xmas stuff. 
---
You guys keep doing you, dont worry about what the older players think
---
Thanks for the info, Ill be sure to look out for those.
---
If I have any that you need, you can have them. Psn is
---
Nked-on-ur-couch
---
If you have a low level Character... Go into NW kill one beast and die you level them up there and in adventure. Build things at a camo takes seconds. You're half way through your challenges in about 10 mins. The chances of a legendary event popping off (they usually run about 8 mins long) is high as you do the others ones. Tag them and you get the kill count. 
---
Maybe I'm over exaggerating for most of those who play. But the dailies do not take that much time if you put a tiny bit of thought into it.
---
I doubt it. They don't revoke atom shop items when you request a refund for something because it's a pain in the ass for them to change it, so I don't see them doing anything about that either.
---
Yeah i bet they do.. Do they listen at all, not really.
---
Wait, they added *VATS* into Minecraft??
---
Alright cool thanks and love the user name lol
---
Then make it so that your monitor doent got to sleep
---
Noticed it too. Ive been blaming lag/servers
---
It's a few steps but easy enough to do. 
---
Place your initial foundation then place 3 foundation ramps in a stair step pattern and you'll be at the next foundation level. From there you can put down the second level of foundations and repeat. 
---
Quick note, the foundations have to be connected to the level below them somehow, the easiest way is to leave the ramps, but I thought that looked ugly so I figured out that if you connect steel stairs it will still count as supported and you can remove the ramps. Oh and if you place steel stairs on a concrete foundation, you can place another foundation over them to hide everything. You'll still see a bit of the handrail, but you can use that to make everything look cleaner.
---
Dog or cat?
---
Would’ve been cool if they would have implemented a “shoots and ladders” element where you can risk it for higher lvl rewards but can lose progress as well.
---
I was kinda hoping that we would get that Red Rocket prefab that was data mined. Been saving my atoms just in case they release it!
---
Chimken
---
They physically dont have the capability to do so.
---
Play for fun, don't be a mouse in a wheel..
---
Got it. Thanks for the help!
---
Thanks captain obvious, I appreciate your wealth of knowledge. Lol like wtf
---
Chimken paws or chimken claws?
---
Pedipalps
---
I think those are illegal.
---
Wow thanks! I'll try it later. Take care dude.
---
Idk it sounds more like a computer problem than a 76 problem
---
Ha ha, yeah.
---
Seems that way. Oh well, just checking. 👍
---
I am at 13.  No NW, ground for XP mostly.  It has been a grind so far.  On a positive note, I will probably gain 200 levels by the end of the season if I want to finish.
---
To leave a team open map then social then go to your game name at the top you will have leave team option there
---
I have literally nothing to do except take care of a dog and play games since I got laid off and I can't do everything.
---
Realism again. Kinda like how you swing a weapon differently if you are in 1st or second person view. Or like how I can repair a pipe in a silo by ... clicking on it ... from stealth ... but I can't hack a terminal stealthed. Oh hey fast travel? Or who am I trying to fast travel??? Or like just stimpacks in general.
---
This isn't about realism. If going to build mode to scrap and replant is what keeps your suspension of disbelief in check more power to you.
---
Mechanically this sucks. Not ammo-converter-suck, but it sucks.
---
Well. There are some cool unlockables that I probably cant even unlock cuz of some selling point
---
Its the sound when somebody finds a nuke briefcase and i dont think there is any option
---
Using mods or custom ini file? I had this issue plus crashing at rusty pick till I removed mods and custom ini.
---
Wouldn’t it be funny if at the last couple of circles, all the actual players who fight are dead and it’s just a bunch of pacifists fighting over bushes for the win.
---
Definitely not a computer problem. My computer is a ufo on userbenchmark meaning I basically have an at home super computer. I’ve had zero issues with any game other than this one. Love how the last of this games fans will justify bugs like this till the servers die.
---
Sure. I haven't seen too many people complaining about how long it actually takes to do the Daily/Weekly challenges though; the issue is being locked into doing them every single day, without fail, because falling behind means you are extremely unlikely to catch up. A week of missed challenges in the final stretch is millions and millions of xp for the repeat, and not really viable, even with a good xp build. At that point your only option is to give up demoralised or spend Atoms. Which is the point of making it how they have. Which is ugly.
---
I think it’s dumb that they haven’t increased it at all even when players have been pleading for it for the past year or so... also not to mention having less legendaries will put less strain on your stash and will likely help server stability, even if just a little bit.
---
And if most people didn't still play, it wouldn't happen.
---
If your camp is being attacked move. I have a very nice spot pretty central to everything, let’s me have acid, water, crops, and very rarely gets attacked by anything. When it does it’s a level 14 mole rat at worst.
---
You must be new here. A few months ago, people complained that there was nothing to do end game. They then add Wastelanders, and then people complained about the grind of Wastelanders. Then they complained that the two factions weren’t deep enough and they were finished quickly with that. Then they add the battle pass and people complain that it’s too much and you can’t get all the rewards. It’s obnoxious. These are core parts of the game play people are complaining about. Constantly. Now, gripes against the ammo converter and such, even though I haven’t used it, seem like another story. 
---
Overall, it’s just annoying seeing complaining every single day. Have a good one!
---
Just like people’s stash randomly disappearing. Probably didn’t affect you but that doesn’t mean it was there hardware causing the bug.
---
Id love to enjoy the 6 I cant find already.
---
Also, "Ward is a Jerk" but maybe more indie goth.
---
your weapons have levels and legendary effects. a level 50 player with level 10 minigun will still do jack.
---
you need something like a max level minigun with effects min/maxed for your Perk build, which will take far longer than level 50.
---
I think this is actually the first Fallout game I've managed to be bored in. I hated 4, but I wasn't bored.
---
Bunch of goons on the block.
---
Used it, but right now most of my characters are in "bloodied overkill mode" and not really missed it much.
---
But I never said it was tho
---
Youre not gonna convince people to not play video games dude 🤣 literally hindreds of thousands of peoplw buy every single CoD that comes out.
---
So bethesda has two options either leave them as is and upset people that don't have legacies or nerf the legacies and upset the people that own them unless they can find some way to balance it without upsetting either which would obviously be the best outcome but that seems unlikely. Honestly I dont understand why people don't just make a group and set rules I understand it can be frustrating to PvP with randoms just to get annihilated but nobody is making you fight them
---
I don’t mind bitching when it’s justified but most of the bitching about seasons isn’t in my opinion. I know it’s hard for all of you to accept that you’ll actually have to play to earn rank but they did announce what was being released so the complaints that it’s another “grind” are just stupid. They never said you’ll be able to earn stuff easily or in the matter of a few days and no one should have expected a simple easy to earn progression after everything else they’ve released so far. 
---
You’ll have to play frequently to achieve rank 100 but you won’t have to play EVERY day. If you can’t play frequently enough or don’t want to play frequently enough that’s not Bethesda’s problem. That’s your problem. If it upsets you that much that you can’t play frequently enough to complete the ranks you have personal issues in my opinion.
---
I hate that I have to wire electricity and now you want to waste budget on plumbing?
---
And in real life radiation would allow a virus to live then work with it to make bats five times bigger than my house.
---
No?
---
 No but you pushed blame away from 76 by trying to insinuate that my hardware is the problem. You know what you’re doing, don’t act ignorant.
---
And it has norhing to do with standing on top of survival tents but the tents themselves not giving her room to land
---
How
---
Well, damn. You learn something new every day.
---
I'm just saying you could just leave ur monitor on
---
Are events actually giving score?  I haven't noticed any.  Some people have said that the Queen fight was sometimes awarding score.  I wish I would get so lucky.
---
And everyone is watching Netflix, so nothing is happening.
---
Lol you’re still doing it just stop.
---
No you can't and it's kind of annoying. Should've been a toggle, not a set thing. Because now you have to leave the party, then leave the public team, and then create a regular group if you want to party to actually build things (which is funny that there's a group for building and you can't actually build) . It's so damn convoluted.
---
I agree i'd rather have a pass you can grind at your own leisure, paid with a free track too. 
---
Although i did quit Destiny a few months ago for good because the grind of bounties to quickly get XP for the battle pass was so damn boring. Everything was boring bounties (kind of similar to these challenges).
---
The grind needs to be reasonable and go up by XP alone. Have these challenges as bonus XP if you want. Let me smash it on the weekends to make up for lack of play during the week.
---
My point about the reload animation is that it is visually broken, you basically float the magazine with your arm to reload and of course the reload functions as a reload my point is they shouldn't charge 5 bucks for something   broken.
---
Good to know.
---
You know, I was wondering the same thing... Worst part is I bought the damn thing and haven’t equipped it to check
---
This seems less bad but even with your numbers, the time drain is insanely hard to approach..I work full time, grinding out dailies/weeklies every single day for ten weeks straight without any room at all for breaks or missteps just isn't practical. I enjoy the game but Beth is just burying all the good stuff in layer after layer of grind and it's starting to be something I can't handle or keep up with
---
What system are you on? I’ve got some doubles of a couple. I know I just picked up an extra Pip-Fall in Sutton. I’ve got about 4 Grognak in the Ruby Ruins. I’m on PS4.
---
Preach!!!
---
That’s a lotta ham
---
So what's the point in this post, I dont see a purpose other than a pointless rant
---
Yes, it was TZMapMarkers. Thanks.
---
I wouldn't even complain if they didnt make it seem like you could earn it legitimately without spending atoms. To bridge the gap you'd have to do the repeatable like 1853 times a day. 129,750, the difference of 227,250 minus 97,500 divided by 70, 10 weeks times 7 days. I mean. How are you supposed to fairly do that. Like its totally unfair for those who think they have a legitimate chance of getting everything free. Unless they have different repeatable challenges the further it goes along. 10,000 points regardless of what you doin can get stretched pretty thin if you're not NO lifing.
---
No mods at all.
---
I think there supposed too. Heard the eagle handmade skin isnt working in nw either. So be hopeful or if someone can correct me.
---
Maybe. GaaS isn't going to be stopped with that attitude, though.
---
A lot of games struggle out of the gate and it takes some time to gain footing. After wastelanders I saw myself thinking in a few years how terrible fo76 was at launch and how amazing it is now.  
---
But the kinda stuff they're doing across the board is too much for me. They've bamboozled me with poor content and false promises for the last time.  One sub canceled doesnt mean much to them but it sure as sh!t felt good to me =) 
---
Counting the days till the new assassins creed.
---
What sucks is someone being so lazy about going out and picking some corn that they want Bethesda to redesign something to suit them.
---
If you can go out and find nine more fertilizer you can fast travel to the forest and pick up some mutfruit to repair your camp.
---
So much projection. That said, at least this time you actually typed out something worth actually reading though and engaged with the topic in a meaningful way. So even if I disagree with you, it's appreciated.
---
Nobody really knows.
---
If I could, I would throw WAY MORE upvotes than just one. It's ridiculous.
---
You're seriously complaining that you got a free item? And on top of that are going to continually complain until it gets removed? God your fucking privileged
---
At level 550 I need roughly 85,000XP to level up. Solo, with no buffs other than \~15 INT &amp; Well Rested, it takes me about half an hour of pure enemy grinding at meaty locations to gain 1 level. I don't loot, I don't tinker with my inventory, just kill after kill. So while it's doable in even shorter time, it's super tedious. Podcasts help though.
---
Is it going to stay forever? My camp is at the edge of a radio station signal and constantly lose and catch it.
---
..keeping in mind that there will be a certain segment of the player base that will simply buy their way to the end after the 2 week start-up..
---
As far as I know it looks new to me. It’s definitely not the Uncle Sam salute
---
So we have to do "bonus" challenges to get the required amount?? Does Bethesda understand that extra credit is supposed to be optional??
---
Wait i thought u meant NW
---
adrenaline being borked sucks
---
Is it under tant or hello?
---
"More loading screens" is not a good game design answer.
---
This is not about lazy. We are both playing an imaginary game for fake digital prizes. This is about how we choose to waste our time.
---
This is what Bethesda thinks the game is like
---
Then stop bitching about having to fix stuff.
---
Can’t have your cake and eat it too.
---
And I’m saying that it works as expected for me, the hand grabs the clip and puts it back in.
---
None of this is mandatory or paid.  It’s free rewards that are optional, not tied to progression.    Beth is just trying to give people things to do and rewards to complete.   If they weren’t there everyone would be complaining there’s no endgame or stuff to do.  You can’t complain about free.  Wastelanders, free...gold system, free...score rewards system, free...Upcoming BOS quest line update, free.   I mean if you don’t like doing it....uh...don’t.
---
But it’s not what I WANT so that’s why it’s bad, the game was obviously made for me and only me
---
Uh.. sucks.. not angry though, they could have done a better job hiding the fact that the want us to buy atoms..  but meh
---
Nope, I hear it during regular adventure mode
---
Yeah idk. I see a lot of people on this sub complain about being bored and losing interest and the second they give players stuff to do for rewards (which is FAR easier than say, the tadpole challenges) I still see a lot of people complain. Me, honestly, I don’t have much to do right now so I’ve just been playing 76. I’m level 200+ now and most of the stuff it gives me to do I usually end up doing anyways, I.e. I complete shit and have no idea what I even did to complete it lmao. I do have my gripes with the game but most of the time I’m just happy enough to play.
---
The instant 100% recovery from 1hko is a bug thats existed since day one - I just finished an Oxhorn stream from launch day and it happened at least once.
---
Its pretty typical for Bethesda to break its games just a little bit more with every patch or bugfix.
---
Edit: don't downvote someone for stating facts. I've got 2.5k hours in Skyrim and just over 2k hours in Fallout 4, and just bought 76 during the Summer Sale.
---
Stating a fact isn't hating.
---
I honestly might just casually do it until almost the last day then buy the rest of the tiers
---
Then it has something to do with the score stuff but i honestly dont know what
---
The devs 100% used console commands to spawn in like a hundred of each ammo type and sat there for like 5 minutes each and said "Wow neat! Not too bad." It's like they couldnt have made a worse system if they tried. The only way it could be worse is if you could only trade in 1 bullet at a time.
---
God Bless you sir
---
Hide in a bush and you'll get the rank in one game. I just went from rank 0 to 3 in one, cos I lasted a while and killed a few NPCs/players with my level 1 with no SPECIAL stats above 1 😅
---
And the Stimpk one from yesterday was easy, too. I think you start with a stimpak, and if you run into the fire you can just spam them from your pipboy. "Expired Stimpaks" count too, I think.
---
You get more points for Survival Time than you do from killing players, killing NPCs, or making it to the top 10. So yeah just sneak around and try and have some fun!
---
If you have unopened Perk packs, opening about 130 of them took me all the way up to like rank 6 or 7. Might be worth saving them for later if you need to get an Overseer Rank again in the future for SCORE points, if you have no intention of playing NW outside of that. Not worth using now though, cos the first rank is sooooo easy to attain!
---
Also, if you get Aquagirl/boy you can hide underwater 😬
---
The other day I dropped off 10 Razorgrain Soups and 30 10mm bullets outside the Vaut.
---
Were you planning to pull all of that fertilizer out of your ass?  Because unless you're filling your stash with what is otherwise literally useless shit you're going to end up fast traveling anyway to grab some when you need it.
---
Pretty sure you’ll level up the first time you ever go on a match
---
I heard it’s 2% bonus XP per Intelligence point, is that true? Would that mean your getting 80%-86% more XP with your setup?
---
If they're done right, they can. I think the best thing they should do is make it so that they aren't limited to a certain time.
---
It happened sometimes, but all the sudden it’s super bad for me now. A good 50-60% of enemies insta recover from my shots like 2 or 3 times now
---
We will just have to agree to disagree on the topic I suppose. In the end I hope you can still find enjoyment from this game or any other game. 
---
In the end games and reddit have no effect on either one of our real world lives. 
---
Regardless of your stance on the game I wish you the best in your endeavors.
---
I've been enjoying the game for months now but I've stopped playing for a couple weeks because I felt like there was nothing to do. I also enjoy nuclear winter, I've only faced hackers with my time in the game mode. I'm back to experience the new stuff, for now. Also, first day back and it looks like there's an exploit to kill people, a dude came up to me with something automatic and explosive and killed me in nearly 3 seconds, pvp was not initiated.
---
It's just zoomers.. if it can't be consumed in a nanosecond they can't comprehend the concept. 
---
Same went for Bullion, now look; no one gives a feck.
---
Just the next thing to moan about for a week. 
---
Personally I've enjoyed it, it's got me thinking about and doing other things.
---
Make sure you go through the correct channels and report this to bethesda including a list of your hardware. This seems like a really weird and isolated instance.
---
Trailers! And shipping containers/ railway cars like we had in fo4
---
For me on ps4 with gauss shotgun it's now worse, unusable as it's so unreliable in vats.
---
Removal probably won't happen - as it would too quickly be abused by Dupers to gain unlimited scrip.
---
For better or worse - a hard limit per day means dupers can't gain any more scrip than someone just grinding.
---
So it can be worse. So what? It does not make it good or even ok just cause it could be worse.
---
Okay, call the hundreds of legitimate complaints and arguments "angst."
---
Also, no? 
---
The issue is not having to fix things, it's the mechanics of the process. Have I not been clear that I think this mechanic is poor?
---
But we all can since we can just buy the tiers. This isn't about giving hardcore players a reward for their time and dedication spent playing. This is about encouraging people to give them money.
---
If you notice it says discussion. Are you getting upset or something because your comment sense is seriously lacking right now.
---
How do the saved perk packs work?, Is it worth opening all of them or should I just skip it? At level 358 I am assuming that I have a lot of them.
---
People just like to complain in general... There are far to many Karens in the world.
---
Who cares? Those people give Bethesda a lot of money which keeps the game afloat with new content for the rest of us who don't spend anything beyond buying the game itself.
---
Hover over your normal "wave" or "hello" emote and you should see an option below the wheel to EXPAND. Its Q on PC not sure what it is on console. Once you hit Q more emotes will slide out and you can choose one!
---
Also... anyone who really likes to just game and have fun is welcome as well!
---
Oh thank fuck
---
Alright, there’s room for improvement (it could just fix the stuff you have the mats for rather than make you get the plant so you can replant it), but it’s not even close to ammo machine bad. If you don’t like losing your crops to mobs, either move or get farmable dirt tiles to put them on the roof.
---
Actually DC would be East.  East (and a little south) of Harper's Ferry to be more precise.  NW and West is Ohio, SW is Kentucky, South/SE is Virginia, East is Maryland and VA, NW and North is Pennsylvania.  When I was stationed at Ft Meade which is near DC, I used to drive home to WV whenever I had leave.  5-7 hours depending on traffic and weather (I grew up on the western side of the state).  Always had to go past Harper's Ferry, then eventually Clarksburg on the way home.
---
I mean i dont think how i or anyone else feels is going to change that. Studios cant compete with other titles if they opt out, especially with tons of them being so successful doing it. My main point though is, you don't really HAVE to pay for any of it.
---
Is this a real question? If you dont have a scrap box the stash holds like 800 pounds .. you store junk right? You don't have a couple dozen fertilizer, seriously?
---
Had the opposite experience when no one shot her.  She just kept fucking back off into the cloud.  Absolutely no one on reddit has any idea how it works.
---
LOL sounds like a good strategy.
---
Took me a bunch of tries.  Basically head to the water north of Grafton and get a low level rad scorpion or mirelurk to kill you in shallow water.  Good luck!
---
I’d help but on XBox.
---
I help low levels all the time, give away free shit, craft them stuff. Ive done many of the events, it has to be hundreds of times at this point and i enjoy them. Ill admit the game has its flaws but what game doesnt.
---
It was never funny. The thing is hot garbage in its current form
---
Aight, imma cry now
---
Well.. look at it this way the people who lose interests are always the bitchy complainy type personalities, the less of them the better. It leaves more awsome people to make friends with. On a side note, those same type of bitchy complainy type personalities are always the troll/griefers
---
You're right and it's the same with leveling up in adventure mode. Start a new character, leave the vault, you are now level 2. Takes less than 5 minutes... Delete the character and repeat the next day.
---
Someone just came to my camp and did this for me- was so very nice and appreciated!
---
I noticed if i slowly click a and wait before i accept to pay caps to fast travel it will work. Rapidly opening the map and smashing a always causes it to bug for me. Have patience.
---
Don’t trust a damn thing anyone posts on here.  No one knows.  I do the queen event enough to see it happen every way described and contrary to any way described.
---
You can get 2000 Atoms. There's 10 nodes with 150 Atoms &amp; 1 final node with 500. Still though, nerf is massive. Seasons last 10 weeks and then there's a 2 week pause between them. 2000 atoms over 12 weeks = 166 Atoms per week.
---
With the old system you would get on average 150 atoms worth of weekly challenges and 50 atoms worth of daily challenges, which equals 500 atoms per 1 week.
---
So even if you'll manage to reach rank 100 in the season you'll still get 3 times less atoms than you would get with the old system in the same time period (2000 Atoms vs 6000). And if you'll stop anywhere before rank 100, say rank 99, you'll end up getting 4 times less atoms than before.
---
It is fine, I appreciate the advice.
---
Haven’t stopped playing NW since reading this.
---
If PC use mod save everything, anything equipped or favorited wont be deleted
---
Say it louder!!!
---
If you're never gonna play NW again don't worry about  Opening part packs. If you have any "Bush like" clothing on the atomic shop use that And since the Legendary run is account wide you can start a one use character if they use this challenge again.  Even if you plan on Just sitting in a Bush you need a weapon.
---
*almost* doesn't matter what it is as long as it bloodied someone will buy it.
---
Yea I think it’s glitched I needed 2500 overseer xp and I did a challenge that needed 4K and I didn’t get the ghille suit 😑
---
My first CAMP was near the lighthouse. I'd always do the event and then invite anyone else who joined to get their shit done.
---
Thats nice 😀
---
Thats how its done 💪
---
No one on the planet knows how it works since it seems to change every time
---
Its kinda like when someone hands you a flyer on the street... instead of throwing them away, we give them to new players.. we have THAT many... hehe
---
Public team challanges will still work if it's only you in the team, if that helps you any
---
Solid imo
---
Ghillie jockstrap and Ghillie harness for the deviants among us!
---
I run carnivore. I have no use for fertiliser. I don't even have a brahmin in my camp. Why would I want chickens?
---
I got level 8 in about 4 hours, over two days.
---
Not to bad.
---
People who exploit suck. Betheseda is trying their damdest to work out the bugs while also working on new content.
---
And when you think about it, any MMO has nothing but a grind at end-game. I'm simply taking it slow. If I get 200 hours out of my $40, I'm all good.
---
Horse shit is free too but nobody wants it..Its offensive to take free stuff in my culture we aint no capitalists.Long live the proletariat
---
Exactly.
---
Yes. Very if max lvl.
---
Are you talking about the mastery pass or the seasons?  Because you are really bent out of shape over 3 packs if you mean seasons.  Also, dunno if you know about rotation but it basically means a gap in your collection is meaningless.  Welcome to magic.
---
Tested and out of 10 attempts none caused my friend radiation damage. But exp. bait and god mode are confirmed *not* patched.
---
Sry bud someone already bought them all. Have 80 or so fusion cores if you need them
---
According to fed76 a quad harpoon gun is worth:
---
If you're selling this, you can expect payment in items of highest possible quality. If you want to buy such weapon, prepare appropriate offer. Caps can't buy this.
---
So yeah. It’s a desirable weapon.
---
Al take them
---
Like the teams, hate the loss of Atoms.
---
Not everyone runs carnivore
---
Mastery pass.
---
When I say seasons, I mean any mechanic that is basically nothing more than a level grind with time-gated rewards.
---
I just accept i’m not going to miss those particular points.
---
Nope, faschnaut 2 had different rewards.
---
Honestly, the more I play NW the more I am actually starting to like it.
---
I love nuclear winter if I have a decent team.
---
No. It won't.
---
I like you.
---
I’d rather pay and have the season pass be doable and not make me feel I can’t miss one day or even one daily and lord help me if they have a regular daily I won’t do cause I’d find it miserable to do (The daily NW daily anyone? I know I’m not the only one who has absolutely 0 interest in playing NW). 
---
I like red dead’s season pass so I’m not even anti season pass. I like grinding as long as it is reasonable. I like having something to level up and give me a goal to work for. But when you make it so it is pretty much impossible for me to do or I feel I can’t take a break or do things that I find fun to level it it breaks the fun. Red dead’s lets me choose what to do to level it up. I can level it up as much as I want in one day or as little and just make up for it in another day. Hell, I’d feel like I was really getting my money’s worth if I had to buy it cause the gold they charge you get back by leveling it up (it’s just they hope that you don’t have enough gold to start it so you pay to get the gold. But you can get it back and spend it on other things once the pass is done). All I really want is for there to be some flexibility so I don’t have to do every daily and maybe even skip some weeklys so I don’t have to worry about missing a day or even doing some daily I really don’t want to do (I’m going to scream If kill a legendary near a fissure still exists or kill a mega sloth in the big. Both require really good luck to even find and having a stealth build and hating to run and gun fissure sites are not fun for me even if I could almost always find a legendary there$.
---
If youve been in this subreddit at least a day what you call legitimate complaints being explained those calling for violence against devs, calling them gorillas, and the slew of other making calling and personal bashing then I guess you're right. Maybe we live in a time where tweeting hate over every little whim is ok. 
---
A legitimate complaint is saying "hey devs, your ammo machine isn't intuitive, it's slow and nearly worthless." Not you should be slapped for this.
---
Anyone can mask angst in the form of  "freedom of speech" or "legitimate complaints." Until the day comes when this sub stops stamping their feet over "a game I spent my hard earned money on" I'll call it angst.
---
Yeah, the United Nations of *'MURICA.*
---
Source: Proud and nonsensical American
---
I just tried the quest five times...Actually got the toy and killed the final Sentry on one attempt just to have the server kick me with some random communication error message. Wasted an absolute stupid amount of ammo and supplies repairing armor etc. Died 3 times...Fantastic that the main story line is bugged. Canceling my membership
---
Exactly. 
---
I thought Facebook was bad with people crying about this game (and other stupid shit besides), so I quit using it after a decade.
---
This shit here's fucking ridiculous. 
---
I've only been active on here for like a week and it's almost to the FB level of annoyance.
---
Its an online rpg/mmo this is how it should have been from the beginning.
---
Why do you hate 'murica?
---
I would use 1 for Queen fights. AA offers a better damage boost than TS and FFR will up your DPS. Explosives in general aren’t very effective on the Queen. TSE also breaks much quicker, so you might have to repair your weapon mid-fight.
---
TSE will be great for everyday use though. It still breaks quickly, but you’ll really notice the explosive damage against regular enemies.
---
I know, but personally this update has been garbage. The rewards are too lame for veterans who play the game constantly, but too hard to get for the casual newbie. The only thing I wanted turned out to be a disappointment and I know a lot of others feel the same. The removal of atoms for daily challenges was a real EA move by Bethesda.
---
Yeh i found moving the mouse off to one side so it doesn't miss select takes a few goes to get it set.just.right
---
I love that score so much ❤
---
I think it should be possible for casual players to compete it
---
I see nothing wrong with the idea
---
Same here, I get to play about 2 days a week, between work and time with family. All this extra bullshit just made it harder to enjoy what was already there. Although the public teams are pretty nice.
---
I agree, like I get that giving players more reason to grind is a easy solution to increasing playtime but FUCK ME can't they just you know... invest in the story a bit?  
---
Give CAMPS and factions more purpose. Let me pick a handful of my friends from a list to create a joint village. Whenever I log in, instead of having a single camp it's a mix of different camps.
---
Imagine not just doing BoS missions, but officially joining the Brotherhood and doing missions about create a base of operations OR just making it so within the BoS you have groups you can permanently join as a sort of guild function. Same for Responders and Enclave also.  
---
These groups can then fight against each other, they can roleplay and they can make their own damn story. Instead of forcing us to make do with a limited system
---
They're adding this to the game pass for xbox. The game is dead, if it was ever alive. Bethesda is garbage
---
Jesus christ people just do the weekly repeatable an extra time and stop crying about NW.
---
The season should be toned down a bit for players that cannot go in everday and collect.im fortunate to be able to do this but i can understand the frustration of others.
---
If she’s in the air I can’t even hurt the queen anyway cuz I’m a melee build :)
---
Depends on the other perks and level. But, if it’s priced right it probably sell.
---
Unfortunately no.
---
Ok I can do 50c ea. Psn same as here. Should be on in about 30-40. Please put cores in the request :)
---
All i want is that black matter combat skin and I'm happy dont really care for all the other stuff tbh its all just cosmetic at the end of the day
---
Exactly. I'm on my way towards lvl 13, and it's only day two.
---
I was actually okay with trying it until the first person I encountered just jumped around like a kangaroo until he killed me
---
Shine ya boots guv'na? Two shillins a'piece?
---
You can create a public team on a private server but only people on your server can join.  So if its just you no one is going to join your team.
---
&gt; I was able to complete one of the seasons in red dead online in a matter of days.
---
Because usually season passes are an extra layer added ontop of the regular exp system and gameplay loop. **It's not its own standalone system requiring its own mechanics**.
---
The summer season is dependent of challenges to award "points", which come across as extremely restrictive.
---
It wouldn't be much of an issue if all game content awarded a certain amount of score points (public events, quest completion, etc), then the progress would become natural instead of a daily check list.
---
But this come from a studio with dozens of precedents of bad designs so here we are...
---
I store stuff that I would actually need  on a regular basis or stuff that's actually "difficult" to come by.  Why would I waste stash on fertilizer when I'm just a 30 cap fast travel away from 5-10 bags worth of it.
---
No.
---
Yes i agree. The only real good thing added was public teams. Great addition
---
That's true. I never pvp, so I hadn't considered that. That does blow.
---
It's a real pita if the stuff you like is near the end of the track. If you enjoy the rewards in the first half it doesn't seem bad. 
---
Hopefully they'll take in feedback for the next season and improve this one as it develops.
---
FOMO attacks boobooboobooboobs!
---
FOMO uses *"Grind Harder!"*
---
It's not very effective.
---
I like to think it keeps the game interesting. Fallout 76 bugs are a daily challenge itself. Still love this game and I wouldn’t even play games if i didn’t play Fallout 76. The bugs are outrageous compared to other mainstream games but it honestly doesn’t bother me enough to stop. This may be downvoted but this is how I see it. Vault Dweller for life!
---
Yeah I use mine. It's 90% decor and 10% for what it was intended for. I wouldn't recommend buying one for anything to do with spoilage.
---
If they do, I doubt they would be convinced to listen - most people tend to err on the side of absolutely no social graces when discussing their 'issues' here.  I know I wouldn't want to help.
---
I've always felt you catch more flies with honey....
---
Nukes codes stay the same every week you can google them you just need a nuclear keycard. Nukes are disappointing though, they just dont spawn enough enemies. Then every 200+ will go through with thier bloody builds and 1 shot everything. Makes the whole experience boring at best .
---
Yeah I found this out yesterday and was pretty annoyed. Those were the only items I actually wanted from the whole season just for nuclear winter.
---
“You think anybody thinks I’m a failure because I go home to ~~Starla~~ Sofia at night?! Forget about it”
---
is it that bad?
---
Honestly, the repeatable seems like it can be done while completing the dailies themselves. So you're ahead of the game, but it shouldn't be hard to keep up with that part if a person is able to do the regular logging. &gt;.&lt;
---
*"IT LOUDER!"*
---
Took me roughly 30 to get the Glowing Costume as a bush wookie. But I am an active bush wookie not full afk, all but 2 or 3 of those matches was a top 10 finish.
---
You won't get banned for picking up stuff even if it has been duped. The only possible way someone will get banned is if they have 10k of a plan or something outrageous like that. And even that is rare. A lot of people (myself included) have benefited from this trickle down duped items economy. I have been gifted 100 xmas presents. Were they duped at some point? Absolutely. Was the person who gave them to me the one who duped them? Not necessarily. It's just so hard to separate it now. That is why only the crazy high number is what alarms Bethesda.
---
I figured as much, they do look nice though.. kicking myself for not buying the Rustic Icebox
---
You did bad math is what you did. 
---
YouTube: Norespawns
---
He just made a video with legitimate calculations.
---
It depends what you play games for I guess.
---
As for what’s the fun if everybody gets to level 100? Well other people’s experiences don’t really matter to me. It’s my experience that matters to me and honestly, I’d like some of those late season rewards. I don’t care if everyone else gets there too, wouldn’t bother me if they did.
---
As for isn’t the point the challenge of it, it depends on the person. I don’t actually play games for challenge, I play for fun and the experience of it. After work/life/etc, I have no real interest in challenge when it comes to my ‘relax time’. Also I’d add that some basic checklists to complete is hardly ‘challenge’, it’s just a time sink and nothing more because (and understandably) its not possible to make enough actual meaningful content for people to play through without dragging it out with score numbers to hit from completing ‘busy work’.
---
In all honesty, I won’t be grinding out those 100 levels completing busy work. That’s exactly why I quit playing Destiny 2 three or so months ago. There’s no substance to what this progression track is. As much as I want those rewards, it’s just not worth the effort for  me. For others, those last rewards will be a dangling carrot through which this grind will leave some of those player bitter with the game, which considering my time with the Destiny franchise, I’ll completely understand.
---
So yeah, I think it comes down to what we as individuals play games for and how much reaching that goal matters to us. Some won’t care, some will be annoyed, others will get burnt out.
---
But really, with it actually being impossible to create enough meaningful content to fill a season that isn’t just busy work, what other option is there? If it was easy and quick to complete, then we’d also be complaining that there’s nothing left to do after a couple of weeks.
---
Lol no. They stopped caring about that a long time ago
---
You're winning
---
dunno why you're getting thumbs down, it's a legitimate fact that on PC, legacies are getting out of control, along with every other exploit they haven't nailed down, and it's been over 18 months since they promised they would patch it. Nothing of the sort has come. It's clear they have no solution for it, but the answer is very simple: remove them.
---
There are definitely folks who won't benefit from the season, my post was mainly just about whether it's even possible to complete the run without spending. 
---
We'll have to see if stuff like the repeatable weeklies contribute a little or a lot of score.
---
Hopping it’s an oversight on their part, I was really disappointed today when I went to play and couldn’t equip the skin
---
I've preordered some games in the past, been playing games since the Atari days and the only word that comes to mind here is "Expectations."
---
Keep them low for any game and any developer.
---
Don't pre order any game, ever.
---
Don't spend your money on a game based on what you hope it will eventually be, base your decision on what it is now. If you don't like what you see now or don't like what you're hearing from others about the game, then don't buy it.
---
I didn't buy this game until a week or so before Wastelanders came out, because I heard so much that was bad about it.... I held off. I only bought it because I had some spare money and wanted to get a game.
---
I expected it to be crap and my expectations were very low. I ended up enjoying what I paid for and what I got. Wastelanders was just a nice bonus, personally speaking, because I didn't even know it was coming. I based my expectations on this being an online Fallout game with robots, no human NPCs and a few odd other players here and there..... And bugs.
---
I learned from pre ordering Red Orchestra 2 and No Man's Sky and buying into the almost decade long Early Access Rust to learn the hard way what some in here are starting to realise..... Don't give devs the benefit of the doubt and don't buy things with the hopes of what it might become later on.
---
You only leave yourself in disappointment and to be frank, you only have yourself to blame for being a chump.
---
All this complaining and moaning, that's what it is, amounts to nothing and doesn't change anything. Games still come out in Early Access because people keep buying them in EA. Games keep coming out full of bugs and rushed because people keep handing their money over for this level of quality. People come in and complain, rant and go on about how they hate the game, hate the updates and hate the devs.... Yet they keep playing.
---
Downvote cuz you don't like the truth, I don't give AF
---
I noticed that the emotes flash up next to each team members icon on the screen so that's handy
---
Welllllllllllll there's a first time for everything.
---
Thank god somebody mentioned RDR2. They did the season passes right.
---
That’s what I thought, I think I expected alot more from the endgame. Guess I’ll wait until seasons come out.
---
Btw, I love building, but you just can’t build anything cool with such a small budget.
---
Oh yeah, I did the repeatable 3 times while doing the dailies, then it went up to 8 times when I actually put fourth effort into XP grinding. I had two buddies on my building team so we had a good XP boost going, plus my full urban unyielding armor set.
---
More pointless than bad. Why store food when a few carrots in the ground grow back so quick. If you made a ton of buff food then maybe. I generally eat the same batch of food across three casual sessions with the food lasting thanks to the fridge.
---
But yeah, totally a luxury and not needed at all. Truly it's a better furniture piece.
---
Thanks I appreciate the help. I just started and I am having fun so far. Got a lot of stuff during Fasnacht so it would sucked to get banned for something I didn’t know was wrong. Thanks again for the help. I appreciate it a lot
---
Same. I don’t normally play, but when I was doing my daily and I died I got rewarded a Christmas wreath lol. The Halloween and Christmas rewards are back due o a bug
---
Restarting the game should fix it. If you play NW and then join the normal game you'll have that sound whenever a message pops up on the top left.
---
I totally want a Watoga map. There's so much verticality that would be a blast.
---
how?
---
Wrong. Bethesda bad. Gold up top please.
---
Wow really? Are you joking?
---
Until I see the proof I will slide this into the rumors column
---
It's not that they're bad at communicating, they just dont care...we've already given them our money. That's all this game was about, since they take longer and longer to release games and each one is worse than the last. They have to make money in between so they put out garbage with micro transactions. From a business stand point it makes sense. Also, theyve put all their eggs in the same basket, starfield. They are counting on that game to restore their name. And they all know, just as we know, that no matter what we're gonna buy starfield too. That will have awful bugs to start with, that's inevitable at this point. But who cares bc we would have already bought it. We let them get away with it so why would they stop the shenanigans?
---
Yea I think it would be better if more folks judged the season based on what  they get vs. what they put in, rather than expecting or desiring it all and then realizing that doesn't suit their game time. 
---
The major problem I still have with it though is the ladder system. The two items I want most are near the end, so it's a long effort (in terms of time spent and wait) to get very few things. I'm hoping next time they'll incorporate more choice into the thing.
---
Yeah it'll be back and on sale I bet.
---
Brain Bombs are better. +3 INT for 90 minutes.
---
 I wouldn't argue with a mentally ill person shitting their pants on the train either.
---
Hit lvl 8 last night im on 12 right now and have gained at least 100k exp since yesterday.  I think overall this is good especially if you play on teams
---
Thank you all for the suggestions and assistance. I got my decontamination shower now.
---
HERETIC! BURN THE MATH HERETIC!
---
Are there any rewards that people actually want at the 90+ bracket? The red handmade skin is about the only thing up there that looks any good, imo.
---
I noticed that as well.  I went from 200% to about 60% in almost no time at all compared to before the patch.  I have Gunsmith 5 as well.  Almost like it wasn't there.
---
I just got it today and I am absolutely baffled on how to use it. I was super excited to set it up so I can get rid of the 2.2 million rounds of .38 I have and the damn thing makes no sense. Or maybe it’s me. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
One thing I'm wondering is whether these items can be built by other builders in our camp. I believe that's possible with stuff acquired in-game, but not for atom shop stuff.
---
Sad that I dropped over 4k .38 a couple weeks back
---
Save perk packs for events. The duplicates turn into free xp
---
Just did it and it was fine. Never had a problem with this event.
---
It's like that on Xbox too sometimes on public servers. Other times it's fine. 
---
They slowed it down not long after launch because of a duping bug, but it's a good bit slower now.
---
Camera angles have been wonky too.
---
Yeah I'd have a real problem 😂
---
In two weeks the option will unlock, it'll cost 150 atoms per rank (no spending on score itself).
---
Lmao the mechanic isn’t poor, they’re even letting you fix your crops for free.
---
I mean, it sounds like you don't like it any more. So... Maybe play a different game? Lol
---
This is good intermediate content to keep no lifers satisfied yet they’re still moaning..
---
[I don’t know what you guys are talking about, my system works great for the terminal](https://youtu.be/R_rF4kcqLkI?t=2m50s)
---
I didn’t really focus on any build since its my first character. But yeah I just think that the cycle of collecting caps/buying plans/collecting more caps just isn’t very fun when you don’t feel the need to explore the world anymore.
---
It could be really fun if it wasn’t on this crappy engine, there’s so much stability issues that just makes the mode clunky as hell. I die in gunfights due to frame rate drops when I switch weapons or try to move. This game could be so fantastic if it was made on a new engine
---
So want to waste a resource like 10 fertilizer to replant 1 crop instead of just using 1 of that same crop? That makes no sense.

Tying camp budget to season progress is a hard no from me. Agree with you on the rest. I'm level 9 and I wasnt really trying. A couple of the weekly's I had to make a point to do, like building up a workshop. It was cool though cause someone came and helped me defend it.
---
Tried once, I’d rather play Pubg than that. That is, if I liked the battle royale games, no I don’t.
---
I feel like fallout 76 was good enough without Nuclear Winter. That’s just my opinion.
---
Just kill them and THEN go repair your stuff. Also, 5-10 is not a big deal when handling pests.
---
If this was a single player game then someone could just make a mod to be able to teach her a lesson. Unfortunately, they saved little miss more annoying than Preston and little miss more annoying than Nazeem for this game.
---
Forcing us to buy atoms to complete the run does not seem out of the real of possibility here
---
I actually do run around and gather stuff to make the fancy food for funsies, so maybe I'll find some use for it
---
all my ingredients really weigh me down after a while and I gotta keep them on me since I run the better with salt perk
---
sooo yea, I may like it then lol
---
Score from events isn’t broken at least not for me. I played today for 3 hours and got all the way to the 7th square or when I logged off I just received the piping skin I leveled up once. As soon as I logged on joined or made an event team. I played every event that popped up. Made me pay some I haven’t played in a long time like the bots one at the old purveyor spot I don’t remember what it’s called most of them I did by my self. Couple were the enclave ones were it does bomb drop. They all gave me score. Kill legendaries and scrap stuff. If it stays like this it will be super easy to get everything. I really don’t see what every one is complaining about. Only thing today that sucked is I did the line in the sand one at the asylum were the scorched waves come at you. There were 4 of us there so all the players the scorched and the scorch beast flying around made it really choppy which got super annoying. That was only crappy thing to happen today. I’m on Xbox and I’m a lvl 206. Crappy frame rate on a console was the worst thing to happen all day. I was getting score from stuff i didn’t even know I had to do.
---
Of course. Giving gifts actually is a pretty big part of this community. Some of the stuff like xmas gifts, certain plans (especially the mounts), tokens and ammo were heavily duped. But again, you won't get in any trouble for picking up one of each of the plans to learn. Other high level players like to make noob kits for players chems, ammo, weapons, armor, etc. As long as the loot bag is visible, it's probably a genuinely kind gesture. Some people like to lure others into traps, so just kinda use common sense of don't follow a stranger into a dark hallway. Haha.
---
I didnt know this.
---
it is possible.  you need to copy or move the pictures to "C:\\Users\\(your username)\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Photos\\(account folder)", or whatever the equivalent would be for your operating system.
---
🙏🏻
---
Several features that have been added were posted here as suggestions for the game. Player vending, the FO1st tent, vault raids, survival mode, ammo converter... Lots of small things. Now whether these were actually original ideas generated by this subreddit or just parroted here I'm not sure but even the faction system was something that was suggested
---
Sorry for crappy writing.
---
I’d rather the hard grind than seeing loss of idiots running round in spacesuits. It would depreciate the reward if everyone had it
---
Like alot of things Video games become a form of escapism, its only safe to assume people become passionate about the things we use to unwind and vent. Case in Point.... Tom Hanks and a volleyball, dude cried when he watched Wilson float away. Were all human my friend.
---
lol no, they wont.
---
You sound just like me, hiding in a bush almost always gets me to the final 10. I rely heavily on VATS in the main game so actually killing people in NW is pretty much out of the question. My reaction time and reflexes are just awful.
---
Do I have to rename them? I just checked the folder and there are files for the thumbnails too.
---
Those two award score at 3/5 instead of 5/5
---
mathsmatics
---
Didn’t even know that its that rare, should try to find it
---
I’m not getting the black screen, but I’ve completed 3 challenges today and didn’t get my SCORE.
---
This glitch happened to me but i got the score before i even did the challenge
---
Was this other day *yesterday,* as in like a little over 24 hours ago?
---
Yes. You have to earn the items that come before it first. So 2500 for this, 2500 for that, then 2500 for the Ghillie Suit (you did spell it right). I haven’t gotten it yet either so I could be wrong but I am unlocking other things so...
---
Okay i can see why it would be a hard no, but it there is a lot of players who have been playing since day one, they should be allowed to have a bigger a base then the new people. They have much more items to show off so thats why it should reasonable.
---
I got my ranger outfit and robot dance emote, that’s all I wanted.
---
(Oh and the private world tent scrap box and free monthly atoms is cool too I guess.)
---
On a serious note I’m pretty content with FO1st as long as they keep adding new stuff to it every once in awhile, that atomic scout skin encouraged me to finally get a full set of max level unyielding urban scout armor, already had the urban scout mask too so I’ve been enjoying my new complete UNY set that isn’t made of several different armors. Me and my friends enjoy the private worlds too, they run so much better than public sessions. (Plus it’s nice to do events without some random knob jockey killing all the legendary stuff in one shot. And those 1650 atoms a month are a blessing in these times since the daily and weekly atoms got removed...)
---
I actually feel like I got my money’s worth from it.
---
Ghillie takes 14000 if I remember correctly in all.
---
That's the way to do it. No problems then. It's one less person out there trying to kill me. I do get paranoid when I'm in a bushy area now though. I strafe over suspect bushes before I let my guard down.
---
We need this.  Very much so.  It should just wander over to bushes and stand in the bush, saying things.
---
NEEEEED
---
100% you could probs get great use from it.
---
I'm sure there are plenty of toons with enough atoms to buy their way to 100. Otherwise there doesn't seem to be a way to exploit the system. 
---
Still using multiple toons only give the reward to one character, but I'm looking at starting a second character for this reason.
---
Yea, I think there's compromise for a system like this. To me the ideal situation for most reward systems would be that everyone can get 90% of the rewards, some will just need more time than others, and then there's still a good 10% of rewards that are just really really hard to get, to ensure the game feels like it has tantalizing challenges and isn't just low hanging fruit for everyone.
---
You have to complete the stages before it, first unlock is wasteland loveseat for 150xp, then it'll go onto the next unlock which is a weapon skin for 2000xp. Right up until the suit, its more like 14500 xp all in you need to get.
---
There's an event by Tyler County Dirt Track called leader of the pack thsts almost always up. Youre always guaranteed to kill 3 one star legendaries every time.
---
You cant use atoms yet to buy your way to the end though?  
---
And God Mode, load up on XP items (Bobble-heads etc), exit god mode (death by rads), get XP, the xp challenge can be repeated over and over

Wasn’t the story with that vault the women actually made the man a slave and worked him to death? I thought I heard that from somewhere.
---
11 in about 16 hours.
---
I suspect there are some sick players out there who will find ways to get massive XP grinds and get through the season a lot faster than the rest of us.
---
Try to kill people. You might like it.
---
👀
---
It really comes down to your build and legendary weapons.
---
e.g. a bloodied build, using legendary bloodied weapons will result in a massive increase in damage over your typical standard level 50 weapons. 
---
I run a rifle/shotgun build. My non-legendary weapons gets well over 100 damage and I have no issue with anything other than the real bitches, like assaultrons and the SBQ. In those scenarios, legendaries and help from others become essential. My high strength helps with melee too.
---
I don’t feel like grinding another character. Mainly because of how much time I’ve spent doing challenges. I really hate the atomic shop and the challenges system. I mostly ended up not having fun and trying to get more atoms from stupid challenges where you need to craft/scrap low level junk, kill enemies etc. The game would be so much more pleasant without the atomic shop.
---
I just hope they dont fix the power armor glich thats how i do my silo runs
---
Even with all that the grind is still way too much for a game with no good new content :(
---
you shouldnt need to rename them, and they wouldnt need the thumbnail versions either, in order to appear as loading screens.  i tested it myself using a screenshot and it worked.
---
It's been acknowledged by a community manager. 
---
NW is dropping Christmas and Halloween (and I think the Ghillie suit from awhile ago) on accident right now at their usual exp requirements.
---
It was also mentioned they're not going to take these rewards from you if you go ahead and get them now so grind away.
---
Believe it's like 27001 exp for all the Christmas stuff. Much less for the Halloween stuff and Ghillie suit.
---
Do you really want me to have to go out and fuck up the server by launching nukes for the sole purpose of flux collection so I can fix my shower? No? Don’t implement this then.
---
And also u need to take away the points for the NW challenge because hardly anyone even wants to touch that mode because I know I ain’t
---
Oh really? I thought you could I thought I saw the buy rank with atoms option? Maybe it was a screenshot from the PTS? 
---
Still would have to use multi roomed accounts because of the time constraint on the server side challenges IMHO. Maybe there is a pc mod I don't know about?
---
We should all merge together in PA and form a giant Liberty Prime to defeat these evils.
---
Sounds like you already made up your mind about the game.
---
If it doesn't rustle your jimmies then just move on. Plenty of other things to do with your free time.  Its got bugs since day 0.
---
Ah ah ah, don’t forget buying your way up instead of earning it after week 2. Might buy the atom ranks because 150 - 150 = 0, so I effectively skip a rank for free.
---
I agree but I want to see things like that tied to quest lines. 
---
Maybe you find a lone settler and over a series of quests help him establish a camp if his own. The settler repays you in camp budget increments of 5% for a total of 20% for instance.
---
Similar things for % damage (up to 5 or 10%) maybe. I'd love to see some areas on the map have really strong enemies, like everythings legendary sheepsquatch strong. Perfect for the new public teams feature and I love the idea of places on the map that you just know not to come unprepared too. New players need to accident stroll into these zones and get crushed, fueling their desire to grind until they can crush back.
---
I just want the game to be great, it's currently just alright. Slowly trending up though.
---
I actually tried an XP grind yesterday, let’s just say it involved glasses caverns and touching weird rocks.
---
I have to advise heavily against this method, eventually my FPS dropped down to like one frame a second and it didn’t stop even after resetting the server, it finally went away after I died and got to a place I could scrap stuff...
---
Moral of the story kids, don’t look for easy XP exploits and glitches, just take a nap for well rested, eat some canned meat stew, team up with your buddies on a builder team, then go murder the sentry bots at whitesprings for 700XP, and super mutants at west Tek for 290XP each.
---
Yea it was coming up with the prompt to pay for me too
---
I never received any S.C.O.R.E. at that point either, so I think they're bugged for me.
---
Yeah don't post anything positive whatever you do.
---
Heaven forbid anyone actually like what the games going through.
---
Fuck I'd kill for Beth to announce a higher gear cap than 45 or 50.... Could you imagine the rioting.
---
Whatever Sage is smoking I want some.
---
(Can you imagine what marijuana in the Fallout universe is like being all mutated and whatnot? ...or if it was nuked and turned into flux?)
---
With a full team, 3 big event adds up to 10k or so xp anyway.  I just got exactly 4k xp for completing scorched earth on a 3 person public team (had canned meat stew active I think).
---
I got the score in my first match.  Lasted 7 minutes.
---
Dammit haha. Thanks for info
---
Thats reasonable, maybe 5 percent is too hight maybe 1 percent is reasonable for the season pass. Like the season pass is great but it would be better with this it would incentive people to truly grind it out
---
The come-hither icon helps when the other three don't know your starting the imposter. As I can't stop doing that one.
---
Ya my ss guass shotgun paint isnt working for nuclear winter but the camo one is. Its definitely a mistake.
---
Same issues. All I really wanted was the clean sink, and other than that, the firefly lamp, the wallpapers, and the chicken coop. I’m worried I may not manage that.
---
So do I need to just keep playing till I get 14k xp?
---
Isn’t that event over? The one for the suit?
---
Adrenaline not working is really screwing me up
---
There is a glitch right now where you can get the suit and halloween and Christmas items but xp doesn’t track for it
---
I feel you, annoying as heck
---
It hasn’t been forgotten their adding new stuff in near future
---
Maybe? I was drunk as hell yesterday, lol.
---
We only need Healing Salve Mire now, had a great day knocking 4 off the list.  I don't think I personally have any of those you listed, but I think you can buy Protective Raider or at least can with a new character or friend that doesn't know shielded.  Double check the Raider vendors, I was able to buy all but protective BOS(Defiance Has Fallen) with a 2nd character.
---
Whether it's a bug or intentional, it makes sense to add them to the loot pool of grenades. You can get all the other grenades by looting, you just need to plan to *craft* them yourselves
---
Back when the event first came out I successfully did it 20 times and never got either the outfit or helmet. My buddy ended up giving me the helmet and a bought the outfit from some random person for 5k caps. So judging from my luck alone, it’s worth way more than 5k caps like I see everyone saying it’s worth.
---
That was the most tedious one I thought. 
---
I just built a work shop, the shed has 20 lights hanging from the ceiling.
---
But I ended up building it up some more and laid down essentials for anyone that might come along.
---
Yeah I feel like they need to do more research on games with successful pass systems.
---
The only things I could *possibly* want is the combat ghillie and marine ghillie (NW will be so much easier with ghillie marine armor) and the only thing I definitely want is the Secret Service ghillie skin. But that’s locked behind 82 ranks. And rank 91 gives you 100 bullion. How demoralising has that got to be?
---
Happens here to. Playing on PC. Have an up to date system. Hardware exceeds what FO76 requires. Go AFK for more than 20 mins and game freaks out. It's bad enough to where a system reboot is required.
---
I'd honestly be happy with a hardmode so everything was really tough and we had to coop more to survive. Am hoping that the level scaling monster update toughens things up a bit.
---
Go on...
---
Get the black screen often in the past few weeks. PS4.
---
Someone helped me get this one done: turns out all you need is to die with your feet on water, not actually swimming, for it to count.
---
Inspirational all the way. That extra 5% boost to the team at level one and if other people share the perk it stacks.
---
I'd always bulk it, keep stacks of 5 and sell the rest.
---
Dont sell acid, lead, steel (probably), ballistic fiber.
---
I actually feel like with the launch of SCORE, FO1st has become more valuable. This is sneaky but basically by taking away my ability to earn as much ATOM and instead get set rewards (less choice), it’s now more attractive to me to get monthly ATOM, either to pick ATOM shop items that aren’t Part of the season rewards or to buy season ranks to unlock a reward when I don’t feel like grinding anymore (that’s a mild form of P2W?). Anyway having that monthly ATOM is nice and that currency just went up in value with seasons
---
Agreed!
---
If you pick  and jack you way there you can cut the silo run part in half.
---
Additionally their is a new way to by pass the entire silo by wall breaching with the PA glitch and getting into the launch room.
---
The thing is the amount you need per level increases each level, so if there isn’t some cap, you will have to do every single challenge, and still have to do 90 of the get 10,000 xp challenges to get lvl 100
---
I gave up on bullion. At least with this I don’t have to actively ever be working towards it. Still don’t care enough to do it though. There is still no content to do that’s the issue for me. We need a expansion.
---
That’s not a speed that can be maintained tho lol
---
How can I get legendary scrap and if I were to go for the Chinese stealth armor do I need that to craft it
---
I know you can get the Christmas and Halloween stuff but are you sure you can get the suit?
---
We have to wait another year for bug fixes
---
If I play 2 days a week it might be
---
I believe its the wendigo colossus xD
---
I’m not sure I’ve finished dailies 10 times lol.
---
Inside a tree? Is it a glitch?!
---
Yeah I am terrible at pvp. I started playing nuclear winter for the survivor rewards, I needed that chandelier. Now I am up to lvl 56 and according to my challenges have killed a total of 10 player's.
---
My goal is to get to the top 10 and then try and get as close to the remaining teams as I can to take goofy pictures without them finding me.
---
I’m certain it will be in the atomic shop.
---
This is an excellent suggestion.
---
All releases to date I've thoroughly enjoyed building with!!
---
I too would like to know this
---
I didn't even know that was thing for this event...
---
The only reason they would release this P.O.S. is to troll their player base. We are nothing but a joke to them.
---
Nope, if anything I'm more encouraged. Ive been thinking about 76 all day at work today. That hasn't happened since vendors were released. I think it's a great system. I don't understand everybody here doing nothing but complain about it.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
Just accepted. Will join you
---
No it’s not mentioned in the notes, but mine got noticeably weaker after the patch.
---
I will help you
---
Yup. Like I got to 10 on the first day but playing literally 10hrs today I only got 2.5.
---
The one where u fase though walls i use that to make my runs faster
---
they would complain  "only 1% for all that grind"
---
It'll be a positive change if we ever achieve it.
---
Probably not the place to ask this, but my character isn't crippled. Is not even close to weight capacity. Food and water are full. I cannot walk in power armor, only creep extremely slow. Cannot use vats in power armor either
---
Its nice that thats all compiled together. I figured op was refering to whats currently available with this glitch goin on.
---
Most likely a dead body animation glitch where they die certain spots.
---
Or it melded with the plant for an even stronger hybrid!
---
My only battle pass comparison is Destiny.  Maxing out the pass is fairly easy and very straightforward - XP = progress.  But there are other things to grind for (like seals (titles)), plus rewards for going past the max level in terms of bonus character power.
---
Gotta say, Destiny is bad to timegate things too, but the season pass progress isn't one of them.
---
Hello
---
I mean, if that's all you're playing for, I understand how you feel that way. I personally play for my own reasons.
---
Yeah their spin and reality did not match. But it is not the first time they did not know what they were doing. Competing marketing gurus running a development shop will do that.
---
Yes you can. Hold the B/circle/PC equivalent button to instantly back out if any terminal.
---
I was playing earlier today with the Gauss Shotgun and experienced none of these things.
---
Upvoted for visibility, hope Bethesda are aware and can fix it soon
---
The bulk of your progress will be the first day or two of each week, so that makes sense
---
You put down a power armor in a spot where you don't enter it in a animation and just stand there for a few seconds. Once you have control again, run against a door and when the power armor automatically appears on you, you'll clip through the door. This works on literally every building in the game and you can bypass all the silo doors lasers etc in 5mins. People call it breaching. Silos have 3 doors to breach to reach the control room.
---
It’s a double legacy (both quad and explosive). It would be worth a few legacies to the right buyer.
---
how long it prolongs the life span of food? I mean I just eat everything I find even rotten stuff out of lazynes to farm meat all day.
---
I'd rather have atoms but...Bethesda wants us paying for Atoms not getting them for free :/
---
Honestly other then the space themed items, I'm not a fan of any of this crap (ok the sink was good and the ammo converter with a WAY better menu would be nice). I want my atom challenges back :/
---
Well getting 9000 per week with two big days per week is very doable.  But that won’t get you the rewards
---
Way too much sense. I have only scrapped one under armor. I am probably lucky. Beth thinks they are giving you more content if you delete your gear....
---
Yeah but Not to bad . . .
---
Radio voice: "Tonight, at Tales from Appalachia, a drunkard meets a mythic creature. Or does he?" 
---
Cues dramatic music
---
Mods do not benefit from said legendary effect
---
Issa bug
---
So even with correct math I have to play everyday for 10 weeks to reach 100.....fuck that
---
Mods dont count in the WR.
---
Thank you. Sadly I think all we will hear from Bethesda  is “want don’t to give an advantage”
---
There is actually two. One in generators that creates power and one cosmetic one that does not.
---
Still not as bad as saying “Toons”
---
It won't take longer if you have some experience with the game and you know where to go to find things.
---
As one of the guys with quite a popular "math" posts here said, weekly and daily challenges give the amount of score that's almost enough to complete the season. The rest is easily achievable just via 10000 xp weekly within season's time span.
---
Weekly challenges are easy to complete within couple hours, dailies require just a fraction of this time.
---
But yeah, we still do not know how the score requirements grow with later levels, so the situation might turn out worse than it currently looks like.
---
Paint and rename it.
---
That's the correct way to view this issue. Nobody is pointing a gun to your head and demanding you fulfill every challenge. If I don't feel like killing 10 liberators or crafting 15 types of alcohol in Adventure Mode , then I just accept that I'm missing out on those points.
---
+karma thanks! :)
---
I learned about Maths from the Look Around You educational series.  Great insights into British schooling!
---
No, thank you!
---
I don't know the time exactly but it's definitely good for quite a bit of real life time. I'd like to say a couple hours from Max condition to spoiled. I haven't ever had to pull spoiled food out.
---
I’ve been having this issue since I purchased it. 
---
I run around bashing the air just so I can reload or use a stim. I’ve given up and put it in my stash box until it gets fixed. PS4
---
I respect your decision and self-awareness.
---
How....what....how..!?
---
Pry cause ur using more bullets with perks being broke, I did nuke white springs on a private and out of the 10-15 3 stars if killed I haven't seen a single 3 star weapon or armor
---
I was able to hit level 9 last night just by playing a couple of hours. I don't want to have to play every day though...I can since I don't work...I got nothing but time but every day doing this is going to cause some burn out.
---
How does this help with reaching lvl 100?
---
What is the second one?
---
 Very nice!!! If the queen would land more often over there  i would try this!
---
1st person view seems to have issue most...I play in 3rd with no problem. However they did majorly nerf the gun this patch
---
Shielded SS Underarmor is indeed:
---
+4 Strength, +4 Endurance, and +2 Perception
---
Bought it and using it now. Worth the gold in my opinion. It's also 15/15/15 DMG resistance - a nice plus. Best overall shielded UA I have seen. Every little bit helps!
---
YMMV. Cheers
---
I was replying to someone else's post not the op
---
The surviror item set has camp items. Fire, loveseat, chandelier. I like all of them. They are currently available due to the glitch.
---
How so? First person player, and mine is still one shotting everything without all the damage perks.
---
Yeah the thing farthest along I think I'll get os the pip boy skin. But I don't have enough time to finishes the season with work and a baby. Wanted that secret door but oh well, not that bothered. I'll log in every now and then.
---
Yes, why wouldn't you?
---
I got the suit last night...I got all the rewards last night....well after 10 hrs lmao
---
yeah I have the barrel on it, looks like it goes down to under 3 without it, hmm that's a bummer.
---
Everyone knows you had U in British English!
---
Mauthus
---
*takes 13 doses Daddy-O
---
I kind of feel the same way. I got the ammo converter this evening. Once someone reminded me that you could use the back function on the terminal to go to the previous menu screen, I was fairly pleased with it. 
---
Then I spent far too long grubbing around for logs to collect wood 100 times for the Gather Building Supplies weekly. Not gather 100 units of wood scrap, mind you. They mean use the gather action on logs and woodpiles 100 times. Who thought that was a good idea?!
---
After wasting time on that pointless grind, I went through the next 95 slots on the game board. Like you, OP, I found there wasn’t a single thing on there I’d miss. Kind of took the pressure off, anyway. I’ll still play, but I don’t plan on going out of my way to grind for SCORE anymore.
---
I'm okay with it because looking at it, it just looks like a bunch of "meh" filler. Looking at you 8x Ghillie paints. That and now that I know the only good item, the ammo converter, is a big let down because of the poor interface and implementation, I won't regret not hitting 100.
---
This is why I feel crazy - it was painted. Like the rest of my armor. But now I'm second guessing myself
---
What are the chances
---
Not that one but all enemies I killed blew up. It was odd
---
50 caps for stable violet? lol.
---
Yao Gaui I can deal with. Glowing Mirelurk Kings on the other hand - yeesh.
---
I'd personally spend atoms for the last two levels since the cosmetics are worth it in my opinion. 300 atoms of the 1500 I'll get from seasonal rewards by that time feel like a good trade off for last levels' grind.
---
Secret service now that you can actually do stuff with it.
---
I completed the quest after going through the silo and launching my first nuke. My better half also completed it because we were on a team when I launched my nuke. You just missed out on launching the nuke. So nothing really serious. You didn't miss out on much. 80 atoms for launching your own but now you can take your time and do it when you want.
---
Wasn't on the PTS, i explained how its done, and its easy to detect and hopefully Bethesda actually does something
---
Well COVID-19 certainly helped earlier in the year at least
---
The grind didn’t take long for me. I think even though I worked most of my day. Playing for a good hour helped me do most of my events for treasury Notes. Once I had enough for the chest piece and the jet pack plan I immediately built one. I currently have a 1 star unyielding piece. I’ve been trying my luck for a week or so to see if I can get a better unyielding piece but no luck so far. And I obviously run a bloodied build. I like it. I think it’s fun. I hate wearing power armor so not needing one for a jet pack is a big deal for me.
---
I’ll be shocked if they don’t “accidentally” enable it
---
Hold out hope and keep doing Seasons, I'm sure it's just a temporary bug, and those skins will be worth it haha
---
Yeah I honestly assumed it would be closer to a one to one exchange. Really bummed out that it's not even close.
---
I’m guessing a bug affected it before?
---
For me...it's just a decoration that completes my kitchen.
---
They always have done, people just dont take any notice :(
---
Because of diminishing returns of DR/ER, any SS piece is only "worth it" if it has better legendary effects than what you are already wearing. So it basically comes down to whether or not you have a well-rolled SS chest or not, and personal preference in regards to the Jetpack mod.
---
Jetpack is fun, but it is definitely the number one cause of my character dying. Marsupial mutation is good enough until you have the spare bullion.
---
And I'm sure you know, but Buttressed and Jetpack are not mutually exclusive. But maybe the Dense mod would suit you better than Jetpack? But saying that, I have rank 3 Fireproof so I just run with the Jetpack for mobility on my melee character 🤷‍♂️ Either way, you can still have Buttressed.
---
But if you are talking about the bullion cost, you'd be far better off getting SS Underarmor and Shielded Lining over the Jetpack!
---
You can have both, I personally love the jet pack.
---
I see a lot of posts like this and I have to ask... Am I the only one who plays this game without the mindset that I HAVE to do the whole game in 3 days? I mean nothing is making you do any grind but your wanting to get every invisible item available.
---
I haven't changed the way I played since day one. I missed a lot of stuff but oh well that was my choice.  Since wastelanders I have played almost all day every day because I enjoy it... not because I want something that wont go to the grave with me when I die. This game is my sandbox because I play the game the game doesn't play me.
---
If you're so bothered by the game then take a break.
---
“Imma firin my lazar” Jesus Christ haven’t heard that one in a while.
---
No they just didn't have plans for it's mods.
---
Naw I beleive its glitched and not working cause it's doing the same for gun skins. My ss guass shotgun skin  isnt working for nw but the camo one is... obviously the camo is more of advantage. They wouldnt have made it a atom shop item if they didnt want it to be in nw. They woulda just made them a blueprint like the Easter bunny hat.
---
Which is stupid. It’s a sit in the face because technically they did say you get SCORE just by doing anything, but this is just an insult.
---
Don’t scrap hand them over to me and I’ll properly dispose of them
---
Intelligence doesn't effect exp.
---
Math, not even once. 
---
I do hope the joke has not been made, yet
---
Especially since late game you stumble across legendaries
---
But you’re doing the same thing you could have been doing before. Now there’s just numbers attached to it
---
I set a realistic goal for my self, as long as i make it 88 for the Cosmos Power Armor Skin im al good. It would be nice to get the whole 100, but i doubt it with my playtime. Right now im level 8 and its been 2 days.
---
Be alot cooler if there was a unique weapon you could choose from at the end like an alien rifle or large weapon,
---
ATLAS.  
---
So far the place is just boarded up with a couple Constructrons wandering about. There's a note in the tent from the guy who's apparently trying to get it secured.
---
It most definitely does. Now whether that is intended or not is another issue altogether.
---
That’s exactly what Todd would say
---
The hidden door is good for example.
---
I absolutely hate using the marsupial mutation, so the jetpack mod is an absolutely great thing to make use of quick vertical movement without having to jump 40ft in the air.
---
Thank you.
---
Evidence?
---
Have you previously had the game?
---
For the obligatory aside: remember you can use the Back button on the ammo converter terminal. (Tab on PC, dunno console).  So when it jumps to the main menu after a trade, hit that back button to return to the trade menu you just used. It’ll even keep the last operation highlighted/selected (if it’s still available).  
---
It’s still not wonderful, but that back button behavior reduces the operations required per trade considerably. The arbitrary daily limits are annoying, but I was still able to get my bullets for the session at least.
---
Yes
---
Pain is the ass right? The reload is manageable at best but it the gun also prevents stimpak shortcuts and even sprinting which combined is a recipe for death in a firefight
---
Good to know! I shoulda teamed up way before now haha
---
Me and my cousin who always play Multiplayer games together since ever, didn't expect to enjoy teaming up with random, but man has it been fun. We create a team (Event) and people join and actually follow us from even t event, it has honestly open a great door for potential fun.
---
Agree. Was in a nuke zone blasting away for my life and it filled my screen mid fight to tell me about a sink I don’t need, won’t use and care nothing about
---
People who play once a week wont be spening money on the game (unless theyvadd in a system where if you want the stuff at the end you have to)  
---
So the choice is to either play more (and get more invested and probably spend money) or dont play more and have to spend money to get the things you could have gotten free if youd played more
---
Yea I randomly got a urge to watch those videos the other day
---
I bought it just cause I had the bullion and the list of things I want is starting to thin out. I've used it quite a bit since I got it. Especially to get away from ghouls who surprise me.
---
For me no. I really dont understand the appeal of the jetpack. It was fun for about 2 days and more of a hassle than a positive. They just naturally drain AP so fast that it defeats the purpose.
---
Thanks for not fixing the friends list issues, it has fucked my wife and I from playing. I've bought two copies and started another account for both of us but nope. Since wastelanders release we haven't been able to join our private world or teams because we aren't friends. So not only have we paid for fallout 1st, purchased 2 copies of your game and spent money on Atom's and now what its worthless. I've looked online and threw all the corners and no fix and y'all have nothing. It's honestly pretty fucked up that this is still a thing and no one will address it.
---
As long as it is on the same Xbox account then yes you will keep everything
---
But that's optional. You dont have to play the season pass challenges. The base game is not grindy, and if you think it is, I can give you a guide to get just about whatever you want in as little time as possible.
---
Lmao everyone's salty.
---
Yeah it sucks big time. Especially after the bullion grind to be able to purchase it. I was all excited to use it, and bam, doesn’t even work.
---
Bet you just came from nuclear winter?
---
Its a visual bug, first time I saw it confused me.
---
Do you have to stay in to the end of the match? I got it once but I want sure how, but didn't get it at all today
---
SS Underarmor  
---
15DR/15ER/15RR  
---
4 Strength  
---
2 Perception  
---
4 Endurance.
---
250 bullion for the underarmor plan  
---
200 bullion for the Shielded Lining plan.
---
I did! I had no idea this was a big and was very concerned
---
Squad maneuvers (faster movement in groups), strange in numbers, action boy, travel agent, grenadier, or travel agent are my go to perks
---
I almost choked on my chips lol
---
It's supposed to be grindy. Like I said in my post even the most hard to keep items like lead and flux take me an hour to grind out hundreds. 
---
It's supposed to be grindy but if you play right the grind is trivial. The hardest grind I've faced since launch is the wastelanders reputation missions.
---
Its better in the open, my first was in the same place and stuck between the trees.
---
Literally look at the top posts of the last 24 hours and none of them are calling for violence against devs and all that, they are doing exactly what you're talking about. They are asking politely, you're just choosing to ignore those and only talk about the fucked up ones (which I don't support) to further your point.
---
Wait this can happen? Also is there a way to kill the mothman?
---
The sink completed my bathroom
---
It’s a shame that the season issues are overshadowing teams.  It’s actually a handy system and would have been great a year ago, or with some other form of chat.
---
Sadly I’m only seeing about a 50 perk card sharing rate.  People need to share!
---
FINALLY FIXED IT!!! Give me a few mins to upload a new version.
---
Update: Done. Please try the new version at the same link. Works fine for me.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3bgy1/psa_intelligence_increases_xp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb
---
Yeah.
---
Exactly what underarmor is this modifying.  I swear I got every one of them and I dont see it as a option on any 'underarmor'     
---
edit: NVM figured it out... gotta love a misclick..
---
Normal for more useful stuff and communist for the memes
---
I'm level 2 after 48 hours of doing dailies and launching a nuke and playing for maybe 3 hours doing random whatever. I hate the new system because my idea of fun isn't checking off stupid arbitrary random tasks. This is the only thing that has made me consider cancelling fo1st after being subbed since the beginning because even with this patch my will to keep trying is fading.
---
I was real big into trading + camp design, the market discord is dead (has been since vending was disabled in may) and the numbers hovered briefly at 13k earlier today before dropping back to 7-8. 
---
Send help, morale is low.
---
No and I never found any but I ran Lucky Hole Mine several times a day where I usually get 1-4 handmades and scrapped them. I currently am missing 1 more mod.
---
I feel the same. Gives me a new sense of purpose in the game. I don't really care about atom shop stuff, I saved most of mine and just recently decided to buy stuff for my camp. I played the tea time event and there were 10 people there. Not even week 1 was there 10 people at that event.
---
My spacebar gonna be broken at some point with that much spamming
---
Thanks man, I just got buttressed for the arms and legs, underarmor, and shielded lining. They're definitely more worth it over the jetpack in my opinion
---
Awesome 🥳  
---
Good luck on your future crafting rolls!
---
I just want "repair all" to become "repair everything I have the resources to fix at the moment"
---
ammo converter does suck haha
---
&gt; TL:DR Can we at least give the season a full week to see what level we are at before we judge an entire 10 week challenge.
---
No, we can't. What sub do you think you're on? Only reactionary, base opinions are allowed to be recognized to the front page. We need to extrapolate the results of the first 2 days to the entire three month season otherwise we might risk not being able to get upset about something our opinions were already set on before any experience.
---
Stg somebody's gonna take that seriously so I need to preface it's not. My biggest concern is that half the posts claiming it's impossible are A) incapable of basic calculations, B) assuming that all 100 ranks follow the same pattern we see in the first 5 ranks, and C) discounting how much the exp score will add up over time. Also the classic r/fo76 case of spending more time complaining than playing the game
---
Idk. I get all my daily challenges done in about 90 minutes. And I'm not really trying. Tyou could do it in an hour.... so sorry?
---
For a full health build, Junkies offers the biggest damage boost.  For Junkies, each addiction adds 10% boost up to a max of 50% (5 addictions).  Choose addictions carefully since each has negative effects...you want to pick the five that will hurt the least.  Once addicted you don’t have to maintain the affects, just leave it alone.  So pretty simple really.  
---
The biggest damage boost comes from low health and Bloodied weapons.  Low health builds are fun...they just require management skills.  Some players enjoy it, others don’t.  Once you’ve tried a bloodied minigun you won’t go back, though.
---
YES. ESO also has dailies that you just log in to get. No grind.
---
I was like finally lol idk even know where I got mine
---
I’ll try that as well then. Thank you! Just a struggle lol.
---
Unfortunately because the 2 additional  points in charisma is a waste of special points.
---
Ye and such a variety ! Plus events related to em and always something good.
---
Why does this sound like they want us to treat this like a job? Did no-one tell Bethesda quarantine is lifting for many of us, and we have actual jobs to go back to now?
---
In other games, missing a single daily doesn't feel like anything bad because much like when the dailies would say (1/3) but list 10 things, if you didn't get all 10 things that is okay. You can still get the rewards.  
---
Here, knowing that just missing one or two in these next two months could make it impossible to beat the run, it's demoralizing and feels like there is no respect for my time as a player.
---
You can use photomode or the PA clip to go straight to the final room. It's been around for a while. Frequent queen killers probably haven't done a legitimate silo run since early last year
---
I was getting +1int bonus while being alone (noone teams with lvl 5 lol) so game might think u in team for sure
---
I question whoever thought "yeah, this is a good idea" seems like a lot of things were pawned off to the intern that doesn't know what they're doing. Was probably the same guy that did the ammo converter.
---
You can quit match after you die. It takes varying amounts of xp to unlock the various items. A hair over 27 k tk get all of them
---
Why only for a meme? My character is a Chinese spy lol
---
Same im just tired of doing the same exact stuff and everything being this tedious grind for a cosmetic. There's no substance here. If i was a new player this would be awesome as it would gel perfectly but im bored and old and adding fetch quests and disguising it as some exciting new update is bullshit and im not falling for it.
---
Yeah but when you have a build focused on something its hard to spare a point for that
---
Well uh, there’s always the lifetime challenges.
---
If you mash the pickup button while picking up bobby pins, you can sometimes pick up as many as 30, especially on a laggy server (I got 59 once).
---
I gave my new character 10000 bobby pins to start the game (from another character) ... 7 days later he had 10000 caps from selling to a vendor, without having to sell anything else.  Started Wastelanders with a HUGE advantage due to no need for cap grind.
---
If you are looking for things to benefit you, that capitalize on game glitches.
---
I really like it but i want it to get fixed it titally matches the military aspect of my guy im trying to get the seen so hopefull bethesda will do something
---
I get where you're coming from but the lack of social options and barely any focus on creating your own story makes it hard to not grind.
---
They're called lifetime for a reason. You complete them, you're done.
---
I don't know about that though. If you play solo sometimes then you want lone wanderer for the survivability. If you are playing on a team you definitely want the benefits of inspirational since 15% xp is really good for just 2 perk points. I have 2 characters who have pretty narrow builds and I literally have never had a situation where I would rather the 2 perk points somewhere else, because the charisma perks are very useful for different situations.
---
Insulting people and inciting violence is wrong and people who do it should be banned. Voicing my feelings about feeling wronged over and over and over again after legit spending hundreds of dollars while watching something I enjoy immensely be slowly tanked for what appears to be very vain reasons is why the complaints are so consistent across every community forum/discord/official forum I have seen so far. Even the people in-game who dont have access or care about any of this are bitching.
---
Maybe people are confused because some challenges are to complete  an x amount of events.
---
What level is your highest character and what exactly are you enjoying about the new content?
---
The real question: what else are you using your gold on and what else are you using your scrip on?
---
Was wondering if you could explain what new content was actually released? And what level your highest character is
---
The race for presidency has been postponed due to bugs and errors in testing
---
You do understand; the rewards won’t  keep going this fast? Lol?
---
I would love higher gear cap. A level 50 shouldn’t be equal to me. A level 100, that’s fine, they put in at least a little effort
---
So far only one random person has had a mic or was willing to use it.  The rest were silent and wouldn’t even use emotes when asked questions.  I have no problem sharing a perk card, just ask.  I try to be helpful, even willing to share mutation serums and such....you guys just have to turn on a mic and be social.
---
Try it out!  Science!  Who cares if it's a month old, good to see posts are still read.
---
Since I’ve got the gauss minigun as well, I haven’t planned to buy anything else and I spend scrip on lengdary modules (For gauss minigun rolls) and 3 star legendary guns
---
Was hoping for that too. Grinded skeleton during the first event, then they extended it and now its reintroduced along with the xmas stuff (only cared to get up to the tree before) I dont mind others getting the stuff later when I grinded my arse off for in the alotted timeframe, would just love the same opportunity for the VTU stuff.
---
I will patiently wait fir this on my feed.
---
I got this sequence from the lower half of the binary code set: vruf h38¬v wfdwqrf
---
I have no idea what it means, but I typed each 0 and 1 into at least 2 translators with the same result, so it must be something. IDK for sure tho
---
Once again I beg to differ I have 2 characters with builds that can crush end game content and I have never felt so constrained that I couldn’t put 2 points into charisma. Maybe you’re just not looking at the cards in charisma completely, but there are some nice perks like tenderizer and suppressor which can really be useful to increase damage with tenderizer and suppressor is very nice to lower the damage output of hard hitting mobs.
---
I found this hilarious when it first came out :D
---
Simple fix in my opinion is do what Rockstar did with the RDR2 Online Outlaw Pass. 100 ranks, all require 1,200 XP. Never goes up and it's doable for almost anyone.
---
I use the communist one as it gives bloodpacks so I can craft stimpacks.
---
I hate it when you loot a bunch of stuff and 10 minutes later you have to mash B like 20 times because all the shit that is aggressively shoving itself in your face. "Hey, remember that Nocturnal rolling pin? How about that hunters combat knife, or those treasury notes?". Ugh.
---
I think the point being is that 1 crop while plentiful if you have a ton of the same crop growing, is annoying to go out and constantly pick more of when fertilizer is plentiful and can be made out of spoiled materials. Most people are literally rolling in the shit(fertilizer)
---
What do you mean I can't play monster reborn?!!!
---
I've had stuff disappear. Not armor, yet, but my imposters helmet disappeared from one of my characters inventory. That's the only thing I've noticed, though.
---
Upvotes are garuanteed for any post with this request, we all want it, badly 😂 Bethesda pls.
---
Hey I was there for that! Gladiator suit with the mole miner fist. I couldnt believe it either, I hope that's how it will be from now on!
---
Has anyone done the math if you stack 3 queens over and over which is better ?
---
Yeah I think a lot of people join for the random bonuses that each team gives, but I really don’t think people understand that you can get a lot of useful utility perks with perk sharing. You also can level up much faster with inspirational if everyone shares even just rank 1 of it.
---
That's the point though, they want you to spend money because they know full well some of us cant play every day.
---
Yeah, I honestly enjoy the game, but when I take a step back, its really only fun during the double/triple xp events. Those always bring back DROVES of us and the game is lively again, I don't like this game enough to grind this shit every day, and the fact that if i only play 2-3 times a week i might not hit rank 50, let alone rank 100, yeah fuck that, unless they announce triple score/xp weekend schedule asap before this ends. They've fucked us over too much since launch. Every step in the right direction comes with two shitty steps back
---
It goes up by 25 each level. Haven't heard from anyone on what it caps out at.
---
Hey, I didn’t say it was a *good* way...
---
Score is also given after events when you finish the weekly challenge for example “complete 5 events on a team” you don’t even have to be with your team. Join a random open one. Clear a workshop (1 event done). Wait for the defend workshop (2 events done)
---
I have a spare one if you decide to go upmarket and install a guest bathroom!
---
It is hilarious that at 39%, VATS hits 75% of the time, and at 95%, if you get caught in a glitch, it misses 95% of the time.
---
It has to do with the BROKEN RNG mechanics of the game, that minimize every probability below the advertised amounts, and get stuck when too many calculations are being done simultaneously on a server, the game cheats by repeating outcomes rather than calculating new ones (hence why dupers can use crashing servers to duplicate items)
---
Yeah but there are better cards to pick from other than travel agent and hard bargain
---
Just hold reload till you put it away. Then press fire button to bring it back out. Annoying but it works
---
I might extend my house a bit been thinking about, bro if been grinding whitesprings for the last 2 hours for the exp deal iv done it maybe 1 or 2 times and have just recieved a decent 3 star vampires explosive 25 ap reduced 10mm
---
Also if it’s really that much of a waste I would love to see the build you’re running because I assure you tenderizer can squeeze more damage than you think and things like demo expert are not worth all 5 points because of how bethesda implemented. You may not run demo expert specifically, but many of the perks bethesda has in the game don’t work the same way they appear on the card and it might be worthwhile to look into that.
---
Sounds fun! 👍
---
Cave Crickets and those floating bullshit alien things.
---
Right there w you
---
The side of the mount also blocks part of the ejection port. You can easily tell the modeling was done by artists without much experience with weapons.
---
I would love to, but considering how they treated the bow you might want to lower your expectations.
---
If you don't have the minigun you want yet,  that sounds good. I, for one,  hate buying 3 star guns bc I always get crap. So I'd rather buy modules. 
---
If you are a power armor almost all the time guy,  then wait until your minigun is where you want.
---
I would say yes since it has the best dr er and rr on armor pieces in the game
---
Does Inspirational stack?  I thought you only received the one?
---
People getting 500exp per supermutants now with herbivore, so its 20 max lvl kills to get 10k exp (gonna be 1k per kill if use 4 lunchboxes in a party, crazy)
---
Collection easy, the food cooler is not that good
---
Its still worth a try and they also fixes the libert prome pa by choosing whether you can disable voice lines
---
Look up photomode zoom glitching, there's two doors you do it on which makes the part to get to the control room take about 5 minutes tops including grabbing the biometric key.
---
knowing it was coming dosent change the fact it sucks
---
If it stays 25 per level,  there are 98 levels after the first since we started going from 1 to 2. So from 2 to 3... etc there are 98 levels. So 98x25=2450 plus the original thousand, so to get from 99 to 100 will likely take 3450. Other posts have the total math for 1 to 100 combined.
---
Did you even read my comment? I was talking about cards that are overall DPS increasers rather than utility cards like hard bargain and travel agent. Tenderizer is a very powerful damage perk in charisma and unlike cards like glow sights it applies all the time rather than just a specific enemy type.
---
Implement a way for player created quests
---
Mathematics is a plural. Therefore maths.
---
229, anything new to do is fine by me as long as it’s free
---
Yes it does stack. I run rank three on my own and I see a good jump in XP when someone shares a rank of it.
---
they want ppl to use macros
---
^ This. The food cooler takes up budget as welll with whatever you put inside
---
Because everything about NW has been made worse with this update.
---
I have 2 characters that both only have 2 pts in charisma, so I can’t share anything. But when am on different ones, I always share, often share inspirational just for extra xp.
---
It's useful if you make complicated foods for buffs. It allows you to make a batch, store some for the next play session and keep some on you. Otherwise, yeah it's more of a decoration.
---
Definitely Collectron. The value added isn't even comparable tbh.
---
Do you find anything in this patch actually enjoyable or improves the gameplay?
---
Honestly, good on you for getting out of this abusive relationship we call a game. I'm still playing, and while I still enjoy the game it has major flaws that bother me as well. Bullion grinding in itself doesn't bother me, it's the limitations and the fact that they incentivize logging in daily to redeem your 20 Treasury Bonds a day instead of making it a weekly limitation of like 1400, which would make people who don't have access to the game on a daily basis have a lot more freedom. The end game is laughable, the economy with these endgame items is laughable too. If someone's bought the rights, the entitlements to these weapons themselves, they should be able to trade for the items as well given they have all the necessary mods unlocked. I feel like I got cheated with the gauss pistol, why can't I sell it to someone else who wants a bloodied gauss pistol and can't get one themselves because they have bad rng?
---
12. 3. 2. 3. 13. 13. 9
---
Ok thank youu
---
I think I just found my soul mate or twin. Keep fighting the good fight comrade. It’s a shame I’m on PC
---
F
---
Not a bug, just poor coding/math. I have a bunch of 90% weapons and armors still weight 8 lbs without any mods, it’s laughable to think my vanilla gauntlet would weigh 80 lbs, that’s a whole mole miner lol
---
How many points of demo expert are worth it?
---
These are not the kinds of issues that should slipping through
---
Does someone know when the colossel problem event will become available?
---
lunch boxes have weight and are non trade-able you can not save them to use them at a good time, if you dont have the space to save them
---
same with floater grenades 
---
visual glitch trying to load a floater grenade in to a shotgun lol
---
I can't believe they still don't have moddable servers.
---
the game will be cancelled before they get around to it.
---
My experience as well.  My buddy and I were mowing down the Colasus a couple days ago...much more of a fight now.  Wendigos aren’t dropping much loot, certainly no flux materials.
---
I'm only lvl. 75 so I haven't really come close to the burnout feeling that lvl. 100+ players/multiple character players have yet, but I can definitely see the end game becoming tedious. I'm still having fun and I'm glad I joined in late cause I probably would've been bored with the launched version. I didn't have much hope for Bethesda and their plans, but they have turned the game around from the disaster it once was. They won't be able to please everybody and frankly, I don't even think they'll truly try. I bought it on sale through Steam and just cancelled my 1st sub since I only wanted the Ranger outfit and wanted to try out unlimited scrapbox. Damn, I'll miss that scrapbox :(
---
The best bang for your buck is 2 points. Beyond that you get diminishing returns.
---
Yes, i have something new to do and I haven’t run into any game breaking bugs or glitches whatsoever so the gameplay has remained enjoyable for me
---
Ghillie light wood laminate.
---
Stealth melee?
---
What are the new things to do?
---
It’s the same events/quests.  Just presented in a different way.
---
So, you *dont want to spend your time on a game* (your quote), but you want endgame rewards lol. If you dont want to play, why even bother about rewards. Same in other MMOs, endgame rewards requires grind, you either do it, or dont bother (PvP rank in wow classic for example)
---
Saying that challenges are hard and grindy now...they made them several times easier. Ive done weekly-daily in like 2 hours top and hit rank 10 in a first day and you are supposed to hit rank 10 in a first WEEK (event continues for 10 weeks). People getting crazy exp with buffs (500-1000 or even more) per max lvl supermutants
---
It's honestly fun, most of the time people aren't fightning but rather hiding, the fun comes when you kill someone hiding that has nothing in them.
---
Yea just teeth, screws and fiberglass or something, no mass or fluids or other gears. Someone was bragging he could farm a shit ton of materials from those spawns, apparently Bethesda read it lol
---
As far as I’m aware, there is no official narrative - but there are plenty of fan made ones.
---
Because of the second/third star not being the same, you may have overestimated the amount of possible rolls. For example explosive only ever shows up in the second slot and bash damage can be either second or third slot.
---
Either way, there is likely some type of weighting to the system. Unyielding pieces of secret service armor for example drop much less frequently than other types. So figuring out the exact numbers would be impossible without server side datamining. 
---
But yeah, the odds of getting the exact roll you want are slim to none. But you can often get something good enough until something better comes along. I rolled a junkies limb damage 50cal from the queen which carried me until I found the FFR one I use now. It would be nice if it was also frr instead of vats or something but it's good enough.
---
Depends on how much scrap you have stored away, if you are low, normal. If you have plenty of scrap, communist.
---
No, it absolutely does.
---
You can easily test this by using the Missile Silo State Holotape.
---
The time it takes to load up the silo information is a great way to gauge the speed of the server.
---
Your strain on the server can be quantified by the number of lines in your inventory (like the All items tab in the stashbox).
---
Each time you perform an action that affects that list, the entire list gets read and updated. What happens in the Ammo machine? You constantly update your list for each buy and sell. Because the terminal selectively toggles options based on what you have, it is reading your inventory on each screen. Having a long list of items causes this to load slower and slower.
---
This might not be the case for most games, but it is what happens under the 76 hood.
---
This isn't a safeguard, it is a way to spam the server.
---
Thanks for the post. See ya!
---
I was stuck in a public team and couldn’t get out of it!
---
The Gatling gun skin is pretty cool as is the bloody hand gas mask. If I can get those I'll be happy. The level 100 rewards are meh.
---
Steal that water. That'll show 'em.
---
Thanks hopefully I'll be able to pick up a couple tomorrow
---
Can you explain what exactly you have to do to share perk cards? I tried earlier but it said something about 3 points in charisma, I don’t quite understand how to do it
---
I‘m almost level 190 and I‘ve never seen a person with mic on.
---
I feel like charged shots do better dos against the queen than uncharged rapid shots, idk tho, I rip good sized chunks out of her hp with charged shots.
---
Good to know. Sad I invested 4
---
I def wouldn't say every event, but with publicn teams it's making events more noticeable and is making me and my gf participate more.
---
Yes I am thrilled about it!
---
The event teams are amazing
---
Best thing out of the update
---
Hmmmm..no.
---
Not the charming one, are ya?
---
It is
---
I was going to guess about 1/100,000.  So I was close?
---
Same thing happened to me I logged in to get the score challenge and haven't played in ages and had 100 plus packs! I had no idea what was going on!
---
Alright I'm quiting fallout
---
The game gets Tons of hate, but I still freaking play it. Not sure why, I have nothing to do but daily quests. Somehow, I still find it fun rolling down the road boppin to Mr Sandman
---
Resistance numbers doesnt mean much in this game. Only %.
---
Who needs charm when you got... ummm better stop there as it's a family friendly sub :p
---
Hold your horses big boy!
---
A single article about a rumored buyout from 4 years ago that as far as I know never actually happened? Compelling indeed.
---
YOU DONT WANT TO GO TO VAULT 77
---
DO NO GO THERE, HE WILL FIND YOU
---
AND THEN HE GONNA KILL YOU.....
---
THE PUPPET MAN
---
I would say that if you do all challenges in the first week (daily and weekly) you should get to at least level 20. I've done all the dailies for today and yesterday, except for NW, and about 75%of this weeks weekly, and I'm at level 9. Even with the xp scaling I think you should be able to get 3 or so levels a day.
---
its okay when you level up click demo expert and then when it asks if you want to combine it to get rank 5 just hit no and you will have a rank 1 version which you can chose to rank up when highlighting the level 1 perk to easily get level 2. I thought you had to do that so I wasted 7 level ups to get a rank 2 version lol
---
How can people defend this sort of things?
---
Xbox
---
Bc game is loading shadows on trees across the map and you or someone on the server has an inventory that takes 6 minutes to scroll through.
---
Bloodied assault rifle, even a one star, can be fun.  Not as powerful as handmade or combat rifles, but still fun.  I use mine when I’m looking for more of a challenge.  
---
The radium rifle, that’s another story.  Either scrip or store it away on a mule - you never know, they may make it viable one day.
---
I'm not okay because Bethesda's statement: 'You could earn it by playing normally.' No, dude, I have to play for it to earn it.
---
If you can't get SS underarmor then go with Marine underarmor.
---
That was my main though. They can't do a correct UI to work with the converter buy HEY, PRESS HERE, SPIN IT!
---
we need this  with all crafting, a sliter to display 1-maximum craftability would be nice
---
I agree. I admit it took me 2 days to get to lvl 8 but that really isn't bad at all and there is still WEEKS to go. I think this is working out just fine.
---
I like the game so Legendary Run or no, I'm going to pay until it stops being fun.
---
Pvp is still in the main game. The only thing that is gone is the ability to force the entire team to pvp if only one person tries to. I fail to see your issue with it, as it should cut down on the griefers.
---
I unlocked it yesterday and I haven't placed it in my camp, after seeing quite a few people talk about it.
---
Usually I investigate things on my own and come to my own conclusions, but with this I don't know want to find out for myself. Mainly because when I heard about it before the update hit. I was a bit excited to have a better solution to harvest fuel.
---
Here's hoping it gets a swift fix. I commend everyone to voice your opinions about this.
---
yeah so its simple you need three points of charisma for every rank of the perk that you wanted to share. So for example if I wanted to share strange in numbers which is a perk in charisma that has only 1 rank as its max you would only need to have the perk equipped and have three points in charisma. However if you had a rank 5 version of adrenaline and you wanted to share that perk you would need to have all 15 points in charisma and the adrenaline perk equipped to share that perk. Make sense?
---
I dont think I would even use all the cosmetics. I guess I’d like to have the secret door fireplace but it’s not the end of the world!
---
I get that and I'm just floating a compromise for pvpers who are gonna miss the old way.
---
Nice so I have three more things on each list to grind for.
---
(F*ck this hot garbage game mode... I can’t wait to get this stuff so I can go back to adventure mode.)
---
Idk. The button smashing throws me off.. plus with all the ammo I trade in I only get 100 of the ammo I really need.. so honestly don’t think it’s very useful.. I’d rather craft it.
---
Because 76 was never intended to be entered again. It states in the lore that it was the one vault they didn't do weird experiments on, and they intended the people in it to repopulate and fix Appalachia.
---
Upvoted because fanbois that doesn't care just fanboying downvote. You are right.
---
That’s a opinion, not one I agree with but it is one
---
They had them on the atom shop for weeks on end.
---
Agreed.
---
No not the communist spy outfit
---
**500+ hours? Jesus Christ.**
---
Not much makes sense about Vault 76. Those entrances are usually safely away from the surface, but this one is right there at the top of a hill where it'll take maximum damage.
---
&gt; Yea but I think the point is unless you play every day to complete dailies you can’t get to level 100.
---
Yeah, I covered that when I said "So it makes it impossible for people who can’t play everyday reach the finish line during the season."  
---
People who play more are going to get more rewards.  No sense in complaining about that, as that is the way it should be.
---
That terminal looks like shit. The art team is probably fuming at the CK moron who slapped the terminal on it because he was too dumb to copy/paste the Scrip machine interface
---
Just put more repeatable SCORE rewards.
---
Math.
---
Good observation skills. 😊
---
I like how people answer the best one is SS underarmor without knowing your build. For sneak use Raider +3agi.
---
I do my best!
---
I wouldn't pay for the solution to the problem they made.
---
You'll end up around lvl 12-13
---
It is, just bought yesterday and freak out with stats. If only it was INT instead of RES XDDDDDD
---
You would be surprised I am level 253 on my main and I find that if I use my mic to see if people want to communicate most of the time I get atleast one of them to talk back too. Im on PC so maybe its just the PC player base but that is my experience. I also told bethesda that we need a text chat for people who either don't like to use their mics or don't have one in the first place. It would really help with communication and if you're on PC I highly recommend using the text chat mod its very nice to talk to people since it spans all servers.
---
Even when me and my teammates barely interact it just makes me feel way less lonely. My favorite addition so far tbh
---
With these sort of things, it's best not to compare to other methods, like yes, you get more by crafting it, but this or for all the random scrap crap you have on you already, hat you unwillingly received for an event or whatever. Definitely beats waiting for someone to buy it or just throwing it away. 😄👍
---
Ticket
---
Almost at Level 9 in the first two days, not bad for now, lets see how i can keep the pace up as the days pass. I got work and other stuff going on, so i really can't put that many hours everyday. I just wanna make it to 88 for the Cosmos Power Armor Skin and I'll be happy
---
Yeah, I know, I’m just saying that’s the preferable alternative to the grind. Not like they listen to us anyways.
---
Using jetpack is more like lagging, not flying.
---
Community event.
---
Jumanji 2 unofficially.
---
Yeah it's not too bad. I button mash through it too.
---
Let us do more at a time and it'd be fine.
---
These are the items they held off on adding to the Survivor Nuclear Winter Challenge.
---
Just like that Future-Tek camp was pulled from the bundle.
---
We're going to be seeing lots of things that were omitted from other bundles real soon.
---
Wait for the Blood Eagles bundle. They've already made skins for each weapon and armor. You can see the blood eagles wear the blood eagle metal armor and power armor skins in game. They'll just be released incrementally over the next 2 years.
---
Pretty sure the point limit is to make sure that you can't just turn all unused ammo into points instead of having it take up space in your stash
---
If you go to the atlas observatory you can see 2 construction protectrons (or more. Only seen the 2) already building up fortifications around the observatory. There's also a note in one of the tents. Its called "be back in a bit" highly recommend to go and look around the area. Haven't checked inside the observatory cause I didn't have enough time until I had to leave for work. Will look at it later though :)
---
While we’re talking crops, can ‘wild blackberries’ become ‘blackberries?’ Seriously, I shouldn’t have to scroll all the way through my menu for a snack that’s named strangely.
---
I had to sacrifice my 9 charisma for perks for my bloodied build, can’t share perks because my charisma is too low. 
---
(Also it may not be intentional, when you swap around perk cards and remove some it stops sharing it, most the time people forget to click the share button again.)
---
Same here, it’s still the best shotgun for enemies like scorchbeast queen imo but I’m still kinda sad.
---
Damn. WTF.
---
Yeah honestly the menu is a little confusing and the quantity is a little time consuming, but really can't complain with the results! 😄
---
Just like XP, each level up will get longer and longer
---
Are you sure? Like I said I'm level 9 now after only 2 days, without the 500xp from the two NW challenges, and have done about half the weekly ones. I should hit 12 by tomorrow or early Friday at the latest.
---
Can't disagree :(
---
The only thing I want from the screaming eagles skin is an all black version that maybe looks like the marksmen carbine from new Vegas.
---
(I miss my RU556 assault rifle from Fallout 4.)
---
Is this relevant for any build other than ones based on unyielding or high base intelligence? I've got negative base intelligence because of marsupial so the +4 doesn't seem worth it.
---
I'm repeating myself: THANK YOU BETHESDA!
---
Seeing there's no way of getting through the season without daily grinding for some hours, and seeing that 90+% of the rewards are things I don't need or can't/won't use, this finally takes some pressure out of the game.
---
I grinded some atoms the last weeks for the occasional good stuff they put in the shop once a month, now there's no need to anymore. I guess I'll do some of the early levels and then I'm back for BOS DLC.
---
Nothing to do + nothing to gain = me playing other games.
---
I spent 200 bullion to get jet pack and I used it at first but then when I rolled my second chest piece and got unyielding armor I did not bother putting it on there. It isn’t worth it to me and I wish I could get my 2000 bullion back
---
That depends on how you feel about mobility. There is something about speed demon, marsupial, bird bones AND a jet pack that is hard to go back from.
---
I get that but this the best thing were gonna get for a while
---
I was in a party when the bomb was launched, I'm lvl 24. Ping it with a rifle still got drops. Hid from enemies but still did what I could, at least you did something unlike others I've seen there.
---
They do or at least did have a group of models that would literally tell the developers how to fix the issue, for free. They even take the time each patch to list issues that are still in the game and ones that may have been introduced, and occasionally post a “bug roundup”. And those same bugs still persist. I believe at one point they invited a handful of said modders to directly talk to the developers towards the beginning of the game. The problem is Bethesda has shown that they don’t care, whether it is the higher ups in the company or the developers themselves, they just don’t care if this game fails. This game is on life support, and unfortunately instead of sealing a successful future of the game wastelanders just delayed the inevitable failure of this game.
---
Yet people already finished it. And some folks were complaining it takes too much time
---
To quote a scholar, “don’t hate the player, hate the game”.
---
Lol tf u me a best not to compare methods?? U get ammo regardless.. the thing is u get so little ammo from events that u can’t trade it in... u need to save up and when u got no storage space in ur camp it seems useless; when u could literally craft it with super duper and the ammo perk...
---
Mathematically speaking, if you make it to 97, it's worth buying the rest of the levels if you can't otherwise grind them, since the last level alone gives 500 atoms and you'll get the 450 back. ;)
---
What kind of weapon do you use for bloodied? My builds I posted in the update are both bloodied since its the best damage build atm and I run 4 or 5 depending on the build.
---
\# #savesavetheworld EPIC is a multi-billion dollar company, just killed off their PvE gamemode, the original mode that got them off the ground with some finances so they could CREATE BR and become a titan. A multi-billion dollar company can't afford , with the amount of fucking revenue they make in a month, to spend a chump change to keep the game updated with simple, fun, and unique content like dungeons or storm king compare dto the crazy WACKY shit they do in BR every season, in some cases every WEEK. 
---
Bethesda.....well. Let's just say every single patch FO76 doesn't get unique content , but instead more grind, it looks worse and worse for the game. If FO76 doesn't start making them money soon, # saveFO76 will soon trend when Bethesda announces they are "slowing development". That is, if that doesn't already happen in a year or two as we get closer to Starfield's release and they have to dedicate more resources to that. 
---
Bethesda and Epic, like two peas in a rotting pod.
---
I’ve always found ammo to be annoying in fallout games - especially having to check which gun takes which ammo before crafting by navigating the clunky, clunky menus!
---
After all that effort building the world, simple things like simple, usable interfaces have let them down big time!
---
Almost everytime I've seen the argument of "give Bethesda a chance to fix it" nothing changes.
---
I love this game but I'm sick of making excuses for it amd the devs.
---
It gives you useless communist  flyers along with the junk and stuff but the flyers take up space that could be used for other stuff
---
I haven't noticed this at all. I've been hitting whitesprings golf club and West tek all day to grind for XP, and ive always got 1-3 legendaries per location.
---
I'm fine with the system but they need to cut it down some , not all people have enough time to do all dailies everyday for next two months let alone the extra 10000 xp you'd need to complete it, I personely want the item right before last item, but I'll never have the time to complete it that far, flat out either numbers required need squished down or extend the time period , every other game a season lasts quarter of a year and usualy can be completed in half that time if u grind every day or all 4 if you can only do it half the week
---
Probably with having so many atoms isn't that you're gaining too many, it's that instead of releasing the 50GB of backlog content, they keep bringing back the same shitty bundles over and over again.
---
Big update? The last one was wastelands. remember that patch 20 had a lot of content cut
---
If you can't fast travel do to the bug, move about 30ft and it almost always fixes itself for me.
---
The rep grind is truly painful. There's no reason have it be this long except padding player activity to impress investors.
---
I like the fool cooler ;)
---
Well people already finished it so... they definitely ran through it
---
I'd love playing it as a stand alone single player so I wouldn't have to deal with server issues/maintenance, but I know it would still be a glitchy Bethesfest which is okay but in an online environment it is a bit more irksome because of the economy aspect.   I enjoy the game but settlement building really needs work, weapon and item glitches are so common, damage issues happen all the time, AI pathing is hilariously bad but cheesing a hard enemy is kinda fun in it's own way (classic bethesda) I'm not a fan of how a company needs to scheme for $ when in the past companies would just make a good game and sell copies...that was it.  Make a sequel or add some DLC if it was really popular.   
---
It's like rolling a rock down a mountain, it's fun, it may cause damage, it's kinda pointless and it takes a lot of energy to get that rock back up if you need it.
---
The idea is fine and all but doesn't this then come down to who has the most broken gear?
---
Maybe it's just me but that sounds about as unfun as the fast travel campers from Survival mode.
---
Every fight is Radom.
---
Yes, after second day it's indeed XP reward popping up, no event reward. Maybe I was seeing delayed one previously indeed that get me too optimistic. :D
---
I finally got to NW rank 100 so im ready to grind, besides i feel like people are astounded when they see high levels. xD
---
I've done it three times over the past couple days, works perfectly for me.
---
Was just in an event where everybody was opening lunchboxes left and right. Got the confetti effect for the first time and I love it. I wonder if it also increase your damage like bloody mess does?
---
So I ran across idk 30 or 40 legendaries 3 star but only got like 3 or 4 3-star which is pretty disappointing, didnt even pick the 1 and 2 stars up due to weight issues
---
Both Christmas and Halloween items are unlocking. Unfortunately the VTU set isn't.
---
Watch the new trailer. You see a map screen with Lvl 1000 Bobblehead_Joe sitting on 48k Atoms and at 4000 CW fat walking.
---
Later we see Bobblehead_Joe moving at normal speeds during Line in the Sand featuring Nuclear Winter weather.
---
My A button is actually worn down from picking so much material. Of course this may have been contributed playing other games, but most of them I only press A every so often lol.
---
Ah I think I can share rank 2 perks but most of my perks are rank 3 or higher. Currently hiding in a bush in NW so I can’t check at the moment.
---
I like it, i got rid of so many unwanted ammo and got a nice ammount of 5mm ammo for my Gatlinggun back.
---
Uh isn't that what we have right now...
---
Also you earn the same skin several times for armor you don't use.
---
Apparently u can still get the Ghillie suit from NW... just to let u know...
---
Thanks for this. I wish people would just calm the fuck down and play the game. I love hyperbolic commenting as much as anyone else, but this sub takes it to a whole new level. Stuff is broken, it will get fixed, it's not the end of the world.
---
I am reminded of the saying 'opinions are like a-holes, everyone's got one and they all stink..."
---
I was able to solo Radiation Rumble today because the turrets glitched and they were invincible turrets doing the same damage as the assaultron laser spam :D
---
My interpretation of this statement:
---
&gt; You will begin “The Legendary Run” at Rank 1, and you can advance your position on the board by earning S.C.O.R.E. through your Daily and Weekly Challenges. These include **completing Public Events** and leveling up your character. 
---
Is that you earn SCORE from challenges, and THESE CHALLENGES include completing public events. To my understanding it doesn't necessarily mean you get SCORE from every single event you complete, but I hope I'm wrong and this is just a bug or something.
---
That sounds fun challenge accepted
---
Thanks for explaining that, I was trying to share a rank 3 perk so that’s why it wasn’t working. Strange in numbers is so awesome, I finally got to try it just now
---
I feel like when she is in the air and I land a Crit headshot it causes her to do an animation. I have always thought that animation might keep her from landing.
---
I just shitpost the PTS and collect my warnings.
---
I datamine and provide the fixes step by step. 100% ignored.
---
I mean the ~5x conversion rate is probably enough. It wouldn't really be practical for players to lose ~80% of their ammo just so they could stash it for free.
---
I cant pvp in adventure mode because of players using vats, drugs, op armor/ op guns, and also because my character is just a mule. So i prefer to play nuclear winter because it's pretty fair.
---
I like it has potential
---
then a skyrim intro
---
Yeah, I got that, exiting PA allows you to actually use it again. 
---
Tbh, I won’t be using the ammo converter much, the UI is terrible.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks for that, it was only on that page not on my receipt. I'm in the UK &amp; I was charged in pounds sterling so hopefully that means it's ok.
---
Not really. I hate NW... I die within 2 minutes of being in there (I suck at PvP and I don't see any reason why to get better when I don't enjoy it) and all it is for me is a big exercise in frustration and not fun. My friend who hates PvP even more than me (occasionally in GTA at least if I am super bored I'll go in a public server and wait for some one to start something with me but I get bored within 15 minutes usually) tried yesterday and lasted maybe 5 minutes and said fuckit, I'm not doing that. And I think he's more ready to put the game down than me over this. Some of us really, really, really don't enjoy that kind of gameplay. And it's BS that Bethesda is trying to force those to play that mode when it is a very different mode. I personally think either they shouldn't have NW dailies, or they should be "extra" points for those who either enjoy it or are willing to put up with it that can help speed progression a little bit (not required like it is now as you can't skip one daily).
---
I'd agree with you if there wasn't the "spend atoms for levels" option that they are so obviously pushing you towards. It being almost impossible to get without atoms is a feature, not something they're interested in fixing.
---
Giant facts
---
People who share strange in numbers are godsends
---
 thanks for this boss! 
---
haters love haters, and thats probably why the other poster got more likes.
---
drinking too much of that hatorade
---
I never did my challenges before this update. Whatever ones I did were an accident. Now I am aware of the challenges and work then into my routines. The public teams add a little change too. Feels, right now at least, a little less like work than before this patch.
---
Get a job
---
They don't make any demands. There's 0 structure.
---
They just recently gave us a L250 toon to try out L perks because so many came from Xbox (and promptly left).
---
We still have to grind and grovel, while missing out on progressing our accounts (no atomshop, no challenges, no progress)
---
I'm already Rank 13. 
---
Stopped for a while to farm NW XP.
---
I'd probably be almost Rank 15 by now.
---
I’ve died to crickets more than sbq for sure
---
But those are depleted - I think I have only the broken or unrealistic challenges left.
---
Complaining is easy, and a bit fun.
---
Ah, good luck.
---
That's what the subscription service is for.
---
I think this can be normal. Don't know why but after a while low level robots can spawn in rather than the usual ghouls.
---
Same can happen in the glass cavern. Ive been down there twice only to fight low level bots instead of scorched.
---
Same, I don't know why people are so effected by this? You can ignore any quests or challenges you don't want to do it's not a big deal. The rewards really aren't anything that special, and you really aren't missing out on much if you choose to ignore them. Some days I literally just wander around and ignore all the events and dailies bc I simply want to explore. One of the many things I love about Fallout Games is that the game is completely up to you.
---
Ahh that sucks any idea how long it last
---
Agreed! Loving it. If my team is understaffed I start inviting ppl from the map. From the emotes and the likes I think people are appreciating.
---
And PSA if you play solo just join a team! Get those perks.
---
*How dare you* be happy when the rest of us are just looking for excuses to complain in the most unconstructive way possible! 😱
---
Yeah buddy it sucks so much!Tired I am tired to shoot level 1 eye bot 5 times
---
So we can’t currently access ATLAS?
---
What is best in life? Crush your migraines, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of the Emersons Hales.
---
I just meant that Virginia is south, and DC is located within Virginia.
---
there's speculation that later ranks plateau, instead of continually increasing.
---
There's no evidence to support that though.
---
Just... no.  I’ll take the metric system though.
---
It should be flooded, but the BOS apologist fanboys are 'sick of seeing the same thread over and over' and downvote everything to die in New.
---
Yeah apparently u can’t still get the Ghillie suit through NW too.. I don’t play it much but since I found out I’ve been non stop on nw to get the suit...
---
At rank 10 you are about 4-5% to rank 100, not 10%. Every rank requires 25 more score than the previous rank. At the higher ranks you'll need 3000+ score per rank.
---
Queen is 100% and the Colossus is a flat 10%. If you fight the Queen in the nuke zone, chances aren't bad. That'd be a hell of a fight too.
---
It bothers me more that it is a Handmade Skin and not a Combat Rifle/Fixer Skin
---
I say to not compare methods because one is something that is dropped in your lap, the other you have to farm items for.
---
Good on you for having the knowledge of the game to grab both super duper and the ammo perk, but you do realise that a majority of players wouldn't have either of those, right?
---
Side note though: if its taking you 100 bullets to kill ANYTHING excluding the scorchbeast, I think your issue is the gun you're using and not your ammo situation.
---
i did some ini edits to improve gameplay - which it did.  But I had the choice of black water or transparent water. I chose transparent but the black looks ok at Grafton dam I must admit.
---
I did NW yesterday on Steam and the water was clear also.
---
I needed ammo for a 50 cal myself, I'm glad you like it!
---
Ahaha yeah it is a bit unpopular of an opinion huh. There's definitely room for improvement, but as a first step, I think it was an amazing one. 😄
---
We do. The Austin CK team is clueless
---
Really want a whole party sharing it. It gets really fun with marsupial and bird bones lol
---
It's the same thing but with spacebar
---
Yeah, kind of glad this was my introduction to it. Now I’ll somewhat have an idea of what to expect.
---
I haven't seen either way. If it resets at the "warp zones" even I'm not against that. I hit rank 10 in 2 days. It seems to progress "okay" so far. I do need one more level for my weekly, as ive only got level 200 character I don't level every session. So that'll be another rank up too.
---
As someone who also only gets about 2 hours max playtime a day right now, I have already completed every daily challenge for the past 2 days and all the weekly ones. Except for NW challenges and of course there's the repeatable weekly challenge. 
---
It's not impossible, it comes down to if you're willing to put in the time when you can.
---
They literally said that subsequent seasons will have a free tier and a F1st tier.
---
In every mention of the season before release.
---
I guess u farm for items.. u could find scrap material to make ammo literally everywhere.. it’s like “it’s falling on ur lap”
---
And a tse .50 cal isn’t a shit gun; and 100 bullets won’t kill a scorch queen...
---
Either way it’s trash.. ur just crazy about it cause it’s new... eventually ur not even gonna use it watch...
---
I have 1 charisma I cannot share perk cards, it's nice that people do but I'm not about to change my build to share cards.
---
They mean season one of fallout 76. The "seasons" are meant to correspond with the real world seasons time-wise, so right now it's the "summer" season we're playing. They released an image saying what'll be coming for summer, fall, and winter.
---
These are the numbers.  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hji5qp/score\_tracker\_by\_date/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hji5qp/score_tracker_by_date/)   
---
This is the absolute minimum average score per day you require to hit L100 on the final day. If you are behind the points total on any given day, you'll need to increase your pace to catch up if you want to reach 100 before the end.  Every day, you need approx. 76 points of SCORE on top every single daily and weekly challenge. For every challenge you don't complete, you'll need to make that up in repeating the weekly experience challenge.
---
You need to be at least L25 by the time you've finished the weeklies that come out next Tuesday. The first 30 levels are faster than the final 10 levels.
---
I love fake reddit posts
---
It lasts 10 weeks no matter what. Every day he only moves one space. He got a small headstart.
---
If you’re bloodied I 100% recommend radicool and you can share that perk with just 3 points of charisma. It’s such a good perk for bloodied and other bloodied players will thank you for it
---
It is a bummer the whole game is time gated to make you play daily.  I just want to binge on weekends...
---
i think there encouraging ppl to use macros with this ammo converter
---
Yeah, I understand, and I think it's lame, and I don't care to support it.  You can't have a 14 dollar sub that includes a feature that makes playing without it seem kinda terrible (scrap box), PLUS and item shop, then severely nerf the free shop currency, PLUS make a pass system that will force people with regular schedules to pay MORE money if they want to access the new shit.    
---
It's greed on greed on greed, with little so little game play additions added.    
---
It's something I didn't like very much when the game started, paying 60 bucks then locking like 90% of new items added into the game in a year behind a pay wall, THEN adding a subscription, THEN limiting atom intake... yeah.  I just can't support this anymore.    
---
It's not just fo76 that is going down this road more and more, but this is one of the greediest games I've ever played that isn't like a gatcha mobile game.    
---
The most annoying thing is I LIKE this game.  I WANT to play it.  I WANT to believe they want to support it and make the experience more fun rather than just add on more and more and more cash grabs with so little new game play offerings.
---
I finally got the converter...its bad its really bad...  
---
10mm ammo is under energy   
---
the menu is awful why cant I press b to exit I have navigate the menu then hit b on the right one.
---
it already uses a custom currency why cant it use a trade interface...
---
Yeah not a problem. I love that perk so much it makes you feel like a mutant from X-men lol
---
They dont listen bro, all they want to do is make this game so tedious with all these limits.
---
Theres one in the game files based off the one in fo3 for the ar
---
Noticed this too. On the first day, his ship was sitting nearly halfway along the board.
---
My unpopular opinion: The game is better after the patch than it was before, and it was free content. Everyone's maths is wrong. In regards to everything else, people need to learn how to [properly write their constructive criticism](https://personalexcellence.co/blog/constructive-criticism/) to yield the best results - suggest solutions rather than just complaining about the problems, you know? And also be sure to use the [Official Fallout 76 Feedback Form](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42223/~/where-can-i-provide-feedback-for-fallout-76%3F) to ensure it isn't lost in the noise. The feedback forms are [checked thoroughly](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj64mr/i_just_walked_up_here/fwkru23/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) as well.
---
If we show outrage and promote a sense of urgency, we will get half-finished untested content. If we clearly communicate our issues and outline some possible alternatives/solutions, they'd be stupid not to listen 🤷‍♂️
---
We are our own worst enemies, tbh.
---
WEIGHTLIFTING BENCH?
---
Nuclear Winter Weather and Wendigo at Wavy Willard??
---
Bobblehead_Joe running around at 4000 [MAX] CW???
---
Line in the Sand NEW EVENT????
---
It stacks?! I had nooo clue. I thought if one person had it, that was it.
---
lol me too and then it turned into Destiny 2!
---
Wait a sec, lvl 100 gives 500 atoms? How could I've missed it?.. Where did they mention it exactly?
---
Yeah, like any ennemies. But only the vengeful variant can be attacked, the others will just fly away.
---
I feel like they saw how the bush campers in nuclear winter loved it and thought oh wow lets put it on everything. 🤭
---
Nope it stacks and it’s beautiful
---
Yeah I agree, just pointed out the inconsistency of SCORE awards compared to levels. But I agree, after a certain level, you net lots of SCORE ranks just from exp gain alone
---
I genuinely feel dehydrated by how salty you are about this. As though there are no other options, than to only kill scorchbeast queens with your thousands of ammo that you hand crafted yourself.
---
Lol I'm at 600+ hrs. I remember my 1st towvh magazine but my experience wasn't as fun as yours.
---
I absolutely agree on that first statement. However, i disagree that its the devs fault. In my eyes its a projectleader/product owner/management issue on bethesda side.
---
As a Canadian I want to agree, because American English is awful, but as a Fallout fan I have to say you're wrong in this case for one particular reason.
---
The UN in the Fallout universe was disbanded in 2052.
---
If you're a turtle.
---
1 hr for the rest of us including getting side tracked.
---
What is fertilizer even for?
---
Lol honestly i don’t give a shit. Use whatever u wanna use I’m just tell u what ur gonna end up doing later..
---
I don't think it seem ok at all. I'm not asking that it ahve quicker progression. I find it messed up though that first of all you're forced to do the NW daily each day. Given how many people who play this game hate PVP, that's a terrible decision all on its own. I'd put this game down forever if I had to play the PVP part to play it. 
---
Secondly, I really don't think it's too much to ask to be able to skip a few dailys and a few weeklys and still be able to get the progression. It shouldn't feel like you are forced to do stuff you really don't want to to progress (like maybe I don't want to fight the wendigo thing or  hope to luck out that some one drops a bomb where he spawns... and I noticed that is daily or weekly that can come up).  I think either Bethesda should allow events to give score (and maybe depending on how hard the event is determines how much score) or not make the total score requirement require that you get every single daily and weekly. HOnestly, I admit I'd like to be able to skip a few daily weeklys a week (3 or 4 maybe) and one weekly. Sure.. you'll argue that they seem simple, but that was just this week's (and honestly finding legendaries is a bit of luck. I had a really good trick but it seems everyone knows my trick as of this update... seriously, it went from no one knew the trick to now I have to hope to beat people to it cause everyone seems to know it).
---
Look I’m not going to tell you that you’re wrong in doing so, but I’m just saying being in a party of 4 where everyone shares useful perks it really can help loosen up restrictions with only 50 levels worth of perk cards and it’s very nice to get those benefits for the low low price of being in a party with someone.
---
I wholeheartedly second that unpopular opinion.
---
Not supposed but you get score when you gain enough XP (1000 I think?) and it is a repeatable weekly challenge. Probably the events giving score is more a consequence of the XP awarded at the end of an event.
---
Legendary drop rate is normal for me just the other day I went to the white springs and found 3 legendary 3 star ghouls in the main building.
---
The ammo convertor would have been a good thing to add on april 1st, then people would maybe have laughed about it. Now its just a free camp cosmetic item.
---
Praise the CROWD CONTROL! Praise the AOE zoning attacks! Praise the stable interior cell!
---
I totally get what you're saying, but just for the sake of experimentation last night I played around with the converter a bit and I filled it up until 2000 and emptied it making 45 ammo 4 times just clearing my 44 ammo. If I didn't actually need any 45 ammo at the time, that would have been a few dozen pounds of 44 ammo converted into points waiting to be used not taking up space in my storage or on my person. 
---
For people who only use a couple of different types of gun, the potential to abuse converting all of your ammo that you don't need into Infinite storage space to be converted later in to ammo you do need definitely undermines their attempt at artificially restricting our storage
---
For the record I'm not saying it's a good thing that they have done this, only that I understand why they have done it
---
Maybe it's because I was on a private servor
---
I'm sure you'll try.
---
Yea i wish 3 star legendary enemies actually gave guaranteed 3 stars :(
---
Tedious is what Bethesda aims for. More played hours means they can pretend the game is still popular.
---
Oh I'd be loaded right now if that were the case
---
When I refer to the "devs" in this case I'm referring to the whole development process including those making design decisions. So yes, I include the leads and management in my statement.
---
Hmm that might be an issue indeed. I did not finish the story yet and I like to take my time with exploration.
---
If it becomes more an xp race, I’ll just settle for lower final rank. It does not bothet me if I don’t win them all.
---
Isn't that what pvp comes down to anyway? Pvp in this game is poorly implemented but there are those who enjoy it. This idea is for them
---
Any hordes maybe? They all have a legendary.
---
You've replied a few too many times to claim the "I don't care" card there mate. You're also very bold to assume that one of the most common interactions in the game now won't be used later in the game. I'll have multiple characters all using this thing way more than I've ever used a tinkers bench, mostly because I put my perks into making my guns not waste so much ammo. Have a good day though, I did have fun in this.
---
&gt;Ammo converter shows that none of the players are complaining about the real problems with this game
---
No it does not show that
---
Mr Logic doesn't stop at your house does he
---
They forgot about it. Hopefully when it comes back we get real rewards, like
---
- the chem/oil drum instruments
---
- the cooking spit instrument
---
- stinky pile loot bag
---
- rotten leftovers loot bag
---
- Leafy greens camp decor
---
- Meats cart camp decor
---
- Greens cooler stashbox/cooler
---
- Super mutant spikes and gore camp decor
---
It has to do with Carnivore and Herbivore, it affects al things with food. Carnivore gets nothing from plant based foods but gets double effect from meat based, same with Herbivore and plant based foods.
---
U got herbivore mutation
---
Do you have the herbivore mutation? This has changed with the latest update- if you have herbivore or carnivore, you'll get extra bonus from the correct foods and none from the foods that aren't included in your mutation.
---
Same problem here. Though it happened after the game crashed. I had picked up 3/5, game crashed, logged in again and then the bug came. Done a couple of server hops with no luck. On PC.
---
homophobia really? Disagree no problem, but calling people who support Bethesda homosexual is  bigoted &amp; backward.
---
Lol wow u must be a level 50 or something... I got all perks to make my guns and ammo.. and honestly I don’t give a “shit” not I don’t care.. and I really don’t doesnt matter how many times u reply to a respond.. I’m just sharing options; sounds to me like ur getting a little butt hurt that I don’t like ur little machine..
---
Yea now that i think about it i would have to many 3 stars and it would take weeks to scrip them all.
---
In Fortnite's Battle Pass, the weekly challenges stick around until you complete them or the season ends. If the weekly challenge system is the same as it has been in 76, you will lose the opportunity to complete this week's challenges when next week's challenges roll around. That has to change if they expect people who start later in the season to progress.
---
"instanced" exterior cell.
---
Either updates as time gated, or updates as you make progress with donations (like rep that actually does something)
---
Seasons are out. Started 2 days ago.
---
the first level is 1000, every level after is +25 more so level 2 needs 1025.
---
Thanks. I was freaking out
---
It really sucks
---
Wish I could send a pic of my one day loot before the update and what I got today mind u I did today alot longer then pre update
---
And there it is, thank you for admitting defeat. 
---
Have a nice day mate.
---
Huh so that explains why someone was wearing the cosmos pa skin I thought you were able to buy tiers with atoms
---
Yes. Getting rid of it asap
---
*gay for Todd
---
Otherwise yes. You’re right. But I only reserve “Todd’s batty boys” for the shills of 76.
---
I wasn't talking about the shower, I was talking about the water purifier
---
Lol what?? U know what.. lol I don’t give a shit... keep using that useless machine.
---
150 Atoms per "level" they've already said.
---
It does look like y’are, tbf
---
Not for another ~2 weeks. Little less than that now but roundabout.

You only get caps by selling weapons to the vendors at the train stations and the ones scattered throughout the map. When you scrap weapons you get junk components and each weapon counts towards finishing the challenges that tell you to scrap certain kinds of weapons. When you finish challenges, you get Atoms (for the Atom Shop) or perk cards.
---
after 1-2 days after the reset its not possible to buy it anymore for the week.
---
Meanwhile: thousands of people still giving them fallout 1st money for a tent and a storage box that was supposedly not possible to even exist in the game.
---
Agreed. I picked up 76 again when the last season of Destiny 2 was dire. Was quite looking forward to 76 seasons.
---
New season of Destiny started a few weeks before this and I had a play with it and it’s certainly an improvement over the last season. Prior to 76 Season launching I somewhat optimistically thought I could play both. After looking closer into the numbers of both, if I want to make any meaningful progress in either I have to ditch one completely.
---
Another option is get the Handmade and Lever Action Rifle plans, craft some low level ones and scrap for unlocking mods.
---
I couldn't buy any on the day he reset?
---
I'll guess this is probably via the repeatable XP award and turbo stacking duped INT bobbleheads like old matey someone snapped at Lvl 10,000 on here the other day? I can't say I know much about the cheats but perhaps this was the method. 
---
If I was Beth anyone over a quarter/half of the board would be *gone*. I don't even need to ask questions, the math tells you no lawful means were used. 
---
Now they can complain about how bored they are and that new content should be getting added, etc... Etc.. Etc.... 
---
Cocks.
---
What's up with adrenaline?
---
I guess they paid for a year as op did and now they just can't get their money for the rest of the period back.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. A 1.50 seems a little hefty especially as I see myself only being 85-90, but I think I’ll manage.
---
- Donate junk supplies
---
- BOS fanboy simp preparing base for his dominatrix egirl
---
- physical changes based on biweekly server toggle and/or instanced progress
---
- radio message from paladin rahmani get less corrupted with each update 
---
- that collectron is going to cost atoms
---
Not working. At all.
---
Its a new animation yes
---
then thats another bug.
---
The real question is, what does Pot of Greed do?
---
I may take a look at tenderizer on my next level I seen someone here that mentioned it
---
This is the most I've played Nuclear Winter ever, even taking other events into account. I've gotten up to the Beanie for Christmas, and completed the Halloween side of things. Just need to grind out enough for the fur-lined jacket and jeans, and I'll be done!
---
You get SCORE points from Encryptid and Scorched Earth. You are meant to get them from all events. A lot of the weekly challenges are quite easy, and you get 100 SCORE points for every 10000 experience. I can't remember off the top of my head, but someone yesterday worked out that with no other challenges or sources, you'd get to 100 by killing SBQ like... 90 times, or so?
---
Don't stress. Just have fun!
---
I'm kinda jealous, but at the same time it's got to be detectable on beths end. Not wise to mess with that bottom line.
---
It was never intended to be opened from the outside. Once you're out, you're out
---
The Halloween and winter outfits needed 14,000, the gillie suit takes 2,500 after earning the previous unlock.
---
But to put it in perspective I have 20 3 star weapons left with about 5 days or scripting them from the last time I nuked whitesprings
---
Same. You see the hackers in NW getting away with it for how long and you think maaaaybe this will slip by? Highly doubt it though as no one should be level 100 yet as far as I can tell so this is super obvious and cuts into their profits. Can't have that.
---
Don’t have any sadly. Least I don’t think so.
---
Lmao sorry
---
2 Krakatonik#0052
---
They're already cheating, though, so what difference does it really make. Punishing legit players because of shit that dupers might do is kind of pointless.
---
    
---
The scrip cap legitimately makes me play less, both because there's little point in going out to farm legendaries because of it and because it renders the scrip purchases into a terrible week long game of inventory management in a game where inventory and weight management are already far too oppressive. It's ridiculous that it can take a week of play to build up to the scrip cap, and then take you the better part of the next week just to sell the stuff back that you don't want. If you start gathering more legendaries while you wait to sell off that junk, you just start stockpiling more and more crap that you can't get rid of...and it's all for what, a 5% chance that you might get something that's not instantly sold back for scrip again? Or less, most likely.    
---
I hate the scrip system with a burning passion because it's capped so low that it seriously restricts even fairly casual play at max level. It's so absurdly low that it wouldn't even solve the problem if it was doubled.
---
I’m keeping them all. Just to see how little we actually get rewarded.
---
You have to actually click on the bundle on the board to see what it contains. It's the last thing on the list.
---
If only I could remember where they all are. My camp has been at the same spot since forever. But I've broken it down and rebuild many times, sometimes just moving stuff out of the way and leaving plants here and there and everywhere.
---
Wym clan? If you mean a roleplaying community, there are already a bunch of well established ones around
---
We do, and even then it’s unlikely to be solved.
---
Run Patrol Duty at the prison when it comes up, I've gotten both plans several times from that event.
---
Yeah that's about $20 per 10 levels I believe? Maybe like $15. 
---
I definitely can't see myself dropping the money on it unfortunately. I don't see myself getting very far so to get the stuff I want is just going to be a bit too pricey.
---
Exactly
---
This is a roleplay community but also a community for a like in game government
---
I think many players are feeling the same. I know I was feeling the same with the whole bullion grind. I have what I need on my two highest charachters when it comes to bullion plans so I let the grind go and started doing more stuff I really wanted to do. This made the game feel less like a chore and I felt like playing again.
---
Now with the legendary run, I'm back in the same boat again. It is even worse because it is timed. I really wonder whether I'll not only be able to finish the legendary run but also if I WANT to finish the legendary run.
---
I still don't see the point in a skin for the C.A.M.P. Who goes around looking at them? Ooooo ... that's a nice looking C.A.M.P device you have hidden away there.
---
Or is it actually adding something? Like more build space?
---
But you don't have to be apart of the government
---
So stop playing?you say you logg off after 2 hours and havent enjoyed a single bit of it. Than stop playing. Easy as that
---
Considering Bethesda's track record it doesn't look likely.
---
Buyers remorse sucks. Next time dont buy something unless you're getting it directly.
---
Yeah this is the best way honestly because if you just spam X through the menus you will have to push O for days because the terminal menu doesn't have a leave option. At least not one that I'm aware of.
---
Yet another case where I'm curious: was this on PTS? If so, was it brought up? If so, how did it still get pushed through, especially considering they did hold legendary perks back because they needed rework (ie. they clearly aren't *completely* deaf)?? Like, I'm honestly just baffled how bad designs seem to get released one right after the other.
---
Played on day 1 for about 5h. Made it to level 10 (yes one set of dailies) and went out for a week long vacation without a way to play in that time (also why I am here lol) I'm fairly confident I can make it to the end before week 8.
---
You don't need it to just craft the stealth suit. You get scrip for deconstructing legendaries at the train station terminals, with a varying amount rewarded based on the quality and type of the legendary item you scrap. You can spend it at the Rusty Pick to buy other types of legendary gear or modules.
---
It's bugged to counter the bugged weapons. Once they fix magic weapons, this event is going to be bullet sponge cancer.
---
Lol dude same!
---
I had a new controller when I started playing this game and the A button is flimsy as hell now XD
---
Nope
---
Every time I go into build mode it resets my view to 3de person. And changing back doesn't work the first time I push the button half the time. Not to mention I can't remember where all the crops are. I've rebuild my camp many times in the same spot.
---
remember to share a perk card if you join a team. I'm usually the only person on the team that does it.
---
That’s what I meant. It’s 14000 for all rewarcs
---
Terrifying power in the hands of fascists.
---
I wonder if the 76 squad causes the pyroclastic nw storm, or the Bos....
---
Probably you will get what you want in day and stop playing the game so yeah
---
But it requires exponentially more score
---
Hell no.
---
Internal build is much more optimized with 50x the content.
---
It just works.
---
For me rubber-banding seems to be reduced or fixed, at least I am not getting it anymore on my bloodied Tesla. Previously it was like 5-10 minutes of mob melting and hello infinite health. Now I was playing for multiple hours and events and no infinite health. 
---
Plus they fixed Tesla animation bug with SS jet 
---
pack. I have reported both of these problems in bethesda support some time ago so get kind of excited and will report more. :D
---
Don't expect that
---
I'm on PC, but thanks, try this trick too
---
You do realize the levels increase in how much score you need so that early levels will be much faster than later levels?
---
And for me the problem isn’t how fast I progress more than I can’t skip any dailies or
---
Weeklies at all and worse, that includes the NW dailies.
---
Damn that radom.
---
Doesn't explain my 2.4 lb "weightless" dragon, they weigh 7.8 without that effect...
---
Haha bad guy go boom! Oh whoop did u want to loot that tee hee?
---
The totals for the Halloween and Winter unlocks is 27,000.
---
It's only like 1k damage to get loot.
---
Because I'm new to the game and have no idea how to
---
My only issue is cant do multiples. Let me co cert 1000 5mm at once not 100
---
This is so evil, I like it very much.
---
Rifle, if I'm not mistaken
---
I thought it was just me! I agree. My weapons seem to wear down way faster. It's annoying.
---
The Dev godmode is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be ***unnatural***.
---
Remember when wastelanders came out and everybody was bitching about how the gold grind would take forever and it needed to be nerfed? Now people have been bitching for over a month about not having anything to spend their gold on. Funny how life does that, huh?
---
One could argue that the old way was broken.
---
You're missing that one final screw, one card short of a full deck, and one wave short of a shipwreck.
---
Take my upvote for the Queen lyrics, and I hope you find your armour soon.
---
Some people incorporate it as a decoration, although doing so tweaks the spawn points around.
---
You can clip things into it and make them float when you move it again.
---
Seasons is actually 0 hours of gameplay. Nothing was added, they just put a grind-chart on top of the grind and cranked the grind up to 11.
---
Yes. I did all my dailies and weeklies yesterday, and today's dailies as well.
---
Not me
---
An 18 damage full durability pipe rifle with plenty of ammo will definitely help
---
if you decide to stand at the Ammo Converter for the next 2 hours to get 10 rounds of .45, you will also find the time to get out of the PA.
---
i think its bugged or an oversight, may be fix when bethesda decides to fix it.
---
hey, if someone kept stealing your water-cooled bonesaw you'd be pacing around too
---
You can also use it for the adventure mode level up. Or have him have a C.A.M.P. With things to harvest that are required often in dailys or near stuff that you need to collect often in dailys.
---
A tent, a storage box, private servers, and an amount of atoms equal to the cost of the subscription. It's not any worse of a deal than ESO Plus, but people don't seem to get as excited about that one.    
---
The game's got issues, but we can't just act like they'll keep working on it and providing updates if keeping the game running isn't making them money. Especially with the game popping up on Gamepass, if they don't do something about the free atoms there probably wouldn't be a game to play down the road. Sure, it sucks, but it's just the reality of it.
---
The clippy floaty thing I get - I do it all the time. But ... maybe I'm just burned out by all the re-skins.
---
it was outsourced
---
To exit a Terminal instantly just hold O.
---
And raiders camp gold press machine should be outside, just like in the Foundation.
---
Correct. The collection was modeled with the hat attached. Unlike rdr2, you'll notice the hats never fall off of NPCs when they die.
---
In their 76 Seasons FAQ.
---
They ask "ASIDE from challenges, what other activities will increase my SCORE?"
---
They answer "You will be able to earn SCORE regularly by gaining XP, AND by completing public events."
---
It wouldn't be so bad if we got the rest of the bundle so it would match more of our decor. I'm sure they have a reskin for each workbench and half the appliances just idling on the internal build.
---
I don’t use power armor so I often end up charging the nuke zone with a hazmat suit and no protection. Is there anywhere that one can find a level 50 suit of power armor?
---
Easier to just sell everything for 1 cap then camp hoop looking for your ammo type greater returns that way and less tedious
---
Where do I find this “vengeful mothman”?
---
For me, the chance to unlock the Halloween and Winter Holiday rewards in NW. I missed them originally, so I'm happy. Also today I've won NW several times with once dropping my first nuke and winning by killing everyone else with it.
---
Also should be noted that the endurance effect does not give you a hp bonus so really it's just strength and perception.
---
I got to the pumpkin combat armor and am very happy with the matching com at rifle skin
---
Same thing happened to me, but at Point Pleasant. Was entertaining before I fell out of the map.
---
There should be one at every train station, you know, like all the other vending machines.
---
Hi, when your on the perk card screen just highlight the perk you want to share and then look at the bottom of the screen and it should show you your platforms button for sharing, on Xbox it’s the Y button but I don’t know about pc or PS4
---
On PC, select one type of ammo that you want to dismantle, press enter then tab, then enter, then tab... until you are done. Same with buying.
---
It is still mindnumbing experience...
---
i feel like they hit chance swapped with miss chance, i honestly cant use my vats crit gauss rifle guy cuz i cant friggin hit anythin, back the heavy gunner for a while i think.
---
Thanks for the info! It makes the grind even less stressful, now I might consider buying last 5 levels for atoms if I'd feel like it.
---
Makes you wonder if bethesda are run by energy vampires who feeds off our collective annoyed negative emotions. Like not the kind that wants to give you depression or traumatic shit but like a hundred annoying stuff that eats up.
---
Okies... able to get back in now. Don't know if it helped, or just timing.
---
Did a fresh install on steam and update on B/net launcher. Log B/net first and got in, then checked steam and same. There is a scary moment when the visuals are loading that look very much like the failed attempts, but both loaded. 
---
Hope you guys got through this too.
---
Its animations makes me feel better as a person. Its like watching a natural downhill river. A sight to behold yet reality is much more tragic.
---
The sub doesn’t allow images...so I could sent it to u via email or something
---
It was a toss up between 3 and 4 for me actually. I can see why 4 was a disappointment cos of the karma.
---
I played through every time as a good guy with each faction, then a raider play through with nuka world. 
---
They could have made this game great if there were 2 completely different story modes that made you choose to be good or bad, and the events and quests  would naturally pit players from rival factions against one another.
---
Yep, but I was getting that bug a few days before patch 20 so I don't think it's a bug introduced with that.
---
I take it you need components that are hard to obtain in order to create once you have the specific plans.
---
Tab is Back on Terminals for PC?
---
Yeah it is not horrible, but some rate is just too low (I am looking at you, fuel). But still, it is more then nothing.
---
You're not counting the score you get from doing public events.
---
Some guns are deemed to have mods, such as LMG, maybe The Dragon is one of them.
---
Yeah, it is. Esc is leaving the terminal.
---
I know but, are you happy with the quality of this new update? Dont tell me they dont have enough from all these subscriptions. I have no problem paying for something that is worth its money. I love this game and the 69€ it cost me was well spent, i just dont understand why all the atomic shop items are super expensive compared to the game itself. The ammo convertor has never been tested, how did this thing pass QA. Not to mention all the limits, its so frustrating. Yet im still playing this game, its great, theres just so many things that could have been done differently that would make this game even better. I love trading more than anything in this game, but the inflated market and scammers are making it very difficult, every high value item is worth more than the cap limit. Feels like this just became a rant but jheezus sometimes it frustrating knowing that little things could change alot and its just not happening for some reason.
---
Strangler Heart? :)
---
It kinda is. I personally stopped buying 1st monthly subs after I realized there's no really meaningful endgame content on the horizon and after I farmed enough resources to not bother collecting junk anymore.
---
As far as I know these eyebots replace the ghouls in whitesprings after the place gets nuked and is recovering? I've seen it a few times as well and there were still a lot of blastzone plants in the area.
---
Same, on PC here, too. I just set my monitor sleep timer (in Power Options) to an hour in case I am AFK much longer than anticipated. I assume it has to do with borderless windowed mode or full screen, I don't even know which it is set to, but that's the easiest way around it for me.
---
Will do! Thank you for the help with this!
---
Sorry - how did this get no comments? This is a huge deal?
---
And was anyone standing on a fence or building or tent?
---
Also finally hitting the enemy only to see them rubberbanding back to full several times.
---
Apart from the 150 scrip you can get from the legendary machine, dailies also pay scrip ranging from 3 to 8 scrip each. There's also one daily that's not really a daily but repeatable.
---
Thanks, I'll add that, I just need to know Xbox controls and I can make it completely intuitive.
---
Yeah, in some places, the FPS drops like a fly...
---
The engine is a bad one, yiu can try to tweak in the config inis, but it wont solve that much.
---
So if I get 2,500 exp I should get the minigun and hunting rifle?
---
Yup exactly! I got my 150 point limit in maybe an hour? Gold in another 30-45 minutes depending on events. And then there’s nothing to do, I don’t need levels, and there’s isn’t much on the season pass that interests me
---
Do you think the banks print money?
---
The stagger is what's scary, not just the strength they were. 
---
In Fallout 4, being picked up and losing all control whilst it picked you up was terrifying.
---
But, there was something with Fallout 3 and New Vegas, coming over a hill to find a few seeing you was scary the first time.
---
I liked the way they moved better in older versions, unintentionally unsettling, because the movement wasn't as smooth and lizardy.
---
That being said, I think they're also less terrifying because of the multi-star system. There weren't any bloodied FFR weapons or Instigating explosive, or B2525 handmades/Fixers kicking about.
---
I think that's an underlying problem with the difficulty, the OP weapons/armour. Hopefully "One Appalachia" will fix that.
---
The rolls are 99% shit anyway so I think it’s fair to increase the cap a little. I’ve had to throw away tons of stuff because I can’t move it fast enough and my time spent goes down the drain. 
---
Duper’s dupe the good stuff they would t dump in the scrip vendor. It’s like being aware of pcp laced weed brownies, who the guck is going to put more drugs in a brownie and sell it for the same price? 
---
It’s way too easy to cap scrip. A casual player over time will have a legendary map route before long and find themselves in the same boat as day one players. 
---
Bethesda won’t make any money by increasing the scrip cap. You cap out and then spend the rest of the day fiddling with your camp.
---
You mean 8 ghillie suit paints don't excite you?
---
That's it, I'm not much of a 'gamer' I player may be 1 or 2 titles and stick with them. I'm not interested in every new game that comes out.
---
I like to get heavily invested in one series. That's why I liked fallout 4, I liked building my settlements up and exploring with my companions.
---
The mods made it even better. This game feels like my main objective now is to gather junk. This new game board think is weird too, I'm not sure why my character would be sat playing a board game on his own.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I hate trying to do a lot of the events alone. So until this I was basically doing the dailies and scorched Earth and just messing around in between. Now that there are actually people doing the other events I'm actually going to them again. Finally completed project paradise for the first time. Didn't get anything cool though but at least it was completed lol
---
Who would win: 
---
SBQ 
---
or
---
3 cave crickets
---
tf i wanted to ask about valut 63 you dumb bot
---
Hello fellow whale.
---
Then try borderlands 2
---
yes, also you would get the Holiday wreath, Wrapped presents and Wrapping paper paint Hunting rifle if you didn't get them in December.
---
Have never seen that, but one of my characters had Penelope Hornwright come with him through the whole Vault 79 quest.
---
Yeah, I've had a rant post like this before. Problem is I know ill keep playing. At least enough to pkaybthrough the first season.
---
I just wish they really listens to us. We have community managers here, but they're fucking useless.
---
If i decide not to care about food, there is actually a lot less in my stomach.
---
I think they're stuck in a corner, the company isn't willing to invest enough into the game for them to really shake things up without them implementing better ways to monetise the game.  
---
By what I can tell, the game isn't as unpopular as the forums make it out to be BUT it's also not as popular as they hoped. So it's limping along.  
---
Public teams for instance should not have been a huge advertised feature, it's a pretty minor quality of life improvement. When you take that away... all you have is the new system for making money which they hope will squeeze more atoms out of people.  
---
The game needs to make money to survive but it seems like the money they're getting is letting them do 1 big thing once a year and let's be honest... Wastelanders was just a ploy for them to add even more grinding. It made the game more bearable for me BUT all it did was add another currency to grind.   
---
Will Brotherhood be any different? I don't really know. I am hoping that with the reintroduction of the Brotherhood they plan on slowly expanding all the factions to have new storylines but I really don't trust that the motivation here is to give us actual improvements to the storyline.  
---
Also, I don't give a fuck about private-instanced homes. I really hope that's not their main improvement and they will use this as a chance to make the roleplay of the game actually worthwhile.
---
The total atom count is either 1850 or 2k (can't remember if there are 9 or 10 150 atom spots). But yeah, buying the last 5-10 levels with atoms is actually a HUGE timesaver since by our current knowledge, they'll be hella expensive SCORE-wise.
---
You're absolutely right. From an implementation perspective that makes sense. But from a consumer perspective it feels like somebody sticking a Rolls Royce hood ornament on a tricycle hoping it will distract you from the fact that it's not a motorbike.
---
It’s not just VATS. Melee is still broke as fuck. The server lag is just horrible. It takes 500ms for the server to recognize that I killed something or swung at something.
---
So they took away the free atoms (for daily and weekly tasks) where people decide what to spend them on, and gave us “Score” which will grant rewards every now &amp; then, no choices. And the issue you have is the Maths?
---
ermm,,,, no?
---
i agree.
---
i really hope it will be there when i look again, i looked yesterday and couldnt find it in options, but reading this gives me hope...
---
this doesnt really bother me all that much. kinda lame havin to fast travel to crater right after ive just fast travelled to the vault and loaded into it, boom another load screen for me.
---
Nice
---
Hmm does the game really look like that when you dont run it in potato mode? maybe I need to get a brand new PC.
---
Nope.
---
I absolutely love the effect. I was thinking lunches boxes should be given for SBQ take downs similar to repair kits. They are extremely fun.
---
I could have opened a butcher's shop.
---
They arent useless they weigh 0 and are worth one cap each
---
You’re seeing a resurgence in players after a new patch. It won’t take them long to look at the score trail and see it s full of shit. And I literally lost my shit when I saw “ammo points”. Another currency system? Wtf we have been asking to bundle ammo since beta.
---
I also wish the Crater and Foundation had a legendary machine for scrip.
---
It happens from time to time, there's various reasons she doesn't land too, like people on the fence or too many tents around. Shooting her whilst she's doing the landing animation. Shooting her with certain weapons bugs her out and she either flies through the map or doesn't land for long.
---
Team leader can switch team type on the fly, and it does not break bonds or drop members. I was doing this last night. Builder team most of the time, then when doing an event, switched to Events team just before the event ended. Bit of a pain, but you get the best of both. All members of team were used to playing as a group, so that helped too.
---
Once again they should've asked Obsidian for help! Their system in New Vegas "just worked", Todd!!!
---
Dude, the fact that it's a grind to get too 100 isn't a bug that needs fixing... it's deliberate because they WANT you to spend Atoms on levels.   
---
Can we stop pretending that it's just a funny coincidence that Bethesda pushes features that focus on making money.
---
Food build, I don't know what it is but I definitely want to embrace this build
---
The sad part is this is probably the only type of thing Bethesda will keep adding to the game. More revenue for them.
---
No, not even remotely factual
---
You don't.
---
He finds *you*.
---
Maybe not a popular idea but idc if anyone contributes. I just need you there for the buff. Other people will do the events and I go through them quick anyway. So if you join mine go hide under a rock IDC just don't leave the team 😂
---
All game xp is scaled from intelligence, so yes it helps.
---
I just had the same thing happen and it was one of those where the spawns were non stop. i think that worked out better with a public team and lunch box. That much XP was nice to see, but I would have really loved to Complete the event.
---
He has to carve pumpkins every day. There's so many pumpkins to carve, and so little time.
---
Yep 😂 it's either their Starbucks coffee is not sweet enough or their fallout is not good enough.
---
Even just to 180 so you can get rid of 4, 3 star weapons a day
---
 the one on the board is a Sheepsquatch Plushie
---
Hopefully they release more stuff that you can do to get points towards the legendary road. I’m almost positive they will do something or implement something having to do with points being earned through completions of the upcoming stuff promised over the summer
---
Dont feed the trolls.
---
10 fertilizer is better than 1 fertilizer and the plant itself, but I think just the one fertilizer it takes to plant it in the first place would be fine. I mean there's no reason repair costs should exceed build costs, or even equal them for that matter.
---
Thanks a lot
---
Not sure in all honesty.
---
the perk loadout should come at the end of the year, i can t wait for it!
---
Yeah man... I thought they would have fixed it by now but as of today, it still happens...kinda sucks.
---
they could have taken the terminal off. Make the hopper on top interactive for the sell menu, then the dispenser down below interactive for the buy menu. Then just use the scrip style vendor setup.
---
I’ve had her literally touch the ground and before I finished my first swing she was 60ft above me and I miss.
---
The difference is those who bitch here say "this has been going on long enough." If you're a customer and are not happy with service for months and years... Go somewhere else! I don't understand why Fallout franchise is seen almost like a flag they you are fighting for. Rightfully there are things to complain about but to come with such intensity so frequently is beyond a disenfranchised customer. 
---
If Dunkin donuts makes me a shit cup of coffee I go to Starbucks. If they make a shit cup I reconsider drinking coffee all together. I don't go on Starbucks reddit call the baristas ass holes idiots and the likes. Maybe I email the branch or corporate but I don't stomp feet.
---
Is there a daily limit? Because I just finished one of the weekly challenges after ranking up about that much already and got absolutely nothing for it
---
Yes, I know but it seems to be just +25 per level. So the last will be around 3.5k if that holds true (don't remember whether level 2 was 1000 or 1025 as we start at 1 iirc).
---
Lets create a different approach creating exactly 100  (this season has 100 levels, right?) "units" of the same score amount, keeping that at the rough average of 1750.
---
Now let's look at the time frame. 
---
100 units / 70 days makes ~1.249 units a day or 2185.75 score as average throughout the season.
---
Should be doable.
---
Note: all values as I remember off the top of my head and all calculations done in my head (took a while) so if anyone finds something wrong then please let me know.
---
True that. They're expensive even if the modifier is the same throughout the entire levelling process (25 per level as we see it now). It's gonna be a disaster if it ever grows on the later levels to be like 50-75 score per level. Hope Beth is not that stupid to make it this way, or else there's gonna be helluvalot more backlash from the community and they'll find themselves in need to lower the requirements to retain at least some good will.
---
i am all in for seperate pvp&amp;pve servers and pure pve servers all together
---
seems like the only feasable long term solution to me
---
i am a non pvp player btw
---
I’m lv 14 about halfway to 15 did everything but the two NW challenges but been getting exp pretty fast
---
Maybe they should have added 10 more jumpsuits
---
The issue is that is broke team PvP which is what actual PvPers and not griefers do.
---
It is causing people to join up for a quick 3 events, get score and leave. I had that happen to me for a decent chunk of yesterday. Oh, if your in a event with a guarantee legendary enemy and one of your teammates tag it, you can loot it to. I tend to refuse legendary enemies in events. But somehow I was able to get the three from uranium fever and 2 from radiation rumble. It's making people just to endure the 8-10 mins for cosmetic items.
---
Yup this, I only play after the kids go to bed, and only then on my weekends. I can finish the fortnite season pass no problem this way. So it’s completely unreasonable for Bethesda to require this level of commitment for their game.
---
Scrapping it gives you the all materials back, and you can replant. Cheaper than fixing.
---
You and the guy who uses the converter/literally any other terminal in PA should start a club. I took down 5 people in powerarmor after the Queen today. It’s not even close to beneficial in any way other than no fall damage.
---
I’m on level 12 nearly 13 after 2 days so I’m hoping to finish in a few weeks 👍
---
You made it 5% to level 100, considering that score increases by 25 every rank. Since it took you 16 hours to get to 5%, it should take (by my rough estimate to get to 220,000 score) another 320 hours to hit rank 100.
---
This is **not** a PvP focused game, and thankfully never will be, any updates removing any form of PvP is a welcome addition, although I do think they should bring survival mode back so PvP players can go there and leave others alone.
---
No one is forcing anyone else to join a specific public team type. Team PvP is impossible right now without every single individual player initiating and staying agro to the other 7 players in a 2 team fight. 
---
Forget about multi team fights all together. 
---
I'm honestly gonna cry over it. It's sad AF. Fallout is over for a lot of us with this update.
---
It was also supposed be be out in Q1, so I wouldn't hold your breath waiting.
---
We are a group of more then 6 people on PS4 and your 100 % correct.
---
 If people are getting griefed because they accept random teaminvites it's their own fault. I can agree if they made this anti grief change on the public teams, but not on the normal ones. It made Pvp even more unplayable. 
---
Either they change it back for the normal teams or we get some kind of PvP teams for that with a disclaimer to prevent Griefing like "you're about to enter a team which is oriantated in Pvp, are you sure you want to join?" or something like that.
---
If youre American then your gold is held at Fort Knox it's not cast there.... For currency it can be held at banks but is printed at the mint.... Same here in the UK. 
---
SPOILERS - The story line wanted gold to be the new currency but with different waring fractions it would be silly to have the supply and sale at the same place. So each fraction can manufacture their gold and use it as currency and that currency will be back and insured by the Vault Gold. Thus making it Gold Standard currency. A bit like how currency used to be back before it became to costly for Governments to hold gold for all currency and instead started it issue bonds.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Yea, and in addition you can get bunch of other xp buffs. Like well rested buff, foods, bobblehead, inspirational perk and wise mothman event buff.
---
That's more like what I thought. My girl and I are both level 9, we skipped the two NW dailies and should be able to finish weeklies tomorrow. We haven't been playing a lot so not too much XP, but I think someone who power levels should easily get to 20 by monday night. 
---
Dailies alone should give at least 15 levels the first week. Then at least 2 levels from xp gains. And the last 3 from the weeklies guess it all depends on how much you play.
---
I know I'll be trying for some of the NW ones starting tomorrow since apparently the Halloween and Xmas rewards are unlockable at the moment.
---
&gt; Ghillie jockstrap
---
I need this. Now.
---
Why would you need to rebuild bonds? Are you starting a new group? I just change the group from one to another, my bonds stay.
---
Me: I have 3000x .38.
---
Ammo machine: Yes.
---
Me: I want to trade it all for useful ammo! That is your purpose after all.
---
Ammo machine: Makes sense to me
---
Me: And you’re going to be a game changer for the people who don’t want to buy ammo!
---
Ammo machine: Sure thing buddy
---
Me: And there’s no way at all Bethesda can possibly ruin this?
---
Ammo converter: Horrible difficult to use format, you can only convert less ammo than I can hold in 1 hand irl, and 10000x 38 will buy you less than 500 fusion cells
---
I'm pretty sure it just blocks then for the session
---
Who said that F76 is a non Pvp Game?
---
FALLOUT is a game series wich main story plot is always about human conflict. In a Multiplayer Fallout PvP would be the Feature that makes the most sense. This is the Apocalypse, no playground.
---
If you don't like PvP just go pacifist and stop complaining about it if you don't even play it.
---
They should never have scrapped survival. It wasn't perfect but some people liked it, and it kept them hassling the rest of us. While I have no problem with the complete removal of it altogether, you all paid the same money I did and expecting an aspect you enjoy to be functional is not unreasonable. That said, I think they're just gonna keep distancing away from it.
---
"Overpriced" 10 bucks or 15 including xbox live gold is not overpriced for over 100 games per month that you can play. Even fallout 76 charges more for their service, and that's a half assed game with broken features and bugs everywhere. 
---
Btw hows the defending Bethesda part going now that someone gave use data that the Public even is a seperate repeatable just like i said? 
---
"wHy WoUlD ThEY lIE?" Why do you think the "Tod,  sweet little lie" meme comes from? 
---
Again blind and delusional, and can't wait with another defending reply or the downvote.
---
The thing is the challenges were more engaging and requires more time that fit better in to a daily task. Challenges have been simplified so much it’s laughable. Now what is it? Collect wood? Scrap junk? Build 5 of this and 20 of that? Real immersive.
---
The bane of my existence is yao guai's. I've died more times than I'd care to count to those bastards. Legendary or glowing yao guai's are even worse.
---
Yeah because someone wants to collect 100 wood or build X amount of workshop stuff everyday...
---
There aren't many lobbies to begin with so one of you would miss a match entirely. If everyone was blocking someone then lobbies wouldn't be able to be filled.
---
I dunno, you should be able to get 10 levels a week even with 2 days. I'm already at 9, and I've seen some people say they Re 13 to 15.
---
Yes I made a post a few days ago brining up this idea to prevent more Griefing, but also with the changes for pvp to make it fair and fun.
---
...well, now I'll have an actual reason if I don't get any sleep tonight. Thanks for that image. O.O
---
They’re not out yet. Got pushed back.
---
At this point people will try to make the game look as bad as possible simply cuz they have nothing better to do and too much time in their hands, I have seen people talk shit about the pass and they admit that they don't even play the game so...why? Did hatting without reason became a trend?  Seriously, every big game developer has thrown season passes at their MP games and no one bats an eye but suddenly Bethesda does it and it's like Satan himself came knocking at their doors
---
I think a game should make me want to play it on a daily basis and not force me to.
---
Bethesda is really pushing the boundaries of artificial limitation with the excuse to fight cheaters, but in the end its their own insecure networking and lack of quality assurance that enables some ridiculous exploits. The added benefitt with the forced limits is the stretched out game play, which increases daily logins and interactions with the atom shop, while possibly also prolonging fallout 1st subscriptions.
---
I started playing with wastelanders and I do really like this game, but I see a lot of constructive and much needed critiques being completely drowned in a stupid shitstorm.
---
I personally think Bethesda should do a full 180 in some internal corporate decision making as artifical limitations should be a last resort and not the solution for everything. Same with the additions of ever new currencies with stupid limitations. I do believe the game could be a lot more successful in terms of satisfaction for the players and even money for Bethesda.
---
Yeah because it makes sense everyone leaving their vault after years of preparing for rebuilding the wasteland to shoot each other.
---
We are all the same faction.
---
Create a broken and shitty system. 
---
Watch people complain on how broken and shitty it is.
---
Keep watching.
---
People start to give alternatives to said broken and shitty system. 
---
A lot of the alternatives are a bit less broken but shitty still.
---
Come on, we don't need to settle for the better of the worst option. We need to make bethesda accountable for all the dick moves they done on all of us. 
---
All this type of post makes me fell so sad and angry. We don't need to settle for anything but what was promise and has not been delivered.
---
Sorry for my bad english.
---
The bugs they say are fixed, never really are. The bugs that need to be fixed the most, are never looked at. Bethesda doesn’t care about you. They’re a company and companies have the sole purpose of making money and that’s it. They will put what they want into the game that sells because there’s enough idiots to keep buying the shit they push out.
---
Just because its not how you want to play the game doesn't mean you should be selfish and only want them to update the game to fit your needs. 
---
Fallout has always had roleplay, raiders and things attacking you...so why does it bother people so much to have another person attack?
---
Nah the glowing one can be killed too. Killed one today that seemed to be summoned by some cultists in cranberry big.
---
South Virginia is my favorite state.
---
I think that'd be pretty good tbh. 1st need some more perks or something
---
was about to comment the same. Chances are very high nothing will change.
---
All. Then complain on reddit.
---
In the time it took you to write this you could have tried it for yourself.
---
Replace Canned Meat Stew with Tasty Squirrel Stew (if Carnivore) or Cranberry Relish (if Herbivore) for +25% XP.
---
Ah the old "bUt I'm A rAiDeR" excuse to make people feel better about being assholes/griefing.
---
It kinda hurts and makes me cringe seeing the people saying people are just complaining and they dont have the right to, personally i like considering what people are criticizing, but oh well. People will be people lol
---
Civil wars or other conflicts? Maybe I don't like Gary from room 22, and have bad intentions on my next visit. 
---
Something like that is even in the trailers.
---
Most of the time during the day hours in game he’ll be at his desk, or late in the evening be near the “band” area, but yes he does still go to bed like a normal human
---
Elaborate?
---
Wha what? Thank you kind soul for saving the button on my controller and my patience!
---
At least she doesn’t just fly off into the binary ether like she used to.
---
He never was on a table for me lol.
---
70% he walking around in foundation and 30% sleeping in his bed. Or glitched standing in his bed.
---
And it’s people like you that are why the vast majority of the playerbase is always pissed off at this bug or that bug. Would you rather have another grind or they fix fast travel and adrenaline?
---
Maybe. I had a good reputation location near me and I’ve gotten one event to spawn since patch 20. I used to have one almost every visit.
---
I always struggle to find my gourds. I wish we could just grow pumpkins. Its a lot harder to lose bright orange vegetables in brown bushes and grass
---
Some people are just assholes and griefers, so why should they have to hide it. You're basically saying you only want people to play the game as you intend it. I just want to fight something stronger than the scorchbeast queen and sheepsquatch imposter after completing the game for the 3rd time. 
---
Pvp will make you better at pve
---
Have you actually played this game? A flash game from 2006 is more fluid than this piece of shit game.
---
Legendary perks and the new boss fight got pushed back to deal with how underwhelming the perks were and some performance issues with the boss fight.
---
Yeah, I’m not too sure why. I’ve had her fly off to the big bend tunnel and back during a fight too.
---
&gt;What about people who want to play the game once a week?
---
Then they don't get to get everything in the game. There are rewards in the game, that reward the dedication and time spent. Just like in any other MMO. Not every activity is for everyone and not every reward is achievable with casual playtimes...
---
I guess fo76 is the new “best free mobile games 5 star rating! You *will* have a blast!”
---
i get this but wow, its a game and i would like to receive and spend things in the same area if at all possible.
---
Bad example.
---
Only one company makes this donuts and they keep adding less and less glaze everytime.
---
They are. Use a new character for the “level up in NW” ones (:
---
You should be able to pull 10 levels in a weekend. Seeing as you only log in occasionally hours might be able to get a level or two sorted before the weekend anyway.
---
On one hand, I agree with OP about pointing out the issue... On the other, you're not wrong either.
---
I have yet to finish downloading the patch i fear what i might see
---
But they have a SS agent, Smiley, at the Wayward to directly sale the gold?
---
Hrm.
---
Yeah, pretty much. It's there.
---
Exactly. I probably would use it now since im like level 20 but people who have finished the main quests? No, they'll never use these things. I hope bethesda salvage something from this game and try to improve it.
---
Some people have said you need to craft a new underarmer for it to show up.
---
&gt;If it wasn't for the fallout license, these games would be considered dog shit euro jank.
---
Nope. Witcher games are even bigger "dog shit euro junk" without Fallout license and they are also wildly successfull.
---
They likely won’t, they stopped us building on gold sites for when wastelanders dropped.
---
I wish they would, plus fix the damn loading in and a your camp locations taken, ok, select new world and being put into the first world 10million times
---
Cut your losses and dont look back. It will save you a lot of stress in the long run and may even un-shave years off your life for even considering buying the game. *If* you get the game to run then you *may* get your money’s worth, but after enough time you will be back here complaining about something else.
---
You've never played another Fallout before have you? If you have you didn't pay attention to any of the information in the game. There are so many Vaults that were ruined by internal conflicts. Who's to say Vault 76 would be any different?
---
Im stil annoyed by the bullion system to the point i stopped really even bothering with it so yes people still give a shit
---
Dunno why they did't just the use scrip UI.
---
Get rid of the stupid terminal.
---
Make the hopper on top one spot to interact with, it animates then loads menu to spend ammo for points.
---
Click dispenser on bottom, it animates then loads menu to spend points to buy ammo. 
---
Include the slider like regular vendor transactions for quantity. 
---
Simple.
---
ITS ACCURACY NOT VATS CHANCE.  
---
You still have a chance to miss at 95%
---
It’s actually the opposite of a “grind”. Most things are gated. The majority around here would be happy if it was a grind.
---
It's not just the ammo converter. There are tons of features in the game that are absolutely frustrating but could be fixed easily. Bethesda does not care about quality of life at all apparently. It seems like with everything nice they add, they happen to ruin it by adding some stupid catch. 
---
Their fix all solution is just adding new currencies and new artificial daily limits coming with them. From a business perspective this can be done to increase daily interactions, but damn Bethesda is stretching it way too much here. An often heard excuse is the dupers, but that's a sad excuse. Following this excuse, everybody gets to suffer just because Bethesda does not trust their own game.
---
It's all so sad because I still like this game so much and it just has so much potential. Bethesda also actually seem to care somewhat, but yet are not really listening. It just sad.
---
&gt;I often wonder how many people would forgive this games dogshit visuals, recycled assets, unresponsive broken gameplay and multitude of bugs if it wasnt Fallout.
---
You just described Fallout New Vegas. A game that is everything you said and is Fallout in the name only. And people love that wannabe Fallout. So here's the answer.
---
Well, to get the most from your gaming time, you sorta have to.
---
The ammo converter might be useful for low level players, but anybody with a decent char is better off making their own ammo. It's faster to get the scrap than going through that awful interface to craft handful of shells.
---
Well u get to play a new dress up game
---
The problem people have is that there are a truckload if things that have been broken since day 1 and haven’t even been addressed, yet they keep adding more things to be problematic
---
Take my upvote , its almost impossible to throw out critisism without Fanboys or Todds boyfriends downvoting , some just cant hear anything bad about Bugthesds even if its true.
---
It's there with Regs. Just scroll down further than when you see some other mods for SS underarmour.
---
You can craft your own. Do the excavator power armor mission when you are over lvl 50 or the BOS mission also gives a power armor, mine was lvl 50.
---
They made PvP optional, why do the people who don't want to play it just go pacifist and stop complaining. It's really annoying.
---
you say that, but no one has ever bought a missile or syringer ammo from me before, along with the odd other type. 
---
i think its great personally. needlessly complicated, but great. being able to get rid of the stuff that cant be shifted any other way is a welcome addition.
---
Okay so it's not with the other 2 mods? I'll have a look thanks
---
They seem to actively want to fail. With everything nice they add they always add a stupid catch that makes it unlikable again.
---
They seem to disregard quality of life completely.
---
Maybe i missed those but i still see more about it takin too long and people just not even bothering with it
---
yeah i know, the new roadmap is already broken also with the legendary perks but tbh i prefer waiting for something polished than rushing bethesda and get something half finished
---
Unfortunately your maths are off too!
---
You’re counting 100 levels when in fact there is 99
---
At the end of the day everyone is a hypocrite and no one knows what they want
---
As an active member of Fallout 1ST since it launched (Monthly sub) I have no regrets paying for FO1ST, it's only money, my money admittedly, but still only money.  
---
Thank You, Todd and BGS for another Fallout, even if it is online.
---
Honestly I wouldn’t be shocked for them to just completely stop even trying anything PvP wise. The game, it’s legendary system, and legacies do nothing but ruin any sort of PvP experience you may get. Not that I personally care, I only ever liked PvP in WoW, other games just don’t do anything for me.
---
This one time, I was building my camp (near Site Alpha) and I had it all destroyed by the SBQ. It was a mighty battle, but 2H melee is totally OP when you’ve done the Uny stack glitch and the Shielded SS underarmor (had 60 str pre buff), you’re using Nuka Dark (+6 str and end), a Str bobble  (+2 str), and Psychobuff (+3 str + end). Total of 71 strength. Do you *know* how *broken* that shit is? A BSS pole hook in sneak with the perk that makes sneak attacks do triple damage with Nerd Rage, Radicool, the slugger perks and others is bat shit crazy for damage.
---
Not having QA teams seems to be industry standard now. Bungie fired theirs and their IP is cracking at the edges. 
---
The truth is, the game is too broken to be profitable to fix, even though the modding community is just waiting to do it for free.
---
Found him standing at a 45 degree angle in his bed once. Dude has issues. Maybe he's haunted by the things he did from his raider days...
---
&gt; They seem to actively want to fail. With everything nice they add they always add a stupid catch that makes it unlikable again.
---
He he... When have they *not* done that?
---
&gt; They seem to disregard quality of life completely.
---
I think you meant “they disregard quality completely.
---
There are two options.  "Block for the session" and "Block." 
---
The "Block" only works in Adventure.
---
for those who bought the game : Does it still have major bugs?
---
from a person who most probably won\`t buy 76 .
---
No problem, I could understand every word. I agree that it’s sad. The game feels like an abusive relationship at this point.
---
Im currently grinding Destiny, i dont have time to do a concurrent grind. I have the ghillie outfit i dont need the armor paints, i would love the gatling gun skin but i have one that basically has my name on it. 
---
I do want the Sheepsquatch plush thats adorable. That's my goal
---
30? I do 300+ each run round.
---
This is not new homie. Dclaw steak, glowing meat, yaoguai ribs, Yao Guai toast all stack.
---
Yeah, that’s wicked.
---
My bloodied sneak commando is supposed to be able to solo the queen, haven’t tested it myself yet, but watched a youtube video of it and the guy was only using a standard handmade.
---
This game definitely just works... hahah
---
Mine was terrible on Line In the Sand, but there were about 15 scorched, and the scorchbeast, and the missile launcher going off.
---
How about they fix the duping and exploits, then that won't be an issue... 
---
We can only dream.
---
Absolutely haha
---
Those are better options. The reason I mentioned canned meat stew was because it doesnt have condition. So for your casual player you dont need the extra step of prepping it - you just turn up to feed the people occassionally
---
I have a camp right next to Crater. I love when people join my public team, fast travel to my camp and leave.
---
What is adrenaline?
---
talk to the feet
---
Quality assurance is absolute shit in fo76. They are letting so many bugs through that never should be let through.
---
In the newest update all workshop locations on the map have been replaced by regular map locations. Now you can't see their resources anymore and you can't fast travel for free to your own workshops anymore.
---
I can imagine this bug being caused by tons of possible things in such a complex game (and their shitty source code I bet), but the issue here is that it was shipped.
---
I'm pretty sure the issue here are internal corporate decisions stemming from an archaic management. From the outside it looks like Bethesda has not yet reached the modern age of software engineering by their absolute disregard  of common and essential practices.
---
Been duped to shit. No one buys plans lol.
---
I killed a Scorchbeast Queen in about 45 seconds as brutally as Eminem killed MGK right outside the remains of my house 😂 
---
And in a Chinese Stealth suit and a level 10 BSS sledgehammer I one shotted a Scorchbeast XD

Welcome to the club, we got t-shirts.
---
Welcome to day one of launch bro.
---
sometimes it reloads on my gatling laser automatically with round about 160 rounds left, wtf.
---
You also have to hack the terminal every time since it doesnt recognise you as its owner or whatever.
---
Some one broke down the math yesterday. Completing every challenge and doing one of the repeatable gain 10k experience each day. Will give you more than enough to complete the board.
---
Your graphics card should be able to go above 60 fps. Check CPU and GPU utilization
---
I dont mind spamming the button in skyrim because in skyrim theres no lag or any time wasted spamming it but in fo76 it takes alot longer.
---
You know I know this a thing for settlers, that you can get rep from.....
---
But every time out the 263 times I encountered this....
---
The settler is dead.
---
Like Owlets they added.
---
&gt; We have been duped in to yet another time-gated money-grab in an early-access, unfinished, full-price, 2 year-old game that employs every predatory mobile game monetization tactic imaginable that is only a few days away from essentially going free-to-start on multiple platforms. 
---
Here I stopped reading. If someone cannot at least get objective about their criticism and instead pulls random insults from their ass, we cannot take them seriously. This is worse than Bethesda's PR, because at least they try to pretend to be honest and care. Here we see a person with a hateboner so big that they twist the narrative to make themselves feel good.
---
Compared to this person, the people complaining about the ammo converter are complaining about "real problems". The converter IS a real problem. Ass-pulled accusations are NOT real problems.
---
When we criticise Bethesda with exaggerations, made-up accusations and outright insults, they won't listen. Why would they? Who would try to engage in a dialog with a person who wrote such blatant lies about their product? This is a way to guarantee they won't listen.
---
*Hey, you. You’re finally awake.*
---
Forgot the wood too and your supply doesnt last super long unless you repeatedly go to get many of the items. We really need permanent food storage because it would be useful and diners would start to open up all around appalachia
---
What's the exact XP boost?
---
They should fucking hire quality assurance.
---
I got the score points, the 1000 that is, for beeing in a team.. because the challenge was to complete Events in a team..
---
Commie. It gives aid items that you will actually use. The regular gives an insignificant amount of junk it’s worthless.
---
Except score is time limited and bullion isnt.
---
My unpopular opinion- a 2.5b$ company should qc their games and updates 
---
We got their final product close to 2 years ago and now it’s halfway decent 
---
I don’t understand how you can be ok spending 60+ and being ok with what was and is given
---
Tried making it where I could use all heavies, all melee. All pistols. Variety
---
Already knew this but great to see people will complain less now
---
Your clearly don't know what an "unpopular" opinion is. You just spouted the status quo. 🤦‍♂️
---
This is what I've been saying. Go into pacifist, avoid the PvP content, and let the players that bought the game knowing there would be PvP in it and who want to experience it have their fun.
---
The PvE community likes to say that PvP in this game is toxic and needs to be removed, but I feel like their attitude is far more toxic. No one is forcing you to participate, so why can't you be happy unless it's ruined for the people that enjoy it?
---
....Yes that’s the point
---
Any idea how many renames would it be and whether resetting/dropping items lowers it again?
---
Well, looks like you just wasted my time and you own 🤷‍♂️
---
Well just wanted to help as it is a terrible set up atm, I am banking that Bethesda will fix it up at some time, make it more intuitive, till then we just gotta find ways to mitigate the tedium.
---
I mean, that's kinda why I said it's great that the dedicated gamers have their grind, but it still leaves the question: what are they going to do for the casuals? The people who bought this game because they enjoyed all the single player fallouts that came before and want to play casually? Or the people who want to put hours every day into it, but can't because it would cause them to neglect more important things.
---
Now for the assholes to abuse this because they’re bored.
---
Hardly anyone plays NW unless there's limited rewards. Almost all of the top players cheat, but no matter how many times they are reported, nothing changes. It's insanely annoying but Yardley anybody plays NW anyway anymore.
---
I've got a full card. Useful for my fat man. Also enjoy the extra damage (however tiny) on my gauss pistol
---
Why shouldn’t the average player get 100% completion?
---
It's their artifical limits. Fallout doesn't cater at all to the "collector" type of player by imposing those limits, while it actually should.
---
If they would increase the storage more or better, add a way to expand your storage endlessly as you progress, the fallout 1st sales would quickly plummet.
---
Most people try it out once, get used to the space by having unlimited scrap separated from the actual storage, and then can't go back and keep fallout 1st just for that.
---
They're exploring articial limits to create dependencies, not just here but in every facet of this game. 
---
It's smelling like evil design.
---
That’s not small.
---
I agree in all of your points. I made a post a few days ago about how we need to change PvP, can you read it and tell me your opinion about my thoughts?
---
There are plenty of resource nodes in the map. And with the maximum of 28 in a server, everyone should have at least 10 nodes each.  Now about good locations or locations with high foot traffic that´s a different story. And i think it will always be a fought over locations.
---
Oof
---
Do we have to be in a proximity to the team mates to get the xp perks?? Do we all get xp even if only 1 of us completes an event?
---
Its awesome, 4 strength and Endurance
---
can confirm. No score points from public events
---
Ironically, it was the same. I did the Build up the Workshop. I think I’m going to quit those game, though. I’ve played since BETA and am a collector. When I heard the Battle Pass filled with exclusive cosmetics was coming out, I was pretty hyped. After finding out that I wouldn’t even be able to take a day or a week off without spending 30-60 dollars to pay for mistakes, I was a lot less excited. I’m gonna sleep on it, but Cyberpunk is looking really good right about now.
---
that'd be interesting, it reseting at each leg.
---
I tried bringing this up before the patch hit and was downvoted and mocked. PvE players don't want to hear reasonable suggestions that make the game better for both groups. We don't need separate servers. We just need players that don't want PvP to avoid the PvP content and to have an option that completely disables PvP outside of events/workshops (which we pretty much have). 
---
I really think if they had made pacifist the default mode and give players an option in the menu to check if they wanted more open PvP (or at least the "classic" experience) things would be a lot better for the PvP community. There would have been less negative experiences pushing PvE players to think all PvP is toxic and needs to be removed, and the PvP community might have actually had a voice when it comes to the PvP side of the game.
---
Jesus I turn in 3 3* and boom daily limit is already almost spent
---
Going on game pass in July so hopfuly they jump on and sort it 😉needs something sick of lag disappearing legendarys ECT ECT but still play and still help out low levels
---
And hopefully it doesn't have all the clipping issues that the enclave under armor has. I bought it. Just need 2 flux for it. Don't have time to set up a trade though haha
---
ok thanks
---
Also another skin for daily logins.
---
Ive gone back to ignoring .38 and .44 and not picking it up but I dump the 40mm, missiles, arrows, bolts etc into it. The points they give is decent enough and it makes it feel mor elike I am getting at least some value out of the rewards Im getting
---
Yeah, I'll have a look when I get a moment and leave a comment.
---
Nah man ain’t playing SeasonPass Systems I need to complete challenges for as the only way to rank up. I want to be able to grind XP for it while doing optional Challenges. Seems like I won’t come back to the game now. Bad SeasonPass Systems make me quit games completely all the time. It’s like a plague. 
---
How is everyone trying to implement this shit into every fucking game since fortnite and no one ever notices how it’s worse in those B2P Games compared to a fucking f2p game. Fortnite did it right (yeahyeah I know Fortnite bad) and every one keeps doing the same thing but much grindier and greedier.
---
Its definitely new and it looks imo the best out of all the greeting animations.
---
Thank you, I appreciate it very much, if you have any other ideas I could add or change please let me know onced you've read.
---
Yeah um no....
---
I don’t think you get it.....
---
I mean to the point where it’s more common for camps to have multiple resources in a location.
---
Not just the current rare spots where that’s a thing.
---
10% from cranberry relish
---
2x from herbivore
---
in the vid he had 2,5x boost (25%) not sure where that 0,5 came from, maybe stranger in numbers?
---
I feel that depends on your meaning of "get the most of your gaming time". Anyone that isn't a dedicated gamer is going to get hundreds of hours out of the game and not reach level 50 and i daresay that would be a large portion of the player base. Granted that anyone over level 100 isn't going to get really any use out of this, but that's because they already have the alternative sorted.
---
Yes, they just need to rework and reballance some things to make it enjoyable for most of the PvP Comunity. I made a post about it, if you got time I would really appreciate it if you read it and tell me your thoughts on it.
---
I agree. It’s not perfect, a slider like the vendor would be a lot better, but it’s a computer so it works like a terminal not a robot. 
---
Honestly, I was able to go through and turn in all my excess in less time than it takes me to cook the glowing meat I come out of Uranium Fever with. And I think the first time will be the worst right. If you do the tedious but now with your giant stacks of .38 and .44 and 10mm, from now on, if you jump on every other day or so it should take less time than many other actions in the game.
---
It's a perk in both Fallout 4 and 76. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Adrenaline
---
Ok i’ll buy communism
---
Lvl 6, played for three hours. Completed all the daylies except for the NW one. Did a few weekly challenges. But I was part of a building team and did a shit ton of events so got alot of xp.
---
Ok
---
I got a Christmas item as well, I was so confused because I was supposed to unlock a new hair style
---
Everyone.
---
Clearly, you're wrong. Bye Ryan.
---
My way of dealing with these limits is with alts and FO1st private worlds. If you have trustworthy friends who can help, you can skip FO1st altogether.
---
When I hit limits I can either play on another char, or pass the extra items to the alts to scrip. Same for hitting normal vendor cap limits, my alts can sell the excess stuff for caps. If you have one char that's really good at farming, you can use them for the speed of getting stuff to sell, and funnel the caps to your other chars. Angry Turtle had a nice suggestion for alts just for cap selling. You only need 11 CHA and Hard Bargain 3 for the best prices, and you can do that by level 11 or 12, so it's easy to level up a vendor alt for this
---
Log into a private world, and drop the items at a train station, I tend to use Whitesprings as it's pretty central. Switch chars, and go.
---
If I gamble a legendary from Murmrmgmhmrmgm that another alt can use, I pass it back to them. The alts all have to be at least level 50 to get the max level gear though.
---
Yeah it's a crappy work around, but maybe other players can use it too if they haven't though about it. It also gives you some variation by playing different builds or styles. You can also build different themed CAMPS for each char.
---
Once a week I do this to swap out ammo, as my chars use different weapons. The excess ammo the chars get go a long way to supplement each other. Passing caps back requires a trusted player or second account though..
---
The statement PvP will male you better at PvE: I Cann 100% agree I made a second char for PvP and the PvP Perkloadout I have makes me almost Invincible while dealing loads of damage. Also it's great to train you aim, your movement and all in all tactics.
---
You say that having paid your 60 and still continuing playing, which tells me that it really isn't the dumpster fire you're letting on.
---
And that's really not an unpopular opinion, that's what everyone else complaining about not being handed exactly what they want, have said.
---
I don't get why people are surprised, time or money, pick one to get to 100.
---
I just got on to see if the info about using enter and tab to navigate the menus faster was any good and the converter won't even doing anything.
---
I interact, it spits out a line of text and nothing else.
---
Facts. I PvP and because of that the PvE in this game is beyond easy/boring. 😴
---
Last time I had any fun with PvE was learning the vault raids and those are gone too, so. 🤷‍♀️
---
If I had coins I would give you an award for this, but I don't. Here take an updood
---
Is it worth 2000 bullion? No, but is it fun? Hell yea!
---
Hopefully Bethesda will see people either burn out from doing the same things over and over again every single day, or simply stop playing once they realize that the ranks are unobtainable. 
---
But considering that the game is coming to Game Pass for Xbox &amp; PC next week, they'll get a surge of new players that may be willing to pay for season pass levels. Not to mention that they're getting a paycheck from Microsoft for putting it on Game Pass for however long they signed the contract for. 
---
I bet it'll be on Game Pass for 1-3 months before they remove it, making GP players to have to buy the game to continue playing. Even if players didn't buy ranks with Atoms, Bethesda is getting paid pretty reliably for the next few months.
---
As someone who only plays intermittently I won't bother anyway.
---
❤
---
“South” Virginia, eh?
---
Am I missing something here?
---
I'm actually really happy about the NW rewards. It's all my partner and sister in law play, so it gives me an incentive to play with them given I'm past level 100
---
Same. I might just go find another game
---
We need to make a F76 subreddit for the PvP Comunity to avoid nasty PvE fascists from complaining about our needs.
---
Finally someone who gets it. Some rewards in online games are supposed to be hard to get or time-consuming to get and serve as a prestigious reward. Reward for dedication that the person can use to "flex" in front of other players.
---
In WoW I grinded out the Insane title or learned how to play the auction house to earn for the Brutosaur mount. I wouldn't get those without some serious time dedication. Many people accept them as reward they would never get. I see no fuzz in other MMOs about not getting every reward in the game.
---
I understand that Fallout used to be a single-player franchise, but that doesn't work for 76. 76 is an online game, with mechanics from online game. And rarity of rewards is a core concept of online games. People need to accept that.
---
Also, if the Season could be rushed through in 10 hours, we would soon see posts about "I'm done with the season, now what Bethesda?"...
---
Didnt it have an experiment but the dwellers were told there wasnt an experiment?
---
And you can only do a maximum of 100 a day
---
I wish it had another option to make ultracite ammo, seems even more useless without that option.
---
Then stop playing it’s simple
---
The term "maths" isn't used here in Tennessee. We just use the singular form. I'm not sure about the rest of the US, but it doesn't seem to be a thing here.
---
I do know what you mean with wanting to be heard by the community managers. Hopefully they’ll listen at some point :/
---
Yeah but someone else said the door was out where it would take massive damage so what would happen if the door just broke and it couldnt open?
---
If it was inifinate i would literally play like 24/7 tying to get a bloodied faster fire rare 50. Cal 😂
---
The one perk you dont share is rad sponge as its really annoying being mainly bloodied when suddenly i see that dreaded icon pop up and my precious rads disappear and honestly i usually lug round glowing blood as its easy to get and with traveling pharmacist they weigh nothing compared to toxic goo which weighs so much more but 2 glowing bloods is one toxic goo but weigh moderately less
---
Those things don't ruin the PvP for everybody. Just the people who don't want to put in the effort that is required to overcome them. Which is the most interesting part of Fallout PvP, tbh. Only reason I been on since the update is to test things, learn what broke and see if it could he applied. 
---
But even that isn't worth the effort if my team can't back me up when I am in a 1v1 and accidentally hit their friends who purposefully get in the way of the fight so it becomes 1v3 DESPITE MY TEAMMATES WANTING TO JOIN AND HELP. 
---
It is complete bullshit.
---
Unless you're going for a Junkie build DO NOT become addicted. Most chems only last 2 to 3 minutes (without perks) severely crippling your character as most the time you won't be affected by chems.
---
Anyways warning aside there are perks to boost the benefits and duration of chems but again not really worth it unless you're going Junkie
---
To ask Bethesda to add a beer hat in the updates?
---
Keep drinking it 🍺
---
Same happened to me with build up a workshop/camp.
---
I said it was decent now however I feel I am justified in my complaints especially as I still play barely
---
.....yes that was the point,
---
“Not being handed Exactly what I want” what do you think I want? Is asking for A halfway decent game from the get-go and some Quality Control is too much to ask for?
---
I'm going to sound like a real noob here but how do you 'efficiently' get scrip everyday?
---
If fallout 76 isnt the only game you need to spam a button for, there are programmable keyboards and mice.
---
I have an A4Tech X7-755K programmable mouse (currently out of order but served me enough) and can install macros in it to do anything a mouse or keyboard can do, only you need to hardcode it.
---
What they won't do is cheating (like aimbotting) unless they are timing-related ones in which case im sure bethesda would ban programmable peripherals instead of fixing the issues.
---
Ah good old days of Fallout 1 where the Plasma Caster was so broken that you could fire it 4 times each turn. It was so OP they changed the AP cost in Fo2.
---
You probably got the rewards at 3/5 completed. They seemed to have hard coded that at some point, I guess it was going to work in 3's and got upped to 5's later.
---
Except most people aren't. Many just drop spoiled materials. The crops are far more plentiful and less wasteful to use and replace.
---
You haven't seen either of the beer hats they already have in game?
---
You may not know this but to truly solo the SBQ you have to be in a private server otherwise you won't get the full sneak crit attack bonus dmg because even if it's an event or you're not in a team it will still counts as a group/team encounter.
---
It's been tried, tbh.
---
Died with survival
---
I would Be interested to know why you disagree as well?
---
I found some broken razor grain amongst grass. Was so frustrated I was about to google where to find razor grain and corn so I could just fix all.
---
I think it's because of the front sight. with the way it's set up, the RDS and the front sight are kind of aligned, i say kind of, because there's supposed to be a little "spike" ([as an example](http://2ht1mik98ka4dogie28vqc4y.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/back-up-iron-sights-buyers-guide-daniel-defense-fixed-front-rear-sight-combo-003.jpg)) in the middle of the front sight, but for some reason it's not there. So if you place it on the rail, the front sight's going to obscure it, and you can't fight reliably with it. 
---
That and because it's a handmade rifle skin.
---
Yep just saw that 94 Player subreddit after looking for it.
---
I always found this to be quite baffling.
---
So, Beth, you want people to keep playing every day by having a scrip limit... which is understandable until I can't turn in a 3* 20 pound weapon because the transaction has to be in exact amounts and there's only 39 scrip left.
---
So now I'm stuck juggling weight, item type, and star rating just to try to get as much scrip as I can? I just want to keep playing the game and not spend 30 minutes a day doing pointless math. This is a micromanagement nightmare in a game already plagued by them.
---
BTW - My group has over 80 players in it on xbox. 😔
---
Dam they really fucked us on getting atoms. I have never wanted to waste time on the shitty challenges for daily/weekly to get atoms but I always wanted to log on to get some vs none. Now im never gonna log back on 😂
---
Is it just me or are legendary enemies not spawning I've hit the crimson prospect, Rollins labor camo, and the sludge one south of Rollins no legendaries anywhere I decided to quit the game and come back later same again I even changed servers and still none
---
But I really can't think of a thing that we could collectively do that would actually make a difference.
---
Lmao.  Get 1000 hit points before you hide next time.
---
Rule 10.
---
Yeah, everyone.
---
I don't think they have a quality assurance team at all. They're letting too many obvious bugs through.
---
Yeah Xbox players are much more open to pvp then ps4 or pc.
---
Maybe their junks were pick up by some jerks and they were killed because shooting others and lost their caps
---
Fair point, considering cranberries are found in the endgame zone, and squirrels are really only in abundance during a community event like meat week.
---
Make a new alt and make some easy level gains.
---
You're currently upset at the state of the game when it was released, in a conversation about how it is, 20 large patches in. You're complaining about wanting a halfway decent game and some quality control, because your standards were way too high from the get-go.
---
What it started as and what it is now are both still what were advertised and what they have been telling you it was.
---
-Does the game function as intended? Yes.
---
-Are they still working towards making it better? Yes. 
---
-Did they force you to buy it? No.
---
-Are they forcing you to use the parts that you don't like? No.
---
Just in time for the godmode patch too. Lmao, Jesus Christ.
---
The 10mm SMG still doesn’t have a front sight and now the AR skin doesn’t have a rear sight? Also I get Bethesda wants more money for skins so they make them for the popular weapons but they need to show the other weapons some love. The regular Assault Rifle which looks like an LMG still has 0 skins or any love thrown at it. We already have like 5 Handmade skins why does that thing need more?
---
Tbh if there should be a gold press machine anywhere other than crater or foundation it should be in the wayward and in vault 79
---
It goes both ways. We will not respond to players with mics if they aren’t on PPT mode. I’m sorry but the last two nights have been hit or miss. We got some great PTT groups that were super chill with good conversations, then a level 500 without PPT mode will join. He will talk to us, then swap to his discord group, then back to us, then to his wife and kids, then back to discord, all while being on voice activity. It’s the only downside to the public groups.
---
Or you can just give Fallout 4 another go, install some mods and it will be feel so fresh compared to this tedious f76 mess.
---
What effort?
---
Like seriously, I could just simply trade away my entire gear for PvP gear right now. Instantly a PvP god.
---
Wow much effort.
---
F76 PvP has nothing to do with Skill or knowledge. Just who has better gear and can spam more Aid items. That’s it.
---
From what ive experienced of this new system, the rewards arent missing, they come really early. Like 1/3 of the way into completing them ill get them. But ill complete them to get them off my tracker. My girlfriend and i both started this same time. Same S.C.O.R.E , but we get them rewarded at different times into completing the daily/weekly. Bit weird. But hope that helps
---
they have so much armor pen its kinda ridiculous.
---
Project Paradise has the old lag and fps drops it had a few updates ago rendering it barely playable and thoroughly unenjoyable.
---
generally the fps and lags have gotten worse than they have ever been, now effecting events and areas that ran smoothly before the update
---
LOL I never use legacies to fight and I am at the top of the PvP in this game. I also will fight naked so armor can't be complained about. 
---
You sound ridiculous and you don't know it cuz you're positive you're right. Lmao
---
Shh.. What if the legendary run will be about killing an increasing number of legendaries as a daily?
---
Or scrip x legendary weapons/armor in a day?
---
I hope my idea remains a load of brahmin dung, as it is at the time of posting.
---
BOS apologist fanboys? What does the brotherhood of steel have to do with it? Or is it a tipo?
---
You can also use the camera glitch to get in if you can't find a work bench
---
Lol there is a glitch that let's you just run through doors, the ole hop through the window with a workbench is pretty well known, but GJ on the PSA
---
I would like a function to like overpay the script like ik ive got 39 left for the day jus left me turn in my 3* instead of having me to look for 3 1* armours
---
taking photos of locked doors you crouch in front of is kinda fun... just saying ;)
---
Sure, for what good it actually can do.
---
If you nuked the Forest-Area, it has a 10% chance to spawn.
---
Well i have it still on xb1 but i have the tri edition of the game and have done since launch so i dont know if that has something to do with it?
---
Support has never been able to help me with any issue, they just give a copy pasted response that always ends in 'we don't have the tools so we can't do anything, thanks for your understanding!'
---
Stay away from the whitesprings for sure, I have my camp there and all of the robots cause the FPS to really drop so when it's really bad at times I can lag spike down to 30 FPS for a few seconds and if feels awful that's with a 1660ti and a Ryzen 5 2600 the game honestly needs better optimisation I can't seem to get more than 90 FPS on the game (doesn't matter if I turn settings down doesn't make a difference tbh) when my pc should be more than capable of handling the game.
---
I was part of the beta for fallout 4 survival mode, felt exactly like you described it even then.
---
since the wastelanders update it is 95% chance to miss/deal no damage with the first few shots
---
Just use the PA-Glitch, if theres no workbench.
---
I think the problem with the implementation here is that it doesn't solve the issue of the lack of actual content. Shiny new things are nice, but what is there to use them with? Killing the Scorchbeast Queen yet again?
---
It has to do with perception. To hit on my full health chars consistently, I need to juice to least 22.
---
25 works great with shielded raider ua, radrat steaks or sweetwater tea, pychotats and bock.
---
Not anymore.  Whatever u put in it doesn't effect budget.  New with patch, along with fermentation.
---
See this is exactly why he keeps getting shit stolen, always sleeping on the job.
---
Yeah make sure you turn off vysnc in the config file otherwise your FPS is just capped to ur monitors refresh rate
---

Crossplay would be awesome, then i have the ability to play with my wife (she plays on xbox, myself on pc)

Really isn’t any way to. It’s really quite random. The only one that you control the encounter with is the wise mothman. Part of the event “path to enlightenment”
---
Take my upvote for a quality advertisement.
---
Wish I was lower level but uh... level 356 xD
---
Very generous of you though ^^^
---
Fair points it was out of place
---
I do not believe my standards are anywhere near high.wanting event needed mobs to spawn above ground, non invincible Mobs to spawn just off the top of my head,is that too much to ask for?Couldn’t return it so unless I wanted my $60 to go to waste 
---
You can like something and still criticize it
---
Imo it's ok but say I wanted to get 2mm EC ammo I could covert 100 5mm and it only gives me 15 EC ammo
---
100 for 15 is real low.
---
I just waiting on the final jacket ... it’s taking forever .... give me some encouragement
---
As far as I see that's totally depreciating the locking system. But seriously I am not even surprised.
---
It has to be an inside joke.
---
Liked when he interrupted himself too and started rambling on about Aubrey, they should have left it.
---
I'd rather pay for a premium track on the pass and grind it out in bursts of a few weekends at a time.
---
Some of us have full time jobs.
---
Oh cool, does it only overhaul the challenges system or is there anything else they added? I’m not home so I can’t play right now.
---
Hmm. Interesting. Maybe it's time for me to become an herbivore instead of a carnivore for now lol.
---
It’s misunderstood, true, and still allows for a 5% chance to miss. But the calculation must surely be borked when numerous reports all follow the same formula - they always miss the first shot and are missing multiple shots in a row, that doesn’t sound like a 95% chance to hit whether based on VATS or otherwise. I’ve even seen a 95% chance when I clearly cannot hit at all such as when the target is behind something or otherwise out of line of sight so it may even simply be a bug related to the display of the value rather than the calculation, magnified by latency - it might be 95% when you tap the button for VATS but by the time the server acknowledges and returns a response it displays 95% when the actual value is lower.
---
The Secret Service need the caps to buy food and scrap.
---
No. No they are not. Yet they miss more than they hit sometimes. I was a day 1 player and vats seemed to work perfectly back then. In fact, vats builds were the meta for quite a long time. I recently started playing again after about a year or so and oh my god let me assure you that vats is a hot mess right now.
---
Yes 2 of the weekly challenges gave me the SCORE when I was at 3/5
---
It's a theory, a normal control vault would of had a g.e.c.k device, vault 76 doesn't have one
---
Vault 76 has the c.a.m.p which control vaults don't have so you could say that this device IS the experiment that vault-tec put in place and the vault itself isn't an experiment but the  people that were inside are.
---
The experiment then is can civilisation and settlements rebuild after the bombs fell using the best and brightest.
---
When I started on reddit (about a year ago I think) I got downvoted a lot for saying this: “All future updates will be free and all micro transactions with be cosmetic only”. Looks like perceptions area changing.
---
Yeah, I guess it was mentioned right above. Definitely gonna try it out but not use in future.
---
Yeah it happens to me all the time
---
Either it stops at 16 or 20 or around that mark and I have to press the mouse again to continue shooting or it hits 20 and then I press it to shoot again and then the number changes to 0 and I have to reload
---
Been going like that for quite a while now kind of annoying
---
Like he said, rename it as well. Give it something like zzz - &lt;your favorite nickname&gt; so it ends at the bottom of the inventory list and dont trust validations like the not enough scrip left.
---
A Collectron is a camp staple.  Definitely go with that :)
---
I just cancelled mine.
---
Fun Fact: They don't ask for feedback why. Guess somebody doesn't want to report on this to their boss.
---
I would be happy with being able to add legendary modules to create any weapon, if I'm playing a sneak commando build I want at least to get a random roll on a weapon I actually want rather than a nocturnal rolling pin for example, unless you are roleplaying a night shift chef
---
So far we don't have the real-money boosts like replenish caps or bullion limit
---
Bethesda has said it's supposed to last about 10 weeks. the first two weeks you're not allowed to use Atoms to push yourself towards the end.
---
I found having multiple characters helps as a workaround solution. Not perfect but at least viable. I hit the scrip limit, switch characters. With four it work, and if I do get over incumbered. I transfer items to my food build.
---
I found the whole Ghillie thing quite out of place in the Fallout setting.
---
Not necessarily. Before I just didn't play because there it was pointless. There was no reason to keep playing because I had already done everything for the day/week/whatever. This at least gives me something to work towards.
---
Yeah the conversion rate is a little rough, but I think of it as throwing garbage in a bin and getting money out of it. Like it's the last line of defence for when you run out of crafting materials and ammo at the same time. Saves you from farming materials (likely on a server where people have already picked it clean) when you'd rather be off shooting things.
---
So god mode was only patched by words?
---
So the first 2 guys join opposing teams, otherwise no PvP. The next one comes and joins his mate or the higher level guy. Third arrives and thinks I’ll join these 2 cos I want to win. Fourth guy joins and thinks I’ll go with the 3 cos I’ll get higher rewards. 5 of 24 players on a server is probably more than average for PvP players so no one else joins. An hour later the lone guy has died 99 times, had his camp destroyed 80 times and has no crafting materials to rebuild. You really think that’s fun????
---
YES!!!
---
Not sure about anyone else but if I'm at max cap I'll go to other peoples camps and buy cheap rubbish legendaries
---
Also the atomic power skin is several rewards up the board.
---
Making nearly 20% of rewards the same thing
---
I would doubt Bethesda will reinstate it after seasons is over $$$
---
We'll pass him in less than three weeks.
---
Nope they’re gone. 
---
A new season will roll in when this one ends
---
Yea their argument removing them was "you can still get free atoms from world challenges". Greedy bastards... The amount of atoms we get from s.c.o.r.e. is 1/4th what we would get doing the old weekly/daily challenges for 10 weeks.
---
I doubt he meant broken as in strong, more likely as in glitched. How does pvp even work when everyone has a 16-shot, shotgun scatter shot, suicidal explosive, laser sniper, orbital strike, INSANE 3000 damage, ultracite gatling laser tesla rifle glitch weapon, check description for video?
---
PvP shouldn't exist in a game full of broken stealth builds. Fact.
---
If the game would require skill, yes make it PvP. So it isn't just about who can drink 600 Quantums.
---
At it's current state, especially with VATS and Quantums, no. No PvP.
---
B.b.but it's free, so you clearly shouldn't care that they took away something from you and introduced a grind. (sarcasm sold separately)
---
I wasn't aware of that atoms mechanic, that's interesting
---
Also, we're supposed to beat the villain's ship in the legendary run? He's way past me already and I've already grinded the weekly and daily challenges.
---
https://imgur.com/a/uCPOvy2
---
250 x 70 = 17500 scores missed from every daily NW Challange.  17500 / 100 = 175, 100 score from repeatable. 175 x 10000xp = 1750000. 1.75m xp
---
Yeah just the challenges. More of a "battle pass" kind of thing. Do tasks, earn points, rank up for rewards. There's a new teams system too which makes it easier to join teams and rewards you for doing so. Aside from that, it's the same.

---
Yeah that's true I have tons of 5mm ammo anyway so it doesn't really bother me too much
---
But I thought of it as I'm getting 15 2mm EC ammo which will easily burn on an enemy in one second with the Gauss minigun
---
But yeah it is the concept of trash for money which is fair enough
---
Wouldn’t it be easier to calculate how many levels you would have to do each day?
---
So that will be 70 days with 100 levels to complete. 
---
1,4 level every day
---
He was back in his bed when I went yesterday to take his intrusion module back
---
I have to agree with the other guy. The actual content, like the new story is still accessible for casuals. The game itself still has more than viable builds achievable by casual players. All the extra bits awarded by diligent players is just that, extras. They're not a necessity nor even that desirable to lots of people.
---
This going said, the game needs more content in general for both casuals and committed players.
---
Regardless the terminal is too small. Not everyone who plays this game is a teen with 20/20 vision.
---
Bethesda are if not intentionally, discriminating against older players what with the need to spam keyboard keys to carry out crafting actions, re smelting.
---
My arthritis does not thank Bethesda for this.
---
The evil doctor zorbo's space cruiser starts off 30-ish spaces ahead of you. I'm guessing that is because there are seven days in a week and the season it supposed to last 10 weeks. in the bottom right of the screen you'll see a fuel gauge for his ship which fills over time.
---
Pvp teams with members already red and ready to be engaged by other pvp teams anytime. I'd like that.
---
It would solve most the boring engagement rules I always hated in this game, but there would still be the problem of meta guns and aid abuse.
---
The gold star daily bit under the new daiky challenges section.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind ghillie walls and roofs, could try to make some proper camouflaged camps.
---
Honestly fallout 1st is the biggest scam going.
---
Monthly subscription to have a scrap box and option to play privately. The second 1 being a standard feature in other games (think gta as example)
---
And the fact they completely bypassed fallout 1st for the season pass shows they are happy to provide mediocrity as people will pay for it
---
Pretty soon we'll see colossal mole rats and bugs as 'extra content'
---
how the fuck would you even know that you're "in the top pvp of the game" whatever the hell that means lol
---
there isn't any form of pvp ranking system, and you say you don't use legendaries for pvp so I know you probably have no idea what you're talking about
---
You have a small chance to encounter cryptids like mothman or flatwoods monster at specific unmarked locations on the map. The only way to raise that chance is to visit all of them, rinse and repeat. There are maps for random encounters. The one I personally used (when I needed to find sheepsquatch or flatwoids monster for example) was a part of mappalachia project. You can google it.
---
Why are they greedy bastards?? Surely you cant expect them to run a game forever for free with no revenue streams to maintain the service.
---
What made you believe you'd be able to exchange a low damage round for a higher damage round 1 to 1? 
---
Lots of people seem pretty entitled on this thread. 
---
We get a way to get rid of old ammo, it's lore friendly with the terminal, yeah it's a bit clunky but 99% of bitching is "no not like that"
---
I hate to admit it but I find it very difficult to see the screen on the converter as well. Using a 32 inch screen and sitting a couple of feet away doesn’t really help.
---
that's cool, so if the fuel gauge gets full he moves one space, do you know how long he replenishes his fuel?
---
Overthinking much? How would they even find his camp? And nost importantly,why would this moron still fight 1vs x number when he can bail and be safe anytime?
---
Boy you're gonna be thankful when Knights of Ni patch gets there!
---
You might want to check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals a sub that was set up by people who wanted to talk about stuff instead of 100 threads about a canvas bag.
---
ive tried it round about 50 times, got nothing except ammo and stimpaks.. I'm not going to try anymore.
---
You'll be around 22.5k score short of the max reward, assuming the requirements don't plateau at a certain score amount. Meaning you'd need 225 repeatables added in over the 10 week period, which is a little eye watering 2.25 million exp earned over that same period.
---
Alternatively, this will put you around level 92 or higher (as you'll have completed some of the repeatable exp weeklies passively by this point), so you would need to spend 8x150 atoms totalling 1200 to purchase the last eight at most.
---
the whole new lunchbox system is wonderful! during scorched earth me and 20 other players each used all of our lunchboxes and I had so many effects
---
About twenty-four hours. Once per day
---
Events offer scrip as rewards, as posted earlier scrip can be purchased from player vendors. There is low level scrip from Leader of the pack. I find legendary gear in containers in Rusty Pick and train stations left by players.
---
I’m about at that point as well
---
Turn off your radio and go to Watoga. Once you hear whisper like screams of the souls of the dead you can be sure that he spawned somewhere in the area.
---
I got a plan last week off it. As far as I'm aware I think it's just initiate that doesn't drop anymore.
---
I agree with you, however the only one of those things that is *required* is the buy to play, the other stuff is optional.
---
Its easier and faster if you use "WASD", because your left hand is already there.
---
Is it even worth coming back to?
---
Despite having prefect sight, I would like to have an option to open terminals on a full screen. Just like we have with a pip - boy interface.
---
That would mean admitting they broke it.
---
They have a really low drop rate but yes they are still possible to get, as long as you havent acquired the Elder paint plan from somewhere else. They only drop n order after the previous has been learned.
---
And I dont know about whitespring bunker. I was there last night and picked up 3 which is normal. Some sessions id get none but usually at least 1 up to 4 on a good day
---
I did everything already and just passed lvl 11
---
The big question is, where on the map is this?
---
I dont remember them fixing Fallout 4 bugs.
---
Yes, this is what I know as well.
---
I think I still got a Knight Paint job Plan if you want to buy it.
---
I knew tenderiser doesn't even work
---
The game isn’t a free2play game, you had to purchase it. Plus they make money from fallout first and cosmetic packs.
---
They said there would be a couple of weeks between seasons.
---
If you enjoy the game and want the rewards yes. If you're not bothered about cosmetics/camp items there's nothing new for you in the way of quests or anything.
---
The XP requirement for levels goes up as you get further in. So 1.4 level at first is easier than the 1.4 levels you will need in a month.(if you progress the pass)
---
I actually like the season better than the regular challenge grind.  Now atleast it gives us something else to grind for
---
I just joked about food crafting mate
---
Yep, just got knight cpt plans today
---
But any other game you play has a limited lifespan even when you purchase it at full price. You cant expect never ending updates and free expansions and free cosmetics etc forever that's just not realistic. Yes they brought out fallout 1st as a revenue stream but even then people were hating on that. Things for the game take time to make their end which ultimately costs money. That money has to come from somewhere. If it becomes financially unviable to continue the game they will stop
---
The teams do make things a bit more lively, it has been some time since I've seen the events so packed out, people seem to be friendly enough and it adds a little bit more to the social aspect of things. It's an almost perfect solution to let people team up but not be constrained as each member can still do their own thing.
---
Why do I say almost perfect? Only because I've noticed an uptick in folks simply greasing legendary mobs and not waiting for others at the event to get a shot in. I was at One Violent Night on the first day of Legendary Run and 2 of the regular mobs were 3 stars. I kited them towards others there to let people tag them, but when the nightstalker arrived? No such  courtesy was extended back to others. Someone just ran towards it and iced it on the spot leaving about half a dozen people out in the cold.
---
Do you play with mods? I had a similar issue when the game crashed after exiting the mine from the Load Bearing event and then would crash every time I tried to log in on that character. Disabling all mods fixed it. I haven't tried re-enabling them one by one to see which one caused the error, though.
---
“First Expeditionary Force, this is L-H with a recorded Priority Gamma message. Papa Romeo missed the last four check-ins. No contact since crossing the Rockies. Scribes estimate unit position in the vicinity of Lincoln. Orders are to reestablish comms with L-H ASAP and provide a full report of whereabouts and activities since last communication. Acknowledge on coded channel Two Three. L-H out. Message repeats.”
---
Whats the recipe for those again? Cheers!
---
I upvoted OP but... it would be nice if you would put suggestions of how to make it 'more fun'. I'm a casual player also with a real life!
---
I wonder is Rivet City is still just an aircraft carrier and populated by pre-was US navy dudes by the time of 76
---
Definitely HeHe! The Dirt Tiles are good for this!
---
Not everyone lives on reddit.
---
Simple but great idea. But then they cant get fallout 1st members to part with their ton of atoms, and they need to drain those wallets in order to earn more money. And such people are quicker to put their hands in their pockets and pay more
---
Funny thing is, I thought my cores were just all trash. So I made myself brand new ones and decided never to reload manually. I’ll pop a 100% in and 100 shots later I’m reloading, new core gives me 26 bullets... wtf okay.. shoot those 26 and I stop firing but don’t reload. Shoot again and I’m at like 474 shots now. Fire again and I start shooting finally.
---
This is? But I can ear she call help and abbie
---
There is no white pipboy lamp, but maybe they had some hat with a lamp on it.
---
Don’t even need any gear, just get a legacy laser and melt them in a quarter of a second.
---
It's the whitesprings robots.
---
Watoga, I assume? Not being a Mayor yet, I guess?
---
You do understand the concept of a battle pass.. right?
---
Yep just found out it's a new atomic shop helmet that replaces your pip boy light.
---
No the whitesprings robots.
---
A bunch of civilized ghouls still clinging to the old military ways would be a really interesting settlement.
---
Want to know as well. The lack of info regarding one of the most usefull perks being broken is disturbing.
---
u/valseek, u/Ladydevann Any news?
---
I believe I got score when turning in a raider daily. Unless it was just the bar didnt show at the correct time and was a coincidence. 
---
Kind of like how treasury notes or legendary pops up much later after you got it
---
That's my point, it's designed to make money so can we stop pretending that the grind involved is a bug... no they want you to spend money on rewards
---
Joined a team yesterday but we were never close on the map. At all. Completely different areas. Do the shared perks still work? The bonus multiplier did.
---
What about ammo crafting? If i farmed steel id be spamming as well.
---
Oh there’s 2 I thought you meant the other one. Obviously, spoilers but the full transmission without any cuts is in the files. Here it is if you wanna listen: https://soundcloud.com/jonathan-campbell-45/bos-broadcast-paladin-rahmani
---
Damn so do NW or your screwed.
---
Seen a few low level vault or responder players showing up at the queen fight recently
---
You can do it bro
---
Sarcasm aside, it’s better that than nothing. Sure, a pipe revolver or a hunting rifle fares better in terms of damage, but we’ve all used a pipe pistol at least once when starting out.
---
Did you shoot them? Server hopping should help. Explosive ammo pisses them off too
---
The door is in prestige condition from what we've seen. 
---
Some vaults just were never meant to be opened from the outside, this is one of them
---
Now I try, but there are any stuff to see in the map? Or they will add anything in another update?
---
No never. They are always mad at me even when server jumping
---
Having one at the Wayward makes sense to me given that it's a focal point for obtaining gold outside of the treasury notes. Adding one to Whitespring like they did to the factional vendors wouldn't hurt either.
---
Did you make manual tweaks to your fallout76pref file configurations?
---
I know the settings to turn the water black or back to normal:
---
uiShadowFilter=1
---
uiOrthoShadowFilter=1 
---
Make sure these are set to 1 and not 0 or any other value for regular water color.
---
To find the Fallout76Prefs.ini file and make these changes: Navigate to Documents &gt; My Games &gt; Fallout 76 and launch Fallout76Prefs.ini
---
If you do everything cept the repeat xp one you'll get 215,000 out of 220,000 or something anyway it's only 5k score if you do all challenge so it's easier to math 5k, you need 500,000 xp 10kxp = 100 score.
---
Yes I do. I‘ll give it a try later. Thank you!
---
Lile all other games involving a season pass, it becomes a chore rather than a fun activity. I personally hate season pass models in games, and when every game has one it's annoying.
---
The players that you describe should just play game untill the story is complete (or they have had enough) and then move on. Just like every other game.
---
The grind rewards are there for the people that put the work in. Just like life.
---
Don’t think I have Tricentennial, but I’m pretty sure I paid atoms for it when it came out last year “sigh”
---
Not mine but Good on you If you are on ps4 I got some free chems and booze for you
---
uiShadowFilter=1 uiOrthoShadowFilter=1
---
I havnt witnessed the confetti in person yet,  but as long as it doesnt end up like halo confetti 
---
(constant kids cheering yaaay every match)
---
Not to mention the thing is freaking huge, just trying to find a spot to put it required me rearranging my entire crafting bench space.
---
There are a place where we can found anything or we can ear clear the transmission?
---
ehh idk. mb not a “completonist” just dont like to be locked out of stuff ig. just to clarify
---
They should not be hostile towards you unless you've attacked them, although relogging should "fix" that. 
---
Where at the WS is this? Everywhere or just at the Golf Club? If it's only at the Golf Club you might just have very bad luck because robots can spawn there after a nuke zone resets, although that's usually only eyebots.
---
(-o-)
---
Guess enough people weren’t paying for Atoms. Now they have a way to “encourage” you to buy.
---
Agree and disagree. 
---
Yes, manage your expectations. People shouldn't complain about things like no NPC's or cosmetic micro transactions. Because that's what the game was sold to us as. We knew that's what we were going to get. We can ask for change though.
---
No, we can reasonably expect them to fix bugs. We can and should complain when they go back on their word or not fix things that are broken.
---
The complaining did give us the likes of watelanders, push to talk and public teams though. The last 2 should've been in from the start and are reasonable expectations.
---
I guarantee I would wipe the floor with 99% of the players in this game even after giving them the exact same gear and aid I have access to. 
---
Wastelanders broke stealth so some workshop takeovers are who is the most patient. That's about it. 
---
Wastelanders also broke VATS. 
---
So, again. We have someone talking who doesn't participate and should not have a say.
---
People still seem to be avoiding Project Paradise and I've not seen Encrypted active the last few days, but everything else popping seems to get the boots on the ground, even Radiation Rumble is getting popular.
---
I don't think anyone knows yet as there are most definitely being changes made to it in some way or another.
---
If you see one with red eyes, I believe that's the vengeful one. Shoot it and find out.
---
There aren't enough servers for NW to be picky about who's in your server. I just join, if there's a hacker, I leave and join another.
---
By the fact that I know literally every player that can beat me.
---
Just pick the lock?
---
It will show in the atomic shop right ? Omg
---
Come on this is the Fallout universe ... no Covid-19 here.. party on!
---
I don't use them, didn't say I don't own them.
---
I just did project paradise and it was like the entire server was there. Same with encrypted earlier this morning like half the server was there
---
The one gripe I have about this is the fact that we are getting on event this season. I'd be fine with season passes if they weren't a chore, but it's just a schemey tactic that companies use to persuade you to play their game otherwise you miss out.
---
If you are on xbox and I don't recognize your GT - the only way you're winning is because you're a secret alt of someone I've fought before. Lmao
---
You aren’t forced to do NW daily. You have the option to do NW daily.
---
I just temporarily deactivated re-shade, better inventory and custom markers. Now it works!
---
That‘s why I love Reddit...Thanks Buddy!
---
I tried to do similar and had lvl 10 and 20 gear free on my vendor, with a sign that said “starter gear lvl 10-20“
---
I stopped after little over a week, when I had resupplied the vendor 5 times after lvls 100-235 players had taken the items.
---
Usually they went to my crafting benches immediately after emptying the vendor.
---
Decided to forget about that idea.
---
Sorry, I play on PC and there Esc takes you out from every conversation immediately.
---
Try the map button maybe?
---
Why would I go down as low as one of you twats for no reason other to be a twat.
---
If you think you are so good in the game, then by all means, go play NW, because that is what it's for.
---
But it's you kind of people who sweat through their shirt, trying to prove you arent worthless, even though you dammn well know you are.
---
No. Thank. You.
---
Guess I've just been unfortunate on that front, I've seen PP active 4 times and not a single person went near it.
---
Not mine as I play on PC, however upvoted for being a stand up bloke.
---
What platform are you on?
---
You're gross.
---
Didn’t you hear they’re about one patch away from completely eliminating pvp altogether lol
---
By Prime?
---
This happened to a friend and I. The SBQ landed outside of the normal boundary, and we went to loot her. We didn't even notice until we started walking back and saw the fence.
---
487 of those hours were AFK collecting masks 😛
---
Indeed. I have them all now
---
We’re asking the people who couldn’t even copy and paste a garage door with a new coat of paint without breaking their game to create a system that rewards cosmetics for doing things you would “normally do” in “day-to-day gameplay”. Pathetic.
---
Next season will have a ghillie paint for every weapon in the game.
---
The RUBICONNNNNN
---
God I hope they made this trailer before they released the disaster that was legendary perks onto the pts and quickly learned how god fucking awful an idea they all were.  Because if they really haven't been working on changing them based on everyone's feedback it's going to be a total shit show when they actually release it.
---
For sure! I'm kinda sad I didn't know that because going through the silo alone was killer lol.
---
&gt;so in the end is season bad? Is the grind too much? That's a totally subjective take
---
Nope, there's nothing "subjective" about whether or not seasons is bad, it is objectively bad and worse for players than what we had before with just outright atom challenges allowing us to earn atoms at an okay pace and choose our own rewards on the atom shop.
---
Bethesda went with this new "seasons" system because fo76 players were doing challenges/saving up tons of atoms at an okay pace and not being pressured enough into buying atoms MTX, and this makes zenimax investors upset, so bethesda stripped away our ability to do in game challenges directly for atoms and now only allows us a tiny FRACTION of the atoms we used to be able to earn before, in this new season system which just throws random rewards at you 90% of which you don't care for whereas before you could do challenges and earn atoms and pick out your own rewards from the atom shop.
---
You can dispute some of the specifics of the math of the grind people have alleged, but there is no valid dispute against the fact that seasons is worse for players and it's a move by bethesda to pressure people into buying atoms.
---
And yes, the grind is too long, the fact that you would STILL BE SHORT of completing the seasons chart even if you did all dailies/weeklies (if you don't do the repeatable) is pathetic.
---
The earlier popular post was misleading, you can still make it.
---
It helps a ton, especially after watching Juice’s video. But the thing is, I don’t wanna play Nuclear Winter and level up, and I don’t wanna run around like a chicken with my head cut off grabbing enough desk fans so that I can fulfill my daily screw quota. There’s no new content and they dropped this bomb on us. I think I might be completely done until next expansion, but props to you for sticking around.
---
Take a seat, swig back a nukashine, black out on hard liquor and nuclear material...
---
Wake up dazed and confused just in time to realize you got a massive hangover... in the twilight zone.
---
Yeah, for not playing PvP?
---
Cool. I don't care. 
---
Go back to CoD if you want real PvP.
---
You're just another kid in the whole collection who doesn't know what else to do, and think you are so godly for killing poor level 5 Jimmy over there.
---
You have nothing to say if that is how you value people or games.
---
Yeah I checked last night, it's gone. I can't recall where I got it from though. 
---
Has anyone purchased the Revolutionary Free States faction bundle since the update? That contains a salute emote by the looks of things. It's not one I own.
---
Don’t you HAVE to pay to participate in fortnite’s battle pass? I could be wrong but that was my understanding. Or at least you must pay to get all rewards.
---
The whole point behind SCORE system - is to stop paying Atoms to players.
---
You really should listen to yourself.
---
What are you, like 12?
---
Sometimes I feel as if the Community, The Devs and the Shareholders at Zenimax are 3 entities in a stuggle for the soul of 76
---
You get a set from the BoS quest line.
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
Thats all I have to say to scum like you.
---
Something is wrong with how you are going into build mode then. It shouldn’t switch you out of 1st person.
---
Theyve taken away aprox 5000 atoms over the next 10 weeks and now you are forced into getting only the rewards they choose on their seasons board game. 
---
Its awful and just another money grab. 
---
Ive defended this game so so long but this mat be my breaking point.
---
They keep taking away the good things we have and giving us some new form of a grind (scrip, bullion, treasury notes and now score)
---
Daily challenges kept me playing and i knew i could earn maybe one nice bundle a month from atoms. But id get to pick what i wanted. 
---
Now we get that taken away and get forced caps and lunch boxes and scrap kits?
---
*Queue Dramatic Exit*
---
Lmao. What happened to your other comments?
---
You sir are A gentleman and a scholar
---
I know on xbox you can! Just go to Amazon and buy a code. Then you can send the code to your friend. You might be able to with ps4 too. Not sure. I get them for my better half all the time. Better yet they arent taxed on Amazon and you can use an amazon giftcard.
---
Bye
---
Hey man if you bulk up the junk on a tinkers bench then scrap it back down that counts for the challenges. Saves alot of running around and hassle
---
What does that mean? He asked how I knew, I told him. I'm stating facts.
---
They gave away the Battle Pass for free back in season 8 or so. If you saved the 1500 V-Bucks you earn that season, you'd be able to have free Battle Passes for the foreseeable future.
---
Forgive my english....I was a hunting rifle user...When I read something about gauss rifles is good. I switch to that...Spend a lot of resources to scrap till I get some nice parts...Tried on a level 3 bandit..use VATS in front of him....I switch back to my hunting rifle.....
---
Its not available for PC :(
---
the game likely will only have so many enemies in one area at a time, but im only guessing why people were doing it ive not experienced people doing this
---
Just let it scrap ammo.
---
Like 10-20 bullets makes 1 lead and 1 gunpowder.
---
Problem solved.
---
MATHLETES UNITE!
---
Sorry. I can't math 😟
---
 TIE fighter 😊
---
More proof that you’re like 12.
---
I find people who brag like that are usually fairly invite and really aren’t who or what they claim to be.
---
As Teddy Roosevelt once said, “walk softly, but carry a big stick.”
---
I had no idea, thanks for telling me that.
---
Weekly challenges are worth 33% of your total score gain, If you dont log on everyday you lose up to 66% of score gain for the week. You can make it up though by grinding out 1.4m exp every week.
---
Full screen pip boy? Not found that one yet.
---
There's a bug that spawns one of the missing equipment objects in the world.  If you pick it up (and have it in your inventory, maybe?) It autocompletes the quest every time.  Congrats!
---
There is literally only one laser that does that and even pvpers complain about it. Every other explosive laser can be dealt with by using the right perk cards and armor mods.
---
ok ty! i may just cancel and wait until we know for sure~
---
This is not an airport no need to announce your departure. Just leave.
---
i like the clean sink
---
Most people I searched up on says around 100+ to get everything. I didn't count but I feel like the number is about right. Good luck and don't burn yourself out.
---
you mean bake? ;)
---
and seasons 1-7? Don’t you only get “free” battle passes if you earned them in previous seasons? So one way or another you need to have paid some money above and beyond initial game purchase to participate.
---
Yes. I need the ability to bake bread.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I will take 50 euros worth of what you are smoking please. Will pm address for delivery.
---
try soundhound-ing it or shazam i think it’s called
---
That’s exactly what I did, first time doing that event. Yet I was the one that launched the nuke lol (wasted pretty much all my resources trying to launch the nuke)
---
Yes, something is not right, maybe I'm bugged. But you can see how it just adds to the frustration of the whole thing. If the game would just let you repair what you have the material for at the "repair all".
---
Lasers effected by the furious damage bugs were the first things to knock me down with my current build and I have never bothered to get one myself.
---
Sometimes it is not possible. For example when required skill is higher than yours. Just like it was shown on the screenshot.
---
Oh yeah that’s right I totally forgot the “constant”
---
Raise. My bad
---
It isnt designed to make money, it does change the way the currency works in the game by providing less of it and allowing players to buy ranks. I'm not gonna say that Beth are angels and they did this for us because they love us and it's perfect, ofcourse some influence of making money was into it because they are a business. If they had no influence of money then every rank up would provide cosmetics or you would still be able to gain atoms while the score pass. 
---
What I see is that Beth saw many people complaining that nothing was motivating them to do anything so they released two features that went hand in hand with each other, and lessend the amount of atoms earned to balance the business side of thing. The public teams motivate people to work together and do more with each other due to the buffs and the score rewards them for doing so and gives them something to do. 
---
The very idea of a battle pass is grinding, especially if you want to complete all of it and complaining that it's a grind is like complaining that running tires you out. What people need to realise is the severity OF the grinding, for me it seems fine so far and the numbers dont match on this subreddit with different posts providing different numbers and opinions so the severity of it is something I have yet to decide personally.
---
You can press "view button" (IIRC it is \[V\] by default) to switch pip-boy to power armor style  interface.

Bloatfly bread?
---
I am smoking the good bread.
---
I wasn't bragging. It's literally a fact. 
---
But okay. Enjoy being condescending. 👍👍
---
Bloatfly, garlic, corn, I just require bread baking.
---
Bethesda's entire oversight was the mode itself. Whenever the game is free, the mode is packed with players but for some reason it doesn't click with Bethesda, nobody is going to buy a $40 Battle Royale. Not when there are plenty of (almost every) free ones out there that are much better. 
---
The mode should be free to play (COD has shown its possible to have a free mode in a paid game) and that's what Nuclear Winter needs. Otherwise it's never going to get any better
---
That’s alright, everyday insult bot comes to my camp and destroys stuff until I kill him, guess that’s his new way of insulting you
---
Well to answer your question in a more general matter the problem with the pass is that you will be short of do even if Doing ALL dailies and weeklies. 
---
So skipping out on the NW one really only makes further  behind. 
---
I wouldn’t can’t calculate that right now for some reason. But you’ll be left out on 7000xp per month if just missing one daily
---
The problem is you could potentially end up with floating structures. I don’t know how to workaround that
---
adiós amigo de la bóveda espero que algún día te des cuenta de que la rutina no es tan mala
---
If anyone in this thread and is on xbox, I will happily 1v1 you and beat you if I don't know you. Lmao
---
Apparently saying that means I'm 12, but I'll prove it if you need me to for some unknown reason.
---
You really need to learn to be more mature and better understand the words you are trying to use.
---
Because you keep using the word “fact,” and you’ve proven that you don’t understand the definition of the word.
---
See, I can also say that I am the #1 PvP’er in Fallout 76.
---
Prove that I’m not.
---
And while you do that, also try to prove unicorns don’t exist.
---
Because literally everything posted here, without actual evidence, is “just your opinion, man.”
---
Bloatfly loaf is just meatloaf not bread loaf
---
I'm in an extremely remote location with extremely limited internet in terms of bandwidth and data limit. It took me 2 months to download the game. I finally got to play enough to get to level 20... I was enjoying it.
---
However,  I was mortified when i was hit with this new update.  This 60+ Gb update will take 2 more months of data/ time. 
---
Sorry my dudes, but I'm bailing on this until I can get somewhere with faster internet.... or until Starlink finally goes public.
---
Okay. My GT is swiseWHAT - let's PvP.
---
I’m not alone, I want to vent my frustration.
---
Feel free to not click posts that don’t appeal to you, you knew what this was when you started reading.
---
This can happen when a nuke zone vanishes and the game spawns in new mobs. Most noticable in areas with a high mob rate.
---
The Whitesprings and Fissure Site Prime are such places and since the Glassed Cavern is basically below FSP, eyebots gonna get you.
---
haha always someone asks this
---
It is a FACT that if I do not know you on xbox, you will not beat me. That is how I KNOW I am a top PvP player on Fallout 76 on XBOX. 
---
Sorry if that somehow makes me immature. Lmao, grow up dude. You have zero points to make here. You're just picking a fight for no reason.
---
Nice.
---
Russian translation failed me. I legitimately thought I was eating bread made of bloatfly.
---
Why do you feel the need to tell us your leaving the game. Nobody cares. Too many people constantly bitching and moaning about the game just leave if you dont like it. Dont need an essay
---
No they aren't dropping. 
---
I've gained over 27k XP, unlocked the Christmas and Halloween stuff but no VTU stuff.
---
the quote which isn’t offensive is Bye Felicia
---
So yesterday i grinded out the points to get the ammo converter. Today i did all the daily challenges and finished up the week challenges while in a team and only am able to move up one space...wtf is going on! Can anyone help me understand if im missing something that i can do to get more xp😓
---
Hahahahahahahaha....wow, you do get triggered rather easily.
---
Seriously dude, you’re a god in your own mind and an opinion is like your butt, everybody has one.
---
I understand the confusion I have the fallout cookbook that is the only reason why I know this one lol
---
Here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSzfAWPhodo&amp;
---
SCORE supply packages not appearing after being claimed.
---
Please check previous posts, this has come up a lot.
---
Weekly challenges are rewarding progress before you complete them, say at like 3/5 completion.
---
Did you get the score at 3/5 for those couple with sub challenges? They are bugged and awarding score early and not when it finally gets to 5/5. You should add up total score earned and compare against your dailies and weeklies + xp repeatable if you can.
---
Lots of people care and I gave my reasons in the post.
---
I want other people to be aware that Seasons is a disaster and if they feel like me they shouldn’t continuing paying.
---
Why did you read it if you didn’t care? My title was very obvious about the content of the post.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Workshops?
---
Probably due to the spam.
---
Yes,thank you for the info
---
If you say so bud. Keep chatting shit. I cba, tbh.
---
Honestly this describes how I've felt about 76 as of late as well. I logged on to check it out but after grinding through quite a few daily just to move 2spots on the board, yea probably to causal to get anything off that stupid board game other than the ammo converter because hopefully they fix it. Other than that yea sorry but it's grindy AF.
---
Omg. You have my nocturnal rolling pin?
---
Yes greedy. They said that you would be able to receive atoms when you play the game.. while you still get them (1/4th what you did before) let's take a closer look at that. First they removed atom rewards from most game challenges, the ones that initially rewarded you roughly 4000 atoms when you first played and leveled a character (one time only), argument was "you still have world challenges", one time only mind you. Then they decided to break another promise by adding non-cosmetic items to atomshop to get even more atom purchases. After that, they thought it would be a good idea to introduce monthly/yearly subscriptions with fallout 1st, another cash grab. Now they removed all the atom rewards from daily/weekly challenges to push even more atom sales. And their argument is that you will now get cosmetic items for free and "you still have world challenges", ones most of us have already done. The problem is that you do not have zero choice what you get anymore. Unless you pay up and buy atoms. This game is not running for free. We all had to buy it and i would argue majority of us are paying the FO1st subscription already. There are people who will buy atoms, even now. Ones that did not have time to farm every daily/weekly before, and play casually. The revenue they get from subscriptions, game sales, and atom purchases should be ebough.. But nooooooo....
---
If you purchased the Battle Pass from season 2 onward, you earned 1500 V-Bucks if you got to max level. Each subsequent Battle Pass costed 950 V-Bucks. So as long as you saved your V-Bucks, you could pay for every single Battle Pass from 2017 until today and still have 550 V-Bucks each season to spend in the store.
---
Never got the chance to before so thought I'd try my luck this time :p
---
I think it's just a name - it doesn't mean you literally have to spend the entire time building.
---
I think they just wanted a name to differentiate it from other teams with more specific aims. For example, if you join an events team, the implication is that you want to do events and will try and do most of the events that show up on the server with your team. Building in the game is a solo thing aside from private teams, so there's more of an understanding that you can just do your own thing and get the buffs to Int (and therefore XP).
---
I don't understand what you're asking but will try to help.
---
Are you asking if items will be removed in the sense of not being able to *use* them after this Season? Or in the sense of not being able to *obtain* them after this Season? 
---
It's possible some of the rewards will be offered in the atom shop or as another reward in the future. But a lot of the rewards aren't even items per se....like the atoms and gold. 
---
Why would you have to uninstall? Bc you might not get all the rewards? If you just started 3 months ago you've already missed out on things from other events so what's the difference?
---
Felt compelled to respond to your nonsense. Not everyone hates it so don't try speaking for everyone
---
Jeez I must be lucky, it’s happened every single time. Like 15-20 times now. Lucky me!
---
The ammo converter is just a joke. A really bad one.
---
Also, if you want to AFK/ bush jump for exp, for the love of Atom, please solo queue.
---
I disproved that the plans do not drop after learning the Elder paint plan from somewhere else.   After leaning initiate and Knight* plans, I went through a dry spell and wasn’t getting any plan drops from the event.  A friend hooked me up with an Elder plan which I then learned.  Yesterday I had 3 Officer plans drop.  
---
Anyone want to trade an Officer plan for Paladin?
---
Of course it's there to make money. Otherwise it wouldnt have the option to buy levels, including **all** of them as Bethesda point out constantly.
---
I've had a couple where the ring has closed on the Toxic Valley at the top, but it's quite rare.
---
I don't know if it's by design that it tends towards the middle or just a natural effect of how the maths works in the game that it tends towards the middle. I guess it probably gives a more fair game experience than if one edge of the map was favoured every time.
---
I never once said I speak for everyone, but a lot of people share my issues.
---
I felt compelled to share how I was feeling about state of the game just as you felt compelled to share what you felt of my post. Which I support you doing, I’d only ask you support me in my opinions too.
---
I’ve spent a lot money on this game and I am entitled to voice my concerns when I feel the game has lost its way... further.
---
So I was right that you need to pay into the system to participate, if you don’t earn/save enough premium currency you need to pay again...
---
Yea that’s a no thanks from me.
---
The problem is that no one knows why the make the choices they make.  I don't doubt that there are multiple reasons seasons are designed as they are with the grind as it is.  Same with the ammo converter.  Yeah the interface is clunky but perhaps they needed to design it that was to battle duping?  I don't know more than anyone else in that sense but it's reasonable to assume that they made decisions based on info we don't know about.
---
I get your point but if there wasnt a continuous revenue stream than the game would just peeter out. I think as were only 48 hours into season 1 we should let it ride a bit before passing judgement. The non cosmetic items in atom shop I guess you mean repair kits. These are easily farmed in game at SBQ
---
If it was there to make money then they would have fortnite'd it and added a premium battle pass, which I am genuinely surprised they didnt.
---
5 bucks he will be back at the end of the month.
---
Oh okay that might be true. But non the less, atoms is gone
---
What a fucking fantastic community I love it here
---
Legendary perks were supposed to come summer 2019.
---
Not holding my breath for this.
---
It's not mine but I'm curious to know what weapon could be so special as to go through this much trouble. Doubt the owner will ever be found. To the scrip she goes, lads.
---
I am easily triggered right now too because I love this game and the community we've built as PvP players and this new update took away any desire to play anymore. 
---
Team PvP was the only thing I did in game besides test builds &amp; prep for PvP. It's sad AF for my friends and I. 😔
---
Yes but you rant and rave on here how you will leave but you wont. I bet I could find you in game still. That's the point, share your dislikes if you want but saying your leaving is of no relevance
---
I think they balanced it to include accuracy more in the calculations. i notice huge, huge improvements with perks and gun mods that improve accuracy
---
that's good to hear, with daily challenges + weekly challenges, it would be possible to beat the guy
---
as far as i knew events were reocuring! for example this fasnacht was here before i think. and i need to uninstall bc i dont like to be forced to grind for stuff that (unlike fasnacht, bordelands 3 and most overwatch events for example) both incenivises spending and can never be got again should they not be got in a game i already paid for. i was willing to make exception for 1st (and only 1st, i make no other atom purchases) bc to me there is value and i dont feel idk what the word would be. “cheated” is all that comes to mind but may be wrong. its the same with destiny 2. rly tho that isnt relevent i think i just went on a tangent, rlly all i wanna know is if the battlepass is like halos or fortnite. sry for confusing im not rly the best at writing~
---
So like Fallout 76, only with a mandatory $60 buy-in. Until it's available on Game Pass on Xbox and PC next week, at least.
---
Unfortunately, it was nice to be able to earn one pack every 2-3 weeks. Tbh I would still buy the occasional with real money anyway.
---
The thing that sucks about the way they have the “SCORE” system for this Legendary Run is you HAVE TO play almost EVERYDAY to unlock everything without paying! 
---
I’m already two days behind because things have gone to hell at work the last couple days and I’ll miss four more next week when I go out of town! And it’s already designed to where you may not complete it even if you don’t miss a single day!
---
i got the elder paint a week ago so ye they still drop
---
😂😂😂😂, well said
---
Does this mean my Bethesda Xbox profile will be available on PC?
---
It was really nice indeed...
---
i wouldn't even mind the grind if the fucking challenges weren't bugged and not adding S.C.O.R.E.
---
Cool. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Once I've seen it do that
---
That makes even more sense since weapon accuracy is part of that calculation. You can no longer half ass a vats build you have to have highly accurate weapons too.
---
Give them time
---
Downvoted for this comment? Hahah wow people can be fucked up.
---
just venture nearer to fissure prime.  When group is in rad zone she lands often.
---
why sit on a fence/tent outside the blast zone. That's da permanoob easy way :)
---
That's the point.. There is a continuous revenue stream in place already. People have been buying atoms all along, and for sometime now paying for subscriptions. And yes, score system has only been up for 48 hours, but you can easily calculate the time/effort requirements and amount of atoms you lose during the nest 10 weeks. Repair kits and the other nonsense kit. Casual players don't farm Queen, same ones that hurt the most with this new system. There are people buying them from store.
---
[Piss off](https://imgur.com/a/h1l1ktI) why would I make a post about cancelling and stepping away if I wasn’t doing it.
---
Until then I will not say that it is a cash grab because compared to other free battle passes, this gives so much.
---
When do they drop the rug or plushie?
---
Absolutely agree. I'd hoped Wastlanders was going to introduce something like that. You wouldn't need to create full blown animosity like WoW but it would at least have some purposeful rivalry in the game. Not that I'm interested in pvp but it would have at least given it a point beyond just griefing and could have made it more appealing. I also prefer the idea of not being able to obtain everything on one character. It adds variety rather than servers full of level 500+ bloodied builds in SS armor.
---
Oh look, im not saying its all 100% greed but people seem to be acting surprise that YES there is a money motivation
---
I wouldn't overthink it. Do you think roleplayers really need the charisma?
---
The update was about 10GB on PS4
---
11 GB on Xbox 
---
4.8 GB on Steam 
---
4 GB on Bnet
---
Why do you even play the game? Every negative comment comes from you. Just delete the game and move on with your life.
---
Lost it at *entities*. I need to use this word more.
---
Except for the SBQ there is no dmg limit to get the loot. Vats-tag the legendaries, or bullet-spray everything and you are good.
---
But I understand your frustration.
---
not all quests are events.
---
It does help massively accuracy (and range too) it's all part of the calculation that is why people notice it more with gauss weapons and shotguns since they have low accuracy.
---
It's not a bug that gauss weapons shoot over people's heads or the torso.
---
That’s buying the game, the seasons are some additional cosmetic content. The core game of 76 is slightly more deep than fortnite lol
---
Oh I had to get the Stars and Stripes banner. I’m not even patriotic necessarily it was just obligatory
---
Except that there is a damage cap you have to hit from the SBQ... some say 1000 other day 10k damage needed. 
---
And I can confirm. 
---
If I don’t pull out my lmg on the queen I never get any loot.
---
Haven't tested but I think I will use AutoHotKey on this. I already use it for some stuff in this game.
---
Yeah I don't see why people are so surprised. Ofcourse any live service game is going to do that to earn a lil bit of cash.
---
Thanks I'll try that, still things I've not found out in this game.
---
So it's day 2 and I'm already behind few hundres of points because I do not play NW. Great.
---
Fok dat shiet.
---
This is precisely what you need to do to signal to Bethesda to step up and do better. The loss of money is the only thing Bethesda is responsive towards.
---
Int... even a single point will give you a bit more xp, so if you have enough and get enough xp, don't join those groups.
---
 So *that*'s new Colin Robinson's new job then, at bethesda game design!
---
My situation is that I didn't take the risk.
---
not mine, but during an incredibly laggy SBQ fight, in my haste to use a rad away i went into inventory and dropped my troubleshooters, explosive, reduced weight mini gun. not amazing, but made me sad
---
But have you fixed the floating cup in the air near mama dolces?
---
Probably cause they have something better 😅
---
Lucky for you, there are plenty of PvP-specific games out there.
---
I guess a lot of PvP’ers are upset that their store-bought legacies are worth just about zero now.
---
You mean they should walk around with heavy armors inside their base doing nothing? :) Doesn't make any sense why they should.
---
Ive had a few close in around the grafton dam.
---
LMAO Ghillie ghillie.
---
Ignore the goober below... This game isn’t as bad as people say it is. It might be an internet issue on your end, or just a server issue. Just gotta keep trying.
---
Had a level 6 ghoul take 3 2700 headshots and still kept coming.
---
1 respawn cycle. 
---
For the game to spawn in new mobs the area must be empty.
---
Empty, in this game, means that no player can be in it. 
---
A player is considered to be in the area when they are visible on the map. If you crouch, you are not visible on the map, therefor the game "thinks" the area is empty and a new spawn cycle can begin. 
---
Basically, kill every hostile and leave for \~20 minutes or so. Not sure about the exact amount of time.
---
Or kill every hostile, crouch to be hidden from the map and watch new spawns appear out of thin air with your own eyes. Again, after roughly 20 minutes OR when a new player enters the area.
---
I'm not sure about the 20 minutes, I just put that there because that's roughly in line with how long it takes me to kill mobs in about 5 places and circle back to the first one.
---
Makes it easy to find the bodies too
---
it is for me at least
---
Lol yup! Level 1 bloatfly by my camp took over 10k damage before finally dying to one shot from my ally. The rage is real
---
Pretty sure other bloodied players already using it, why they wouldn't
---
that would mean acknowledging NV's existence
---
&gt; TL;DR : The wastelanders grind and season progression actually made the game worse for me and I've been playing it less and less. 
---
This is a judgment only you can make. As the famous computer game designer Julius Caesar once wrote: "De gustibus non est disputandem."
---
My only comment is not a criticism, but an observation: As you describe it, your game play seems to be entirely geared toward maximizing your own efficiency and speed in achieving particular game goals, as defined by Bethesda's events, rewards systems, etc. 
---
And I get that — a great man of us are playing this game (rather than some other one) is because we tend a bit toward obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the never-ending attempt to maximize our efficiency in getting all the "right" puzzle pieces properly seated and all the check-boxes ticked actually scratches an itch for us. 
---
But have you tried *deliberately abandoning Bethesda's goals, and instead setting your own?* 
---
When I do that, I see the game and my gameplay through a different set of lenses. If I set as my goal for one game session that I want to find, and help out, a handful of low-level characters — for instance, helping them identify, and then plug, gaps in their gear, or complete some quest that has them stumped, or whatever — I find myself pretty well satisfied with my time investment. And that's been true for me even when in consequence of spending time doing that, I haven't \[also\] achieved the maximum feasible \[atoms/XP/legendary loot drops/faction/SBQ kills/*Bethesda-defined goals*\] that I previously had defined as "success."
---
If you try seeing the game anew through this different set of lenses, and still say "I'm not enjoying this," then you'll certainly have given the game all its owed. 
---
For most of us — leaving aside, I suppose, the lifelong chess fans or the like — *every* game eventually becomes "that game I used to play, but don't anymore." If you conclude now is the time when Fallout 76 becomes that game you used to play, no one can or should second-guess that or try to talk you out of it.
---
It’s not the weapon in particular; I just know how much time and energy I have personally invested into getting some of the gear that I have, like legacies for example... it’s not a terrible weapon though. I put on my cards for it and it never did less than 1k damage per attack.
---
I have to admit I mostly forget about sharing perks. If somebodoy asks, I do share if I can.
---
clearing an items name does allow you to rename something else, but putting it into your stash does not
---
Ballistic weave maybe?
---
Yes. So we can play D-D-D-Duel Monsters!
---
GARY?
---
The issue is the ignorant fools who still funds the devs through Fallout 1st and thinks it's a good value when in fact with every additional whale throwing money at the worst mtx(fallout 1st) which enables the devs to keep cutting off base features of the game and continue to monetize every little base feature that should have been in the game from the start as a "new premium feature". I have stopped playing Fallout 76 since January 2019 and only come recently to finish through Wastelanders on Steam to which I'm done with that content, uninstalled and plan to indefinitely never touch Fallout 76 again(many people have done the same). Fallout 76 is still the same shitty Fallout 76 from 2018 after you are done with the Wastelanders content, nothing prior to Wastelanders have been changed for the better and now I'm seeing random threads like this coming up on my reddit feed which indicates that Fallout 76 is still becoming worse and worse by the month.
---
This franchise is fucked...
---
Also Xbox, having similar problems, although it hasn't crashed on me yet (knock on wood). It's straight-up painful to watch, but that may also be the sheer amount of explosions + photosensitivity. Urgh.
---
Actually just completed one of these, wonder if you're in my server, and also sorry.
---
Because you would just leave not write an essay about it
---
If I’m concerned about someone starting it I just stay at the terminal, ready to initiate recall
---
So everyone else is playing the game wrong and should change and carry different weapons so you have a chance to hit enemies.. Instead of you yourself getting a better weapon, like automatic lets say tesla rifle for quickly tagging everything in sight. Entitled much?
---
Why not play nuclear winter?
---
I was standing right in front of it at the time tbh as I usually do
---
Every point of int=2% more exp :)
---
Read the fucking post and you’ll see why I made it.
---
Jesus Christ how can you be this dense.
---
I wanted to vent my frustrations at something that I really enjoyed and invest a lot of time and money in.
---
I'm adamant something isnt right with the score system especially how public events dont award anything so I'm waiting to see before judging
---
That deserves a lot of F’s damn
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6FVk2k4qsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6FVk2k4qsM)
---
So what is stopping you using that LMG? I can only see person who is to blame here.
---
And I'm telling you nobody gives a fuck. If you want dense look in the mirror
---
YEAH. That was fucking weird. 
---
It was that day that began my personal quest to hunt all FO76 cryptids.
---
No limit although I saw people who thought that all challenges are repeatable, which they are not. Only the "get 10000 XP" one is repeatable.
---
No limit. That challenge awarded it when you completed 3/5 of the sub challenges so when you finished and got 5/5 it didn’t award
---
Moaning hahahahaha
---
I see your Gauss minigun and raise you that dude we had yesterday at SBQ, Line in the Sand and Uranium fever who, despite repeatedly being asked to tone it down, kept mowing down everything with what looked like an explosive gatling plasma, thus depriving everyone else of just about all kill XP and a bunch of legendary drops.
---
Yea, ofcourse all the calculations we have seen are based on the information we have right now. But it sure looks to me that they are correct.
---
Well obviously they need to make money. Some games make enough money when they release that they can quite easily support their game with constant content for years without making a dent in their profits. as poorly received as 76 was it still sold quite a lot of units.
---
The thing I’m trying to explain to you is that you don’t need a game design based on depriving players of the ability to complete something so that they have to give you money. Some of the most successful games on the market have a much more player friendly system. Path of exile and warframe are two good example. 
---
Destiny is a game where you can pay for passes but you can easily smash out a good session and make some serious progress, I made 5 levels in the space of an hour. The last destiny season I started 1 week late and left 3 weeks before it finished and end on 187/100. I nearly completed it twice and I was a month behind.
---
 
---
The problem with fallout first (I currently have it btw) is it isn’t very good value, the only reason I currently have it is for the scrap box. $23 AUD a month for the scrap box. I never use the Private world and will use it even less with this new group system (which I really like).
---
this thread is basically a fanboy thread it seems
---
I had the same shit yesterday, but on "Project Paradise", 3 players with level 100+. an lvl 19 arrives and just starts the event. of course we lost because the other two 100+ players did not know what to do. and the lvl 19 guy dies every 10 seconds.
---
I lost the team-up emote , hopefully they fix it soon I used it a lot on nw
---
The only AR skin I've seen is the Halloween bats one that you get from nuclear winter. Unless you really like pink and/or bats it's pretty lame tbh
---
All of these problems fall on every one who bought the game expecting anything different. Bethesda has been doing this for over a decade and people still buy the games. The only way they get the message is to not buy their broken games, but instead people buy them and piss and moan. If you're not prepared to wade through shit to play the game, you shouldn't be buying a Bethesda game.
---
Is there a cap on this? I heard that it caps at 25 Intel
---
"not as many as this" is actually the perfect argument, because it's spot-on. not many triple A games out there are as bad as Fo76. and the ones that are subject to the same ridicule, because they deserve it.
---
&gt;Now to all these moaners out there. Just stop.
---
you're not doing the game any favors by pretending everything's dandy. because it's not.
---
oh, and those fixer plans were probably duped.
---
I have zero inclination to try and get to level 100, what I get is what I get. But god do I get tired of posts from middle aged dudes sucking off corporate entities
---
BOS
---
yep i was more referring to the roadmap which came out with wastelanders but yes i would be surprised if it actually comes before 2021
---
Fought the Wendigo for the first time yesterday. We all killed the queen and I just wandered the nuke zone a little and got to the weird trees area and saw a bunch of Wendigos and this tall creature. I was the only one so created a group and just did emotes and pretty soon there was a ton of us.
---
You realize that saying pts is indie is asinine right? Blizzard has done them for years, critique their games all you want, but they are one of the biggest developers in the world.
---
I have no idea. Tbh I just learned int=exp buff in 76 yesterday.
---
Because Regs doesn't do favourites. You want Secret Service armor? Hand over the gold, motherfucker.
---
I personally think when we get to season 2 there will be extra rewards available for first members. I think season 1 is a trial run. In essence season 2 I think will have a free season pass that unlocks certain things for free as you progress but if you pay for 1st you get full access
---
We also need the Gillie Pup Mask to complete the Ghillie jockstrap/Ghillie Harness aesthetic if you catch my drift
---
Rng is so shitty
---
OK Karen, as you like 😍
---
What one is that?
---
The real solution right here.
---
id enjoy it more if i could see my friends or teammates stand out on the map instead of blue-circled-randoms everywhere
---
Testing required!😂
---
I run my Intel between 26-29 so I should be able soon if it boosts over 25
---
That's something that would not occur in another community. Fallout 76 may be hated, but the community is one of the best!
---
crafting explosives.
---
Yeah sorry they only reply a few times on official posts and then *poof* they're gone until next patch.
---
We are many that want to know !
---
Keep fighting the good fight! Your a saint my friend.
---
&gt; But it requires exponentially more score
---
Please read up on what exponentially means, the increase in needed S.C.O.R.E. is merely linear. Sure, it will still take 3400-ish points for the level-up from 99 to 100, but that boils down to one and a half day's available S.C.O.R.E. points plus 40k exp for the repeatable.
---
Doable.
---
Duping isn't a problem here, specially since there hasn't been a weapon dupe in over a year now! This is just punishing players who have too many legendaries!
---
I think this is just saying challenges may include completing public events. Honestly though it should just be anything you do gets a little score. Kill an enemy, finish a quest, collect an overseer log. Whatever normal things people do when playing
---
Truth
---
Use the bush Wookiee suit or the veteran ranger gear. They both blend in with bushes very well. And if you’re just gonna hide the entire time, join solo.
---
This is what I’m going to be using it for. I build a ton and know some great building tricks. I’ve been starting a building team, having people fast travel to me at a workshop, and putting on legit demonstrations of how to build better. Some with step by step instructions like how to build underground camps, wire your camps better, merge objects, etc.
---
K
---
I've been playing a year and a half and literally have no idea how to share perk cards lol. Today was my first time ever joining a team. It was.. Pretty great!
---
I'm on xbox and havent been on in a couple of weeks so it isnt mine, but mega props to you. What do you plan on doing with it if the owner is never found?
---
He didn't say the specifics bc if it's a BE25 gatling plasma or a B2525 fixer I can guarantee that 60% of comments whould be just asking for it saying that they are the owner.
---
Really a man of quality.
---
I'm on PS4 and when I did this last night it became a total slideshow. It was impossible to aim and I had to rely on VATS, which barely works most of the time. Total nightmare.
---
Does it make a difference staying on the terminal?.I didn't think it did??? They can still access it
---
My salute disappeared when I purchased the Fly Boy emote...
---
And I know I purchased the Salute emote as well. 
---
So sad ..
---
man if they really make us wait even more for something a mod already does...
---
No subscription?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st 
---
Is that not a subscription.
---
Exactly. They shouldn't care who joins the team. If they did, the should make a private team. I'm level 191, and one of my teammates last night was level 12. I ended up joining him on Feed the People...which had over ten people participating at the end. I don't think I've ever had that with more than one other.
---
The moral of the story is that I don't care that a level 12 was on my team. Good for them for playing.
---
Get the glow mod for plants. It was a serious QOL improvement all around for food plus flora
---
It came as a freebie a few weeks back.  Can't remember if it was one of those daily login freebies that they were doing for a week, or just one of the weekly giveaways.  Anyway, I have a raider salute in its place, which I assume came from the Raider Waster Bundle I picked up last week, but looking at the bundle right now, it doesn't appear to come with an emote.  Anyone else have a random raider salute emote?
---
This!!
---
I cancelled my fallout 1st when I saw the update coming.
---
Lots of people give a fuck, as you said the entire sub is full of people who give a fuck which is why you’re now crying like a bitch and wetting the bed that someone could dare have an issue with the game
---
Here’s the apologist position: Out of the thousands of games out there, you’re still playing 76, so how can it be as awful as you claim?
---
It is optional, by subscription I mean like WoW or FF14.
---
Heart of the enemy. Pays 8 scrip each time and you can run it as many times as you want.
---
Many use bloody builds
---
Yeah I thought it might be the amount of explosions. Well I got kicked out and then got pulled back into the same world due to the events team. So not sure if I'm in the same server as you.
---
I didn't see any difference while using that camo.
---
Nobody gives a fuck your leaving moron.
---
just throw a bunch of humans and PAs into a FEV vat
---
No you can kill the other Mothmen if you do enough damage in the first shot!
---
How big headed  are you if you actually think people give a shit if you stay on the game or leave
---
I never joined a team before, and forgot this was an option until last night. Went in to change a perk card, and had Inspirational shared with me. I only have 4 charisma, but I was able to share a level 1 Pack Rat. Maybe it helped someone!
---
Both erbivore and carnivore now give double bonuses....go nuts.
---
They was last night I was still getting stuff
---
Ah, yeah that was probably it. I definitely don't have a raider salute, but then I don't own any of those bundles either.
---
Pc.....hahaha. Lol
---
Well does it still work now ?
---
I know it can be annoying but to get the game were it is now and will be is because of those "moaners". Do you really think Bethesda would have added NPC's without the community complaining? Of course not or we would have had them from the start. 
---
And honestly the game will only improve if the community gives feedback and if bethesda wouldn't always do these half ass shit they fabricating then there would be more positive Feedback.
---
And don't get me wrong not everything is bad i love Wastelanders, the public teams are great. But nonetheless there so many reoccurring bugs and annoyances it's unbelievable. And its an AA Title with a subscription and an in game shop i mean come on. They could do a lot better if they would take it more seriously 
---
Without the community the game would be nothing and i really mean nothing
---
Not sure but I can test in a minute
---
It’s technically optional but that scrap box one day will Basically be essential because they haven’t increased the size of stash box. For now it’s optional.
---
Ok thank you I’m just not at home at the moment so I just wanna know if I should get to grinding nuclear winter as soon as I’m back
---
You can, if someone is on the terminal, you access it with your pipboy!
---
Slidy bars..lol...
---
Good fucking luck 
---
You realize who you are dealing with right.
---
Lmfao!!!!!
---
Escalators! Escalators!
---
So from my experience you just have to be in a team for the bond to increase. It doesn’t matter where you are, your bond will increase regardless. Also, the XP boost applies to any event you complete, but you have to be in it and complete it. I don’t think you get any XP when your teammates do an event and your not there. So just join as many events as possible.
---
I think this is actually the most welcoming game/community out there right now. It's definitely been my go to comfort game for a good while now for a good reason
---
You need to proper legendary effects on your weapon (like bloodied, instigating, junkies etc) and all the damage related perks to see it "shred" like you described. Just having all ranks of Heavy Gunner perks and stabilized is not enough to maximize your damage.
---
I had a last stand ontop of a nuked Grafton dam last night, was epic!
---
actually I could see a ghillie tent / ghillie generator / ghillie stash box / and ghillie protectron as a realistic addition to the game as something I could actually see in the game of survivors making who want to go unnoticed by raiders / scroch / ect ect 
---
that said at least I'll use the ghillie stuff the captain cosmo suits not so much
---
(On PC)
---
Lol......,
---
Yet here you are crying and demanding people not criticise the game, this isn’t communist China fuckwad
---
Done with you now.
---
I'd honestly be pissed if I have to grind everyday to reach lvl 100 ,while some dude is gonna buy the last reward for free atoms in 3 months.
---
At least you can't use them in NW.
---
If you read my comment you'd see that I said exactly that about the sbq.
---
It’ll be left to collect dust in the stash of a bank alt... i’ll look at it from time to time, as I do with most legendaries while transferring stuff, and I’ll say “oh yeah! I forgot I even have this.”
---
I try to team up, but if everyone refuses to communicate, I may as well hide!
---
Still glitched.
---
Laughs with 30 k atoms....😂😂😂
---
Already Scrapped and forgotten
---
One can love and still critisize. Constructive critisism can be a sign of caring. Besides, people are allowed to expect a functioning game, more so when they paid for it and some even pay a monthly subscription. Dismissing legitimate critisism by calling it moaning, doesn't make the problems go away and is bad for the longevity of the game.
---
I found him asleep on one of the beds in Vault 79 last night....
---
Busuness is business, but as a buyer what would you prefer more: cost-efficient well made product or cheap-ass scam one? 
---
I think Witcher 3 is perfect example of good entertainment value and price. Yep they had trouble with bugs and stuff, but they fixed it. What do we have there? Some games in EA feels more complete than this. Its laughable. 
---
Jusifying common ill practices in this industry ain't good for all of us as we get less quality product overall at the end of the day. FO76 showing it just perfectly - many many broken stuff and cherry on top of it (atomic shop). Very sad that devs forgetting - quality always pays off.
---
Thanks friend 🙏 Ill get to grinding That straight away
---
yeah. had similar experience last night at my camp.
---
IT was using a tesla. my 520 bolstering DR lasted about a second. 
---
thought it odd and i am om XB?
---
My daily rewards were auto completed and got no score from those either!
---
Aren't we also able to right click on the pip-boy when we're looking at it to bring our arm closer so the menu and all the details get bigger?
---
Just like me
---
Meh I like my BOS Officer Uniform better cause it matches well with my scout armor.
---
Same here! I am still just a teen but I'm only allowed on my xbox once or twice a week, and I only get about 4 hours on my xbox per week, over the day or two. So I often end up making lists of things that i want to do before I come off. Now they're adding in more stuff that requires you to come on every day in order to keep up with the demands and I just cant do it. I'm kind of thankful that my xbox live ran out last week since I am able to restart fallout 4 and continue RDR2 without needing to worry about grinding on fallout 76
---
Building public team is the best, as it grants intelligence, this is the biggest xp boost out of all of the teams!
---
In the new trailer there is some kind of building going on outside Atlas, might have something to do with that?
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can dream 🤣
---
No cap!
---
For now no. But the season and atoms sales will be the judge for bethesda.
---
If it turns out free atoms were the push need for players to spend real money,while the season make sales drop, bethesda will revert immediatly to a system that awards atoms.
---
We are actually in charge here. If we don't buy any atoms till the end of the season,they'll have to aknowledge it.
---
No thanks.
---
The lack of an exterior console does seem to be a bit of a mistake in my opinion. I mean i under stand the vault wasn't ever meant to be entered after leaving it but how did everyone get in to start with?
---
Well you specifically said there’s no damage limit. But you DONT get loot if you just hit her a few times. So there must be a limit of which you have to hit to get loot.
---
Why am I being downvoted for stating a fact?
---
Had same issue last nite.
---
Exactly my thoughts. I enjoy the Events but being that I put hundreds of hours into FO3, FONV, and FO4, I will always be drawn to quests and storylines because that’s how I fell in love with FO. I’m not sure why every DLC has to be this massive extravaganza. Small DLCs and new allies are other side quests that lead to more daily’s seems like a no brainer to me. Take the Fauschnaut event for example. Why couldn’t they drop a dlc with a side quest that would need to be complete in order to get access to the hourly public event?
---
Touche
---
thanks
---
if it is capped then on very high int.
---
with 36int (double uny trick) it definitely gives more xp benefits than 25int, thats how far i tested it.
---
maybe its diminishing at a point idk but generally the nore int the more xp
---
Well said. I’ve gamed for years and if I ever bought a trash game(over the years it’s been quite a lot) I would swapping it the very next day. Yes it meant I lost out on money but that’s the way it went. Never once have I gone and complain about getting my money back on a game I didn’t like. And I definitely wouldn’t be still playing a game I had so many complaints about.
---
Aka fortnite. The challenges are available all season long, regardless of when you buy the pass as long as it's within that season
---
what stings the most is its a paid game! atoms and even f1st up to this point havent been so egrigious to me, but battlepasses are up there with lboxes imo. mb even worse since they have a rotation
---
You’re in a pretty small group, bud. And it takes the same amount of time to complete this stuff as it does to complete a single match.
---
Aye. It's been mentioned a few times. carnivore is doing the same for boosts as well.
---
Are you some kind of idiot? Read my previous posts. I said if you wanna comment about disliking the game then do but nobody fucking cares if you want to leave. So where have I demanded people not criticise the game. What an idiot you are really.
---
Im tempted to go Herbivore now, but if they "fix" this by removing the double effect (patch notes do not mention about it), then its hassle to redo all my mutations to get rid of it...
---
I'm not getting score either!
---
I’m not a heavy build buddy. I’m a rifle build. 
---
I don’t even have a lmg good enough or ammo for it. 
---
All I’m asking is that we all share the loot from the legendary bosses. 
---
It’s not really kind to just ignore everyone else at the event. 
---
Just now someone killed the sheepsquatch boss. And only 1 guy got to hit it out of 8 people.
---
This games community is definitely what makes the game fun for me as well. I’ve been crafting this crazy funhouse with my 2k hours of building experience and guide people through it daily. Hearing and seeing their reactions to what I’ve built always puts a smile on my face. And I get told often that random encounters like my camp are what they love about the game as well.
---
F*ck that entirely... I hate that I have to play this hot garbage game mode for even one challenge a day.
---
Me too. Although I only skip the ones from NW which probably will be the reason I don’t get anywhere near level 100.
---
No. That's the new BOS quest (the "pre-quest" to the new BOS storyline).
---
As far as we know, we will have to help rebuild and prepare Atlas observatory for when the BOS comes.
---
Yeah. The question would be if the feature is working now; or if this a a regression in their latest patch. 
---
I am not running that many mutations, but I don’t want to have the hassle you mention.
---
I agree. It's really disappointing. I logged in yesterday, and for the first time in awhile i just logged right back off because i don't want to grind dailies almost every day for 10 weeks. That just sounds shitty.. also canceled my 1st sub.. I didn't want to.. but, the fun isn't there as much anymore. I'll probably hop on from time to time, but I'm regrettably moving on from this being my daily driver.
---
destiny just released a new season and it took me 2 weeks to grind their season pass.
---
I was quite excited for a season pass in fallout 76 but I'm not even gonna bother if I need to play everyday for weeks to grind that out.
---
I haven’t missed any dailies and I’m at 11 so it sounds right. I’m at 1025/1275 for next level
---
They do, they are just wearing those black suit outfits to hide all the armor.
---
Yeh and especially when you start getting into mutations and certain perks, you’ll ONLY play in teams. Herd mentality and strange in numbers are godsends. Coupled with herbivore, you can also get 25% exp boost by eating cranberry relish!
---
there should not be a single one for nuclear winter, they could do seperate challenges for gamemodes easily
---
Can we get an itemized list of what's included in the Hunt's Brand Adventure Kits™ (Patent Pending)?
---
I still have my tricentenial one, but it has been renamed to "hello" for some reason!
---
There are many things that need to be improved with public events, because we cannot rely on everyone knowing what to do, unfortunately. 
---
Just an hour ago I logged in to a server to see Project Paradise pop up, the timer showing more than 5 minute have passed and  6 people were already there. Of course I went asap, expecting them to be at a good point. Well, all the habitats were empty, I started filling as much as I could and we ended up with 1 wolf and 2 bugs. One bug died immediatly, I shishkebabbed the other one until the end. We finished with 2 animals alive, bit as you said, that is not the point. There were more than enough players to get 3 max level animals, and it was not the case, because apparently people didn't know or didn't care to follow the objectives.
---
There is something inherently wrong with the events. And we all end up being penalized for it.
---
I think I have one Halloween thing left to get and two winter things. I’m fairly close... I’ll glad when I have them, game game mode sucks ass.
---
After patch 20 carnivores and herbivores get double the bonuses from their respective food items. No bonuses from the opposite food items though.
---
That it does it hurts my very genetic code to play it but I need that christmas tree if it’s the very last thing I do
---
was this in the patch notes? i swear i didnt see it in there, heh
---
lol thanks
---
i’m just glad this fight was one the SBQ wasn’t landing much, else i might have dropped my Unstoppable Monster
---
I'm not getting my daily rewards either, they were auto completed on the daily reset!
---
Im levelling up a toon and its ok when you are dealing with low ammo numbers, but on my other characters its a big stuff that. Its probably a sick vault-tec experiment.
---
Hi! I don’t need anything but my friend just started yesterday so maybe you could give them a care package
---
My daily auto completed too, no score rewards at all yesterday...
---
I'm a high school teenager and even i am a casual player. I dont have enough time to play and even if I did, my parents wouldn't let me. I'm allowed on my xbox once or twice a week for about 4-5 hours in total, usually less. I could never keep up with the fortnite trend when I played it so there's no chance of me keeping up on this one. I hate that they want players to log in every day in order to do a few challenges and then repeat everyday for 10 weeks.
---
I'm a the same point - just one weekly left and sat at Rank 11.
---
Untik the dailies refresh its effectively just xp grinding for the 10k repeatable challenge. Progress has slowed massively. Roll on refresh hour.
---
Found him in Vault 79 yesterday!
---
I didn’t see it either. Don’t know if it was intended or not. I’ll have to re-read them.
---
Here’s hopping we both finish getting our stuff from this POS game mode then buddy. 👍🏻 
---
I wish ya luck.
---
All that does is turn them into a grey outline, servers don't do anything about keeping them away form you! Even in Adventure mode!
---
I skipped them too. The season go's for 10 weeks and we are at 11 in the first 2 days. If we accomplish this much once a week we will reach 100. Hopefully there are only 1 NW daily challenges at a time.
---
I wish you luck I’m gonna try to get that slocum joes skin then I’m out
---

---
Pvp has been much safer and fair for me!
---
Oxhorn does lots of videos about all fallout games including 76. Also, I'm a teen (15, almost 16) and I havent got a lot of time on my hands. People think that teens have loads of free time but lots of us actually don't
---
Keep everyone on the grass if people stand on tents or V9, she won't land if they are targeted!
---
Seems about right.  I'm at level 12 and only missed the NW dailies.  I did spam a few more events than I needed to and also got some added XP from doing a West Tec run, but nothing crazy.
---
im nearly positive it wasnt in the original patch notes..they may have added it since then though..  its absolutely impossible for them to add all the changes they make. especially considering half the changes are unintentional, heh
---
Oh that’s a good tip! That fits my play style a lot more than the others. Thanks
---
Didn't mention a time frame. They hotfix after every broken update.
---
Also good to know. Thanks
---
Very nice of you. Hope the person sees it
---
The camera icon one? I lost that the other day but now it’s somehow returned...
---
I wish they would rework the gunplay. And a 60fps mode on OneX would be awesome too
---
I'd highly recommend Team Medic!
---
Everyone gets healed when anyone uses a Stimpax.
---
Rad Sponge is also a nice one, but I wouldn't ever use it in a public team where you might end up with a Bloodied player.
---
Yes but with her damage reduction, some people get 1 damage per hit.
---
I didn't mention atoms but that is something that does anger me, I'm one of those who will do absolutely everything to not spend a penny on a game ik ik but I don't have a problem with people spending there money on games hell I don't count birthday money as mine so I'll spend it in game. But what erks me is I enjoyed the grind for atoms I really did when they came out with the power armor of the Apocalypse? OMG yes I grinded everyday all day to get that juicy 1800 atoms PER armor but with this new system I'm not wanting to grind all 10 weeks straight just to get 1 power armor skin at 1400 because that's what your gonna get, we try to justify it by giving us "free stuff" but it's not the same. It's like when you get your first job and get your first paycheck and buy something with YOUR money it's just a feeling that's not the same as EVERYONE getting this if they grind b4 with the free atoms 6800 then nerf to 5500 and now 1500 buying from the shop with those atoms you knew not everyone will get this item and you'll get a truly unique or limited item. Sorry I know I'm bad at proper "Grammer"
---
It's an uncompleted game, it lacks content, it's got all the monetization it needs, and still gets more. Bugged items you pay money for, bugged enemies you can't kill, bugged end game boss. If they made even a slight attempt to fix some of the more annoying bugs, alongside microtransactions, there would be a silver lining. But they dont did that, fo1st hasnt seen an update since launch, they constantly make the regular grind harder ( 3* legendary drops nerfed). They have overpowered builds, and magic weapons that ruin balance, in a single player game not an issue, but this is an mmo.  They dont deserve money, until they fix an already broken game. Just because they polished it a bit since launch doesnt make it worth the price.
---
That’s really odd ! I haven’t Purchased that one but it’s gone :(
---
this
---
It wasn't patched at all!
---
Dirty suits no less.
---
For me it's ants. I can never see them in the fight, but they can see me.
---
I have it still. But I also own the tricentennial pack. Maybe that’s the issue. 
---
PS4 btw
---
I'm also at 11, still got some Weeklies to go. But been receiving tonnes of XP via Events and Team Bonuses!
---
No worries. I'm hoping it's not a hihh priority for them to fix so I can just get them doing the daily as I really can't be bothered grinding NW. Too much waiting around for me.
---
Yes, but it still feels underwhelming. Like, legendary perks and the wendigo boss were on the pts
---
Just checked steam and I don’t have Tricentennial, so I am very confused
---
I like it to melt my enemies with as a side arm
---
Knowing bugthesda they will patch it as quick as they can while the xp glitch will stay forever
---
This is not an airport no need to announce your departure. Just leave
---
I’m so glad you posted this. Not because I agree with you, but because of all the people mad that NW has a single challenge.
---
I’m not pretending everything is dandy there are still issues but I personally think the latest update has improved the game massively
---
We need to pay them a visit like i did the other day lol
---
That would be handy
---
Okay so that maybe is the problem. The other guy who mentioned he had this edition as well also still had the emote. 
---
Hope Beth sees this, as you mentioned, you paid money for it!
---
no I have that one , I'm missing the basic team-up emote
---
You play on Xbox one cause I’ll give you my old furious explosive 50 cal
---
Causes bethsda to get greedier, activation wasnt always the way it is now. Same with EA, the big 2 sludge balls, bethsda has made itself part of the sludge. Fo76 is an ABUSIVE relationship,  we love fallout so we play it. Bethsda knows this, so they put microtransactions down our throats, and wont stop because, we come back for more.
---
Now to get back to the grind for trivial items in real life.
---
Just re-read the patch notes and there’s nothing there on the carnivore/herbivore mutations.
---
To add a little balance just how many times have I seen high level players ignore count down clocks on events and start them immediately in a barely disguised grab for xp and legendary items. I've stood in Radiation Rumble allowing a couple of the 8 mins to pass allowing others to show up only too see PA Big Guns run straight past eager to grab their riches.
---
Doing things for your mental health is always a good choice. I wish you luck in your endeavours.
---
I don't like leeches either. The kick function raises the possibility for abuse though, as it does with other MMO group functions, but as you're the team leader I guess it's on you to make that call. 
---
For events like tea time, it's not exactly hard to solo, so on the one hand it *was* a bit mean. On the other hand I get not wanting to carry people as well, everyone should pull their weight.
---
It's not like he joined Encryptid, didn't grab a pylon, didn't help with the imposter or robots and just hid somewhere. That would be a kickable offense for me. It's a fairly hard event but contribute somehow, even if it's just reviving downed players.
---
i didnt think there was..  i know i went through it line by line when they posted them..  appreciate the confirmation though  :)
---
Im at rank 13 but I ran a lot of SBQ events while on a full events team so made a lot of bonus xp.
---
Is it every adrenaline rank that's broken?
---
I have noticed that certain ranks are broken while others work. I figured this out on rank 2 of 3 for lead belly. That rank is broken yet rank 3 works correctly. 
---
I know adrenaline was working for me a few days ago. Didn't pay attention since the patch. I had rank 2 going.
---
I only join em for the shared tagged loot.  Levels don't matter, do don't matter, just stuff to script and sell.  I'm not going into their janky UI and messing with my build at this point.  Hell half the time my mouse won't even go to the right 1/3 of the perk window.  (Seems just that and the map but out like that)
---
So sorry man, some of us just don't care to screw with our builds for some short term temporarily group.
---
The secret service chest is at least, one set of that in bolstering is tanky as fuck! Also the jetpack is amazing to zip around in, much better than power armor jetpacks!
---
Nothing is glitched in this perfected game my friend
---
Lol that's a good one. Of course I got a screenshot it was funny. She's in her bomber jacket and fasnacht beret
---
Yeah I see where you’re coming from. I think they are getting there. I fortunately haven’t seen to many bugs, like the fast travel one etc but I can imagine it’s annoying so I understand why people get pissy when they haven’t fixed this one along with a load others
---
Wait what? Public events are meant to give SCORE? That will make things much easier. Do you have a source?
---
I’m married to Karen
---
I mean, that's not untrue. except the game wasn't in a particularly good condition to begin with, it still isn't. so it's not exactly hard to improve on it. I could've fixed the robot and shadowed mod entries in five minutes, a year and a half ago. for reference.
---
and let's not forget the plethora of new issues patch 20 introduced. for no real reason. literally just because. it's like someone randomly edits entries in the CK with a blindfold on.
---
Bloodied gun users have better perks to equip! So it's nice to share for them!
---
Shit, that sucks. 
---
I’m kind of a Purist, no Rads. No Mutations just a girl her PA and a big ol gun (also perk cards) 
---
Though I’m hoping to find the one that slashes there defense by half so it would be 70 percent defense drop for Enemies.
---
So super random question, but do you know if the small water purifier be placed on the dirt foundations? I didn't want to spend the bullion just to find out they couldn't.
---
Could have sworn they patched that in the first year!
---
Awesome write up! Have an upvote!
---
Nope. The entire place is locked up.
---
Just FYI it seems like amount of score is steadily increasing as you move down the board so progress will slow a lot later on
---
PS4, thank you anyways! I’ve more than come to terms with it. I mostly play pure melee anyways
---
Doesn’t it only do that the first time?
---
look in your misc items
---
You have one of the things he "loses"
---
just shhhhhhh though.
---
I love it. Keep it up
---
I have 13800 .38, can I hand that to you and have you make it all into 45 for me?  200 rounds in I scrapped that pos and threw it all back on my vendor.
---
I'd rather not sell it on my vendor then go through that horrid menu and .. who knows literal days later maybe be done converting.  The ratio is too shit ontop of that.
---
Considering what it could, should have been... This incarnation is an insult.
---
They were tested in the public test server on PC, feedback wasn’t great so they were pulled from test server and being reworked.
---
Yeah, seems like you can put anything on them. I can put my Turbo-Fert on top/amongst the Crops too. Didn't think that would work but it did!
---
With junkies, psycho, bloody mess and all 3 HG perks maxed gets me up to 233 on ballistic and energy. 
---
Bloodied will be much, much higher with nerd rage, adrenal reaction and the bloodied bonus + psycho.
---
Yeah it happens all the time.
---
Rad rumble is shocking 
---
I love it but no one seems to go get the ore and it usually fails.
---
I got the rad barrel plan previously but everything is so unorganized. 
---
A few people guarding the scavengers and the rest collecting the ore.
---
Same with encrypted.
---
It's so easy just grab the pylons but I usually have to grab all 3 as no one else bothers.
---
No one seems to know how to do these events successfully and it's so easy to do.
---
nice
---
Yes, it's the best jetpack, it doesn't cost fusion cores, you are much lighter than you are in power armor so you can fly further if you're smart about it. It's loads of fun just going over lakes instead of swimming through them, going up cliffs easily, and launching myself from my camp halfway across the map!
---
The problem is the fact that the required amount for a level keeps increasing. There might be a time when we might need multiple days for one level.
---
scrip the lot and get a nocturnal lead pipe.
---
best weapon in game.
---
my constant problem with the workarounds so far is that the UI is absolutely inconsistent in behavior so everything ends up going off the rails. going back and forth with tab often bugs out and takes me right back to the useless splash screen. mashing enter works until it decides to throw me into an unrelated ammo menu and i either stop dead or start converting the wrong ammo.
---
i've now accidentally scrapped a few hundred rounds of 5mm that i've spent ten minutes creating beforehand because the menus seem to have a life of their own. i've run into similar issues when trying to spend the tokens, too. handy tool for camps, but yikes it's an astonishing UI failure.
---
I was going to make a thread about it, but you got it first so, I'll say my piece: Fo76 is now officially the grindiest mmo/action/rpg ever. And by that I mean that it has surpassed the likes of PoE, WoW and even MHW. The only difference is that the grind in the games I mentioned is fun... especially MHW - hunting the same monster tens of times? yeah, but the monster is awesome and the fights are awesome so I don't mind. At all.
---
Why? If anything PVP should be removed totally from adventure mode.  All it's done is cause issues/griefing.  They need to bring survival back and make that PVP only to keep em separate.
---
Why do people need to broadcast things that are like Easter eggs.
---
Imagine what they were like at school, always snitching to teacher!
---
on C)
---
After level 100 I gained roughly 0.8 level per day that I play on work days, since for a single level you need 15880 experience, that means I get around 127 SCORE exp from repeatable per work day.
---
If we add new Teams bonuses, specifically Builder we get 4 int which is 8% about more experience, which makes it 137 SCORE experience per work day, on weekends we can multiply that by 2,5 times on average, so we have 137*5+342,5*2=1370 additional SCORE per week on average, that's 13700 SCORE for a season if it's 10 weeks long for how I play.
---
Oh i don't know
---
SHHHHHHHHH!
---
It'll be less than 1 if you have the bear arms perk!
---
It's the Karens!
---
Doesn't it confuse your friends? 😊
---
Best find :)))
---
gary
---
I'm not sure someone meant to leave all that, but good for you then anyway. Don't use a trash can to move things to your dupe.
---
Awesome! Guess I know what I'm buying next. Thanks for the info!
---
I agree. I only have time to play 2 to 3 times a week, and only for about 2 hours at a time. At the current rate I don't see any way possible for me to make it through all 100 levels.
---
yah I scrapped mine toot sweet.
---
and it doesn't even make plasma cores.
---
That weapon seriously needs to be nerfed.. I can 3 hit kill any radroach in the game, yes even the glowing lvl fives...
---
We spoiled them by fixing the bugs ourselves back then! Now they're entitled into thinking it'll go away if they ignore them!
---
SHHHHHH!
---
I'm missing my daily score as it auto completed on daily reset...
---
the problem with the fixer is that it's already a skin for the regular combat rifle. and I don't trust Bethesda not to change this without making all legendary fixers non-legendary. it's happened in the past because apparently skins take up a legendary slot? something to that effect.
---
Don’t listen to this guy. I was the one that actually dropped my nocturnal rolling pin.
---
They didn't fix god mode, or ward, or over encumbered while dead glitch!
---
Oh true...I did not consider that.
---
Did they ever acknowledge that they broke adrenaline?
---
Everything stacks in God mode, infinite unyielding, infinite xp boosting items, everything! So they just make a load of rugs and scrap them for over 8k xp each,
---
As a fellow player who got fucked over on pre-order, I've been playing since beta and I cannot agree more. The game has barely changed since then, yea there are npcs now but they really didn't do much of anything to fix the core problems of this game. It feels like they just slap a band-aid on every few weeks, while they cannot wait to drop support.  It feels like they are doing the absolute bare minimum just praying for the day BGS pulls the plug so they can drop it like the hot mess it is.
---
ssssshhhh
---
Beyond comprehension. Kevin doesn’t like it
---
The terminal system is terrible. The ugliest one I have is when doing nuke silos- there is a terminal to deactivate turrets that is hooked up to like two dozen. It takes A.G.E.S. to load up the menu to deactivate them and then when it's done it hangs there. I'm never sure if it actually 'went through' or if I'll end up getting seen by lasers and slaughtered by an assaultron. Oh yeah, and the whole time you are dickering around on the terminal you are taking crazy radiation, to boot.
---
A possible workaround for the workaround for you would be to stash other ammo when you are doing big batches. Super convenient, right? :-(
---
Take an upvote for community mindedness. Nice man.
---
We don't talk about this feature.
---
I have to hope these accounts get banned, it robs the community of the sense of achievement from the season when a few bad eggs are exploiting to complete it all.
---
more like rear feature...
---
Hehe, I ended up making a brand new heavy weapon/PA character, just because VATS and guass rifle didn’t work. Guess this new char is my main now 😁
---
Never scrip bloodied, even 1 star bloodied is amazing!
---
Finished what?
---
The entire run? 
---
Hahahahahaha
---
There is litterally no way that happened
---
Don't let fomo ruin your life. Enjoy what you do have , quit trying to get it all.
---
Ive completed "seasons" in other games with that amount of time and i dont see why bethesda couldn't of made it like that but im just some guy on the internet.
---
Radium rifle is good... If you can get any mods for it...
---
This is one of the reasons I moved out of whitesprings. Sometimes while logging in, my defense turrets would shoot the robots which in turn start destroying my turrets (luckily i still stay neutral). 
---
I wonder if it's similar to the bug where workshop turrets attacked each other (this was fixed)
---
2 days and I made it to level 11 S.C.O.R.E.  while working 13 hour shifts.  It really doesn't seem that grindy, at least for people that are high level.  Am I missing something?  Is it going to become a lot more difficult to rank up?  Seems like it would only take a month.  Which is pretty great considering it's going to be about 5 years before I unlock the Guass shotgun.
---
This. Ive been making excuses for them since beta. Nothing has truly changed.
---
Got Knight paint for the T60 about 10 days ago but nothing since.
---
i wont! wich is why i will get rid of it lool
---
The stats are worth it. Cosmetically it clips through everything I have on top and look horrible.
---
Shoddy devs again I'm afraid, never test anything.
---
It's just more common after this patch, half of the enemies I fought in a queen fight just fully healed yesterday! They were also still hostile!
---
Adrenaline is broken. It's very important to me, won't play until they fix it. Have they got as far as acknowledging that it's broken yet?
---
Then just say I dont enjoy 76 and quit not I'm quiting cause I can't have it all
---
Should delete this post. You're lucky. Will save you so much time.
---
AFAIK it is possible to use kb+m on a PS4 or Xbox. But I have no idea does the game support this method of input or not.
---
Of course :) im online right now
---
It'd be nice if they actually paid out the score promised... My daily was auto completed, so couldn't get score!
---
I wonder how it stacks with the new lunchboxes too.
---
Same, 2 hours of Public events while closely monitoring score points and not a single point given
---
i enjoy 76 very much! it is basically what i always tried to mod f4 to be. this is why i ask the qestion here bc if it isnt s,th that will push me away ill stay~
---
I think she is at work right now but if you give me your PSN I will give it to her and she can add you if that works? Then you guys can work out when is best to meet
---
Yeah, it’s become painfully obvious that I will not be able to complete the season. I just don’t have enough time to grind. I have a job, and I can’t/don’t want to spend every waking moment otherwise playing this game. Also, there ARE other games out there that I would like to play. I’m a huge Fallout fan, but it’s never going to be the ONLY game I play. They’re making it very hard for casuals to get invested, and the prospect of making any real progress is daunting.
---
Overseer xp is different per character!
---
Fashion *is* the true endgame in any online game afterall.
---
It’s a very well known bug idk why people are acting like you just gave away the newest dupe technique
---
Just found that out too. Wish there was a quicker way to convert the ammo though.
---
stacks on stacks..  i had the 25% from lunchbox and the 25 from the relish..  the public group buff, an int food buff, rested buff..  so much xp!  heh
---
Ok it is Peaching4Life
---
This isn't an open mic night, no need to voice your opinion.
---
Yeah I have loads of hiding spots I use in Morgan Town,, and if you use your camp intelligently you can reach some high spots!
---
Thank you!
---
ABABABABABABABA
---
That's what I thought as well from seeing some online vids with intelligence perks  shown and xp gained on mole miners. 
---
I use PA so it's hard to boost over 30 but if it does then it's worth it  to grind lol. At this stage xp is very large for me so every bit helps 😁👍
---
Same here at 11. Did the NW challenge too as well and I kinda felt bad because I never do pvps at all so obviously I did terrible but still was able to accomplish it. I wanted to tell my NW teammates that I’m only there for the daily challenges 😂
---
I think the ski sword is in desperate need of a skin
---
&gt; Except for the SBQ there is no dmg limit to get the loot.
---
English is not your first language, I take it?
---
What I wrote means that there is only the SBQ having a limit at which point you will get loot, all other mobs only need to be hit once (tagged).
---
Yes, they should change everything just to accommodate you.
---
I have no idea
---
It does appear to be some form of internet baby talk.
---
Butvon the other hand we can't say if the level rises the whole time or only to a specific amount, or if it drops back to 1000 once we reached the next part.
---
No standing ontop of anything causes problems, as she is targeting that person! Personally I keep my survival tent further back!
---
But there still was a chance it could have been damaged due to some screws being loose or something just happened to be that the universe fo76 is is in one where the door is undamaged
---
If you haven't already you should definitely do beckett's storyline, it drops a pretty damn neat heavy,  a 3* AAFFR 50 caliber mg
---
No it is not. 
---
Okay I see now. Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience
---
Just a question...Is this a fast start and slow progression thing?  What I mean is I just got to play last night since this was released.  I played for about 4 hours and got 10 levels.
---
This seems pretty easy to get to 100 so far.
---
Well given the time period and...ah fuck it, why not.
---
They've not worked since beta for me....
---
It takes three points of Charisma to share each rank of a perk card with your team. So the typical Lone Wanderer build with 4 Charisma can share a rank one perk card but not a rank two perk card. If you want to share a perk card ranked up to level 5, you need 15 points of Charisma. By simply scrolling over an equipped perk card that's shareable, the game will display the button press you need to make in order to share it.
---
My real concern is the trend that theyre showing with endgame decisions, they keep restricting/capping most endgame currency/items and how you obtain them. Bottlecap cap, gold cap along with treasury note transfer cap, and now the casual players in the endgame can't grind The Legendary Run efficiently to succeed. Just like the bullion grind for casuals. Just like the bottlecap cap. They're going the wrong way with endgame grinding.
---
Didn’t even think about this but I’m definitely going to start kicking the dead weight. There’s always other people that are down to help. Thanks!
---
The lunchboxes stack too. Had three people open them at SBQ last night for +75%
---
You need to relog to fix that, because by changing them out, they think you are a visitor not the landlord!
---
It's actually a much bigger deal to me that adrenaline is broken. Has anyone seen that they've acknowledged that it is broken yet. I know they won't /can't fix it until they know.
---
You complain about something you have to do once in your entire life?
---
oh woooow, i did not realize that..  i wonder what the max stack is for them then..  or if there even is one..  :-O
---
It increases by 25 score each level so yes.
---
Yes, they promised a lot more but I am good with what I got and will happily pay to renew in a few months.  The scrapper and the tent are game changers for me since I can park my tent in the Cranberry Bog and not have to walk my overweight ass to the train station after every event.  Yes I am a hoarder.  The scrapper is great, I have so much saved I will never have to worry about having enough materials to repair my guns and armor or when I build something new.  I do appreciate your effort to remind BGS that they promised more but in the end I support capitalism.
---
Aye go to The Pitt and see what's going on overthere
---
No harm done and certainly no need to be sorry .)
---
English is also not my first.
---
Everybody loves weight reduction, especially when it comes for free. GG.
---
Because people program bots to auto down vote people en mass!
---
But muh 3 less people to kill me!  It's totally my right!  I'm a selfish ass who wants to grief others for cosmetics
---
/s
---
Nice post and i'm doing it the same way , but to be honest it's a workaround to a problem that should have never existed in the first place =/
---
You will never miss if you don't shoot
---
But will he matter when starfield is released?
---
This game has so soured me on Bethesda that, where I used to be a day one purchaser, I now am not even sure I want to buy their games anymore.
---
I noticed all the enemies in scorched earth just regenerated all their health so many times last night!
---
It's crazy isn't it?  As if 99.9% of this game isnt geared towards them already.  But Todd forbid nuclear winter gets one damn challenge hahaha.  Everyone loses their minds.
---
well most people get the info from dodgy click bait youtubers
---
I'm calling BS. Only way you're 3 hit killing a radroach is if you're using the cheat menu you access by pressing alt and f4 together on pc.
---
I'm Brian and so is my wife
---
Yeah in every mode, they seem to be client side only!
---
It’s tedious, but at least it’s there.  Though I wasn’t paying attention and started converting the wrong ammo after a while.
---
I had to server hop so many times to get this quest done!
---
I felt this way a few weeks ago and for me, with COVID, I am bored as hell. I took a break, I took an 3 weeks off, played other games I enjoyed, and I'm back for season 1. 
---
I 100% agree it's turned into a chore, but I've realized that you can stack treasury notes from events, and you don't have to log in everyday. The new teams idea is great in my opinion because you can meet new players, get bonus's for the game, and really the challenges are easy. If your at a point where you feel trapped, take a break, there's more to life then this game.
---
Yeah, it is tedious. But I am glad I have it.
---
No problem! Get the Turbo-Fert too, so handy!
---
I want my baseball bat to be a giant dildo
---
I hope we get eggs too, otherwise its just a worse brahmin!
---
have an upvote for the LOL
---
Not a bug, working as intended
---
Workshop was claimed by someone, you were violating the law, pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.
---
Your stolen goods are now forfeit.
---
I'm upset as I'm missing out on score too, the daily just auto completes!
---
I have no issue completing the outlaw pass in RDR2. It shouldn't be geared towards daily players.
---
Just scrap the crop and replace it.
---
I see the moaning didn't just stay on those posts. Lol. 
---
I agree. With you for most of what you said. 
---
I get frustrated for sure, with some of the glitches/bugs. 
---
In fact some of them glitches and bugs can make it fun. 
---
But, I still come back and play it. Because I like playing it!
---
If I didn't, I'd uninstall the game..... 
---
I dont think its a widely know thing on here. Maybe I should put up a HELP post. 
---
On "how to uninstall fo76". Hehe.
---
And there are less legendary drops!
---
I agree! 
---
I enjoy the game enough to want my experience to be the least shitty that it can be. So workarounds it is, lol.
---
A grinding motivator that incentivizes atom/cash payments.
---
Some people are saying next week the xp weekly will change to a repeatable public event weekly. 
---
I agree we need some clarity
---
Adrenaline is broken, I can't /won't play until it is fixed. Have you seen if they've acknowledged that it's broken yet. I'm totally down with ignoring their challenges, and making my own fun. But I don't want to play with gimpy broken versions of my characters.
---
I'm pretty sure he said that the workshop wasn't claimed at the time. 
---
Which means "It just works.TM".
---
Upvotes for visibility and hoping you find the guy or gal.
---
Ah, that's cool, the whole reason I didn't log out and back in was because I didn't feel like reclaiming and rebuilding.
---
https://youtu.be/UUnOYA-jFrI
---
I found that only those events that give treasury notes will up the score.
---
i mean, they arent out in the field so why would they wear their heavy cumbersome armor when doing paperwork...
---
How nice of you 👍
---
I've been working on a caster build as it's a weird weapon. Despite being heavy it works way better with vats so not great with PA. Aside from legendary effects getting it to work well effectively gimps you from using most other things I've found.
---
There doesnt seem to be an answer for this but I really hope so since I've been dying to play on PC because the game looks like ass on my base xbox one but its where all my progress and atomic shop items are
---
Exactly, I don't know who's at bethesda saying "I got it, how about we make it a DAILY grind again even though literally no one who actually plays the game wants it!". I just don't get what they're thinking.
---
"But servers are expensive to run."
---
That's pretty much the response you'd get to your accurate criticisms of the monetization in this game. It's sad that people are doormats.
---
I've spammed those for the last 2 days and only had my SCORE go up from the repeatable after getting enough XP from the events themselves.  
---
Would be interesting to find out if it's a bug that is keeping people from getting it, while others are.
---
Sorry, like I said the workshop was NOT claimed, I checked after the notification.
---
It never used to be that way. I dont know if theyve changed something or if theres been some weirdness with the drop. Ive read about others who say they were getting them out of order
---
phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range for the pew pew pew guns
---
I've noticed this as well.  Quite often I'm the only one sharing a perk.
---
This update is great and the challenges for the most part are pretty damn ez. The rewards In my opinion the rewards are pretty great. Now I feel that there was some badmouthing about the update and people who have never played the game are going off that just for karma. Like the people who watched "The Fall Of 76" and then just decided oh this game sucks without really trying it.
---
Take a Mentats, a broiled scorchbeast brain, and some brain fungus soup, you'll notice an immediate difference in xp gains!
---
That’s the nature of MMOs unfortunately. Various events that have time limits - such as the fabled weapons back in Everquest, various holiday events in World of Warcraft, to even more modern games like the Season pass in Dead by Daylight.  Shoot, there’s a ton of events that basically punish people for starting games later or not being available, even pokemon has limited time events for capturing the newest Overside Pokémon’s or when they had the stupid scratch cards you had to get from GameStop for the mythics to add to your collection.
---
This is why, as a general rule, I prefer 100% offline, single player games that I can play at my own pace. FO76 and Dead By Daylight are my only two exceptions anymore, and even now I’m torn between finishing the season pass for DBD or working on the season pass for FO76 (
---
You gota sit on the compy and block people
---
When I move my cards around, I forget to share something
---
It's really annoying because it would take a community manager all of a few minutes to ask someone on the dev team for us exactly what is going on and relay that information to us.
---
i do not want any more model swap skins. they need to add actual new weapons in the game.
---
that would be awesome, although more chance of plaiting snot.
---
Haha love it.. the old hide porn hub when you hear keys in door trick! Surely that one only works on Minecraft noobs lol
---
Thats the joke, its not working as intended.
---
But if the works shop was claimed, then the person leaves the server, sometimes things like turrets and extractors persist after, so even though its not "claimed" on the map, it sort of is still claimed and youd have to claim it to get free reign of the area.
---
I haven't messed around at workshops in nearly 100 levels so things might have changed.
---
i wouldn't even mind the ghillies if they were in batches of 2 or 3 and recieved earlier on in the roadmap. Then i'd have a reason to keep going, as most of my characters already have a suit of armor that works best for them, so ghillie wood armor really doesn't interest me.
---
its in the files now lol
---
I get that I'm an extreme case and not the normal.  But meh..
---
Defeaning silence, that's the answer. 
---
They will literally only come out and say something when the pressure is big enough, see the Fasnacht Event.
---
The power of habit and of familiarity?
---
not the spy outfit, the green/brown uniform from FO3.
---
its in the files but has not been released
---
This is not an open mic night no need to announce your opinion. Just shut your cake hole
---
They were literally on an operation when found.
---
I would like to play with my CHA character, but I don't want to grind the factions again and do the awful scout things to get the backpack.
---
I've been switching it to Events, complete the Event, Switch back to Build. Sorted. Gotta maximise any, and all, XP boosts! HeHe.
---
Adrenaline is broken. That is a much bigger deal to me than the stupid season I was going to ignore anyway. Has anyone seen if Bethesda has acknowledged that they broke it yet.
---
I was in one tonight that closed on Grafton dam... I got stuck in the water without aquaboy 😥
---
Why's the disaster with the screaming eagle skin?
---
i run 3cha on all mine so i can use hard bargain or strangerinnumbers/tenderizer/teammedic and share an lvl 1 perk card.
---
i once cancelled my fallout 1 s't two weeks later i was back, this game is cursed 😂
---
Right where I'm at. Probably be next week when grinders start pulling away from the pack. When the date hits to buy levels with atoms all best are off. But whatever, not my money. Just wish there was more gold or rep increases.
---
Also the weekly challenges are largely what contributed to you leveling up so many times and those won’t refresh for another week.
---
&gt; This is not an open mic night no need to announce your opinion. Just shut your cake hole
---
I think most people forget, not that most people can share anything that great, since they typically don’t have more than 4 CHA for lone wanderer, maybe they go up to 6 and can share a 2\* 
---
I honest to goodness would love to sit down with a couple of people and all of us build our characters together as a team (sorta in a D&amp;D way) and plan things out as a group.  Maybe it’d be a different way to play.
---
I understand where you're coming from.
---
maybe if they just first  took a moment to fix everything they've added, and then add stuff again, that'd be infinitely better than "hey look at this...uh... clean sink! it produces purified water. only 12 dollars and your left kidney!"
---
Didn’t you also get a 2* armor reward, improved repair kits, stable flux and a prime plan?
---
Sorry, I'm bad at sarcasm.
---
Except that for most MMOs I've played, if I want to take 6 months grinding out some faction rep via occasional dailies I can. If it's a seasonal goal, then they accommodate weekend warriors who can't play every day of the week, or have a catch up mechanic that gives you bonus progress until you reach a certain threshold.
---
For FO76, they put a very narrow cutoff time on top of the daily system that doesn't have any flexibility. Then they implemented a catch-up mechanic that involves spending up to $1.50 per rank. Which is kind of a slap in the face for someone who works hard and does every single daily to complete the season. They won't even be the first to gain the rewards because someone with $120 can finish the board without even playing the game 2 weeks after the season starts.
---
What's the confetti?
---
And these lunch idea y'all speak of
---
I play on a XB1X and it's like a slide show 90% of the time. Constant jitters in menus etc. It is nearly unplayable it's so frustrating. I can't see it being a hardware issue solely.
---
Happened to me last night. At last I'm not the only one and hopefully this will get addressed.
---
Haha it did dawn on me that I may of slipped into that realm after I posted it 😅
---
No worries, Beth has the WV map pretty screwed up location-wise, so who knows..  That neck of the woods should put you near Richmond, which using game scale should be another run across the map to DC, or about 20 minutes, lol.
---
I dont think very many people know about sharing perks. Its not really explained well and a surprising number of players dont bother looking/noticing buttons etc. I only knew about it when someone else told me a while ago. I think as Public Teams gain popularity and get used more, people will start to share cards more. the concept is still in its infancy for a lot of players who would normally solo
---
I was about to post the same question, lol. Did it to me at least a couple of times yesterday. (I'm on PC though)
---
Yes i got 2* armor. The one with environmental. But i didnt know about the repair kits. Thanks bud for informing
---
No one probably dropped it. Sometimes when an enemy dies they dont turn into a lootable meat pile but just drop the lootable items on the ground. So someone probably got some hits on a legendary mr gutsy and amid all the other dead robots lost where it died and the legendary weapon spawned on the ground.
---
I'd pay atoms for craftable fireworks.
---
Its still working for me but I’m on Xbox didn’t notice your ps4 tag earlier
---
no they arent, they are holed up in one part of the vault, cut off from the rest of the facility because their reactor is fubar and there is a big ghoul party. its not an operation, its just the shit hitting the fan.
---
I would say many people, me including, just forget to share Perks. I played my 300 levels almost alone and never had to share a perk. But after seeing a few posts like this I try my best to remember sharing Perks haha!
---
Its when you have a bunch of weight reduction perks. 
---
It's not a particularly good build but its adequate 
---
You won't be killing stuff fast, but you'll be able to carry a lot of stuff you probably won't need
---
I'm on PS4
---
I have been running lone wanderer for so long with 3 charisma that I honestly forgot it was a thing.
---
This is what I came here for today. Has anyone seen if they've even acknowledged that they broke it yet?
---
moving the cursor to the bottom middle of the screen is helpful.  if the cursor is to the left or right of the terminal, then sometimes whatever terminal entry thats on the same line as the cursor will be highlighted.
---
using W and S to navigate the terminal and E to confirm is my preferred method.
---
and finally, ESC to fully close the terminal.
---
It better, really slowing my progression down
---
I've had a lot of fun following some random stranger who just invited me to thier team and then just... go back and forth and mess around. So i geuss the community is the part that makes the game tolerable.
---
No. They were on an operation to secure the Vault. They haven't been locked in their for 26 years.
---
Is it always the same flux or is it random
---
Ok tbh your build isnt bad but its your wepon the lever action is widely considered to be the best rifle in the game damage wise the only advice that i can give you is convert to a V.A.T.S CRITICAL stealth character the criticals in vats are godly i can sometimes do up to 1000 if im lucky but mostly 500 criticals
---
That’s a good question. I never noticed. You get a few different ones.
---
Yeah It does seem unlikley that would occur, I just find it strange we get slips for gold bullion yet we can get and scrap items for GOLD and that can't be converted into slips lol
---
Frankly I'm just disappointed in how lackluster the cosmetics have been.  It would have been so easy to just bomb us with hair, tatts and cloths... but they've barely put out any hair and tatts... the ones they do look look like crap... and the clothing has just been MEH all around.   This is in comparison to Elder Scrolls Online, which it's obvious they are trying to mimic with subscription model, which has fan fucking tastic cosmetics that I have to constantly resist the urge to throw money at... 
---
They wouldn't need all these Repair Kit, Ammo Converter, Cooler Pay-To-Not-Grind bullshit if they just got some folks on staff who knew how to make stuff pretty...  I get it's the appocolypse... but no one wants to /pay/ to look dirty and gross...
---
Yup, can even track the progress of it in "challenges".
---
There is a grind and then there is this grind.
---
I’m not averse to working for it as I maxed out both RDR2 passes and was able to do so at a pace that didn’t feel like a massive undertaking.
---
Bethesda seemingly want me to to put all other games and entertainment away and focus purely on FO76 for the next 10 weeks.
---
Check Atlas. .  .
---
I run a two charisma character, he can't share anything.
---
Exactly.  I dunno how much time I'll get to invest in completing daily and weekly challenges, but hopefully I can overtake him.
---
best place is the rusty pick :D  
---
i usually dont go farming for legendaries, i just exp and do challenges or simply roam around. while doing this, the best rolls i got (which still are bad :D) were from whitespring ghouls, pretty mainstream.
---
If you play Xbox and come across “MEAT SLINGUR” then I’m not sharing because I have 1 charisma. I don’t play well with others. And if we team up then I’ll probably try to bring you to my camp so I can attempt to fling you off a cliff with a springboard trap.
---
Carnivore is probably better as you still have an xp option with squirrel stew but all those tasty scorchbeasts. There's no herb equal to those.
---
Ty Bro we look
---
pretty much, not seen campfire tales though.
---
Atom store is all they are interested in and FO1st
---
NW is abandoned.
---
Im on PS4 so no mods for me sadly. Id like something like that for legendaries. Im tired of losing them.
---
As someone who can't exactly play for super long periods of time doing the queen has been my way of getting flux
---
What platform?
---
Ps4
---
Ive been pointing this for a long time ago in tweet and foruns for them.
---
Sony has a bounty  whoever find bugs. This is evolution, this is what looks like a smart company should be doing in the near future to keep their products sharp and clean.
---
Who best than thieves can find loopholes in your system? Their brain works diferently than righteous ppl.
---
Plus you are redeeming someone from the "dark side" to do some.good.
---
This is my opinion thou.
---
Ugh I wish I could help but I'm on xbox
---
Is the only way to get SS armour handing over the gold during the raider vault raid? Fuck, there’s so much of this game I don’t know.
---
that is a great idea. still cant imagine that the grind is so tight, you need to do everything everyday. this might be a great way, lets hope beth plans something like that.
---
The most important perk to me is broken now. Fix adrenaline.
---
pro tip: if you prefer playing on a private server, you can still make a public team on a private server and get the bonus for one person. this also counts you as "on a team" when completing events, which will count them towards the "do events while in a group" daily/weekly quests
---
I’m running into this bug now. Sol refuses to move away from his chair no matter how many times I reload. Anyone figure out a fix? I’m trying to clear other quests to see if one is interfering.
---
Hop servers.
---
Personally never used VATs in FO76, makes no sense and always less accurate than manually shooting.
---
I rarely teamed up before so I simply forgot this was even a thing that existed.
---
It's funny since you can make razorgrain flour but not bread
---
yes they have been. did you not read any of the terminals? they have been there since the day the bombs fell. its a vault ffs
---
they are the secret service, its their job to guard the treasury (the whole reason they exist)
---
why would they leave the US gold reserve unguarded for 20+ years and then all the sudden decide to "secure" the vault? that makes no sense at all.
---
they have been there so long that one of them had a fuckin kid dude, why would you bring a kid on an OP? you wouldn't.
---
Do you do vids? Sounds cool.
---
Thanks, added that to the list. i have a few now I can pick from depending on what I think will be useful at the time
---
lol do you really assume they have a clear concept? They don't know either
---
It'd stop everyone bitching and moaning about grind
---
I’m hoping that we get a double score weekend, and I hope that some of the other upcoming events (especially anything for Meat Week) give out some good SCORE too
---
I doubt it, the mechanic is designed to keep people engaged i.e. keep playing so any ‘shortcuts’ would not be conducive to that - why bother grinding xp for 2 or 3 hours every day when I can wait for a weekend or event and get that same xp in half a day? I can see a monetised version coming though as per the Fortnite model especially with diminished earning of Atoms from daily/weekly challenges, which would effectively lock the best items behind a paywall. I think we’re all test dummies for this season to generate and gauge interest and this is being viewed as the future of funding the game. The problem now is FO76 has effectively started competing not just for peoples interest but for people’s time and there are more engaging, rewarding games and other activities to spend that time on - there will always only be 24 hours in a day.
---
Try to favorite items like radaway?
---
Troubleshooter is a very situational effect, most people that have weapons with it use it to clear nuke silos
---
On my 1st character I always ended up sharing  [Magnetic Personality](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Magnetic_Personality)  as no one seemed to have enout Charisma to share anything decent. I had 9 Cha so with that I could share a 5 point card in a team of 4.
---
Also sharing that prompted people to share cards more often I found.
---
Once upon a time I was the rare 9 CHR character that could share the 3 star perks.  As the game progressed I ended up winnowing that down to 6 because frankly I rarely teamed up as I was only doing dailies and charisma just didn't do much before.
---
I do like how Wastelanders made charisma a lot more relevant.  Lord knows I go through a LOT of grape mentats nowadays!
---
The best communities I have seen are Fallout 76's and Halo's
---
It's random which types you get.  Same with repair kits, randomly get either 2 or 3.
---
Regs doesn't discriminate, he'll take gold from anyone who wants plans, wether or not they were smart enough to keep it all to themselves after the raid.
---
No. You can purchase the plans to craft the armor from Regs for gold bullion once you’ve completed the quest line. You can earn 200 gold bullion a day plus an extra 300 from Smiley every week.
---
Or, an even better alternative, go to the ammo factory workshop
---
If it's a decent weapon keep it and enjoy it, or get a decent amount of caps for it.
---
I've found him once in a Mothman Cult camp. I want to say it was Southeast on the map. Can confirm he was extremely vengeful.
---
That's a lot of damage * whacks water tank with flex tape *
---
I have been collecting the Final Word, and will gladly give you one. I think have 6 now. I also have a troubleshooters 50 cal thats my go to, and i would be hurting if it went missing
---
Ah, I never noticed it was repeatable. Thanks!
---
Or pick up the ArmCo from the Raiders and just have that build ammo for you.
---
consider changing to commando, the higher fire rate adds a lot of damage.   
---
picklocks are QOL (quality of life) perks, equip them only when using. i use concentrated fire there. if you dont use vats, long shot could be an option.  
---
when using CSA and stealth, you should focus on not getting hit. therefor, white knight is quite useless. add some damage adding perks like gun fu or adrenaline.  
---
same goes for serendipity. are you a bloody build? if not, get rid of it.  
---
my build is pretty the same, CSA as only armor. here are my perks:  
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f454fb&amp;d=pp2lt2ep0ic2p02l12a04l71lu2ii0cr0s01pg2ph2pi2eh2ar2an2ao0a72ce0c62&amp;w=cu2if2pa0p80p90c52iq2at1ij2i30ia0i50ik0lm2&amp;m=c95180f3&amp;wp=w6w1&amp;wm=1k2437-1l2138&amp;n=Donald  
---
far from perfect but it fits my playstyle. i down everything i come across and die only from stupidity.
---
I never farmed Atoms either. I mean I probably should've since there were a lot of items I would've liked to have gotten but oh well. However, the season has not only made me start doing weekly's and daily's but it's also caused me to move outside my comfort zone and start playing with strangers and communicating with them (which is a really difficult thing for me to do due to anxiety about my voice). I'm honestly grateful for the season. It's made me enjoy the game just a little bit more....even if the converter sucks lol
---
what is your goal? a full health build or a low health build?
---
i reccomend in any case
---
strenght: keep as is or add 1 point and go for blocker lvl3
---
per: remove lockpicks add lvl1 concentrated fire and add glowsight/insecthunter or put 2 points somewhere else
---
end: swap for fireproof lvl2, add 1 point for radicool if you go low health
---
cha: tenderizer (lvl1 is enough for extra dmg), if in team stranger in numbers
---
int: nerdrage if you go low health, poweruser if powerarmor, other than that meh
---
agi: remove white knight, add peng-fu and adrenaline (broken since patch, but hopefully fixed soon)
---
luck: remove cando, good with salt, class freak, add grim reapers sprint, ricochet and critical savvy
---
Ah yes, I need atoms. I could care less about perk cards but they are nice too
---
Its like hearing the thump, thump, thump while fighting the SBQ and seeing your health quickly go to zero and its all because of a Mirelurk Hatchling.  WTF!
---
They have been moved to a later update due to much needed revisions.
---
No
---
ahhh, ok, thank you
---
I normally do, but I already had my wheel filled with other stuff (like Fury and Psychobuff) since I normally do melee.  It was impromptu for me to even do the SBQ fight, I was busy doing something else when I saw that the bomb was dropping, and scurried to get my stuff together.  
---
And most times it’s not a big deal, this one particular time was just very laggy for whatever reason, trying to even pull ammo out of stuff was a pain.
---
I have 4 CHA, so the only thing I can share is the traveling agent. But I share it...
---
Each level takes more and more score points. You won't make that same kind of progress at higher levels.
---
Before the update I noticed the tool tip says only 60% on a max level backpack. In practice I noticed my food spoiling at the same rate as max level good with salt perk. It feels like the wiki is right but the tool tip is wrong.
---
Although to be fair I haven't actually used that character with that backpack mod since the update. Always a chance something might have changed though.
---
It's not much, but I love it. I empty it at the start of each play session and then just leave it alone to refill.
---
They just added new weapons to the mode. It’s not abandoned lol
---
I don’t really do building tip videos, that’s best to see a live demonstration of so questions can be asked and people can practice themselves. If you’re on PS4 you’re welcomed to add me and check out a tutorial session. Same psn as my username on here. 
---
I do make videos, but not consistently. And I usually prefer making music video style videos of my camps [like this one](https://youtu.be/3adUzwI8Mv0).
---
Once you select what type to sell for points and it moves you to the next screen you just hit back to go to the previous to sell again.
---
Never played Halo, so I don't know the community... what is it like?
---
The most toxic communities are Rainbow Six and CS:GO.
---
The patriotic salute, as far as I’m aware, was only to be available in the tricentennial pack. A bug recently gave it to everyone and they fixed said bug so it removed it from everyone who didn’t actually purchase it.
---
Dude you’re dead on with the final point, as a level 468 with about 2,000 hours invested, I find leveling up every single day to be pretty impossible. I don’t play NW ever (never have, never will) so I’m out 750 score every other day (not including the NW Sscore). There needs to be alternative challenges or something. 
---
And the lack of story, quests or any real meat to the game is becoming a glaring problem.
---
If you've never played NW, you can get today's NW challenge by just loading up NW next time you need to take a dump. By the time you get back, you'll have gotten more than enough exp to gain a level, thus completing today's challenge.
---
I have 3 CHR and I cant sagre anything better than rank 1 of Tank Killer
---
Seems you are new to Bethesda and FO76 right? Take a seat
---

---
Wondering if it’s a vampires LMG? Don’t think it has any other good perks along with it but I dropped one yesterday on purpose if that’s the gun on PS4. Either way if it’s not it’s a very nice thing you’re doing dude just in case someone has lost there best weapon. Love this community
---
Yeah, I was actually planning on using for silo runs (coupled with my Troubleshooters/Sentinels armor), but well... 
---
It was just sad I accidentally dropped it.
---
Something for the flamer that removes the brackets, it just looks clunkier than it probably needs to be
---
Now do this everyday for 10 weeks.
---
forgot to talk about CHA: if you lack damage, tenderizer is a great skill here. with the new public teams system, lone Wanderer lost its purpose to me that why i changed to team related perks
---
I've seen paper bags drop lately when killing human NPCs as well.
---
Bargain!
---
Was the text red?
---
If you on Xbox and plan on clearing a silo soon I can give you a hand
---
Cheaters cheat and we are supposed to take that as the baseline?
---
Sure 
---
Must be too easy
---
Or use melee
---
Oh I'm not looking for full completion on it, but I'm definitely having fun with what's there.
---
I think frog legs is great. I can see those people hopping from a mile away. Easy to snipe them. 
---
If you really think you are at a disadvantage without it... why don’t you equip the card? If you don’t have the card... why don’t you spend some of your overseer cards and get the card?
---
Mmos usually have time gating. But not like this. They have the sense to reward constant grind. Fallout 76 puts gating on every single grindable facet, and it doesnt even make sense. 
---
Timers all over the place and dailies and daily gold bullion severely limited. Having a limit on scrip is fine but the daily one makes no sense. They force you to log in daily or you miss out. Most games have the courtesy to at least make the limits weekly instead of daily,  so you get a chance to catch up in the weekend when you're busy the rest of the week. 
---
Then theres the god awful trade system. How can it be like this in 2020? Diablo 2 came out 20 years ago and had a simple working trade window. Player A puts item in a window. B puts his in. They both lock in and agree then trade. Instead they have a cap limit of 30k that forces you to spread it across several characters. 
---
Oh yeah speaking of, if you want to transfer items and have no friends, either pay for a private server (that sometimes crashes anyway and you lose the items you're trying to transfer) or leave your items in a public server and hope some random accepts your invite, because you cant rejoin without it. All other MMOs have a transfer system. I mean I'm trying HARD to love this game but Bethesda cant stop cockblocking themselves
---
&gt;him and his brother was some of the hackiest cornball highschool level drive
---
*"It hurts!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh"*
---
&gt;Please pay no attention to the character model standing ram-rod straight and not moving anything but his mouth.
---
I have  4000.38 rounds because I really want tons of 5mm and 50. and now i am going to have to use a broken system for so many rounds.
---
Future content (maybe)
---
Since I play solo for 99% of the time I only have 3C Points so I can run with Lone Wanderer equipped
---
What would you want the other 3 people on the team to be sharing with you that is worth checking for?  
---
What would I bother sharing that anyone else would benefit from?  
---
Do you need to recheck every time someone next joins the group?  
---
What on earth are you doing in groups where min-maxing with a single extra perk card will make a measurable difference?
---
When I first started playing, I had planned on playing a medic in teams (well before we knew everything else in the game).  I had this character at 15 CHA with all sorts of perks that would heal the team.  
---
I also came to the same conclusion, I rarely ever group.  I didn’t drop his CHA too low. It still is sitting at 12 and I plan on keeping it there, some day I’ll actually get into a stable group of adults who want to play like once a week to go off and do exploring, maybe even role play it out or something.
---
Meanwhile I play my Solo semi-bloodied Unarmed build
---
Is it Bass? Like 2-3 seconds of the same riff randomly?
---
Good attitude. I could not get into this state of mind, but I'll be back when the One Appalachia is released.
---
I still don't see where this is explained.  However, I figured out it means that it's the actual challenges for each day, not individual events or dailies on the map.
---
Bush camping can be fun when done right
---
From what i have seen in recent posts, lots of things that were supposed to be fixed weren't and many more have broken since the patch. 
---
I'm generally pretty calm when speaking about games but god damn, why is this game the way it is. 
---
This is the reason i absolutely despise the way people defend this company and its practices in regards to monetization and the quality they offer. It's like you're buying super expensive shit.
---
Does it really seem that awful to people that i want a better experience for the game that i play and enjoy? People are acting like this is an indie, 3 person team that struggles with their game that is free to play and cosmetics only cash shop. Like god damn...
---
NW is explicitly designed to not be a fair BR.
---
I am happy with everything for the most part except last night as I walk up to the SBQ corpse to get my loot and for a moment I see Bloodied... then the I see I lost the server.  For Tods sake why!!!!!????
---
It happens whenever you get a text or event notification in the top left corner after playing NW. Try restarting the game after playing NW.
---
This. I love that I can literally cross almost any terrain with ease simply by jumping. Those mutations with a jet pack on a mobility build is absolutely awesome.
---
LOL this game.
---
I am on XB and cannot complete Sophia's questline. Been like that for months now. So she's just there in my camp till i scarp her console. again. Bethesda support says to restart console, log out and back in etc. The obvious shit everyone tries...that is their solution :)
---
It was definitely exciting. One of those “Oh sh*t oh sh*t oh sh*t-“ moments ha ha ha
---
Very generous!! If I wasn't working for the next 8 hours I'd take it haha
---
They’ve added a bunch of new ones like “kill arthropods” and “kill animals” etc which are fairly easy
---
Correct, it's poorly worded so the confusion is understandable. It took me while to realise as well.
---
I feel the exact same way. Life and work are both things that I would hope most people, adults at least, hold as a higher priority than cosmetics in a video game. As a completionist, of course I would like to get to 100. But I will not put life on hold to get cosmetics that I'm very unlikely to even use. I would understand the hate if this was a paid battle pass type situation. But it is both FREE and OPTIONAL. Plus I'm sure you've all more than likely already unlocked the actual utility items this season. Everything else is essentially just to flex.
---
Or just dont use it? Ammo isnt a problem
---
This is how people are supposed to approach it. A lot of people are of the “all or nothing” mentality though. They can’t accept the fact that they may not be able to get every single cosmetic. I wonder if these people buy everything in the atomic shop also or if they are ok with some things getting away
---
Canned meat stew is the same
---
Does that work to increase the amount of charisma others have available to share cards with? I would've assumed the sharing was determined by the hard SPECIAL value, and Magnetic Personality would be treated as a buff and not increase your charisma for sharing.
---
I’ve been sitting at 4/5 For Complete a Daily Challenge and I’ve completed three more Dailies with it never clicking over to 5/5.
---
They’ve been stringing us along.
---
I assumed they’d start releasing 4 stars after the first year or with wastelanders.
---
Hopefully it’ll be future content
---
It’s literally to fill their daily log-in quota to report to share-holders.
---
[I’ve had a few of those moments myself ](https://youtu.be/-Td1gP3wHOE)
---
Out of all of this ghillie shite they added... there was no ghillie handmade skin to go with my future ghillie scout armor and ghillie backpack. I’m very disappointed.
---
Saw valseek respond to an early complaint, but no word on any fix that I have seen.
---
I find it strange in comparison to the Destiny "battle pass."  That one speeds up as you rank it up, where as this one slows down. I'm a third of the way through the season and just playing casually I'm halfway done, whereas with fallout I feel like I'm going to be forced to play every single day. This is truly a baffling choice. The new rewards are cool but without any new events or real content to do while earning them, this feels a bit shallow. It's definitely a good addition to the game, but unless everyone doing the math on this score system is wrong, something needs to get a bit easier here.
---
Firebreathers or fireman outfit?
---
In order to form a habit/get familiar you have to spend time doing something. Their argument is that the game has always been awful, not that it was great and then became awful over time.
---
I’ve got 13k.38 lmao
---
Hmm. Lack of gear stopping me. Finding a good lever action is a challenge.
---
The halo community is very friendly to anyone, it doesn't if you're a casual or a die-hard fan of the series, everyone is there to have fun, sure there are the occasional toxic player but they are everywhere
---
And yeah those are some of the most toxic community, I don't how the league of legends community is on the outside but here in Brazil they are very much toxic
---
In that case they better make new legendary effects or its going to be too op: 
---
Bloodied, Two Shot, Exsplosive, Faster Fire Rate Handmade
---
A fool and his caps are soon parted..
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong - you’re actually right on the money but don’t realise it - but this IS what they want, it’s how the live service model generally works. Inconvenience the player as much as possible by creating frustration through artificial, unnecessary barriers to - with the ultimate aim of locking you into the product so you spend more money. It’s how drug dealers work. Eventually people get so pissed off they either quit or buy that subscription and/or Atomic Shop item but again that loss of players is factored in - a high proportion of revenue from these types of games comes from a disproportionately small number of its players. They’re not bothered if you leave or are pissed off at the grind, and they’ll only be bothered if they do something that triggers the big spenders to quit (and they’re not the ones who have all those nice things from grinding, they just bought them).
---
Whew, thought I was going to go a whole week without a FO1 sucks and is a lie post.
---
I think you can skip one daily because honestly the repeatable is completely easy to complete multiple times a day which more than makes up for the measly 250 you get for the NW challenge. Sorry but it was a nice change for there to be a reward for those of us that do like nw. I’m sorry you hate it but not every one does and we deserve rewards too. Just do the weekly repeatable a few times to make up the score points.. it’s really not hard to do with regular gameplay.. I did it like 5 times because I was in a group with my friends yesterday and all we did was just normally running of events and we caught the Queen when someone launched etc. it’s not as hard as everyone is making it out to be
---
Responder Firefighter i gotta change that
---
I don’t disagree with anything you have said, though I have played games that have had Worse time gating than this, though many of those are more of the old style MMO RPGs.  Everquest and Everquest 2 are probably a couple of the worse ones I can remember.  
---
You could only raid a boss once a week at tops, then you had to hope it dropped the item you needed for your quest, and then it would only drop one, and then you had to be the lucky one in the guild that got it.
---
Then add that on top of all the other grinding.  It took me I think about 9 months to finally finish my “epic weapon”  which became outdated a couple of months later when the expansion came out.
---
Very interesting. May I ask what guns you are using?
---
When i join nw, i bush camp with 4 people because the game is a joke anyway
---
I feel like they're trying to provide live service updates to this game like an MMO and they clearly do not have the manpower to do so.
---
They implemented the monetization part first without the content to back it up and satisfy paying customers for the timelines they require to add and implement new content, so they're relying on pure RNG and ridiculously long (and shallow) grinds and time gates to buy themselves time.
---
I don't think they're going to be able to catch up without creating a LOT of disappointment and animosity from the player base that they need to be the cornerstone of their financial support.
---
They're stuck and it sucks. They need the money NOW to provide what should've been in place at launch, and they're failing to recognize that this daily login requirement isn't going to work long term for adult gamers such as myself who actually *have* the money to spend each month that they need.
---
I wouldn't mind these grinds as much if I could complete it on a weekly basis rather than a daily one without falling so far behind, but for some reason they keep adding more and more daily duties without catch-up mechanics that aren't blatant "pay us" schemes in nature.
---
I know for a fact that I'm not going to be able to complete this season without paying for atoms to complete the last 30 or so levels and that is very disenchanting. Who wants to start something they know they can't finish without paying to complete? It's simply not fun. I don't even feel like I have a chance.
---
This is a full price game with a subscription, an ingme shop, a battle pass, and time wasting grind mechanics. This is as cancerous as any cashgrab mobile scam.
---
The game is fun even in its buggy unfinished state, but im sick of people defending the live service bullshit that somehow gets a pass in this hobby.
---
The challenges have been awarding score early before completion. Perhaps you got the reward before actual completion and didn’t notice. 
---
Look at your rank and do the math to verify if you’re missing any score. 
---
There have been numerous posts about this issue.
---
That was actually bloody amazing lol
---
There will be new, these god already data mined a half year ago.
---
Yea its gonna be challenging but worth the grind
---
Thanks! As for the end goal that depends on what gear I can find. I think thats whats holding me back atm.
---
Still, it's not said that the amount of challenges, nor the amount of score rewarded for said challenges stays the same. Every math work on this only speculates on the 2 days it's active, which might not be representative. There could be weeks or days where you earn double or triple the amount of score.
---
broken adrenaline fucking sucks..
---
Carnivore is better then herbivore. Glowing meat steak increases melee damage whild canned meat stew has a exp boost
---
I am both disgusted and enthralled for some reason.
---
If only trade wasnt its own language...
---
I think these kinda items are banned from being sold by the subreddit.
---
Is it laziness though? I feel like incompetence plays a role in here somewhere. The quality of this game in all aspects doesn't match the price tag and all the micro/macro transactions and subscriptions they so blatantly offer.
---
But maybe that's just me. More expensive sadly doesn't equal quality for this game.
---
That’s a rare outfit that only drops from forest events
---
Exactly, if you play a lot its just going to ping 2-3 times even if you just do dailies at higher levels.
---
They should just copy ammo vendor machine / scout vendor design and let us sell unwanted ammo for "ammo points" and but needed ammo right away. It's just that simple but they desided to make this stupid barely usable terminal thing and fucked up... as usual.
---
Great comment, take my upvote :)
---
The one that pairs with the white helmet?  Now I'm confused.
---
I’m glad to have the ammo converter, as tedious as the interface is.  
---
personally i would love to see an overhaul of a lot of the UIs, in particular the crafting ones - holy hell just let me craft 30 glowing meat steaks at once.
---
That’s further than I’ve been able to get, and yet they told me to do that initially even though I laid out where I was.
---
I think so, I got awarded something I assumed was the repeatable when I was 3/5
---
Really??? I had that and threw it out because I didnt know it was rare
---
I just wish we could set it to max ammo conversion rather than a clip at a time
---
Wastelanders is the best thing to happen to FO76 since launch, I'm loving the Public Teams.  
---
Yes FO76 is grindy, but so are a lot of games, such is life.
---
Nah its the internet everyone gets an opinion
---
Gotta give their 1 dev a break it's hard to code by yourself
---
Haha. There are a lot of ways to have fun in the mode even if you don’t usually like battle royales. I like to build 1x1 buildings with no doors and play a theremin inside. Gotta do what you gotta do. Glad you enjoyed.
---
I am too. No idea why their names are so similar
---
Counting down the months here with my son until Cyberpunk lol. It's ironic because on one hand having Cyberpunk be delayed yet again is like "ugh not again I can't stand the wait" but on the other hand I'm praising them as much as possible for taking all the time in the world to make the game the way it should be so I can replay it countless times for years to come just like the old single player Elder Scrolls and Fallouts. It's amazing what not rushing can do for a franchise. *Thinks back to how many times I've reinstalled both Skyrim and Fallout New Vegas*
---
The only "5-star" you can get (though shows as 3), would be a 3-star Fixer with a Prime Receiver:
---
 * Legendary Effect 1
---
 * Legendary Effect 2
---
 * Legendary Effect 3
---
 * Faster Movement Speed while Sneaking. Harder to detect while Sneaking
---
 * Bonus Damage to Scorched and Scorchbeasts
---
Think you mean Breach &amp; Clear.
---
all containers including priority ones were empty for me last night
---
I haven't played since launch (thinking of giving it another go) &amp; it used to allow me to share higher level perks so I don't see why it wouldn't allow others.
---
It used to Pre-wastelanders
---
I'll take it! If you don't mind a buddy of mine meeting you
---
The guy literally says they're about to run out of food after arriving 6 months ago.
---
I cant even get fixer plans and people are getting these :/
---
Ah I’ve never tried setting down my camp in NW... Always too worried it would move my camp in adventure mode or the stuff off my displays would disappear.
---
It also lacks a 'sell to max' option which would make the exchange of small value quantities far less time consuming and depressing.
---
I use it simply to make use of the otherwise almost useless MiniNukes, 40mm and other trash that gets rewarded in the (...) line of event awards.
---
It's clunky I'll admit that. And yes, getting out of the damn thing was rough. But I usually do small ammo drops as gifts at my camp when I stash my stuff after a run. So it's not much different. Now if I had 2000 .38 rounds, yes converting that would be a PIA. But the number of rounds per convert is terrible AND the ROI is atrocious. But it's not the best UI I've ever seen.
---
That's odd, my rolling pin seems to heal them rather then damage...
---
I don't even really care all too much about a lot of the "rewards" - I mostly just like the false progression and visibility of it along with the Public Teams aspect making it a sort of "accomplishing a task together"
---
Wait, what?!
---
Reponders FireFighter outfit? As in the blue/white one?
---
That thing has like a 0.5% drop chance from Forrest events and "Thirst things First". If this is suddenly all over the place on the cheap, something is seriously wrong.
---
And... I need to find one quickly &gt;.&gt;
---
AWOL armaments. Done it about 10 times now and had at LEAST 1 3\* enemy every event. Best was 3. 
---
Got a Bloodied explosive faster reload lever action from it the first time. Godly weapon. I'm not bloodied though.
---
ALSO! If you do the horde events. Do NOT kill the boss. New enemies will then spawn and they'll be higher level. As long as you don't kill the boss to end the event you can farm away. legendaries to spawn in the waves but it's also good for mats and stuff
---
It’s tricky. You’ll have to pay attention to how much score is being awarded when you get the pop up. The repeatable is only 100 score. Most of the challenges are 250 I believe? 
---
On a side note. The repeatable can be done about 10 times an hour if you really grind XP in the right areas allowing you to achieve around 1000 score an hour. 
---
I was grinding XP for a few hours last night just to build up rank because I know there will be days I won’t be playing to give me some cushion.
---
Somebody came by my camp a second ago and dropped of a VTU baseball cap and a traveling leather coat (both rare items)... I haven’t seen that amount of kindness in a while.
---
the crux of the game is' farm resources for ammo, make ammo, throw ammo at various stuff, have a chance at something when you do', repeat process.
---
that's it. 
---
make your own fun between all that.
---
That one would be for carnivore right?  And it’s only normally a 5% buff..  so 10% now with the mutation..
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Responder\_fireman\_uniform](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Responder_fireman_uniform) 
---
This one is the rare one and is worth a lot.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fire\_Breather\_uniform](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Breather_uniform) 
---
This one is not rare and is basically worthless
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fireman\_uniform](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fireman_uniform) 
---
This one was from the halloween event.  Not sure on the value since it didn't seem too rare of a drop to me and I assume it will be coming back.  I wouldn't pay much for it at all if anything.
---
Yes fine. First come first served
---
r/unexpectedoffice
---
Thats good, I've got access to Cranberry and Meat Stews so West Tek is looking mighty viable lol
---
Wait you tested it in pvp?
---
I would hope that at least some of these items would make a return later on in the atomic shop. Otherwise it's true that forcing people to grind who normally just enjoy building or roleplaying is going to be a detriment to their gameplay. They didn't realize how popular CAMPS were going to be at first and yet now they're one of their main money makers with atom spending.
---
I bought my Plans for 15k; and have since gotten two of my own (I trigger the Encryptid Event at least twice per place session)
---
I got one from Thirst Things First I think, I threw it out because I thought everyone had one :((
---
Pretty much although not too random. Seems to be to when you interact with some things or get an alert about something like an event. It's a known bug but, at over a year ago from the posts I was reading, I had assumed there would be a fix.
---
I just completed the kill 5 different types of robots and wasn't awarded any score points, maybe its the server there have only been 2 events up in the past 30 minutes... they need to take a month and focus on nothing but fixing broken things ffs.
---
i play 4-5 hours a day during the week and sometimes up to 30 on weekends. i dont even want to do all this bullshit.
---
Responder firefighter is a different outfit than firebreather. The former is rare. The latter is a common outfit everyone gets in the main quest.
---
I have been out and in and it is persisting. I could try a full hard restart I guess.
---
You mean script lmao
---
I've only just somewhat recently (past month or so) been experiencing it myself.
---
I get that now. I had the rare one and got rid of it
---
They must all be back to grind on the internal QA server, doing all that indepth testing bethesda is reknown for.
---
You can complete that repeatable in just about one run through WestTek
---
The Purveyer. I've never gotten anything decent from the game world AI.
---
Oh I know lol if I can figure out how many levels I'd need to do per day or per week until the end I can work out what to do
---
Don't waste your time on him, guys a fucking tool, most likely couldn't even kill a player fresh out of the vault lol
---
Crow_Kain, hes aware and waiting! Thanks!!
---
I'm trying to stay positive; I'm using this opportunity to try a pistol build with those 5 free Agility slots.
---
OP I'll hook you up with a Fixer Plan if you still need
---
nuke his base with a 2minute warning lmao, pointless..
---
I just find that people that have to brag about their skills, usually aren't all that.
---
Im on XB1 :(
---
Yeah, there is the Responders Paramedic jumper, Reponders Police Uniform + Cap, and the Firebreathers modified firefighter coat + helmet. Those are quest rewards.
---
The Responders Figherfighter uniform is "*please, just kill me now and end it*" rare. If they are all over the place, absolutely go grab one for yourself so you have it again.
---
If you just hold B or Circle it'll leave the terminal.
---
I rather like the convertor despite how slow it is. Don't get me wrong though I'd love a bulk option.
---
Totally different camp and you don’t need materials to build. It’s safe. I have a whole bunch of blueprinted structures I plop down.
---
Damn my bad
---
Its fine. I forgot to change my flair
---
&gt;What would I bother sharing that anyone else would benefit from? 
---
I mean, I always ask if anyone wants me to share bandolier . . . . it tends to help out a lot for some of my friends. (Who are, admittedly, lower level than my main by a significant amount)
---
&gt; Adrenaline
---
broken
---
just craft it
---
Interesting... I’ll have to give this a go then, thanks for the info.
---
At least you're living up to your username.
---
It was a bug that has since been fixed where adventure mode awarded packs. I would hold onto them until the next NW event since you can get xp from opening duplicates.
---
Lore-wise they are trying to get all the hold back into the vault, so they only sell stuff to you and don’t give out gold.
---
A lot of items in the atom shop are there for a "limited time"
---
but many of those "limited time" items reappeared in the shop several months later.
---
  At this point, no one knows if items that can be earned via seasons leveling will reappear in future seasons, (eventually) appear in the atom shop, become awards from other events, etc.
---
  If you enjoy playing, then play.  Seems silly to not play because you may (or may not) be able to obtain (some item) \_right now\_
---
  Besides, camp size/the number of things you can display/build at your camp is limited; you will eventually reach a point where you cannot display every single item you are capable of crafting.
---
Adventure mode leveling if I'm not mistaken. When I wanted the ghillie suit I popped on NW and had a ton of packs to open and I only run one character.
---
I have found that some people go into these events hoping others will do the work, or with the intent to just kill spawns and not even try. It can be depressing.
---
My friend is constantly haunted by the mothman.  Nearly every time he plays the mothman seems to find him, often more then once a session.
---
Good luck out there.
---
I’m and Xbox play also. I never repair the SAM because the explosions tend to cause a lot of frame rate issues. It a much better time without those explosions happening, too bad everyone repairs it anyway (unless you’re on a private world of course). Besides the SAM does bugger all damage and doesn’t help out much anyway
---
The Responders Fireman Outfit and helmet are extremely valuable to collectors. Roughly 60-80K worth. I had just the outfit and got a bloodied 25 25 laser rifle and 2 other weapons plus 100 of each stable flux for it.
---
Someone got me as a kid playing Diablo 2 with that lol.. Said if I dropped my windforce and hit alt f4 It would dupe. Lmao, good times.
---
I’m not worried about being able to complete all ranks. I’ll get there for sure by the end of the next two months.
---
The only perk I remember being actually relevant was Rad Sponge, but I imagine that messes up a lot of Bloodied builds now.
---
I dunno.  It's sort of fun trying to figure out what would be most helpful to people.  Generally I share Field Surgeon - not too many folks want to waste the points but it's beneficial to full health builds.
---
also glad to know that I'll need to take screen shots before and after completing them as proof in case more don't award it.
---
I wanna die. Please kill me with the lase rifle.
---
Could they be using the EXP glich (like when they jump to level 1000 real fast) to get the repeatable EXP challenge over and over?
---
Here's hoping, I'm too much of a completionist to not get rank 100 lol 
---
Hopefully they wont make it so its impossible to reach rank 100 without spending
---
You know whats funny I have one of those in my inventory waiting for script reset.
---
Or like any pass system I have ever played or heard about, because most devs recognize that players have lives and wont be willing to set a schedule around doing some busywork in a game every day, because that isn't fun.
---
What are the exact steps you took before this happened?  I'd like to "troubleshoot" this myself.
---
Double score?
---
Because of score we arn't even going to be getting a double xp weekend until next season
---
If I miss a few days, does this mean I can't continue on with the legendary run?
---
It’s a good idea but they didn’t know to put in game. It’s really annoying to use in game.
---
Are you charging it up? It doesnt do full damage without charging it up anymore
---
On ps4 it's the "O" button to back out of screens on a terminal . At one point I didn't know this and someone told me, and it's been saving my ass from bots in the silo ever since while I'm in a terminal. They said instead of hitting the back button "O" 3 times or whatever it was to just hold it down and you'll back all the way outta the terminal. So I'm hoping that a few ppl see this and don't know as well, and it make their life a tiny bit better. Not sure if it works on XBOX
---
Lol wow and here I was thinking id have to earn my perks on my 2nd toon😂 thanx for the info yall appreciate it
---
Mudflation.
---
I've been switching between Build and Events. Gotta maximise those XP boosts!
---
500 atoms per month isn't enough for anything worthwhile considering most of the good stuff comes in bundles. It really pushes people back towards the Fallout 1st subscriptions which I'm sure they have seen a down tick in recently considering the posts about it, which is COMPLETELY the wrong way to go about things for Bethesda. You don't see people flocking away from Fallout 1st because of problems with it and decide "Meh, let's not fix it.. How about we just take away their atoms so they have to buy them now instead." That along with the ammo converter and legendary perks show that the people in charge of this game are sadly not capable of properly maintaining/building upon this game (or even that many are not gamers themselves which is a bad sign.) I truly wonder what sort of amazing things this game could have done if Zenimax had the reigns with all the hard work they have put into resuscitating the game and making into something special. There are so many events and a regular schedule of updates that people know they can look forward to something new instead of crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.
---
You can continue but if you miss a few days you might not be able to finish it completely.
---
It's not perfect, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. I bought it at launch, have taken a few months of breaks, and still have 600+ hours in it. You get your money's worth.
---
No crossplay.
---
It literally says where you get s.c.o.r.e. on patch notes:
---
"You will begin “The Legendary Run” at Rank 1, and you can advance your position on the board by earning S.C.O.R.E. through your Daily and Weekly Challenges. These include completing Public Events and leveling up your character."
---
Meaning, no you won't get s.c.o.r.e. from events/public events etc. Unless they are part of challenges (like "complete 3 events").
---
Figures
---
Why not both?
---
If you are on Xbox can I have your stuff? :)
---
If you down to do the event, I think I still can do it for free. I never used it from quest. HMU if you want to do it, hopefully we can get more people to join.
---
I poke at mine anytime I'm back at my camp.
---
A bullet's a bullet and one more is one less I need to craft.
---
It is absolutely because of duping, but it also ends up just hurting the legit players more.
---
To be honest, I have been running solo for so long I just forget to share them.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Funnily enough Encrypted finally popped this morning and had about half the online folks turn up to it.
---
Bingo.
---
Or just use all of'em; take the workshop, setup an ArmCo, and chuck whatever bullets you got taking the workshop into the converter.
---
You got rewarded at 3/5 most likely. Known bug and Bethesda is aware.
---
Oh yea, my bad. I always forget other people may not have 3 lockpicking
---
Huh, yet No Man's Sky is able to keep going without all the mirco-transactions.
---
There's a difference between a "daily" Challenge and a "daily" event. For the Legendary Run it is referring to Challenges to get 5/5
---
6 months of being stuck, cut off from the rest of the vault, where the rest of the supplies/armory/other facilities are. how do you not get that? how are you going to make a kid in 6 months dude.
---
you can literally find notes and terminals written by the agents detailing their experiences living in the vault. and a terminal outside the vault door saying that the vault was sealed the day the bombs fell.
---
Spammy actions like cooking multiples of a recipe already tends to be a laggy, slow process. Not enthused about the long-awaited ammo converter having a similar system.
---
820 hours in and I still find new things to do. It’s a good time to start playing. Wastelanders was a great addition. If your friends play on PS4 I would recommend that. It’s fun with friends but also enjoyable to play solo
---
Wait what, I launched a nuke yesterday and the Queen didn't spawn but the Colossus did. Could that have just been a bug?
---
Sadly im off rn ill be back in 40 or so minutes so youll probably be done but thanks for the offer
---
Yeah, you need to put a small charge on items, otherwise some greedy jackass will clean you out. I had free ammo for newbies for a while, but it rarely went to them, and unfortunately 1 cap per bullet is too expensive when you're first starting out.
---
I have experienced this about once a week for the last month or so. On PC, the only solution I’ve found is to hit the power switch. Most annoying.
---
That would depend on the build. I will be missing all those canned dog foods I have available.
---
I could use  
---
Cranberry Relish (+10% bonus XP +200 AP) &gt; should become +20% bonus XP + 400AP)  
---
Corn Soup (AP Regen +3%) &gt; should become +5%  
---
Blight Soup (Crit DMG 20%) &gt; should become 40%
---
Tato Juice (Max AP +10) &gt; should become Max AP +20
---
\+ in case of certain fights
---
Hard Lemonade (+30 max AP +10% AP regen)
---
Ballistic Bock (Improves ballistic weapon damage by 15% but increases the condition cost by 15% for 5 minutes.)
---
This is how I feel I’m an adult, I work long hours, the system would work fine if they gave a little more time to complete the season say an extra week or two. With that said the game needs to be worked on I’ve been endgame for a long time and struggle to find a reason to play anymore and the season would have been great but the only things I’m interested in are at the very end and if I’m not going to make it then what’s the point.
---
You don't need to play an instrument to get the Wendigo - the jukebox is more than enough.
---
And it wasn't even a big expansion.  I think the story was shorter (and much lamer) than the Mistress of Mystery quest line.  I was intentionally pacing myself and I finished it in I think 10 days of pretty casual play.    
---
The biggest additions in wastelanders were all the new locations, but a good percentage of them were either used once in the quest line, then locked away, or are just random wilderness npc faction strongholds that don't do anything but look nice.    
---
The NPC's everyone was raving about add pretty much zilch to the game once that quest line is over.
---
For real public teams and lunchboxes can make xp a snap
---
Where are you two from, Nose City?
---
Just to add on, after seeing someone mention similar yesterday, and finally getting the Ammo Converter myself, I tried it out on PS4, and it works much the same there, too (and presumably the same holds for XB1) - to repeat any transaction, instead of going through the entire menu system again, just hit O / B to go back to the previous screen. It'll still update your points and ammo totals correctly, and *should* keep your previous selection highlighted, too... though I'd recommend not mashing buttons *too* fast, just to be safe.
---
Plus, #3 there is a good tip, too. I dumped in enough ammo to get the max 2000 points, bought enough .45 and .50 ammo for my Lever Action and Hunting rifles to get back up to the amounts I like to carry, converted some more to max out the points again, then shoved all the spare ammo back into my stash for another day. Honestly, I didn't find it anywhere near as bad as the complaining on here had lead me to expect. (Though it could be *better*, of course, and I could see it being a bit rougher if I tried to carry thousands of rounds of ammo, rather than just a couple hundred each...)
---
I don't know how the system would work but not being able to loot the imposter is also frustrating. I ended up becoming a conduit but before I could even hit the squatch a random pub team showed up to the event and killed the sheepsquatch so fast that no one could loot it except for that team.
---
Event Groups and SBQ and Encryptid definitely help.
---
I just spam X on PS4 till the ammo is gone, or I’ve hit the 2k limit. Only takes a few minutes. Don’t get me wrong though, I absolutely hate this thing !
---
They probably are poop players then gj :)
---
Yeah i got to lvl 9 with all my packs.  I really wish I never opened any of them because I could of used them for these stupid NW challenges they are making me do.
---
 Hindsight is 20/20.
---
The Final Word is indeed a damn good gun that replaced my Vampire's 50 cal. Back it up with a FuriousFR gauss minigun which I only bring out for stuff like the SBQ or should an emergency "oh shit!" situation arrive.
---
pro tip: Alt+F4 is the Boss key
---
Free ammo, chems, and sometimes legendaries with the jukebox going in the back compaired to hearing the same tune on a loop for 5+ minutes straight and getting squat. Im guna go with ghoul farming everytime
---
I was concerned cause my camp is down by the Nuka cola factory so I usually take the ammo factory to have map coverage so if I don’t have that I’m doomed 😂
---
Absolutely - the only downside to Encryptid is that you can only do one per server, then you have to jump &amp; re-team...whereas you can do three Queens in a row.
---
For me, the Grand Slam is 3 Queens, Riding Shotgun &amp; then Encryptid. 
---
Then you jump servers and do it again.
---
It’s definitely a fun system, I enjoy the feeling of being rewarded for just gaining XP, but I’m still very bitter this shite replaced our daily and weekly atoms.
---
that must have been one hell of an epic battle. i have yet to encounter a Colossus
---
everytime the SBQ pops up i always run around trying to find that Wendigo on steroids, but alas no luck yet, just a couple Squatches. 
---
nice shot, i would have loved to have been there
---
This works for all terminals btw.
---
Save them!!
---
My bad
---
Read patchnotes.
---
Ok so I really dont understand then I mean yes it could definitely be improved but I do t think it's bad enough that I have to scroll through 5 thousand post about how bad it is just to see anything else on this sub
---
You can do it while jumping, or if they have a workbench that has managed to clip through a wall slightly.
---
I like to leave raw fertilizer on the bed, but thats just me.
---
Not really. That is a question of ethics. It took a century or more with increasing isolation in a desolate world before they turned into purely hoarding energy weapons and hiding in their bunkers.
---
It was modded though.
---
My thoughts exactly, i just don't understand the blatant disregard for the fan base who has been loyal throughout this games constant problems. No one wanted these restrictions to endgame grinding.
---
My issue is that I've done it 15 times and still don't have The Fixer.
---
How?
---
Yeah but the people who make the event happen should get compensated because they carried the fucking event
---
A handful of locations can only be used used by 1 player/team at a time, Lowes Taxidermy is another. You have to wait until they are finished although its often easier to just jump server.
---
you are the kid who returns a wallet with the cash still in it, right on
---
Yup did this one 2 then drop the legs for a low lev guy
---
I get lagged to death there.. I dont do it very often
---
Just a person sick of getting nothing despite being the only person playing the objectives at events.
---
Nah I feel you, it's just funny.
---
I pop a Lunchbox and Canned Meat Stew during SBQ
---
Still doesn’t change the fact it was already completed by many
---
By getting a woman... ***PREGANANAN?!***
---
Good, can someone share this information with the bastards that love to build on cliff sides? I mean, I get the view is cool but JFC it's annoying to have to climb a mountain just to buy something because visitors spawn at the bottom of the cliff.
---
It's not like we can steal anything though
---
I upvoted because you mentioned S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
---
My comment was a plea to the devs that might actually change the way they do things in the future. If you don’t like my opinion ignore it.
---
Who is making you do that grind? You're just upset because you're going to have to work if you want to get the best rewards.
---
Fallout...5? When? Where? What?
---
I've used a gauss rifle fairly exclusively since the start and it has felt really off lately - and not the charging issue, which is easy to adjust to.  So many misses at 95% in vats (6 in a row once), odd aiming, refusing to enter VATS, refusing to leave VATS, refusing to reload without switching weapons.....
---
all the while severely limiting players ability to collect atoms through gameplay.
---
Thats when you huck a nuke grenade at the winners and clean house
---
I did a couple of Radiation Rumbles with teams, still no one would get the ores and totally incompetent in stopping the little glowing ones when I went to grab the ores. So many melee level 100 something running around trying to tag every ghoul for loot but can’t kill any. The ones in PAs do the same as a farm fest. When the events fail everyone gave thumbs up, apparently only for the loots from ghouls lol
---
This must be destroyed and casted into the fires of hell
---
Shipping us off to a battle royale is not the end all be all for pvp. There needs to be more than 1 style if you want that to work. Team deathmatch/capture the flag type stuff.
---
This post scared me for a second the burrows is my go-to
---
I always join Monster Mash, nobody ever play and you get a ton of XP
---
&gt;FATTESTBATMAN0 points · 27 minutes ago  
---
&gt;I have  4000.38 rounds because I really want tons of 5mm and 50. and now i am going to have to use a broken system for so many rounds.
---
You don´t have to, Bethesda is not forcing you to.
---
I'd been forgetting to do that too. I have a typical 4 point lone wanderer build (temporarily modified into a 6 point LW/Tenderiser until Adrenaline gets fixed) but I started sharing rank 2 of Inspirational for the extra XP.
---
I'm so used to wandering around alone it just didn't register with me that LW won't work while teamed until this morning.
---
The patch notes contains one comment that contradicts what was said in the recent Q &amp; A in the article about seasons.  If they are going to put out stuff like that Q &amp; A and then contradict it in the notes and EVERYONE is making threads asking about it they should address it.
---
If next week is going to replace the XP repeatable challenge with a public event one then Tell us.
---
Also, was just discussing this in a thread with people the other day, I have never seen such a sorry excuse for patch notes in an MORPG game.  They constantly leave things out or do not put in enough specifics.  Where were the mentions about carnivore and herbivore being buffed?  Where are the changes detailing the workshop icon changes?  What other stealth nerfs and buffs were in there?
---
Yeah, it does. At 3/5.
---
People thinks they did not get any score points from it, but the truth is that they got it early, not  when they finished all 5 part.
---
This would be so helpfull
---
Ok, no one forces you. Just play like you did before.
---
Ok he has it for you. Enjoy!
---
Gamertag?
---
I play Bloodied so I always got CSS and get the Ore, then hide and shoot legs out.
---
Yes. Use dense. Do not bother with fireproof. The 10 extra pounds of carry weight shouldn't be that big of a deal
---
People really will complain about anything these days huh
---
They make progress for sure but for example the adrenaline perk card doesn't work currently, the fast travel bug, or you can only respawn at vault 76 because it somehow screws up your carry weight, keeping empty ultracite fusion core plasma cores in the inventory, not be able to trade with the whitespring station bot etc. There r so many more
---
That’s fair lol
---
Nope, that’s why I’m thinking bug or glitch
---
Just a personal update from yesterday. I ended up jumping on at like 11pm. My challenges showed daily as 2/8 I think in top right. But actually looking at them, none were checked off. So I have no idea the rhyme or reason lol.
---
Great!  I'm glad you're realizing that you are not forced to do anything in the game as opposed to the other people who complain it's too grindy and want all the rewards with none of the effort.  I don't agree but up-vote for you for realizing you have a choice in the matter.
---
I’d say invest in fireproof so you can switch it off and on with other perks as you need it.
---
1. Firemans outfit - normal. Worthless
---
2. Firebreather - eh, 1k is ok for it, looks cool
---
3. Responder - 0 1% and sells for 60k to 90k because Todd loves us.
---
Because it's like playing hide-and-seek where you are always the hider.
---
 I try to grab as much stuff as I possibly can and then find a good place to hide. When the fire stuff moves I find a different place to hide.
---
 Usually always end up in the top 10 or better without firing a single shot. That part of NW is fun for me. Nuclear Winter as a whole I couldn't care less about.  I am only there for the s.c.o.r.e.
---
You can use shotty’s too
---
Yea my camp is right next to a moth man spawn hes always there it seems (camp is just south west of the junk yard)
---
https://youtu.be/5hbqipR1150
---
too many clicks requires, too slow
---
i just gave back and went back to farm more books
---
I hear you. But people being so framiliar with the way it was done in NV and then having to deal with what we have now im pretty sure the comparison is making people salty. Or just even the slownes, it sounds worse than the vendors. But its such a good and long time requested conept thats seems to have been poorly executed so i cant see people letting this one go until it changes.
---
I accept I'll never be able to finish this season - I have work (Covid didn't make a difference in my business), plus all the other normal stresses of life, I just have to accept it.
---
What would have made all of this work and impressed me a LOT with them, would have been if there was no time limit to the season. The season is there and there's a nice bonus for those who could complete it within the time period, but the event went on until you completed it at whatever pace you liked.
---
HOWEVER - you don't get to start the next one until the old one is finished or perhaps abandon it. This would allow for casual players to play longer getting those rewards eventually while those who can spend the time get a nice bonus and get to move into the next season right away.
---
How’s that level up challenge going? I’m a 468 and find that to be a bit of a bitch to complete (every single day). Also a majority of the progress made initially is tied to completing the weekly challenges which award more score than the daily’s but are only once per week.
---
I already miss the first day. Got home and had to update. The update took for ever for some reason. Went to bed and it was still downloading.
---
No. You playing the instruments made the event shorter and kept the chances for loot lower.
---
You bring the bar to 3/4ths then just kill the ghouls. Good chance for legendarys.the end boss is not max level. They were farming. You were rushing, they are probably just as annoyed with you as you are with them
---
You may choose to refuse to run it but it'll count you ingame activities and xp gains regardless. All you end up doing is advancing slower towards rewards you won't be claiming.
---
So there's no need to huff and puff for the maximum ranks if all you want is the useful-but-flawed ammo converter.
---
I play bloodied too, when I protect the miners nobody would get ores, as soon as I go get ores the miners will start dying one by one. It appears most just go there to loot a few dead ghouls and scrips, nobody cares about the success of the event itself.
---
Well if you don’t decide to do it what content is left?
---
A battle Royal mode with the fall out franchise fan base was never a good idea to begin with.
---
But the seasons are really just a continuum to their ways of handling the endgame. Only the board is something new, but the activities are the same.
---
Im aware of the free-nium game model, it just shouldn't be implemented in a game that isn't free. It is despicable to implement this system in a full game that people have payed up to $60. Im not too caught up on the microtransaction part of the season, more so the daily restriction/caps, but i do see how it is connected and therefore is unlikely to change.
---
Yea so much for only being in one place he moved on me yesterday and was standing outside
---
All you have to do is turn on the jukebox and the event carries itself.  Playing instruments just makes the event end faster which is cool if that's what you want I guess, but it means less xp and loot, and possibly missing out on extra legendary drops.
---
Thank you for convincing me to buy Fo1st and just use a private server
---
All mine popped up at 3/5 completion
---
Yeah i think people are finally starting to catch on.  Tuesday night I had a building team going and it was hard to keep it full but last night my building team was full almost the full evening for that juicy +4 INT exp boost to everything as opposed to JUST events.
---
I'm happy they aren't going to remove.  I missed those events so I'm over the moon I've had a 2nd chance.
---
So is the intelligence public team thing the way to go or event xp?
---
It was one hell of a battle to fight both of them at the same time, not gonna lie through my 400 hours never experienced this much fun in a long time.
---
One could dream... :(
---
True, that's why I hope they change the way events work. We cannot rely on the fact that anyone will do their part, unfortunately.
---
The only good thing about this machine is when you move through the menus, it remembers your last selection and always highlights the last ammo selection you were on. You don't need to keep going up and down in the menu. But you can't spam the buttons to speed up the process because you might accidentally scrap ammo you want to keep, unless you take the time to remove your "good" ammo from your inventory first. Which is probably why it's designed this way so you're not scrapping ammo that's in your stash, only your inventory. 
---
Even though it has a few good points I still think it's a flop because it's insulting that I can't CONVERT ammo in an AMMO CONVERTER directly into another form of ammo at a 1:1 ratio. Making us convert it to points first in small stacks and basically loosing ammo in the conversion process is a joke. 1000 rounds of .38 should be directly converted into 1000 rounds of 5.56 or whatever else you want. Stop trying to create the Fallout immersion experience with giving the damn machine a lore aspect with the stupid point system. There's no logical reason why we can't just do a direct conversion of ammo. That's what the name implies and what we all hoped for. I swear these devs don't even play this game or value our time. Shit like this wants to make me become a duper just to get back lost time at this failure of a machine.
---
Did you do those things before to get atoms? No? Ok well don’t do them now and do the same thing you were doing before.
---
Last time i checked him was standing inside his bed :D
---
They are still there, I got a tse hunting rifle last night only level 10 though from a bog horde, people are doing the more now cuz they are quick xp with the boosted team xp
---
They do still pop up occasionally
---
Double unyielding trick?
---
Try server hopping, but yes they are still in the game.
---
Yes.
---
I was just explaining how most people play that event.
---
Good though, if you've got the money to burn do it. If that's what makes you happy 👍
---
Survival of the fittest. I got bored of melting people with assult rifles so i changed to scrubby mele and explosives build with frog legs and i gota say its pretty dang fun. Especially with the explosive bow in the game now
---
They are easier than the old ones were - and Level Ups aren't confined to a single character (just create a new one &amp; by the time you get to the Wayward, you're already level 3).
---
Every time you did it?
---
Ha ha sounds good but I don’t pick up anything when bush hiding... don’t wanna give my killer the satisfaction of looting me or potentially help them with whatever I was carrying.
---
&gt;"You will begin “The Legendary Run” at Rank 1, and you can advance your position on the board by earning S.C.O.R.E. through your Daily and Weekly Challenges. These include completing Public Events and leveling up your character."
---
Now.. Log into game and do an event, public or normal. Do you get s.c.o.r.e.? Can it be any clearer?
---
100%.  I honestly have no problem paying for expansion in the first place.  If they are warranted, and I like the game, then I welcome them.  I think people actually LIKE to support developers that they feel make good games and respect them as customers.
---
I’ve probably server hopped thousands of times and never found one, my rng must suck
---
Saving all my lunchboxes for the next double XP weekend. 🙏🙏🙏
---
Listen!  I said one more time mate and I'll take you to the fucking cleaners.
---
That sounds more like an area north of Lake Elaine and near the vault, there’s a long gorge with a stream running through it, in at least one spot there’s a narrow walkway across a high point. I’m pretty sure there was a lower crossing too. I built there once because I wanted to try a secluded location but was visited often by high level super mutants that would do a number on my camp while I was away. Nice looking spot though.
---
I'm already at tier 14. I honestly don't think getting to 100 is going to be that hard. Plus, it kind of makes sense to make it a little difficult to reach the end. It makes sense for someone to be rewarded for all the grinding and dedication.
---
I preordere the tricentennial edition and i still lost it.
---
No. Just did a yao guau horde last night
---
I did not, sorry for the confusion.
---
Last night I went to do his daily, talked to him left to go find the part, did uranium fever on my way back to him,and when I got back he was in a different place
---
If it is the placement of the tents keeping her from landing standing on top of them  makes absolutely no difference
---
It’s like friggin grunt birthday
---
I have a feeling even if you are addicted to it it also probably feels shitty, you just can't stop yourself.  The worst thing is that these kind of tactics are AIMING for people like that.
---
🤯
---
So don't do it if you don't want to, why even bother making a post? 
---
 I like many others enjoy it.  I quite enjoy having things to do again.
---
You dont need to go to those events and some of us also enjoy doing events in nuke zones...
---
Thanks.  It's a lot more than a 6% change in damage from one rank.
---
Is Responder the blue one?
---
Fallout 76 is a big money maker for Bethesda right now so I assume they'll continue to support it for years to come.
---
Still there. I walked straight in to a Giant Cricket horde of jumpy, bitey b******s after exiting a building and got a 3* Legendary rifle as a reward...a reward for dieing as I did expect them to be outside. - I hate the way the map marker jumps around at times rather than smoothly following their progress.
---
Theres one by the nuka cola plant. Just a bit north along the river.
---
That explains a few things - I saw someone at Uranium Fever the other night in T-65, they kept their distance but the paint job on it looked out of place. I now know it was the Atomic Onslaught paint that doesn't unlock for T-65 until level 76.
---
The irony is the people glitching their way to completion will be the first ones in the queue to start bitching about how they're bored and there's nothing for them to do.
---
&gt; Hopefully Bethesda will see people either burn out from doing the same things over and over again every single day,
---
Wastelanders end game says hi.
---
Also had the same problem with the build up a camp challenge.
---
 completed, no score.  (PS4)
---
White helmet, black body with USA flag = responder
---
Still love my communist bot.
---
i got the paladin paint today, but took quite awhile before it drops. so grinding for the next level now
---
Hi everyone,
---
There is an error in our Seasons FAQ, which we plan to correct. Right now, there are Challenges to complete Events and Public Events that grant S.C.O.R.E. At this time, however, Public Events themselves do not currently grant S.C.O.R.E., though this is something we're talking about as a potential addition as we look to bring further improvements to Seasons in the future.
---
We apologize for the confusion about this, and we will make sure that information is corrected.
---
The fabled Reverse Vampire's Rolling Pin.  That's a keeper.
---
This is a thing?  I've never tried NW (no real interest or skill in battle royale style games).  It doesn't piss off other players?
---
I just alt F4 out of the game. I didn't play the last month maybe that's why I never saw this before.
---
That's what I'm wondering too. Though I think it's more on what you plan on doing. For casual play, I'd pick the Int one over the actual Casual (Luck bonus). But if you're going to target Events, getting 4x EXP from a full group is probably better.
---
I did one last night. It was one those weird ones that shows up in the middle of the map but if you fast travel to it, it spawns u under ground.

I will get three or four levels a day and will get close to finishing 100 before the season is over.  If I don't make it to 100 that's fine since I have so much other shit I don't or can't use in this game because of storage, building or weight limits.  After two years and over 300 levels I am the king of my XBox world with or without it!
---
Got to get fo1st so Todd gets money for his penis enlargment = Fanboys are happy
---
FFS thats the one i threw out
---
Yeah i kinda figured, but what good are shareholders when the core playerbase dies out due to poor endgame mechanics? I just dont understand the blatant disregard bethesda has shown us, almost everybody doesnt want daily limits/caps and this game isn't getting any newer.
---
 Q: ASIDE FROM CHALLENGES, WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE MY S.C.O.R.E.?
---
A: In Season 1, **you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events.** Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
This is ambiguous.  Furthermore, you had folks coming on here and saying "oh I got it for encryptid or I got it for scorched earth but only if I launched the nuke" etc.  How can you not understand how this could be confusing for some people?
---
There was a lot of confusion and still is.  If I was a community manager I would take a couple minutes out of my day to address these concerns considering it has been a hot topic of conversation these last couple days.
---
I used to be able to share lvl 5 cards while bloodied out and in my unyeailding armor. I have 4 in charisma, but the armor gave an extra 15. Or temporarily share cards before with party boy 3, magnetic personallity, or grape mentats. But as of like 2 patches ago it's no longer possible to share cards this way, and just runs off your base line character specs. Not sure if this was broke to start with, or is been broke. But I miss being able to share lvl 5 cards. Or even a lvl 3 for someone who didn't have lvl 3 animal friend and wanted to tame a pet.
---
Because clearly, if you miss even a single day's challenges, that's another 1,000 you have to make up.  And another.  And another.
---
Hell, even if you choose to ignore the Nuclear Winter challenges, that's still a massive amount of SCORE you need to make up somehow.  Saying, "Oh, you can grind XP for dinky 100 increments" isn't a panacea.  You'd still have to hit that something like 300 times.
---
"It shouldn't be easy to complete" is a dumb argument.  None of this is *difficult*.  This isn't some hardcore challenge.  It's only a matter of time investment.  The only way you'd see it to the end is if you logged in diligently every day, leveled up 1.5 times, and hit the XP thing about 3 times a day.  People who work jobs are shit out of luck, and Bethesda has wound their grind so tightly that it is simply impossible for them.
---
Public Events don't count for SCORE either despite the page originally saying so.  That would have been a decent supplement for the XP grind, but it turned out to be some weasel wording where they only count if there's a challenge associated with them.
---
Interestingly enough, you know who it isn't impossible for?  The exploiters.  They've already gamed some kind of exploit to get all 100 levels.  Something Bethesda will do nothing about.
---
I completely agree with the lack of content but you don't have to do the Legendary Run... It is free stuff just for doing some easy tasks, so I'm not sure why you're so against it aside from the lack of other stuff.
---
&gt; and now has a pay-to-advance option for it's season pass. 
---
That also completely nerfed the ability to earn atoms by playing, functionally making all aspects of the game that require atoms more expensive.
---
Took me a year and a ton of caps and a JE rifle to get my set. RIP my guy.
---
Does this read on payth notes?
---
That's funny I saw Wren sneaking out of there this morning.
---
Good point from you both. I'll do that with all my permanent gear
---
I see them very frequently on my private server (like hourly almost), but i never remember seeing any in the week i played before buying 1st.
---
I feel bad for those who grinded in Nuclear Winter to get the ghillie suit and now they see everyone else with one. This reminds me of when Star Wars Galaxies went through their major overhaul to make the game a WoW clone to attract more players. Before the change, it was very hard and a random chance at becoming a Jedi and it came with permadeath. After the update? 10k Jedi running around at lvl 1 wearing haloea on their heads and bats wings on their backs, mocking Star Wars lore.
---
I got scammed yesterday
---
I'm 351 now.  If it gets too grindy i'll just get on my level 17 alt.
---
What's wrong with it? It worked okay for me.
---
This applies to the expected damage of both charged and uncharged shots.
---
Thank you to everyone for all of the Ammo Converter feedback over the past few days. We are already actively looking into potential improvements we can bring to the Ammo Converter to make that experience smoother. We don't have details on those changes at this time since they are still being discussed, but as soon as our plans are more concrete we will share those changes with all of you.
---
Here's the info:
---
Herbivore: Eat veggies gain double benefit and no disease
---
Cranberry Relish: Bonus XP +25%
---
Brain Fungus Soup: INT +5
---
So, you now get double the XP bonus of any plant based food with an Xp modifier.  I used this last night and was seeing increased benefit.
---
it was from the ITV a week ago in the article on seasons.  So I don't even think you can say it was during development if it happened less than a week before release.
---
something isnt making sense...youre saying since wastelanders...in april... you havent seen a single horde event? thousands of server hops?
---
That doesnt make sense at all...unless you join a server and leave after 5 seconds.
---
okay just making sure credit is actually being given, i might have gotten them then. Ill check the math on rank
---
No. I got disconnected as I was fast traveling to a yao guai horde event yesterday.... I was looking forward to farming a bit of acid off them...

XP, Loot, Legendaries, and it's all so easy. 
---
I miss way back when you could trigger it by server hopping.
---
I scan each event marker and if it doesn’t say horde I hop to another
---
It’s hard to say since event xp gets doubled can an 8% increase to everything. I guess it really depends on the events going on but if your not actually doing events continuously I’d say int would be better
---
its not x4 exp, its 100% bonus.
---
Right there with you!  It's my second-favorite Fallout weapon, after the Anchorage pattern gauss Rifle.
---
Well obviously they decided to change it as it clearly says where you get score in 3 different places after patch.
---
I ALWAYS get rare outifts. Insurgents, White Powder, Resp. Fire, Old Man Winter Helm, Urban scout mask, Forest scout and others but I never get any good weapond. I have been doing so many Encryptids
---
It's better than nothing, but at the same time is implemented in such a frustrating way.  There are so many ways to have done this better like letting you break down ammo at a bench.  I think the annoying part is it feels contrived into being a reward item instead of just being added as a basic gameplay mechanic.  That said, it's better than nothing and I will use it one the ammo I can't sell.  It just represents another "coulda been" addition in 76.  I'm used to it and I still enjoy the game.
---
I **hate** just dumping things on the ground. It feels so wasteful. For me, the ammo converter is a way to **use** that garbage ammo rather than dump it out or try to find some lowbie to sucker into carrying 1000 rounds of .38. So, the converter sucks, but right now it's the only way I know of to use shitty ammo outside of shooting into the sky.
---
depends if you want to free up 3 points from endurance.
---
Still 40 scrip
---
As long as you queue up solo why should it bother anyone. It’s tactical. The goal of the game is to last until the end. Yea a lot of people hide in bushes and sneak around. It gets a little nerve racking sometimes.
---
so you are leaving after just a few moments?
---
Because even randomly when i hop servers...i still see them
---
Im just finding it very hard to believe you havent seen a single one in almost 3 months
---
Lots of solo players jumping on the new system, I'm guessing. Never figured they would need Charisma or the need to share a perk.
---
Thanks for the announcement. Always good to know what Vendor\_bot is or isn't doing. Not like you can not do it perfectly fine. Also they should hide NW option when choosing a game mode, since i don't participate in it...
---
I would love to be able to level lock items in the vendor machine for this reason. I'd like to "pay forward" some of the kindness other players showed me when I was starting out, but I play alone mostly so being able to leave free stuff for low levels at my CAMP would be ideal.
---
Don't forget your steaming hot bowl of Mexican Ghillie in case you get hungry out in the wastes.
---
Yes, I know, I'll get my coat. My ghillie coat no less...
---
&gt;i know you have plans for this game for many years to come, but please if its just new events or skins or weapons just keep the game fresh as we will still be play
---
I really do hope so!
---
So, no new actual in game content, like events or quests.  They take away our ability to earn atoms and get what we want from the store by playing, and lock it behind a 10 week long grind.  No fix to the perk card system.  Nothing new for nuclear winter like.... a map, or goals, or a purpose, or stat tracking KD win loss hit miss.   But we can buy more levels with cash money, so we got that going for us, which is nice. Lol.

I stopped hacking turrets in silos because of this. These days I just rambo through. Fuck dealing with lag lol.
---
Right, my bad.
---
As one of the rare high-Charisma, high-Int builds, I generally suck at the killing of things and am a far, FAR cry from the usual face-melting power that I see people throw out during big events. Like, a single Sheepsquatch, by myself, is often a 15 minute ordeal, burning through a dozen stimpacks and piles of ammunition. Then I do a public event and watch someone kill it so fast I don't even have a chance to ping it with my lil' 10 MM pistol. (Level 250 by the by. Not new at all, just … not good at fighting.)
---
.
---
BUT! That 9 Charisma has a use now in that I can share perks.
---
The question the becomes this: What perks do people usually NOT have but would like to have shared? Because I'm happy to put mine on and give the rest of the team a boost. Just let me know what you'd like and it's on.
---
I’d honestly be more worried about the new elder scrolls killing it, 76 will hemorrhage players once that comes out in 2 years or so. FO5 isn’t even close to being released and I wouldn’t expect it to release till 3-4 years from now with that me being optimistic. Elder scrolls tho is for some reason just a gamer glue trap, the Skyrim subreddit is still incredibly active almost a decade after its release, so who knows how many people will migrate to the new ES and stay there
---
Hold your horses there champ. Starfield is next!  Most likely a 2021 PS5 release. Pretty excited about that.
---
 Once that game releases you won't see me in fo76 for a long time.
---
She also doesn't land when there are too many people sitting ontop of V9, or if anyone builds a giant landing platform, she just needs to be able to target people, the best place to fight her is the field east of V9!
---
Hey that's my favorite event. It's really easy to solo and the rewards are usually good.
---
...or you could sell it .... to me ... please
---
Thanks, really appreciate it!!
---
I have a stack of crap secret service armors because i can't do anything with them and it will take another 2 days to get rid of them assuming i don't get any other legendaries.  The pace of this game is artificially slowed.   Two more weeks till Ghosts and i can put this down for a while.
---
Common knowledge since 2018.
---
Scrip, or where you can exchange it for other legendaries that someone else didn’t want
---
And just like that, the point has reached takeoff and gone directly over your head
---
Thank you, but this release it kind of broken and then fix it later approach is really frustrating to keep having to go through
---
Good point!
---
Or AWOL Armaments for some weird reason. They are both fun.
---
It's true but when 90% of all content added to the game a year and a half since launch (a trend highly, highly, likely to continue in perpetuity), has been via the cash shop, or the new system that highly incentivizes more spending, while simultaneously all but removing players ability to earn Atoms via gameplay, in this what is meant to be an ongoing game, while also considering the inventory system is a huge hassle if you don't pay for the subscription, you have to agree that it's not a player friendly development plan.
---
Just think of it as another fallout4. For the price of one game you will be getting hundreds of hours of content. FWIW, i would recommend getting a month of the premium membership. Having your own private world and infinite stash space is a massive qol. But you can effortlessly move your chars from public to private servers and back.
---
Yep. The terminal should just be a vendor with sell ammo for points (up to 2000) / buy ammo for points (no limit)...
---
He's just helping you out. 
---
There is a certain etiquette to a lot of events, One Violent Night is one where you only fix and use the Jukebox to lure Ghouls in to a single location for a maximum amount of time with minimal effort. 
---
If you had been doing it with them instead of playing an Instrument, you could have been dipping in on that 10-15minutes of free xp and loot, since all you need to do is do any damage to get credit. Making it easier for you to level and finish your build. 
---
A Private Server won't help much if you're working against yourself, and this game is better with people, you'll level up faster with the presence and assistance from others. 🤷
---
I know right, rng is crazy. I just haven’t, and it is really sad because I just want to farm some legendaries
---
Ya I dont run alts or play NW so I've come to grips knowing I wont make it to the end on the score grind
---
I got spooked by a wise Mothman once, one shot him and since you arn't supposed to kill him, he T-posed instead of meltong into dust!
---
I think im just going to play normally (not getting every single point feasible), until they figure out about events / other sources.  imho the "good rewards" are all at the end, so if they make is ridiculously difficult, im just not going to bother playing much at all.   i can think of better things to do with my time than grinding 3 hours everyday for 3 months straight lol
---
Way to snuff out what little hope we had of eventually getting a reasonable season grind.
---
You can already get those from the purveyor 😅 and most player vendors..
---
&gt;Reading be hard.
---
Agreed. And comprehension is even harder for most. Plus. Just go in and play the dam game. You can look up the challenges. Do those. Then do other stuff. If you get points for doing other stuff, guess what, you figured something out for yourself. Sheesh.
---
Thats not true i have seen her land on top of the platform building made by another player
---
This is most peoples problem, i dont see why bethesda refuses to listen to players and continue strangling the ingame economy and endgame content. It makes no sense, youd think theyd want people more invested in the game not turned off by what you CANT do today or at all.
---
That is weird. A few months ago I lockpicked an abandoned workshop without being wanted.
---
That's not a common occurrence and doesn't warrant its supposed value though.
---
Picking it myself doesn't validate the perk or solve the issue of balance though so it doesn't help me either, with the amount of other pvp games I play, it's very clear to see the lack of balance this game offers
---
Wait so I don’t need it a legendary scrap for the armor
---
Public events *should* award SCORE and it should be changed quickly. It feels awful that my friends feel like there’s no incentive to continue playing once we complete daily chores, and that there’s no meaningful progression outside of challenges.
---
I was on the same boat.  I bought the PC version back in Jan after beta.  But never played it because I had everything on my Xbox account.  
---
Now since returning for wastelanders since sold the Xbox so I had no choice but to start over.  I would switch back in an instant if PC gamepass had my purchases and progress.
---
Dunno mate, being hoarder i cant miss 5str 😋, with only 1 point 25 carry weight, enemies die fast enough anyway
---
Could you please next time put these devices up on the PTS first so that you can actually get the feedback BEFORE the feature launches?
---
Would help to avoid a lot of issues.
---
If you need to buy script you aint playing the game right.
---
Hmm, I sure do wonder whether people gaining millions of exp within 48 hours will stand out in any way
---
*Offer a space-themed season,*
---
*Make all armor cosmetics ghillie*
---
My last 4 times fighting up there, she was in the sky the whole fight, if I was on my unarmed build I would have been very angry, thankfully we all had enough firepower to down her without landing!
---
That aside, as it isn't player friendly. We are mainly talking about cosmetic atom store stuff, none of which is needed to enjoy the game one bit. The issue is the lack of *actual* content, I don't class anything in the store or part of the current legendary season as content, it's just fluff. 
---
I would much prefer them put 90% of the effort into actual content and the last 10% for the cash store, but hey it's not up to me.
---
You can get the buttressed and jetpack.  Yes it's worth it!! My personal favorite item in the game. Love the mobility it affords!!
---
That sucks. I rolled a gorgeous quad +50 vats crit that was a ton of fun before I took a break from the game. Why is it shotguns are the subject of endless nerfs?
---
Will an added +8% XP for all the mobs you kill in a swarm/wave event be greater than the event XP reward itself (+100% event XP)?  That would be a hard question to answer with a lot of variables, though.  Unless it's an unusually rich event reward, or an event with tons of mobs thrown at you (Line in the Sand? Heart of the Swamp?), they may come out more or less the same.  That's just an off-the-cuff guess, though.
---
I went into FO76 saying to myself I was going to treat this like it was another just another FO1-4, a finite amount of story before the game feels like it natural ends.  Any enjoyment in the end-game would be extra.  It has worked in my head, and hasn't been spoiled like Destiny 2 and its seasons.
---
Maybe I'm not made for MMOs.....
---
I think we pretty much all like what it can do, we just dont like how it does it.
---
The interface is da poop.
---
&gt; I still don't see the point in a skin for the C.A.M.P. 
---
Especially since you have to relocate your camp entirely for the skin to even appear. :|
---
It’s balanced because everyone has access to same weapons and cards. I’m surprised you find this game less balanced than other games where you can load in with specific weapons. 
---
Anyway we can agree to disagree here. I just don’t see frog legs as an issue at all.
---
way more balanced and tamed compared to PvP in adventure lol
---
Id argue its the most fair BR I've played. Besides from hackers, every fight feels like a fight i can win or lose. 
---
Unlike most BRs where I can almost straight away tell.
---
I wish someone with more time on their hands could do the math for a few events
---
every time i have to select a location 3 times to fast travel, i think about quitting.
---
&gt; and others games,
---
... That also have (better) battle passes.
---
I feel like they are missing how these game pass things are supposed to work.
---
option 1: regular casual game play for the entire time = completion
---
option 2: grind super hard = complete in half the time
---
option 3: pay real money = complete immediately
---
IDK why they are going with option 4, where you have to grind hard AND pay money in order to complete.  dont they realize that no one is going to chose that option?  people will just go play something else
---
Obviously once you get to level 50+ and get the right gear and perks you will be quite strong.
---
Once you know where to look and the most efficient methods, you will have more mats and ammo than you know what to do with.  I haven't gone out of my way to farm anything in months, just pick up what's around doing my other activities and I've kept 5 characters supplied fine.
---
Half of this game is just know-how.
---
Nuclear Winter is actually very skill based. The amount of times I've clutched games based purely off skill, things I learned, using mechanics to help me. 
---
Frog legs is annoying yes, but at least you can counter it. 
---
Try going against somebody with a gauss shotgun and the right build for it. Thing is a sniper rifle and up close its a death sentence with no room for error.
---
This makes me a sad panda
---
Well, to bad there is no real enemy where you can use it :( SBQ is nearly immune to explosive damage, other enemies will die instant when you are just point a pipe pistol on them...
---
But yeah, this weapon would be cool against a real enemy.
---
It doesn't even make sense for us to be able to build this thing out of tin cans and old coffee makers and have it in our CAMPs. How is it getting ammo and where is it putting the ammo we feed it? If we are clever enough to be able to build this mofo ourselves, why are we locked into a point system? This seems more like a machine that should have been installed at railway stations next to the Legendary Scrip kiosk and unlocked for use when you get to SCORE level 5.
---
Everyone having access to the same shitty weapons is not a definition of balance, that's what becomes a meta. Balance is where every weapon has the same lethality and time to kill based on various factors and traits of the individual weapon. You shouldn't have to be forced to use a certain weapon because it's better than others, or use a certain perk because it's better than others.
---
1. Modding weapons will make them more powerful. Look up and plan towards a good legendary build. I'd recommend junkies, nice and easy, nothing to maintain but 50% damage boost with 5 addictions (chosen wisely). 
---
2. Ammo becomes less an issue, especially when you can rank up the raiders and get the ammo machine. There's good farming guides to get lead, steel and gunpowder are easy to come by.
---
Glad you're having fun! I got my character up to level 130 and now I'm levelling up a new one for different weapons. Happy to help you with anything if you need help.
---
totally. I feel like I've been through it and come out the otherside now and don't find this sort of stuff appealing at all any more. But before that it was like how can I get everything in my life that needs doing asap so I can grind X or Y game season? Gross.
---
You have more time for ghouls to spawn if you do it slowly and only progress using the jukebox
---
It's the way the game handles physics, if something falls for any length of time, it lands in a different place for everyone, this is why people are so angry when grenades are thrown when trying to loot bodies, you can't point out the body for someone as it went in a random direction for everyone!
---
They broke adrenaline, none of the rest of this matters as much as that does. I do not run the same bloody meta build that 90% of players do. All five of my characters use adrenaline. This update is a huge damage nerf to me because of this. I will not play at all until it is fixed.
---
What i'm gonna do is play the game and if i get to 100 i get to 100. 
---
And if i don't i'll carry on regardless.
---
yes. yes please. I'm tired of some asshole molerat eating my plants and then i have to scavenge to fix the plants
---
Watch twitch, watch youtube videos, read here, you'll learn a ton.
---
(In next Xzibit impression) Yo dawg, I heard you like Ghillie suits...
---
You will have got them for doing 3/5 objectives. I got the robot one yesterday and only done 3 of them. They need to fix this soon as they can because it's mega confusing and shouldn't be happening with this kind of time gated stuff that people worry about getting.
---
The hell is wrong with people downvoting someone asking for evidence? You people are everything that's wrong with the world right now.
---
hug bushes and wait, stick close to the ring of fire, move, repeat
---
finishing 3rd get you like 640 points
---
and only shoot to kill
---
I am legitimately asking a question. What is the difference between pvp in adventure and pvp in nw for you guys?  Why do you not like pvp in nw?
---
Weird stuff happens. The other day I got a wanted for picking corn at my own camp. Corn! That I planted.
---
Crazy idea: don't repair anything, at the cost of 40 caps,
---
Rebuild your camp using the stored items,
---
Watch the magic unfurl as all your resource intensive heavy lasers and missile turrets spin back to life :)
---
It's dog shit.
---
Yes. Dense nullifies scorchbeast blasts
---
You’re correct. Magnetic Personality works as a charisma buff and doesn’t effect your SPECIAL values in the sense that you can share a higher level perk card or have an additional perk card. You’d need 15 base charisma to be able to share a rank 5 card regardless of any equipment/food/perk buffs.
---
That’s not how it works...you are only a true fallout fan if you constantly complain about the grind, the ammo converter, or for the love of god how could they possibly release a weapon skin that has hand clipping. Just an atrocity. Everyone that looks past all of these insane injustices has to either be a Bethesda paid whale, a boot licker, or have a mental disorder. And don’t forget to throw in the clown emoji....
---
U mean lead
---
Allow me to show you Bethesda's response:

---
I think it's meant here more as a way to increase the scrip we can get outside of the daily machine limits.  As well as to give another cap sink for those of us that need them.
---
Shoot at queen.  50 damage.
---
I've done most of last 2 days of dailies and 3/4 of weekly and I'm at prize mark 8
---
I don't use the word "hero" often, but you are the greatest hero in American history.
---
The game is literally flooded with legendary gear to scrip.
---
Been doing that. The bug showed up when they made fast travel from interiors and fast travel with a timer around enemies. They always say how they have to recreate the problem or need more information to fix a problem. Looks like they either do not care to fix it or non of the developers play the game enough to get mad about it. This is almost a year old bug that has affected everyone at some point and makes the game not worth playing sometimes.
---
I've always hoarded Bubblegum, and any of the building ones I just take over a workshop and make the cheapest things wherever they'll go. Usually uses the workshop resources instead of mine.
---
I'm grinding 76's battle pass and rainbow 6's, it's a hard knock life atm. Had to put 7 days to die's update on the back burner
---
Wheres the ammo machine?
---
I won't play until adrenaline is fixed. If my car has a spare tire on it, I'll choose to not drive until it's repaired. Except of course to go to work, because I have to. But this game is not my job, and I will not play until they fix my favorite perk card.
---
That’s even worse! Just when you think you’ve seen it all
---
I need to ween my girlfriend off of it. She is a huge Fallout fan. More than me even but man I don't even know what she plays this. Between bugs, server issues, and griefers I think this game is making her miserable.
---
You can run builder for the majority of an event then switch to event before it ends. You don't lose bonds when switching group type.
---
Aside from holding the button to exit out, you can also go back a screen and choose the "return to menu" option and then you can exit.
---
It doesn't have the sound like Halo.  But the effects are still pretty great!  Reminds me so much of reach :D
---
This happens to me as well.  Whenever i want to sign in to my alt account to grab stuff off my mules it will do this.  It's extremely annoying.
---
Your point?
---
Why does frog legs need to be removed? I sea nothing wrong with it at all other than utility to reaching higher platforms.
---
Are you having trouble in shooting froggers jumping around or what?
---
Ok, just wanted to tell you that pvp vats is even more bugged.
---
Definitely not me!  You could probably get some pretty exact numbers if you camped some higher level mobs that gave over 100xp or so.  I'm happy enough with the broad guesses.  Mostly just wanted to know if it was true.
---
Oh my god! ALL the bears!
---
Please don't share rad sponge or strange in numbers though. Marsupial with extra jump height is annoying.
---
3 approaches to ammo:
---
Load your own: gather materials for it religiously and consider getting the perk that doubles your recipes.
---
Invest in the perk that increases ammo found in containers and loot thoroughly.
---
Invest in hard bargain and sell a lot of shit.  Buy ammo from vending machines.
---
Personally, I don't have ANY of the above perks, and I stay ahead on ammo crafting supplies by careful looting (check every desk and shop counter for pencils!) supplemented by the occasional barbell run or claiming a workshop with a lead deposit.  Also my AA combat rifle is modded to take the more common .38 ammo, which does less damage but that's offset by the AA effect.
---
It depends on the ammo you are using. 
---
If you're talking about .45 then yeah, the ammo dispensing of just 12 rounds is pure shit. I wanted to use the Tommy gun until I realized how poor the ratio was for creating ammo. 
---
For whatever reason, the .50 rounds are always more than enough: 100 rounds per conversion. Even regular crafting, if you use full Ammo Smith, you get 180. Not to mention if you have max superduper perk, 30% chance of double. 
---
I have no idea why 5.56 and .45 rounds are so damn expensive but in this game, they just are.
---
Please take a few steps back and look at what everyone is saying:
---
You don't play the instruments, it shortens the event for everyone!
---
This means less XP and less legendarys spawning. Don't play any of the instruments, just make sure the jukebox is repaired and working and get hits on as many enemies as you can.
---
the fact that you call this an error in your seasons FAQ, and that the lack of score from events was not an error says a lot about how you view us as players, I think this might be the only developer I've seen to screw up a battlepass system so horribly. It's almost as though bethesda wants everything coming out of this game to be showered with criticism and negativity. Bethesda, you should be ashamed.
---
Replace the ammo machine if space is the issue.
---
Does "Lone Wanderer" still work if you are on a one-person team?
---
Thank you for another nifty calculator  [u/akarnokd](https://www.reddit.com/user/akarnokd/) :) Now only to figure out how to work this as i has the dumbs.
---
Hey do you still have that I’ve been trying to get one of those, I’ll buy it off you.
---
Good on ya, and kudos on a well written advert, it's nice of you to offer this to newbies. Let me know if you run out of materials or aid stuff and I'll sling some your way.
---
Well, from my experience, you will always suffer from ammo shortage, unless you invest some time in gathering lead and steel scrap. For the crafting supplies - the much bigger problem is where to store them. You either pay for fallout first subscription and get unlimited scrap storage, or you need to carefully manage what you keep and what you sell to vendors.
---
^oh ^no
---
I thought this once until I realised you don't need to play the instruments. It's one of my favourite events now for XP farming. Just use the jukebox and let it go slow for more ghoul spawns. Sit on the table against the wall opposite the jukebox in stealth, easy pickings/xp.
---
Can we just keep hating on Bethesda instead of coming up with ways to work around their obvious bullshit all the time?
---
It will drop...... Eventually
---
It sucks because the timer was reduced to 10 minutes.
---
omg orifice funny showe
---
If you are going to watch YouTube videos make sure they are at least from the last 6 months.  Occasionally see posters on this sub talking about their dream TSE shotgun they are trying to find because a YouTube video told them it was OP.
---
I've leveled lots of characters and I think you quit maybe 5 levels before the game gets really easy. Though a tip to help would be scrap all you can the more junk you have the better. And figure out what style weapons you want to use and spec for it
---
Yeah good point!
---
Its one of the early Legendary run rewards. R7 or 8 iirc. You build and place it in your camp.
---
Exactly.  They’re safely enclosed in a vault they don’t need armor or OP weapon so
---
Is it really the consumer’s responsibility to come up with fixes to this clunky and unintuitive feature?
---
Right. Does anyone ever use the ammo machines? If I need ammo urgently I'll jump around til someone is selling .45 or 5.56 for 1c each. Never hard to get.
---
How to make it better:
---
 * Assign each ammo a value for a single round
---
 * Be able to "Transfer" ammo to the converter, as much of whatever you've got.
---
 * Hit "Convert to Points"
---
 * Spend points on new ammo in whatever denomination you've got enough points for
---
They'll just need to revalue everything, I don't care if 1 5mm is "1 point" and 1 .308 is "7 points" let me dump it all in, then spend it all with a slider.
---
Thanks for the effort.  Calculator works great!  BTW you wouldn't have to kill 1000 super mutants for 40K xp, it would only take 200.  (200\*200=40k)
---
From experience, 2 runs through the DMV/Golf Course/Westek  loop will net me around 40K.
---
Eh, I was like 75% certain it was true.  But some of the nonsense that gets spread around here as "common knowledge," it was worth the five minutes it took to test and post.
---
I agree if you're grouping up for an evening and just grinding mobs, the +INT is the way to go.  But given that the group leader can swap the benefit on the fly, it's still a worthwhile question to ask.  It might be worth swapping to the +Event XP version for the length of the event, anyway.
---
Maybe too
---
Probably best to discuss it with your team.
---
If I remember right, you share loot anyhow, so it's not like they're being robbed.
---
Yeah, they need to fix what’s going on here. My rifleman build is near broken and unusable now because of the amount of glitches and bugs I’m experiencing whilst using it.
---
Do they get xp?
---
Cash grab?
---
&gt; You give us something to grind, great so far 
---
That's it, I'm getting too old for this shit. Apparently I live in a world now where endless grinding is not only accepted, but in demand by players, as a form of good game design.
---
Fucking hell, no wonder the game industry is in the state it's in. Fuck.
---
i keep a weaker weapon with me to tag legendaries if others are around
---
Good for you that it made you cringe ;)
---
I dont speak for everyone but yea go ahead and insta kill all non legendaries. Better than trying to wait for everyone to get a shot in for so little xp, get the xp from completing event
---
Dramatic
---
I'm currently farming xp with 44 int + rested bonus &lt;3 on a 4 man group. Sweetness.
---
Thanks! Right now I have a bit of a mix of perks for shotguns, pistols and non-VATS shooting. It’s a bit of a mess, so I have to work on that over the next few levels. 
---
I also just learned how to do the Scrap-a-Tron thing yesterday, so I’ve really been missing out on scrap there.
---
I think part of the reason I didn't bother with atom grind is because too many challenges were annoying. So far I haven't seen any of the bad ones in the new season-- they're all quite simple and I barely have to pay attention to the challenge menu.
---
Just the fact that doing every daily and weekly will leave you short on xp is awful. 
---
If it was up to me, doing just 70% (give or take) of ALL families and weeklies should at MINIMUM get you to 100. And the repeatable should be at least double. 
---
But The new maths on The grind still leaves you short by 5000xp. 
---
And lets be honest. There’s mostly always one Daily you just dont want to brother with or have the time for maybe. 
---
For me its The NW ones. 
---
That leaves me 19,250 Xp behind in the end from just the one quest. 
---
If you ask me it’s not correctly made. 
---
But ofc they could be monitoring this and eventually give a 2x xp weekend if they saw we were way behind “schedule”.
---
Because share-holders are only interested in short term results. They are either to stupid to see long term, or they simply don't care.
---
Thank you! Great advice. I have found a lot of articles from when the game first launched, and have noticed that it doesn’t always align to reality.
---
My lever action also randomly won’t hit 95% headshots. Whenever that happens I have to relog.
---
It still shouldn't take "less than 10 minutes" it should be 2.
---
From another topic on this:
---
They've acknowledged a bunch of bugs, but you'd have to search yourself to see if they've responded specifically to Adrenaline. 
---
If you find a post on the reddit page that has the 'Bethesda Replied' yellow marker by it, you can click that marker and it will show you all the recent posts Bethesda has replied to.
---
Auto hotkey
---
Checked that out, thanks, but not where I'm looking for.
---
I never hate the player. Until I do. XDDDDDDDDDD
---
Out of curiosity what would you rather instead of grinding?
---
Instigating FFR is bugged - it works on up to 4 shots with the FF modifier.  This is pretty easy to watch with damage indicators.  My Instigating FFR Handmade destroys my AAE and Furious FF Handmades for everything.  I don't even think Furious works, which is disappointing based on how it "should work."
---
With adrenaline being broken, a very important perk for how I like to play. No mention of a hot fix for it. Likely to be months before they address it. Big reason for me to finally take a break. I've been on consistently since launch and now have 4200 hours in game. I had no intention on taking a break any time soon. But , they broke all five of my characters in this one update. That fills me up to my bullshit limit instantly. I'll be back when they fix adrenaline. Maybe months from now, hopefully much sooner.
---
This. So much this.
---
The better question is - why is pve special limiting pvp special.
---
Should be separated.
---
Hi. We're actively investigating the issue with the Adrenaline Perk, I don't have details on timing for a fix right now but as soon as I do I will let you know!
---
I'm not saying the ammo converter isn't a trash fire, I'm just trying to make the current version useable until if/when they fix it.

TBH, two weeks strikes me as too short. Although I respect criticisms of the pass's grind, I think the point of it is to keep players occupied with trickle rewards for the next couple of months. If we could complete it in a short time then it would be purposeless and people would be clamouring for more, and it would be the same difference in the end. xD
---
I don't believe so. Only if they also got a hit in.
---
And we literally only have one .50 cal skin
---
Found out they won't reward you SCORE points because they aren't able to do it, like they aren't able to restore your character but sometimes they can.
---
Gotcha. So it'd be a 50% XP boost eating cranberry relish with the herbivore mutation?
---
I never get score for completing events
---
Fun gameplay? Fun new events? A goal to work towards that doesn't feel like a daily chore?
---
I think it is designed pretty well actually.  If a person is broke like me, they have the opportunity to grind and get all the rewards with a pretty good chance of success.  For those who can't make time, you have to pay atoms.  It is no different than if they just plopped all of these new rewards into the atom shop instead.   You'd have to pay or play.
---
Someone posted a calculator just now to compute your  chances of success.  It seems pretty good.   [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html)
---
Not to seem like a dick or stop anyone from making any sort of deal, but I feel you should know that the Explosive modifier nullifies Furious, atleast from what I've heard. Feel free to research a bit before spending too much on this prefix combo
---
Well to be fair the moaning is what got us wastlanders in the first place.
---
Also, I'm not English is the "of" in "could of sold it " a typo?
---
Was playing nuclear winter (had a group of friends into it) for a few hours. A second place win can get you almost 1500+ advenrure-mode XP in 20-30 minutes, depending on how many other XP things you do during the match
---
Hit several Mark's of the repeatable that way

 &gt; Hi. We're actively investigating the issue with the Adrenaline Perk, I don't have details on timing for a fix right now but as soon as I do I will let...
---
Nice location though!!!
---
It’s really the players that should control the economy imo. The ones that play it. They could just increase the cost of certain items that still leaves behind a grind. But in our own pace. 
---
They wouldn’t even have to bother. How great would that be. Win win.
---
Broken plants are visible while in build mode.
---
AWOL and heart of the swamp lots of xp and at least one legendary but barely anyone does them.
---
Awesome tool you’ve put together. 
---
I need to find tune the data I input to gauge how effective this can be. I put in guesstimated info and according to the calculator I’d be at rank 12 on day 7 but I’m already past rank 12 so I don’t think I input something correctly.
---
I hope that the Xbox game pass users won’t ruin it for Xbox and PC players
---
I remember coming across a player vendor once, he was only Lv. 30 or 40 I think, and he had the Responder Fireman Outfit for something like 20 caps or whatever the default price was.  I tried to tell him to hold onto it, because it was worth a ton, but they couldn't hear.
---
My main has one that I got from Collision Course.  It was just luck because I don't generally grind Responder events.
---
Thats what I want, new options to grind for score, not dailies. When i say grind i dont mean one thing to do over and over, i want multiple options not tied to dailies.
---
I know. I think players don't realise there are legendaries there or they'd be done quickly all the time.
---
What's an "R7 or 8"?
---
Please don't judge me, I'm not trying to troll. There's just so much to this game that I haven't discovered. I'm a level 50, and the very first event I ever participated in was Faschnat (sp?) last month. And that's only because I saw everyone on here talking about it, lol.
---
I am at the event just now no one has got any pylons and about 10 people are trying to shoot the imposter.
---
In an ideal world....
---
Was it somewhere other than the lighthouse? I thought that was the only spawn for a wise mothman and you can't harm him.
---
Would you rather endlessly complain
---
Kill all the low level stuff. I was running uranium fever last and and a guy did the come here emote whenever the legendary mole miner showed so everyone could tag and get their legendaries
---
Yes, I am, and it's stupid
---
Did you plant enough potatoes today for your precious wood armor camo that you'll never use? Lol
---
Xbox but damn, wish I could get one!!! (I’m lvl 160 but nonetheless this is awesome!)
---
Lol yes
---
Although it is currently bugged you need adrenaline and possibly gun Fu if you use vats. Both really good cards at stacking damage. If you want to keep using rifleman try and look out for or trade for an instigating lever. In stealth I can hit 2000 on headshots with it - really powerful. Commando is good also though - a good junkies fixer or handmade will set you straight. It's just hard finding these good weapons, especially with my luck! I'd recommend trying to learn the abbreviations and such so it's not as cryptic and get on the trading sub if you get anything good that doesn't suit your build to trade. Good luck.
---
Seems like another good option
---
I don't know.  If I team up with a buddy on a private server, we both get loot as long as we stay together.  Not sure about XP though.  Probably not.
---
Personally I wouldn't care if someone was doing this, but I prefer to get a few kills and leave some for the others.  It is kinda selfish to just run around one shotting everything when teamed.
---
Yeah and there are so many garbage legendaries to scrip
---
Prolazy tip: Don't use it until they fix it. XDDDDD
---
*Rewind to over three months ago...*
---
While I’m not sure if this bug (which I’ve seen as well) was prevalent 109 days ago, it’s not intended to work that way, and is essentially linked to lag. If it is ever fixed or mitigated, Instigating will be less useful on low damage high fire rate weapons. 
---
I can confirm that a Furious does work, but can also be affected by lag, since it depends on the damage effect being recognized. 
---
The same reason Instigating works better in lag is the same reason Furious works more poorly in lag; both are dependent upon the same type of condition checks, with one working better when the condition is positive (Furious) and the other working better when the condition is negative (Instigating).
---
I personally liked finding him doing weird shit, he seems like a broken man now sitting in that trailer
---
I just switch from Building to Events when finishing an Event. Best of both worlds!
---
This is a good call! I also moved my cursor well away from the horizonal lines made by the selection choices. Usually just threw it to the top right of the screen to make sure it didn't get made active accidentally.
---
I'll check them out once they fix adrenaline. I'm not turning the game back on until then.
---
But is there reliable way to get squirrel bits easily, like cranberries (100% chance to find multiple every time, for example Aaronholt homestead)? All I need to do is fast travel there and I can make 10 relish...
---
I mean a higher finishing placement in a Battle Royale still deserves a decent reward, after all you did survive longer than most, they can keep that. Just give a decent-sized increase to player kills.
---
Id like adrenaline to work
---
I don't mind at all.  Plus the chances for rare outfits make sure I hit up heart of the swamp and that stupid honey one ....irrational fear would be alot better if they toned down the stagger from bears a bit.
---
The problem is that there will always be that subset of PVPers who want to be able to force people to pvp. They will try to find ways to bait people, grief people etc. It is those people who garner the hate for pvp in general and it is those players who are causing the pver outcry that is catching Bethesdas attention and slowly driving pvp from the game.
---
I very much appreciate the turning a generic, small talk/appreciation reply into a full fledged marketing opportunity.
---
Luckily i have already 14k atoms saved up from my fo1 yearly sub... till now i didnt know where to spend them 😂
---
Does not really mean they have not abandoned the mode, they seem to be throwing a few crumbs only.
---
Work towards finishing daily/weekly tasks for new rewards. Just because YOU don't like something doesn't mean nobody likes it.
---
And dont forget to spend more money in Atomic Shop because you didnt kill Legendary Chicken at Bolton Greens while chewing Legendary Bubblegum at the sunset!
---
I'm glad that there are equivalent buttons for the consoles, too. Thanks for confirming.
---
Cross platform solidarity in muddling through awkward menus! Our pain is legion!
---
So easy to put a ton of repeatable weeklies like do some events, scrap tons of shit, kill Scorchbeast Queens, kill legendaries, kill robots, kill scorcheds, kill ANYTHING, help raiders/settlers, etc, etc, etc. BUT NOOOOO.
---
I'm level 10 after 2 days and all i've done is the weeklies and dailies and two queens.  Maybe 2-3 hours worth of play.
---
How much do you play the game?  If you weren't playing enough to do dailies before are you really losing anythign in this format?  A big chunk of dailies can be done in 10-15 min.  Plant crops, build something at camp, craft ammo, kill commie bots, chew gum, etc.
---
I don't play LoL, but a friend told me it's extremely toxic in Germany and also in France
---
I'm new as of wastelanders so I don't know that one- what does farming books get you? Cloth?
---
Yessir
---
If even one person-- one single person-- likes the seasons, then they are not objectively bad. And there are many more than that who have expressed support for it.
---
I recommend you check the dictionary before you start claiming something you personally dislike is objectively bad. Because you're misusing the word, trying to redefine it to strengthen your own opinion, and you weaken your own position by doing so. I've seen other people attempt the same thing by arguing that 76 is objectively bad... they do not understand the meaning of the word, and the more people attempt to abuse and manipulate it to make it seem like their personal opinion is some kind of external fact, the less connected to reality they are.
---
Also, concerning this: "the fact that you would STILL BE SHORT of completing the seasons chart even if you did all dailies/weeklies (if you don't do the repeatable) is pathetic". It's like you didn't even read my post. You will complete the repeatable naturally as you go, without having to specifically target it, and you will get enough score to fully complete the run just by doing the daily and weekly challenges.
---
I don't know how you managed to read and reply and not even get that simple basic foundation of the post lol.
---
adrenaline is broken.. my build is fucked.. I cant play
---
Thanks I had never seen this error before. So it just means someone is already in it? Crazy I've never run into that before....
---
I've come to terms with the fact that 76% of this subreddit is going to be people QQing about the game.
---
The community is very sweet to one another, But seem to be united by a collective enemy
---
Handmade skin hand glitch. OMFG how could they
---
Thanks I ended up going elsewhere for my XP. Seasons grind is real.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
Assuming this post isnt sarcastic then you might like this sub
---
I´d be down for the grand slam!
---
yeah.. thats not breaking builds...
---
I’m already a member there thankfully. Kind of balances this one out
---
Bethesda is notably silent on this, but those who have looked at the data have told me that there is no SCORE reward tied to completing Events, Public or otherwise.  Currently, they would only grant SCORE if there is a Daily/Weekly Challenge associated with them.
---
What they claimed on the seasons web page is:
---
&gt;In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events.
---
This isn't technically untrue.  There's nothing that really ties the XP to SCORE other than the Weekly Event that does it.  By that standard, saying it applies to Public Events is a weaselly statement, but not a false one.
---
We don't know if the XP repeatable will go away next week and be replaced with a Public Event one.  Or if the two were ever meant to co-exist.
---
completely borked.. fucking sucks
---
I find it funny tbh, but often what frustrating me, when you start conversation with him and he just stop talking for some reason and you need to TAB out of the conversation several time to complete his quest.
---
Wait, maybe you weren’t kidding. Your entire build relies on that one perk?
---
Now **THERE** is an idea. Go get a beer while a simple macro sells a stack of ammo. I wonder if any of the heroic modders will continue their noble pursuit of unfucking the UX mess and make something even easier?
---
The great community is in game giving free stuff to new accounts and doing back to back to back events in public groups. This sub is just where you'll find the whiners.
---
The great community is in the game enjoying themselves. Almost every sub-reddit for a video game is a bunch of people bitching around a fire.
---
damn dude, then why should you be the overseer of Vault 51? Apparently you don't have the genes to be a fitting overseer for us all... 
---
That's what my friend ZAX would say anyways.
---
Hi. Name's Billie Hatfield in game. I'll sell you scrip at 10 caps per scrip.  I have a bunch of junk weapons and armors, and they are priced so that their star ratings work out to 10 caps per scrip you can get from Mamma Mumbles. So 30, 90 and 240 for armors, 50, 150 and 400 for weapons.  And if you think you can get value of the weapon or armor instead of scripping it, have at it.
---
And I'm not the only person doing this either.
---
BGS has said that they will be introducing re-specing. I´m guessing it will have a cool down timer or will cost caps or gold buillion.
---
So is splitting hairs.
---
Be honest - if they were rewarding SCORE with Public Events, you wouldn't be saying "That's not what they claimed it would do!"
---
Load Bearing - you can get 100+ Copper Ore with Excavator Armor
---
They really need to fix that, quickly.
---
I don't really enjoy season pass systems myself, I've ignored them in a few games.
---
That said, I'm seeing more posts from experienced players suggesting it's a lot easier to grind XP score than it seems at first. If you don't permanently leave the game you could always take a peek at some of those and see how much you could grind if that's your thing.
---
Bethesda are like responsible hunters. They use all parts of the Ghillie texture. Nothing goes to waste.
---
NW is the best AFK XP generator ever.
---
Pretty sure this sub is used to campaign for changes to the game, so basically brigaded. If there's a complaint, it will be parroted fifty thousand times. This makes it seem like there's more hate, but it's actually just more vocal
---
R is rank. There are 100 ranks. Rank 5 nets you the converter.
---
For a full reward list see:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons)
---
Thanks for this explanation. I was trying to figure out this earlier this morning. 
---
I can't decide if this a hit or a miss on the system. 
---
On the one hand, if everyone had like 5 points charisma and could share any card it would probably be crazy overpowered
---
but on the other hand, cards don't stack (so far as we know) so generally you're only sharing meh cards?
---
As of right now if you completed all dailies and weeklies (minus 7/2 dailies) Your rank should be 11
---
I had written 'conveniently', meaning it shouldn't be easy but should be possible. Getting 100% of something in a game generally requires a certain amount of effort/commitment/skill, which I would not call convenient.
---
I explained this a bit more in another reply.
---
Nope, i wouldn't. I would be happy and enjoy the increased amount of score we could get. Why would i complain about something positive? You are not making any sense.
---
*"We sure do have some dedicated players!"* \-Bethesda probably.
---
So should we not trust your FAQs now? Their entire point is to provide us with accurate answers to questions we might have, if even your best clarification attempts are subject to errors (for whatever reason, them not being vetted or whatever) then you're only teaching us that we shouldn't take you at your word.
---
Get your shit in order, BGS Austin. There needs to be some basic level of competence we can trust you with.
---
Its pretty rude but depends on the circumstances. I use my VE handmade to get splash damage and then pull whatever I can towards the group. Line in the sand and Heart of the enemy for example I'll do this.  
---
If they don't seem to worried about it or are off controller a region of the play area then i'll start blasting them away.
---
Yeah? Well.....how do you become friends with ZAX anyway?
---
Once you reach 100, what does it really matter?
---
Awesome, thank you. I got stuck in that thing seems like 15 minutes I couldn’t find the fucking exit
---
They removed the ability to share perks with charisma buffs at the launch of Wastelanders which still annoys me. 15 charisma doesn’t make for the best build but it’s the only way to share max cards
---
It’s the Twilight Zone of terminals
---
Or even MAMA Mumbles tokens you could find in the ash heap.  Make load bearing and breach and clear worth while.  If your in the mire that 50 caps(I actually never am hurting for caps so I dont care) to fast travel for some junk and scrap.  If there was a chance in 3* lock boxes and events the ash heap would actually be worth dragging my ass to.
---
It annoying for us because we have so much ammo but for new player doing it each day it isn’t that bad.. 
---
So just do it daily with the new ammo you loot only.. the old stuff sell it off
---
i dont run bloodied/junkie..
---
Mine just automatically goes back to the ammo I was converting, so I can just spam A over and over as fast as possible, until I've put in as many rounds of that type it will take.
---
Took me about 5 minutes to run all my old ammo thru and get like 5k .50 cal
---
Just ran the calculator, level 31 plan to get 20,000 xp a day without nuclear winter and i come up short by three levels.
---
That would mean buying three levels for 450 atoms all told.
---
We are going to be getting way more than that over the course of the run plus most people have got a few atoms kicking around spare at the moment anyway.
---
This is going to be more than doable.
---
i have a gauss shotgun with extra limb damage and enforcer 3. On something like line in the sand i'll aim at groups of enemies and just try and slow them. Then After a few seconds i'll start picking them off as they get closer.
---
Well. basically same with most events. I'll try and NOT kill them with one shot but sometimes it's hard. The number of times i've one shot the blood eagle captain in riding shotgun by accident.. oops
---
Ok cool, thank you, I appreciate it!
---
The best place to get legendaries would be 
---
💵💵💵
---
my camp vendor with it’s excellent deals and reasonable prices, marketed towards all builds! 💵💵💵
---
&gt;If even one person-- one single person-- likes the seasons, then they are not objectively bad.
---
Lmao, if one person likes something that is objectively bad for them since it's in the company's favor and not the player's favor, and you ignore/failed to counter the explanation behind what the entire point of seasons is, then it's your own fault that your argument fails.
---
I reccomend you quit hiding behind the "subjective" argument in some desperate attempt to defend 76 and how bad seasons is for players, many before you have already tried and failed to shill for a game that is objectively a mess.
---
There's no subjectivity about how objectively bad something is, no matter how much you use mental gymnastics to try and uphpld a game that failed in every way.  Nice try though, lol.
---
did you ONLY kill 5 liberators? Because it's not kill 5 robots. it's 5 kinds of robots. hovering over the challenge will give you the perimeters. you need to kill like 5 protectrons, 5 turrets, an assaultron, 5 eyebots, etc.
---
same for the CAMP challenge. you have to do all the things listed not just build stairs. there's building containers, floor items, and such.
---
I haven’t seen people talking about dupes recently?
---
After ES6 which comes after Starfield so in 3 to 5 years is my guess.
---
Hmm, I counted 99 levels, not 100. I'm not sure why you think otherwise. :O  I've had a bunch of people comparing numbers in this thread and the two that always come up are, rounded down just a touch, 220k and 223k. 
---
I'm also not sure what exactly you mean by 'assuming 10 weeks'. I used math to show that if you grind 21,500 score per day, in 10 weeks you should have fully cleared the run (215,000k earned and the extra 5-8k would have been gained from the XP score that comes naturally).
---
That said, some people are reporting that they're already grinding over 1k extre score in a single session, just from XP. So if they're right then it could be a lot shorter than it seems. Time will tell.
---
You forgot the WHAM, BAM, ALAKAZAAM!
---
I have a full unyeilding set so i can see why they decided to prevent us from. Sharing perks that way.
---
But I think the charisma buff from the charisma team should allow you to share perks. Otherwise what is the point in that team over say the hunting or events team?
---
They can. Use the stair pillars and attach to the top level. The new stairwell can snap onto it. This is only good for stationary camps
---
Are you on ps4 by any chance?
---
No problem.
---
Could you post the link to your settings?
---
Yeah, its a part of crafting gunpowder to make ammo. You get cloth resource from scrapping books.
---
Its slightly intentional, when wastelanders came out they made it so only your base charisma counts towards what perk cards you could share and it doesn't take into account unyielding, food bonuses etc. It was to mitigate a glitch with shared perk cards would unshare because of fluctuating charisma stats and if someone DC'd. I get what you're saying with the kinda dumb bonus not being all that useful in the grand scheme of things
---
I'm the opposite, yaaaaaaay kids exploding forever.
---
Yeah.  I think this is my final straw.  Been in since Fallout 1, and was here for launch day, but I'm done.
---
What is your build. This isn’t even related to the above conversation, just kind of curious really
---
Bloodied took over after the nerfed tse it's still pretty good but they broke the adrenaline perk, other than that heavy is good against the queen
---
Yes on No.3- lots of good stuff available but only when the player is online.
---
I'm afraid he's right.  Personal opinion is subjective. Math is not. So when you say "If even one person-- one single person-- likes the seasons, then they are not objectively bad", then you are applying a subjective measure to determine objective truth. In other words, you are objectively wrong.  
---
To put it simply: people can like things that are bad. That doesn't keep those things from being bad.
---
Haha. Thanks.
---
What's the max INT (for exp) ?
---
🤣🤣🤣, so true
---
Killing the 5 Liberators was the last sub-challenged I had to finish.
---
Also the UI literally tells me I have that weekly challenge done. Something is fucked up. Just to be sure, later on I finished the other sub challenges as well, 0 SCORE awarded.
---
Doesnt explain the missing SCORE from the doors/stairs weekly either.
---
Ah sorry, PC player here.
---
That would also be nice.
---
I think it probably is unrealistic for a lot of players. But then, most progression systems in games I've played are not fully cleared by the whole playerbase. People seem to forget that expecting to get everything from a game isn't really how games work, hehe.
---
Anyway, we'll see how hard it is soon enough, people are posting up their grind experiences already.
---
Tell that to the guy who was selling 25 legacies &amp; b2525 fixers are 😇
---
When you are talking about people being able to complete something, it is clearly a discussion within the rules. 
---
Obviously cheating cheaters are going to get there faster 
---
Doesn't mean shit for the 99% of players who don't use exploits
---
3 hits?! Hacker!
---
They can. But not naturally. Use pillars. Stack and remove pillar. 
---
Also you probably gonna have to remove the walls before.
---
I don’t think they actually fixed this and made him stay at his station. I found him enjoying the music last night and he was walking around before that when I started my daily quest.
---
So should we not trust your FAQs now? Their entire point is to provide us with accurate answers to questions we might have, if even your best clarification attempts are subject to errors (for whatever reason, them not being vetted or whatever) then you're only teaching us that we shouldn't ever take you at your word.
---
Straight up even I’m tempted to buy something from them
---
It should definitely be there, check under Display. If you can't see it at all, you may need to run a game repair, as it may not have patched in right. :/
---
I run a heavy build and its game changing when you get mobbed.  Been mostly playing on an alt till they get it fixed.  Very underrated card if your a full health kinda guy/gal.
---
The ultimate display of patience, hah!
---
Wanna know this too!
---
Hmmm....I must have input something wrong the first time. When I went back to it and entered my info again it changed. It says after 7 days I’ll be at rank 30. That seems more the pace I’ll be going after playing for 2 days.
---
Go bloodied if you want ez mode. or junkies if you want slightly less ez mode.
---
I’m just surprised that is has such an impact it makes the game unplayable.
---
There definitely is/are dupe methods being used right now. I’ve talked to people in the “inner circle” that get shipments of 20k stable flux at a time and B2525 fixers are being duped though not widely distributed like old dupe methods.
---
This is all just my word though so believe me or don’t. I don’t care either way lol.
---
There really isn’t. If you don’t have unyielding or random chems to boost your charisma then sure you can get those few dialogue options or lower the price on vendors. For constant use though, not really. I think there is some effect with how much you can get from a public event but I’m not certain on that
---
Every release is *kind of* broken and then they *kind of* fix it later. Bethesda modus operandi.
---
The issue I have is math when bad math is being used to support an argument. Misusing or fabricating facts is never OK.
---
As to the change to challenges, it's clearly liked and disliked by many people. I'm more on the dislike side, but I didn't like the atom grind either, it was even more boring with those terrible take a picture type challenges (all removed now), and most of the time the cash shop didn't have anything new I wanted. So I'm really not in a fit over this. *shrug*
---
That’s an unfair judgement.  Considering Obsidian started with only assets from fallout 3 to, and only a year to finish the game.  They did pretty well and if they had more time from Bethesda it would have been better.
---
I believe it ramps up to 1000 and then stays there so each level requires 1000.
---
No sorry, it's 25% with herbivore. It was 10% before the changes to the herbivore mutation.
---
I think if you nuke Morgantown? You get more cobalt flux as there are more wild plants for it there to spawn, different areas have different amounts of different flux
---
This is a big part of why I just keep bugging for shared XP for Teams (within a reasonable distance), ideally with the same mechanics carrying over automatically to everyone in an Event... I think we'd see more players more willing to focus on playing the objectives if they didn't have to worry about missing out on loot or XP just because someone else ran in and one-shotted it before they could get a hit in.
---
&gt;It is no different than if they just plopped all of these new rewards into the atom shop instead.
---
It's very different, indeed. It would only be the same if my priorities in getting all those rewards matched the order in which they are presented on the SCORE board. I am reasonably sure that this is not the case for roughly 100% of the player base. I really only want a few specific things; a lot of other stuff is in the "oh, I'll take it since it's there for the taking"; and then there is quite a bit of stuff in the "I'll never ever use this" category.
---
If I earned all the ATOMs that I would have gotten via the old method and Bethesda added all that stuff to the ATOM shop at prices that are consistent with what they've done in the past, I would be able to get all the things I want and some of the nice-to-have things as well and still have some ATOMs left over. As it is, there are things that I want but will very likely not get unless I pay more than the 1500 ATOMs that I could theoretically get during this season.
---
hmm what's your current SCORE? if you added the points you'd get for weekly and dailies, do they match the amount of SCORE needed to get to the rank you have?
---
My gathering building supplies isn't counting I grabbed like 5 bags of fertiliser scrapped them and got nothing somethings are buggy in it for sure hopefully they will hotfix it 🤔
---
Bloodied for commando unyielding, junkie for heavy power armor.
---
There was a dupe method but it go hotfixed without any downtime.  It is no longer active as of this time.
---
Most adults are also not ocd collectors and can control their purchasing
---
14000 exp if I recall correctly. 
---
If you hide in bushes you can get about 100-200 exp per match/10minutes.
---
If you can win you get closer to 1000 or more exp. 
---
Takes a little bit, depending on how quickly they patch this it's doable though.
---
I'm not saying unplayable ..just less enjoyable.  My internet amigo there is right to be very upset....I will continue playing because two headed Bessie needs chicken friends.
---
I would consider 'math' a slang usage. And there's no need for correct grammar when what's presented has clear meaning. ;)
---
Completely intuitive alright...
---
Yeah i just checked in the pip boy what it says about charisma. Basicly it lets you share perks, gain more caps when a team mate completes a quest and makes robot vendor prices better.
---
Ok , thank you for the info
---
The ammo converter is just F'd... It feels easier to hunt down the components and craft the stuff (maybe that was the point?)
---
Too many options on the damn thing. Ideally I would be able to just bulk dump in unwanted ammo, select the kind of output I want, and walk away. It should then just run with a best effort attempt to convert to my desired ammo type. If my input doesn't match my desired chosen output then just let it sit there. I don't need a half dozen terminal screens of nonsense to do this. Just one optional help screen to explain what converts to what and be done with it.
---
Because single shot rifleman like me would be overflowing with bullets more so than we already are.
---
 Those are the only 2 calibers I use and I have tens of thousands of both  because I only shoot one bullet at a time.
---
newly minted sneaky vats crit rifleman just hit lvl 53 before the patch
---
for dealing with swarms of mobs (aka almost every scenario youre fighting mobs) I absolutely need the adrenaline
---
sneaky head shots and crits are good but once sneak breaks.. like it often does in a place like whitesprings.. I am hanging out high and dry..
---
yes im aware of gun-fu and I rely on that heavily also.. but I dont have it on this toon yet because I chose to get my adrenaline first
---
I can play the game.. but its like being lvl 14 again.. I cant go to the east and generate the kind of numbers needed to not get my ass kicked..
---
if it was a commando it probably wouldnt be so bad...
---
A couple weeks maybe a month (for me at least) the xp output on NW is wildly low imo (I was grinding nw while double xp and even at that it was hella low return) I’m getting there but I’m lazy and not good at nw enough to pursue it
---
Have you been having a problem of not being able to mine a node in Ea
---
Yea I had crops just to say I actually planted something but then they get destroyed and I have no way to repair them.  Why in the hell would you repair a crop rather than fertilize it to get it grow back?
---
There should definitely be more xp awarded for kills.
---
Every once in a while.
---
In my experience, other games do have this same kind of grind (not all of course, it seems like a mixed bag to me). The timegating I saw in WoW Legion wasn't very forgiving if you wanted to get all the goodies.
---
That said, I agree it can be demoralizing, and I hope they add catch-up mechanics (like the double XP event).
---
They are duping for almost a month now. B2525 handmades/fixers are like caps currently.
---
It’s just silly in a apocalyptic setting. I can bunny hop and grenade others too, but it just takes the immersion away. I don’t play NW much because of the wait time and complete reliance on luck.
---
That makes sense then. I run commando with adrenaline at 5 and honestly didn’t even notice it wasn’t working until I saw the posts here.
---
Do you have a link to your build by any chance? Curious to know what else you are running
---
What? Communication??? :D
---
Not long if you actually play. The more you play the better you’ll get. I used to camp constantly. Do that and it’ll take all day if not longer.
---
Okay I guess the whole LoL community is then, some friends of mine play LoL and the more casual ones say you can't do one thing wrong and the rest of your team goes down at you with claw and teeth
---
If you play the game you will find out🤦🏼‍♂️
---
Well when you see bunch of youtubers brag how they can one shot everything and five-shot the queen, it’s byebye time for that weapon.
---
Charisma gives a bonus to XP and Cap rewards when completing quests, that’s the logic to it being under “Roleplaying” your doing quests as a group and all get a better reward (5% per +1 CHA)
---
It’s probably better for lower level characters who are focusing on doing storyline quests as a group.
---
It seems Everytime I do the event I can't harvest the copper or aluminum
---
I noticed there's a wendigo collossus skin rug in the build tab and now I don't really want to see one!
---
I’m looking for it in the shop but can’t find it, no need to be an asshole
---
The first time i encountered the vengeful mothman was when i had just finished killing a bunch of cultists at a random shrine in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night. I walked up to loot and there he was, staring at me over the corpses of his followers.
---
"So i guess im going to die now" i thought. But I put one round into him and he just flew off.
---
The second time i found him (vengeful) was sitting on a hill across the street from the Wayward. He was just there chilling. I shot him that time too but he just flew off again.
---
Pointless to do so, I have gotten far too many XP and thus SCORE from it to ever be able to deduce how much I should have.
---
I'm pretty sure I know what you mean about the charging issue, but would you mind expanding on that?
---
I'm overstocked on junk to scrip. But theres a ridiculously low daily limit.
---
It's mostly in the game that the community excels. However, positive posts don't make a community great. 
---
If the game wasn't in such a poor state so often, there would likely be a very different tone in this sub. Much like around the time when the first DLC dropped which was received fairly positively.
---
Those days are long behind us.
---
If I want to complete the season pass I do. And I think it’s ridiculous that I do especially as a lot of the olayerbase isn’t a fan of pvp it’s ridiculous bethesda keeps expecting them to play it.  And there is more to the game than just nuking it. And there is a lot ofhe game that doesn’t require run and gun. You do realize there are stealth builds. I don’t enjoy the events that have a lot of high level mobs rushing you true. But that’s not the only part of the game. Not even close. It’s just a few events.
---
Exactly. An hour a day is more than enough to get to the end of the board in 10 weeks.
---
Yeah, I can see this.  I use a headset, but a buddy uses the speakers and mic on his laptop - so I hear his game, his wife, and every key stroke.  I find it annoying but I enjoy his company.  I can imagine others just wouldn’t find it worthwhile.  
---
I’m on PC, play evenings mostly, always looking for new friends.  ShinyKittySurprise
---
You have my sincere sympathy.
---
Did both of these as well, marked as finished, and have gotten nothing for either of them. It's so disappointing.
---
Yup. It is slang. I'm not correcting grammar. I'm correcting english. If I was bothered about grammar. I would be using commas and not full stops,
---
Don’t do the instruments, just use that jukebox machine to play music and wait for the ghouls. If everyone goes out and wait for the ghouls and wendigo, follow the crowd. Also use a shotty or something explosive so you always land a hit on anything that pops up.
---
I’m adding that to the main text of the post and coining it lol
---
He's trying to earn the rewards too!
---
I know this is old, but in case you haven't done so try installing MSI AfterBurner and set your GPU fan profile to ramp up the fan speed at a lower temp. I wear headphones so don't notice the fans screaming but it helps with temp.
---

---
Yeaaaa .. inner circle and shipments.. sounds like a whole underground conspiracy gangster club thingy.

Where you go to a suspicious looking thug in a dark ally to buy a backpack with a teddy bear on it..

This would also be a step in the right direction.

.50 cal macine guns spews rounds like crazy

Also 5mm, yes u craft 180 a time, but a minigun holds 500/mag, while u craft 36 5.56 per craft while a HM holds 25 rounds a mag
---
what does "progression within the level" mean?
---
[pretty much this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2l10pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0an0ar0p00cu0sv0sb0lu0lk1&amp;w=p80p90c52ij2i42iq2pa0lm0at0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0&amp;m=8c5&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d)

---
This is so wholesome

u/uwuwizard
---
Not so much. There's always some around the front of the Whitespring and butcher's bounty helps. Else it's a case of server hopping a critter spawn until you get them.
---
The game is almost never unplayable, but it can very easily become unenjoyable. This game lacks serious balance, so some things, like adrenaline, can help balance that out. When you’re low level and take an entire clip to kill one enemy, that’s not fun. 
---
My first build at level 200 still took entire ammo clips to kill 1 enemy. Sure I was built better for melee, but it should never be that bad. The difference between full health damage, and low health damage, even with all perks, is insane and very noticeable. 
---
I recently respecced a rifle character into a heavy weapons suppressor build. It does very little damage comparatively and that’s while being bloodied for Adrenal Reaction. I still use my BE Handmade and it will take an average of 3-5 shots instead of a one shot each time. The suppressors weapons themselves do much less damage despite being max specced and bloodied through Adrenal. That just doesn’t feel enjoyable when you could do things super smooth and efficiently before. So while losing adrenaline isn’t exactly game breaking, losing 60% damage boosts is definitely enough to be noticeable and dampen the fun factor
---
&gt;Stay frosty BGS and do not let your guard down!!
---
I appreciate your positivity but then again the Ammo Converter made it past QA and was approved for release in the state that it was in, so...
---
People exploiting to L100 board completion already.
---
Taking bets on whether or not Bethesda does anything about it. Any takers?
---
Didnt think so.
---
I’ve done 8 dailies this morning but my counter is stuck at 4/5
---
Every 10000 xp equals 100 score
---
I wouldn’t mind if the reward was extra that helped you progress quicker. But it’s ridiculous it is required. And sorry, but saying I can grind 25000 extra do ti make up for it (on top of the 10k XX you already have to do) really isn’t an excuse. Yeah, some people get that xp quickly. Some people don’t (when your build requires a lot of patience as it is a stealth build xp does not build quickly at all. I played the game a lot longer than I usually do yesterday and still only managed 25000 so total. And I have a lot of time on my hands these days but I don’t want to spend all my day playing fallout.
---
I got the robot SCORE when i had 3/5.
---
It doesnt leave you short as you say, only 5000 xp short. Which you can get back by getting the repeatable 1 per day during 70 days. Lets say you couldnt do 2 dailies that are usually 250 xp, you need you get the repeatable 100 xp 5 times to compensate. Lets say that you get the repeatable 5 times every day 500 xp, 500 x 7 is 3500 that is almost half that you would be short in the end and we are only talking about first week because we know what kind of repeatable we are getting. Lets say next week is different but more farmable. And you do it 5 times, 500x70 is 35000 xp on top of the total xp you get from doing every daily weekly, etc. Plus probs we'll get meatweek soon, probs a double xp event or something else to it. Then in the last 10 levels when it becomes a hell of a grind, over 3000 xp, you just buy them for 150x10 is 1500 which is not even much for some. You care about atoms then do more grind but this shit is a feasible grind.
---
Why is  'math' the point when someone is judging a gameplay system and describing it as bad according to personalized criteria?
---
The poster is pushing their opinion of the system, not simply describing it. That kind of opinion isn't about 'math', nor is it objective.
---
As far as the part you quoted, I wasn't applying a subjective measure to determine an objective truth. I was pointing out that objective evalation of how good a piece of entertainment is is simply not possible. It can only be subjectively evaluated unless you're trying to determine the functionality of something (so you could say that a game objectively does not work if it won't boot up, for example). So yes, when you're comparing personal preferences for things, only subjective outcomes are possible; calling an opinion a fact doesn't make it so, it just makes you someone who doesn't understand the nature of objectivity and subjectivity.
---
Any person who describes a piece of entertainment as 'objectively bad' is misusing the concept to try to validate and strengthen their own subjective position.
---
It depends heavily on what is available on the server. When I created "builder teams" sometimes nobody joins or only low level players. So now I just pick a team with high level players. These usually have mutations triggering "Strange in Numbers", which gives me +2 INT for egg head (+8 in total) and +1  INT for herd mentality (+3 in total) ... so +3 INT from that alone. Also I think "Inspirational" only works, if there is at least one other player in your team. So unless you get a (full or mutated) "builder team", the more common "event teams" are ofter better on the XP side.
---
The lack of self awareness in this post... 
---
Wow.
---
I always felt like junkies was more easy. The drawbacks from withdrawal are so little.
---
:(
---
it's up the river by Site Alpha, if i recall. i think along one of the feeder streams
---
The only people who will spend cash to finish off the season are ones that can’t deal with FOMO or were too lazy and planned on whaling it anyways. 
---
The ones who won’t spend cash but can’t deal with FOMO are the ones that will complain endlessly because they feel entitled to the top tier rewards even though they are only playing a couple of hours a week.
---
My very first and last LoL match my team absolutely ripped me apart calling me all sorts of shit and made me feel like utter garbage even though they could clearly see I had just started. I finished the match and uninstalled immediately.
---
And how is that worse than already having to buy bundles of things that I don't want, just to get the one thing that interests me?  Your logic is swayed by your personal wishes. We all wish that we wouldn't have to jump through hoops to get the good stuff, but truthfully the harder that an item is to obtain, the more desirable it becomes.
---
Technically you’re not supposed to overtake him. Someone made a map of if you did every daily and weekly without fail, INCLUDING NW, you would finish at 100 on the final day. My own numbers come close to that. If you’re not playing hard daily, you won’t overtake him. You’ll be lucky to meet him at level 100
---
If ya ain't bitchin' about something ya ain't playing the game right /s
---
I was just telling my friend most of my problems are in the finer details with the limits on things and in the endgame. The gameplay is still fun. I still thoroughly enjoy blowing things up with my explosive handmade and playing dress up in the wasteland. 
---
If folks aren't at *least* enjoying the gameplay loop it may be time to move on cause that's unlikely to change.
---
but isnt that how Vault-Tec operate? see what you can get away with and then backtrack on the stuff you cant
---
Might try it out, but i’m sure i’ll get bored again after about an hour or two.

Damn where can I find one?? lol
---
Thats where an alternate charecter comes in handy.
---
Each character has their own NW lvl even though rewards are account wide.
---
how the hell am I not supposed to complain about adrenaline being broken?
---
Ohh alright. Now I gotcha.
---
the feature (teams) that was on the PTS is great, while the feature that wasn't on the PTS is a mess. 
---
who could have ever seen this coming
---
hey now,
---
sometimes they comment on posts about peoples' camps!
---
You must be new here, and i mean by the perspective that bethesda is gonna fix it.
---
That sounds just like something a duper would say 🤔😄
---
Is it still available? I thought it was limited time only
---
what we really need is a new form of currency that can not be traded and has a very tight limit on how much you can earn each day, spend each day and keep total ! 
---
this will fix everything we don't have enough restrictions on how much we can play and we don't have enough different currencies
---
Ok, at this point, enough is enough, calm down, it’s been two days, and it’s not even the weekend yet, plenty of players haven’t played yet, they’re probably just waiting for the other half of the community that can’t play during the week. Be patient.
---
make sure you get addictions that don't effect your main specials (or too much)
---
I run junkies gauss and psycho addiction give -10 DR and -1 str. BUT i don't really miss that 1 str as it's such a powerful gun as it is. Things that effect luck, int and chr are fine. 
---
Daytripper gives -1 chr and - 1 lck
---
mentats gives -1 cr 
---
so i'd go with those 2 and psycho. 
---
Oh and Alcohol gives -1 agi and -1 chr. Don't know if you would miss 1 agi or not.
---
that guys a real one
---
Your 'explanation' was an opinion. That's all it is. But you want to treat it like it's objective, and that can't be argued with, so you've set yourself up to win by default without even having to make a good argument.
---
It's sad. You talk about mental gymnastics but you haven't even figured out how art and entertainment work. You're caught up in the idea that these things can be more than subjective, that you can personally like or dislike something so much that it's just inherently bad. 
---
Please continue to educate yourself on these topics, because few people will want to engage with such narcissism.
---
Dont know tbh
---
No worries :-]
---
Oh i misunderstood then, because that is the true problem. I apologize.
---
Yes, there's currently an issue with the Adrenaline Perk. We're investigating!
---
Dunno, mine is 41 and I still benefit.  I don't believe there is a cap other than the max int of 100
---
I can give you one, im looking for a b3325 lmg
---
Ducked all the way up.

Hi, we're aware of these issues with the Screaming Eagle Skin and we're working on fixes for a future update.

bloodied does WAY more damage so.. i think it kinda wins.

You might be out of luck, sorry to say. They ended back with Fasnacht IIRC
---
See now this is why we need player made guilds/factions in this game. I would love to drop a couple dozen stimpacks/rad aways/ammo in a shared community chest to donate to a cause like this. 
---
Great job with the post I lold and felt inspired
---
I edited the description of the post so it makes more sense 👍
---
oh ya once you have spend months hiding in bushes (or under water) to get to lvl 100 then it doesn't matter. but im sorry to let you know there is a very large amount of the community that haven't gotten to lvl 100 yet.
---
I rather fast travel from Crater to Foundation to use the gold press then to go inside and use the crater gold press.
---
All the weekly challenges I've done so far have given me the reward when I was only half way through the challenge. It's possible you already got the score from it.
---
For a commando type build these addictions are the ones I run with:  Alcohol, Buffout, Fury, Mentats and Psycho.
---
I run these on my junkies heavy gunner:  Alcohol, Daddy-O, Day Tripper, Mentats and Psycho 
---
I would seek out a decent junkies weapon, before making the jump into addictions.
---
I thought Bethesda added a new atom shop kit and I got angry for a sec
---
That's the vibes I get as well, pretty obnoxious for a video game but the weirdest shit makes people happy lol.
---
They could technically use gold for that since Crater and Foundation both want it. Not including every one else.
---
I'm thinking a they are stockpiling our caps as a "back  up" plan in case the gold based currency doesn't "pan out". Pun intended.
---
Okay. Thanks for the info. 👍✌️
---
I played Rust before this.  What a difference.
---
A point about use of plural would be a point about English grammar though, hehe.
---
It's not a big deal anyway.
---
Yeah, that sounds boring as hell. Like for example, in Fallout 4 when I finished all the quests and explored everything in the game, I just  stopped playing. I think grind for mobs and legendary items is jut not for me. OG Fallout wasn’t about stupid grind. I bought the game soley to explore the map and finish the quests solo, but 150 hours just felt a bit too few.
---
apparently the developers do. which shows that they don't know how to play their game
---
The game itself isn't the community that keeps new players away
---
I’ve gotten score from events, it might just be participation based, so people don’t just afk at events. It could also be that not every event gives score.
---
EA would like to have a word with you.
---
It depends heavily on what is available on the server. When I created  "builder teams" sometimes nobody joins or only low level players. So now  I just pick a team with high level players.

So unless you get a  (full or mutated) "builder team", the more common "event teams" are  ofter better on the XP side.
---
XP is much better wearing unyielding for bloodied also
---
Grind it out, it's a ton of boring work, that's why they are so expensive. I have one and I'm not parting with it unless its something that takes as long to grind. Once you get going it's not to hard, just takes commitment.
---
Have you tried grinding for just one, let alone a spare? You're better off with a faction rep mod anyway.
---
If the inner circle wants to drop a duped B2525 near my toon I wouldn't complain.
---
they don't like grinding either, the grind is why they want so much for them. They are looking for something to make it worth the time and effort. before calling them greedy, maybe take a long hard look in the mirror.
---
Not 100% true you need to do the weekly repeatable about 1/day or 4/day without N.W. challenge to stay on curve. This is all based on the assumption that the 25 increase each rank stays linear.
---
Today, day 2 of the season, assuming you already did the weeklies, you should be at rank 10 minimum to be on the curve, otherwise you are ahead/behind.
---
There were several posts that had bad math, though. So not sure if that's right. Is that accounting for all of the extra XP repeatable score points?
---
Those traders are smart. They know how much time and effort is required to earn those plans. 
---
Why in the world would they trade for caps, which are effectively worthless, especially for high end trading, or for junk that they likely have too much of.
---
If you find these people too greedy, that's fair enough. You can just earn the badges to get your own plan. Problem solved!
---
Did you even read the post my guy? Why would Bethesda need to wait until more players play the game to clear up whether or not we are supposed to get SCORE from public events? That’s literally all I want, better communication. The CMs responded immediately to complaints about the Screaming Eagle skin, but half the other posts were people questioning if Public Events award SCORE?
---
i had the same Bug , and the Same answer by bethesda support . and the Button to make a Feedback doesn't work becasue of maintenance ... nice   
---
 "**Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to edit S.C.O.R.E."**   
---
so we never can get the Rank 100 since we had lost SCORE for nothing ... for me i lost more then 3000 because my Weekly challenge are also complete ... with no reward
---
I had it unlocked but it was never available on my emote wheel.
---
To be honest, it just sounds like you're bored of the game at this point, which is ok, just play something else!
---
Technically it's 'mostly' a bunch of wannabe developers as I at least do actually have a certificate with Software Development emblazoned on it.
---
Lol. Touche monseiur. It's no big deal at all. I was bored.
---
Hahaha that’s hilarious! Literally the most entitled post I’ve read in a long time. Earn the plan man. It’s one you can knock out challenges to get. The challenges suck, but how do you think the person selling you the plan got it? Let alone a spare plan! Takes a lot of grinding and “a few thousand caps” ain’t worth the many many hours it takes to get that plan.
---
The dailies and weeklies aren’t necessarily bad if they divorced them from being dailies and weeklies and just over the 10 weeks more “goals” unlocked.  So someone who can’t play everyday could potentially catch-up when they play a lot on the weekend say.
---
I do think they also need to add more ways to get SCORE, from events and add new events would be ideal since there’s variety in that at least
---
You can look at your XP bar ingame and see how far you are in. It has some effect on how your XP and leveling up will progress. The higher level you are the more XP is necessary towards the next level.
---
Lmao I know right. The pursuit of a B25 fixer is how I found the guy, ended up trading for what I believe to be a legitimate B25 fixer with faster movement speed.
---
Answer is clearly no then.
---
They used to sell for 25k - 40k so even when they are much more available they should still be worth something. The plans used to sell for 5k per badge needed. Sucks the market on them got destroyed as well since I have 25 badges saved up for the day they might have value again.
---
Funny how I was able to get the fixer plan just by trading some guy a bunch of junk I had but yet I see people asking for legacy weapons for it. That plan ain’t worth shit cause I see it for sale all the time and people usually have more than 1
---
I've done it eight times in two play sessions
---
Agreed, it will only change if gamers express their feelings not with boycotts, petitions, review bombs or social media rants but by simply not buying this crap. When it hurts revenue streams, publishers will respond as that’s all they understand - these companies comprise of fantastically talented developers who are unfortunately led by individuals who do not understand their products or their customers and from a generation that grew up thinking gaming was a nerdy geeky thing confined to teenage bedrooms and arcades - to them, it’s just about numbers.
---
the awful part is, after season 1 finishes, I wouldnt be surprised if Season 2 starts shortly after, and the grind is going to be just as bad. 
---
This is probably the best way for Bethesda to burn out the people who actually like this game and make them not want to comeback for a while
---
Oh man I just noticed hes on the second chapter already! Idk if that has any relevance but according to the math and assuming the linear rank progress stays consistent, as well as the daily/weekly challenges which appear to be. You are looking at being Rank 10 to stay at pace today, (day 2 of season) Day 3 you'll want to be Rank 13 or higher to keep up so do the repeatable as much as you can once your weekly/daily challenges are done.
---
Last few times I played it not one legendary spawned. I think they messed with it to make it less likely to get legendaries.
---
I agree, people are being stupid in assuming that ever score reward will be the same? Maybe next week they give us 2000 for killing the queen, or in general just up the ante with rewards?
---
Exactly. I crafted myself Herd mentality and Empath after watching Angry turtle’s explanation on the mutations.
---
Some guy posted a screenshot and he had like 58 intelligence or something. 
---
Hmmm!
---
I don't remember anything about legendary perks supposedly coming out last summer.
---
Just the introduction to NW, which was postponed.
---
I remember them being talked about and hinted at, but not an actual time frame for release.
---
Seeing the comments about the legendary perks not showing any changes, I'm hoping you're right, actually - *hopefully* most of this video had been made up in advance, as a "here's everything for summer, available now!" video, but then just tweaked to "here's everything coming *throughout* the summer!" after they pushed legendary perks and the boss fight back.
---
I totally agree and bugs should be reported constantly. I guess my perspective on this is slightly different since I played No Man's Sky for years after launch and we just learned to play around the initial unfulfilled promises.
---
You know, that means that any unyielding build just flat out gets more XP and Score for playing... 
---
Reinforcing the meta yet again.
---
Thank you for providing us with an update!
---
Hell, at this point I'd take a 1* bloodied fixer, these things are unicorns to me.
---
My problem isn't dailies and weeklies by themselves, just them being the vast majority of the score system is infuriating. I'm tired of getting the dailies done and not having anyway to get score besides the 10k xp.
---
Did you not read my post? Maybe they want to confirm it’s an issue before they go looking for the cause. They may want to see if it’s just people doing something wrong or if it’s their game being wrong.
---
Haha well you're not the only one to point it out. I suppose a post about accuracy is one that invites observations on its own accuracy. :P
---
Legendary perks aren't in game
---
My BOS jumpsuit and crazy guy mask is worth more than the plan, do you think I’d trade that for the plan??  Fuck no
---
Look, when you've done the possum challenge to get whatever backpack mod you're after, you'll realise how ridiculously misinformed your comment is.
---
Ultracite .308 is easier to craft than regular .308
---
Not really cause I know I’m right
---
Is it something they were supposed to come out with or?
---
Depending on if you’re just doing the dailies and weeklies then about that. You would probably beat it by a level or three if you’re only doing those things due to the daily level up requirement. That’s also dependent on if you don’t create a new character just to get that over with easily. Assuming it takes you 10k average (you’ll need more at higher levels, though I don’t have that info offhand) to level up then in 70 days you’ll reach 7k more score. That’s barely enough for the last 2 levels. It will fluctuate, but there is little room for slacking off. If you miss a day you’ll miss 2k. If you miss a week then it’s 21.5k. If you only miss NW challenges then it’s 25k across the entire board.
---
I did not add in events because the common agreement is they currently don’t give score, and even if they did, they aren’t working for me so I had no numbers to add.
---
IMO just wait for a while, they'll have to change it with a patch if we keep whining loud. Don't settle with spamming enter.
---
Wtf really? On Xbox too?
---
I’m so tired of not having a skin for my favorite weapon. Bethesda please, please give me a skin for it.
---
Been doing it to me for awhile now. One minute the game works the next it’s giving me the error again.
---
[Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect). That's you.
---
Been delayed till September
---
You're right, there's currently an issue where weekly challenges are giving their SCORE rewards early before you've completed all of the subchallenges. We're working on a fix for this, and thanks for the report!
---
I’m not the type of gamer who has time to complete every challenge each day lol. I can maybe bust out a couple but to expect the player base to complete every challenge and gain 10k experience each day is a little ridiculous. That said, I’m only level 59 but I just finished up both quest lines so my time with this game is coming to an end anyways.
---
Score double points? That will help a fair amount with getting to 100.
---
&gt;Every single time there’s been an update with broken or controversial features we get silence         
---
      
---
&gt;The only responses I’ve seen are to low hanging fruit posts and even those are “we’ll look into it”     
---
     
---
Make up your mind; are they silent, or are they posting responses? You can't have it both ways. Hyperbole doesn't help anything.
---
Honestly idk if it's a Bethesda problem or a Sony problem anymore cuz a couple other games also got that same error, but it's not like it happens everytime I play right, it's only random occasions that I get this error
---
Gaining XP is part of leveling up so you kind of have to include that repeatable
---
Steel dawn won’t be releasing on patch 22 it seems, then probably patch 23 and I’m gonna guess it drops on October 23rd
---
Just wait until the week after the season ends, when all the stuff appears in the Atom Shop. People who spent all that time are gonna RAGE. :3

If you do a full health build I recommend keeping a nocturnal weapon handy. I know they're mostly seen as a joke but actually get a tidy boost at night. I've actually done a full nocturnal sniper build ( using an instigating during the day ). Kills a scorchbeast in a couple of shots no problem.
---
It really does suck that it's like that, I've been silently hopeful for awhile but this season has killed it. Im interested to see how the next few weeks pan out though, maybe we'll hear something, probably not.
---
So we have some double SCORE events coming up, which should help get people caught up and cut down on some of the grind (and hopefully they’ll repeat it).
---
Also nice to know ahead of time about the purveyor sale.  It’s only 25% but better than nothing, so I’ll start grinding out plenty of Scrip
---
Yep! Really excited about that, since I know I won't be able to jump on and grind it out daily
---
Exactly. I mean, hell, there's a comment directly below this still claiming to be curious if you have to pay for seasons (you don't), and they mentioned that in official news posts, maybe even in the game itself...! This is old news to those of us keeping up with everything, sure, but a trailer video like this is clearly intended to try and get the attention of a wider audience, who might not have known already.
---
To make my wife happy since she isn't terribly bothered by the majority of the flaws. Well until now. The loss of free atoms and realization that it's going to be endless more of the same has broken her spirit and made her want to go back and play FO4?
---
Ugh.  I got the same thing from purveyor today, minus the ability bonus.  Too bad I don't use heavy weapons and I obsessively stay at max health.
---
I guess I should have created a vending machine to see if anyone wants to buy it for a few caps, but I just turned it in for a handful of scrip towards my next roll.  I don't really want to draw people to my camp.  It's just kinda embarrassingly unimaginative and practical.
---
Hope you’re ready to dish out your wallet if you want the Captain Cosmos PA skin with a black coat of paint this time.
---
But doesn't it take time to 'bond' and get the full bonus?
---
and double xp too. im gonna farm that hard lmao.
---
PC
---
edit: the pc dupe works with a cheat program called erectus, but beth doesnt seem to care.
---
We mentioned this in another thread, but there is an error in some of the Seasons information we provided, which we plan to correct. 
---
Right now, there are Challenges to complete Events and Public Events that grant S.C.O.R.E. At this time, however, Public Events themselves do not currently grant S.C.O.R.E., though this is something we're talking about as a potential addition as we look to bring further improvements to Seasons in the future.
---
You’re right, should have specified. I mean it i. The sense that actual issues/ bugs people are concerned about there’s silence, but they’re more than happy to reply to petty things
---
You should look into a "Junkies" build if you want to keep your high hp. Or a "Bloodied" build if you don't mind the rads (Emergency Protocols PA chest mod on your PA will help keep you alive if you go Bloodied).  
---
Both SHOULD be able to do a loooooot more damage :D
---
Great question. I'm not sure if team related perks are triggered by this and would love to know. A really easy test would be to throw on strange in numbers if you have marsupial
---
Language!  And don't pick your nose!
---
I dont have that.. but I've got an f/25/agi i/e/15rl and e/e/90 lmg's on xbox

It is just called scrip gold is something else and hes it is random

He is partof the random Mothman spawn too!

---
 &gt;Right now, ther...
---
im glad this one is a discount instead of the mystery pick. at least this way people can pick whether they want weapons or armor and what category of weapons.
---
Ok dr Phil
---
Yeah I completed a couple of the weekly events and got awarded no experience at all. Pretty sure it’s a player wide bug that a lot of people are experiencing on all platforms. Added up and can see that I’m missing a couple thousand experience at least. Can’t even make up by getting experience due to 100 every 2 hours or something stupid. At the moment it’s a bust if people have said we would pretty much need to do everything for max rank in pass. I’ve already lost some already so gg lol
---
If not for my wife being super into both the franchise and base building, I would have stopped playing right after "beta". I have absolutely enjoyed aspects (base building) but the overall experience has been trying to find small bits of fun despite the best efforts of the devs, not due to them. And that's sad.
---
Wow, that's quite appalling. If it was as simple as an error in the FAQ they should have said so on Tuesday.
---
Crazy, I've seen dozens of random Mothmen but never a wise one. Something else to keep hunting for.
---
Thanks. I feel kind of dumb looking for something that doesn’t exist🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Again, it’s barely going to reach the end even with that. Like I said, you’ve got a leniency of a couple levels at the end. If you’re skipping dailies then the xp needed to balance it out starts moving up quickly. The main issue with the Season has nothing to do with it being unachievable, but more that you can’t just skip a few days and take a break and still come back and not fall behind hard. If you stop playing for 3 days for any reason then you miss 6k score. There also doesn’t seem to be any forgiveness for missed dailies returning to be completed later if you miss them on one day like other games have
---
If you’re dedicated to doing everything for the next 70 days then you’ll do fine. Casual players who play off and on will not be able to reach level 100, not without buying levels
---
No Joke on the responder version? I just got my 3rd one last night when leveling a new alt flatwoods. I thought you got it every time like the paramedic.
---
Legendary are necessary..imo anyway.  
---
And what you are doing is right.  You turn in scrip with a chance of getting something good.  Most times you will get rubbish though.  Keep at it.  I've exchanged probably 50 plus items so far.  There are players who've probs exchanged thousands.  
---
You can always get scrip for the rubbish she gives you.
---
Your view on “the economy” is pretty funny. The value on stuff is so subjective and one person saying what something is worth doesn’t make it true. For example, for me, those two cosmetics aren’t worth much. I would give away a jumpsuit I’d never wear, and the masks are good to trade to collectors that just gotta have them. I have all the rare masks and all but the deathclaw ones are collecting dust. The high capacity backpack mod actually adds a real benefit that I use daily AND it’s a pain in the ass to get. If people aren’t budging on it unless they get something over the top, I totally understand. I’m someone that’s gotten it legit and then had only two spares in my whole 2k hours of playing. One was bought for like 4k and the other with badges. It’s not an easy one to come by, unless you just get it yourself by doing the challenges.
---
metal helmet too.
---
Oh awesome, thank you very much
---
You make really good points. I've followed the story from original post, (I believe) and watched the whole thing become "redditised". Accuracy breeds controversy and peeps cant resist trying to pull the facts to pieces. I wish you luck in bashing your head against the wall of doubt.
---
we know
---
Yes...i actually did simply turn around and dump it back into the exchange...got 30 for it i think.    
---
I'll keep at it then...Thanks.   And also, cool screen name
---
It’s not 100% of the game though it’s just a season pass. I don’t think it should require as much time or be as difficult as they have made it. They should probably check the average weekly playtime of their player base and go from there.
---
IIRC, you need 8 possum badges to get the mod :)
---
as soon as you leave the vault i believe. 
---
I've seen a level 4 at scorched earth before. I mean it is possible they just travelled there with someone.
---
Did AWOL last night and had 4 legendaries show up! Was easily avke to finish the weekly challenge if 10 legendaries.
---
Cheers.  It's my xbox gamertag...I use it for everything
---
You too!

BOOWM!
---
This is the only game it’s done it to me on. I actually logged on the game this morning, the shop wasn’t loading and it was saying I wasn’t a fallout 1st member so I restarted. And then it started doing this again.
---
\^\^ THIS!
---
Bethesda hired the guy who made the first UI for No Man's Sky and was like "The work you did there was great but could you make it worse for this converter?"
---
The 2-star one is better value and only if you're trying to get a The Fixer, otherwise its a terrible way of getting guns. If you're after regular legendaries you're better shopping at peoples vendors, you'll see a lot of over priced crap but there are plenty of diamonds to be found. You can also follow one of the many farming routes easily available online, or do one violent night/riding shotgun/guided meditation since they regularly spawn legendaries.
---
2 words: farmable tiles
---
yeah.. it kind of sucks.. but it works.. which is more than can be said of the adrenaline perk..
---
should be bitching about that.. not a shitty UI..
---
Yep
---
nothing compared to my nocturnal security baton, which I rightfully call the “nightstick”
---
Press alt+f4 for god mode in any game. Works every time!
---
I would vastly prefer a machine I dump ammo into, and it gives me back the raw materials that I can use for crafting.
---
Super Simple.
---
I had just come back for Wastelanders after taking a few months off. Being a max build budget and full stash there just wasn’t anything to do. The new story and gold grind worked for a bit, but the gold grind quickly became repetitive and again, with no stash space, not much point in unlocking the gold gear.
---
Now another layer of grind for stuff I still can’t store without throwing out other things I’ve collected? No thanks. 
---
On the plus side, finally getting my gaming backlog caught up since I’m not losing hours to stash management.
---
No joke. I was using the bow the other night, and invariably EVERY ENEMY, the first shot would miss, the second shot would hit. There's no way that "just happened".
---
I have a better fix.
---
Scrap it.
---
They want you to spend atoms to buy your levels. That's the real secret plot they hide behind this aberration
---
Fix your shit
---
Aren’t people selling it?
---
the real fix: don't use it
---
my life is too short to waste, i rather drop unwanted ammo or leave them in vending. and just craft/buy ammo
---
Thank you for acknowledging the issue. If I may be bold, I'd suggest getting rid of the terminal interface. It slow, which is fine for reading of entries, but not for actions that we want to make dozens of times. Please, don't try to speed up the terminals. Instead my suggestion is to go for vendor or crafting interface.
---
Depends on how you interpret the graphic where it says “double dailies”. Does that mean the SCORE is only doubled on the daily challenges?
---
I love it especially the public teams I meet some cool people on there so not all bad plus I'm a fallout guy I played 3 and 4 fallout
---
Yeah RNGesus can be fun sometimes.
---
I think the most I've had there is three, and that's fairly rare. It's normally just the one at the end and maybe another with the spawns if you're lucky.
---
Have you done the quest for it yourself? It cannot drop for you if you have not done the quest yet.
---
Let me guess, the Wendigo Colossus is gonna have 20.000 health but you can only do 10.000 damage per day. Wanna kill it? Stick around without dying using these handy Stimpaks from the Atom store until the dmg cap resets and continue.
---
Aw shit, here we go again - CJ
---
This is good news! Can't wait for them to do this. We're already a rank 13
---
No the bond stays at Max. Sorted!
---
I see a lot of people going on about the caps and restrictions - I'm sorry to say, they make very much sense. If anything, they're a staple to MMOs. Yes, it's a Fallout game, but it's also an MMO. Such "mechanics" are just part of the game, at the core it's perfectly pointless to cry about themp. A grind has to be a grind, so it keeps people playing and logging in every day, for as long a period of time as possible, so there are good statistics they can show to the shareholders and other finance people. It also has to be restricted, though, otherwise the nolifers would burn through it in a few days and then start complaining about not having anything to do, until they eventually drop off and the player count starts decreasing.
---
You notice I said "at the core", and there's a reason for it: the scaffolding is nicely built up, but at the same time there really is no doubt that most of the details, most of the numbers could do with adjustments of various degrees. Daily caps, for starters, definitely are questionable at best - that on scrips or gold bullions, for example. Shift those to weeklies and they would do all the good they are meant to without hurting as much as they hurt now. (And indeed, non-endgame currency should not have any daily/weekly limit at all, a max cap on it is more than enough.) And while the daily/weekly challenges are nice to have to increase SCORE, with the amount of points needed, adding SCORE rewards to public event completion (and this doesn't need any cap either) really is the least they could do. This would not only make the point grind more bearable, but actually viable for more than just the nolifers. Of course it also underlines the fact that we need more/new public events, but that's an entirely separate discussion too... (And yeah, regardless of whatever they've said so far, we don't actually *know* whether we'll be able to complete season 1 after season 2 starts and thus just be "late to the game" or if it automatically just changes to an "atoms only" purchasable. That might make or break the whole setup.)
---
So yeah, in general, the dailies/weeklies are one of the few things Bethesda actually got right. They just need (some major) adjustments, because the devil's in the details there - and they are something that need constant attention, regular changes as the game moves on and the endgame formula changes. Someone hand them the memo, because they don't seem to have gotten it so far.
---
Click on your name bar - same one you click on to leave team or world etc. There you see the option to change team goals. Simply select the goal you wish to change to and that's it.
---
I dont know anything about camp building but the best i saw was a windmill generator used as an elevator inside the camp 😜
---
me as well, i always get low lvl drops that are great for a low lvl player. 
---
a furious explosive hunters riffle lvl 1 that does 100 dmg 
---
i tried putting things like this in my vendor for 100 per \* they had so low lvls could afford them but maybe high lvls would leave them alone. didnt work, i kept getting  cleaned out by high lvl players. started just giving them away. and thats a problem of its own as well if the person is actually low lvl
---
And outside of short periods of stability, where the bugs haven't been overwhelming and odious, it has been.
---
The fact that it had reached a relative plateau of usability right before Wastelanders, only to be deluge by returning and worsening bugs is insanity.
---
The fact that we now have a PTS and basic, obvious things that people from the PTS claim to have reported is bad. Very bad.
---
The fact that monetization has been ratcheted up yet again, especially in light of no new content since mid last year, outside of an admittedly enjoyable 10ish hours of solo content, is very troubling.
---
I've paid for games with both an upfront buy-in AND monthly fee (World of Warcraft). Every comparisons I've seen people make in here between this dumpster fire and an MMO is laughable. Yet this game is laden down with heaps of micro transactions that apologists claim are the only reason we even have the lights on, let alone "new content". In WoW there were no extra fees for a LONG time yet you still got a crazy amount of content. And making an alt wasn't because you wanted to try a new build that would be prohibitively punishing to implement, but to experience an entirely new style of game play.
---
This game can't even get core aspects of the franchise right. Even things that worked in 4. It's broken.
---
got it, thanks. and good work.
---
grind it out and stop being a lazy shit. i literally had to trade nothing to get it.
---
Perfect! Thank you for your quick answer! It may be me but that wasn't where I expected it to be!
---
you get probed
---
If you are aware, poeple we clinging to Public Events giving SCORE as their last hope for easing the grind. It may have been an error in the FAQ, but now the cat is out of the bag. People want this and you should implement it ASAP, not just wait for next Seasons.
---
It's still available, look in your challenges.
---
This is absolutely unacceptable.
---
Fix the events so that they give SCORE points.  It encourages people to participate, which has been sorely lacking until now.
---
You want a multiplayer fallout - then have feature sets that encourage multiplayer activity.
---
Did you per chance modify or write protect the ini files in the games install folder and documents/my games/fallout76, or use mods that do that for you?
---
Usual generic advice: 
---
* validate the game files via Beth launcher or steam 
---
* delete all ini files (backup them first maybe) and let the game regenerate them at next launch
---
* maybe check if your windows display settings show a 2nd monitor (marked as the primary one) which is inactive/turned off at the moment - the game always tries to launch at the primary display, windowed or borderless windowed will just go to the 2nd display if the primary one isn't there, fullscreen might just close.
---
Only reason I know is cause I'm constantly checking posts cause the devs at times like to be ninjas and not always say everything
---
then fucking scrap it. some of us find it useful.
---
I unlocked it back in Facnacht, that might be why I don’t see it. I’m also not seeing the Christmas and Halloween rewards but I never got those
---
This game occasionally makes me reevaluate what I need in a game to feel satisfied.
---
In what way is that secret?
---
I had one in each wave, plus the very last one. I had a full public team with me as well.
---
CHALLY!!!!
---
Thanks legend
---
there are pretty much always 3rd party dupes on pc.
---
Ranged does benefit if you’re using stealth and crits from luck and agility
---
Bloodied commando/rifleman is an extremely powerful and extremely popular for a reason! I switched from melee to commando and have never looked back
---
I wear the... uh, i forget what it's called. It's black. I hide in black bushes. People literally trip over me and keep running.   
---
Another tip: Holster your weapon. Nothing gives you away like a rifle sticking out of a bush.
---
You can bump your xp per kill up to 350+ with INT/XP boosts to significantly lower that kill count. Great tool. Hope it helps some.
---
Because Bethesda does not deserve us fixing their shit for them.
---
I didn't expect it there either!
---
you can start it directly from the exe ya know..
---
FWIW your fancy internet calculator jives with the mediocre Excel spreadsheet I whipped up yesterday. I figured if I don't do (most of) the NW challenges but do literally everything else and there's no Double XP weekend and the progression curve is a consistent +25 per SCORE level (all specious assumptions to be sure) I'll hit Level 100 on the last day with _maybe_ 1-2,000 points to spare.
---
It’s still around
---
Bummer :(
---
Are you using the double unyielding glitch? 1500 damage is pretty normal for ranged sneak vats attacks with the added bonus of clearing mobs quicker. Against a boss on the ground you'll do better, just not at much else.
---
 "this mostly means waiting in fast travel loading screens for 15 minutes "
---
so true!
---
Nice you're ahead of the curve...and me! I'm at rank 11, but I have skipped N.W. so I've gotten about 13 repeats under my belt already. If any more easy N.W. come up like stims or pictures in the vault I'll bite that bullet to get 250 no problem.
---
thats a long wait.. 8(
---
hopefully adrenaline will be working again by then..
---
and please make it so that you can put that skin on the combat rifle and fixer as well. since it is a full model conversion, there is 0 reason for it to be locked to 1 gun that has multiple skins and not allow it to be applied on to a gun that has 0 skins. especially if you add custom animation, which this skin needs as the reload animation is not even correct since it will just override the weapon's animation
---
Oh, and Adrenaline doesn’t work anymore.
---
Yep I have that on my heavy character but he's all set with a better gatling plasma. He carrys all the heavy weapons around, all the time lol
---
I thought you'd click on the team icon and get the option to change, oh well! Thanks again 😊
---
just hit 15 my self grinding like crazy lol
---
am i wrong in thinking that even if you cant play more then 10 minutes a day more on a week end that if it took you a year you could still complete the seasons? are they time gated and i didnt read that ?
---
I know! There were like 14 of them
---
I have full unyielding and yes you absolutely gain more xp for everything
---
It's crazy how much harder it is to carry sniper rifles than it is gigantic miniguns!
---
Melee is more damage but way more risk and frankly an absolute ballache at scorched earth events. I've been going through the rigmarole of converting mine to a stealthed range build because it's far less hassle.
---
that makes sense, and that is something that Bethesda completely lacks when it comes to this game
---
I think I got hosed on SCORE points for two weekly challenges, anyone else notice this?  Did a lot of grinding last night and completed 2 weekly’s today and didn’t see my total go up ...
---
That could actually work.. even for Bethesda's back pocket. 
---
People who don't play daily could get back to the same level as those who do by having a huge session on a weekend, but there's still enough "work" involved that many people will still pay instead.
---
Even if they did it just for the dailies and kept the weeklies just for the week.
---
It also obsoletes melee builds with 1 card
---
Yea its annoying but if all you are doing is waiting, best to stay on the terminal, just like project paradise. Never trust the randos....NEVER
---
It's going to be a Dry July though.
---
It’s not abandoned just because you don’t like it lol
---
On one hand I agree, on the other hand Battle Royale isn't an Unreal Tournament Deathmatch. Hiding is a viable strategy in BR. The goal is to be the last one that survives, not the last one who kills everyone else.
---
Kills should definitely be rewarded more, but the focus on survival needs to stay. From my experience, staying hidden allows people to sometimes survive long, but it basically nullifies the changes to win the match. PVP and scavenging gets the best equipment, so the "survivalist" end up undergeared for the last fight.
---
Missing a whole week...but pretty sure if I do 3 circuits of my leveling grind per evening I'll make it within day 63...ugh. So teams of 4, 4x exp, int 40, cranberry cobbler, meat stew, and a whole lot if gusto I think I can beat it by day 50 or so T.T
---
It was in their 2019 [Roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57rzdd8RrXf5hNuIF3ofZJ/5e77803a3f8a7c43259a1b1f672ec2ff/Fallout76_RoadMap_2018_02-21_FINAL.PNG) and they were calling it legendary players. 
---
&gt; **New Feature: Legendary Players** – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities. 
---
Sure this was their first planned time frame for that, but it was first given that it would be coming in summer 2019
---
Junkies rules pvp and is a close second in popularity in pve. Mentats withdrawal = -1 CHR. Must be devastating. Don’t know how I’d recover from that.  Also you need about 16 perk points at least not to die all the time, not even talking damage. Bloody is worth it because the damage. Junkies is worth it because you can kind of cruise and not die. The extra damage bloody does is irrelevant in almost every situation. Both are 1-3 shorting everything.
---
If they buff the score bonuses like each mini weekly objective drops 250 score and the xp one starts out at 1000 score and declines to 100 in 100 score less each time and give more atoms i could actually see myself enjoying the grind to an extent, especially if every week you got 1000 score for completing a treasury note event once each, with maybe an additional 250 score for each team member you've got a bond with.
---
yes i know, but when next update will come - my game will not update you know... you need laucher to do that
---
Be sure to check Overgrown Sundew Grove after every SBQ fight. 2 out of 2 for me so far after patch 20.
---
So we can add +1 month minimum at the rate Bugthesda has been delaying stuff...
---
Instead of Bethesda incorporating each piece in Display Cases individually off of the budget, maybe they could come up with a way that counts them filled as a single piece? Might be easier for magazines and likely easier, the Bobblehead shelf and Bier Stein? As all the Bobbleheads have their own separate position on the Display, they could create different models for every possible configuration of them, maybe? I have NO idea about programming so if this is stupid, my bad. lol! ;)
---
Continue to pray to the Mothman 🤞🤞🤞
---
at least now it lets you pick from more than v76 and your camp, still broken though
---
Dude was inside the wall next to his bed when i walked in the door, then he teleported to sleep again and before my brain could reread in my imagination "no more ward sleeping" he teleports yet again straight in front of me, starts dialogue instantly, and auto-completes my daily. That would have been meh, only i got not rewards, and couldn't turn it in again until I jumped servers.
---
The robot one?
---
Thanks!   I guess my goal here is to better survive and take on tougher enemies.   Saw two lower level (level 20's) players last night that took down 2 Scorchbeasts on their own.    I'm level 50 and I run away as fast as i can go.   Granted, i've been building my arsenal (Rifleman build started late) but i sure would like a BFG in tow just in case where I can at least either defend myself, or help a lower level player in danger.
---
Ok thanks just curious. I started a new toon today and no events were showing still a level 3 though
---
that made me smile.  
---
thanks.
---
Preach
---
They do change things occasionally.  Just not for the better.
---
I'm not sure what the double unyielding glitch is, or how it's used. Would you be able to explain? I'm sorry.
---
Yay! Can we stop complaining about score? I'm pretty sure not even 2-3 weeks ago we heard about a battle pass like system. It was released. Everyone was mad because they thought it was payed for ahhahaa. When its free people get mad. I could imagine being mad all the time. Miserable life style.
---
No it doesn't, also the other respawn bug where you can't respawn at all is still here, I had to close the game down to get out of that!
---
To be fair, I would not be surprised by delays, especially in response to PTS feedback. I somehow suspect the reception of a major balance overhaul in patch 22 might end up being mixed (or worse) among PTS players, and it will be pushed back, similarly to the legendary perks.
---
It completed early for me, so I got the robot score after 3/5 completed.
---
Good thing the ENTIRE MAP doesn't load on our systems simultaneously though, right? Or am I missing something there?
---
That sounds cool, never seen that.
---
Appreciate your answer.  Thanks for all you do.
---
Build up workshop and gather building supplies. They were the last ones I had for weekly.
---
Yeah I could do without the N.W. challenges. But it's really easy to get the repeatable XP one. Especially if you get a bonded events team of 4. I don't see why some people are complaining about the repeatable challenge.
---
You do. It’s just that the reward comes after 3/5
---
yeah no. the complaining actually prompts discussion (usually) 
---
better then the constant karma whoring "this community is so amazing", atom shop circlejerks, and mental gymnastics trying to justify increasingly shitty monetization.
---
if you want to stick your head in the sand, go ahead but dont expect everyone else too.
---
Ranged does benefit from AGI, in that you get more AP which translates into more shots in VATS without recharging. It also benefits from it if you're playing sneak.
---
If you wanted to explore a different build, you can make the switch to heavy guns without needing to switch around many (if any) SPECIAL points, just perk cards. If you're playing on PC you could also add the Perk Loadout Manager mod to make it easy to switch back and forth between the two builds. The only real source of incompatibility is if you're running the Talons mutation, because it really does play havoc with your aim.
---
Sniper and commando both are going to involve moving a lot of SPECIAL points, to the point where it might be easier to just start a new character. You'll need to load up on PER, AGI, and LCK to maximize either of those builds.
---
No. You don’t. Trying getting xp. Maybe they will one day sort the repeatable public events also. 
---
What are you talking about stealth builds? What does that have to do with anything? Why are you talking about run and gun? I’m very confused.
---
I completely understand why they do what they do to keep the player count up, i have no problem with them trying to keep people playing. It irritates me that i am limited by the restrictions set in place to keep the player count up, that i am punished for dedicating my time to get on and get the weeklies and dailies all done within a few days of it being out and having no alternative to get the new content (besides the horrible 10k xp time waster). We definitely need more variety and tweaking thats for sure, maybe one day i wont have anything to cry about!
---
[Most of the video is fluff, but it's two minutes and explains it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTKR3l0-KZg)
---
Of course not, completely missing a day puts you 2k behind... but in reality I'm enjoying this over the atom grind. Yea the atoms were nice, but I never spend them anyway because nothing crazy catches my eye. That new handmade skin l looks good but I'll gamble it comes back cheaper, and if not, still probably one use it over my matte black/gold plate/waster skins
---
You got the reward after doing 3/5 of the robots/camp items.
---
Technically the converter isn't bugged or broken. It's just clunky to use. I'm sure that the QA for this game has their hands full of searching for actual bugs and broken stuff...
---
So bloodied with ranged works best with stealth &amp; crits? If that's the case, that explains a lot.
---
Are the bonuses additive or multiplicative for sneak on top of bloodied?
---
Melee is fine and I feel strong, but I'd like to be able to take things down from afar without being thrust into the fray. Even though I do a lot of damage, sometimes I can't get a strike in quick enough against high level Yao Guai and they get me.
---
Bond
---
many posts about this.
---
What people want is to be able to scrip more then the 150 daily.
---
serious question. are seasons time gated? or if it takes you a year to get done it takes you a year.
---
Nothing wrong with people being mad about auto completions (be they early ones they didn’t notice or flat out bugged ones).  In fact, people should be angry about obvious unaddressed bugs.
---
Theres speculation that after the season ends the items will be in the atomic shop, dont know for sure tho
---
I’m pretty sure I did this as a low level a few weeks ago. I was at the shack for some mission and before I know it, all hell had broken loose.
---
Have they mentioned when they might pull the rewards or fix their oops?
---
Im curious if I need to be grinding NW hard or I got a couple days.
---
By definition, unarmed builds (i assume you mean unarmed melee, as it is far better than using basic melee weapons) can't be the strongest in my opinion. As you will have to move from enemy to enemy, while ranged is more efficient and faster as you can just stand in one spot and kill everything. Does unarmed do more single target damage? Absolutely. But most of the time you will be fighting more than one enemy, and the enemy will be spread around the area you are in.
---
Ranged do benefit from increased specials. Agility = better stealth, more AP for vats, INT = more experience from doing stuff, PER = more vats accuracy, STR = more carry weight (i even use radicool because of this), LCK = faster recharge for critical hits (very important for top tier builds).
---
Now.. Both unarmed and ranged can be are extremely powerful. And are two different and fun playstyles. So there is no point arguing which is better. For me personally there is no competition, bloodied stealth commando is the top build / playstyle in this game. Very closely followed by bloodied PA heavy gunner and bloodied unarmed. All 3 are very viable and close to each other.
---
🤣😂
---
I think i have one, whats your psn?
---
I had 2 of them award at 3/5.  Alot of people are saying the same.thing.  I think bethesda has already ackowowled it but a ticket never hurts.
---
They don't start popping up on the map until around level 7 or 8. I forget exactly when.
---
Wow that's pretty good. I was able to clock a pace of 7 repeats in 34min. Meaning it was 70k xp in that time frame. It's amazing how fast you can grind XP when you actually FOCUS on it. I never did that and instead did dailies. If anything, i learned that dailies not not worth the time invested if you have limited time.
---
4-8 scrip and 1k xp fora 15min daily is no where near 35kXP, and swapping characters to get the 150 limit on scrip exchange with all the junk legendary things you get anyway.
---
I have shifted my play style and its more relaxing now. If only camp building wasn't a waste of xp/hr my base would look decent...
---
Gah good advice! I'm going to run it if I see it now
---
I love how you had to put (hyperbole) because there's always that one "iT's NoT tHaT bAd" guy lmao
---
I agree but you never gonna win all your melee fights despite the adrenaline rush and fun of pure melee...you gonna need a backup gun for such emergencies.
---
PC...
---
Ahhhhhh living the dream.
---
30,000 caps on eBay for $6. They make a huge profit by playing it properly
---
Meh. 
---
Yeah, still don't remember a time frame as in "summer". 
---
Was pretty annoyed that NW was hinted at being so much content, a true game changer overall, and it just being a BR.
---
I figured at that point Beth was focusing more on PvP, and almost permanently shelved the game. It actually lead me to missing most of Meat Week and the entire Halloween event. 😒
---
Glad I decided to wait on/for Wastelanders, though.
---
Peaching4Life
---
Armor workbench under underarmors, must have the plan from reg first
---
How did killing enemies become 'not worth doing' in this game?
---
They just today announced double xp and double dailies score weekend. Hope those prove to be good boosters for the casuals and hard core players alike.
---
i must be wrong then =0
---
Wish I could downvote twice... such arrogance.
---
You on now?
---
* They should make events rewards SCORE.  
---
* Add more ways to progress through the board.
---
Secret Service armors are superior to any other normal armors.
---
I know that it's complicated now that the cat is out of the bag (the skins are released), but please please please consider making them also into separate weapons. The game could always use some more variety!
---
You may have got it when you achieved 3/5 of the tasks, much like I did, but didn't realise. This seems to be happening to a few people :)
---
I love this community so much 💗
---
Probably the secret service armor
---
hope they arent planning on waiting until august to fix adrenaline...
---
Secret Service for normal zones and Chinese Stealth for nuke zones.
---
QA isn't just about bug hunting. It's about overall quality. Obviously bugs affect quality but so too does poor gameplay experiences.
---
A bit of both there.  They'll be the first ones to yell when the player base drops in half once people who have hopes and dreams of really grinding putter out and start playing other games.
---
The decision making baffles me as there's totally a blueprint of other successful games that all you need to do is cut and paste.
---
That's fine as long as you inserted your own card. I had insert a card then the low level went on the terminal and summoned the imposter.
---
It was my card not his.
---
Bethesda needs to fix this along with a lot of other stuff
---
They aren't out yet
---
Yeah, currently saving up for that, but that 20 treasury note cap is killing me
---
Aw damn, could’ve helped but I’m PS4, good luck and keep grinding!
---
Do you have to have the plans like you do for the others . So all the lined plans to get shielded?
---
Yup
---
Was not aware, thanks for sharing!
---
Yea give them praise when they do it right please I love these. When I swapped the team type on the fly and everyone kept their bonds with each other i was like....YES!!! stay builder for most of the time to get the INT boost, then quick swap to event for an event to finish, then back to builder for the casual. Oh a 3\* scorch beast? Let me pop it to hunter real quick and back.
---
Just make sure you team leader is on top of things. I'll volunteer!
---
Vault "69" would require an equal split to live up to its name.
---
How do you switch group types?
---
That’s not a score quest - just a regular side quest that’s been in the game from the start
---
The limits are fine. They are there to get you to log in daily, not burn through everything immediately. If you don't want to be overweight either get FO1 for the scrapbox or stop picking up everything in the game.
---
if you're looking to offload that fixer plan, i'd give it a good home
---
So.... there was no QA? 
---
They were telling the testers they would get a free 250 level character to try out the new legendary perk system (which seems to have vanished)
---
These folks should be at that level already
---
I've not seen it for sale, but then again, I scroll rather quickly through plans marked (Known), so I may have missed it at any given vendor.
---
Blackwater mine has a lot of oil based junk.
---
Might of been what happened
---
Man, I love this game, and when Wastelanders came out I was still loving it in a more old-school way, but adding competition like this makes me feel rushed in whatever I'm doing just to try to stay relevant. I'm not regretting my Fallout 1st purchase or the few Atom purchases I've made over the past couple of years, but now I feel like as a full-time working dad I will never get to see the things I read about here on Reddit.
---
The longer you spend in a group, the more your bond grows, shown by that blue bar. If a little link symbol appears on it, your buff for being in the public team increases. 
---
I'm not sure about all of the different types, but for event teams, this increases the amount of XP you'll be earning , depending on how many players you've formed this 'bond's with
---
I hope we get more rebuilding Appalachia community challenges
---
Thanks man.    Appreciated!
---
Yeah, I am actually already. I just hoped if there was something more to fo76. I like fo76, but every time I log on I feel like I’m forcing myself to play it since the grind is uninteresting to me.
---
Here's the thing.. though you may have completed that repeatable 13 times last night, as you rank up in SCORE it is going to take more and more grinding of that exact same repeatable in order to gain a SCORE rank, as it increases by 25 with each rank. 
---
Now take into account that people have lives outside of the game. Maybe it doesn't take you long to complete the other dailies, but some people may be slower at that than others. It could take them an hour, two hours, who knows. Then add in the amount of time it would take someone to complete the repeatable, say 15 times, to rank up from like rank 14 to 15, just a potential example..
---
For one, that sounds boring af. 
---
Secondly, most people with lives outside of the game aren't going to have the time to grind the dailies then turn around and spend another 2+ hours trying to get another rank. 
---
The system is garbage. Please stop defending it and encouraging Bethesda's shitty practices further.
---
- on a side note, BUILDING (INT Buff) teams are better for numerous mobs events. Event XP teams are good for stuff like SBQ since there isn't a lot of mobs.
---
Wrong sub.
---
Secret Service is the overall best. Thorn can be better for a sneak build and solar for a high health build that works in a team. Neither of them have a jet pack though.
---
this is what i was arguing for when i said seasons, not this warmed over leftovers from the back of the 'fridge crap
---
I was running yesterday... Full XP team and 3 people popped their lunch pails. That 25% stacks (the time does not reset though each will end one hour after they start). I was well slept and had mama dulces in me. 4000 XP for encrypted 4000 XP for sbq fight. 1400xp for killing a deathclaw north of watoga. 600xp per kill of any 68 lvl enemy. 
---
PSA people PLEAASE join a public squad. We can debate all day if it's better to be in the build or event squad but being in neither is horrible right now. I have leveled on average 3 times per day so far (I'm now 389) and I'm about 200 points away from 14 game board spot.
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Nuclear winter is rubbish all the way around... it’s a garbage game mode. But I can say after doing it all night to try and get the Xmas and Halloween stuff, Frog Legs is a blessing for bush campers. Many times now someone sees me and I jump and take off running like the greased up deaf guy and they can’t catch me. 
---
(At one point I hide in a bush and didn’t realize I was right beside someone else who was in the same bush, so we both kinda stood there awkwardly. Someone else came up behind me and aimed at me with a gauss shotgun and last second I jumped straight up into the air and the shot missed me and obliterated the bush guy next to me. I landed on the roof and took off running and survived for another few minutes.)
---
Builder team is +4 INT and adds up to more XP over time. Do that instead if you are after XP. Then you can hot swap to events before event completes to cash in on that XP, then back to builder. I haven't hot swapped for legendary kills yet but I'd assume a 4x boost on xp from a lvl 80 scorchbeast would be nice. If its addition and not multiplicative its like 8k xp which would be TOTALLY worth that swap. Gotta test it though.
---
You can buy the shielded plan directly without buying the other lined plans
---
Well I don't think it's difficult at all. Time-consuming, yea, but it's specifically built to last a long time so players don't mass abandon during the content drought. xD
---
But I agree, checking up on player progress and tweaking seems like a good thing to do.
---
You on pc? I need to ride these coat tails
---
Thank you
---
I have a solid three seconds lag on most servers PS4. And, ghouls hit at thirty feet away while I backup ha ha ha
---
haha thanks!
---
I'm not even all that bothered about getting to 100.  What do you get that's even worth mentioning?  A chicken coop - does it even do anything?  A fireplace door - sounds interesting but I'll probably never actually use it.  And a bunch of skins - some are kinda nice but eh, they're just skins.
---
I will say I'm super glad the ammo converter isn't a high level reward, imagine how disappointing that would be.
---
I sent you a FR, join me
---
yea i didn't even do the two NW dailies its mostly been having the rested buff/ food exp buff an grinding super mutants  an what ever other events pop up i can do quickly. *Line in the Sand*  is amazing for this you can get 2 levels worth of exp from it if your killing most of the scorched by your self
---
Ok thanks
---
i immediately thought of the ring tone with Arnold repeatedly saying "Uzi 9mm" from that scene
---
Don’t panic, it will be free now on XBox game pass
---
Welcome the masses who are bored or RDR and GTA
---
What's legendary xp
---
I find myself overencumbered with no space for steel anywhere, having excavator set with calibrated shocks and no guns stored. I don't know how much stash space i can recover with the scrap box. I got 200 wieght units of food reduced into the 10's using the thru hiker perk and the chemist perk for the chems.
---
Gotta do an inventory check or something to see where the space is used mostly
---
For real, I jumped like 12 levels on the last double XP weekend!
---
I’m not sure what I’m sticking my head in the sand for - at no point did I remotely bring up anything about defending the game, the atom shop, or monetization. 
---
And if people want conversation maybe they should focus on a few posts instead of everyone making the same post over and over and over again
---
It can now also drop from ally quests.thats where I got mine from.
---
They both awarded at 3/5 for me
---
Correct, only daily challenges will grant double the SCORE rewards during those High SCORE Weekends, but that should still hopefully give you a bit of a boost!
---
Yeah in that case I'd just treat it as any other game that you would "complete" and shelf. You've completed the game! To be fair, the majority of games you'd get alot less than 150 hours in, so you got your money's worth.
---

Bethesda is a privately owned company. They don't have shareholders. Really sad to see so many people just spitting out this "big company bad" stuff when they don't even understand what shareholders are. For future knowledge: a company must be publicly traded in order to have shareholders.
---
put a ring on it

Lengendary run points

Escape on pc, fitting perfectly :)

---
You have just given upon the game because the stash is full? Have you considered mules?
---
Could I purchase a 50 caps knife and an adventure kit? I have been thinking on making a 2nd character for a while now and this just convinced me.
---
I wouldnt mind paying for the kit with my main character btw.
---
Just price your own vendor better and get rid of items no one wants, if you solely rely on the static vendors, you are doing it wrong.

 &gt; Hey! There's a post about this [in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjvw0c/what_is_the_official_answer_from_bethesda_on_how/fwpcpyg...
---
I didn't think about that for the INT! Thanks for the tip 🖤 Gonna definitely run that now and swap. Doing the legendary would definitely be worth it to see. Gonna have to try swapping that one as well
---
As someone who actively farms and gardens IRL, this repair cost is exactly why I refused to farm at my camp.
---
Was it my vampires lead pipe? I miss you sweet pipe, daddy will find you soon!
---
It doesn't mean that it can't use a better UI.
---
You can complete it.  There is lots of unknowns and bad numbers/misinformation.  We are on day 3.  You'll make it.
---
I've seen a bloodied unarmed guy take down the scorchbeast queen in about 40 seconds. After witnessing that, there's no doubt in my mind that unarmed mele builds are ridiculously OP.
---
That's actually normal. Humans don't turn to meat piles. They turn to paper bags.
---
Tbh, I still don’t know what the card is your talking about. And I definitely didn’t back then either.
---
Gonna find a way to dupe items with that tho
---
&gt; I know you will do the right thing,
---
Sure about that?
---
You most likely got them before completing them. There is a known bug with the challenges that tell you to do 5 things. They give the SCORE when you finish 3/5.
---
So you are ok with not completing the season? And you are ok with how painfully and artificially grindy it is? And Im not talking just about the legendary run, almost every aspect of the game fells like this. A very restrictive and artificial grind.
---
That's score and you should have gotten all of them, the only bug we know of for sure is multipart ones give score upon 3/5 but you could have encountered a new one, how much score did you have before you completed all challenges and each time it costs 25 more to level up
---
If I give you 1000 caps will you find my 1000 bags of dropped rockets and convert them into 50cal ammo? 
---
Now that would be a service. Ammo swapping. Give us your unused and we give you back something useful 
---
I used the ammo machine. I would pay for that
---
Yeah any boost helps. Is there any clarification on how SCORE is awarded currently for public events like it was mentioned?  It doesn’t seem like it is.
---
Why do people like this so much? I never find use for that thing
---
thanks :)
---
**Justice for Adrenaline**
---
XP is multiplied by INT*0.03+1, it is the same formula that is used in Fallout 4. The sources saying it is 2% per point probably use an already high base intelligence (unyielding armor?) as the reference.
---
Tbh I dont care if I complete it or not, and this is nothing new this is Bethesda ways since release, zero care in the world for the community
---
Im not worried about this seasons rewards, i dont like the precedent its setting. Longer grinds for casuals, with the possibility of high tier equipment like the ammo converter being further up in levels in the future. They already have a camp item for ammo, sure its extremely low level but how long until game shifting items like that are at lvl 100 and not 5. Just based on bethesdas past with 76.
---
You can complete the season even with missing a few challenges most people just got the math wrong [apparently ](https://youtu.be/UUnOYA-jFrI)
---
no diaper or floaties this time around so im out...
---
I’m sorry but it feels like you guys are living in an echo chamber when it comes to what you think people want in this game. 
---
The fact that doing EVERY challenge for the next 10 weeks won’t be enough to hit rank 100 is proof positive that you’ve designed this system in such a way that people MUST purchase their way through the last few ranks in order to unlock everything available unless they want to grind for several dozen hours in order to complete the EXP challenge enough to reach rank 100. That, along with the kneecapping of the earnable challenge atoms makes it clear to see that this was intentional on your part.
---
There are good way to monetise a game, and there are bad ways, and judging by the communities reaction the past couple days it’s pretty evident as to which one this is. Even if the events only gave 100-150 score that’d still be a great improvement over what we currently have and I personally would feel much more inclined to buy a couple ranks in order to avoid grinding out challenges so much so I can actually play the content which I enjoy.
---
Tatctical dot incoming: "."
---
It is at a 200+ fire rate because of the explosive effect i was told.
---
For that to work they'd have to offer something the playerbase really wants - as they fail to place even the most basic most requested stuff into the shop for over a year (and acknowledging the season rewards are shit for the most part), I suspect this plan will backfire.
---
Wow, TIL. Thanks for the tip... I've been struggling with making mutli-floor camps (with roof access) exactly because I wasn't able to get any stairs to properly stack...
---
It's a great full health damage booster.  Not t having this is like not having bloody mess x4.
---
They both rewarded you at 3/5 completion. It's a feature.
---
I wish people who posted about this would mention what their ranking is. It would help to know whether they are actually missing the XP, or just weren't paying attention when it was awarded.
---
How in the fuck did those servers keep it together enough last night in sbq fights and not shit the bed?  That was some spooky weird shit.  I think I did 5 last night and every time I thought ok this is it I’m gonna get kicked off.  Nope, finished every one.  It was like a Salvador Dali live action painting of a sbq fight.  Running through people.  People with their heads inside the queens ass.  I ran out of .50 Ammo and switched to a handmade but was still shooting the .50 with handmade Ammo?  I hope someone was videoing.  This was Xbox.
---
i think it helps if you remove, place the stairs and re-add the overlapping walls
---
Woahhh can you do this for PS4??
---
That same trick is useful for fixing parts of camps which can’t be removed due to being flagged as essential. You connect those on and build a path that anchors into the ground, which should allow the parts to be removed. However they may also need their own anchor points to be removed after. It gets broken quick
---
I get it. It sucks not to get a shot in, but if you are on a team and close enough to the downed mobs you’ll get to loot if any of your teammates get a shot in. 
---
That said if the mob isn’t level 50 or above I don’t even waste the ammo. Fasnacht and Treasure Hunter packed my stash and I still haven’t cashed in all the crap I got.
---
You work your way threw the van Lowe quest which I am sure you did and they give you a card to summon the imposter as part of the quest line most people don't know anything about it and get killed easily as they are to low a level. Lol
---
As you get higher level and better gear you can buy a card from a vender about 17k then use flux to craft a recall card so u can summon the vender and get the fixer plan or an outfit or as I usually get a white wolf fedora lol
---
Don't worry, people will downvote you
---
Maybe? I'm not sure. The only thing I can say is check.
---
I have played Encryptid on those dates, don't know if I dropped it. You know the weapon name?
---
What a shitty post, Todd. We won't buy your atoms.
---
I needed to drop caps, thought I’d use it for ammo converter
---
Hey! There's a post about this [in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjvw0c/what_is_the_official_answer_from_bethesda_on_how/fwpcpyg/), but to recap: There's some incorrect information about that on our website. It should state that there are challenges to "Complete Events" or "Complete Public Events" that *do* award SCORE, but Public Events don't currently grant SCORE all by themselves. We're talking about that as a future improvement, though! We're going to fix up the places where those details are incorrect.
---
Lol what?  The ONLY way it isnt useful is if you're a pacifist and don't kill things in the wasteland.
---
I level to 50 before I do much more than brush up against the early main story line missions
---
Make the NW challenges optional and I will agree
---
Awesome. Thankyou
---
Fail with that many people? I solo this event, the other day I kept two animals alive just having one other guy there who didn't even know what was happening.
---
They’d likely add a fourth perk
---
"Math" is the point for two reasons: first, you made the original post about math. Second, the primary argument that the poster made was math-based.
---
It is very simple: more choice is better than less choice.  Less grind is better than more grind. These are not up for debate. If a particular non-choice award appeals to someone, that is \*subjective\* and not a factor in an objective assessment of the reward-to-grind value of this Season compared to the previous Challenges design.
---
If someone is able to grind all the dailies and weeklies to the point of reaching Rank 100, they get a total of 1500 Atoms to spend on things of their choice.  The average group of dailies previously granted 50-60 Atoms and the group of weeklies averaged 150.  To make the math easy for you: this gave a weekly Atom gain of over 500 Atoms.  Which means a player could gain the entire amount of Atoms that this Season gives in under three weeks.
---
3 weeks is better than 11 weeks. There is no arguing this math. 
---
The other rewards are \*objectively\* inferior because they are not rewards of choice.  Additionally, the amount of Atoms that would be gained by doing the old dailies and weeklies over the amount of time the Season lasts would give the players enough atoms to buy even more items via bundles than the number of Shop-style items given on the entire rewards list.
---
Finally, note that not only did the old system offer objectively superior rewards for objectively shorter grind, but all was possible without ever going into Nuclear Winter. This means that you could get more for less grind AND have more free time because the Nuclear Winter time sink isn't required.
---
This \*IS\* a matter of functionality, not entertainment value. You really should have an argument with a solid foundation before trying to talk down to people.
---
You are meant to grind events and stay in the Lower level areas. Finding side missions and messing around
---
Angry Turtle will surely cover this.
---
I had the same thing it worked again after restarting the game
---
Correct it's because they just don't know lol
---
The thing about not all of them wearing capes.
---
Thats awesome of you to.post this and try to find owner  Outstanding observation that it had been modified. I accidently dropped my most important shotgun that I had used for 150 levels a few days ago.It hurt my wasteland desires....and it hurt my build. So it does happen and someone is lucky that there is a few  players out there like you. I doubt you will find them, but great of you to make an effort. Great post.
---
Where are my Ghille Stimpacks Damnit?!!!
---
Here’s what I did I grinded in the forest til level 15 then went to the toxic valley til level 25 then grinded in the ash heap til level 35 then grinded in the more to level 40 and then the cranberry bog really explore everywhere and the savage divide it’s whatever
---
spammed posts are from trogs that cant read or sort by new.
---
or shit posts, alot of those right now.
---
Yes, it can have the magic effect. They are Instigating, Junkies, Medics, Stalkers, 33 VATS, 50 limb, and bashing dmg.
---
It is actually easier to get the 200 fire rate since all gauss miniguns have an explosive effect. The explosive effect makes the fire rate be ×2 what it says on screen (although it might not work on sbq since she has explosive resistance but I dont actually know).
---
The penta barrel increases the firerate more than tri barrel, but at a heavy cost at damage. Angry Turtle suggests using the tri barrel over the penta, but for a magic minigun the penta might be better? Also, remember using prime capacitors to increase damage and make ammo cheaper to produce.
---
The best combo you can get are heavy metal arms, heavy leather legs, and a heavy combat chest. For a matching set you're best off with heavy combat or scout
---
Also. Do you want me to hook you up with some stuff to help your new character out?
---
I keep seeing all these calculations with the repeatable EXP weekly, and it looks like we will barely make it. But thats not the only repeatable it looks like. As per this video: https://youtu.be/XUctfeYsBbY  There is another repeatable, doing public events. I feel it will be exponentially easier to do 5 events than earn 50k exp, so then those weeks earning score will be much quicker.
---
Rank 10
---
Yeah
---
i agree with everything here.  i cancelled my first membership last month deciding to stop putting anymore of my money into this game (which i love, but is run by pure corporate greed and deception). Funny enough, it didnt cancel and i have paid yet again...  once there is some decent content i would be glad to throw more money around although if this wasnt my favorite game to play, i would be long gone due to morals.
---
I switched over from ESO for a while because I got so damn tired of indrik grind. If I know I can't do most of this without unending grind I'm just not going to play as much, honestly.  I'm already sick of trying to get the settlers to like me. Maybe do more Borderlands or a second run of HZD.  And I'm a Fallout nut, ffs. If I wanted to live in it this much I'd be working on a cosplay to get something tangible out of it.
---
according to the calculator if i am level 179 now, and I do every single daily challenge and all of the weekly challenges, no NW, it would take me about 60 days and I would be level 270 by the end.
---
I dunno but I cant see leveling up 100 times in the next 60 days
---
Sure I wouldn’t say no to someone wanting to help for sure.
---
You have 70 days to complete this current season.  There are 100 squares, so it stands to reason that on average, you'll need to clear 1.5 squares every day.
---
The actual accumulation of SCORE doesn't have a hard time gate, but it has a practical one.  The lion's share comes from Daily and Weekly Challenges.  You can grind XP (and Public Events at some point) for more, but the ratio of time to SCORE is a lot poorer with those.
---
Click on your name in the team tab and you can switch. You keep your bonds and team mates don't get kicked.
---
So true, the rewards aren’t very rewarding, and it really does seem like a punishment when u miss a day and all your buddy’s have left u behind.
---
Yea I thought about missiles after I posted that, ut yes it's perfect for missiles and mini nukes
---
Yeah it definitely is a negative for me as well, especially the reliance on luck, as you say. I only played it for the level up for score
---
GT?
---
I'll whip you up some level 5 and 10 stuff. Weapon of choice?
---
He's just a creative means of displaying the remaining time left in the season. Reach rank 100 before him and win the game, he gets there first and the game ends.
---
Everyone has to get on and play so they can properly hate it.
---
&gt;If they ever throw in a double-XP weekend, I can see being able to advance several levels per day, just utilizing the Public Teams feature.  
---
Funny you should say that, [the new roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg) has a double xp weekend in a couple of weeks. The weekend after is double SCORE from dailies too.
---
Haha! GARY!
---
i have a ts ffr rw flamer.  would that work for a flamer build? tell me more!
---
I’ll agree with you there. I understand the game is lacking in a lot of areas but hell dude, how many times do we have to bring up the ammo converter being a piece of crap. We all get it, it’s been discussed, let’s find something else to post about
---
Scandal!!!
---
Do u have fallout 1st
---
Yup.
---
I don't want to race Dr Zorbo for fun if I'm not going to have an actual chance to win or have fun.
---
I done it the last monday of the last double xp weekend. Had never done NW before as I hate pvp. Was about level 140ish and got 9 ranks just by opening perk packs. Hide in bushes and watched tv and got 400-800 per round. Took 6 hours or so.
---
Just tried patch 20 on XBOX ONE:
---
What a disappointment....
---
I did not get 1.000 score at the Weekly Challenges for collecting building supplies and destroy assorted robots......
---
Also the game is very laggy ALL the time, even use of the FAV wheel is hard to use due to lag...
---
Who is managing the freakshow!
---
Very poorly update, even with a PTS.
---
Fix the god damn game! For once....
---
How about grinding for bugs, when all the game content is all about grinding.
---
I guess fallout really did die with interplay... 😢
---
Let obsidian make the next game and the next, just give them the ip. 
---
It’s clear BE can’t handle it. 
---
Don’t even make me start on that ammo converter Lol..... 😑
---
Yeah dude sorry. I just got super excited. Then posted that and thought “why the fuck would they know? they just said they play on Xbox”. I’m actually looking it up now. Not really my brightest moment. I need more coffee.
---
Yes, sorry about that. This is a bug that was introduced by Patch 20 and we're working on a fix!
---
* [Comment by Valseek](/r/fo76/comments/hjyuc5/anyone_else_notice_all_workshops_have_standard/fwpjki7/?context=1000 "posted on 2020-07-02 15:59:04 UTC"):
---
 &gt; Yes, sorry about that. This is a bug that was introduced by Patch 20 and we're working on a fix!
---
So am I just understanding it wrong, or did they say you can jump back and forth between xbox and pc? If so does that mean xbox will be flooded with all the hacked stuff from pc?
---
It's always been the meta. Wasn't it obvious when all the other prefixes were significantly less powerful?
---
I’m not sure about the math but i pretty much steamroll everything that isn’t sheepsquatch or sbq
---
.. or try to get kills while bushin around. Im tellin you you can do some sneaky stuff with grenades, melle and that bow
---
Thank you!  I'm almost finished with the tadpole quest. Hopefully, I can progress afterwards.  Appreciate your quick response!
---
Glad there is some plan to help get more SCORE but I hope there's more than just this - I appreciate that this content is made with the intent of motivating players over months and it shouldn't be quick or easy but if the current estimations are correct it's way too harsh. Still, pretty nice to have a solid date listed for the next patch.
---
Use a flamethrower trap to destroy the brick wall. Then you slide that bad boy right in, repair the wall, and appreciate your handy work. 😋
---
GT is TENDER FIDDLES 
---
I dunno what would you use for easy and quick leveling?
---
I’ll be back online in like an hour
---
Stash and build budget. I realized I spent as much time micromanaging inventory as playing. A mule would require even more time investment in management, and therefor less time actually playing. I don’t have the time to invest in working on a game just to make playing it feasible.
---
I had to get creative on my 2 layer camp that goes over a cliff edge,
---
I also had to add 2 signs to the path, one says Use the Stairs
---
the other, Do not take the shortcut.
---
I had one guy message me and say that was entirely on Him. 
---
Its the Lead Acid Cliff, I'm not moving it. Please stop taking the shortcut and plummeting to your death. And if you do please pick up your Tombstones, Skullpiles, Doctors bag, Present box, Pot o golds, and Paper sacks. Thanks!
---
I probably should add the 2 chests at the top. If I can its kind of tricky just getting both Resource Extractors and the Colectron set up.
---
That's amazing, I'm actually looking for a better flamer myself. Mine has 50% limb dmg, better in vats, and dmg resist while aiming. Not the best, but it's alright. Definitely jealous lol
---
Working adult = earn wages = money no problem to buy the last few ranks if you must complete 😁
---
For the 1st time the other day my boss was a 3* still level 40 i think but that was a nice change of pace. I remeber people talking about this event changing and that you cant really do that anymore. But i tried it the other day during that same one and they seemed to keep spawning without any noise needed. You just gota hope the event doesnt die out on you, thats a weird bug
---
Bloodied benefits everything, really.
---
The thing about melee is that while you deal a lot of damage, the time-to-kill for any given *mob* is pretty terrible because you have to approach each one manually, whereas a gunner can just pick everyone off at a safe distance.
---
It's great against a single heavily-armored target, though, like the Scorchbeast Queen or a Sheepsquatch.
---
But to be perfectly frank, with so many hacked guns out there, you could do Bloodied melee and feasibly lose out on the SBQ or Encryptid because they'll kill them dead (or for the former, in the air) before you can ever get in range of them.
---
Frog legs is a gimmick, you'll get way more survivability out of taking goat legs and being able to make quick escapes off buildings and cliffs. Frog legs just makes an easy target for complaints because if anyone as much as leaves the ground once before killing you it's obviously because they are a cheating bunny hopping bastard and not just better than you.
---
haha thanks.  im thinking of selling actually.  u on ps4? im in the market for 556 flux or caps.  or nice leather armor
---
&gt;  We're talking about that as a future improvement 
---
You should really press the devs to go all in on it, and make it possible!  
---
The repeatable challenge of 100 points per 10k exp is not really engaging.
---
I’m glad you’re on the forum reading the feedback good looks 👀.
---
You're *supposed* to gain XP from events, but due to a current bug it's not giving any XP from any events whatsoever
---
And u are a responder? I like Raiders more and more.
---
I see...
---
I'm level 120 or so and do have a variety of perks, but I do know it's gonna take quite a bit to get everything reallocated. I'd rather not start a new character given everything I've accomplished so far, but I'll see what's realistic when I get the chance to tally up just how many points I'll need.
---
I appreciate the tip about the Perk Loadout Manager. Will be taking a look at that soon.
---
If thats your argument why can't I exchange a high damage round for more of a low damage round? Why does converting 100 rounds of .50 get me 80 points? Not even enough to get 18 .38 rounds. Shouldn't a larger higher damage round yield enough to make multiple lower rounds?
---
I think they should have done it as material from broken down rounds as opposed to points, like if you were actually reloading ammo.
---
Alright, had to do a bit of math before I tried explaining this.
---
The gold scrap appears to be used in fallout for completing things that would need circuitry.
---
Let's be extremely generous and say there's as much gold in a fallout circuit as there is in a PC motherboard.
---
Approx 2000 PC motherboard = 5 oz gold.
---
Fallout crafting recipe average 3 gold for recipe.
---
6000 scrap for 5oz gold.
---
400oz gold in a bullion bar.
---
420,000 gold scrap in a bullion bar.
---
Get harvesting.
---
Not going to lie, that's a pretty meager boost.  Have them set the repeatable weekly to benefit from X2 as well.
---
I knew it. I'm doing a lot less damage on my first hits too.
---
No, this shouldn't be possible. Xbox players will play with Xbox players, and PC players will play with PC players.
---
well normally i'd say melee to save ammo. But i can hook you up wit loads of ammo. probably a hunting rifle and then something for close encounters. Or a pipe rifle. Faster firing.
---
Just hit me up on here or xbox when you're on.
---

 &gt; No, this shouldn't be possible. Xbox players will play with Xbox players, and PC players will play with PC players.
---
just scroll past them. there isnt that much to talk about with this patch, and the ammo converter was one of the few things people were hyped for and it turned out remarkably bad, people are going to talk about it.
---
and it take a monumental amount of noise to even get bethesda to even acknowledge an issue, let alone fix it.
---
They probably had planned to just have the ammo spinner of the machine. But something went wrong or broke and they threw in the computer. The computer is not even in the icon in the board.
---
Thanks 
---
PSN packattack12382
---
It's only going to be for the dailies, so it's probably going to net you 1 extra rank up in total.
---
As a sound guy: Please dont tap the mic :( I promise it's on.
---
Also, idk where this stereotype of high school kids having infinite time came from cause I sure as hell didnt. I was busier then than I was in college. And my sister, my god. Before COVID I barely I got to see the poor girl cause it's as if she is running the school or something.
---
Its even better than most power armors, lol
---
Sit on the computer to prevent this
---
I commend you for your honesty and willingness to give it back
---
So any Junkies/Medics/Stalkers or Instigating miniguns will be magic regardless of prefixes? I watched the angry turtle video but didn’t quite get it
---
I had an issue last night on PC. Everytime i picked scrap or something up I heard a beeping noise. It was driving me crazy so I logged off.
---
If it's a fix that requires a client side update then don't hold your breath on seeing anything until the next mainline update. Hotfixes cost time and money and are reserved for things that are game breaking rather than things that are just broken.
---
no cross pollination allowed!
---
Psn cenafun12
---
Literally just press Escape
---
Apparently you also can't expect them to deliver an enjoyable endgame, a stable functioning game or stuff players want to purchase.
---
I've been to your Camp, very nice. I still like my Tree House by Thunder Mountain. That Character is just going to live there permanently
---
This sounds about right actually
---
Gamepass just supports both console *and* pc downloads now...we peasants have no worries.
---
Ah I see. Ok thank you.
---
I'd never seen that before Wastelanders, so I figured it was something new, especially since I can loot some bodies for a while while others have turned into paper bags immediately.
---
"If you already play Fallout 76 on PC and decide to make the jump to Game Pass for PC, all of the progress you’ve made will still be waiting for you as soon as you log into the game."
---
That's the bit that's getting me though. Sounds like pc players can port over to xbox?
---
Edit, not sure how gamepass works. Could just be me being thick. Thank you for the response
---
If you dont mind do the team up thing.use a fast gun and tag every enemy you will level up way fast.just dont be the frontline guy
---
Are you sure yours didnt reward early like quite a few others have noticed?
---
I had quite a few reward score at 3/5 completion vs getting score at the end.
---
If you track the challenges it makes it easy to see when you get the reward vs before you were expecting too.
---
Do you know if it’s capped? Like if I somehow got 50 intelligence would I benefit from that? Or is it capped at a certain number
---
agree - ever since the patch, i've been joining random public teams every time and I play and sometimes I create one and people join me right away. it's the best.
---
Right, need to stop playing NW now then.  
---
If they add NW in as another score award I don't want to have to spend too long getting the next level.  
---
Thanks.
---
Funny thing... since my last comment I got my first kill in nuclear winter ever.
---
It was actually pretty goddamn horrible... I ran past one of those high tier boxes and grabbed a gauss rifle and marine armor out of it for some odd reason and hid in a bush. Some naked player walked past my bush and I shot them in the back with the gauss rifle and they instantly got downed. I tried to finish them off but it took like three shots to finally kill them.
---
It actually made me feel like I was doing something horribly and morally wrong just shooting that player in the back and then shooting them when they were down, I felt disgusted with myself. I dunno how y’all find this shite fun.
---
Then I saw another player wander by and got downed and killed by some other dude, who immediately started tea bagging the guy he just killed.
---
...I felt a little less bad about shooting him in the back and killing him.
---
This happened to me as well yesterday, lost 1k SCORE as well 
---

---
I won't login until next 20-30 minutes.
---
Ever wonder why the word “Escape” was capitalized in my post? 😉
---
It's double SCORE only on the dailies, still a small boost, but not anything major.
---
Thank God legendary perks got pushed all the way back to patch 22. Considering they seemed all but ready for release on the pts that actually suggests they're likely going back to the drawing board with all the feedback and they might not entirely suck as much when we next see them.
---
Not  for everyone. 
---
More and more people are experiencing this auto completion bug again. The 250 points is from doing 1 daily. With the two weeklies, the score would be a lot different if they counted.
---
Gotcha so game pass is not only an xbox thing then? On pc its just another launcher or whatever? Kinda like how steam happened?
---
That's because you're used to the clunky, limiting mechanics.
---
and better yet your encouraged to be afk as you get more exp for not doing anything but staying in the match to the end, actually killing other combatants gives crap for xp
---
I drink and eat XP boosting aids items constantly and so far I've jumped up the SCORE pretty quickly for as little time as I play.
---
wait, seriously?! 
---
so that's why I didn't get my 1000 score for building camp stuff, wasted it...that just makes me feel awesome /s &gt;_&lt;
---
edit: 
---
wait, unless that was a bug, I mean you're supposed to get the score from the weekly's you complete, right? It never gave me the 1000 for that one
---
Pretty sure it just works for them like us as a remote download for the free stuff and purchases.
---
Yeah, once I found out that was repeatable, I join a public team, get bonded for xp buff, use inspiration and leader bobble and roll out 3 levels in an hour for level gain weekly.
---
It specifically says double dailies, which is good. If it's double weeklies too they'd be better off starting the event on tuesday otherwise people will be upset they accidently complete a weekly before the event is active.
---
I have 8 mules over on ESO. It's not fun having to rearrange the furniture every time you want something.  It's like voluntarily giving yourself umpteen loading screens.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by a basement ladder, is that something new or were they built in an existing location? I have a bunch of yellow crates hidden under my house between the foundation walls in a secret area where i placed my fermenter and moonshine still, hidden behind a nuka cola secret door. Was it like that?
---
yeah, sounds spot on.
---
Not to mention that we cannot even log a ticket right now as Bethesda Support is "under maintenance".  [https://help.bethesda.net/](https://help.bethesda.net/)
---
Coolcoolcool thanks for the clarification!
---
Line in the sand is a blast with a full server, as is uranium fever.   I’m a bit dismayed that a lot of teams have no idea how to maximize xp or complete events.  One Violent Night is an even bigger shit show than before.  An entire team comes in and jumps on instruments.    I try to protect them but they die.  They respawn and go right back to a jazz quartet.  Die again.  Another team shows up and runs around outside flailing around, getting killed, crying for help.  I find it all  hilarious.   Quartet plays a god damn half hour set with only respawn breaks........and still never draws out the night stalker?  What?  Yes.  I can’t explain it.
---
Same here:  https://imgur.com/a/jWt2Bin
---
was very disappointed to learn that they could not be used in NW. i already have a ghillie suit i can put over any armor i want, why would i grind to make armor look like it ?
---
If only this would work.  Pretty obvious nobody is actually looking at the existing posts before adding another one for the same exact thing yet again.  
---
On my reddit app the screen only shows about 5 posts before you need to start scrolling down and at one point every single one I could see was for this same thing.
---
Oof got the same idea as you.
---
No problem at all and you're welcome!
---
Yes, you need to lvl up! You are not meant to do The entire main story in one go.
---
I was being facetious.
---
It removes a lot of incentive to build stairs or place camps.
---
It allows people to flee the zone or close the gap on other players.
---
Look at Sutton. If you don't have Frog, you have limited options for reaching high ground. A squad can cover all those points and defend it. With froggy, you can jump on greebles and pop up on a flank in seconds.
---
It should have stayed as a mutation
---
Wandering around that area searching!  BOOM. Found it!!! Thank You!!  Not far South/Southeast of Site Alpha, halfway between Big Fred's BBQ Shack  and National Isolated Radio Array.
---
Scorchbeast if your taking on that bat rank up fireproof perk and it will only tickle you on that sonic blast it does.decent gun will take care of the rest
---
Sorry - by charging I meant holding the button down for the shot to fully charge.  They fixed that bug with the latest patch when before it shot the full charge damage just tapping the button.  This makes it more challenging but I get it.  It's the actual play bugs that are horrible
---
good for you, I'm getting disconnect each 30 mim
---
At least they dont add 'fixed flying bush in the middle of the dense empty forest outside the map borders' and 'added missing dots during conversation with stranded cat in the middle of nowhere' anymore. Now they prefer lies.
---
True, but it still cuts out 3 days of dailies you have to do, helps catch up if you were behind.
---
According to Mr. Turtle (the Angry one), the "magic" happens under the following conditions:
---
- Fire rate required (~200), plus Prefix OR Major (note OR, not both - having both doesn't improve the magic at all)
---
- Prefix
---
  - Instigating
---
  - Junkie's
---
  - Medic's
---
  - Stalker's
---
- Major
---
  - +33% vats hit chance
---
  - +50% limb damage
---
  - +40% bash damage
---
There is a caveat for Explosive or Beam split weapons in that it can bring the effective hit rate above the ~200 threshold (explosions or split beams count as additional hits on their own). This works for most enemies except for the SBQ who is immune to Explosive damage.
---
Edit: I've personally observed (and use) the effect with a primed Bloodied / +33 vhc / LMG that has a fire rate of 159... so the ~200 threshold seems to vary a bit
---
(this was my first login on day 1)
---
Same issue here, lost out on 2k experience. Bethesda support is extremely *helpful* with this issue, their first reply was that it was the 3/5 bug (it's not, the screenshot clearly shows that, the explanation clearly explained it) and then the second reply "Oh we're sorry, we can't help you" and directed me to leave feedback, because we all know they lsiten to feedback, hah.
---
Store the floor or foundation they snapped to and it will remove the stairs too
---
removal of the limit to points you can have would help, removal of all the limits in the game would help a ton as well
---
I faintly remember seeing it for ps4 but not sure if it was atoms or not. I buy them a bunch for my better half.
---
Not that I've seen. You'll get to keep them they've said, obviously, but not when this will get fixed.
---
If you've got time but not to play, it's not unviable to load up and just hide where you spawn until you die. It's fairly AFK farmable while you watch Netflix or do some chores.
---
If you're on PC, or can otherwise stream your setup to your phone, you can even do it remotely. I stream my desktop to my phone at work and just keep queuing up for more matches.
---
I have HUGE paranoia thinking I'm gonna drop my legacy or fixer or whatever I'm using somehow.
---
it's so bad I check my favorites wheel like every 7 mins 😂
---
 Not for the dailies that are auto completing if you are logged in during the challenge reset time: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges\_autocompleted\_on\_login\_with\_link\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges_autocompleted_on_login_with_link_to/)

I lost 750 SCORE yesterday, I won't login until the next 20-30 minutes just to stay on the safe side.
---
This is not the same as people being confused with the weeklies awarding SCORE at 3/5 :(
---
Tbh things like this, colored ash piles, beam recolors and explosion vfx are an entirely untapped Mtx market.
---
ya i made a post about it too, and got down voted for it. i know i bought that pack but its still gone
---
Burning out on fomo is a personal problem. Individuals need to recognize the psycology behind their plan and simply accept the reality.
---
All games die in 3-4 years. All that time spent grinding wont matter after the next best game. Just gotta step back and see the bigger picture.
---
You act like 90% of all F76 PvP players, pretentious idiots who think they achieved something.  
---
Btw, I don't hate PvP. PvP can be really good, if done right.  
---
And F76 PvP just sucks. A good PvP system doesn't need a Damage Limit.
---
Nope. Cosmetic only
---
I know, I had to do something to try and prevent that going on until a patch
---
Don't worry got you covered :)
---
For cryolator.
---
Yeah you're SOL. Support won't help you. (already tried) 
---
Lots of people are reporting challenges auto completed.
---
same here 3/7 after resett
---
You got to be fucking shitting me, I though that at least they can give the points! I am back to working normally, I don't have much time to play this damn game and I'm really worried that if I keep encountering bugs like this -- I will not make it to 100 without paying despite my efforts...
---
Wait....what am I missing here?
---
"It is very simple: more choice is better than less choice."
---
That's a value assessment. More choice is not inherently better than less choice. In some cases, more choice can be overwhelming. You're trying to establish a basic principle here and it just doesn't work, and has nothing to do with 'math'. Just because you throw in the words 'more' and 'less' doesn't suddenly mean it's math, lol.
---
"Less grind is better than more grind." Less grind is not inherently better than more grind. Plenty of players love grind, and enjoy having more grind to do to keep themselves occupied. Entire games are built around this. Again, you're trying to set up your personal opinions as basic principles that should just be accepted. You open with rhetoric like "it's very simple" to try to strengthen your case, the same way you use the word 'objectively' as a form of rhetoric to strengthen your case. Neither add any value to your argument.
---
You write that these 'are not up for debate'. You have closed yourself off to counterpoint just by writing that. You are, once again, attempting to make your personal desires somehow universal or objective. 
---
You do not understand what objectivity means in the context of entertainment.
---
Here are some examples of correct use of 'objectively':
---
A Robertson or square-headed screwdriver for a star-headed screw is an objectively bad tool for the job, because no matter who attempts to use it, it will not function properly. 
---
A 20 mile walk is objectively longer than a 10 mile walk, because no matter who is walking, one will take longer than the other.
---
There are specific, universal, unchangeable things we can see about these two situations, with measurable qualities we can clearly define. Hence through comparisons we can make objective statements.
---
Entertainment is not like this. The goal of entertainment is to entertain, so there is no mathematical basis. If someone gets enjoyment out of a novel or song or game-- or a particular aspect of such, as we're discussing here-- then the function of having given entertainment is complete, and it is not possible to say that the thing is objectively bad. You can describe it as poorly made or you can describe it as lacking fun, but that's still a personalized value judgement, and the minute someone else says "I had fun" then you can no longer claim objectivity over that value judgement. It is not universal, it is not outside of the scope of personal assessment with subjective criteria. 
---
Applying 'objectively bad' to entertainment is disregarding the entire purpose of the word and the broad contexts of art and enjoyment in general, which are not rigidly defined.
---
If you can't process that then god help you because no one else can. :)
---
That's right where I am and I've completed all dailies for day 1 and 2, plus all weeklies except kill 10 legendaries.
---
For the level challeneges themselves, a new charavter might be faster. For the repeating XP, the higher level character would be better.
---
it says cyro cell
---
I’m on Xbox*
---
Wait.. this perk card isn't working? Excuse my ignorance but I've taken a short hiatus from the game.. I use adrenaline for one of my main points of doing damage..
---
Can we get one event that is mistress of mysteries related?  Or something? Anything? They are supposed to be counted as a faction right? They originally were a faction inthe beginning of the game.
---
The quest line was one of my favorites, and after its done, its like they never existed.
---
Give us a reason to go back to the mansion, a plan or two for new secret spy equipment that is useful past level 45.
---
Idk, I feel like they are so forgotten that asking for anything is to much with everything else going on.
---
Same here

Logging in before / close to the time the daily challenges reset seems to cause it for some people, I lost 750 SCORE yesterday due to that issue :(
---
I submitted a ticket to Bethesda, I'dd suggest you do the same, they need to know.
---
Happened to me this morning too. Really disappointing.
---
Complete an event, level up, and the gold star challenge auto completed.
---
Cryo is spelled wrong.
---
When I do have the sound, the noise of the workbenchs always bugs and I keep hearing it off of the workbench so... I feel ya. It's very annoying.
---
Shoots the tears of your enemies
---
Eh, I run both, Junkies is easier than bloodied.
---
Will be the site of my new camp!
---
this is dope, was hoping someone would do this! thanks.
---
the only thing im worried about is the board being segmented into "chapters." im concerned that they are going to have bumps in required SCORE at these checkpoints greater than just +25. is there anyone out there that has hit rank 35+ yet? i believe that is the end of the first chapter.
---
I had the same exact thing happen. I was playing Adventure mode when they updated. https://imgur.com/a/pdtWwF8
---
No keep it
---
Okay, someone else clued me in.  Maybe I'm dyslexic.  At least they finally fixed some of their messed up loading screen tips after a year and a half.
---
Hmmm what is the Appalachia starter pack?
---
Thank you. This has 20 up votes by people so oblivious they didn’t even know this.
---
not anymore you dont..
---
I am getting 5k per queen event. We do 6 of those in about 2hrs.
---
Gotcha.  Butt-mcstuffins up above clued me in.
---
I got 5/5 and didn’t get ANY
---
Yeah... getting xp is a huge grind with how they've set it up. I have been doing that. But I don't think I could bother with getting 35000 xp (what you need to do the xp boost you need + whatever to get the 250 score the NW gives you nevermind any random daily else I might want to skip). Run and gun is when you aren't sneaking and taking your shots carefully so as not to get discovered and just going and shooting everything that comes at you (I must be getting old, run and gun used to be a common phrase for that). Great for people who want more reflex type gameplay and are good at it. I prefer sneaking and using strategy to get my way around. Which is slower, requires more patience, and just doesn't work on some events (basically ones with a lot of mobs that just spawn and tend to instantly home in on you once one sees you). My build is made to be sneaky but it's not all that sturdy (and I suck at run and gun so if I get found and rushed at by a lot of mobs I usually die cause I can't kill them quick enough... doesn't help my build is made around a sniper rifle and getting that one really good hit in). 
---
Anyways, I don't think it's much to ask Bethesda not to balance the pass so that you have to do every single daily plus the repeat daily (which is very stingy... 100 score for 10,000 xp? for some of us that 10k takes a long time, and it's usually the same people who don't like stuff like pvp). I am not asking they make it super quick to finish, just forgiving of missing some dailies and maybe even a few weeklies. And not requiring NW (which a lot of playerbase just doesn't enjoy. I really don't think people should have to go do something they don't like just to get a few points. The point of playing a game is to have fun, not be forced into things you don't enjoy). And not requiring NW doesn't mean they have to take the dailies away... they could just balance it so those are extra points so those who do like it or are willing to try it can progress a little faster. Basically the pass should be balanced so people can be a little choosy on what they do to advance it (or at least have the leeway to skip the more odious stuff they really don't want to do).
---
Or hell, don't even balance the pass around dailies. Maybe make it events and experience based. That way people can really pick and choose how htey want to advance the season pass. I mean supposedly people play Bethesda games cause it allows for them to play how they want....
---
Honestly I don't even know why they offer the other linings, it's just a waste of Gold lol
---
There is an issue where weeklies award the SCORE at 3/5 completion, not when the challenge is actually completed :(
---
We don't even get Legendaries
---
No. Pc has gamepass also. They are saying pc will port to pc game pass
---
So, those legendary effects I listed and angry turtle has on the thumbnail make any heavyweapon magical if it has over 200 firerate. 
---
For the gauss minigun specificly, you can easily get the +200 firerate thanks to the explosive properties that gauss miniguns have. You just need either the tri or penta barrel. As I said, I think the tri is better because it doesnt penalize damage.
---
My bloodied swing speed weight reduction shovel?!
---
I clear that daily quest with style.
---
Same here, didn't even get any score from destroying robots :l what a joke
---
What a shit show.
---
This pitch was so good, I'm looking to see if I can run 76 on my half-dead laptop just so I can toss them caps...
---
What! So you’re saying I could have already received it?
---
And there's also a bug where challenges auto complete without awarding anything.  https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
I'm on pc unfortunately, otherwise I definitely would be interested
---
Damn. Wtf? What system are you on?
---
I had a different issue, it gave me the score before I finished the final objective.
---
Look at it this way: you're in your car on the highway and there's a speed limit. You're driving at that speed limit. xD (Yeah, I know, you could go over the speed limit there, but you get the point.)
---
Seriously though, adding SCORE reward to events would dissolve most of this frustration, but good luck getting them to listen. :/ Until then... take a deep breath and do something else, I suppose. I feel for you, but there's not much else we can do about it, having shared our opinions here already.
---
Same here.
---
Thanks for the tip, gonna load up remote play on my phone, thanks!
---
I know I forsure bush wookied a couple matches yesterday while mowing the lawn.
---
I have had to change my build so many times because of perk cards not working. I think my break from the game might be longer this time.
---
No kidding. Interesting. Better than not receiving it
---
Same here yesterday

---
Damn no Steel dawn until April 2021?
---
Well now that's a good argument. Can't fault that side of the logic.
---
Materials would be *ok* but then we're creating loose sellable materials and that could have a negative effect on the economy, since lead/plastic/steel can all be sold in bulk to vendors but crafted rounds can't.
---
No, they’re saying if you’ve played a PC version before, that progress will be reflected on the Xbox Game Pass for PC/Microsoft Store PC version, not that it applies to normal Xbox Game Pass/Xbox version
---
I applaud you for this. I make the mistake of just spamming O till I remember it doesn’t work like that.
---
It's unbelievable. I'm never gonna get to 100 with things like this happening. Honestly, the season was the only thing making me play the game, if stuff like that continues to happen, then I'll probably just find a different game. Sick of the frustration.
---
Same here yesterday  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges\_autocompleted\_on\_login\_with\_link\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges_autocompleted_on_login_with_link_to/)
---
I know what run and gun means. I don’t know what it has to do with the conversation at hand.
---
FYI public events should also give score even if they aren’t right now and there will be double score weekends coming up per the community calendar.
---
Anyway if you don’t find the seasons fun I would encourage you to do whatever you did in the game for fun before they launched.
---
Made it myself after seeing the "friendly fire" perk. The shishkebab actually works with friendly fire which is awesome
---
The Inspirational perk stacks now?
---
What level are you??
---
If you kill everything except the hoard boss they respawn forever, never pick up another clipboard again for springs. Im sitting on over 1.5k springs
---
Yup, my dailies did that to me yesterday  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges\_autocompleted\_on\_login\_with\_link\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges_autocompleted_on_login_with_link_to/)
---
Oh damn, your weeklys too?
---
I think you should cut back on the Daddy-o.
---
Bethesda.
---
Dammit.
---
You could try and start it up again by setting up a sign saying to contact you directly for new player aid kits. That way, you can verify that it's going to a low level every time.
---
Haha
---
The tune appears whenever your top left of your screen show a message? It's a weird bug that can be fixed by rejoining server
---
Since wastelanders legendary npcs and ghouls now drop all their loot when they despawn for you to freely pick up such as legendaries. They dont even have to be from your legendary kill, then can be from someone who didnt loot it from the corpse.
---
Fuck. That sucks.
---
Did you put in a ticket, and get a response/points that were missing added to your total?
---
And which platform?
---
I don't drive my car for fun, i don't spend hundreds of hours on the road, yes there is a speed limit but if my car can't damage your car i think its safe to say the limit is useless.
---
Dont we know them already? They are boring.
---
The foundations were part of the problem. They wouldn't store either
---
my mistake. i missed your portion on only having to do the repeatable once per day.
---
I am starting to really hate this game, I don't know if I will even bother. I made a bug report on the forums, that's it. The amount of unfixed shit is stupidly high.
---
I didn't read the dude's name and i thought "Butt-mcstuffins" was some sort of an insult like you're calling him a smartass 😂😂
---
Happy to help!
---
I do enjoy playing it as a post-apocalyptic hide and seek when I get time but the levels and these grinds just drag on sometimes. Being able to farm it for hours while I'm at work helps a bunch.
---
Well I mean instead of whining you could just get the badges yourself.
---
What does BE25 and B2525 stand for?
---
I’ve said before.  If the grind is making you not play but you like the game?  STOP CHASING THE CARROT.  
---
With the bullion/rep grind I gave up on it weeks ago.   The game became enjoyable again. I play to play not to do chores.  
---
Same thing with these seasons.  I have the time to grind but I refuse to.  I rather just play game and enjoy myself.  
---
I like cosmetics and some other perks it gives but its not worth my time.  I rather just play the game.  If I manage to unlock any score points I take it as a plus.   
---
Don’t let FOMO dictate your enjoyment.
---
We simply do not have the tools to assist with this issue.  -Bethesda
---
I do the same, and add that I hop at the locations the responder vendor spawns. just in case I can grab a hunter long coat while I'm already hopping servers so much.
---
If public events gave score that would settle my issue. Except Bethesda hasn't clarified and we don't know that. It could be what they meant is that there will be dailies/weeklies that give score for doing it (like the daily that is do 3 events and get score). And the fact they are staying silent and not saying, "ooops, guys, it's a bug, we're looking into it" has me very worried it's the latter because otherwise, why let people get this worked up and not clarifiying if you have a easy way to calm them down (vs. that's how it is, deal with it... at that point, better to stay silent than feed the anger).
---
Me too. I wonder if it's a bug that can affect other allies
---
See you when the BOS reach Appalachia.
---
Hmm the Hunts' corporation will consider this.
---
Support said they won't/can't restore points. Though maybe if enough people flood them with complaints, they'll pull their thumbs from their collective asses and fix this.
---
Don't often share my own stuff here as it seems tacky - but basically everyone has their maths wrong. I did a video [here](https://youtu.be/UUnOYA-jFrI), but I'll summarise:
---
* They say '**[around 10 weeks](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6gFSDSYkcGiWk1FspNzvZZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-kicking-off-season-one)**' and '**[mid-September](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons)**' for the end date. Not specifically 10 weeks. 
---
* The Monday before the mid-month Tuesday restart is the 14th September. That's **76 days** or **10 weeks and 6 days**. As someone pointed out on my video, *I see what you did there Bethesda*. 
---
Your math is good, but it's actually missing the extra 6 days and extra 'game week' (as we'd get 11 game weeks, just the last one is shorter).
---
Also, you actually only need to gain 99 levels, not 100 (as you start on Lvl 1 and the first 1k is to Lvl 2)
---
Here's the maths:
---
Total required score: **220275**
---
Score from 76 days of dailies: **152000**
---
Score from 11 weeks of weeklies: **82500**
---
Total earned: **234500**
---
**234500** minus **220275** = **14225**.
---
so that's a grace period of over 14k. 
---
That's **42** dailies that you can skip and still hit 100 (14225/2000=7.1, rounded down to 7, that's 42 dailies as each day has 6).
---
Also, Bethesda have recently confirmed there will be double score weekends, so there's even more to gain.
---
I put in a ticket, there is a pre-made message that states that Bethesda won't add points back to your account, but it think the more people put in tickets the better.
---
You may want to wait until you hit level 50 (if you aren't) before spending scrip on new legendaries, that way you get the max level weapon, which will last you longer if it's a good one.  
---
If you're dying a lot, you may need to tweak your build.  There are some great guides if you search the forum.
---
That sucks. And it is a big deal because there is no room for error in the terrible way they are scoring Seasons.
---
I started playing the game about 3 months ago and was amazed at how much fun I had. Tons of problems with the game, but tons of fun. I did all my grinding, got two characters over level 100, and then just stopped. There's zero incentive for me to come back, there's no reason for me to treat this like a live service game because it utterly fails at the live service aspect. There's no challenge, no sense of progression. The Season/Score thing almost got my attention but when I realized I'd have to put the disc in and bore myself with it every single day I noped right out. Maybe I could dedicate one day a week. Maybe. I have too many other, more enjoyable, games I'd rather be playing.
---
Yup, I brought this up a while ago too.  It’s rather annoying to have to visit either Crater or Foundation before going to Vault 79.
---
Hahahhahahhahahha you're so way off the mark it's not even funny.
---
I did too, I still laughed.
---
S'all good, it was a longish post. :p
---
The observatory? Bcs I found nothing
---
This bug will never go away and the next season will launch without a fix and probably with no acknowledgement of this happening.
---
Thanks for asking this question, how could they make it clearer one wonders  🤷‍♂️
---
Oh, and when I mentioned run and gun, it's a faster way of getting xp. So if you like running and gunning xp may come quick to you. But when you are taking your time taking a town down... xp is a lot slower to build.
---
Step 1. Whip out your pipboy.
---
Step 2. Select the ammo you don't use.
---
Step 3. Drop it.
---
I'll see you again when Winter Season comes out.
---
Exactly. This post is not helpful at all in addressing the main concern which is how bad the system is. I don’t have high hopes on BGS fixing this stupid take on a season pass but I’m still looking at that glimmer of hope that they do.
---
Nah by then, there will be way too many other games vying for my attention.
---
I hear that place gets attacked by scorchbeasts alot
---
If they change the progression system maybe, but if they keep it the same I won't be back.
---
So I’m at rank 9 all but one weekly complete, missed half of day 1 dailies and the NW one yesterday. So being one level behind what seems to be average level it gives me hope I’ll get to the end. I honestly don’t care about most of the rewards I just like completing things. Oh and the ammo converter blows.
---
I get that they want to make the season rewards a challenge, and you should have to log in quite regularly and put in quite a lot of time.
---
But EVERY single challenge, EVERY single week plus extra XP grinding, just to reach 100? 
---
How the fuck are making these decisions?! Have they never played a game before, somehow think that that level dedication required just becomes a chore
---
They said they are delaying them to make improvements so hopefully they are substantial ones.
---
!remindme 6 months
---
I disagree with you there. I’m a sneaky sniper and get a lot of xp. Especially with new team buffs and lunch boxes.
---
Dude have an up vote, great add.  To bad I am on PS4
---
I fully agree. Honestly sometimes it feels like Bethesda is actively trying to kill the fanbase with crap like this
---
Man I kind of want to help out and do this on ps4
---
You would of without realising
---
Meat Week?
---
Yeah it sucks. But I think the more people put in tickets the more likely they are to find some sort of solution to the issue. I was very frustrated yesterday.
---
From what people are saying, you will want to avoid logging in during the before / close to / at the time of daily challenges reset. 
---
I haven't logged in today yet, I will give it a try in a bit, hoping none of my challenges have auto completed.
---
Bloodied explosive 25% faster fire rate and bloodied 25% faster fire rate 25% less AP cost
---
I think he’s the one who keeps making those monkeys that keep giving away my position!
---
They said it will he repeatable. My guess is the xp weekly will swap to public events every other week
---
Their communications are pretty poor. I agree
---
No, not the dumbs! :(
---
It's the icing on the cake of their already "log in for 15-30min a day" model.
---
Daily limits, 1 or 2 daily quests, already heavily encouraged this imo. The profession of this season pass is just absolutely the icing on this cake though.
---
I really wish they (and the industry as a whole) would drop this idea of getting players to log in daily. Let folks grind out the gear in a unhealthy 48hour marathon session if they want to ffs. 
---
Anyone that is bothered that Player Z has the endgame stuff because they don't have a job and grinded it out in a week can just do the same themselves if they really want to. That's not what it's about of course, it's about daily login metrics and making it look like people are playing but having to log in every day and I really don't like it.
---
Events that spawn enemies can sometimes be a pain.
---
I have a character that needs to do "Cop a squatter" usually 3 or 4 times before I can actually complete it. Other character completes it the first time, every time.
---
Only solution is to server hop and hope for a good spawn.
---
This all speculation, but im curious if enemies dont somehow spawn in instanced or underground spaces under where they are actually supposed to spawn.
---
p i p e   i s   l i f e
---
Aye, haven't logged in yet today, don't even want to know if it fucked up more.

I play alot, thats the problem. The daily score cycle makes it so you have to wait to get it, sure ill get 10k xp here or there but thats just 100 points. I want to grind for it, but i cant because of the daily cycle. The problem is there isnt ENOUGH to do to get score, I enjoy the game, not the restrictions.
---
My biggest gripe is that it pretty much forces you to log in every day if you want to have a chance at tier 100. Ive never seen any other online game do that before. 
---
When a game feels more like a chore than a game its time to move on. And seasons was the breaking point for me.
---
Or a dense chest mod
---
Cryolator so forgettable that Bethesda doesn’t even know how to spell its ammo correctly 😔
---
"They say 'around 10 weeks' and 'mid-September' for the end date."
---
I don't know if they changed their projections with the ITV today, but what I read from Bethesda was that the season would last 10 weeks with a two week resting period between. That was the initial message, so if that's still corect, then your assumption that S2 will be on the 14th is off-- it would be on the 22nd (Patch 22 on the 22!)
---
That said, if Bethesda has updated their projections with new specifics, I'm open to correction (preferably through a link for my own benefit).
---
And I'm not sure why a couple of you have stated that I used 100 ranks-- I did start on rank 2 haha. Did I write something that suggests otherwise? I'm pretty sure I stated 220k is the going number to earn.
---
Oh man this could be a such a good farm. Need to drag it next time
---
So you're quitting because of something you don't have to take part in? Alrighty then.
---
It's a reward for those who DO log in daily and do the "challenges". If that's not you then why moan about it? Just ignore it and get whatever you can by just playing the game the way you want to. 
---
I have honestly never seen anyone complain about doing daily stuff for any other game because those people are like 'i cannot or don't want to log in daily so that's okay'
---
Having to play the game in a specific way in order to circumvent bugs is asinine. My frustration keeps escalating the more I think about it.
---
This bug has existed since forever in NW, they should have fixed the code by now to prevent this from occurring.
---
Oh wow, those would be some amazing weapons.
---
Been that way since at the very least 5am EST
---
I hit them up on Twitter.
---
i didnt quit.. my build is just completely broken so unless I spend all my time in the west i cant play
---
No need to get so angry. Did you do NW first?
---
I was wondering if this bug would still be in. I figured there was no way, surely they would fix it amidst rolling out a new system like this right? Of course it's still bugged lmao
---
For details sake, have you played Nuclear Winter at all in the last 24hours and were you playing when the daily reset happened?
---
In 6 months cyberpunk is out and the new consoles. I'll find plenty of other things to do.
---
I also lost all my Christmas Emotes and all of my camera roll in game. Did this happen to everyone too?
---
damn.  oh well. good luck in the wasteland!
---
Definitely boring cards. Just more meta stuff.
---
I'd like to see more QOL stuff and ideas to buff some of the non meta perks and effects. 
---
Hopefully it's a huge improvement over the crap the showed us before.
---
Tagging u/ladydevann, this issue is happening to more than just me [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges\_autocompleted\_on\_login\_with\_link\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjfdv1/challenges_autocompleted_on_login_with_link_to/)
---
It's like they want you to log in every day but only for 20 minutes...
---
I don't know if the that's the best approach for footfall in the atomic shop, but I imagine that's what they're optimising for.
---
Oh all Hunts' brand Adventure kits™ are FREE to eligible customers and come with the Ragstag knife skin as part of the kit. Also we we would be more than happy to provide the an adventure kit to higher level customers however we would like to inform you that the kit is designed for lower levels characters and would not include the treasure hunter outfit. If you still wish to purchase one please private message this account for further details.
---
What about the 0/5 build stairts weekly?
---
No, just logged on about 20 minutes after reset.
---
Angry?  Im fucking pissed, delay after delay,  bug after bug, MTX after MTX.
---
I think they should have took a look at the way Warframe do their Nightwave (effectively the season pass) and copied the "catch up mechanic". Missed a day of doing dailies? Once you've done that days you can do the previous day's so you don't feel the pressure to log in every day.
---
With that said I don't understand these posts. You can just play the game and ignore this completely.
---
Well i wouldn't go that far and say that, as power armor have hidden 42% passive damage reduction effect (and 90% radiation damage reduction) on them on top of all the normal DR/ER/RR. Depends on legendary effects i would say. if you by some magic got yourself a full set of unyielding/sentinel SS armors with some nifty effect like increased ap regen, then we can say it is better :)
---
ammo Smith + super duper will help a little
---
I remember it being somewhere in the savage divide... I’m sorry that’s probably not helpful, but I do remember the location you’re talking about being there.
---
Don’t forget to sterilize her, to stop bring to the World c**t like her
---
if you want to lvl up in nw then hiding is the only way to go, dont try and kill anyone or gather anything, or launch a nuke, you get a ton more xp by just being really good and hiding in bushes or water 
---
this is my biggest complaint about nw. its not pvp its hide and seek
---
Never had that happen to me yet.
---
Was trying to see what I was missing so I could refocus on that’s stuff. Instead just downvoted lol
---
Exactly how I feel.
---
If a player decides to spend 10 hours a week in the game, it shouldn't make a difference if its spread out over 7 days or all on one day.
---
If you are interested in franchising please contact us via private message for further details.
---
Logged in 20 minutes or so after reset, played NW last night to complete the last daily, about 18 hours ago.
---
Oh I agree, we shouldn't have to jump through all those hoops just to have a nice and relaxing gaming session.
---
Yeah these posts are mega annoying now.
---
On my medic, I used to share Bodyguards, but I've never been able to verify if it stacks.  Lately I just share Stranger in Numbers. I'd love some suggestions on better cards to share with my 15 cha.
---
It doesn't seems to affect everyone. So people who are having their SCORE rewards just fine from dailies will downvote this.
---
I'm sad, rip my 1k SCORE. Now I have to grind 100k EXP to make up for that lost score
---
If u started playing NW before Adventure mode the bass sound will play for all notifications. Reset and relog 👍
---
I want to keep playing and supporting the game, but with every update it becomes increasingly hard..
---
Not sure about Steel Dawn, but Fractured Steel has been announced as a winter release, which probably means Q1, so I can see that being pushed to April.
---
Fuck, fuck, *fuck*. I just finished 3 weeklies.
---
&gt; So you're quitting because of something you don't have to take part in? Alrighty then.
---
I'm quiting because its one more design decision that I don't agree with. 
---
If you read my post you would see this alone wouldn't cause me to quit, but it is the combination of things.
---
&gt;I have honestly never seen anyone complain about doing daily stuff for any other game because those people are like 'i cannot or don't want to log in daily so that's okay'
---
No other games really take it to the level of this game.
---
i hate the fact that lunch boxes have weight so its impossible for some ppl to save them up to use them at a special occasion. just throw them away when ever you can to get rid of the weight
---
I love this post. I don't mean any criticism at all OP, but 1/3rd of it essentially being "how to psychologically prepare yourself to play Fallout 76" sounds like some kind of Orwellian nightmare but it's hilarious at the same time.
---
you think they would sell us the best items?
---
you dont think that they have the better equipment then what they sell us ?
---
You're quitting because they're giving you optional free stuff?
---
At level 250 I level up around once or twice a session when I really get into it so shouldn't be too much work to get the level up challenge each time. Also keep all the outfits on hand for level up challenges that require outfits.
---
*Shouldn't* have happened. Usually happens when you've just played or are in the middle of playing NW when reset happens. If you played right after reset it may have happened.
---
Outside of that bug there are others that do this too unfortunately. Cannot believe they didn't fix it with this new system. How many folks are going to get robbed of levels on the pass because of this?
---
same
---
&gt; You're quitting because they're giving you optional free stuff?
---
Another person with reading comprehension failure.
---
"I hate to say it..."
---
You could have just quit the game, without a post. 
---
No, it was very important for you to say it.
---
Same here, goodwill is something that is in short supply, there is only so much of it you can have. I did tag ones of the Bethesda mods to your post, I'm pretty sure they are aware due to the tickets they must have received, the mods might just not be allowed to comment on this issue just yet, hoping this changes soon.
---
Scrip.
---
&gt; "I hate to say it..."
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You could have just quit the game, without a post.

&gt; No, it was very important for you to say it.

You clicked on it and commented. You could of just not commented. 
---
No, it was very important for you to comment.
---
Again a pathetic fuckup by Bugthesda...when will they do something right
---
That's why it's worth it to slap a paint job on things you want to keep, even if you don't particularly like the paint. Sorry for your loss, friend.
---
Thanks for the tip!    These perk cards are new to me.   I've always played sneak-shoot-hide style...but this game won't allow that.   And it took me till level 40 before i realized that i could build a set and make the game easier and more enjoyable to play.
---
Yep the weekly's are not paying out score .. i got 3000 owing to me
---
Agreed and I'm thinking even more hours than that but sometimes less too.
---
I know some folks are bummed because they work most of the week and the one day they can log in they can only get 200 bullion, 1400 caps from vendors, and 150 scrip. If someone can only play once a day and they wanna do more with that one day they should be able to.
---
Pipe is life...
---
These are the top of the top, people will sell entire stashes of bloodied weapons and unyielding armor just to get one.
---
Level 52.    I'm working on the rifleman build.    I should have started way earlier as i seem to have a lot of level 1 perk cards that are useless right now
---
No it takes 9 hours like all the reddit post cried about lol
---
Or you could encounter the auto complete bug and get it done instantly at the cost of no score points!
---
It said' wow such empty
---
Can you not even pop on for like 2 minutes to scrap them?
---
&gt; With that said I don't understand these posts. You can just play the game and ignore this completely.
---
I posted, because I do actually love the game. And I feel these design decisions are ruining what could be a great game. They are adding hurdles to slow us down and add tedium to the game.
---
Truth. It's bugged AF. It isn't worth trying when it is this badly broken.
---
It’s no different than someone running to Reddit to tell everyone they helped someone.
---
Is the math done like norespawns?
---
There are some also at Charleston: Snally and Grafton monter if I remember correctly.
---
youre right, this post is shit!
---
That's a key thing you point out there actually. It's subjective ofc, but the devs need to play it safe: as long as it's questionable/debatable whether you can "damage" others by "speeding", they have to put the limits there. Many would probably see it unfair if some few with all the time on their hands could get stuff they might not even have the chance of obtaining a month later - but beyond that, since there's a deadline to this whole season, they gotta make sure those top speed differences are only so big, so that it doesn't become the sole factor in whether one can "win the race". 
---
Again, this is all subjective, I know; and the numbers/amounts do need to be fleshed out. But the point is there.
---
Bethesda's support site is undergoing maintenance. Fan-fucking-tastic. The equivalent of score I lost is the same as 100K XP. Nice.
---
I noticed it after the second but stupidly assumed it was visual since some of the other SCORE deals didn't pop up for a little bit.
---
Edit: math was wrong, forgot to multiply by number if challenges. How long does it take to farm 300K XP?
---
A lot of the damage reduction perks if you can fit them in such as blocker and fireproof. Suppressor weapons are also nice if you run them with tenderizer to really help your team out.
---
No. That's why lol
---
I was expanding on your point rather than refuting it. If you check my links, you'll see that they specifically say around 10 weeks and mid-September, rather than specifically exactly 10 weeks.
---
Kiddie Corner almost always has Snally's as well.
---
August 18-24th
---
Question, how do you differentiate between the 25s
---
1 minute? Amateur.
---
Toxic Larry's. Small space, always snallygasters. Will take more time to load in and FT than it will to hunt them down and kill.
---
Hahaha we were having the same issue on PS4. Mislabeled enemies (I'm looking at you, diseased robobrain wearing a Scorched outfit), awful lag, completely bugged out Scorchbeasts. Then I did a WS run for XP and half the ghouls were frozen and headless. No complaints here though, for the first time ever the lag seemed to work in my favor and wouldn't let the living ghouls connect with a hit if the server stuttered just as they jumped at me, which was basically every time one lunged at me.
---
All we were missing was rabid dogs with their necks stretched 6 feet in the other direction like the good ole days.
---
There's a card that reduces energy ammo, and increases fusion core duration
---
It's legit. Saw it on [Kevduit's video (7:45)](https://youtu.be/7UPpVELodkU?t=465).
---
Oh that is actually a great idea, and that’s coming from me who actually like the Season.
---
Yeah, not really comparable to my 500+ hours on Fallout 4 or New vegas.
---
I was thinking flooded trainyard. Always about half a dozen Snallies there.
---
I did this and it didnt count. Then i killed the wendio in the mire for the tissue sample challenge also didnt count. I think mine is broken lol
---
but it's a design decision which doesn't and should't effect you.
---
You've never played World of Warcraft have you? The daily stuff on there can easily take hours (even more with multiple characters). And the grind. OH BOY! The grind would make some of the complainers on here cry. And they timegated stuff. And they put a limit on the currency you could earn. And put a limit on how much rep you could earn per week. So even if there was an exploit like the raider rep you could only use it to a point. This "grind" in fo76 is nothing.
---
I always kill the grafton monster for large enemy challenge
---
I do belive that would be my: bloody, two shot, anti armor golf club thank you very much;)
---
Yes. If you want to be competitive, you're gonna need legendary gear. 
---
I'm not talking pvp. You need some very specific legendary gear if you want to do that. I'm talking PVE.
---
You won't get kills as fast as others who have good stuff. Meaning less xp per play session. Meaning less leveling up. Meaning you're progress through the game is slower.
---
Queen fights require you to do a minimum amount of damage to be able to loot her.Those of us with good gear can take her down pretty quick. Quick enough that a low level or poorly geared person doesn't have time to hit that minimum.
---
The game can be played and beaten without legendary gear. But you'll have a harder time.
---
Your best bet for legendary gear is player vendors. Save up your caps and go shopping. Eventually you'll figure out a hunting routine, but thats a whole other thread. 
---
Keep an eye out for bloodied, junkies, furious, instigating and anti armor. Those are the top five weapon effects. For armor, it's vanguards, bolstering, unyielding, mutants and life saving.
---
I didn't think about it like that, with the double xp and score weekend coming up we'll have to see how everything smooths out and how much of a grind it really is.
---
You can select 1* for each 3 CHR. So if you have 3 CHR,  you can only share a 1 star card.
---
Just go into your perk card screen, and when you look at an equipped card, it should have the menu option to share it below the cards.
---
It's "Y" on XB.
---
They don't necessarily need to break down into materials, just rework the ratios to be more logical, or have them break down into materials that cant be sold. New ones that are specific to this crafting system. 
---
I admit this is all armchair quarterbacking because I know nothing about programming so I dont know what that would take.
---
I disagree because you do not need to participate and grind out seasons. This is a new challenge for those who want it. If you don’t want it, don’t do it. Quitting over this is silly.
---
&gt; but it's a design decision which doesn't and should't effect you.
---
How does it not effect me? I play the game. I want to grind, but I don't want to be forced to grind every day or have to buy it in the end.
---
And I played vanilla FF XI, if you want to talk about grinds, not much come close to that game.
---
You may want the Stabilize perk under intelligence if you're running PA all the time.
---
I will think about it alot of people want to use the ammo conversion as a service and I think I may do it once mine is all cleared up for a small fee.
---
It's great for a marketing point of view, however since they only update the atom shop once a week. It's pretty flawed. Instead of a limit due to dailey and weekly challenges they should have added a weekly level cap say level 20 or 25. Keep the daileys and weeklys, but add in score from events, and once you hit the weekly cap you dont earn any.
---
Slightly miss-read this and saw “all gamers die in the end”. Oof.
---
Stimpack me i just got an instigating +10 ads and +1 S plasma caster and i wanna use it
---
Are public event the exclamation ones?
---
Definetly would go for the poweruser perk, doubles the fusioncore lifetime on level three. Some other perks in the intelligence tree are also nice like the one that that makes your non explosive heavy weapons pierce a good % of enemy armor and has a Chance to make them stumble while u wear PA i forgot the Name. Also the scrapper perk is a good Thing as it doubles the resources (mainly thatll be steel i guess) you get from scrapping enemy weapons. 
---
In the strength tree also must have in my opinion is the perk that reduces ballistic ammo weight by 90% it will make a huge difference when you carry thousands of bullets for your heavy weapon(s) of choice.
---
In my opinion the two points in the agility tree that almost doubles the amount of bullets you get when crafting them is also more than useful... And if you have some spare points the perk that lets you repair armor and Power armor to 200% is nice too. 
---
And for the Real luxury needings i would recommend getting a high level of weapon Smith as it makes your weapons WAY more durable plus the ability to craft heavy weapons yourself which can save you from buying/finding mods for your weapon of choice as you can simply craft and scrap them again for obtaining These. 
---
Yep... Thats it for now u guess
---
Thank you for your comment. Our employees will fix it. It will produce 1 banana and 4 watermelons every time you log in.
---
I would like to partake in the buying of things. Would you be able to do that?
---
Right. I passively did the daily just going to start operation tidy.
---
Disease cure should fix the dumbs (-15 INT)
---
Can you swap the party type without disbanding the party?
---
Each lvl of intelligence adds ~ 2% exp
---
So +4 int would be an ~ 8% increase in exp
---
Bit of an update on my situation, maybe useful for some of you. I am responding to this comment, as you might be onto something. So my game had crashed and deleted itself... 70gb download and a quick database rebuild/power recycle the ps, i could access my stashbox, but i still had all other problems. So i scrapped the ammo bs and the sink(some other stuff so i have about 20% in my camp budget free) switched off ps, had a coffee(10min or so), and came back to the game. I am playing for over two hours now, no lag, no slow motion, so far i could fast travel to anywhere for the first try... yes, i do have a clean install, but it was still crap with new items, so i am wondering, could be our problems (lag/slow motion) related to a fairly full camp with ammo converter/clean sink? It might worth a try to scrap those sh!t and switch off ps for 10...
---
Does anyone know if this was patched out overnight/this morning?  I'm trying to get that skeleton, but am unsure if folks are still getting these drops... or if I'm grinding for nothing! :D
---
&gt; I disagree because you do not need to participate and grind out seasons. This is a new challenge for those who want it. If you don’t want it, don’t do it. 
---
I want it, I just also want to be able to grind over one day instead of spread it out. 
---
&gt;Quitting over this is silly.
---
It is just the final straw. It shows me at the end of the day Beth don't care about a certain group of players.
---
Same here, 1000 points gone. 
---
How lovely that the required score xp is so strict too, now im forced to buy Atoms... oh wait.  Yea fuck no.
---
All Hunts' brand Adventure kits™ come with a Bow and arrows, a Ragstag combat knife, a set of heavy leather armour, 5 diluted stimpacks, 2 diluted Rad-X and 3 purified water plus the first 20 will receive a FREE treasure hunter outfit with their kit! Hope this clears everything up!
---
Dude talking about us being greedy...when he is bei g cheap (same as greedy) .... ROFL
---
Doesn't matter that their site is down for maintenance, they won't help. 
---
"We are currently unable to grant you the missing S.C.O.R.E. points due to tool limitation, and we apologize for this inconvenience."
---
Well, that’s not entirely true. It’s only a waste of gold if you actually buy the other non-shielded under armor linings... ✌️
---
Hmm I thought it was an M4 so it is a AR10? I've only ever heard of the AR15 and M4, M16. Could someone fill me in on a little history of the skin and type of gun it is so I can name er properly instead of M4 lol.
---
And you could submit a ticket to get your score corrected instead of complaining on reddit :D
---
Yes and no, I guess. It's kind of more of the same, with just an adjustment on the daily grind if you're max level. 
---
I don't disagree, really, at least not entirely. I love the game, but it has a lot of frustrating decisions, like the scrip cap, that keep me from playing it as much as I did for the first month or two that I had it. I don't think anyone is unjustified in their complaints, whether I agree with them or not, aside from the monetization ones; whether players like that or not, it's necessary to the continuation of the game and they've done at least an acceptable job at trying to make that aspect of the game equitable even when it's not desirable to everyone who plays.
---
thank \* the backlash at least proved fruitful.
---
Seasons are 70 days long. In no scenario should they be achievable in 1 day. 
---
I don’t know how adding content for someone else means they don’t care about you. But oh well. Thanks for letting me know you’re leaving I guess. Hope you find a game you like better.
---
Just message this Reddit account privately to get your free consultation and appointment.
---
Can you put your power armor in the door of the cabin to keep people out?
---
That's what I mean, it shouldn't even be an option lol. Why would you want something that isn't the best lining?

Strange in numbers  or squad maneuvers,  and the one about extra e

Xp while teaming up
---
In the matters of reasonability, the Gauss Shotgun for damage, ammo conservation and accuracy. 
---
But Gauss Minigun go explosive brr *sooooo*
---
gauss minigun is really good but keeping it fed is virtually impossible. EC also weights a ton.
---
the shotgun is still really good even after the nerf/fix and a lot more manageable. but I wouldn't really use it outside vats, although that applies to shotguns in general.
---
&gt; Seasons are 70 days long. In no scenario should they be achievable in 1 day.
---
Nowhere have I argued this.
---
&gt;I don’t know how adding content for someone else means they don’t care about you.
---
Content is for everyone, as its free. My problem isn't with the content, its with the progression system.
---
Except not everyone is actually getting their points.
---
Can I just buy a level 50 radstag knife from you
---
If you run a heavy build, you can do a shotgun build at the same time. Same when ur running a shotgun build, u can run a heavy build too. Just switch of cards whenever you go from heavy to shotty. My main is a heavy and shotgun build. Best of both worlds so I’ll say do both

---
That's my build. I've ran it for over 200 levels now. You don't need much in the way of damage reduction perks. Just run a vamps heavy weapon and you'll never die
---
I don’t think that’s the exact wording in the support email... and it means that team can not adjust your score. They should give a link to the team that can...
---
Edit: FYI aren’t those weeklies awarding at 3/5 and staying active but awarding nothing at 5/5?
---
I’m assuming this will be in until the next update, or if they shut down servers before that to do bug fixes. So far they haven’t done that so they should still be available. But seeing as how this is completely unintended, no one will know when it gets fixed ahead of time
---
That’s really cool of you.
---
They used to have the tools to credit atoms lost due to auto completion. I wonder if it's worth asking them to credit 150 atoms to purchase a score level as compensation since they can't credit lost score.
---
.50 cal is my domination gun. With bloodied prefix. Gatling gun is great for long distance plinking. My bloodied Gatling and .50 cal one shots most enemies. 
---
My build goes as follows
---
Blocker 3, all heavy gun perks, reduced ammo weight perk (for the thousands of .50 and/or 5mm you will carry) 
---
Perception I use the perk that increase glowing enemy damage 
---
Fireproof is a 100% must imo. Makes you immune to the scorchbeast(use in tandem with blocker for full scorchbeast slayer effect) radicol is good for carry weight
---
Intelligence. Gunsmith, stabilized(PA only), nerd rage
---
Agility: action boy, adrenaline, dodgy(I use dodgy because in PA using A.P. drains the fusion core. So I let my AP absorb damage
---
Luck. I use mutation perks here
---
On your PA. If you install emergency protocols on the chest piece, you will become god mode if u combine with perks above. I rarely rarely get close to death and I run 20% health.  If anything you can spam stimpaks in power armor. Easy
---
This is for PVE. This build used to be great for PVP but when the nerfed damage to pvp, it became tough against well matched opponents. 
---
I probably left some things out but I been playing on this and tweaking since beta.
---
PS. If u don’t want bloodied. I recommend Vampires.  I swear to god if you have a vampires 50 cal or any fast automatic gun, you will never die while shooting. 99.999% safe
---
PSS I know the new ammo converter is here but please take into account an availability and how easy it is to create.  Plasma core and fusion core are tougher to find, make, and carry than traditional ballistic bullets
---
Two birds, one power fist!
---
I always just share Strange in Numbers. Best shared perk in my opinion
---
Two weeks in between seasons we're told.
---
Not just make it more friendly, put ALL the ammo types in there.
---
The don’t say this loud enough I guess. Fallout 76. Is. Pay. To. Play.
---
It’s hard telling. Remember, this is Bethesda we’re talking about...LOL
---
There is a way.
---
Stack two metal beams on top of the stair, one on top of the other.
---
Store only the middle beam.
---
Place stairs in the open spot, it should snap in place.
---
Then store the top beam.
---
https://i.imgur.com/WQ0mU0m.png

Literally the exact wording.

And for the upteenth time, it has nothing to do with the 3/5 bug. The screenshot clearly shows that I wasn't given the 2,000 points and that there is only 250 points on the bar, which was from a daily.
---
Yeah I can easily change the parks card and I love both of them for some reasons
---
You're getting down voted but I completely agree.  I can't believe all of the whining going on about this.
---
Adventure mode xp earned in NW doesn't count towards the weekly repeatable challenge; I earned a ton yesterday getting an overseer rank level up to get the NW daily challenge and noted the bar didn't change at all. I was tipped off almost immediately because when I started it was at 9XXX/10000.
---
I didn't really like the minigun, ammo is too expensive to maintain, and it doesn't really offer anything that other weapons don't already offer, dunno about shotgun.
---
How do you mean that?
---
On this sub the B2525 fixer is almost a meme at this point, people offering their nocturnal war drums for B2525 fixers.
---
Yeah haha I love them too. So id say do both. The gauss mini is just pretty expensive to keep fed with ammo
---
&gt;	I want it, I just also want to be able to grind over one day instead of spread it out.
---
3-4 years LMAO! We're almost 2 years in, so you're saying this game will be dead in 1-2 years? 
---
They've already said they want this game to be around for "decades." This game will be going strong at least until Fallout 5 comes out in 8+ years. And even after that it may still be a supported game with updates.
---
I did the same thing, and had to stop. I'd put all kinds of lower level weapons, armor, as well as supplies for free, and a sign on the machine that said; "**Free To Newcomers**".
---
After seeing a so many high level players clean me out, I had to stop, it truly was sickening... Every time I heard the sale ding, I'd look, and there they were, level 170, 280, 325, and once, a level 876, YES! you heard me right! A level 876!!! It's sad, when you see a level 876 take all your low level weapons, as well as stim packs, rad away, purified water, etc... Many might ask; *"Where are you getting all these lower level weapons and armor from?"* During the Scorched Christmas event last year. 
---
When I saw them buying all  the stuff out of my vendor, I fast travelled, and asked them, why? She, yes, she... Said it was there for the taking, then shot me! I was so mad, I shot back! Then her and her team killed me, and proceeded to destroy my C.A.M.P! That's right, a level 876 and her team, took all my free stuff for newcomers, and destroyed my C.A.M.P. during the Christmas event...
---
From then on, I stopped doing the free vendor for new comers, and went back to randomly seeking them out on the map, travel to them, and just drop a bunch of stuff at their feet.
---
It's sad that the few can ruin it for the many, but it didn't stop me, and NEVER will! Also, when I'm close to capping out, I look around for newcomer C.A.M.P.s, and buy their vending machines out, then drop everything I just purchased, with some extra goodies for them. If they have a mic, I'll also explain a few things to them about pricing as well as playing the game, and help them with their C.A.M.P. if they want it.
---
Any cards from any Speacial will do when sharing perks with team members, you are not restricted on Charisma perks (top button on PS4, triangle?)
---
Yeah before I use the minigun, I have to grind for the preparation of lead and acid. My steels are also run out😂
---
I think ammo is the only disadvantage of gauss minigun
---
I would respond again. They clearly didn’t understand the issue. 
---
But I would make sure it’s not related to the 3/5 bug
---
I haven't tested this one, but the previous "Kill a Cryptid" challenge worked with Anglers as well for some reason.
---
&gt;I want it, I just also want to be able to grind over one day instead of spread it out.
---
And .... where does that say I want 70 days of progression over that one day. Because I wasn't.
---
My point was, and it's been said but you are choosing to ignore it, is x amount of hours of grind should be the same if done on 1 day or done over 7 days.
---
Agreed, this whole system sucks and I'm done with the game now.
---
Literally the ONLY thing I want out of the whole Fucking "legendary run" is the Gatling gun skin...
---
And I'd have to grind aaaaaaaaaall the way to the near end for it, except as you said they made it as annoying and awful as possible for both the no life players (me on weekends) AND the casual players (me on weekdays).
---
So you know what? I'm not even gonna bother.
---
Take your slap in the face ammo converter and shove it Bethesda.
---
I'm so done with this goddamned mess, cancelled my 1st and I'm not gonna play this wretched mess until they fix it or abandon it completely for the next thing.
---
What a waste too, this really had the potential to be something special.
---
Yep. Just got the holiday tree + Halloween 10mm
---
My daily run ends at Crater so it's no big deal to talk to Roxy, get my treasury notes and walk inside. 
---
Plus I can't help but to say hi to Johnny and Gail.

Bethesda just said they are gonna have bonus S.C.O.R.E weekends so that means you won’t need to do the exp challenge to get the last 5,000 S.C.O.R.E
---
The season is 70 days... you said you want it In 1
---
Yep. Challenge complete. Zero score.
---
The sad thing is that only half of us get event xp. 
---
Im on of those who doesn’t.
---
But yeah if it’s supposed to give us all event xp. Then no problem
---
I do understand it. I begrudges to use the gauss minigun when doing normal adventures
---
&gt;The season is 70 days... you said you want it In 1
---
No I didn't.
---
Let me repeat.
---
No where have I argued that I should be able to do 70 days of grind over a few hours.
---
Did you really expect that they fixed it? They never fix anything they just say they fixed it but they don't.
---
Since you're like most people and don't want to do NW stuff..  there's a never ending scorch exploit going around if you really really want to farm exp... not many know about it yet and I definitely aint posting how to do it on here lol. You can get 10k exp in around 5-10min in a group of 2 doing the building group so if you have a group of 4 it'd be really nice. Its not an insane amount of exp its just nice that you don't have to fast travel around or server hop West Tec or the golf course. It is however super boring.
---
Ah, it seems links don't show up in the mail inbox, so I didn't even know you had them there until I entered the post itself!
---
That said, we don't know that the season will be 10 weeks + 6 days. There's a bit of speculation involved for both of us, but I can't say that your own speculation makes my math 'wrong'. :p
---
Related matter: do people usually max this perk or 1* is enough?
---
Start stock piling experience gain items!
---
They will come back exactly the same, mark my words, they just want people to forget.
---
All I want is the white raider gas mask, but it’s pretty deep into the levels and the eight or so hours I play on the weekends doesn’t seem like enough to get there. I’m planning to join some teams, grind some events, maybe start a new character, and just play until it ends or I get the mask.
---
Darn I knew I had forgotten something 🤣
---
It almost makes me feel like I’m in a sitcom.
---
Will my gauss minigun simply just plays the role as a scorch beast queen melter, and any other level 80+ legendary enemies. It’s furious and has a faster fire rate so I may be biased
---
Edited 13872 Times but now im done i promise 😂
---
Your wish just came true
---
I enjoy it but I play on console so a lot less “suspect” encounters
---
Thanks alot for the info, didn't know all of these were out there so i'll definitely have a look.
---
They also didn’t fix Ward
---
Very lucky
---
Too expensive. And I am not willing to use it on daily normal adventures which is very ironic that I can not use my favourite weapon normally
---
Please contact our personal page for any business inquiries.
---
That is a really good point.  How cool was it to find a secret passage in a mansion orverrun with scorched to then uncover an entire secret society based on a radio program!  That was one of my favorite things to discover.  But, as you say, it just kind of fizzles after.
---
At your level, you should really be working on things up around Grafton in the Toxic Valley. Rose is in the Savage Divide and it can spawn max level enemies there depending on what players are around. Best to wait on that stuff.
---
After you finish Grafton and stuff up in the Toxic Valley, somewhere around level 25, head down to the Ash Heap. Charleston and lower on the map. Doing this should keep you somewhat leveled for the content.
---
Join the club, we got t-shirts.
---
The jet will make you jittery...
---
if you run though the weeklys it gets you five spaces a week there almost isn't enough xp to get to the end
---
Same for me. Lost 1000 score to this. Cant even report it since their help site is "undergoing maintenance"
---
Right on, thanks!
---
Well you just grind when you can and that's all you can do. 
---
but you do you
---
Wow, good on you man! You seem like a good guy, trying to reunite an amazing gun with it's owner!
---
You nailed it.  My game play is always the same, cash in items for script as soon as I log in, get my rep from the factions and then play until I'm over encumbered with legendary items.  If can be a real short time if I get a couple of heavy items.  You know the game is broken when you're hoping you DON'T get a 25 pound Gatling plasma gun and really pissed when you get a worthless 18 pound harpoon gun.  The big choice is to decide to roll for better Secret Service Armour or try my luck with the Prveyor.  Either way it shortens the amount of time I play as the weight is always a factor.  My latest let down is to simply destroy (drop) the SS armour instead of turning them in for more script.  What a waste, it always feels like you're giving away the things you 'earned' for nothing in this game.
---
had me at 420! I'm harvesting now man!
---
It’s ridiculous that we are not willing to use our favourite gun because of the ammo it eats so fast
---
I could care less, I got my question answered
---
I think it's probably because they are so slow in releasing meaningful content that this is basically a giant filibuster. It's also why the reputation grind for Wastelanders was forced through a couple of daily quests and a handful of random encounters that rewarded a pixel of reputation.
---
Damn dude I the exact thing happen to me back in maybe 97 98 with some sojs
---
Haven’t tried that. I’m still waiting to get rid of the cornucopia of stairs that I built for the day 1 challenges.
---
good news, its double score weekend
---
bad news its daily only, so no weekly including repeatable...
---
I need more info!!!! This is far too much of a tease!!
---
Thanks for the link, very handy and i'll definitely have a look.
---
I never comment like this but yup, here we fuckin go... Bothering me too now. 
---
Ill just cancel my first til they fix it. Love my game but wanna hurt their wallets. Any other first members down for the cause with me? 
---
Ill be honest going back to "limited" game sucks and honestly worries me a bit, but we gotta teach this fuckboi a lesson.
---
I know if we do it simultaneously (coordinate a shutdown of accounts) Todd will mothafuckin move to protect his pocketbook.
---
Ill take silence as "no" and to join me....
---
*ad victoriam*  = yes
---
I’ve been grinding lead and steel in hopes of using the mini gun. Currently holding 4400 lead and 11000 steel. Now I’m going back to the Glassed Cavern to get ultracite.  
---
My biggest concern is stable crimson flux.
---
Highly recommend you get yourself Herbivore plus Cranberry Relish for 20% xp (25% if you have Strange in Numbers on a team with mutants). Also make Brain Fungus Soup for more intelligence boost for even more XP gain. Find Shielded Casual Underarmor from a vendor (very hard to get the plan) for +3 INT there too. Of course, a full bloodied set with unyielding will help more but not everyone likes to glow in the dark :)
---

---
I do this all the time. And usually bash them rather than shoot them.   I don't like missing out and I'm sure no-one else does either.  Shame more people don't do this.
---
The reason "Save Everything" mod is great and why Bethesda should just add it to the game themselves.
---
https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/fallout-series-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy-amazon-1234696997/
---
The double XP is exactly the reason I and many others said speculating on zero info of what may happen after less than two days wasn't the way to go. There will likely be more stuff I imagine. 
---
I'm as pessimistic as anyone and ready to take to task shit that's stupid, but I like to do it with a bit of info. I come from long term World of Tanks play, where these grinds are a regular occurence so I'm desensitized :D
---
Damn that was quick look! Thank you!!
---
More people needs to see this. 
---
They keep leaving my team lol.
---
That's lucky. Literally the only thing I want is the fireplace door.
---
It's level 99.
---
Yep, its lretty great, around 6 springs and acid per bear.
---
Alternating between danger and hidden with stealth, and luring the hoard boss to chase you ling distances is a good way to help force spawns.
---
I recommend luring it away from buildings or caves that the spawns could get stuck in.
---
I haven't tested enough to say if luring a boss to the savage divide for sure changes the slawns to be max level, but i have done it once to rad toads from the toxic Valley and they did change, but more tests will be needed to confirm that.
---
Commenting bc I want to know too
---
Hindsight is 20 20 but this is some thing that wouldve been easily caught on a test server just like the legendary run 3/5 bug.
---
Thanks for typing this out for me. I'll start doing something like this.
---
Probably 4 days. Most weekend events start on Thursday and end Monday morning.
---
Bye faleshia
---
Me too. I want to change it to prime. But crimson flux is my concern. I found it really annoying for the huge amount of time to sacrifice to grind all resources for just a short moment of fun using this weapon. It’s too expensive and I just don’t want to use it on SBQ only.
---
When I first got it I sat for at least an hour laboriously converting the 4000 5mm, 3000 .45 and various other ammo types I had been saving up in anticipation of this machine, thinking to myself that this is the dumbest user interface, why couldn’t it be like the vendors, pick the quantity and sell or buy it. Haven’t used it since. On the plus side I ended up with around 4000 .50 ammo from it.
---
There needs to be a PSA to not be online at refresh time. Maybe if Bethesda sees a large drop of players at the same time everyday they might actually look into it.
---
I had this same issue with trying to replace a wall. The problem persisted through a server hop to a private server, and on all my walls and floors. It got fixed completely when I stored a wall, then placed it back. After that I was able to just replace them again like normal
---
Lmao I feel that! I grew up grinding and grinding away on my skills in the original runescape, just to be able to use the weapons I thought looked cool lol. I know some things are meaningless grinds but it give you a good sense of accomplishment when you can get them done
---
&gt; Bye faleshia
---
It's Felicia
---
At least spell the insult right.
---
Oof! Good luck!
---
yes but not always ...toxic larrys is always 3 snallys
---
Some people just can't. It sucks but having a cap punishes those that can't play every day.
---
It just streams.
---
Tsssss - there, one fly of little bird, the Wasteland is waiting for you. *Que Í will Always love you by Whitney Houston as I watch you walk away*
---
Great post!  Welcome back.
---
Imagine how much preparation you need. Crimson flux, lead, ultracite, steel and acid. Oh my god, it spends hours to grind for the ammo for shooting in maybe half of hour
---
Hmm. I would say the stimpack makes more of a Ksssst noise than tsssss.
---
No probs bud! Just as a side note, I got my holiday rewards from 2 seperate matches. It seems like they're rewarded inconsistently but I got the assault rifle skin so I can't complain
---
Amen
---
This it's true lol
---
Huh, that's weird; maybe its bugged for some people? Cause I hasnt done adventure mode at all since the release, but had a sizable pool of experience after playing NW day 1
---
My guess, is because NW is a level playing field.  PVP in adventure mode has glitches and exploits to allow one person to outright destroy the competition.  Even if you stay legit, you can build your toon up and outright destroy others who aren't prepped.  An even competition is not attractive to a certain subset of PVP players.
---
If Bethesda made a Fallout game without glitches, people would complain that Bethesda didn't actually code the game.
---
Glad you enjoyed your experience. Being a day 1 player myself; the game has made considerable leaps and bounds.
---
No they are not. Its a rumor to distract Bethesda from their hard work on testing the next patch.  If you play NW now and receive those rewards, clearly your mind is wrong and you’re seeing things.  No need to alert everyone that you’re going crazy.  Just play on and keep quiet.
---
Do you know exactly what they did with the nerf? Just turned down the damage? Does it still count as an explosive weapon?
---
Yeah be careful though. Anything you build attached to the upper one can't be deleted as the game will think it's floating. You only option is to move your CAMP and try again.
---
I hear in Icelandic so it’s tsss... or whatever 😂
---
Have the weeklies already reset? The timer at the top says 6d 19hrs but I wasn't expecting weeklies to be reset until Tues.
---
I feel bad, none of them are interesting, none of them are useful, I may go for the power armor cards or just blow all my points on blood sacrifice just so I feel more imbued with mothman cult energy lmao
---
Were you logged in at refresh time?
---
I agree completely. But there should at least also be a cap sink character like smiley where we can purchase a certain amount of scrip per week for caps too
---
This was taken day 1 of the update.
---
The point I was trying to make is, People like me, that can not play every day to get the points adds up to this. Bethesda knows this. I do not even care for the rewards myself. I did like to try and get on to catch some Atoms but I only have one day during the week to actually play for about an hour. I play all weekend though. Hens that's how I am level 460 on my main, and three more under level 200. I have almost 2000 hour in it now. So yes, why cant I have top tier stuff on my time? It does not make Bethesda money.....
---
Were uou logged in at reset time?
---
Well thats a bit wacky bet you hear the 10mm pistol as puck puck instead of dink dink
---
Thanks man.   Yeah i'm more into PVE anyway so i'd like my character to be hold its own in any fight.   Currently i have 2 legendary armor which i certainly see the results with.  Just looking for that one awesome go to weapon.   I've been in those SBQ fights where it's almost funny for me to be there...basically throwing rocks in the air.   Everyone's cool though and i have fun regardless.
---
Holy  
---
shit
---
If you do nothing but (every) event you can level up 10 times per day. So continue that trend and you can level up 100 times in 10 days
---
I was in a NW match
---
Currently have 22 secret service left arms clogging my inventory.   None with the prefix i am looking for.   Absolutely ridiculous.  Will take 2 or 3 days to cash them in.
---
Great, thanks!
---
I'm suddenly feeling the urge to jump on and play a few rounds.
---
Bro there’s 599 other posts asking this, go read them. And yes they’re obtainable
---
Couldn't you have completed them and had the 1000 score at 3/5 bug? Or were they completed as soon as you logged in?
---
it wasn't exactly a nerf. gauss shotguns dealt full charge damage per tap while using vats prior to this patch. which means you could essentially turn it into an automatic weapon while still dealing full damage.
---
they fixed this (and broke gauss rifles and pistols in the process), so now you actually have to charge it.
---
Bethesda will release a “New” “Improved” version available via Fallout 1st+ for an additional £10 as an “enhancement “ to Fallout 1st.....
---
Cring
---
To be fair the grind for lead and steel will happen for me no matter what since I make a ton of ammo for my other weapons and for selling.  And I've got a fairly simple route for both.  It isn't exciting, but it does get the resources.  I just have to add Glassed Cavern into the mix now.
---
Look at the score at the top. They were completed when I first logged in, the only points I was awarded are for the 1 daily.
---
When they say tool limitation they mean their tool of a boss is limiting the free(earned) stuff that they can give out
---
Holy fucking shit
---
Hey all, we've read a lot of your feedback on the Ammo Converter and we're already looking into ways we can improve it in the future. More details to come as soon as our plan for it is more solidified. Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts on the Converter with us!
---
Can't wait to see how how buggy it is /s.
---
Yeah I used it for queens only and used about 3k rounds per queen
---
I’m on the skeleton outfit step, so wanted to make sure if it was still happening since I can’t see how much xp I have towards it
---
It seems that anyone showing this issue, was logged in at reset time. I'm going to avoid reset time until it's sorted. Quite easy for me due to timezone, but I feel for people who regularly play at that time.
---
:0
---
Looks like I’m getting amazon prime!
---
The only toxic people I have ever run into are the ones that brag about their KD online, but those are going to be everywhere for any online shooter. As a whole I've never run into any toxic players, and I've been playing online since 2007. Now Halo 2 was a different story. That was a while ago, and friends of mine who played it back then agree that the Halo community has changed

I open a build team on my private when I am doing crap, gives you +1 int for nothing.
---
A move to TV makes sense considering the "accused" sexual predator Les Mooves is on the Zenimax board of directors
---
No I didn’t think they’d actually fix it but I’ve never seen this happen before unless I was in nw during refresh time or entered nw before adventure mode
---
I don’t mind logging off for reset time, and will try it tomorrow... I was just in the NW match to get the daily done lvl 1 time in NW.. missed it by 3 minutes.
---
Ooooh, it's XP based? I thought I was getting them just for completing matches lmao
---
Side question; Can the ammo converter be used at other peoples camp, or do we need to unlock our own?
---
They commented that it was not intended to be craftable and should not have been in the crafting menu. I think it was a tweet or something, but no it was mentioned in patch notes or anything.
---
Edit: added link to Bethesda response:

i was just saying to my pal the other day that i'm surprised there's not a show or film yet.
---
Also. not sure if you've seen this before  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcgxXnEVVyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcgxXnEVVyM) 
---
It's "fan made" i say "fan made" because they get doug jones to appear and production values are fairly decent.
---
I have 15 strength, and end up pairing radcool and full unyielding armor. With my sheepsquatch staff and sneak criticals I do 4,500 damage on one hit. 
---
You can also double the benefits of unyielding with a glitch and at that point I get 6,200 damage with one swing. 
---
The only trouble I have anymore in the SBQ and that's only because I gotta be up in her grill and get hit with her radiation lol not to mention if I get found, then I usually die quickly lol
---
I was, but I’ve been in adventure mode before during refresh time and that’s never happened before unless I was in nw or entered nw first before adventure
---
I hope its not generic like most post-apoc shows and film
---
I have been thinking about this for about 30 minutes
---
.. And I'm not to sure your even speaking english at this point... You mind explaining
---
I dropped my be Gatling plasma at a encryptid
---
Yeah now that the sbq can't be crippled you can lose one gun army, I've just been using good with salt. Also adrenalin isn't working right now so you can play around with those points if you wanted to
---
Well, it sucks that I cant get an adventure kit for my friend. We both play on Xbox and im trying to help him with the game. Oh well. Hope the Hunts' brand Adventure kits goes well. Good luck.
---
I’m just in it for the space wallpaper so I’m taking this season slow lol
---
&gt;You make it so the people who don't have all the time in the world cant get invested
---
Bethesda made it so that people who don't have all the time in the world CAN get invested, by investing in atoms...
---
Yeah I see it now. I'd be livid!
---
Have you put a ticket in. The auto response says they can't award SCORE from their end, but surely they could give you the items you might miss if that 2000 would tip you into another rank at the end.
---
Unmmm FFR and explosive can’t be in the same gun
---
if shit is for free, YOU are the product 
---
what you gon' do with their IGNs?
---
Casus manet!
---
it’s a good game, i just retuned from ps4, playing on pc.  i quit due to the bugs but retuned to give it another go, i like the new content even enjoying teams.  but it still needs text chat to be better
---
Right. They built a notice into the game telling you that you can craft a new one when  you drop it. All because they never intended for you to craft it. Makes total sense.
---
Why not the slide bar we use for everything else? Having to convert in small increments is annoying, especially if you don't have a round number of ammo.
---
And I could only put in 18 .38 rounds each time for 20 points. I can't just put in the number of rounds I need for 2000 ammo points? I don't want to spend an hour converting ammo, lol. SMH.
---
Welcome back fellow vault dweller. What platform are you on?
---
This is probably gonna be unpopular but wastelanders should've been the way the game released. For it to take two years to get to the point of wastelanders is pretty scary. Played in beta and didn't enjoy it. Played wastelanders and there was a huge difference in the level of game play. 
---
Your first impression is fine. However not everyone had the same first impression as you that is why the game originally got as much hate as it did.
---
So it seems by trying to fix NW causing it, they've made it happen for people in adventure. Edit: people in both modes.
---
Already put a ticket in. 
---
This was after they tried to tell me it was the 3/5 bug.
---
I believe that was patched
---
Ok. I did get the score eventually, by looting a random nuke keycard cargobot....
---
Seriously WTF.....
---
The Hunts' corporation is happy to inform after business is concluded we do not use your information for any purposes and the only thing about you is that you have recieved the kit.
---
I'm really excited to see this. Amazon has a pretty solid line up for their TV shows. The boys, an invincible animated series is coming up, now this. I'm pretty stoked.
---
Sounds like you are losing interest in the game (like me).
---
normal armots doesnt have % dmg reduction so they  arent that good. use % perks for huge boost.
---
should also throw in a treasure map or two. great idea.  but i swear, if i come to get my kit and you try to sell me a timeshare in Cranberry bog...so help me....
---
It means you have to craft the ammo for almost 100 times. Assuming that each time you farm in the lucky hole mine gives you 1400 lead and it can craft 280 times. 280x27x1.3=9813. Do you think it’s worth spending 1/3 of them to do per SBQ?

Always Avoided AWOL because of Gutsys. Then someone was nice enough to tell me to shoot them in their thruster. Now I’m always there.
---
I don't understand, are you upset they fixed a bug?
---
The script limit is the biggest impediment to playing the game.  You're already limited by weight and the items you need to get rid of to create weight space have a limit on how much you can scrap. Every day the first thing I do is cash in my legendary items and use up my script limit and then can only play until I'm over encumbered with crappy legendary items that are worthless to sell in vending machines.   It feels so crappy, and it's something I've have to do it way to often, deciding to drop a 3* legendary item on the ground just because I want to continue playing.  There have been so many times where I wish instead of a shitty drop (and let's face it 98% of them are shitty) I just got the script  from a legendary creature.
---
Yeah, this is ridiculous, and I thought Warframe's NW had it's moments, but they give you adequate time for that, routinely change the challenges up if they're too time consuming/hard (Their first season was a farcry from today), and there's a catchup mechanic built in to allow you to do the challenges you missed after finishing the current weeks.
---
And this is from a free to play title that is almost *all about the grind*
---
I've been able to wrap up most of the F076 daily challenges as a brand new player (I'm only lvl 13) so far, but if my dream of having myself and my GF roaming around in Captain Cosmos suits is to become a reality then I'm going to have to grind her account too, there's just no way she'd be able to make it off the weekly challenges and maybe a couple daily challenges along the way.
---
Try One Violent Night, and keep wendigo alive until just before the timer runs out (easier to do on a private world). Constant stream of ghouls for 30 minutes. Usually a handful of legendaries mixed in (w/better rewards than wendigo). And so much xp if everybody in the event plays nicely. My 320 character can go up over 1/2 a level just in this one event. Probably closer to 3/4 with some of the new xp booster groups available.
---
You can! Just sit in a bush for 24 hours.
---
Wow! Very poor customer service/public relations there. I at least thought they might offer some atoms, we all know they can award those.
---
It's pretty obvious that you didn't actually read my post.
---
&gt; where you have to grind hard AND pay money in order to complete
---
You don't need to pay. With the double SCORE weekend, just completing the dailies and weeklies will get you to 100. Throw in the xp you get along the way and you should end up finishing about a week early, maybe a bit more. Grinding xp on top of that (throw in the double xp weekend as well) and people should be able to finish it a decent amount of time early.  
---
That isn't to say that it's good in its current state, it's definitely on the more demanding end of the spectrum as far as these kind of systems go. Regular play (not grinding) should get you done in ~7 weeks imo, not 9, that way you've got a bit of breathing room to take time off if you want to.
---
just do what i do, switch to building at the start, during the last 30seconds/before handing in switch to events, the bond carries over
---
Were you online at the refresh time?
---
This is pure awesomeness, bravo. And your pitch is dope
---
It's a bad post, vats accuracy has nothing to do with weapon accuracy
---
I was really disappointed by this. I don't usually care about the daily/weekly challenges, and just saw them as a nice bonus when I hit them. But i saw a couple neat things I wanted on the Run so I went out of my usual route and completed 3 weekly challenges, and didn't get any SCORE. I'm not going to stop playing or anything, but I was bummed. Glad it isn't just me, though.
---
The menus are poorly done, and it takes forever to trade out a lot of ammo.  You hit the nail on the head.  There's no excuse for poorly done.  This isn't a $10 third-rate studio game.  I expect more than a patronizing "you asked for it!" half-baked solution.
---
Does it work?  Sure. But my space bar now squeaks from all the times I've had to hit it to trade out 8700 fusion cells.  And it took probably 45+ minutes to do so.
---
A solution?  Don't just allow X number of items traded at once.  You could even do one more menu that allowed you to trade 1 "bundle" to 10 "bundles".  That would cut out 90% of the clicks needed to sell a bunch of ammo.  It could even give you an option to "trade maximum" that would let you trade up to the point limit all at once.
---
On the upside, it gives me something to do between nuke strikes.
---
thats great. basically. lets wait for the result but thats something id definitly watch the first episode of.
---
It'll take me 69 days
---
Im on rank 10 in just 3 days with 4 hours spent each day. Dont see what everyones on about. At this rate i can be completed in 35 days when i factor the increase in xp for each rank.
---
Also a casual can be done in  90 days with 1.5 hours a day.
---
&gt;Now when I go to the crafting menu, the helmet is not even there.
---
is that not them fixing it?
---
Bethesda bad
---
(violently shakes Smiley) 
---
yea... no smiley gold this week
---
Not at all! Our CEO wants to spread his joy of hunting and the outdoors to the new Dwellers coming our of the Vault. Our goal with this endeavor is to take a little of our time to bring back to those who have a hard time playing the game due to lack of equipment.
---
Honestly no. It’s fun and all but nah. Imo the ammo is too expensive just to spend 3k ammo for just 10mins. I just use the shotty for the queen. It does enough damage and it’s much easier on the ammo. so yeah 🤷🏼‍♂️ (and also, I use ultracite 2mm)
---
best news of the day. lets see what they make out of it.
---
Steel dawn is the BOS quest line coming with One Wasteland
---
not sure what cards you are referring to as meta because they were all trash.
---
It is about 16 games if you are good at nuclear winter and win alot. But you need to unlock even other reward first so it's like 30k XP on total
---
This is good to have.    
---
IMO, the interface is bad. Who cares if it's high or low tier? It should be alphabetized to find what you want to sell easier. You should be able to sell in multiples of 10, 100, and 500.
---
Just remember...
---
No Turrets!
---
Im set up @ the Junk node on the highway to Watoga south of the abandoned bog town.
---
Been there ages and get left alone 90% of the time.
---
People saying you don't have to participate in a free thing simply do not understand the core issue. It isn't about not being to easily obtain the items. 
---
It is that the game repeatedly punishes and caps your grind so you have to keep logging on every day. This is one of the worst "passes" for any game I've ever seen. Even dead by daylight has a better system. 
---
Just because its free doesn't mean it is free from criticism or critique.  Especially when the s.c.o.r.e system is buggy and sometimes doesn't even reward you the points. 
---
Its demoralizing to be punished because you want to play and progress but you can't because of seemingly arbitrary caps.
---
don't gotta edit your comment like that lol
---
That question does not bode well for the "casual" part.
---
If you dropped the helmet you got a notice specifically telling you that you can craft a new one.  It appeared in the menu and you couldn't actually craft it.  So I would say no, that isn't a fix.
---
Crap I play on Xbox but this is really cool
---
I agree, I think the items from the season didn't get a chance to be tested in the test servers and that means it'll be a bit clunky, but once they get some feedback we'll see a patch with a rework like usual.
---
You do. I have Done Every Daily And Weekly and have only got 1583/10000 xp then I did scorched earth and got 1000 xp
---
I’ll upvote this every time I see it posted!
---
Not mine, but just wanted to say what a nice thing your doing going out of your way to find the owner of that weapon good on you
---
Well Im not making it

I used to only see one or possibly two others at Heart of the Swamp, but since Wastelanders I've seen four or five others pretty consistently.  It's so much quicker now.
---
The only thing annoys me when I do SBQ is she keeps flying😂😂😂it’s fine when she’s on the ground
---
I don't believe there has been confirmation on either of those things, although there are reports that someone has reached 100 already with and xp glitch so they would know for point 1 (if it's true).
---
Someone on here had a theory that the weekly xp might switch to completing public events, which would fit with the FAQ response stating that you could earn score from Public Events. 
---
It has also been confirmed that there will be a double XP and SCORE weekend.
---
I believe so, as it will use your Xbox Live account (if you download on Windows Store).
---
No Man's Sky does the same, I have the same account on both Xbox and PC.
---
Kilter Films is the production company behind Westworld, and they've won Emmys and Oscars for their other TV and film projects, so I have high hopes.
---
Now I wonder which era it'll be set in.
---
I don't even have it so I can't weigh in (doesn't fit the aesthetics  of my C.A.M.P.) but I have seen it is an issue for users. I am sure they will make it easier!
---
I had a legacy TSE Gauss and was so disgusted with it's performance in VATS that I sold it.
---
Has anyone been able to test if this also affects Tenderizer and Gun Fu? I’m noticing pretty static damage across the board when I’m sure I should be seeing some increases.
---
Handmade skin time
---
The furthest I got is the first Pipboy paint.
---
Wcouldnt activate quest with ward yesterday. Just normal dialogue options
---
I'm not saying it wasn't bugged, I'm just telling you they said it was not meant to be craftable. Downvote if you like, I'm just relaying what Bethesda said.
---
SCORE_Challenge_Weekly_QuestComplete_Events_RECURRING "REPEATABLE: Complete a Public Event"
---
This was datamined.
---
And yes, it increases by 25 every level up, and I haven't heard of a cap yet.
---
&gt; This is probably the best way for Bethesda to burn out the people who actually like this game and make them not want to comeback for a while
---
They've already been doing that quite well for the past year, but I guess they hired more specialists to ensure they keep performing at their peak
---
Just hope they don’t fuck the lore up all together. Also kinda interested to see what year its based.
---
It was much worse on my 10 mm pistol that I use for killing fireflies.   Took about 6 shots to kill one, with 95 percent chance of a hit showing.   Ridiculous.   Easier to maybe just to use the pistol as a melee weapon.  Cripes.
---
I run stealth, unyeldinng, bloody, crits, vats build. With non-auto lever rifle (B/50C) I do 5k on headshot crits with broken adrenaline perk. On Fixer (B/50C) its usually 3k but auto fire and additionally around 500 more damage every second shot from crits (34 luck). You might only have higher damage per second with 25 faster fire rate auto fixer. Maybe if they patch crit damage bonus then it will be the best build.
---
P.S. Headshots are not crits. Its separate.
---
&gt;it was not meant to be craftable.
---
That is why you got a notice saying that you could craft a new one when you dropped it. Okay. That makes complete sense.
---
I checked mine and it's gone as well.
---
A hunters long coat specifically?
---
Yeah don’t shoot her when she is flying 😂 will just cause her to stay longer in the air
---
Now you can spend an hour at the ammo machine converting all the .38 and .44 ammo that you got while doing the above tasks!  See, they care about endgame play.
---
Imho shadowed is one mod that is not needed when you have your set of unyielding.
---
(then the last week of season 1, random SCORE crates dropped all over appalachia, to let people immediately catch up, much to the chagrin of people who spent endless hours to get the secret service ghillie)
---
Yeah, do NOT underestimate those stupid crickets.
---
I think they should add a monthly tab as well but make them much harder to achieve almost like the tadpole and possum ones but make the amount of score reflect the amount of work that they entail. So for the guys that cant play more than once or twice a week
---
We are hoping to eventually get franchises in the XB1 and PS4 versions of the game.
---
Awesome!
---
What does the casual part have to do with it, I'm just asking what level you're mate
---
Lucky bastard, those goddamn chickens are weeks away for me.
---
I do want to use the gauss minigun but it’s too too too expensive to spend 3K ammo in 10 minutes 😭
---
Well my bad. 
---
Maybe someone new like me will see it then.
---
Thank you for the tag! We're investigating this issue.
---
Yep I was gifted one by a player that liked my camp maybe it was duped.
---
My first 4 SS pieces - all unyielding, which isn't what I want.  RNG FTW.

 &gt; Thank you for the tag! We're investigating this issue.
---
True but that's a whole day missed recovered at least. Good to point out though. I'm hoping the weekly repeatable is XP based.
---
Weird. Thanks for letting me know.
---
This is true as well. And with that we can think of what to truly value with our time. Prioritize what we should really get upset over. Because someday we'll all just be skeletons
---
I almost burnt my self out through Fashnut trying to get the Deathclaw Mask. finally got one on the second to last day
---
Yea I only need to worry about running out of berry mentats, the other things i consume are easily replaced/grown like cranberries/Sugar and brain fungus.
---
If you dropped it inside it is instanced and no one could pick it up, it is gone.
---
Specs?
---
Wayward is instanced so I don’t think anyone else would be able to pick it up?
---
the sink is basically the same as that old school water pump
---
[edit: but can be placed on floors]
---
Just like the radicals mask were not intended to be legendary yet they took the time to code them as legendary  , instead of admitting it had unintended consequences they lied and said it was a mistake
---
If you have a recently played with message them and ask
---
I kills me people don't join build teams. Then again, one thing public teams has reinforced is that the majority of players are NOT reading this sub ;-)
---
Ooh nice that means today i'll have a steady flux if visitor.my camp is right next to to Larry
---
Haven't played since before the update. I was kinda excited to see what would get added. I thought The Legendary Run would have some cool stuff to unlock. Why not get items as a bonus to playing.
---
Saw how stupid they implemented the score system and how much you have to play and didn't bother even loading the game up. Just loaded the game up 5mins ago and had a look what stuff you can get. Utter garbage, not worth my effort or time. I think I'll stick to playing other things while Bethesda get their heads out their ass...again

I am not that far behind you, I want the Appalachian Thunder skin for the Gatling Gun
---
Welcome! Take your time and don’t rush. That’s the greatest wisdom I can give you. Explore and don’t think things too seriously.
---
Also “leader of the pack” is great event for when you are level 1-10 to get some good starter gear. 
---
Also remember you can repair gear and breakdown junk at workbenches. Store scrap in stash box.
---
With the right goodies and build it's about 30 kills to get 10k.
---
Nice cal beo
---
I have a rx 580 and a ryzen 5 not sure witch kind.
---
Hmmm, after reading some of the responses, I changed my comment. I saw you use the word "forced". If you ever feel forced to play a video game, you should definitely put the controller or keyboard down and take your kid to the park to play catch or frisbee, or take the dog to the dog park. I can't imagine feeling "forced" to play a video game. I enjoy FO76, and I certainly don't begrudge people that can play everyday getting some extra stuff. I don't expect Bethesda to only cater to me, there are thousand upon thousands out there that can play every day, and more power to them. I hope they enjoy their nifty stuff and I'll collect what I can along the way. Doesn't affect or impair me in the slightest, and certainly doesn't "force" me to do anything. Good luck with whatever you choose.
---
Again, never said it made sense or was not bugged, just saying that they said they would remove it from the crafting menu, which they have now done. See the tweet that I edited into my original comment.
---
I have a b3325 lmg on PC would you actually trade that for a b2525 fixer?
---
Its just daily's, dont get all crazy now lol
---
https://fo76map.com
---
Yep, I did that questline right away. Really one of my favorite questlines in the game.
---
I’ve read about this trick but never tried it or seen it in action. Can’t wait to try tonight!
---
Also, Queen of the Hunt is a guaranteed Cryptid, might be worthwile to knock part of it out while doing a Daily too.
---
Max
---
What platform? I'll check my stash when I get home from work. Thankfully I haven't had anything disappear from my stash yet but my fiance had stuff just randomly vanish, including a BE lever action :(
---
Thank you, always good to hear from you :)
---
Thanks but I'm not a fan of exploits. Do what makes you happy or is fun, I'm not judging or bashing honest. Also, i find xp boosts with normal xp runs are yielding more than that anyway.
---
It's RNG with a big pool that rewards continued play. The lists vary depending on the enemy you kill or the quest you complete, but at the Purveyor the ranged pool has 44-51 weapons with 22 prefixes, 7 major effects, and 8 minor effects. You will usually get junk from her. There is a sale from 9-13 July so start saving now.
---
I’m on PS4. Hope this doesn’t happen!
---
Dont sell yourself short man I no it feels hopeless but even if you only get on for 30 mins a day you could progress rather quickly and I no this may not be realistic for some people but honestly I feel as though they put enough cool stuff at lower ranks that even if you dont finish you should walk away with a few new toys ( I have been waiting for a sink for my bathroom and kitchen forever)
---
We list legendary effects in the order of each star.  25% faster fire rate only occurs on the 2nd star and 25% lower AP cost only occurs on the 3rd star.  Thus, it's basically the placement of the 25s in the acronym.
---
where it starts off as the environment and everything around them is the most dangerous thing and then all of a sudden those are forgotten and the most dangerous thing is humans. ~~*cough cough TWD cough cough*~~
---
Please allow us who have other plans in our lives outside of fallout to earn SCORE as a normal game mechanic for when we do have downtime to play fallout to gain regular consistent SCORE. For example all the other BR battle pass type systems allow this, because this ultimately invites casual players to continue playing much longer over the lifespan of the season. If its a promotional feature, we will of course come back to play during those one or two weeks the first time. But we will not come back again and again. We will learn our lesson the first time that we will only have a 1-2 week window to gain as much SCORE and ultimately failing to get any faster in the game to reach 100. We are not all rich and can afford reaching 100 using the $1.50 feature. We will feel short changed by 10-20 levels and not want to try again pushing extremely hard to play during those 1-2 weeks knowing we will fail again. If this is added as a mechanic it will give us the sense we will make it to 100 just by playing casually even if we don't make it, we know it was because we didn't have enough time because we have a family, work, and other things going on in our lives we couldn't do it. By the end of the season I would feel more of us would feel better using the $1.50 feature to reach out end goal, and not because we felt cheated being held back by the "Limited Time Promotion!". I love this game, but we cannot dedicate our lives to it daily, and feel punished for not having enough time to play every single day.
---
The boys was awesome! Looking forward to season 2!
---
Already fixed it didn't notice I wasn't in fullscreen but still thank you
---
Inspirational. If you're on a team, you want level 3 inspirational or you're missing out on XP which equates to score. Then you can share a different one star perk. Strange in numbers and squad manuevers are great choices.
---
Really? I spoke to her and didn’t notice. Was it something I could have accidentally scrapped?
---
They have been it would seem. I got the firepit a bit ago.
---
But this is different. This is an item where you got a notice saying that it was specifically meant to be crafted, and it appeared in the crafting menu. If you are content to allow them to just pretend like this was just a bug or UI error, that's your choice.  But that's obviously a blatant lie.  It was clearly meant to be crafted, but something went wrong and they just didn't want to bother fixing it.  And they concocted some bullshit story about how it was never meant to be crafted in the first place.
---
Yea but you can make up for it in repeatable and the up coming double day easy enough. It is a struggle to commit daily for 1hour or so to get the dailies done. Day 1 of the week is always a grind to rush weeklies too.
---
Yeah😂😂just do it a few times. Just to get the experience. If u like it, then there ya go, there is your end game content 😂and that’s to keep it fed
---
This is really cool of you. You're trying. As the non owner of the weapon, I appreciate what your efforts.
---
Same here. I'm in for the long haul. :(
---
I don't know what i unlocked for now. Im just bored because don't have any main or side quests. Im doing boring dailies, events... One good thing is from this, more exploring and taking photographs. One day there will be subreddit with my photos 😄
---
Have the plan, need the Str boost more then INT boost. Also need the carry weight from radstag meat otherwise I cannot FT any where.
---
Love The Boys! Did you watch the cast session they did a few days ago?
---
Hmm I doubt. It had a very special name as well. 
---
You would have wondered I imagine
---
If you are content to allow them to just pretend like this was just a bug or UI error, that's your choice.  But that's obviously a blatant lie.  It was clearly meant to be crafted, but something went wrong and they just didn't want to bother fixing it.
---
You don't care about this particular issue, I know, but I hope you are okay with Bethesda not fixing issues and then lying about why. Because sooner or later it will happen with something that you think is important. 
---
And you seriously consider that to be an okay response? Even if it was a bug, people dropped the helmet thinking that they could craft a new one. Now they can't and the helmet is lost forever.  
---
That shouldn't happen, Even if they had not meant for it to be craftable, they should have changed their mind and made it craftable   for that reason alone.
---
Crap! I doubt it will ever show up in a vending machine! Thanks.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll sell you mine.
---
They just drop threw the roof.
---
Well, look at it this way, what's the highest rank of something you are rewarded that you will actually USE. Mine is rank 82, Ghillie SS armor. But after that, if I get it I get it.
---
I will do that tomorrow when I do the event and see if it works
---
Plus you can get that delicious cat meat.
---
I'm on xBox. I'm trying to get used to public teams. They seem kind of useless at the moment. I keep joining event teams and they all just sit in their respective camps doing who knows what, lol. Joined a level 500 something on a hunting team and he kept fast travelling all over the map without so much as a peep. Did have one guy pull a couple legendaries over to me during the Uranium event, which was really cool.
---
Do those ever apply to modules and steel as well? Or only items
---
I'm not even grinding. I'm still just legendary hunting. I see how they've managed to fuck this up too and I just think oh well... Time to get another zealots weapon.
---
(confused screaming)
---
Interesting.   Lots of potential here.
---
But there's no incentive to get people online.
---
If you could save them up a lot of people would do so because you'd be earning towards most of them at the same time.
---
Battlefield5 has/had weekly resets. I played Thursday for a few hours and never opened it again.  If I could get them all in one go, I'd play once a month if that.
---
Oh was it &gt;!her old head!&lt;? I did notice that I had that the other day.
---
I 100% agree. If it had been released in the Wastelanders form, and the CAMP destruction guidelines would have been more clear, (since I'm a buildaholic) I would have been in from day one.
---
Extra info: Logging in before / close to the time the daily challenges reset seems to cause the issue for some people.
---
Yeah I'll try and stay optimistic about that. It is Bethesdas way after all.
---
Loved watching the "Nuka-Break" series on youtube. If it's anything close to that I think it'll be enjoyable
---
share strange in numbers and everything is fine.  
---
just watch out not to share perks that drain radiation like sun kissed or rad sponge. too many bloody builds out there :)
---
There's plenty of things in the game this way.  For me its nuclear winter, I dislike the format and won't play but would like the rewards (Power armor skins) but choose to live with out them.
---
They are a business and to make new content, keep servers up and running they sorta have to make money.
---
Full set of UNY with weight reduction perks, SSunderarmor, 3perks of WR in special, radstag meat, rad ant lager, and just barely FT...so I get the premise I just can't execute your suggestions as it borders on impossible for my fat ass.
---
This right here
---
If you are PC, DM me and I’ll give you one on my character that doesn’t use it.
---
Yes exactly! I just didn’t know how to do that with the text haha. 
---
Has a nice little detail on the back if you haven’t seen
---
Yes you can. On top of that, it doesn't reset the "bond" of team members either.
---
It is being developed by the makers of Westworld so I have high hopes.
---
this is truly honorable behavior. good on you.
---
I was the same, but slowly worked to move points around and have a pretty good build, rifleman as well.  Double XP weekends are great for quickly moving perk points.
---
No I didn't, ill def watch that tonight though. Thx!!
---
They broke rifles and pistols? How so?
---
They may have hit the repeatable more than you. That give 100 points every 10000 xp.
---
That's what double xp weekend is for.
---
Hmmm.  Now I will have something to search for and watch later!
---
I was honestly hoping for a T-51b ghillie skin when I first saw the datamine. It would be complete nonsense, yet thematically perfect.
---
One ticket for the hype train, please.
---
"ok, i just need to turn off the game..."
---
(game closes...)
---
(world turns grayscale, slow motion silent rage screaming, enya's "only time" plays)
---
It included the first 3 mins of S2E1
---
This is what I did
---
I did not. I'll probably wait for the season to start, I don't like to jump too far into that kind of thing until I watch it. I like it too be fresh. It's one of my favorite comics though, and while the show doesn't follow the comic very closely it's still great. I'm excited to see where they take the next season!
---
Ty!
---
Bugged or maybe she leveled up or did seperate quests as well. Most likely a bug as 500 score ain't so easy to get. 
---
Maybe an event although I think those are bugged rn.
---
There's def bugs in the score system though.
---

It's advanced Fallout technology beyond our understanding at this time. One day we'll figure out curcuit boards.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Thank Atom!

Also on PC after you buy or turn in Ammo and it takes you back to the main menu...just hit tab to go back to the last menu you were on.

Perhaps it’s my assassin’s lead pipe?
---
At 15 now, iv been having an issue were people join the events team but dont show up to them which is weird right
---
There's a workshop in The Mire that has 3 copper veins that you can build extractors on, too

Max on queen, Encryptid, rad rumble, 1 star when doing stealth.
---
Wait whats wrong with it?
---
Saw mention of it being in the "near future of America" so possibly Pre-War?
---
Also being worked on by some of the same folks that worked on Westworld.
---
Shows a lot of potential.

How much?
---
How on earth are you already level 34?
---
No ones heard of a cap because I doubt anyone has progressed that far repeatedly.  It is seemingly impossible to get very far because there's a pretty hard cap on how far you can go per day. 
---
I hope there is a cap. If they cap everything except that then fml.
---
Yeah I hope they don’t use the Creation Engine. 
---
Please continue this! Fallout 76 needs more human "NPCs"! Youre doing Atom's work

---
Such teasing!
---
There's also a chance that they'll bring the rewards back if enough of us fail to complete it.   Zombified!
---
I like the sunken train yard north of Fissure prime but that's a good one too!
---
For me, the best thing to come out of the calendar is that I can safely take a break for all of July without missing out on any new content except for SCORE but I can at least choose to spend ATOMs on this in lieu of taking my break.
---
That's kinda weird, I've never experienced that nor done that, I won't buy anything from a vendor unless it's 2-3 star legendary. If I need materials like that to break down I just go to Uranium Fever and loot all the mole miners lol
---
It will certainly help, but it's still not going to allow people to approach the 'content at their own pace', as you will still need to at the very least play the game how they dictate for an hour a day at least over ten weeks. Today has "Kill 3 Cryptid" and "30 Minutes in NW". Even with 1st, to kill the Grafton over and over, and water-sitting in NW, it's taken me over an hour to do both of these.
---
Thanks bud. I’m on Xbox
---
Omg. Cannot wait.  ... as long as Preston isn't in it.
---
I am 12 atm 😀
---

250 points on the first rank

Cool, will i be able to watch it with amazon prime or i'll need another subscription?

Just so people know you CAN add/sell Flamer Fuel to the machine but you CAN'T buy Flamer Fuel from the Machine because of a bug where it's listing 10mm ammo in it's place instead under the Energy Ammo section.
---
Damn, Nolan, all people gonna be synths.
---
I just screamed so loud I think my neighbors know I’m fangirling about something
---
Have you farmed xp by any chance? 😆
---
Does it crash when you click X to log in?
---
It’s his origin story
---
Nice, have you tried the new ammo converter?
---
I'm assuming, and this probably is the case, that instead of fixing the shotgun specifically, properly, they just targeted gauss weaponry globally and reduced their damage by half while using vats. so although the shotgun is still bugged, in practice now it's "fixed".
---
except this bug never affected gauss rifles and pistols. so while using vats they're dealing 25% damage instead of 50.
---
I can’t wait
---
Easy cryptid is toxic larry, all 3 snally gasters there is done in 1 fast travel. Or flooded train yard north of fissure price usually but not always has 6 snallys there.
---
30min NW would be just afk, its total not cumulative if that helps you.
---
I'm skipping NW, because i can crunch 7 repeatables in the weekly which is 700SCORE &gt; 250SCORE for the same time investment. The cryptid with my method is 5min to load and kill. Move on with life.
---
Fireplace Secret-Door as the final and excellent component of my secret Mistress of Mystery lair. FML.
---
Nice, there are many cool rewards in this season, hope we all get to the end 😄👌
---
The real queation 
---
The show will be canon?
---
Wonder if it has as many glitches&amp;bugs as the game 😅
---
There’s going to be a double xp and bonus score weekend this month. Calm down.
---
After doing the math In order to get all the way to the end within the time is to do every single daily and weekly challenge throughout the season, and still only reach about level 90. However you do get 150 atoms I believe 4 times and 500 at the end +100/10000 xp so once you reach the end you’ll be close to being able to buy the rest of the way. But still, almost nobody will be able to grind that much.
---
Pog
---
Logged in 27 minutes after reset and lost 3 challenges worth 1000 points combined.
---
It appears that in addition to the adrenaline perk, both tenderizer and suppressor are not working properly either at the moment.  As far as Gun Fu I know it is switching targets like its supposed to but haven checked to see if the damage is actually increased with consecutive targets.
---
I remember early in WoW you'd have weekly boss battles, sometimes with multiple guilds and the boss would drop one item and you'd have to hit Need or Want, or some nonsense and IF you got it, there was a 98% chance it wasn't what you were looking for anyway...then wait a week and make sure you could log on at X o'clock or miss your chance. Bethesda is cake walk in comparison to many.
---
No release date? Couple years away I guess.
---
...Is anyone else having a problem viewing this?
---
Absolutely no difference, hundreds if not thousands of lines of code written on "accident " , answer being to lie about it and just remove it

---
😡
---
Purchasing said 10mm ammo DOES give you flamer fuel however...
---
Mostly out of curiosity as to whether or not the chapters would be time locked or something similar lol. I really don’t plan on seeing this thing out till the end I think it’s a ridiculous, grindy nightmare.
---
Have you tried loading up a different online game and letting it log in to that games server and then close said game and relaunch fo76?
---
1!
---
Completely by accident, I haven't even looked at the board.  I just did some shit and got some notifications out of nowhere.
---
I might play next season but I'm finally level 45 and I can explore more areas and events without getting slaughtered and I am just into that.
---
It's still playing in a way I normally wouldn't and simply a chore. I would vastly prefer they added small SCORE rewards for completing events, scaling with difficulty, as that way people who play long hours one or two times a week would have a less unpleasant and drawn out series of chores.
---
Who cares as long as it's true to the spirit of the thing.
---
It probably just crashes your prime app
---
Just curious, what kind of \*free awards were you expecting?
---
So sorry to hear that, but good luck.
---
On PC the the inside of my house is always wet and shiny, even if it hasn't been raining outside.
---
11 or 12, between the dailies and weekly and xp grind it doesn’t take too much to rank up so far
---
I haven't tried that. I'll test that out and let you know.
---
Game idea is great , just he company behind it is pathetic at almost everything .
---
Ok good luck!
---
Thank you.  I saw a post about rad sponge.
---
Amazon will send their new drones to your house to tell you they have another episode that needs your attention.
---
Yea do what you can, we'll see how rough it gets come the end. It may only be a few ranks away for a purchase if needed for you. What you earn now discounts what you want later.
---
I think it is kind of fun, since it kind of makes you go places and do things that you might not normaly do! And its free so that is Great aswell 😅
---
Interesting... have you already completed the repeatable weekly challenge of 10k exp once? At the time I noted not getting credit for adventure mode xp from NW I had already done the repeatable weekly challenge multiple times. Or maybe its bugged, wouldn't be the first time lol
---
Well I'll definitely be steering clear then.  Lol
---
Grinding burrows. I mainly did it to satisfy my own curiosity as to whether or not you could just blast right through or it was time locked or something. I don’t plan on going any further tbh.
---
Awesome thanks guys.
---
this is great!  
---
* can you add a way to calculate from the current moment, rather than where we started? It would be nice to be able to enter my current state see how im tracking.
---
* the first weeks weeklies are missing
---
Will it feature the aliens?
---
They wouldn't necessarily need to all be available at the same time. 
---
Say you miss a day, at the minute it's hard luck. Then when you do get chance to get on there's no incentive to play anymore than just doing the dailies that are available. 
---
If they made it so that your missed dailies were still there, and were replaced by the next ones once you completed them, you would have more incentive to stay on longer when you have time to play. 
---
It's probably very much personal opinion but I think games that try to force you to play every day are toxic, especially to the younger players. Every game is going to try to make you to play longer, but forcing shorter but daily play for the rarest items/biggest rewards is feeding (or creating) people's gaming addictions.
---
Completing every daily AND weekly actually doesn’t reach lvl 100. I actually did the math
---
I would be curious how you are leveling up 10x times per day?  Like by stacking multiple Leader Bobbleheads?  I have full unyielding armor with level 30 intelligence and still struggle to level up 1x time a day, playing 2-3 hours.  I can do all the daily challenges, and do 2-3 West Tek runs and that is usually close to getting me up 1 level.
---
What does SCORE stand for though!?
---
Didn’t they patch the godmode glitch with last update ?
---
Nowhere in any of my comments did I say that I agreed with it not being craftable. I was simply pointing out that this is what they have said on the matter. I wanted to try and craft one just like you, I just never made the mistake of scrapping the one I got before coming here to ask about it. I assume they reused the code for the T51b steel mill helmet from the Foundation questline and didn't properly test it, just like everything else they do.
---
Obviously this has upset you quite a bit and you were just looking for other people to be mad with you instead of wanting an actual answer to your initial question.
---
Got a AA gatlin laser that takes care of that trustee real quick.
---
Feel like another double SCORE should be somewhere in mid-August.
---
I'll get to them at some point.  
---
Everyone seems to rush through everything right away.  There's 10 weeks.  Those who finish it within the first 3 weeks will get bored then start coming on the forums moaning.
---
Cool, yeah most of the challenges are very much based on stuff you already do in game so the grind can coexist pretty well if you keep the challenges in mind and play normaly :)
---
They said they did
---
I keep having mine complete without me completing them. The ones u have to do 5 out of a list will complete when I do 3. Unless it's supposed to be that way. If so it shouldn't say steps complete out of 5. I get my rewards so I'm not complaining.
---
Doesn't seem to be, based on  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hixc89/the\_best\_public\_team\_option\_is\_building/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hixc89/the_best_public_team_option_is_building/)
---
Thanks for the info, didn’t see the update.
---
Amended
---
For real my dude, there aren't many people out there who would pick up a dropped legendary, and their first thought is, "damn, I think someone accidentally dropped this, maybe I can find the owner".   I found a dropped wallet at my work, had cash, credit cards, etc.
---
    Checked the guys i.d. and after a bit of searching I found him on facebook and let him know his wallet was safe, and everything was still in it.
---
The armor buffs and ranged damage cards
---
Question I'm asking a lot of people who have said this. 
---
Were you online at refresh time? If not, when you were last online was it in NW?
---
Fuck us with season.
---
Distract us with a new tv series.
---
GG Bethesda
---
Oh thanks a lot!
---
Wow another ploy to lure new players and make more real money huh? Where's the content that is useful for everyone above level 20 ?
---
Typical Bethesda :(
---
Yeah for sure, i have done all beside the Nuclear Winter game mode challenges and one daily but the ranks have been mostly easy now in the begining, lets hope the end isnt that grindy 😅
---
Bethesda's website confirms it's a series from Amazon and Kilter Films. I'm super excited!
---
Les Moves? is that real?
---
Great, another game for Bethesda to focus on instead of fallout 76
---
I was last online yesterday and no I wasn't on at refresh time
---
I shouldn’t have 4 characters with max caps. Where’s the bank. Put it in white spring
---
A gentleman and a scholar. I lift a glass to you sir.
---
No, this does not fix the grind, but considering we can't do anything on our end to change that right now, it's is still a kind, helpful thing to let people know.
---
Well I logged in to 3 of my dailys for today being the ones I completed yesterday including the complete 5 other challenges
---
The Hunts' brand cooperation looks to offer fantastic services for all levels and furthermore looks to take care of aspiring hunters who may just need a little help as they scramble for .38
---
Guys from west world are doing it. Should be good if you aren’t a complete lore freak.
---
I'm insanely excited about this.
---
Did you include the double SCORE weekend that they're going to be doing? Because that's, effectively, just giving 4 extra sets of dailies which is enough to get you over the line.
---
Annoying that it doesn't accept plasma cores.  Tried converting some yesterday and wasnt sure why I couldn't find the option.  Looks like it's because it doesn't take them at all.
---
&gt; I just never made the mistake of scrapping the one I got before coming here to ask about it.
---
I never scrapped it either because I never assumed that they would fix it. And they didn't.
---
Feel free to google him for yourself
---
Yeah 😅 heard of a guy that was already lvl 100 🤯 he aperantly used the new god mode method, stacked alot of buffs then got an insane amount of xp which led him to complete the repetable xp one to max rank of 100.
---
Yep 3 dailies worth 1000 points auto completed.
---
I'm calm and this is only a suggestion. The double xp events are fine for the most of us. But many have to work on weekend.
---
They expect you to play pretty much everyday to get to 100. If you really try you can grind it faster. Why did they making it like that if the rewards are so bad.
---
I'm fine with bad rewards, but making us play the game like a job for bad rewards, no thanks. There are much better games to play.
---
Take for instance, Destiny 2. I can comfortably stop playing the game for a week and still know I can get to 100 in the season. THAT is how it should be. Why the fuck are people just accepting the fact they have to play the game like it's a job?
---
Choo chooo 🚂
---
That still isn’t enough, sorry. If they did like 15 double score weekends it would be. But you’d still have to do every challenge including nuclear winter
---
We can hope. Or one right before the end for a big push or something like that.
---
Synths!
---
i will. just seems like an odd name in relation to what you said. like, he's got Less Moves than me on the dance floor so he finds another way to take advantage.
---
When you were online yesterday was your last game in Nuclear Winter?
---
u/valseek do you know what S.C.O.R.E stands for?
---
Definitely an improvement, and seems to be well implemented so far.
---
Wait i didn't notice. Adrenaline doesn't work at all after p20?
---
I'm gonna switch to enforcer then for the time being.
---
If you have Game pass ultimate, Fallout 76 is being added very soon which I imagine will
---
Mean you can just pick up the game on PC when it’s added!
---
Check out the below link that explains it all
---
[Fallout 76 on Game Pass Ultimate](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates)
---
At first I thought the bug happens when you are online during the reset... Looks like it's not the case. 
---
Did you complete all challenges yesterday? Including the NW challenge daily?
---
Does this apply to PS4 and XBox One  or is this problem primary PC?
---
They did  it theres a workaround that's easier
---
It’s tv. It will probably be 80-90%.
---
Fuck us with seasons.
---
You can't transfer characters or move it to PC.
---
Another double SCORE in mid-August would be perfect... *\*whistles\**
---
INB4 They turn ghouls into regular zombies and super mutants into regular mutant humans...
---
The teams are for extra SPECIAL levels and xp. My GT is AWoodinPickle.  FR me of you want to. I'll roll with you. I like to create Builder teams. The xp you get when fully bonded is outstanding and will help you level my dude. That and you can spray and spray from a distance and I'll murder them be4 they get to you lol.
---
14, chugging away slowly at it
---
I'm having difficulty determining if you're being sarcastic and honestly believe that all objects in the game are always loaded into memory or if there's some other point you're trying to make. Just because you can see the map on the map screen doesn't mean that every object that could potentially exist on that map is already being rendered.
---
I'm pretty sure there's mention of them starting to hoard technology in their dealings with The Responders as well although I could be misremebering since it's been awhile since I did all those quests and trying to catch all the story off holotapes that don't have adjustable volume is hard
---
Holy hell. If this is real, sign me up.
---
They also lied about the Radicals Mask. They knew about it for 6 months in the PTS, released it for 1 month, a few posts pop up saying they would never buy any kind of AS mask if it couldn’t go over the radical mask. Next patch Legendary effects are gone “not intended to be legendary” and 2 weeks later Fasnacht Masks started selling in the AS
---
And they have zero incentive to change their ways.    Threads like this pointing out Bethesda's lies and  pointing out actual broken game mechanics get down voted and blitzed with comments defending their nonsense.
---
I was sceptical before it came out but now after 2 sessions i cant imagine the game without it. There is plenty to improve tho
---
I withdraw from the conversation. We are at an impasse. You are simply incorrect in almost every counter you made in that post. The amount of education you require is beyond the effort I am willing to expend on a reddit argument.
---
Is it not loading for anyone else?
---
To be fair, it was something you had to pay for in real money and getting it for free would make it pointless for the people who bought the pack.
---
Nice 👌 i am not rushing it yet atleast, got ten weeks to do it on so i am doing it slow and relaxed 😅 no need to rush to 100 the first day 😆
---
All in good time, member.
---
They should do it, math and compensate with atoms to level up on the board.
---
I used to live down from larrys at the camp ground before they made it a quest area in wild Appalachia. Still miss it fiercly. Great fuckin spot.
---
Your tip worked. Thank you!
---
Glad I'm aware of that option now.
---
Nope I completed all dailys besides nuclear winter ones
---
You might not find your remark so humorous if you spend 10 minutes reading about the dude
---
I have the t65 plan and I still can't add the RR Jet Pack even though I bought it and I have the materials.  Message says, "Buy in Atom Store".  But there is shows that I HAVE purchased it. Frustrated.
---
That would work too.
---
IMO eventually fallout 1st members will get higher max bullion, scrip, build budgets and maybe even caps.
---
Were they involved in the movie Book of Eli? Imo that is by far the closest thing to a Fallout type Wasteland in a big budget movie.
---
Thanks lol. I'll get there without too much issue, as I'm subbed, and can use my 'free' Atoms to catch up if I fall short. As noted below I just wish there were alternate advancement avenues.
---
Your'e gonna love it. It opens up a lot of possibilities. Not just walls, but with everything.
---
You brought that grind on yourself this early, it is entirely unnecessary.
---
you're most likely correct.
---
I've been playing 3ish hours per day, just hit Rank 15
---
Its a bit buggy, but im happy so long as they dont auto complete without the rewards
---
Only 5000 atoms per episode! And in season 2 they might even introduce actors!
---
the menus are horse shit too. you cant exit the terminal unless you select Go back to main menu..
---
im waiting for people to hit higher tiers before i decide to try to rush or not, i wanna know if score/tier caps out
---
I'd like to say thanks for putting it in! It needs a little tuning, but it's still a positive addition to the game.
---
On par for 100 keep it up! I hope they give bonuses for additional score after rank 100 but idk.
---
Yeah. All my characters are soulless killing machines with 1 or 2 charisma.
---
Well they fixed that now. Congratulations, your 20 dollars are not to be wasted.
---
Ahh the FO1st atoms...everyday I tell myself I should get that, and then i see the price tag and go NOOOO GOD PLEASE NOOOOOO.
---
Ha! It'd be nice! 😂
---
Im surprises we are taking about moms. I dont know any women over 40 who playes any kind of video games. With Man its diffrent but still very nichee here.
---
just about to hit 11, and ive not really been grinding. just doing the dailies and weeklies as they come and the odd event here and there
---
been enjoying nuclear winter recently (bush wookies ftw) so im glad of the challenges on there to do as well. and the return of stuff i missed last time round like the gillie suit
---
I'm always glad to help lowlevels! Add me on Xbox @ Zug Vordanai and we can get down to having fun.
---
I think what we’re all wanting , well, what I wanted was the mechanic from vegas where you can break down ammo at a bench and turn the components into other things
---
Yeah, seems like it increases with 25 score with each rank, hopefully it stops before rank 100 😅 that would mean the last rank would require 3500 score 🙃
---
Wait really? I didn't try it because I didn't want to waste points on 10mm ammo
---
They added a bunch of random encounters to those pools making getting a pet even more of a chore.
---
Well I could argue that playing this game almost every day for ten weeks is pretty unnecessary too. Just because I chose to get grindy right out of the gate doesn’t mean it would be any less grindy otherwise. I regret nothing.
---
I’ve got a theory I’m testing today.
---
All my characters were logged in before 8 pacific.  I logged off and stopped playing.  All previous days challenges were done.
---
I played a bit 8 to 9 yesterday, and the challenges I completed may line up with things I was doing in game (legendary kill, level up, and the total daily challenge).
---
If you are playing between 8 and 9 perhaps you are completing the challenges before they go live.  That is, they are live at 8, the normal time, but they don’t show til 9, which is something new and odd as the reset used to be 8.
---
This is Bethesda.  Crazier things have happened.
---
For me personally, I’m not playing it like a job. I just PLAY and do my own thing in the Wasteland, and if I earn score - great! If I don’t, no big deal. I will probably casually grind some easy daily’s, but I agree I’m not going to let this be a job. I guess, I’m just not a completionist like some players.
---
Well there goes my theory. Thanks for replying.
---
There are already people who have finished via abusing gm.
---
They either auto completed with no reward or are from yesterday when I got my rewards
---
I guess that's a potential concern.  If it happens I might cash out the atoms I've accumulated for one season, then give up during the next.
---
I don’t care who’s in the lead. I just need to overtake that &amp;@$! Zorbo
---
How can I “claim” it?
---
I logged off around 7 pm yesterday
---
No problem
---
Rumors said it’s a film about Preston traveling through the wasteland, re-establishing the Minutemen and rescue some settlements.
---
geez. i didn't finish the article, but some of the stuff he said... Can I go back to thinkin this was some shitty joke about dancing? I know sweeping under the rug is bad, but it's a bad day, sir/ma'am
---
like?
---
The Ammo Converter?
---
Both of them are main goals for me, but there is so much I want!
---
I love cosmology and Alien shit.
---
For fuck sake... unless you're skipping daily challenges, and even  then only if you're skipping so many, you DO NOT HAVE TO GRIND.
---
If you're doing the daily challenge anyway to level up then that's all you need to do for the repeatable exp challenge.  No going through west tek, clearing out every super mutant, server hopping and then repeating for the next ten weeks.  Just  by doing the level up challenge you're going to be earning enough exp to complete the repeatable challenge for an extra 1100 points a week minimum which if combined with all the other daily and weekly challenges will let you reach rank 100 weeks before the season ends.
---
Nice, yeah i am not a big fan of the NW mode normaly but i do the limited time stuff somewhat each time, heard there is a bug where you can now get closed limited time rewards at the end of some rounds.
---
Murdering a L1 Scavenger (*FOR SCIENCE!*)
---
Unexpected and hilarious. I'm going to make a shrine in my camp to all the unsung heroes of Appalachia that have been scienced.
---
I'm compensated some by taking Gun-Fu up to rank 3, but it doesn't help much (15 agility points isn't enough to go around).
---
That is weird. I am able to apply mine now after I learned the plan but noticed there’s a lot of broke stuff on that menu currently after patch 20. I was able to apply the dark matter cosmos jet pack (or whatever it’s called) and also a camouflaged jetpack option on the arms (which doesn’t apply the jetpack like it would on ultracite armor, but only the camouflage skin). I wasted a lot of flux trying these options. A lot is screwed up rn.
---
It's in my vendor right now for 1200 caps, unless you want to buy it for more :P
---
The queen of the hunt daily also guarantees a cryptid if the snallygasters are already dead.
---
Hit 9 last night. Between that and the other grinds, it's a lot! Honestly, I dont have a lot of play time. Maybe an hour a day.
---
Shut up and take my upvote!
---
sorry that was a typo
---
The Book of Eli was an amazing movie. Definitely one to watch again.
---
The last time i played fallout 4 where i was really enjoying it was 4 years ago. I didnt have a pc at that time and was in uni thus my parents are willing to shell out. Low and behold i found fallout 4 on a net cafe next to my uni plus saving features. It was a blast and the first time i played fallout 4.
---
After 76 without the NPC i was extremely disheartened and did not play but the hope of wastelanders brought me.back as well and experiencing even in its vanila parts reminded me.of my joy 4 years ago. I agree fully, felt the sense of longing and as someone been here i would just like to say welcome back.
---
Glad to know i wasnt the only one lost now once again found.
---
Yup! I’m just not sure why I got downvoted to hell for pointing it out tho...
---
I am not defending what they did with the radicals mask. They lied about that too.  But with the Father Winter helmet, you  given  ***two very clear indicators*** not once, but TWICE, that the Father Winter helmet was  intended to be crafted.
---
ok thank you this helps has helped me
---
Welcome to freemium ware.
---
And exactly how many dupe methods have they also patched? Exactly.
---
Thanks! LVL 200+ and I didn't know about the Burrows, I just thought it was part of Harpers ferry.
---
I wish I had your luck.  I rushed to rank 5 on my lunch break and I set it up and starting using it and was like "WHY?!!?!?"
---
 [u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek/), [u/Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ladydevann/) any chance you could confirm if this is a bug or expected behavior?
---
I have one if you want it
---
Demolition broke aswell
---
Its not to bad on XBOX. It remembers you last selection so you just spam A for.
---
it is pretty sad that the Sink is probably the thing i want most out of this too, and i don't mean that in a degrading way to the other items.... i just wanted a darn sink for so long!
---
A spare?
---
Because it extends play time without having to create more content
---
Yes, is it something available in the Atom shop that I need to get before it goes away?
---
Yeah, i havnt had time to play much either, but hopefully the challenges stock to how they are now as they are not to difficult 😅
---
They hope you don't notice how little enjoyable content there actually is if they keep you busy with the mundane.
---
Not entirely true. My grandma turned into a vase.
---
None. Bethesda flopped this game from the beginning. Although they have made some positive steps in the right direction since. I also pre ordered the tricentennial edition and have felt the sting ever since. I think the best thing to take away from this is to never......ever, ever,ever, evvvveeerrrrrr pre order another game, ever again!
---
Amen, he's on chapter two. How'd he use the damn worm hole already...
---
Yea we won't talk about them...
---
The main ting im thinking is being able to specify what you want from your team. For example a little box where you can write a small amount of words. Like i dont want to play in a team only the want The benefits from being in one, looking for a group to grind events with, looking for group to do scorched earth, encrypted. Things like that
---
Awesome. Glad it worked.
---
Yeah, it doesn’t make too much sense. If somebody wants the salute they can buy the pack. The power armor paints or weapon paints for the pack weren’t in the atom shop, so why should the same emote be?
---
If you want i could act as a ps4 liaison. Have the radstag knife, treasure hunter and insurgent outfits. Leather armor is pretty cheap to make at low levels and have the majority of weapons unlocked for crafting. I do similar things when i see a low level at the vault or around flat woods.
---
Just thought i could offer to help out, dont have the time to organize something like this but doing a few deliveries shouldn't be too much of a burden
---
Perfect!    Thanks.   I'm actually learning that i simply need to complete some quests to unlock plans and such.   Someone mentioned The Fixer...looked it up and looks like something i'd want...however, i need to complete some quests first.   I've been lacking there choosing rather to grind and build my camp and such.   But this is why i like this game....the possibilities are endless.
---
It's not even pay to win though, you get no XP and you only get minimal junk items or non perishables. The time it takes to get the stuff it collects, you can farm probably 5 times that in a single dungeons given you scrap everything with the Scrapper perk.
---
And they specifically said the masks were to have legendary effect , then they pulled back and lied
---
Oh. It is part of the new Season One challenge. It it rank 5 I believe. You complete daily and weekly challenges to get it. It is available until early to mid September so you have plenty of time.
---
It'd just look like all those games with hacked leaderboards where #1 is at 999999999999 score which isn't exactly a great look for Bethesda.
---
I can't even figure out where it is in the build menu ahah. It's such a mess.
---
8 after about 2.5 hours.
---
What I think makes no difference to the mode obviously, I just believe they are leaving it fallow to mop up all the PVP effluent that oozes from Adventure mode 🤮
---
Genuinely, you can get to level 100 just playing the game the way you normally do. I understand if you can't or don't want to play every day, but grinding to level 34 just from "get 10000 XP" challenges for 100 score points and then complaining about grind is completely contradictory. Just play the game normally and you won't have to grind as much. People really are panicking over absolutely nothing in regards to this season.
---
I'll second that. Really got screwed by Ubisoft on Division 2.
---
How do I get to your vending machine
---
In the meantime you should watch the (pretty much) free tv shows / series on youtube like Fallout: The Wanderer or Fallout: Nuka Break made by fans years ago.
---
I'm excited for a show directly from Bethesda, but also having to pay for yet another streaming service is a little annoying.
---
The sweetest meat of all
---
Very underrated movie! Always a good film by Denzel, and that was VERY good!
---
Nice 👌 idk how much time i have used on them, but probably somewhere around 2 hours aswell 😁
---
Not a spare but I have one if you want it
---
Oh come on,  all god cards are banned!!!
---
That's it , you're full of shit,  I'm taking my teenage boy's body and going home !!!
---
Also its illegal to have someone helping during a tournament  byyyyyyyeeeeeee....
---
Man that is a  deep voice for a  14 year old,  my god .
---
Honestly the best version is going to be a Fallout 4-esque intro where we spend 50% of episode 1 in Retro-Futuristic October 2077, 49% in Vault XX and then the last 5 minutes in 2277ish in Wherever Wasteland and then episodes 2-13 Character, Story and World Building in the 'present' with a heaping helping of flashbacks to prewar and vault life.
---
Power Armor should be viable throughout though, otherwise what's the point only having it to level 50 maybe 60? With double xp weekends, you can get a new character from 2 to 50 no problem.
---
Guessing the issue stems from the Helmet originally being planed to be a Atom Shop item (it was in the Atom files a few updates ago). And when it was moved over to a event reward they forgot to remove its Craft data so it is likely is possible they didn't intend it to be craft-able.
---
Just tried it out.
---
"Progression
---
TL;DR You will run out of time."
---
RIP me.
---
I’m literally not complaining about the grind though? I said it was grindy and I don’t plan on finishing it. Stop reaching lol.
---
Well the nerfed/ruined magnetic personality so
---
I’ll give you 2000 for helping but I’ve not sure how to get to you. What’s your gamer tag
---
I'm unable to load the article at all. Wish OP copy/pasted the content instead of simply throwing the link on here.
---
It’s very kind of you, but I would like you to keep your only one
---
I’m pretending it still works.
---
There was no good reason to remove the legendary effect for those who had gotten them on  the masks.  They could have gotten rid of legendary effects for future drops and the legendary masks could be "legacy masks."  Stripping away the legendary effect was a dick move no doubt.
---
Toxic Larry's is one of my fave locations. Check the fridge and inside the pot on the stove for up to three squirrel bits for tasty squirrel stew; there's a spawn for a magazine on the bed on the second floor; there's a spawn for a bobblehead on the metal shelves on the roof; check out the nearby outhouse back and to the right for another potential magazine spawn and a level 3 locked safe hidden mostly underground. You can see just the top edge of it poking out.
---
The Brotherhood used US Dollars in FO Tactics but I guess that wouldn’t work well with so much useless pre-war money everywhere now
---
So, if BOS is in chicago looking for reach vault 0 to defeat the presidential IA...is fine for you?
---
Lol...
---
Grafton Monster as well if you are a lower level. Server hopping Charleston Station or doing the event at Grafton is pretty quick
---
yeah i wish i had done some research when i started this game.    But when i started it was kinda boring going from one recording to another to follow some story line...so i quit.  When Wastelander was introduced I came back and now it's way cooler.    Way more fun.
---
It's actually Les Moonves (pronounced like Moon Vest without the 't')
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Moonves
---
Haha very real
---
I mean, I had 450 points in the battle pass when I logged into adventure for the first time after doing NW all day; so that's the 250 NW achievement, and 2 10k adventure mode XP ones, unless there was some other way of getting battle pass points in NW besides the single challenge
---
As long as they don’t have the Vault Dweller doing the nasty with a ghoul as a plot point again...
---
I mean they are called daily challenges and if you race through it, I bet you'd come right back here to complain about there not being any content and what's the wait about. So sit down, take your 150 atoms and wait like a good boy.
---
Why was I downvoted for answering the question? Lol
---
You sure? I have no use of it. I just had seen it and grabbed it. If you posted about yours in sure you truly loved it and I’d be glad to give you mine
---
Yea I guess why they gotta ruin everything...If only there were a way to filter/ban the hackers and exploit abusers...
---
I think this is pretty bad ass, I’m looking forward to this
---
Yes, i figured that out in my search, but thanks for stating in case anyone else is wanting to look this up.
---
They really should have made it craftable though, regardless of whatever the original intent was. I didn't scrap mine, but there were others who did who thought they would have the ability to craft a new one. And that is Bethesda's fault, not the fault of whoever scrapped their helmet.  For that reason alone they should have made it craftable.
---
Yea the xp and weapon skins were the main attraction to me lol
---
Is it just the xp you're grinding? I don't think there's anything else to grind
---
Yeah dude, you can keep it! It’s very nice of you to offer though, I posted more to see if this was a widespread issue and bring some light onto it more
---
If you’re on PS4 I’ll stay in your team. Having the same issue myself
---
Watched both, not bad for out of pocket budget.
---
May i ask what your strat is ?
---
Sure thing, well if you ever still want it the offer will be there
---
I'm just gonna play like normal tbh, you can still get the end result if you put a little focus towards challenges. I mean I want to experience the content, not rush through it and have nothing else to do like what happened after Wild Appalachia or even Wastelanders main story.
---
Yep, keeps asking me to choose a language, both on PC and mobile, so it's on Beth's end.
---
Sorry, i forgot the sarcasm(tm) disclaimer.
---
Wish it gave you eggs or something instead of fertilizer, though. :( Still-- it's cute as a skin.
---
You got it brother. Keep it real man
---
Lucky. My goal is 100 and then to promptly quit doing any future seasons out of frustration. Hope it is worth it.
---
waited for challenges to reset and when they did half of them were already completed.
---
Just to update everyone I hit 46 hours playtime today and just finally heard another player, it only took 45 hours lmao
---
I hope they look more to fallouts 1 and 2 for the aesthetic rather than Bethesda's hyper focus on 50s America
---
The worst is the bow they don’t work for the compound bow almost the same exact thing but I would have to agree 100% especially for 500 atom
---
I want that fucking planetarium light _so bad_. I could give less than a shit about any of the other level 100 rewards. But they nabbed me with that ooh sparkle shiny.
---
I wish this happened on PS4. Nobody I buy this game for will play it lol(3 people so far). 
---
I figure if EVERYONE was playing though since it’s free maybe some of the gang would try it again. Haha.
---
Written by someone that has loved and been a part of every iteration of the franchise.  Well said.  I agree, it's a quirky, sometimes clunky and unpredictable game.  However, Wastelanders righted so many wrongs, the main story is actually REALLY good, and being able to play with my friends that have been Fallout geeks for over 20 years is something we dreamed about around the Fallout 2 days.
---
I'm glad to hear you are getting so much joy out of the game. I had the exact same thought when I reloaded the game to give Wastelanders a try, "It's good to be back".
---
Cheers!
---
I personally had the weekly challenge of building items in camp or workshop complete with no reward. I completed it in a workshop, not my camp if that matters.
---
Xbox!
---
I posted in a previous thread about how everyone should relax and how a double score weekend could help and hey, here it is. And I really don’t see the issue with the Ammo converter. It remembers the ammo you want to convert to points and you just spam X. Why are people upset about that?
---
these were completed for me too.
---
I'm sure they will fix it... but at what cost..
---
Gauss weapons only general have received a nerf because there was a bug affecting them, making them do way more damage than intended.
---
I’ve had the same thing happening
---
The Responders warn each other regularly that Brotherhood tends to be pushy and try to take stimpaks and ammo on the grounds that they “need it more” since they’re fighting the Scorched directly, which the Responders aren’t aware of since they had no presence in the Cranberry Bog. This could easily escalate over time to having the same attitude about anything particularly useful in the wasteland, i.e. all advanced technology.
---
Just speculation but it makes sense to me.
---
Me too - auto completed 3 quests (250, 250, 500) with no increase in score total.
---
Also claimed I'd killed 1/3 crypids.
---
I did log out at 5pm here (when they usually reset) and when I logged back on (6pm) they were showing as completed.
---
To test if it was just UI bug, I then tried doing them (completed 2 events) but this didnt change anything.
---
I then tried getting 10k xp to see if they would be credited the next time SCORE was added. It doesnt.
---
As above, cant report via help page since thats down for maintenance.
---
Same, also having problems.
---
Answering my own question, in case anyone else was wondering: YES, THIS STILL IS WORKING. I just got the glow-in-the-dark skeleton about 30 minutes ago.
---
I only see one double SCORE event, why are people mention "weekends"? Did I miss something?
---
I love your kindness, even when it’s not reciprocated. I’ve also had the same experiences although I have a problem with just scaring away new players, or them not understanding I’m leaving them a gift so they don’t pick it up. I don’t use a mic so it’s challenging sometimes.
---
comparing Fallout 76 with jewelry is kind of funny.
---
Yes i see you point, but then again it's just another standard excuse of the industry: "It's just optional"
---
It's different textures for different models, so that's a lot more art work. I wouldn't hold your breath (certainly not for keeping it the same price).
---
This is awesome! I always wanted a New Vegas series. This will be epic!
---
weekend**S**? there is only 1 listed.
---
I was a little iffy on it being Online only and MP, especially with PvP aspects. (It's Bethesda there will be bugs and exploits and people will use them, after all.) I also feared it would be like ESO, a good MMO, for consoles, but not an ES game.
---
I preordered it from Gamestop with a $5 deposit.
---
When I got selected for the stress test, I jumped right in and fell in love!
---
2.2k+ hours, probably 2k of that solo, and I still love it! The public teams are pretty nice. I start a building team for the Intel buff, we share perks, and off we go to do our own thing!
---
I'm getting a little annoyed with performance issues and game instability, but when you continously have people exploiting glitches, of course the game engine, which is fairly shitty on it's own, is going to have issues. Beth NEEDS to crack down on that.
---
Welcome and enjoy your time in WV!
---
You know, I'd be totally down with it being based on 76. So we see pre-War life, we see Vault life, and then we get introduced to the Wasteland.
---
Yes Ward Garvey is the most annoying NPC since preston and every bit as glitchy, I honestly think they are using the same AI.
---
Makes me wish they would get rid of the 'humanoid' NPCs and give us back just the robots, the Robot NPCs didn't run around all over the map or go to bed and not get up, or fail to see that you have the item you were sent to retrieve. 
---
How about this let us get and return our daily quests from the terminal at our camps?
---
If there's no Ink Spots I'm gonna be ANGRY!
---
Got a Christmas wreath, a tree, and a couple holiday weapon skins yesterday and this morning.
---
Honestly they should have made it like the Blade of Bastet, Voice of Set, and Garb of Mysteries where if you have one you can "Craft" it to be a higher level. When it showed up in the craft menu that's what i expected.
---
It would be fine if the ap cost was very heavy so it couldn't get spammed constantly they may as well just add more tesla rifles and the fatman if they're going to let people do that.
---
I thought magic effects were still alive and kicking
---
We don’t have slide bars for anything but trading. To my annoyance.
---
Click your portrait in the top right corner, there should be an option to convert to public if you're the leader.
---
https://i.imgur.com/swpNK6V.jpg in case you need a visual.
---
I just hope they don’t base it on any of the games, if they don’t it would be pretty hard to fuck it up but if they do it is almost certainly going to be shitty
---
Can you update the post for:
---
&gt; The total you will get from dailies is 2000.
---
To have version for 1750? Because not all people are fans of NW.
---
Thats a cool idea. I always thought when playing Fallout 4. This in the Fallout 76 worldspace (which i think is beautifull, the best Bethesda has done so far) would be great. Hell i would love to have a Fallout 4 dlc or mod which lets you play in Appalachia.
---
Awsome! I need to Check this bug out 😅👌
---
tbf after so long humans are the only threat. There has to be some conflict but the zombies aren't as scary when the main characters are behind 50 foot walls living in the suburbs with running water lol
---
I found him asleep in bed and was like "We talked about this buddy.  You sleep at your desk now."
---
He seemed unconcerned. Might have been he's preoccupied with all that missing equipment.
---
As an adult with many responsibilites, I unfortunately do not have the luxury of playing enough to complete all dailies, NW tasks, let alone leveling up at a ridiculous pace to keep up.. at least the double XP and double SCORE days will be coming up in a couple weeks, so maybe I'll focus on that. 
---
Before any of these MATH posts came up, I had a feeling that Bethesda would somehow "coerce" people into the ATOM purchasing to get to 100. It turns out they completed that very mission, by leaving no room for imperfect attendance. At least in some other games, there isn't as much of a time crunch, or at least the time crunch isn't limited to such a cap on progress.. 1 extra week would REALLY help.. but alas, I may only make it part-way through the board.
---
I can put one together for you on XBox :) ZforZombies2016
---
Yes, the game punish you if you play the way you want.
---
The game forces you to do what they want. But i dont want all these cosmetics from season pass.
---
I want to get powerfull finishing my secret service armor.
---
I finally talked to another player today! It only took 45 hours and a reinstall that i have no idea if it helped lol
---
Are you in game now
---
Some of the bulldozer functionality being broken after Wastelanders is a known issue, but I don't know if this is part of that. Did you validate that it worked post-Wastelanders but pre-patch 20?
---
Considering 3 and 4 were the start for the majority of the current "fandom", and the most striking visually, expect it to be the 50s aesthetic through and through
---
But with none of the fun/comedy; extra dark+gritty needlessly, oh and also feeling nothing like a fallout storyline.
---
Because that's just good tv or something these days i suppose
---
Well you could if their support page wasnt down (that and the last guy that submitted a ticket for the same issue yesterday got told "lol cant do anything about it")
---
I either had 3 carry over from yesterday or they autocompleted with no reward and I have a cryptid kill one that is at 1 haven't killed a cryptid
---
Time it takes, arbitrary amount to go through, and everyone mostly had high hopes and their own idea of what it was going to be. Spamming x sure but then if you have 100 .38 even and spam for 5-6 times do you turn into a zombie and for get and then start converting your .45 ammo? Now you wasted it. I think it could be much better.  Vendor like interface or even something like the brewing fermentation chamber where you put X rounds in and over time X "ammo scrap" is made and you use that to craft your ammo. Bonus points if it scales and they let us use super duper with it and ammo perks.
---
As long as Bethesda has nothing to do with it then it's probably gonna be pretty decent
---
It didn't take two years to get to Wastelanders, still got a few months to get there.
---
The Vanilla story was fine for the starting point. I'm loving watching WV grow and change, which is the WHOLE premise of the game.
---
If the story is good, it doesn't have to match up with the games.  I really don't give a rat's ass.
---
:O
---
Can you add numbers for case without NW daily?
---
Travel to hemlock holes, turn south, fire whatever your strongest area of effect weapon is, 2 dead snallies and a grafton monster
---
You'll have to update us on how many liars message you.
---
Plus free caps whenever anyone in the team finishes a quest! So even having lower levels on your team give a bonus!
---
Thank you!!
---
Don't sleep on the lunchboxes
---
Heart is easy enough dont know why more people dont do it, Awol though has those damn Armor piercing (more like ignoring) Gutsy's though so i tend to avoid it unless a group is there.
---
Yea they are, but there was one with just Gauss weapons. The limb/bash/hitchance magic stuff still works though.
---
Ditto this. I went to someone's camp and saw they had one up, so I decided to try it before I buy it. Yeah it was annoying, sure it's probably because I was only converting the like 50 10mm I had on my person at the time, but I think because I had spent all day reading about its many terrors that it set my expectations so low that the very fact that it just worked seemed like a reason to shrug my shoulders and utter 'meh'. 
---
Signed, the 12 shotguns shell I received for whatever junk ammo was living in in the bottom of my plushy mothman backpack.
---
seems like they should have spent the millions of dollars fixing their games and developing new tech for them but whatever.
---
hope it'll be good i guess, probably a few years away at this point.
---
I hope it's less focused on some major threat or singular story and is instead more focused on small stories about post-apocalyptic world, factions and creatures. One large story was never the big draw of Fallout. The world is.
---
Hi, just wanted to acknowledge that we've seen some reports on this and we are investigating. This was meant to be addressed in Update 20. Will share more info as soon as I hear it. Thank you!
---
Yea it’s a clunky interface but i don’t think it’s as bad as everyone is saying. It’s kind of useless imo, you can run through West tek or something and get enough scrap to make ammo on our own, in less time. I guess it’s just something to do with .38 and .44 bullets.
---
Right dude my bathroom and kitchen just looked weird without one
---
I'm not sure what there is to talk about, most of these events have been in since launch and every update has tried more and more to push us to keep playing the same old things over and over to get missiles and grenades. If you are going to make me take pictures of the same items every day, at least reward otherwise rare consumables such as legendary modules (or a new type of legendary module - maybe one that changes an effect), or allow all of these things to reward legendary items, like 'lucky find' or 'faschnact day'
---
Daguerre daily quest: I know Beckett not giving daily quest was an issue, but did anyone notice Commander Daguerre is no longer giving daily quest?  I haven't received a quest since Patch 20.  
---
Enemy Corpse Glitch: I noticed some enemy corpses would be glitched (fall though ground, stuck standing and not lootable, etc) on the first day of the patch.  It's always been there since wasterlander, but it was a bit different.  I was clearing ghouls in whitespring.  I sniped two ghouls from a distance via VATS.  The one ghoul's corpse fell through the pouch where it stood and the other (legendary) got stuck standing.  Bloody mess broke up the body parts, but you cannot see the loot window when pointing at the parts.  After like a few minutes of scanning through with my mouse, I was able to interact with the loot window, but the cursor is no on the corpse parts at all.  Never seen anything like it.
---
Public team: I started a public team, and a teammate asked if I can switch the team goal.  The note said it can be changed by the team leader in the Social menu, but I didn't see the option for it.  I am not sure if it's just me.  I tried to see if I can disband the team and start a new one, but didn't see the option for that.  I had to jump out of the server and back in, which loses my newfound teammates.
---
Isn't it cool. The told in an inside the Vault a few months ago how they want to make the challenges more "fun".
---
Like alway fun translated to english means money. I really hope the don't want to add another layer of "fun" soon....
---
You have a valid point. But at least I don’t have to deal with hundreds of bugs either
---
Wait... it's a race?
---
Is this true? Explosive weps no longer providing additional damage?
---
NW Christmas and Halloween challenges were brought back, either intentionally or by accident.
---
Yep, until you factor in fluxes
---
It's the only thing they did correctly.
---
Then your math must be flawed. The consensus has been that it requires 220k to hit 100 based on each level requiring 25 more than the last. 10 sets of weeklies and 70 dailies gets you to 215k, the extra you get from the double SCORE weekend will get you up to 223k.
---
Zorbo is whoopin you then ;)

Switch to Gun Fu until they fix it.

I'm casual as fuck, and it takes me not even an hour to do the dailies. People need to stop complaining about not being able to play for an hour - okay, you have no time, so why in the world are you even worrying about the rewards?

I've mentioned this in other threads, but we are actively working on a fix for this. I don't have details about the timing for that fix just yet, but will let you know once we do. Thanks for the reports!

I swear SS is weighted towards Unyielding.

Just started the other day on Xbox one and hit level 30 this evening, these would have been an awesome thing to start off with shame no ones doing this on Xbox haha.
---
Damn, that's my life everyday at my camp. Power armor jet pack jumps from the roof.
---
Honestly. Have you people never played a game like this before? Nearly every game i've played like this caps you in some way to stop you just ripping through the content in a few days or weeks. 
---
And if there was no limit to scrip and caps the people who play 16 hours a day would be able to grind/buy legendaries and trade them in and then try and get those god roll legendaries. And then once they have those god rolls they can then charge silly money for them. But because there's no cap limit they ask for 1 million caps for something you would pay 50k for now. And the only people who can afford to buy the stuff they want to sell are the other people who play 16 hours a day. Eventually the prices go through the roof and your average player wont be able to buy anything as they only have 50000 caps.
---
Oh Hi Marklar
---
Yea its probably because they are juggling different grinds in parallel. Like, I'm saying no to Scrip, Bullion, and Caps and focusing Score and I get them done in under an hour as well. Wait till its weekend and I can really focus on the XP repeat. Finally a reason to power level my guy to 300

coming very soon to xbox. I believe they are on the hunt for their very last plan which is probably the rarest plan in the game.
---
Apparently there are 1300 different plans in the game.

Wow nice. Looks like I’m grinding NW. thanks

as long as Uwe Boll isnt allowed near the writers room.....
---
Yep for me and my friend
---
There was an 'incident' involving a gold bar fight and SS power armor. They can't have nice things anymore.
---
&gt;As the other post pointed out, using the keyboard and the Tab key is paramount to efficient scrapping(RIP console players
---
For console players, after scrapping or buying ammopoints, press B (or PS equivalent) to return to the previous screen to continue with your selection. 
---
Its still tediois, but not as tedious as going through all the menus again.
---
It depends on how Bethesda sees the show. Usually the shows/movies based on games/books are adaptations, where an existing story is used and changed to fit the visual media. E.g. Game of Thrones, Witcher, Warcraft.
---
But there's the rare case of them using the media to expand the lore. For example the Assassin's Creed movie did it. It's part of the same cannon as the games. I have the feeling that Bethesda is brave enough to take the second route and give us new stories that will expand the lore, instead of just retelling it.
---
Never heard of this, I’ll keep it in mind myself. Thanks!
---
I have Todd mutation. 
---
- Bugs spawn around you and everyone except Bethesda can see them.
---
Yeah I am exactly the same. So many rewards are cosmetic and im just here trying to find gear i really like. I am not getting on the hamster wheel for crap i won't even use! 
---
Fasnacht was fun! And you get a legendary or two if you complete it. And you can do it on the hour, so a minimal and predictable time gate. Lots of social between everyone and a big boss at the end. Probably the most fun ive had since was wastelanders update.
---
Double xp is a patch because they realize they built a system that is broken for casual players.
---
Fuck the ammo converter, fix adrenaline
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who was unlocking them.
---
Single drawback (low health) versus the list of benefits that keeps growing with every new patch...
---
Specifically NW? Gonna have to grind these
---
Charges you for the end of each episode
---
Article appears to start to load, and is then overtaken by the language selection and download button for the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) client.
---
Well damn, count yourself lucky then! Doesn't seem to be working for me :(
---
They say but that tends to never be solidified.
---
Just don't set the world on fire.
---
Ahhh I was a bit off then, sorry about that. But still that is nuts
---
It's a bug and they(Bethesda) knows about it so collect them while you can
---
all bets are off in NW purge
---
&gt; It's never going to be the ONLY game I play
---
That's pretty much the crux of it for me. The game doesn't have anywhere near enough content to justify you treating it like an MMO, there has only been a few slivers of content since release.
---
Not everyone wants to play Nuclear Winter either, it wasn't advertised as a major part of the game, now it's essentially a cornerstone that they want you to play every day for the legendary run every day, or else pay for atoms...
---
Let's hope they don't decide to not bother with actors and just put up a few notes for you to read on screen every so often (-:
---
That's where I was getting them
---
Maybe have each player kill give a +.1% bonus. That way more kills gives scaling rewards depending on how long you survive as well. Ten kills doubles your xp reward and so on
---
Edit: sorry, .1% multipliers added so that 1 kill means xp x1.1 and so on
---
I hope this tells us about the rest of the world other than the USA.
---
My pirate Halloween costume disappeared a few updates ago. Not sure how or why this happens.
---
I'll stick with fan made ones. Like Nuka Break on YouTube. When it's done by fans it's done right. Hollywood gets involved and it's gonna be a shit show.
---
Party at Toxic Larry’s!
---
It's a bug, can confirm
---
My 10mm automatic likes this, it is very forgotten with only one skin
---
I’ve been playing for about two hours now on console ( not Bush camping) and it’s fun . Definitely a break from the grind of events in adventure mode
---
Ah nuka-break good little taste of fallout.. Production was pretty good and the props and make up looked pretty good. Practical effects made it easy eough to do but it's still a fan-made series. Not a bad one though
---
Yup, I started the character after Wastelanders, so it's definitely post-Wastelanders. The issue just started with patch 20.
---
Slim (Nuka Break) better be cast!
---
Ahhh that's unfortunate
---
I've played for the last two nights and I've already claimed the wood ghillie armor skin. I'm a super casual player too so those SCORE points do stack up.
---
I really really hope they keep the music. Without it, it isn't Fallout. 
---
Well, if Bethesda can license the music from Inkstpots then Amazing has enough cash to do the same.
---
Unfortunately I'm on Xbox or I would give you some materials, but you said you had a base built?
---
If you already did this I hope someone can give you some, but you might already have some stuff built -
---
When you moved your camp, if it gave you a blueprint for the full base (that you didn't create) scrap the blueprint and you'll get your base parts back, walls and such, they'll be in your stored tab
---
Here’s hoping they don’t mess it up
---
I find this especially interesting after the whole app development fiasco with Westworld game app using a developer that supposedly stole code from Fallout Shelter and lots of the back and forth over stolen content ideas with how similar their hosts vs synths looked on screen. Looks like a win win rather than pay for a loss of intellectual property, just option the rights and develop a series out of it so you don't have to debate who has the right to do what.
---
I mean, so far it feels sporadic in general. Some things work fine, others seem to not, and some I get notified an hour later that I did the challenge; it's a bit of a mess
---
Makes sense it'll be on Amazon. After spending money on prime you'll still need to pay 2.99 per episode! 😂
---
adrenaline doesnt work
---
I will papi :*
---
The only problem with the ammo converter is the UI other than that keep it that same, it's only a mundane task because everyone just got it and has been saving up thousands of rounds of unused ammo, once you get through that it will only take a few minutes whenever you stop back at camp.
---
To add onto this, that blueprint should be in your stored tab.
---
No amount of education is going to replace the basic definition of objectivity. And I will never understand a person who thinks they can define concepts like 'fun' without using bias (and therefore making a subjective statement).
---
Me too!
---
My two-shot, explosive gatling gun deserves that amazing skin!
---
Ahhh the Final Word...good gun
---
When you do link it to twitch, you'll get twitch prime for free, and then you can get twitch prime loot if you link that to your game accounts
---
You can still grind experience. Cause hey, who really wants to explore the map and other players' camps or any other activity that other stuff that doesn't result in the super satisfying validation of experience points anyway. You're not really playing the game unless you're collecting those perk cards, gold, script, caps, legendaries, masks, and purified water. That's the ticket.
---
the average player wont get 50k xp per day I get 10 to 20k per day maybe.
---
it's all about Daily Active Users
---
That shouldn't be required either. A double score weekend should be a bonus event to make the grind end quicker, not an essential event that must be completed or you miss out.
---
i know! it kills me a little inside that i wasn't around to buy the Fridge. i'd never use it, but darned if my kitchen doesn't look weird with a Nuka cola machine where a fridge should live.
---
Until we run out of lunchboxes... then they put them on the atom shop.
---
speaking of.....i have something a little different for you this time.  There's a settlement that needs our help.
---
To be honest, if anyone could do it justice I think they're a great fit especially since everyone has made comments about similarities between how they made Westworld look and Fallout already.
---
dont most people run broken armor?
---
It's pretty easy to get through the ranks thanks to all the xp boosts we can get.
---
Scorched earth farming:
---
Full bond event team
---
Canned meatstew
---
Inspirational (all members maxed I'm not sure)
---
Lunchboxes
---
Whatever the xp bobble head is
---
Pour a cup of water into the console.  Boom.
---
my only complaint is how long it is going to take to convert the thousands of .38 ammo I've stockpiled
---
Also, switch to *Building* in between Events for another XP Boost!
---
ROFL
---
Well yea but thats a glitch
---
I was on today and watched the reset. All my challenges popped just fine.
---
It's amazing how many people didn't know this. Pretty sure it's been the same since Fallout 3.
---
Yea i stored the base and from parts of the old base i started building another one and i'm missing materials
---
It's not a bug, they did it on purpose.
---
If the space park camp item is big enough I'm going to live in it
---
Sweet!
---
Yeah doesn’t take any caps when you travel there. Just visual.
---
combine capturing the workshops and building for even more
---
Thanks man. I am. 
---
And likewise
---
&gt; make sure to claim it so you have it when we do!
---
Yep better claim it while you can because the season will probably be over by the time they do anything about it.
---
i hope the fallout 2 talking heads make pipboy cameos
---
I found one in the forest southwest of the fissure site prime in the forest. Scared me as I didn't have much ammo or healing items after sbq, and I was solo playing, and I even managed to get myself stuck on the sofa and wall in the ruined house ;-( in total took me about 15-20 mins to kill when factoring in walking back over to the forest after pulse nading myself to get unstuck
---
I Get down with the different perspective. 2 tiers in the future would be nice
---
I don't know how they thought the Gauss Pistol damage was too high. It wasn't amazing to begin with. But now it is taking 2 headshots in vats to take down a lvl 14 super mutant using a Lvl 50 Gauss Pistol. That's not a fix that is a break. 
---
BTW I have gunslinger maxed. Expert and Master Gunslinger with 1 point in each. Bloody Mess at max. 1 point in Tenderizer and Concentrated fire maxed. 
---
I don't expect to be melting a Scorch Queen with the pistol but any non-legendary below lvl 50 should be VERY easy pickings.
---
Half the job of working at Bethesda is apologizing for bugs.
---
Yeah that’s a solid idea too
---
Alright :) just wanted to make sure, a lot of people don't realize the blueprint will return their camp objects
---
I still wish we had gotten cross platform support lol
---
Hope you find what you need :)
---
That’s a very Bethesda thing to do
---
Different location from the deep?
---
Anyone know if legendary modules are included in the purveyors 25% off sale?
---
I got my presents from Zax. That’s the important thing. But if I could somehow get that glow in the dark Sans costume...
---
I'm curious...? But really...? I'd really prefer they focused on adding content to their video game... not tv.
---
I would just like the game to acknowledge the fact that I HAVE discovered Abandoned Bog Town and Beckley.
---
new team system 100% recommend thanks devs makes playing quests and events and killing high lvl mobs worth it for u and 3 others
---
I read about that. But Adrenaline doesn't take effect until after you killed a creature and move on to the next. What I'm talking about is my initial damage against a target that has decreased to a point that I think is broken.
---
Was digging for this info last night, thanks!!!
---
Let me know the next time you are online.  I want to run the list again please.
---
When using vats the gauss pistol was applying charge damage without having to charge the weapon.
---
My quad gauss was doing the same damage whether i charged it or just shot it regularly in vats pre patch 20. Have not tested since 20 came out.
---
No, it is called the deep. Sorry missed that part. I'm saying as you read into the terminal their are 5 more tunnels. 4 have locations and the 5th has no location. I was wondering if the tunnels on this terminal are actual places in the map.
---
Sure thing. I am offline until tomorrow so maybe you could just message me then so I remember
---
Now, if they make the lunchboxes something that drops from the new Collossus event as well as purchaseable, I won’t care.  Since I’ll just be farming them in game.  But if they are purely something you buy...
---
You can do them at any level.
---
If I remember tomorrow I will add you and drop some stuff off
---
Interesting point pal but think of it this way. The more people they get involved with fallout the more money they will have to develop future games, including the money they will make from this show.
---
I'm fairly sure you can do them as soon as you leave the vault but they don't start showing up on the map to fast travel to into around level 7.
---
I got you 
---
Look for a req
---
Less than 2 hours a day is all it takes, that's pretty much the casual player right there. How much time do you think it should take? I've got a full time job too, I can spend 2 hours on fallout and watch tv shows the rest of the night.
---
That's a good point actually! Setup some Workshops with decent defences that should hopefully complete the Retake Event themselves. Time to utilise the Scarecrow. Genuis.
---
The deep has to do with the settler questline
---
Awesome. My psn is leCRUIZE if you want to add
---
Oh ok. Nice, thx
---
100 S.C.O.R.E shy of rank 12, and still got to do the 10 legendaries weekly seems tricky to do for low levels as I'm barely seeing any.
---
But I refuse to do the NW ones as I will not be roped in to playing a BR game. 
---
Also what weekend is double xp/score going to be ? As I click the link and it doesnt show me any info just asks me to download Bethesda net.
---
They just need an option to toggle all ammo types they want to have convert to points, so when you walk up to it you just convert all, and then let it redeem all your point into 1 type of ammo.
---
It’s like having your main damage cards doubled. My slugger perks do 60%, add another 60% to that and it’s amazing.
---
Are you in a situation where you're in need of ammo? If you're higher than level 40 there are much simpler ways to obtain ammo. No need to convert ammo if you can just craft it.  Drop you your unused ammo to low level players.
---
This. 
---
Rocking over 35 intell now with PA on 😁👍
---
Ya I agree fully
---
The return on it's not worth the time, unless ur mainly returning missiles, mini nukes, and syringer ammo. It's best to just put the ammo you dont use into your shop and hoop around looking for what you want. Yea the interface is trash but the return is worse
---
Great job in detailing the issue. Nothing quite gets things fixed like a whole bunch of vagueness.
---
Nice bit of research there.  And it seems to be inline with other gold scrap sources.  I mean, you get a gold scrap for the leaf on a gold rimmed glass.  One unit of scrap must be miniscule.
---
the simplest thing, that would make a world of difference, is to just go back to the same screen you were on, after converting some ammo, instead of back to the very beginning.   
---
obviously, there are many, better ways to fix this, but just that would be a huge help.
---
silly to u, maybe! but everyone is different and has diferent rationale for their thinking. and yea, mb this will be the case. i think if it is ill stay- thank to 1st i get a healthy stream of atoms as it is and yea as state on another reply i rlly do enjoy 76! that being said tho i also did rlly rlly enjoy destiny. either way im fine, delete it or not. i just like to know is all~
---
Ah, that makes sence.
---
Man who downvoted you, this comment was funny!
---
I'm very excited about a Fallout show this is going to be great! I'm also confident since Amazon is developing the series. They don't produce as many shows as Netflix but seem to have a focus on quality.
---
Me too. It's necessary to make a ticket about that or they now the people that's being affected?
---
Yesterday 4 challenges auto complete so I'm way behind on score points now. :(
---
Damn good writing. Love the TM logo.
---
Works like a charm, you don't even loose your Bonds. Another player mentioned Workshops. This is also a good idea, set them up so defences can take care of the Retake Events. Scarecrow will be handy. I'm gonna try this tonight. I'll prob set them up in stealth before activating a Team though. HeHe.
---
Right, we need sliders for crafting vs. spamming enter and lagging the client (&amp; server) with 100s of requests. I'd assume they don't do it that way so there is a confirm/verify components every time, but don't most exploits use some kind of menu spamming to force dupes?
---
Bethesda- give us ways to craft multiples or craft all w/ avail components. Even your gacha mobile games do that correctly.
---
I hear ya. Low levels is tough. Jump in events that guarantee them that you can actually tag such as free range in forest and savage divide, and uranium fever.
---
Also you can get legendary low lvl enemies if you force the spawns at places like whitesprings but ur best bet other than events is likely scorchbeasts at fissure with a high lvl buddy. Of you have no friends public teams helps. Just need to tag them. Getting to lvl 30+ you can do your own runs in places like Charleston capital which is instances and therefore certainly going to have enemies for you
---
You're only allowed to watch 20% of an episode per day. /s
---
... I'm only level 30. Still wondering how am I supposed to get more than 10k exp a day playing without grinding things.
---
I was enjoying the game leisurely, lots of exploring and building before this update. Now? I don't even have time to build stuffs...
---
Sheeeeet. Gonna have to check this. My poor BE collection
---
Queen didn’t land, we managed to kill the queen, still failed the event. Happy Now?
---
Apparently this post has been removed because it’s not about Fallout 76.
---
I'm still confused about the Colossus. As a mainly lone player, the scorchbeast queen is an easy MobBoss to coordinate for, someone drops a nuke, a bunch of random players congregate and attack the boss.   
---
The Colossus on the other hand is a random spawn and I have no way of attracting the attention of other players.... unless i'm missing something besides the obvious "form a team"
---
Surely it has to be? You would like to think so anyway lol
---
Aside from cosmetics and the ammo converter... is there anything in this new grind game worth grinding for? By that I mean, a weapon or armor or something different with actual rules rather than just a skin?
---
Weeks you say??
---
Thanks for the info, I just hit 30 today and am seeing some improvement as far as not struggling for meds and such anymore so fingers crossed I get few more legendaries to spawn as I'm on 4/10 now.
---
I got you, chief.
---
GT: rammadeus
---
join me. Camp is near top of the world
---
Hahaha clipping through walls and crashing right before the end of a dungeon imminent
---
Thats what I said.
---
Because the suit is an outfit and outfits are worn over armor
---
Are we sure there are still daily level up challenges that require outfits? I was going to dump all of mine back in Stash since last 2 days haven't (though I haven't seen todays yet).
---
You can't get the Unyielding bonus +15 INT  (~+30% XP), which is vital for completing the 10k XP challenge and for leveling up.
---
Glad to see it's still active
---
If they plan it out for a miniseries of just one season I'd imagine it might finally tell the story of vaulttec and how the war happened but I don't know, could just jump right into the wasteland. 
---
Not sure if they'll tell a brand new story based on the world or an adaptation of any of the original stories
---
How do people get those things next to their names like responders and order of mysteries and raiders ps4 and brotherhood
---
How I make my complain or refund? Yesterday 4 of them autocomplet for me :\\\
---
Oh ! Thanks ! i come
---
Highly recommend uranium fever if you see it. Guaranteed 3 legendary. It up quite a bit.
---
Yep, depressing isn't it?
---
Personally, I was expecting daily limits on ammo conversion, so the crappy interface is a massive improvement on my expectations, and the news that they're planning on improving it genuinely shocked me.
---
I'm still not getting my hopes up though.
---
Instead of Nuking his base probably would've been better to educate them and let them know people were waiting. I know when I was level 19 I just saw an objective prompt, walked to it, and did it. Simply due to that was always how you play Fallout
---
the tall building near Abandoned Bog Workshop has a solid amount of globes and typewriters. 
---
Wendigos are good for screws as well.
---
Class! What's the PA Mod that gives INT called again?
---
Can you add/is there an option I'm missing to start from a score level?
---
Sensor array+2 I think 😁
---
Don't forget about canned meat stew and lunchboxes
---
Thank you for using my poster design for the Free States 💕
---
Double XP (ie more score) and Double Score weekends being announced was also good news!
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates
---
Thanks, I'll check that!
---
Nice bud! Cheers.
---
So basically all ammo would be interchange. Why not just have ammo points instead of ammo. Hardly a survival game aspect IMO.
---
It came out this April so literally or are you speaking figuratively.  
---
Youre entitled to your opinion and so are others. Its a good thing you like it but not everyone agrees.
---
Thanks. I've been asking people who post to see if I can figure out what to avoid doing. Most people have said they were either online at the time or they last logged out of NW.
---
While were at it, can we have that slider on cooking food/crafting as well?
---
I used to see more people there than scorched earth. Its also a ridiculously easy event to solo
---
Typewriters and desk fans will be what your looking for also super mutants usually have loose screws
---
Plus a daily challenge every day that requires at least 1 event participation has definitely motivated people imo
---
How close do you need to remain to your team for the exp bonuses?
---
Totally agree. Typical Bethesda mix of full greed and incompetence or never know when to stop.
---
And i would keep in mind how those utility items startet in the first place: Repair Kits, very gentle, improved version only optainable ingame so no one can complain. It is always a slippery slope. Ammo converter as level 5, ok thats optainable. I bet in the next season the real killer reward lies at level 100. And if you want it you will have to pay! With your time or your wallet, but offcourse Bethesda would prefer if you just handover the 140 USD for the item...
---
I’ve had this issue multiple times, it almost gets frustrating. I’m trying to drop a care package for some low level player and they keep running away from me lol, I guess seeing some level 150 following you around when you’re an hour into the game would be unsettling haha
---
Long press on exit ( the O on PS4)
---
Thus is the price of *not living free...*
---
I wouldn't even care about the small increments of it weren't for the fact that every time you select something it kicks you back to the menu, of it weren't for that you could at least spam the button.
---
I have heard people do this. Seems like a lot of work to keep track of but makes sense.
---
We have now rebuilding atles for anticipation of BoS arrival
---
I prefer stacking int with "building". On a 4 man group i have 44 int. Add the normal xp buffs and you are 24/7 on double xp weekend. And not restricted to doing only events. You gain the same xp bonus for every activity you do. But sure, if you want to just do events then event group is the way to go. Also, i use two accounts so i'm always in a group, if people join me or not. And using two accounts i can micromanage my perks/mutations etc.
---
I believe he’s joking.  It’s been a known and failed to fix bugs for a year?  Common consensus is it has to do with regen effects but that’s not 100% of it
---
Everyone always needs ammo and dropping 1000 rounds of ammo to a low level just puts them in the same situation. Shouldn't the ammo converter be the simplest/quickest way to get ammo that's The gripe, is the tediousness of the converter not the converter itself.
---
Im at home now, wanna do the trade?
---
I would pay \~500 atoms to have Bloody Mess not explode bodies. Sometimes it can be hard finding your loot!
---
Yea doing uranium fever now doesn't seem a stretch to switch at the 30 sec mark.
---
I got to play a bit yesterday and with the new public team system, I was able to level up like five times, even at being over level 350.  I was concerned too, but if you play, you'll see it's a non-issue.  And the high rate of XP with all the bonuses means you'll collect extra SCORE from the repeatable XP challenge.
---
I can't even remember when it started doing this crap for me but it was at least 6 months ago, probably even longer than that.  
---
Kind of envious if you've only had to deal with it for weeks.
---
Noticed it right after the update your not alone also on Xbox my wife and I had the same issue
---
Lmao non-issue. OP gets to save perk cards and weight! Please share how this happened... I would like to troubleshoot aswell.
---
Ah, well that's a true bummer then.
---
Yeah, juice head did it to. It only gives you  about 215 000 score instead of the 220 000 (please correct if numbers are a bit of). And thats only if you do every fucking daily and weekly challenge....
---
It's for the greater good of course
---
not gonna lie this stuff kinda pisses me off, want to max raiders? = exploit Rocksy! want to craft t65 and ss armor? = buy plans on one character and drop them for another!
---
heres me still grindin the raiders to get my ammo crafter, got like 2 pieces of SS. not even gonna mention the t65.
---
Ok glad you got the ammo game down but there are loads of higher levels still struggling with ammo, especially solo players who don't have time/don't want to watch tutorials and only know what they've figured out on their own.
---
SBQ won’t land if you’re shooting her with heavy weapons or anything that will cause a stagger effect. It’s a big reason why SQB farmers generally stick to melee builds when fighting her. And the rest of the team of heavies take out the hordes that appear.
---
Anglers count too
---
I am so grateful Bethesda acknowledged a problem that was so monstrously huge they couldn't possibly ignore it.  They really are doing us a huge favor by  pledging to fix a broken mechanic that should never have been in the game to begin with and that they never bothered to test.   We should all be eternally grateful.
---
Also on XB1 and having the same issues since the update
---
You can turn those off under setting in display
---
Ward is his own man. There is no fixing him.
---
Some things to help the queen land. Quit shooting her in the air. Don’t stand on V9. Don’t put tents all around V9 where she has no place to land. And finally, quit shooting her in the air. 
---
You only need to do like 2-3k damage to her to get credit for the kill
---
They used to give Ore but they changed it.
---
🤞time will tell🤞 I really hope they knock it out of the park in the next game. Even if 76 ends up being a "throw away" game just to test ideas for the next big release I'd be ok with that.
---
Why are people here so resilient in not accepting facts? This has been proven publicly and posted here multiple times. Taking some berry mentats before finishing an event or turning in a quest has very noticeable exp bonuses
---
Jericho?
---
Not the Terminals, please!  
---
I got flashbacks of the new press machine.
---
Minimum viable product
---
That's why
---
Enclave bunker has several fans in one of the rooms. 
---
Vendor bots occasionally sell bulk screws. 
---
Player vendors sometimes sell screws, too
---
Wastelanders Came out this April. No idea why it's considered a new game. The game was originally released November 14th 2018. So a year was Nov 14th 2019. Two years will be in a few months.
---
Oh, wow, people have opinions other than my own? Who woulda thunk it? In that case I'm wrong for sharing mine? Since, you felt the need to state that.
---
Accessible via the roof!
---
"You will finish in 69 days." 
---
And don’t forget about  The ArmCo ammunition construction feedback, add some new ammo type 10mm , 2mm , fusion core ..etc
---
A+   I generally just do firestation and green county lodge with a few server hops, but this is great.  Once you have ammosmith, super duper, and this information your ammo problems are over.
---
(first one being july 23 - july 27) 
---
If it even matters as roadmap only says double dailies. Nothing more. But yea, doesn't to save them just in case.
---
I think when it spawns it also starts an event? A Colossal Problem or something like it. So everybody will know he's there, just like with the Sheepsquatch.
---
Not super rare. Complete project paradise and the plan will eventually drop.  Doesn't require all 3 friendlies to survive iirc.
---
If all you need is a few of the actual chem instead of the recipe I'm sure you can buy some for a few caps in the trading sub.
---
Yes, you'll be able to purchase his items as usual.
---
Not very.  Have about 2 spare plans in my stash and have sold several more through my vendor in the past few months.
---
Completely overlooked it on the Cal! 😬
---
I’m “that guy” now. 🥴
---
Its under resources I think.
---
Any tips on how to keep my ammo topped up, I'm using a combat rifle and 10mm sub right now and tearing through ammo, crafting my own when possible and grabbing every bit of acid I see along with doing lead runs here and there but still find myself running low.

 &gt; Yes, you'll be able to purchase his items as usual.
---
100% agree.
---
Thank you, very nice!
---
I am glad you are real as well
---
Thanks! I figured there was, but I hadn't had a chance to explore everything yet.
---
Mark the calendar and don’t touch those weekly challenges. Prolly more of a challenge to not complete them if you play everyday.
---
If you have a PC character you can continue to play that PC character, but xbox characters will not transfer to PC.

Sugar Grove has a large number of desk fans and clipboards.

---
Overall, very well laid out!  Mine is very similar. 
---
I suggested adding in Pleasant Valley. The cans and the weights will net you about 90+ lead and there is very minimal enemy resistance.
---
Man, I think you need a break from the game if you think the devs are actually this malicious.
---
That's nice. On one hand it may seem that they are responding 2 days too late, but we have to acknowledge that they had to make some internal meetings about this. They cannot outright promise a rework and then find out it's not feasible...
---
Scroll down

Grafton Monster is at Charleston in the Riverbed between the trainyard and poseidon powerplant. reliable spawnpoint usually. There is also one or even two on the wasteplane south of hemlock holes. theres grafton day of course. and theres a grafton monster when you FT to charlston capitol, below in the floodbed.
---
I stopped playing. The load times and bugs and glitches and shit just not working took its toll. Love the game but it’s unplayable at times
---
Seriously though how did this even get to live? Did an intern make it? Did anyone even test it???
---
The police department nearby has handcuffs as well.
---
I've only received score for completing scorched earth/ encryptid 2 or 3 times and I've done at least 10 in the past 2 days..
---
How much time left on the clock when she was killed?
---
Oh I've scared new players before, even with a mic, LOL! It's funny when I drop a bunch of stuff, in a gift box none the less, and using the give gift emoji, and they either just stand there, run, or fast travel, LOL!
---
I chased this one player around for I think 3 fast travels. The last one I followed, (Before giving up) his father got on the mic and asked me why I was bothering his son? After explaining what I was trying to do, and that I was a father as well and understood his concern, as well as making sure I appreciated his son's game play was being monitored, I gave him a HUGE amount of plans and other goodies. He just hit level 20, so I made him a The Fixer, and 2k ammo. He was over the moon! Then me and my team helped him build an awesome C.A.M.P.
---
I just shared my very few bad experiences, to show why trying stuff like this on a public server just doesn't work. I also leaned that new players aren't really aware of vending machines, and eve the ones that do, figure they don't have many caps, and can't afford anything anyway. 98% of my dealings with players are very positive, I'll not allow the 2% ruin it for everyone. Instead, I just change how I'm kind to others on the game.
---
Most likely got them at 3/5 instead of 5/5,
---
If those are the challenges you’re referring too. 
---
They seem to be bugged.
---
I never expected that and there was no reason to.  If you attempted to drop the helmet, the notice said that it would be destroyed and you could craft a new one. It didn't say anything about needing a helmet to craft a helmet.
---
Also **Anglers count as Cryptids**, visit the **Gnarled Shadows (uppermost Northeast part of the map)**, get this challenge done in less than a minute!
---
Huh i must have missed that when i bumped into him
---
the greaaater gooood
---
What are all the prizes?
---
I’m pretty sure heavy weapons don’t inherently have a stagger effect.
---
3* is what I run it at.. and also use gun-fu @ 2*
---
I bought an external SSD and transferred the game over - load times are much much better now. They almost cause me to quit as well. Bugs and glitches I don’t run into that often.. aside from performance issues.
---
i use both..
---
Small backpack is available to everyone. You just have to get the plan from the overseer cache at the airport. Not as much of a benefit as a standard, but with alts you may not notice the difference as much
---
(a terrible, dad joke filled sitcom based in the "closed" years of the vault)...
---
(unjustified fear of this made the fasnacht music play in my head)
---
Not everyone can afford to grind for 4-6 hours a day for dailys or weeklies on top of the already existing dailys for scrip/gold. That's where the issue is. 
---
Its great that it feels casual to you.  However your casual might be someone else's hardcore.
---
especially on how hard it got bashed and seeing other titles that came out in similar states yet they haven't had any content updates after a few weeks after launch. ~~*cough cough anthem cough cough*~~
---
I am so glad that the devs didn't give up on the game
---
It has always been awful. 30 FPS
---
I was trying to explain this to someone yesterday, you explained it much better lol. It’s not as time consuming as people make it out to be if you use this method. Also once you get rid of your bulk ammo it’s pretty quick to hit the converter every couple hours of gameplay, I actually really like mine:) thank you for this breakdown you’re awesome
---
I'm honestly amazed this passed QA in the first place.
---
If you wish to contact us about franchising opportunity just send a private message to work out the details.
---
Yeah, you really need to level up some. I didn't leave the forest till I was at lvl 25 then went straight to the Ash Heap to get the Excavator PA, and even then didn't start helping Rose till I was lvl 30.
---
I haven't even touched the Wastelanders stuff yet and I'm currently at 35. That's next tho. Now that I have Rose's transmitter up and running, Ill go talk to the Overseer and get the vaccination thing going.
---
I rarely die now that I have done it this way. I have a couple of decent weapons and some decent protection so I feel more comfortable taking on higher enemies.
---
Yesterday that happened to me as well. Today I followed the advice of a fellow player and didn't log in until about 20 minutes after reset (and wasn't online 20 minutes before reset as well). Apparently this prevents the bug from happening. Sucks a lot, but while we wait for the issue to be fixed, I will be doing this.
---
I was up on a cliff with a lead deposit for a while. Every log in gave me some snallies to warm up on.
---
They don't stand up to power fists and gauntlets, either.
---
Same, it's taken me about 3 months to go from level 300 to level 343...
---
So according to this a high-level player who devotes exactly one level up's worth of gameplay _and_ finishes all the non-NW challenges in exactly 7 days will complete the Legendary Run in the nick of time. 
---
To put things into perspective, I leveled up 3 times on day 1, leveled up twice on day 2. First day I was laser-focused on completing as many challenges and events as possible, second day I joined a building team for the INT boost and just farmed super mutants at a relaxed pace but with massive XP and INT boosts from Tasty Squirrel Stew + Scorchbeast Brains + Berry Mentats + Egghead + Carnivore + Strange in Numbers.
---
yes, it's really nerfed. Damage and explosive damage down, but the frustrating "shakey stuck" bugs of the gun remain.... a bow and arrow is almost more viable than the gauss pistol atm
---
Somewhat related question. Is the arktos backpack a reward also? Or was that an atomic shop item?
---
I'm a level 400, and scare the crap out of new players, LOL! The only problem I have sometimes is, if its kids, they get so excited, then start following me around, LOL!
---
I really don't want to be rude, because I totally get kids, raising a daughter, I understand how it works. So to keep them from getting upset, right after I drop them a bunch of stuff, (If a kid gets on the mic) I'll switch servers.
---
This is what Bethesda responds to. Good look 👍
---
It was all part of the plan hahaha
---
My suspicion is it was designed as an atom shop item (i.e. more of a flare or a toy than something supremely useful) that can't be that game changing so as to not be pay to win, but then they added it to this legendary run and everyone saw it and was way more excited about it than they anticipated and it disappointed everyone.
---
The teamup mechanic is the only part of the Seasons that everyone seems to like, even loners like me.
---
you need to use a tv/monitor with xbox
---
The best thing they could adapt if done properly is the story of Cesar and Joshua graham and how the burned mad was created
---
They can't die at exactly the same spots though, can they? Like literally 0mm difference :o Looks more like spawns, especially since there can be multiple items laying on top of each other. Thiefs usually walk around and die near the spot but not on it
---
The dailies aren’t that difficult to achieve, and the weeklies aren’t meant to be done all at once, you should be able to progress with only a few hours of game play a day, I wasn’t even on for 2 hours and finished today’s challenges
---
full unyielding + building team + cranberry relish w/ herbivore = mighty gains
---
Crazy bad
---
We are definitely not talking about cosmetic stuff alone, you are though. People ask almost weekly for a storage increase, but Bethesda refuses too. Why? Because they know the limited storage puts players between a rock and a hard place; where players may find themselves more inclined to spend the $13 for the junk storage. 
---
This may not seem like an issue, but it's a pretty frequent practice seen in a lot of Eastern MMOs with predatory microtransactions. They inconvenience the player or add systems to inconvenience the player, then try to sell a solution. The catch22 is the inconvenience is always created by the game and can easily be solved.
---
I didn't mean you, bud.  Lol.
---
Just the interface alone would be exciting.
---
Roadmap reads "double dailies" not "double score". Meaning don't get too excited yet..
---
4 seconds to spare.
---
they could offer a device that fast-travels/teleports you to grahm... call it a tele-grahm...
---
(Angry boos and fasnacht music)
---
Ooo man yes those do. If you are commando lownlvl it's a bitch. Best do sneak crits and head shots in vats to conserve as much as possible. Then for tough guys let it rip. Getting more ammo there is the new ammo converter but it's tedious ( see reddit rage walls)
---
Other than that craft, and take the ammo Smith and super duper perks asap. Steel is easy, with scrapped perk on int INT scrap all human like enemies weapons. Make sure you use scrapper it triples if not quadruple the output of steel... Lead, tag it. Collect all tin cans, include can chime traps. Collect weight in prison eastern regional and weights in vault Tec University. Also lead in Charleston fire department. Higher lvls you get lead from lucky hole mine south of fort defiance in cranberry bog. Gunpowder is the third and final ingredients. Kill super mutants or craft it with acid and all that cloth you get. Acid and lead are the rarer ones. If you on PS4 add me I'll hook you up.
---
Last but not least. Only craft the BEST ammo. 45 or 556. 10mm is nice but not worth the materials to get more. You want to make ur ammo last
---
Oh man,  I thought I had to kill the imposter sheepsquatch three times at first...
---
I was thinking wow that"s actually a challenge, probably a bunch of people will be very unhappy
---
What do you mean by grinding burrows
---
might be true. i mean, i played LOTRO and STO for a long time, and those ARE grinders from the deepest holes of hell to me. the FO76 play is much more relaxed i´d say...
---
Are you overencumbered?  Even if it’s inaccurate, what do your weight numbers say?
---
Apparently I need at least 40k EXP a day, every challenge (No NW) and I will make the journey on exactly the last day, Jesus Christ...
---
My wife has lost the gift emote
---
I built a trailer and trash filled lawn by the truck. Go left if facing town and there are some copper veins.
---
THIS!
---
What's the common problem with Vats? Its was broken before Fasnatch and yall fixed it with the re opening of player vendors, not 3 days after it's fixed it yet again no longer works. Its non existant in PvP, a d in PvE it misses 8 out of 10 shots with 95% hit chance. Worse yet it when you reload and go back into vats and a full magazine in vats does 0 to a target point blank but hip firing kills them. A d the weapons having to reload with 5,7,15,24 rounds still in the magazine is getting old. A bloodied fixer that holds 25 rounds and I am forced to reload with 15 rounds remaining is a sure way to be discovered a d killed in my sneak build
---
Handmade rifle is a great choice
---
I'm extremely under my max carry weight
---
You mean the fact that you can Free Fast Travel to his Public Event when it begins?  ;)
---
Yea but 4 days usually more of just dailies is a good start. Even if it's double the challenges I'm happy
---
It is supposed to although my friend has told me it isn’t working in his camp current / not producing power
---
The answer is yes, there's a couple of reasons it looks like based off recent script changes but it definitely is worse is highly populated areas.
---
Awesome, I'll give that a look if I ever come across one, thanks!
---
All glory to Atom!
---
I wish I could take part in this too but I am on Xbox and level 206 I think. But oh well still happy to be playing and loving the game!
---
are you in 3rd person? you may have the ADS bug.  if thats the case go to 1st person, hit ads button, then go back to 3rd person
---
cobbler and stew don't stack. In fact all the +XP meals don't stack. Already tried it. 
---
Better setup: 
---
- berry mentats
---
- egghead
---
- strange in numbers
---
- Inspirational 3
---
Then, If Carnivore:
---
- squirrel stew
---
- SB brains
---
If Herbivore:
---
- Cranberry Relish
---
- Brain Fungus Soup
---
Join a Building Team for another +4 INT or an Event Team and do all the faction events, and you should see extreme results, like double XP weekend results.
---
Honestly when I first heard about the converter, i assumed it would act like the scrip machines you find at stations. I now cant help but think that this was designed to be intentionally bad. Because let's be honest, there are already existing mechanics in the game that can do it better than the computer UI they've used. Even if I was just starting I don't think I would even bother to use it.
---
Absolutely
---
He might still have the misc structure up. You have to replace it with the one under generators.
---
&gt;cough cough anthem cough cough
---
Does anyone play Anthem still? Was day 1 there too, what a shitshow that game was. F76 may have been buggier, but it had far more content at release.
---
Ditto @ 12, maybe hit 14 ish with the dailies from today.
---
Ive done all the challenges including NW.
---
Nah he just rebuilt his camp last night
---
They've already burned me out with the stupid gold bullion grind.
---
Try un-equipping your gear and perks, then log out completely. 
---
Log back in and re-equip everything. 
---
No because you need to be with the team long enough as all 4 to be fully bonded. 
---
You can do it, but it's more coordination than just last few seconds swap.
---
They took out the clothing requirement, so yeah, you can throw everything back in the stash.
---
I was not, but tested that, and it didn't help. That seemed like the most reasonable solution.
---
Hit the walk key, forward slash on pc
---
if you're already specced for shotgun you could get the rep with foundation and get the gauss shotgun. It murders everything. 
---
Or try and get a quad shotgun.
---
I gritted my teeth and put up with the interface to turn in all my spare ammo- the deal breaker for me was seeing just how little .44 ammo I'd be able to claim for all that time...
---
Still seems easier to spend a few caps buying it for 1cap per from someone's vending machine and dumping my unused ammo...
---
PC. I will report status after testing.
---
judging solely by the text on the card.. im gonna say.. if it does work.. its broken..
---
I will say, good luck on finding one. They used to be really hard in certain areas but I think they’re a lot easier to find
---
u/valseek and u/LadyDevann do the devs know about this one?
---
They want you to log in daily and check out the atom shop. Every single mechanic of the game is designed around pushing the shop.
---
Try disabling any mods (if you have any) if the problem persists.
---
had 2 drop in a row. just sold them for about for roughly 4.5-5k
---
Public teams are just teams that earn benefits and take away camp related permissions. Its still a team.
---
Huh. Worked. Guess I'm a dumbass.
---
start hunting gulpers and milking brahmin, and include pepper farming runs in your routine. Pepperoni Rolls give +60 carry weight to carnivores now, and if you have strange in numbers that goes up to +75.
---
This is very helpful. So basically miss one day or be a casual player you won't finish the board haha. I did a little math on my own for the repeatable, I'm not sure if ita different for others, what I'm getting is 66 per kill and 250-600 points per event finished. I did this without joining the bonus event group x3 because I want to get the base points. I'm going to do the Scorched queen base and x3 points later.
---
Sounds like I'm doing most of that correctly already thank you for taking the time to teach me a thing or two, and reassure what I am doing is the right thing.
---
I'll stop crafting 10mm and focus on what is best and will be farming uriniam fever and Charleston tomorrow to get them legendaries done.
---
I would love to add you but sadly I am on Xbox maybe one day will see cross platform haha.
---
But *Strange in Numbers* perk and *Empath / Herd Mentality* mutations say "hello!". Combined with *Class Freak* perk ofc.
---
Craft a low lvl suit. Won't have 0 dr but less than 140.
---
Ive done the same thing you have, so i knew the problem 😂
---
Yeah probably this, I've had a lot of friends not know the walk button existed and think they were bugged because of that key.
---
Already solved. Apparently I did not know that walk speed was affected by / key
---
That’s a great idea thank you!
---
[It's still on their site](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons) on the Seasons information page.
---
Oh, so you can use that Squirrel 10% xp recipe if you're carnivorous? Off to hunt me some squirrels :)
---
Did you hear about the Fallout TV series? The makers of West World are doing it!
---
Lmao. Thanks man. It was starting to piss me off.
---
It's pretty bad right now. Work benches, menus, and of course the queen all got slower.
---
The QA team needs to be reworked....
---
"Stunning, brave, bold, innovative, etc." - 😆  
---
What a 'reward'.
---
That's awesome! Where did you hear that?
---
How do you make Private teams?
---
If you run directly west of the crashed plane in the mire there's a sloth. It gives 7+ screws when killed. 
---
Kill. Server hop. Rinse. Repeat.
---
If you have fallout 1st tent you can put it right near it
---
Does it show doubled? My pipboy isn't showing anything doubled.
---
You could just farm it.  But then again that time spent farming could be time earning xp.
---
It's not a huge pay2win advantage at all.  But it's certainly not just a cosmetic item.
---
Either way, it's useful to know I shouldn't scrap it! 😂
---
Yeah that would annoy me too
---
If you go with Angry Turtle's INT-based setup you gain 10K XP just giving Huntersville one pass, and about 20K completing West Tek inside and outside. 
---
Stick to a Super Mutant farming loop and you should hit 50K in under an hour.
---
I've played for 4 hours over two days, I might play one more day this week, I'm level 9 or 10 in the run already.
---
I think everyone's jumping the gun on complaining.
---
I've really been putting off wastelanders quests - I guess I should get moving! Thank you :)
---
On console, if you hold the 'back' button down, you exit the terminal immediately. This is B on XB1.
---
Well what do you play it on?
---
What I do is set up a bunch of water purifiers, collect the water, sell it for caps, and then buy bulk screws from the vendors in WS...
---
Then it's a latency issue, which is always worse at that event because of the amount of people. It causes huge issues with damage registering too. Servers aren't my area of expertise but I definitely think Bethesda need better ones.
---
definitely need more shout outs like this from people more involved in the game. it is unfair for so much pressure to be on the CMs for quick and detailed responses, but they've been our only line of communication, really. at least for me personally, things like this would not be as huge of a deal if they just acknowledged us right away and made it a priority to have things fixed if they aren't right immediately following a major release.
---
I get that shit happens too, and not everything in this game is going to be perfect, but this game cant afford bad rep. it just cant. a bunch of people still look at this game as if it is the same game from November 2018, even though it isn't at all, and its because of the negative journalism, and that stems from problems like this that could be solved by actually testing features, making the features available to the PTS prior to launch, and acting swiftly and communicating quickly when they inevitably have missteps.
---
I greatly appreciate this, but there is still no official announcement on the lack of SCORE from events. CMs commented on it here and there, but they are buried in the sub, and i guarantee the great majority haven't seen what they said, which by the way, was that SCORE was never intended to be given from events, and the Seasons page that says they do is a mistake. that they meant you get score from *the dailies and weeklies* that have you do events, not the events themselves. this is pretty huge in both the miscommunication, and what it means for the grind, and i think everyone deserves a proper follow up on that.
---
it's one of the reasons i usually mod their games, for qol if not just for bug fixes and work arounds.
---
They started preserving technology and old world documents. Took a looooong while for it to turn into hoarding laser rifles in their bunkers.
---
Solved: thanks to u/GoldSkull12. I was unaware that / key effected walk speed.
---
Omg ty.
---
Hi. I saw somebody post this earlier. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj8wac/psa_here_are_the_nw_christmas_and_halloween/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
The event isnt live yet, its coming next patch
---
Thank you. I think in my mind I just assumed it was proximity based or something. Or that public teams were considered differently but it does make a lot of sense.  
---
I suppose the silver lining is I've got 4 points to stick somewhere!
---
I think I'll do the same. They also reported they'll have a double score weekend **[in an article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates)** from July 23-27, which would throw this off. Though it makes me wonder whether I should put off doing my weeklies until then for that week? :\
---
BTW anyone know if Bethesda has confirmed that they're going to fix events not giving score for people (and how much?)?
---
Yes, I got it as a gift from a friend. 
---
It works the same on private servers and since I observed the bots on private servers as well I can only speculate that this was a public server before it lost it's last "normal" user and was put on the private server list without actually resetting it. Don't ask me about details, I have no idea how Beth handles this behind the scenes. :)
---
I've seen this four times so far. The first two, the server disconnected me after \~20 minutes so whenever I see this now I just quit and restart the game to get an actual fresh server.
---
Upvote for title alone lol
---
I thought that all the special stats max at 25?
---
I'm level 275 when the Legendary run started and I leveled up 3 times on day 1 joining events-focused teams, and twice joining building teams and using the extra INT to farm super mutants. It's not impossible. Just imagine that you're running double XP weekend for 10 weeks.
---
*water tank was full of mini nukes and it exfuckingsplodes*
---
They’re working on that too. They can do more than one thing at a time, although I can understand how that might be hard to believe.
---
You don’t have to be close to them at all I don’t think
---
Just seen this! Exciting
---
Thats a good idea! Definitely time to look into those other perk cards.
---
I went to Hemlock Holes there’s usually a grafton monster and two snallygasters
---
1*
---
Lucky hole mine + excavator PA.  You will never want for lead again.  
---
Only problem is if you don't have enough acid to convert the lead ore, have to farm snallygasters for that.  I still think this method beats out any lead scrapping route in efficiency by a wide margin.
---
Aaah shit my lead and adhesive
---
Nice 👌 only 94 more! 😆
---
Are you being sarcastic?
---
Great, have you tried the rewards out yet?
---
Danse likes this!!
---
Hopefully it comes back in the form of:
---
- Insert any ammo you don't want in bulk the same way you'd drop it into the stash or container (only show ammo that can be transferred to converter)
---
- Select the type of ammo you want out
---
- Walk away... and when you come back, pick up your ammo
---
- Let unconverted / yet to be processed ammo just sit there, like it would sit in the stash or container
---
- Have a 1-screen help option that explains conversion rates for those that care about such things
---
Still waiting for my huge creature kill reward. I've killed the queen hundreds of times.
---
Huh? Mine is working but we all know how weird some stuff can be.
---
Yeah i got the sink and im pretty much done
---
If you do west tek runs, then look for Angry Turtle's guide to boosting XP. Basically, take herbivore, equip strange in numbers, and eat brain fungus soup and cranberry relish, and constantly pop berry mentats. You should be killing level 68 overlords at 400+XP per mutant, and the level 48 ones at 300 per kill.
---
Bethesda posted a roadmap on ITV, both coming later this month. 
---
EDIT: included link and clarified where I saw it
---
Okay well let's get this petition started for Ron Pearlman to narrate the intro
---
Glad you found this to be helpful!
---
Any rifle can one shot just about any enemy, that's about your build. It's certainly not specific to a gauss shotgun. I also call horseshit on "five shotting the queen." I certainly never saw anything like that and I run a shotgun build at low health.
---
I  thought that was pretty obvious, but yes. Very sarcastic.
---
Well yea but you have to be at 0 to get the full 50% dmg boost
---
That's not how QA works... they test if it's functional based on the specs provided, not if it's convenient for people with a million rounds of ammo to pass through it.  As long as ammo goes in, points get recorded and ammo comes out it passes QA.
---
I swapped the teams focus and it didn't break the bond. I'm just wondering if the xp gained in the event is during the event or just at it's conclusion.
---
Just FYI I did mention the excavator PA, the mine,  and acid at the bottom of the post.
---
I'm level 227 and I play for 6-10 hours a day "being unemployed and all" and I'm running a full unyielding set. I think I came across a bug I forgot to mention. If you level up 20+ times BUT *do nothing with the level up* it seems to level you up as fast as you did when you started saving up the levels. So say your level 200 and you start saving levels, at level 220 you will need the same amount of xp to get to 221 as you needed to get to level 201. I hope that makes sence. At least a little bit... I didn't want to say anything (becouse I don't want it patched.) Witch I also why you haven't seen a post about it... Becouse the other people that are saving levels probably haven't noticed that they are leveling up as fast as they did at a lower level.
---
I hope that maybe explained how I level up as fast.
---
Nope. I think the max is 100, as i have seen people use exploits to stack chems up to 100. Naturally you cant get to those levels legit.
---
We're QA my friend
---
If you had ps4 I would’ve made you a a lvl 50 with good mods and a good bit of ammo
---
Here is a video of Tyr doing it.

---
That is true.  For some reason I just never go the resort.
---
Im definitely grind the shit out of the SBQ, that event gives 1k points already!
---
🕦😆🤷‍♂️
---
Jesus Christ you're actually calling it "2 days too late".  We are truly in a generation of instant gratification or burn the mother fucker down.
---
Aww, that's incredibly kind of you, thank you :)
---
Sounds like you need to open a Ghillie Gumps!
---
Or escape on keyboard.
---
Oops...ya caught me.  It was a long post and I didn't read it all. My bad
---
Yep. Did Encryptid last night, got not only the stupid respawn bug that makes you lose all rewards, but had a solid 10 FPS the entire fight. Dont get me wrong, I usually get about 30-40 frames on that event, for obvious reasons. But 10? Damn.
---
Lol no problem
---
I am not sure, going to have to wait for a data mine or comparison.
---
Lmao a fat blunt
---
I made a post about missing items from the flyboy Bundle if you can take a look at it ♥️
---
Tbh everything is a bit meh. PA skins might be good if I actually even used PA and there’s a good few PA skins as rewards. Weapon skins on offer are a bit crap too, nothing special that stands out. 
---
The lunchboxes are useless for me and the CAMP items aren’t great. If the sink gave purified water it’s probably be a bit OP but as another Reddit user pointed out, something between Purified and Dirty Water would have been at least better. Not even gonna get into the Ammo Converter because it’s already been addressed.
---
Fireworks? Mmmm k..... Atoms, scrip, bullion and caps are pretty much all I have to gain from it. Maybe the secret fireplace door if I even get that far without getting burnt out and giving up, but even at that I mean what’s the point of a “secret” door if everyone knows it’s a damn door.
---
Oh I'm sure they're going to change the interface but what about the horrendous conversion rates? 5-1 for many ammo types, 7.5-1 for .308? Unless they change those too even with a nicer interface the 'converter' will still be worthless.
---
I’d say it’s more of a “let’s make people buy their way though” kind of thing, since you’ve already put in stupid effort and don’t want to throw it away. There are things in this game I don’t have after 800 hours, now apparently there are more. I’m not playing this game as a second job.
---
Raider Punk gives you Cryptid hunting quests. The Radio Network is always listening.
---
PTW!
---
No worries.
---
I haven't seen that. Lots claim but I've not seem proof. Seeing is believing for me
---
Leaving out general spoilers here, It's going to be at a specific location with a supporting quest and items specific to the encounter. Having played it on PTS I thought the event was great but if they want to spend time tweaking it who am I to complain?
---
Plus it has zero correspondence to the theme of this season, so it double doesn't fit. It's just sat on asset dumping because it's what they had on deck. which is weird because the ghillie suits make up the majority of score rewards. 
---
What is their thought process? 🙄
---
It is related to the healing factor mutation.  Kill all enemies in the area, Switch weapons and fire once.  Quickly fast travel and it works 90% of the time.  It is a pain in the ass but you can work around it.
---
Bethesda: “Fallout 76 will not be pay to win”
---
Bethesda:...
---
I don't think this is an unpopular opinion. Bethesda has really leaned into this time-gate, daily log in bullshit and it fuckin sucks.
---
I was just about to make this post... I need a way to get rid of them. Current idea is a vending machine with scrip written on it and 25 caps per scrip
---
BE25 handmade with commando and sneak attack perks and nerd rage
---
I now have 2 alts filled with legendaries. once this 3rd alt hits 50 it's gonna be getting filled as well. 
---
one day i feel like the limit will be upped but not by much
---
Yeah I don't get secret doors, use a regular door and lock it if you want to keep people out, and if you don't? Why bother with a secret door?
---
Thank you so much for the clarification!
---
being just over level 50 and having chosen to get my adrenaline to 3* before taking Gun-Fu..
---
my plan is to bum around in the forest until I can eke out 2 levels to throw into gun-fu...
---
The complaint isn't exactly that you have to grind for dailys although that is part of it.
---
The main complaint is after that you cannot progress from casual play very much. So if you miss dailys or weeklys you get a lil screwed. 
---
This is mostly because the score is bugged.
---
Have you considered doing other things than farming legendaries? You're just swimming against the tide otherwise.
---
I sell them for my daily 1400 at least part of it, I just like you have way to much scrip fodder. They actually sell for a reasonable amount with Hard Bargain 3 and a Formula-P.
---
I've done the grind today. Got rid of all the ammo I didn't want and bought the ammo I did. Took ages. Anything would-be better than the way it works now. Why can't I just enter the number of ammo I want to get rid of and get the value added to my account. Doing 12, 24 at a time is awful.
---
/yawn
---
Or a semi-transparent version of him you can summon called the Holo-Grahm....
---
I haven’t played in about a month or so. Is there an event going on right now or something? Boosted legendary drops?
---
Kill reset repeat.
---
Much like grinding The Whitesprings minus the bloaty boys and nuke zone.
---
Charleston Capital building can be Ok too.
---
Huh, I never thought of alts. I just assume that there is  no shared inventory haha.
---
You could try getting on Discord and finding FO servers with looking-for-group posts
---
Appalachia.
---
While I don't have an answer for you I just want to say that if yu don't find a solution and your THAT desperate to get rid of it just move your camp and it forcefully removes everything.
---
Well the Chinese to infiltrate the US before war in fact in mama dolce you can find a military base
---
No there isn’t... it’s strange. Maybe some tweaked numbers behind scenes
---
If you want a guaranteed 3* legendary enemy everytime just watch this [vid](https://youtu.be/japlXR1hYGg). It is an exploit though if you're against that.
---
Yeah it's getting to that point when you are about to post it as well haha. But yeah it's getting harder each time and I'm not sure.
---
I only keep 2 and 3 star weapons that I am going to scrip.  I take all 1 star weapons and all armor and put it in the register in the Rusty Pick.  I also put 2 and 3 star heavy weapons in there cause they are just not worth the weight to scrip ratio.
---
I sell scrip weapons for 10c per scrip point in my machines and they don't go fast.  Most folks have this problem in that they have too many.
---
This at least keeps the weight in my stash down.
---
I was about to come here and comment marathoner for “casual” play.  I’ve only begun switching from 5 pts to 1 pt adrenaline recently, and marathoner is great.  Gun fu, if anyone reading this doesn’t use it already, is great not only on guns but also melee.  Action PERSON is one I have dropped over time but it’s good to have it back.
---
Usually I ran escape artist, adren, covert/ninja, gun fu, dodgy.  Though dodgy got sidelined for action person at times, it’s great running them both.
---
I’ll tell you one thing tho:  goat legs at 50/100 instead of 40/80 would be freaking awesome if it stacked properly with gear fall damage reduction.
---
Yeah i have a glitched ufo circular camp that took over 2 hours to make lol thats why i dont wanna move it.
---
the complaint is the UI not the function
---
Gun-Fu and QOL cards, I had adrenaline 5. Gun-fu is great fun for mobs and ads @ nuke zones, so glad they borked adrenaline so I tried something new.
---
The pack came with a bunch of stuff, letting people keep an emote is harmless
---
Nice thanks!
---
I didn't think about the theme, but yeah, now that i think about it, it's even more disappointing. 
---
As for the "why" it's just lazyness imho. But that's classic Bethesda: they mix awesome things with generaly terrible ones, all garnished with fresh bugs.
---
Shut up and give me what I want right NOW! 
---
There's no event like that. But there is an event called "Legendary run" which is a huge grinding.
---
Private teams is just the normal way of making teams-- Inviting people via the Social menu.
---
Yes. I'll include the double xp weekend (16-20 July) and double score week (23-27 July) as well in some way.
---
The only thing to do is make your voice known that this is horrible and wait for them to change it. Never think to yourself its good enough when something clearly isnt
---
I'm on a steel and copper deposit by 76 overlooking the junkyard there. It's a good spot lol
---
i only had 1 in adrenaline. Just slapped on a thru-hiker. Adrenaline helped against SBQ and colossus wendigo. And that's about it. Everything else dies quick.
---
Time. You get 1 shot in NW before multiple loading screens and sitting in lobby for a couple minutes, then another loading screen. You load in, the guy next to you has an SSD and got to a big box with a handmade and marine armor...you get a yellow box with wood armor and a scoped western revolver. You die because he had better loot rng and are now back in loading screens and queue for another match.
---
Adventure mode you die and seek revenge. 1 loading screen and I'm back in the action and having fun again.
---
Yup. Like mining for gold in big piles of shit.
---
I'll add it with the double xp/score options tomorrow.
---
Yeah I have seen someone put a 1☆ legendary in their machine for 8k.
---
Nah this is popular, fk seasons
---
I went into NW to get the Weekly done, and saw all of the perk card packs I had, so I started opening those. I wound up with a bunch of Halloween paints, the overseer's chair, the ring of firepit, wasteland loveseat, some other weapon skins, a trophy, bunch of stuff.
---
The converters concept is amazing, it's execution is absolute dog shit, it's clear no one in the development team ever tested this piece of shit UI on it
---
It's not. Sometimes it's a pack of wolves
---
Are you deleting from the very top item that relies on the stack.
---
If you are solo in a public team, you still get the benefits of lone wanderer while still getting the benefit of 1 bond of the public team, group perks  (such as inspirational) do not work.
---
Once you have one more person on the team, standard team bonuses apply, so lone wanderer is out, Insprirational is in, and you get the benefits of the bonds.
---
If you are soloing, it’s always worth having a public team, but you might have people join (unless you’re on a private server then have at it.)
---
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME TO GET OUT OF BETA AND THEN ADDING AN ENDGAME
---
The sink is great for my cliff top dry camp, just moved to herbivore so can craft more easily now.
---
When and how they fix this all depends on how they broke it.  If it's something that's fixable server side then it's going to be a lot easier and quicker to fix than if it's something client side.
---
If it's a client side problem then the hotfix that would be required have a history of being reserved for emergency situations only, i.e. the time they accidentally merged an update with a partial old build and broke a bunch of bug/exploit fixes and when they needed to disable a bunch of stuff for dupe exploits.  
---
Even though Adrenaline is broken it doesn't actually break the game so it's unlikely to be a priority for a hotfix, and even if it was they would still have to fix it and then push that patch through cert with sony and microsoft first before releasing it.
---
Now that I think about it, if Bethesda let players get the emote they shouldn’t be able to take it away. It’s not like the emote give you an advantage. I guess it’s just a matter of opinion, because either way it isn’t that large of a difference.
---
I've done other stuff like rebuild my place and put more things to sell. But with the Legendary run, I basically have no choice in getting legendary items while participating with this event.
---
I've been looting them off of cultists and sometimes blood eagles in the savage divide.
---
Not really against exploits as long as it doesn’t screw up other players fun. I will definitely check out the video. Eventually exploits get patched. So im still looking for new areas that have a chance to spawn legendarys
---
Gunfu is amazing, pairs well with the perk that lets you select body parts in vats
---
There's not. yet.
---
I use a private server to store stuff in a suitcase and then i swap and before that i gave my pals stuff to hold and swap. If you play with people you trust you could do that.
---
takes 2 mins to get out of the vault and you could make a camp right outside. There's 950ish of storage space straight away. Or level the alt and a bit and get armour that offers weapon weight reduction. Then you can hold more.
---
It's only level if you've played it enough. The build in NW still an edge for a level 25+ with the right perk cards vs a fresh character. I didnt start having fun in NW until I had the basic commando build perk cards. Random team mates are usually just going to hide in bushes too.
---
Also agreed. After being pissed of by all of last years decisions i thought about trying out wastelanders (which i did for a few yours, it's cool a bit like Fallout), but then i thought i will wait how this season pass scam works. And now, i don't feel like investing any more time in this product.
---
Furthermore i was very interested in Starfield, but i don't think i can thrust Bethesda anymore and certainly won't buy it in the first half year (if at all).
---
I think Fallout 3's trade ui would work wonders for the ammo converter.
---
Awesome, I'll look there now, thanks!
---
Does anyone know if Inspirational perk work now if you are solo in a public team?
---
Curious.. because Lone Wanderer no longer works if you are solo in a public team.
---
Right!  I mean its a free market.  Maybe someone will be like "I MUST HAVE THAT!?!?"
---
Sounds like you need a mule then mate.
---
That does help. I may try that and get my brother to hold all my legendary and some other stuff while I get my alt character.
---
now that I think about it, that is totally possible
---
Hitting up hornwright testing site 3 immediately followed by lucky hole smelts down to 1800-2000 for me with super duper and excavator.  Few server hops at Tanagra town stocks enough acid or the train yard in the bog now as long as it spawns snallys instead of robots.  
---
If you have a month of first and do the run a couple times a week you'll be sitting on a big lead reserve.  Have 50,000 lead right and around the same for steel right now.  Don't need to bother with farming for....I don't know, maybe a week lol.
---
So fucking annoying, and given that there such a tiny margin for making it to level 100, this needs a quick fix.
---
i did that 5 times and not once got a 3\* enemy. Decided it wasn't worth it.
---
Good call broham.
---
Yes, please shhhhhhhhhh....
---
(And tell me how I can do this too)
---
Have you made any mules or alts to store them on?
---
Personally, I have three characters all over 50, so I spread out my legendary excess to script among all three. It helps with weight and keeps a cycle of new (and possibly better) legendaries coming in. It has also gotten all of my alts to 30k caps quickly. By the time they were level 50 they had 1000 script to hit the purveyor with. They also had the fixer plan so there was a chance they get that drop. 
---
One example, I made a new alt to try out junkies build. When I created him I moved a bunch of weapons over to sell in his vendor and got him to 30k caps within a day. Makes leveling much easier. 
---
 You could also drop off some random ones to friends or new players. 
---
GL! It really is a good problem to have!
---
Look for Awol Armaments event to the east
---
Yes so there is my starting foundation and the side closest to the edge has a stair and attached to the stair going up is another foundation with another stair attatched to it and another foundation attatched to that and yes i am trying ti delete the top foundation.
---
Thanks man
---
You have a lot of great points and good ideas. I agree with the majority of your suggestions, although I can think of a few tweaks or alternatives.
---
Bringing back Survival is definitely an option, but I do think there are a few changes I'd want made on top of what you suggest to help attract a wider audience. For example fast travel being limited to RR stations, V76, and your camp/workshops made traversing the map more tedious than it needed to be. Considering how large the map is and how few players can be on a server I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for more locations that would allow for fast travel. I think it would also help cut down on spawn camping if there wasn't only a handful of locations a player could FT or respawn.
---
Survival Mode rewards and challenges also need to be reworked. Disregarding how awful most of the Survival Mode weapons were, the challenges often had nothing to do with PvP or actually playing Survival Mode. Many players would do all the prep work in Adventure Mode then hop into Survival for 5 minutes to earn the reward. That needs to be fixed in order to disincentivize PvE players from entering the mode and getting themselves killed. If they don't then we'll just have a repeat of PvE players clamoring for changes that negatively effect PvP because they don't have an understanding of it (and we all know which group Bethesda chooses to listen to when it comes to PvP).
---
I agree that VATS probably should be removed from PvP, although I'd like to play devil's advocate and throw in a counter point. Aiming in Fallout is sub-par for an FPS. Some players (especially console players) struggle to aim in this game and VATS can be an equalizer. In its current state it is certainly OP as it's basically a bootleg aimbot. If damage was reduced significantly or had a lower cap it would help keep it from being over powered while still offering a handicap for those that need it. 
---
Your suggestion to copy the way Nuclear Winter handles aid is great. Healing should be cut off by damage. I also agree that dropping aid should be removed. It was a stupid change. From my experience it was never helpful taking another players aid since it's so plentiful I'm throwing it on the ground in Adventure mode constantly so I'm not constantly over-encumbered and losing nice chunk of your aid when you died meant you either had a real tough time rematching whoever just killed you or you were just going to hop back to a stash box or Adventure mode to get more aid. I spent less time in Survival mode because of this even when I wanted to play it.
---
Honestly, there are a lot of changes they made for NW that should be copied if they want to balance PvP. Stealthboys should also work the same way as NW. Shooting should disable them immediately. Further down your post you talk about the CSS and how it should also be disabled while attacking. I can get behind this, and would like to add the chameleon armor should function the same. You should not be allowed to be invisible and attack period. 
---
Your idea for Teslas is pretty interesting. I think it would help reduce the effectiveness in PvP pretty significantly, but personally I would rather see the Tesla have it's damage reduced in PvP significantly while still retaining it's incredibly easy to use function. Going back to my previous point about aiming being bad in 76, I think the Tesla is another tool for players with poor aim. Rather than raise the skill floor of the weapon I think it should be nerfed and turned into a beginners/niche weapon.
---
A nerf to legacies would be great but their removal would be even better. If Bethesda has no plans to fix them and add them back into the loot pool then the should not exist in the game. Very few players obtained them legitimately, and the majority are the product of exploits. If you want to balance PvP you can't have broken weapons or weapons with an advantage that can't be obtained anymore.
---
I thought it was such an obvious thing that each weapon class should have it's own damage cap, but apparently the devs disagree with us. It's hard to believe professionals implemented a flat cap on weapons as an attempt to balance when an amateur could point out the multitude of flaws with that approach. I don't know what the exact numbers should be, but I think it's safe to say auto weapons should do significantly less per shot than semi autos, and sniper rifles a should be able to one shot kill any player that wasn't built to be a tank with a headshot.
---
More PvP events with better rewards are something I think every PvP player has asked for. I have seen many requests for Faction PvP events and I think this would be the best way to start including them. Rewards could be based on the faction you side with for the event, with each side having 1-3 rare and unique rewards and the winning team also earning a small amount of additional Faction Rep. If PvP wasn't so disliked among the majority of the community this would have been a no brainier when Wastelanders released.
---
Automatically putting Adventure mode players in pacifist mode should happen whether they make any of these other changes or not. It's clear most players don't want to PvP, but it's also pretty obvious how many players fail to understand the mechanics of the game and end up putting themselves in situations where they are forced to PvP. Making pacifist the default option would prevent a lot of players from having these negative experiences that make them believe PvP is toxic and should be removed.
---
Again, your points were pretty much all excellent in my opinion. PvP was something that was advertised from the games announcement and it shouldn't be removed just because "Fallout was never PvP" or "PvP is broken and there are better games for it." With that logic series would never evolve and this game would have been abandoned within the first month. We need more PvP players to be more vocal about what we want and our suggestions to make the game better; thoughtful posts like this that show that we care about both sides rather than toxic posts from PvE players that only care about getting PvP removed for those that enjoy it.
---
I figured! Other people aren't picking up on that unfortunately.
---
I'm with you. Oh, you're going to fix something that should have never left the first draft table in the first place? It took people complaining to get them to say something when if they had any idea what they were doing, it wouldn't have been pushed out in it's current state. A tweet from a dev as opposed to an official statement is also head-scratching. It's turtles all the way down with this dev team. Never ending ball dropping.
---
i ran into a legendary wendigo colossus in the sundew grove, so the spawns are active but maybe the actual event triggers not?
---
found it, sorry it was from ITV, not social media!
---
I got recommended in putting all legendary into alt account.  So I may try that.
---
I have not found any gun to be required for you to keep. They are helpful guns but usually not endgame grind worthy. Good example is the Final Word a pretty solid 50 cal machine gun. I really enjoy using it simply because I have not gotten a better one yet. Give me an instigating 50 cal and I would likely trade it out quickly. It’s your call on how much you like them
---
You can craft all of those again once you know the plan.
---
My challenges complete before I've finished them and after I finish them. Got some MAD double xp today
---
Actually you are wrong. privatly held companys are not traded public. The ownership however can and often is still in stocks.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately\_held\_company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company)
---
LOL, yeah I’m sure they are....I would like to at least hope they are anyways but that was just my initial reaction when I saw the post....So that’s what I commented
---
And the infinite crafting solution. Use scrapped assaultron head and 2 steel craft assaultron helmet with super duper. Now scrap the helmet for scrap assaultron head. Do this as many times as you not getting bored of it.
---
That’s not bad!
---
Kinda skimpy, but I’m not too mad since Wastelanders was a big enough drop to excuse this one being lighter on content.
---
If the entire left half is useless, delete from the item so its footprint is smaller. Otherwise, make that spin button have a function. 
---
You already know the entire interface is terrible. Whoever thought that up, and everyone who approved it needs to have a stinky fish cooked in their microwave everyday for a year.
---
Yeah I have actually got recommended in an alt account. I never actually thought about it till someone mentioned it.
---
...and now add SS to that too.
---
Some people don't get jokes, that's totally fine!
---
Afaik bethesda is owned by zenimax, which is not publicly traded but does have "venture capital" investors.
---
100% agree with u, stopped playing a few months ago cuz fuck the ss armour. Fuck the limitations on script and gold, fuck this game lol I’ll hop back on when the brotherhood dlc happens and when I blow through the 8 missions we’re going to get I will put the game back down until something good happens. When the game starts to feel like a chore it’s time to put it down
---
Yup. At least it isn’t another pump action shotgun skin.
---
This shows that they only did functional testing but not actual play testing as some companies have totally separate job functions for.
---
He gets there the final day of the season I'm sure. I doubt anything happens if you don't get there and he does. Or if you get there first nothing happens either.
---
The collosus doesnt only spawn from the event, he has a random chance to spawn in specific nuked areas
---
Yeah, but with the event going on, its hard to keep up.
---
False. The mistress items require the item as a crafting ingredient. If you toss voice of set you cannot craft a new one.
---
Just wondered as it sometimes seems arbitrary what you can and can't delete.
---
No one like nw most people only play for rewards so we bush camp
---
OMG I would love this.  My old armor had me immune to fall damage.  I switched armor and took a leap off a cliff and I was like "Oh man this is going to suck." and then Serendipity kicked in and I was like "WOOHOO!"
---
I would make room for 2 points in goat legs if it was 100% reduction.
---
In a team yes use it, +15% XP is always nice, also join Building teams, not just event teams.
---
I did the one nuclear winter one yesterday where you only have to go up a rank which is easy especially if you just use a new character or a low rank character
---
Maybe stop doing that, I’m not even in fo for pvp but I still want to play the mode for the rewards
---
Given how almost anytime there is widespread complaining about something Bethesda responds, this isn’t much of a surprise. FO76 gets better and better!
---
Great! Now what about the menus that haven’t worked properly in months? Accepting invites, adding friends, item previews, etc?
---
Amen.
---
Same. I really can’t do more than 2-3 repeatable per day. I’m burned out after all the loading screens by then. 
---
Not to mention the rep grind I’m still on lol.
---
I would LOVE to see someone buy a 1☆ Pipe Pistal for 8k haha. Who knows that guy "May" get lucky.
---
I love it that it’s coming to game pass just like when gta 5 came for those couple months. There was actually low levels to do the early missions with being I never got into playing it back when it first came out so I’m only level 68 and it’s hard to find people to do the missions you needed to do being everyone was level 300+. I have owned fallout 76 since launch and I have always enjoyed it so it’s awesome to see it come to Xbox game pass
---
That's funny, iirc that Westworld game ripped off fallout shelter. On topic, I wonder it they're gonna show pvp or would the community not want that?
---
I will say that I think microtransactions are a shitty trend that give game developers an incentive to design jewelry over "ReAl ConTeNt", whatever the viewer's opinion of that is. 
---
It makes me sad that we likley get more fireplaces that cost real money, but I don't think it's "evil".
---
It is for purchase under energy. For some reason they labeled it 10mm
---
i rename the legendaries i am gonna scrap to AAAAAAA. so when i sort by name i know which ones i can scrap and which ones i am keeping.
---
Yes, if you can get a group, I would recommend using Inspriational to get the 15% bonus XP.  Stack it with Cranberry Relish for an additional 10% (20% with Herbivore), well rested of 5%, and the 25%-100% bonus from lunchboxes.
---
You need a good farming route on top of that, but if you do something simple with a group you can probably farm some XP quickly, especially doing events as a group.
---
Good grief 😂
---
ROFL!
---
sounds good
---
Ah, true about it maybe being patched. Then I recommend these three areas. The Vantage, Charleston Capitol Building, (the one where you had to go to the DMV filled with ghouls) and Harper's Ferry.
---
I second this.  What a great advert.  Even better is the awesomeness of the service.  Perhaps consider recruiting some Hunts' Brand Survival Kit representatives on other platforms.  That's something I can get behind.  Ps4 here.
---
Thanks I'll check later.
---
My flamer is so happy right now
---
Is the SBQ part of that challenge bugged for everyone?
---
That's a really smart idea. Keep forgetting that there's naming into this game.
---
I haven’t participated in Meat Week.  Is it better than Fascnaght? (Or however u spell it)
---
Same issues here, encrypted and sbq are usually bad on Xbox but now it’s somehow even worse almost unplayable for me. So bad that I’ll be at full health one frame and half health the next from damn mirelurk kings bum rushing me. Even simple events like the messenger have horrid frame rate drops now. Don’t get me wrong I’m still playing and enjoying most of my time adventuring but I’d really like a fix to this.
---
when you say treasure hunter outfit, do you meam just the outfit or the hat as well? This is very nice of you guys and i'll happily donate a coupme of treasure hunter hats until the promotion runs out
---
Ha! It did. They used the same code that was visible because it had the same bugs at start up that were in Shelter.
---
Should we submit help.bethesda.net tickets to get these reimbursed?
---
I would say it is about the same.
---
Yeah its annoying
---
I’ll give you that, but it’s like they released it without ANY play testing whatsoever. They could have had five people try it and four of them would say it was shit and the fifth is Todd Howard with those glasses with the fake nose &amp; moustache on pretending to be a player
---
I posted this earlier and it got deleted for violating rule 1. Expect the same.
---
That damn bug cost me my Vault a number of times!
---
National Research Center is decent.  Any office type buildings usually have them 
---
I’d mark screws as junk you want to find.  It’s easier to track when searching. Globes, Desk Fans, Typewriters and Toy cars/trucks are your best bet.
---
I dont want to be negative but how did it get past him in the first place..?
---
My gauss mini is only used at SBQ and Encryptid because it's just too much for anything else. It's not even about feeding it ammo, it's just too OP to use on a ghoul or whatever. You might get more use out of the shotgun.
---
Plus the last time I used it at SBQ, it (B/33/90) was acting like a magic weapon and I ruined the fight for everyone in seconds not realizing it was me, and nearly ruined a second one before I caught on and quit firing.
---
I think people would figure a way to troll with them
---
Wait what? Is herb giving 2x on mighty relish?
---
Eh, I'm not too worried about that.  I guess I look at the converter as a potential source "bonus" ammo rather than an efficient source of it.
---
And there are so many scrips to buy garbage legendaries with
---
If you miss 5 days, and hate NW, you will need 70k exp per day everyday along with all the dailies and weeklies to finish 1 day before the event ends.
---
Yes you are exactly right.  It's infuriating and this has been a pattern since day one.
---
apparently you can only rename 99 things. I wouldn't know as i haven't renamed that many things to find out.
---
Happened to me on Xbox one. I believe it's cross-platform.
---
As much as I like the idea, I think some people would uses them to drop you into a bad situation (like trap camps, or off cliffs) just to be toxic.
---
Exactly. Not sure why this has been down voted so much.
---
All MMORPG styled games have a grind for gear/items.
---
I'm finding it strange, yet pretty comical, that so many people bitch about a grind, wanting everything handed to them, and yet also bitch about people spending THEIR OWN money on microtransactions to unlock stuff immediately.
---
I love me some irony, but it still blows my mind.
---
Loaded for me but it was just a link talking about the update
---
yup, they changed the mutations to also affect the bonus stuff, as a herbivore i get +20% exp from relisj, but pepperoni rolls give 0 weight
---
You have to buy it in little fuel filled 10 mm casings 😂😂 just be sure not to load the wrong 10 mm ammo into your submg/pistol or hand go BOOM 🤣🤣
---
Carry be damned. Thank you!
---
Yes, I think this was how it was at the start, somewhere it changed, and now it seems to be back.  I personally prefer it this way..
---
My son will be born at the end of August so I probably won’t get to play the One Wasteland for some time. 
---
I will trade my first born son for .308 rounds. Any takers??
---
All rise and perfect storm are the only ones i kept. The rest are pretty useless.
---
For the enclave. But yes already canceled my sub.
---
So why are people assuming that the +25 doesnt cap out? Has anyone actually made it far enough to see that it doesnt? IDK why but it seems pretty unreasonable to assume it wont. At the end if it doesnt cap out it would be 3500 a rank.
---
The few times i joined till no we all did not have mics but i joined event teams we all go to events and complete them and get up to 4x more xp depending on the amount of teammates. It also differences what kind of perk you get depending in what kind of category team you are
---
Fallout isn't built for PvP so it is never going to work
---
Do other carry food buffs like ribeye and radstag drop to 0 as well or how is the bonus affected
---
This post made me realize that I have never once tried to convince them or take anyone back alive.  lol.  That's probably a red flag.
---
I'd be fine with the conversion rate if it had a higher cap or no cap.
---
In 2 weeks i think u can use atoms to pay
---
Destiny 2 game model
---
Yup. Unlike other AAA online titles, FO76 doesn't seem to get ignored by the Devs. Looking at you Rockstar...
---
What QA team?
---
I put them up on my vendor for 10k. I've sold several.
---
Being on a team gives you bonus stats/xp, whether y’all play together or not.
---
Reminds me of trying to buy stuff in animal crossing. It's either buying in singles or "bulk" which is 5.
---
Just ignore the markers and go to penny's terminal and print the access card
---
You are correct about Bethesda being owned by their parent company, Zenimax; however, a company as large as Zenimax will almost certainly not have VCs investing in them. They probably have private equity investors instead, but these are not the same as the mystical "shareholders" that everyone loves to hate.
---
You don’t really have to do anything at all. 
---
But all teams have different bonuses. Just do whatever you’re getting that bonus for. 
---
Event teams give more event xp and hunter team gives more legendary kill xp. The builder team gives more Intelligence which gives more do earned for everything you do. 
---
But basically the more players in a team the better the bonus. 
---
If you’re low level I would suggest the last one.
---
Makes sense?
---
Yess in two weeks it has been just a few days you’re not that much behind
---
Seems like I got a bunch of copper at Sons of Dane, the shooting gallery behind the barn. Not tons perhaps, but a good chunk for a few minutes
---
Can't really argue with any of that tbh. I've seen it myself as well. The scrap box should be free to all imo, the sub should have other benefits that aren't QOL things like atoms and cosmetic stuff.
---
Ah yes I’ve notice some say XP and others say something else, thanks. Might have a go at joining some. Can I just join any or do you need to ask the leader first or out? Don’t wanna rock up and they be like “whose this guy with the mantra man outfit on?” 😂
---
Ya I’ve leveled up like 10 times in the last 2 days from well rested, canned meat stew, cranberry pie, and fully bonded team. I’ve been hitting that 10k xp score boost in like an hour it’s crazy
---
I guess that’s more incentive to get 1st and use the atoms on the ranks... I’d honestly prefer just a flat transaction to not have to pay for as many atoms
---
Really? I guess it just looks like Zorbo is way ahead
---
It doesn't let me. When i go to put in the second password nothing pops up but a return button
---
Noo you will be fine this type of teams is made so you can finally find people to play with so don’t worry
---
Are you super SURE though???
---
Only applies to the daily.
---
It is what it is
---
After two weeks. There’s no shame, some of us have jobs. ;)
---
I only got as far as I have so far because I was on isolation
---
No qualms with your alignment. Appreciate your support. Mine is cancelled as of 1 hr and 3 min ago. Fuck em til they fix shit.
---
ohh i'm with you now. well yeah that goes back to my original problem then.
---
Haha, yeah man if you lie to the Hunters and tell them you already killed the Former Raider and Rocksy told them to give you their cut you get 100 caps. You can do this for both Hunters (if they manage to stay alive that is) and get 200 caps per run. Then you can use the “I just want to talk” dialogue option to then say (if you have 8+ strength as there’s a strength check) “Come back to Crater you WILL die without us” and then once you get back to Rocksy tell her “a familiar face will be rejoining the crew after all” and you get a bit more faction rep than normal. 
---
The fact I can quote all of the dialogue options shows I definitely grind this daily too much. Probably a red flag too hahaha
---
Wow that's amazing! I've wanted one since The Walking Dead.
---
I’m actually level 187 but I normally just play solo and not read much on this new update, so kind unsure about things. Thanks for the info.
---
Atom be praised!
---
You're probably right, and I can't figure out which would be worse.
---
No QA team or one so out of touch that something like the ammo converter could pass play testing.
---
I played the &gt;!redacted!&lt; and I can tell you, the only difference I noticed between the closed &gt;!redacted!&lt; and the open beta was the flight controls felt better.
---
Hey there! You can file a support ticket for this [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10).
---
So far I've been using the ammo converter as intended, but I'm also your it to go afk/afc. That way if someone visits my camp they take pity on me 😂
---
cool, thanks
---
🤣😂🤣😂
---
Sure.....
---
They can't handle the truth!
---
Can you freaking imagine how many new bugs would be created if they tried such an undertaking?  They gotta catch up to where they want to be now.
---
Forgive me I don't mean to be insulting but you did tag these for search right?
---
I just ask because there are a fair number items that have screws. Ones not mentioned previously are toy cars, tongs, globes, coolant caps, the red fuel containers (cylindrical, not the gas cans)
---
Desk fans are all over the place so you should find those in almost any location. 
---
I'm not saying screws are a easy to come by, it's just not as bad as some people make it out.
---

 &gt; Hey there! You can file a support ticket for this [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10).
---
Good, I was on the fence about how bad it really was but any time they're willing to make something better... go for it.
---
As it is you can just spam the button to scrap and buy but the cap is the real kick in the nuts because you have to swap from scrap to buy several times just to get rid of a thousand .44 ammo.
---
If you’re on a public events team you just have to do an event to get the xp boost, your team doesn’t even need to be there
---
I've only done one day's worth so far and I'm already rank 5, so there are probably people at rank 10+ and no reports that it changes. So far it's increments of 25 each rank.
---
I'm sure in a week or so we'll have a much better understanding of the time requirements though. People are gonna experiment and find ways to speed things up.
---
Well like I’m currently out of work but ultimately, I don’t want to be playing this game. Wastelanders was a lot of fun cause I started the game with it but the grind to friendly alone has ruined the experience for me so far. I think I’ll make a new character to get a new challenge and such
---
Lol its not.
---
No problem. 
---
I’m a solo player myself. 
---
Great thing about these teams is that everyone is just doing it for the bonuses so it still kinda feels like you’re playing alone. 
---
If I were you I would start a builder team and just play like you normally do. Be sure to do your dailies and weeklies for the most amount of score tho.
---
They seem bugged. I did 3/5 and got the reward.
---
I think it's a really poorly designed board game. Give us a weekly roll of the die or cards that have us you do something for a huge score boost that can help us get past spaces quickly.
---
Well I'll be damned. Thank you.
---
Adding you in  10 min. Or so
---
That's exactly what I meant lol.
---
There was a spot that did say bonus score weekends but I couldn't find when it said
---
Not even grenades wakes that some bish up.
---
the stat line for ribeye tells me:
---
- 5 rads
---
- 0 hp
---
- 0 carry weight
---
- 0% food
---
i think as long as it is in the all [meat/plant] tab, then [carnivore/herbivore] will give it the 2x bonus to everything, and give 0 stats to the opposite food type.
---
Logic seems to physically hurt people these days.
---
Cheers, I will look at that when I log on in an hour or so.
---

---
Good luck!
---
Yes thanks for your feedback, 
---
I wouldn't agree on removing them since they are neat collectibles and the fact that this would piss 99% of the players owning one of, since they traded a lot to get them. I think a need is fitting well. 
---
Also liked your solution on fixing vats and teslas.
---
On mobile, I had to disable most/all of my content blockers, then it loaded.
---
I kind of hope they either just make a series out of Fallout 3 or stick to the lore somewhere we've never seen.
---
$148.50 to complete the board game entirely it seems, but after 2 weeks, have at it
---
you can already fast travel to camps
---
It don't matter how many times you mention it.  Someone else is going to come to reddit and think they're the first to have the problem without even a cursory search.
---
Ref: the 3,000 ammo converter threads.
---
Those damned mic sales folk!
---
I’d say tell Bethesda support
---
Does anybody know anything about score from events? Because I’ve noticed on their latest blog it doesn’t mention score from events anymore so I’m guessing we aren’t going to get them from events now at all? Sad
---
Better news is the announcement of the Fallout TV show
---
Well I don’t want the whole board just maybe up until the ghilie combat armor
---
Nocturnal Pitchforks are a GO!
---
Excited, maybe it sucks, maybe it doesn’t, but for now I can just be excited and enjoy the prospect. (:
---
But you can’t craft them correct?
---
If so I guess it’s just the way they implemented it. Or just a simple bug. Nothing new I guess
---
Someone already got to them in my game, so I went to the Flooded Trainyard. They're also usually there as well.
---
Hey find me sometime, IGN Pinky-Flashdancer, we can duo it.
---
"I think this guys sells mics" That part got me. 🤣
---
is it a staged weekly (X/5)?  those for whatever reason are rewarding it early at 3/5 instead of 5/5
---
yeah, they had to of gotten bored in there.
---
Stealth suit + Nukacrypt makes it easy once you have a nuclear keycard. I’m on PC, feel free to add me if you need help ign oominssi
---
Ohh no. Another franchise getting ruined soon
---
That may just be the waypoint bugging. If you remember what to do without it. Try that.
---
Being honest with the new public teams getting 10k xp isn’t that hard.. just put it to hunter have friends or randoms join. Then go down to the fissure site and kill the scorchbeasts. I think you get around 600-800 xp per scorchbeast(someone correct me), if you don’t know this they have a higher legendary spawn rate than other enemies. And while you wait for respawn switch the team to events and do some public events then come back and kill the scorchbeasts. (You can also throw and other xp buffs)
---
Dense for the win, no doubt.  I gave up dense for the Jetpack on SS....jury is still out.  Love my Jetpack, but Dense is another level of Awsome.
---
TBH, I wish series would start with a couple of episodes leading up to events, instead of jumping into the thick of it. 
---
I am curious with what FO lore they going to run with
---
My favorite thing about this game has been that it isn't as vapid as most MMOs. They should ignore how most MMOs do things and do things that make the playerbase happy.
---
Hmm good point. The only solution I can think of would be to add a report system or somehting but that'll ruin the fun for the trappers.
---
Grinding is not meaningfull or satisfieng progression (at least for a part of the playerbase).
---
I can already imagine it!every new episodes comes with new bugs and some old bugs from previous episodes.Then you have to wait for season 2 to fix the bugs from pilot episode.Im stoked!
---
Still no word about pets?
---
I agree with you, it’s actually not that bad once you learn how to spam sell your bulk ammo, then you can just use it every couple hours for the ammo you find around the world. But I’m a level 150 heavy gunner so my guns guzzle ammo, I run out fairly quickly
---
Actually, I can craft them. I just didn't have the resources to craft them at the time. Now that I do they are available for me to craft, although I haven't put them on my armor since it'd be a waste of flux
---
Wow I hope this lasts!
---
So the new collosus event is now in Patch 21 and the legendary perks got delayed until patch 22 in September?
---
It's not bugs! It's content 🤣😂
---
The same company also makes donuts that have a better recipe than the newest donut. You could try eating those instead.
---
Well that's silly and a waste of caps.
---
And this was a teammate??? Ugh
---
My wife thinks the game looks “gross” so I can’t even get her to play. It’s a bummer because it would be a lot of fun to play together.
---
With Todd as one of the executive producers... lol. It should be interesting. I'll watch it.
---
I hope they do some easter eggs in it that only players will get, and leave non players wondering things like "why the fuck do they keep finding so many oddly arranged skeletons  in toilet stalls" and "what was up with that room full of toilet plungers".
---
I mean if you consider a generator that produces 12 power (basically a water skin for the windmill) pay to win then that is a pretty nit picky and skewed view of it. At that point you are just looking to be angry.
---
I meant to a specific spot within the camp. Kinda like in fallout 4 and the workshops around Appalachia.
---
Only 18 at a time is a bit like work
---
Might be the same mechanic that caused legendary corpses/meatpiles to return to the spot they spawned if they got too far away from their spawn? We know Bethesda can't handle their shit so I'd see this as a valid option...
---
Yea I wanna get mine her own Xbox and tv, but all my wife does is walk around and pick junk up.
---
Honestly It might have been me lol. Just did the exact thing. 
---
I’m so sorry. But it’s just a hideous game mode imo(at least on PS4) 
---
And I can’t miss out on the dailies sadly...
---
they should rework the entire game and design an engine specifically for an online multiplayer game.
---
Gladly, I don't play this game on PC.
---
Too many cheaters.
---
Hmm haven’t seen them reward it early but will look more closely the next staged challenge
---
Can’t trust anyone in the wasteland! I lure low level players into my underground base and craft them lvl 20 heavy bear arms and lvl 25 excavator PA parts. That’ll show em! There are good players and evil players just like real life 🤔. Hope you guys meet some cool people too!!! Good luck 👍
---
My 3 random team yes actually played and we just won
---
I thought they made it so you could craft both voices and non voices skins?
---
Not really but I literally shouted "FUCK" at 3 AM last night because I killed a random protectron, non legendary, and walked up to it, looted a piece of aluminum from it and it exploded so loudly in my ear and make my heart fucking leap
---
It’s a bit repetitive but if you select “go back to main menu”, you can back out quickly.
---
Nice one! GZ mate
---
I'm very sorry this happened to them, but that shit's *hilarious*.
---
I don't think it is just waypoint. When i hack Penelope's terminal and go to enter the second password it just gives me a return screen. The quest as a whole doesnt seem to progress
---
Actually it is about the same system as 2018 when the game startet. The only difference is, that they don't give atoms directly and opened up another frustration level for some players and another monetization scheme for Bethesda.
---
I just had to check this, and they are showing up.  
---
They're both perfectly craftable, though the Camo one doesn't actually give you a Jetpack to use.  
---
It also show's up on every piece, with those resource requirements, and gives that part a camo paint job at the expense of the mod slot.  
---
As far as weird bugs go, this one's pretty amusing. Nothing like burning Flux and slots for a paint job!
---
Yea I hope she can find someone that is good bc all she has seen is the bad, :)
---
Casuals are supposed to buy ranks with real money you silly dilly
---
Un... no. At most it is $120 which buys 15,000 atoms.
---
Problem is, none of them talk. Even tried the talking one with the stripes, complete silence.
---
Awesome! Thanks for sharing!
---
Haha. I was seriously considering doing the same but it’s a big investment if she isn’t going to play. She’s too busy playing that Harry Potter game on her phone no that she discovered discord.
---
Okay I hear you. Might not be. 
---
I just remember this bug in many quests. But it never really did anything. It was just the waypoint for me always. 
---
Just to make sure. Have you checked out a video to see if you accidentally missed something along the way?
---
what would make the player base happy would not be maintainable
---
Maybe you should get another Xbox and then u guys can get each others back
---
Haha nice. And a lot of effort XD
---
the dad jokes are real.
---
If it bombs (no pun intended) that could* be bad for game production budget...?
---
I don't know any one that has got it.
---
But can he port Skyrim to Netflix
---
Yet there's still a text error and incorrect ammo designation in the terminal. So not only did it not get play tested, but it wasn't set up correctly on the function side either. They're inept.
---
Yeah people are petty lame if they need to steal your junk. Junk is that,junk it is easy to come by so don’t let it bother you or your wife lose it. A tip if you are just downed just leave the server asap before you die and you get to keep your junk. You might still lose it if you don’t leave in time but most times you won’t and will get to keep your junk.
---
Yeah don’t expect anyone to burn a stimpack on you but it’s also not unexpected depends on the players. Public teams are that public and people do their own thing, maybe join a discord team if you want help. 
---
I mean I play with friends and unless you playing next to each other, getting across the map to save you takes too long to save someone.
---
people like that are few and far between. 
---
I could whip her up a care package of junk and aid if she wants. Maybe a pipe rifle or something
---
Yeah I want the Secret Service skin just so it's hidden in the legendary scrip machine lol.
---
Should have been a Netflix thing cause how many people are gonna want to get another streaming subscription.
---
I... i didn't even know you can talk to the former raider.... its always been shoot on sight xD
---
Yea I’m hoping to eventually, I told her to just male a character on my account so she would have 1st and could take stims off my mule but she wouldn’t listen.
---
You the ufo guy at white springs?!
---
that happened to me, try to level up one more time. hit 101 and see if it unlocks properly
---
Hmmm I’m not sure then. I just know they did something to make you be able to toggle on and off. I don’t have the skin so I probably should let someone with first hand knowledge actually answer haha
---
are they going to rework it like they reworked the legacies?  oh wait...
---
Dude, you are awesome &lt;3 \^\^
---
As a former salesperson, your assessment sounds dead accurate.
---
Lol. That’s what I did starting out...and it’s what I still do...my husband quit playing Fallout (he said he’d pick it up again..lol)...and now I’m stuck playing all by my lonesome.  😝
---
For those that dont already have an Amazon Prime account, yeah...but I would of like it to be on Netflix just because they've had some good success
---
On PC-&gt; Place Cursor above the choices and use direction key to choose going from "Selling/Buying"-&gt;Ammunition Type-&gt;Ammunition. Keep the cursor where it is and just spam E/Enter/Whateveryouuse. The terminal will "memorize" the process and allows you too spam
---
But it ends in ten weeks and he is 1/3 of the way there
---
In a experiment to weaponize the Weather that's correct.
---
No its useless. Not only does it not give u a lot of ammo in return, itll take u hours to click the ui that many times. They probably gonna introduce a convert all option but only to fo1st members in the future. I can see no other reason for why they would make it this terrible right now
---
Mine said fortnite is gross and I don’t know why that the first thing that popped into her head, even if she doesn’t play fallout she has games she likes on Xbox so it won’t be a waste plus I have my pc and I had a laptop for a while where we played warframe together
---
If I knew for sure the non voiced one was going to actually work correctly I would buy it.  The voice was "fun" the first time I came across someone with the armor.  Stopped being "fun" immediately after the first time.  Cool looking skin though.
---
Ahhh, that worked for you?
---
Hmm very weird. If I was you, I would be sure not to craft any of them. Just in case they should ever do something to players they thought exploited their way to those rewards.
---
You spout words of Blasphemy
---
Well you know what i mean like bob the actor will fast travel to merry poopins,but he will be stuck in infinite ad loading screen then we have to wait for next episode to see it fixed!Then when they fix the infinite ad loading screen he will be killed by a mole rat,and he will be only able to respawn to episode 1 cause the series think he is overweight;) Jokes aside i am really looking forward to it!
---
Above 100 Mbps internet on ps4 and its terrible.
---
I love the Walking Dead too! I'm so sad they had to delay the season finale lol. Although I hope that it isnt like the Walking Dead where they are just trying to survive, hopefully something more along the lines of 2 or NV where society has rebuilt to an extent. Although this being Bethesda, the protagonist will probably be a member of the Brotherhood of Steel in a wasteland like 3 or 4, which also works imo since in that case the protagonist wont need to focus on survival.
---
You'r right! The old recipe is so much better! But they  are a little bit stale at this point and I ate so much that I'm full.
---
It could have been patched recently. if not it could have fallen victim to whatever glitch is causing 3 stars to drop 1 star items. Iv had a few legendary enemies recently not drop anything at all.
---
South of Hemlock Holes is a respawning Grafton Monster.  It's either the Monster or Super Mutants.  It's about a 20 minute respawn timer.  Also Grafton Day parade.
---
She is doing a melee build or at least that what I’m helping her with due to she can’t aim worth a damn lol
---
I have seen them in a vendor a few times.
---
If you remove the pillar, you can never move the camp.
---
If you leave the pillar, you can move the camp, and create a stairwell blueprint.
---
I feel like my wife will out play me anyway so it will end the same
---
Wendigos are your friend! Easy to find them
---
To bad he can’t do it now 🤷‍♂️
---
I am always near the limit for caps so 40 caps to fast travel is not much
---
yep, but that was 4 months ago
---
I think the only thing needed is to remove the limit for what we can have. I think thats the only way we can get the idea that people are saying that we should just be able to convert all we have all at once. I’m not sure what would be needed on the code in’s game design side but it seams like a full over haul since not all bullets are the same amount. I personal don’t see the need to change anything
---
back when i was melee all i could do was run around dodging their screams and stuff until they decided to land. 
---
And then it was a couple of swift bonks on their noggin and it was game over, man
---
I have a proposal to make. I have a character that can build almost everything in the game (mats allowing) and a load of low level legendaries that carried me through to level 50. If you’re on Xbox you two, I can mod any guns you’re after (don’t have makeshift warrior so I can’t do melee weapons) and I can also give mats and build stuff in your camps.
---
*Saw pretty much the first sentence. Add me at BlackClock69#660
---
Honestly. The only reason it passed is cuz it didn't go through PTS. Otherwise we wouldn't have this problem. They oughta release them for a limited time through the PTS since the Atom shop isn't available anyway
---
oh damn really, good job! I thought it was just an official piece haha
---
Thanks, I feared as much.
---
Serious question. So why do you want to progress if you dont want to be playing the game? 
---
Like you just want the content it has?
---
Damn a missed opportunity for sure... Thanks for letting me know
---
I feel like i've had more 3* from there than anywhere else
---
I think its better because you dont have to follow stupid robots and protect them and it's much faster. And even afk ppl can contribute when they play the drums or turning the fire pit thingy 😅
---
yup, concentrated fire and gun fu are awesome together
---
He dropped the mic with that story🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I completed the weekly ones in a few hours. Imo they are the ones worth doing. They dont take too much time for an experienced player and I dont have to log in every single day for the dailys
---
Well i could make a couple of melee weapons and some armour.
---
I think that a terminal could work if it was like the ammo press from the Pitt but expanded to take energy weapon ammo as well. Another thing that I would like is if they made the fusion core recharger mod from Fallout 4 into something that was added here.
---
afaik the "welcome mats" were disabled because they were abused.
---
True, but I mean double Score on the Weekly for only a weekend wouldnt make much sense lol :P
---
It would be nice if the repeatable counted as well, but not a big deal to me, double XP weekend will basically replace that.
---
A lot of my friends plan to get the game soon and I plan to make new characters and play with them but in the meantime, I’m not having fun. Especially when I just got Control and other games which I want to play, though I can’t if I’m filling  my free time just grinding
---
Got 2 Weeklies completed today as well without Score being awarded. I think it may have something to do with the challenge requiring you to finish X tasks (Today the build up camp and Killing Robots Challenges failed to award Score) from a list of X+ a few more? Maybe It doesnt count because not all tasks are complete?
---
I just sever hopped the Grafton monster next to Charleston Station. It's only a level five and a super quick run to get to.
---
Yeah, given Todd, I'm certain the BOS will play a pivotal role in the storyline. I'm down for that though, I love the BOS lol
---
Last thing I want to do is put more hours into this but it will be faster than the support ticket I’m sure.
---
It just wasnt progressing even when i learned the password. I hard restarted again and got it to work this time
---
Sorry you guys can’t play together! Hopefully in the future but have fun and wave if you see me out there
---
Lots of people have prime.
---
gun fu rules. i usually run that with adrenaline and concentrated fire and it does major work for sure. nice to switch things up sometimes
---
If you have some unwanted legendary melee weapons or stimpacks( because she always uses them all) that would help her out a ton, I can’t trade with her
---
Not everybody
---
Also keep in mind the changes to carnivore/herbivore
---
I use those 2 perks plus shotgunner and skeet shooter and I literally kill everything in like 2 hits
---
Hooray! Let the PC players just type the damn numbers in already.
---
If you could make her some good armor that would be great, I would if I could
---
Cool. Praise for screwing up? They still bring you guys crap ideas in the first place because you lot buy every piece of garbage they offer regardless of how much they nickel and dime you.
---
If you are a hoarder in these games you might want to subscribe to Fallout 1st...you get unlimited junk storage in a special storage container.
---
SCREW THE RULES! I HAVE MONEY!!!
---
Yeah the only logic I can come up with behind the increasing number of time gated functions in this game is they might be trying to prevent gaming addiction lawsuits like the one against Fortnite right now.
---
Visited a camp 2 days ago. I won't name the owner but the only way to get to the area where his sale items were was via a single width corridor. There was a trap that infected and killed you immediately. I went back and let him know his actions were not acceptable. He shrugged as I watched about 6 others die. I don't use a headset so couldn't warn them.
---
A fast travel map would help players set traps
---
Alrighty, I’ll want her to hold some fluxes from my alt though. I’ll give her the stuff I used to get me up to level 50 minus the Stealth suit (non transferable) and the fluxes, then get on my main and do the building. Are either of you on now? If you don’t have a decontamination shower I’ll build you one as well
---
I think you problem us another thing... Its a skin, not a New power armor...
---
I'm confused
---
Okay great to hear. 
---
Have fun
---
it's in the Road map.
---
That’s fine I got you ill explain it to her
---
Okay then. GT 
---
and what level is she?
---
I'm saving my lunch box exp bonus for this
---
Like arms and legs?
---
She is level 12 and her gt is Ruvarcia
---
He could only be contained for about a day before he was back to his shenanigans.
---
You should tell them while the game occasionally goes on sale it is half off right now. That and it will help them with the pass if they're also interested in getting it and they don't want to pay to progress it. If they start a month later or so their chances of completing it all the way without paying go down to about 0.
---
Ability to pay for progress coming in two weeks as others have said. 
---
Good luck but its gonna be best to grind for an hour or two at least for the daily score.
---
Why? Because the other end game content for the actual game is daily grinding for scrip and gold.
---
The event is coming soon, the news post today had a date
---
That would be amazing. I'll also agree, Appalachia is honestly beautiful and I'd love a single player version I must say.
---
It will be bugged, no thanks.
---
Score is not awarded in any event. Anyone who has said that has misinterpreted where they are getting score from.
---
They have confirmed the “completed events for score” means completing challenges which INCLUDES doing events or public events.
---
https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1278728339780485120?s=19
---
This is the way
---
I assume it hasn't been mentioned because it's so obvious but sleep in your bed while having a companion at camp for 10%xp. Also mothman event.
---
That’s nice of you
---
Was excited till I saw it was by the folks that made westworld. That show spiraled into a dumpster fire spectacularly after its first season. Expect any fallout series by them to be filled with pretty scenes that make no narrative sense. Expect what plot there is to be savagely activist with incompetent dudes being dissed by omnipotent women and fight scenes with beauty queens flailing at very very compliant stuntmen. It’s gonna suck.
---
GT is rammadeus. I'll find her once i've whipped some stuff up
---
This is the thing with fallout 76, if you expect a single player game that you can "finish" this game is alright until that point. But as soon as your done you realize you don't want to leave but everything offered for after you finish the main story is actually really bad but if you want those cool things like gold buillon, new legendarys you need to log in everyday after theres no longer anything to do and this is what sucks about this game. And when they add stuff it quickly becomes pointless because they cant fix dupes so instead of grinding something you can get it for a couple thausand caps.
---
Colossal Event getting pushed back over a month (maybe 2) and legendary perks won’t be released until October... well that really sucks.
---
Yeah, but wouldn't you prefer them to actually put some effort in and spent 10 minutes testing the shit they make or at least hire someone who actually gives a shit / is semi-competent? Then you wouldn't need to respond to community complaint
---
They’ve already announced they are reworking the ammo converter.
---
Tbh gold bullion and faction rep grinding killed it for me. I just wish there were more exactly and creative ways to get the reputation at least. But I’ll probably just pay up until the hunting rifle skin cause that’s about all I want though that is a horrible mindset to have when dealing with Bethesda
---
I just take a few pop shots and wait while crouch. They usually land right in front nose to nose. Well only for a split DCG second.
---
Meat Week is back as well, I was hoping they were going to bring it back again this summer. I still don’t have most of the rewards for it because people were so bad at completing it the first time lmao.
---
She is doing back on the beat event, so you got time
---
Which brings up the other absurd part of it. This vital device, now destined to consume future development and design resources, is only going to be available to players who are here in season 1?
---
You can go to the flooded train yard too
---
It is nowhere near as bad as all the complaining suggests.
---
At this point I’m just glad I got an ammo converter, rather than leaving bags 5mm ammo all over West Virginia.
---
This may apply to the levels and not the total xp.
---
Is the game board tied to character or to account?  
---
If it is account can't you make a toon, have a friend power level you with the swimming get like 15 levels, delete that toon (optional), make new one, repeat.
---
i had this happen to me earlier too, where the pylon doesnt light up and stuff but i spam clicked the action button even though there was no option and it worked
---
PTS is their QA
---
Yeah I know, it’s just a paint but it’s still nowhere to be found.
---
I only use primed ammo so it is pretty useless to me anyways...
---
Doesn't surprise me.
---
I played this game from beta till a year after. Once the pay to do shit stuff came out I was out.
---
Quality of life improvements by paying when it should have been in the game, that's some bullshit. The game was broken half the time. They should have made up for that.
---
Very dissapointed I couldn't even get into wastelanders bc of it too.
---
Game left a bad taste in my mouth from all the shit they did.
---
i see then please convert 3 000 of any kind of ammo and tell me how long it takes for u to do it
---
I tried that, but it didn't end up working. 
---
Glad you managed to get through though!
---
Incorrect information on the website...of course there is, when isn’t there incorrect or lies on the website...
---
If they don't match your build, then nah there's not much point in keeping them.
---
Any 'god roll' legendaries you might get will be better than any of the default unique items.
---
Also there's usually a wendigo at the Whitespring golf shop
---
Explosive shotguns, and enforcer Rank 3. Just a few taps will clip her wings and drop her to the ground.. also useful for big creatures,, death claws, sheepsquach, behemoths. Just fire it at the ground and it will break its legs. The explosive legendary prefix gives more chances for it to proc but its not needed. Honestly a bog standard auto combat shot gun will do the job just fine, you're not using it for damage, you're using it to bust some knee caps... or wing... caps...
---
Really makes you wonder the system if they didn't have a problem with the ammo converter.
---
Reward
---
I got bored a few weeks back n just farmed/build every T-51 part I could get my hands on and made an army of the buggers in nuka paint.. figure what the hell, may as well give them to folks xD at one point I had something like twenty seven full sets made up
---
Oh ok... That must be... Terrible... I too am grinding this... Im at 87... Took me a year to reach this.... To glitch at the end... My god...
---
Same.  I want the fuck out of that secret door fireplace
---
thanks, your imagery made me actually laugh out loud
---
Played since beta. Was hoping wastelanders would save it but the content was as deep as a puddle. Cancelled 1st and not played in over 3 weeks. Endless button clicking doing the same objective and dailies time after time after time for what..........a new skin! Whoopee do!! This isn't fallout and it sure isn't fun (not for me anyway)
---
Yeah. Pretty disappointing.
---
Altho i will say it was weird, i respawned with the pylon aggro so its probably a bug
---
Every part. Showed up on the torso, the helmet, both arms and legs.
---
It takes the mod slot, gives you no jetpack, and repaints the correspondent limb in camo.
---
From what I've noticed, it's usually the veterans tend to be a lot nicer(or at least just don't care). There have been plenty of times where I've died and it's usually the players 60ish and under that have immediately looted my junk the moment I died. Then there are players who just randomly try to give me loot, whether it's gear, consumables, junk, or so forth. Like other's have said, there are both good and bad players. I would help out but sadly I am on ps4 so most I could probably offer or advice at this point.
---
We will my dude, hopefully soon me and her will be a team, her wondering around and me instant killing everything to keep her alive
---
Hey its your money. Youre free to spend it how you like. I was just curious why someone would if it sounds like youre already bored/over the game.
---
\*Encryptid
---
You're ruining the pun.
---
Yes! I was dissapointed I couldn't wear the outfit I bought at the atom shop with this.
---
The new updated Clean interface version of the Ammo Converter will only cost 1000 Atoms in the Atom shop. /s
---
If they played the game they would have known how bad it is
---
Is it the same for dailies not completing? For example one of the dailies today is to kill 3 cryptids, I killed 2 snallygasters and a grafton monster but it’s saying I only have killed 1/3 cryptids. (Side note: I may have gotten the score for it but I was fighting the SBQ so I may not have noticed it appear)
---
Your good my dude I just kinda went on a rant because it pissed me off, I gave the dude firm thumbs down so he knows what he did.
---
He is probably not a hacker a lot of higher level players have way too many blueprints.
---
You can pretty much get them anywhere daily missions, events, workshop defense, and even just finding them in the world. 
---
They take up space and people dont want the hassle of trying to sell them.
---
The Fixer is the only one you can craft, the rest are rewards with legendary effects.
---
Noice! Should make up for me missing all the dailies this 4th of July weekend. Hopefully I can make 100 without spending atoms.
---
I'm glad they're addressing it. I feel bad for the programmers with all the flak they get. It's not really their fault.
---
This is the way.
---
While I sympathize with the few people that legitimately obtained them, I don't think it's worth leaving the majority of legacy weapons in the game. I say this as the owner of a couple less valuable ones. 
---
Most of the PvP nightmare legacies are the product of exploits and promote an underground real money market that encourages further exploits leading to more problems with the game. Not only that but they have soured PvP for many players and are a big part of why it has become so unpopular. 
---
Bethesda could always try to compensate players that had these items removed so that the few players that legitimately obtained them aren't totally screwed and the players that traded an arm and a leg for one have less to complain about. 
---
If Bethesda fixes the effects and makes them drop again then there would be no issue in keeping them in, but unless they are nerfed into near uselessness they'll just provide too much of a competitive advantage against players who missed out on one of these weapons legitimately and don't want to support cheaters and a black market.
---
Not a case of forgetting, some people just don't cere to, as it doesn't directly benefit them.
---
Barbarian is a good perk to share to low levels btw.
---
Yeah this happens unfortunately with some of the rewards. Happened to me twice so far and both with stuff I really wanted. Had to grind one or two more levels, but it all eventually unlocked.
---
Not a team player myself, but I did enjoy the ease of joining and starting a team with the public team system. Much better than the old system. Plus being on a team will give you rewards for events and quests that your teammates do without you.
---
I hate to say it but this is what you can expect from Bethesda. Too many years they counted on the modding community to fix there broken code. Now that they are left to do it, well...
---
ask her to head the station she's near. And i'll dump the stuff in a suitcase.
---
Ok it wasn’t as bad as expected
---
Yes. They also give a much more detailed menu when you select them on the map.
---
Not surprising tbh, it’s probably messed up for the other armors as well
---
Thanks hon ❤️
---
It better have Ron Perlman in it, that's all I'm gonna say.
---
sold my acc yesterday so pog no more worries about a broke shitty game
---
Not sure how to trigger it, but I did this event earlier this week on PS4.
---
Slug buster is surprisingly awesome, dont chuck it.
---
Thanks a lot bud, despite me disabling mods the bz was still in my folder and fucking things up this fixed it for me
---
I've had mixed results with it working and not working
---
Just pops up randomly, I’ve only ever seen it in the cranberry bog though. Also to answer your question I’ve done it 3 times since Patch 20 came out
---
Lol thank you. I’ve made abunch of Free States posters and am glad a lot of them pop up when looking up “Fallout propaganda posters”
---
She is headed there
---
I bet he would have tried if it wasn't so like Game of Thrones
---
Wait, what?
---
No. You can find them later at a player vendor if you miss them.
---
Rested/Well-Rested/Lover's Embrace all give 5% XP, differing only in duration (1hr/2hr/3hr). Mothman also gives 5%. And yes, both will stack with the setup I mentioned, with the caveat that you can't keep popping a Mothman bonus every hour, and if you die the rested bonus disappears so you have to find a new bed.
---
I do agree the thing isn't that bad good idea but it was executed terribly. Its hard to try to sell 12-20 bullets at a times when you could have between 3000-6000 and some players are even trying to sell around 10000 rounds. Its mostly only useful for explosives at the moment like 40 mm grenade rounds, missiles, and mini nukes.
---
That’s odd that one I lost a while ago and it’s back in the store for me!
---
Here’s hoping that the person re-working it knows what the hell they’re doing. 🤞🏼
---
add crossplay
---
I see a new hype meter on my heads up display! And the needle is beginning to move!
---
I get the feeling. I get annoyed when players immediately go for my loot like buzzards. It's like they have no consideration of others, think only for themselves, and think that just because they can and there's "no rule" against it, then it's okay. Some people are just lacking in the moral department.
---
Then on the other hand, screwing over new players, kids, and such, then they're just garbage. It's as simple as that.(only exception I really see though is if the person is an asshole and had karma coming back their way lol)
---
Wait what I didn’t think that one could be removed since it’s a default!?
---
ok but what about adrenaline
---
Yea I feel the same
---
That worked for me with a reward from around lvl.40 a while ago so it might work on lvl.100 too
---
In other news i revived someone at the end of scorched earth. Died while reviving them and then they stole my flux reward.
---
Twice that's happened now.
---
Seasons werent in PTS, so the ammo converter probably had literally 0 testing
---
Same for me.
---
That’s never been a problem for me. I learned early on to only collect the ammo I use the most. And if I decide to use a gun with ammo I don’t have, then it’s pretty easy to collect them from boxes, especially with Scrounger.
---
Green uniform can be sold for about 4-5k if she wants funds
---
Do you have a link to this? It’s not that I don’t believe you I just want to make sure so if I buy the Tricentennial pack that I WILL get it
---
Then... don’t do it?
---
10k XP is not hard to get so you only need 25k XP to equal NW time.
---
Just because there is a box to check doesn’t mean you have to check it, especially when there is an infinite box that is simply gain xp.
---
Can F76 Project Lead also tell us when the damn fast travel bug will be fixed..?
---
Lovely.
---
My mistake on well rested. I just noticed though that I have a very well rested perk currently. Any idea how I got it? Its a massive boost of 75% https://imgur.com/DzpxBdW.jpg
---
Gun Fu. I share it and nobody complained yet.
---
Yea that’s fucked up, you made a pregnant woman very happy in the end tho so good on you
---
yea true, but he was only level like, 120 or so, so he must have insanely high luck if he just gives away plasma grenade plans
---
Restart Xbox
---
Are you seriously complaining about surviving 30 min?? It takes two-three matches tops..
---
13 for the moment , The nuclear winter ones I was lucky Right in the middle of the shrinking zone. time enough to listen to a podcast or read some articles while im camping in a bush. My wife asked me what I was doing lol Gaming honey ... but you don’t do anything. Yeah its a hide and seek game im hiding ;-)
---
MEAT WEEEEEEEEEK!!!!!!!!! I love it.
---
There is a mod for the gauss weapons the viscous receiver that improves critical damage and hip fire accuracy.
---
Why would that be a mod combo when refined receivers do they exact same thing.
---
They changed this from fallout 4 to be more important and noticeable that it ever was. You can find posts from 2019 confirming it which is probably when they changed it. They further refined it in wastelanders to include accuracy even more. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ac7ccw/twoshot_gun_missing_at_95_try_increasing_hip_fire/
---
I could find more posts but there everywhere
---
I just hope the one for the SS is not same, but my hopes are always smashed when they concern Beth :/
---
That's weird because I actually noticed opposite behavior since the whole public teams thing. I did Encrypted with one yesterday and my teammates were actually reviving each other, including me, which rarely happens. I was hopeful it would bring people together a bit more but ugh guess not.
---
As someone else said, most of the time it's just sweaty mid-levels being greedy. The last time I took someone's junk was like 200+ levels ago and in Survival mode, I figured it was fair game for him coming to hunt me down like a moron with 100 lbs of junk on him. 
---
That said, it's happened to all of us one time or another. It's better with public events but I'm still ultra paranoid about getting robbed of my flux after an SBQ, even knowing they changed it so it just disappears if you die after the fight. As I'm sure you know being a player yourself, on the whole we have a pretty decent community and very few scrubs running around taking from vulnerable low levels.
---
it should be, but it wont unfortunately
---
Generals steakhouse, Sunday brothers, vault 94, farm in forest SW of hemlock holes (forget the name) have varying blossoms.  May be tato in some of them, however.
---
Will I get another beer stein out of it?
---
Colossal problem delayed till august and legendary perks delayed till September when they were both supposed to come out in patch 20 originally, lel 
---
They’d better be good
---
really? But angry turtle said flooded trainyard is a guaranteed spawn for snallies :(
---
Despite the fact I play Warzone, Fortnite, Apex (one of the most free and fluid mechanics) but okay
---
I save the mirv fatman (daisy cutter?) so that when I do the pioneer quest that has modify a fatman I can strip out the mirv to make it a regular fatman and get credit for "modifying" it. Then I sell it for scrip.
---
I saw it just a few minutes ago - just before my game crashed for the second time in an hour. Randomly appears across the bog.
---
Yeah your probably right I do do that often but I was kinda a little annoyed when I wrote that post to put it mildly.
---
I'm not entirely sure but I think that they are supposed to be in the aid menu.
---
Should be in the aid section that’s where I found mine
---
10, but I dont get a lot of play time.
---
Yea if very few that are like that aside from sbq where you will always get robbed
---
I'd actually like to see the math showing that the approximate 8% exp boost to everything works out to more exp than getting an extra 100% for completing events. I'd imagine a lot has to do what events you choose to run and your play-style. It seems like a lot of effort to figure out though with so many variables.
---
From time to time you can find good stuff.  I found the croc backpack for 1k caps and the treasure hunter outfit plan for 120 caps.
---
I just saw one today actually!
---
Always happy to help people out
---
Should’ve told him how much it’s worth and gave it back to him.
---
She lost it from the emote wheel and disappeared from the atom shop aswell
---
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
---
The hat is included yes.
---
Southwest of the drop site c-2 spawn location.
---
I saw one last night doing a sqb event
---
Apparently it's a reward from one of the lunchboxes. Probably one opened by a teammate. Personally, I haven't even claimed those; I've yet to decide whether my heavy main or my snipey alt will get those boxes.
---
On the road somewhere near Thunder Mountain, and also a regular at SBQ parties. Pretty rare elsewhere.
---
It's been like that since before the latest patch. Sometimes the thing you need is in the ground/invisible and can't be picked up, more infuriating is when you can SEE it right there and still can't interact with it.
---
they spawn at SBQ often and also east of bootleggers shack is a spawn. 
---
LOVE the design of them tbh. Just a bit annoyed you cannot climb on top of their corpse.
---
There aren't any random encounters for them I don't think but there are set spawns for them, one is on the elevated road next to Thunder Mountain power plant. In fact on that main road is a few set spots, there is one I know of in the bog but I only know it off sight. They always spawn curled up in their truck shell so its easy to miss them if you aren't spamming vats like I do lol.
---
Same troubles here
---
I'd settle for a buff to cushioned legs. Goat Legs 2 and a pair of cushioned legs should easily equal fall damage immunity, but cushioned is completely worthless right now.
---
Honestly you might just be exploring a lot less compared to when you first started, I find myself stuck in gameplay loops doin the same shit every day in 76 without even doing much exploration because I have most of the fast travel points it just makes more sense to fast travel for me lol
---
Whats going to suck is when we have to kill x players or monsters and have to do more than Bush wookie. At least for stims you can spawn by the fire loot a few stims amd finish it
---
Yeah I actually completed the Build Up a Camp challenge and it didnt give me a notification that said I completed it but I look into my challenges and it says competed without it giving me my SCORE
---
We need more detail on why you can’t, because if it’s simply them saying “you can’t cancel the membership” then take legal action. If it’s bugged, then send them an email about it.
---
" Sorry it didn't live up to the hype..."
---
Wow, understatement of the year. It was outright disrespectful and could only have been that bad because they planned it that way.
---
Being an OG fallout 76 player on Xbox, I still can’t get over how stoked I am about how much effort, time, and content is being put into this game.  In my opinion, ever since wastelanders, they fixed the game 110%.
---
Just try to get back into stealth between waves and aim for thrusters if your on ps4 I'd run it with you if you want.
---
And miss out on a rare weapon the guy clearly didn't even want since he was selling it?
---
In a non-microtransaction world...sure. Completely unrealistic unfortunately in today’s gaming world.
---
Why is your perception more or less important than any others? 
---
I would be willing to bet I've spent more hours in game and more money on it than a great majority and its not like I am special boi who you should listen to because of that. But when I go to do my thing and find an endless stream of bugs, broken promises, no communication or followup, AND a grind that would give an officer worker carpal tunnel then I start to get frustrated.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
You can't even complete the first season in 76 in 10 weeks without buying the last 10 levels with atoms
---
I saw something in the most recent inside the vault mentioning a bonus score event coming, does anyone know how much bonus score there will be available through that?
---
Some people don’t care about stuff that isn’t in their build. I only really keep stuff to sell that I see people talk about and it’s pretty rare that anyone buys something that’s not flux or lead scrap. Unless you basically give crap away people don’t buy it.
---
aid tab. should have a little atoms symbol by it.
---
No, actually. I’d prefer them to focus more on responding to community feedback.
---
Nice 😆👌
---
Pick one, or start your own, join, get your bonus, and then never speak to or even see each other for however long you stay on the server while you all run off and do your own thing. That's been my experience anyway.
---
I've been in a couple Event teams where my team is hitting all the publics and others where we do one together and then I never see them again. It's whatever, just jump in and give it a try!
---
It only takes a few minutes to complete so chances are somebody is doing it when it pops up and you're missing it. I had one the other day by the sub station near watoga so it spawned deathclaws which was pretty cool.
---
No I was watching it. Second supply package didn’t unlock either. Never appeared in my inventory.
---
literally all you have to do is sit in a bush for maybe 2 rounds. its literally the easiest possible NW challenge.
---
You and me both in that regard, only some days i actually can play for a little while 😀
---
And you thought you'd come on here and brag about it?
---
SMH!
---
I share cannibal.
---
When I go to subscriptions in Xbox, it isn’t there. I got charged for it yesterday. Maybe it’s canceled right now someway but I want to be sure
---
Apparently it goes away after some time, other than that it's fucked

Duh. If you accidentally sold something and didn’t know the worth, wouldn’t you want it back ? 🤔 we’re a good community bruh we help each other out. It’s bad enough all the other stuff we gotta deal with.
---
Who was this fucktwat? DM me her screen name
---
I got a nocturnal SS + S Pipe wrench this morning.  Shame to use up my luck on the 2and and third stars for that trash.  Everytime a nocturnal rolling pin is dropped a dev gets his wings.
---
If I sold something without knowing it's worth first, that's my own fault
---
I hear you Philip Defranco

stramgles in numbres, eagle egg+8int, herd mendaliti +3 int, complete uny set, +15 int, hervivore + chambery relish 25% exp,  brain fogus soup +5 int, sleept in your camp +5% exp , leader +5 exp if you have, +4 int for 4 member construccion team....go to farm super mutant and get 500 experience for each kill
---
Get chem backpack mod from raiders, saving 3 str points is neat, that way you can get all other weight reduce perks like heavy guns or explosives. And you can use ionized meat and flux as food and water, they always weight 0.2
---
Another ninja edit, get second copy of fallout, its 20$ on steam ATM till 9 of July,  im not gonna pay for sub in the current state, but having mule is so good and you can transfer your items between characters. I had to install steam version tho, with bethesda installed first
---
character steps/leans forward slightly and salutes with 2 fingers for like 2 seconds. it has a little musical ditty that plays as well.
---
If you side with the raiders you literally bring a kid with you.
---
150 atoms per rank. Without bundle discounts I think that’s like $1.50 per rank.
---
Maybe add a favourites option?
---
I have gave you an upvote it's a great idea for the guys starting but what about the advanced adventure kit for us high level players maybe a furious cryolator , a few thousand rounds of ultracite ammo  for the weapon of our choice, a few nuclear keycards and a couple of recall cards too.👌
---
Shhhhhh!
---
(And thank you!)
---
That kid isn’t a newborn. And anyway, the typical human gestation period is nine months, not six.
---
sell em or scrip em if you dont want them, worst case you have to redo the quest on an alt to get it again.
---
all quest reward weapons are static drops so they will always be the same roll. so no RNG.
---
that's a bug with two shot, not intended mechanics. Ballistic weapons with terrible accuracy even with twisted muscle mutation will hit every time with 95% hit chance
---
This is the best way to get lots of screws in a short time.
---
Look up angry turtles YouTube video on magic weapons. Unfortunately it is a bug.

“Scoot”. Idk why but that made me chuckle.
---
took me 2 days to convert about 200k ammo, and NOW there going to fix it ......
---
The model change paints work on all PA.
---
No. It’s not, values change constantly. And well over half the players in f76 on console don’t use reddit. Ignorance isn’t a choice 😂
---
I have the same thing, I just put the dark matter jet pack on.
---
Somewhere on Bethesda's website is a gif of it. 
---
I don't know where it is but if you...
---
Hold on.
---
Ok here's the link
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4e3tPL9rI61gwsAaBjvDU8/ato...
---
Guy buys item from player proceeds to think their generosity is stupidity and posts to Reddit well played sir.
---
All hail Mothman
---
Maybe you can remove the door from the cabin and it might work
---
They're choosing not to use Reddit so they are choosing ignorance
---
Also a couple plants outside the elevator after you come out of belly of the beast
---
I was in two SBQ fights and killed another SB and got the challenge to pop
---
Does that factor in the atoms you get as rewards at certain ranks?
---
Just need some brahmin milk. It’ll sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.
---
Can't remember are pistols AGI or PER? I'm thinking AGI as I've got so many stealth perks I couldn't use the pistols ones... Kinda sucks as it'd be a fun build.
---
You might have to contact Microsoft directly about that man, either them or Bethesda.
---
And not everybody has Netflix either
---
Appreciate the responses all, Im gonna have to look harder
---
Ive just done daily/weekly score challenges and im at rank 13. Shouldnt be too much of a grind if ill be at rank 30-40 in one week
---
&gt; what about the menus that haven’t worked properly in months? 
---
What about every menu in the entire game?
---
Jeff Gardiner has said on twitter they are gonna change it to an easier interface so we will see what they do to it maybe next year 🙈
---
You obviously don’t know how a free market works, instead of giving real world examples, I’ll give you something we can relate on; an economy in a video game, EFT is a great example of this. They have a fully player driven economy referred to as the “Flee market” those players who grind hard and suffer on that game to reach the level requirements acquire the “end game gear” that they deserved. and since they EARNED those items they determine a base market price since the  They got it first, but guess what if there price base price doesn’t sell? They will adjust their sale price to match supply and demand. And as time proceeds in the game more and more players will acquire that “end game gear” and in turn prices will stabilize to something reasonable. God roll weapons in fallout will have a stabilized price with players that are reasonable. Those who overprice things will never sell anything. THERE IS NO GRIND IN THIS GAME it’s a daily check list of minute tasks and offer no satisfaction whatsoever. if there was a GRIND as you say. There would be no currency limits. So I can play all day and have something to strive for. Right now I play about two hours and I’m off because there is fuck all to do after I reach my limits and challenges completion.
---
Praise atom for that one
---
OK....whatever was clogging up the SCORE must have been dislodged. I went up 3 levels in about an hour. Yay. Now I get to fight with the ammo converter. 😃
---
I am solo and I like public teams so far because I can still be solo while having beneficial perks and map locations to travel for free.  I have only been on event teams thus far.  The extra xp is nice.
---
I think I came upon this with a lvl 582.  Wont say what it is but I leveled up alot.
---
It's a timer of sorts.. Point is to beat that to the end
---
Ok looking good I bought the let's hunt emote thinking it was unique but it's not so I wanted to make sure thx for the help
---
Yeah, but I want to keep the T-65 profile
---
As far as I know, that piece is the timer representing how long the season has left. When it reaches the end, the season ends too. Your goal is to pass it and reach the end before it does (ie complete every rank). I dont think anything happens if you pass it though.
---
Ah like a pacer? So being behind it means you won't make it to 100?
---
From what I know I dont think that selling an extremely rare legacy item for 1,000 caps is smart. Or generous. I think its either stupid or the sellers lack of knowledge about the item. If hes being generous and selling that for that cheap than I guess I'm wrong.
---
Nah, not at all. People who don’t use reddit don’t know what’s on reddit. When I first started reddit I didn’t know there was f76 trading subs or any other trading subs for other games I play. I was ignorant, and wasn’t my choice.
---
Lol comments like this are part of the problem with misinformation.
---
Heads up for the future, read the flavor text u derneath the icon
---
Gives u a pa paint, armor skin, under armor skin, couple flags, an icon, and a .50 cal skin
---
Sorry? I guess...
---
Native American lembas bread.
---
That’s really odd... no doubt it will pop back up later in the year unexpectedly
---
Ah ok well at least it serves a purpose! Thank you that's a good thing to know. Gives a good benchmark.
---
Correct
---
I guess so. Although it had a massive headstart so it will.move slower than you should/could
---
Personally, I scrip everything I am not actually using....including Bloodied weapons and unyielding armor.
---
Master Shake said they make those in a vault over in Tannsylvania....
---
Been having errors in general. Some challenges ending early at 2 or 3/5, getting new challenges appearing once original ones are cleared (not sure if that’s supposed to happen but since they are DAILY my guess would be NOT). To my knowledge I haven’t missed any score but given how many challenges there are it’s possible I missed some and didn’t realize it.
---
I’m at the 8th tile on the board game, after completing nearly every challenge for yesterday, today, and most for the week. I’m curious to know how far everyone else has gotten.
---
Also did a quick bit of math, there’s around 90-something board game spaces to get to the last rewards.  Beth has stated several times challenge seasons would run for “10 weeks” which is 70 days. Which means we gotta average 2 spaces per day (or a little less) to clear the end without spending atoms.
---
Each space so far costs 1000 Score XP. I’m wondering now if that amount will got up once we get further along the board..
---
It's agility but stealth kind of sucks with pistols due to no silencers and low range.
---
You ever wanna higher level to run around with and do some of the harder events with my GT is Lindbloom826,
---
My first thought today was what are Cryptids. Then I was like wait Queen of the Hunt has one of those and I haven’t done it in two weeks might as well! Then I remembered it’s snallygashers.
---
Thank you.. well, the text in this case is not clear to me
---
Well I mean if that's what u do then u do u but u could sell some of that stuff if it's like you know, worth the money, but yeh I understand that.
---
Yeah we all know how this game goes by now lol
---
Misinformation? Watch juiceheads video, he calculated the total time it would take. https://youtu.be/OfvSJ-ZAamI
---
LOL, git gud.
---
I don't believe it's a bug since in wastelanders they made a staple for all weapons. 
---
Well it can with enough vats accuracy but some weopons have such poor hop fire accuracy it will still miss.
---
Bruh it legit says “bundle includes: ... “
---
Now they need a way to queue for a public team while not connected to a server.
---
So what you're saying is, to reach max level, all I need to do is go into the forest and kill boars?  
---
*"LIVE TO WIN"*
---
So your suggestion for a bug fix is to stop playing events?       
---
       
---
🤷‍♂️
---
Perfect ty!
---
Yes. I know that is a very real concern. I remember the holiday "emote" bundle. Fortunately I didn't buy it but I feel sorry for everyone who did.
---
You git gud, nerd
---
Every once in a while, I’ll trade for materials.
---
I have a Bloodied SMG I’ll trying to get rid of for some lead.
---
It’s the downside to being level 514....I literally have everything I could want.
---
Im a happier person now that ive stopped playing fo76. And im a long time fallout fan with a lvl 82 char on fo76. I cant express enough how its completely bethesdas fault i put their game down.
---
My solution would be more repeatable challenges for every play style or atleast 5 with some overlapping eachother. 
---
Another would be removing the 25 point increase per level 
---
And last one as a option would be going from 100 levels to 76 and get rid of the useless filler rewards (25 bullion lol)
---
This has become less of a game, and more of an experiment of Bethesda’s to encourage players to spend money. All decisions, even the ammo converter, are intentionaly designed and created in a way to encourage us to spend money.
---
I don’t buy it for a second that the ammo converter wasn’t meant to be clunky and awful to use. They want us to have to always pay money for convenience.
---
No name calling, LOL! It was so long ago, I can't remember.
---
But after the carnage, and me fast travelling away, then back in passive mode. I told them I hope they were proud pf themselves, and one click fixed my C.A.M.P.,After blocking them all on PSN. They all sounded like they couldn't have been over 18.
---
I really feel bad for the kids nowadays, because of all the social strife, they're growing up to be unempathetic and hateful. My daughter is 26, and I had many dealings with her school over social media, and bullying within their own school portal. That was 15 years ago, I'd hate to think how bad it's become by now...
---
A great example was when I brought the communist PA, saw the red eyes and thought yes!!
---
Then I saw the Eyes are yellow -.- so misleading
---
Wasn't Skyrim what that Witcher show was based on?
---
Esit: I guess I should have included a /s
---
Double XP lol. Soon everyone is gonna be level 800
---
I like bethesda I dont hate them but they make weird decisions
---
I'm thinking some players ended up just buying for scrip. That and probably because it was cheap.
---
I went back and read it and they either wanted them to give score and scrapped it or something because it does specifically state completing events gives you score and they’ve removed that wording on these new updates.
---
You can also turn in fuel but not be able to buy fuel, which is arguablely one of most annoying non ultracite ammos to craft
---
I’m pretty sure you can transfer saved data to the new consoles
---
Soooo whining sometimes works!
---
Or season-long challenges like kill 50 legendaries or 1000 enemies for thousands of Score
---
ROFLMAO!!! Me too!!!
---
I'm only level 189 and I'm on console. Apparently others say that the people on console that use reddit are ignorant and shouldnt use it. But. Yeh I'm always looking for bloodied weapons.
---
Yeah i saw the nuka shine PA paint in the shop didn't like it then saw someone running about in it I had to ask what it was cause they looked so different
---
Yup. That too!
---
SBQ almost every time
---
I’m just about at 15 - just need about 15k XP to go over the top.
---
Oof, fingers crossed I hope that works.
---
I've sold 'bloodied ffr rah rah rah' weapons for like 8k-10k instead of god awful amounts like I see some ppl wanting. I mean, I'm now buying Excavator and T60 mod plans I don't really want to lose caps and stay within 30k. 
---
I was able to nab my dream handmade for only 6k, so if I know a gun is perfect for a certain build I'll sell it at a budget price. I don't stock shit. OP you may have encountered someone who would rather someone just enjoy it and not bankrupt themselves getting it. 
---
I must be doing something right as I close my vendor all the time as it's emptied within the same session by customers. I'm happy, their happy! Plus if they use our gear correctly the next epic battle the guy beside you might be fighting a shit ton better thanks to your gear!
---
I've had a pretty killer auto-pistol build for a while now, nice to finally see some love for the semi-pistols.
---
The real reward is collecting his ball sack to put inside a display case.
---
Aid it reads “lunchbox” with the atoms shop symbol
---
I’m on console as well...some of the best trades I’ve ever made were on the marketplace.
---
What’s your strat homie?
---
Ah ok thanks I hope they don’t make us pay for the game again though
---
I had that happen to me once (Xbox) several months ago. 
---
FYI there is a new random spawn vendor that sells them now. I have seen her spawn three times in the small camp by the river north of Wayward near Slocum's Joe. 
---
Bought from her for like 650 three times now. 
---
GL!
---
Real question right here ^
---
I like to keep them just ‘cause I’m a collector, I’ll probably never any of them but I think in a future camp maybe I’ll display them all. I also have three of the Survival mode weapons that I don’t use but don’t want to sell/scrip.
---
it should work like inventory, select how many you want to exchange and directly exchange it, the less clicks the better
---
The weeklies help, but it’s going to slow down at some point.
---
There is a bug right now where T-65 can get a camo skin that enables jet pack boosting on any armor part for some reason. And the dark matter jet pack is also equipable to it rn as well. Can't say if this is for all PA's though.
---
Hmmmmmmm....I need to check that out.
---
Yeah I don't like they nerfed gauss weapon vats even if it was a bug but I like the hip fire focus I have been relying on.
---
True, but it states ot includes armor, not just the skin, color of the armor.. I know I am being naive and stupid. Thank you again
---
I would love to donate to good vendors who have cool houses or deals.
---
Y’all thieves downvoting are pussies 😂 I hope y’all shit get robbed too
---
I'm seeing that the NW challenges are more important than I thought. If you don't do them you need to average 36000xp per day (not that easy if you play solo or are low level), if you do them you only need 10600xp per day (which is really easy for anyone).
---
This doesn't take any newly added score sources or double XP/double score dates into consideration though, so hopefully those will help enough.
---
Had 2 spawn during a SBQ Event yesterday!
---
code it for them
---
😁😂
---
Just to clarify, never tried it myself but I did just now, even though it says it enables jet pack boosts on any body part, I don't think it does. Applied it to the head and while it gave it camo, it did not let me jet pack boost.
---
Yeah outside of the 10mm there isn't a silencer... Only just realised... wow that sucks.
---
Really pistols is crying out for a champion in the stealth category. Or alternatively.... Give us a Fallout equivalent of a D.Eagle. I'll put away stealth and create Meryl from MGS1 the day they put those in, and let rip.
---
Thank you so much for being proactive. Repetition can get so annoying but the time and effort you put in to make sure people know that an issue is on your page means so much to a lot of people (or at least it means a lot to me). Thank you again!
---
I hate jet packs...but how does it look?
---
When it happened to me it was server lag..
---
Yea mine is on the second part of the board already, and I’m still back at the clean sink.
---
Also over by the golf club workshop in the toxic Valley there is usually a Grafton Monster and 2 snarly  gasters
---
You do it through Bethesda.net I think
---
Sorry if it was mentioned already,  one area with three low level cryptids .  2 Grafton monster in Charleston. Trainyard and east of capital building. In-between them is  a low level snallygaster. Great for new players. 
---
I instead went for high level Wendigo. Whitesprings golf course,  Wendigo cave and Freddy house of fear. Hoping to run into legendary.
---
I didn't even mention when I had to ft back to base and repair my plasma gatling and whip up another 18 plasma cores.
---
The funniest thing is the post immediately after yours is someone asking about damage with junkies weapons.
---
I have heard there is a fallout tv series coming. Watch juiceheads video about it on Youtube. Dont know IF I would put my money in it this early tho
---
Atom shop never gives actual armor, just skins. Underarmor is the only exception
---
Bizarre thought process. You'd rather a problem be created and responded to rather than a problem never existing. Wonderful logic. Also, responding to community feedback isn't mutually exclusive to testing your software. Bravo
---
Imo not that bad, probably won't use because i need a jetpack and I can't use the skin without it removing it.
---
Double XP will improve the 10k XP challenge and make it faster and the double score will award double the daily score! I bet people are still moaning.
---
Still better than nothing.
---
Yep I also checked There. Nothing shows
---
True but you get few levels a day from dailies + repeatable xp one. I really havent played that much so for those that play several hours a day it should go quite fast.
---
cool, my psn is: Owl_No 
---
maybe The Hunts' Corp. and I, owner of raider vault 88, conduct some fine business thats beneficial to both of us
---
They award the points before they get completed sometimes.
---
My end game build is pistol plasma weapons. I do stupid amounts of damage and the weapon is expensive to maintain.
---
I played this way in fallout nv and TTW since they had many good pistol energy weapons in zeta mothership.
---
No its based of the witcher books
---
Huh, so it takes up the Mod slot?
---
Might have to craft a separate torso and see how it looks.
---
I looked at the board then worked on my camp all night instead. It's a choice. I also know when I'm beat. 
---
It ended for me after the sink and ammo converter. Which, asides from the worlds hatred of it, needed a more neutral colour scheme. I can't make that thing look good I'm sorry.
---
Not even Lenny Kravitz in Hunger Games could make this girl on fire. It's fuckin hideous.
---
People would complain if they release it in a broken state but also complain when it’s delayed to be reworked and made better.
---
Bruh
---
Put hand under butt , preferably while on toilet. Push, claim.
---
I hope so.
---
I’m not watching a video attempting to convince people something is almost impossible. 
---
How about instead of being a sheep do your own research and play the game. 
---
You can easily earn 1k score an hour just doing the repeatable. 
---
It’s sad the majority has gotten to a point where they feel like they are owed something but feel they should be allowed to do minimal effort to achieve it. 
---
Damn modern era and “everyone should get a trophy” mentality.
---
I was wary about adding herd mentality since the new text for it reads: "gain SPECIAL when you are *near* your team, and lose SPECIAL when you are not." As opposed to the old text which was "gain SPECIAL when *in* a team, and lose SPECIAL when you're not". 
---
If someone could show that the old wording still applies, I'd buy herd mentality even from the Whitespring bunker.
---
I don’t have a link, but it’s been mentioned on this a bit before when the patch dropped. As far as my personal knowledge goes, I have not seen that salute sold anywhere other than the pack. It’s also themed around the Patriotic Vault Boy who is the inspiration for all the Tricentennial pack cosmetics.
---
Edit: A quick google search brought me to [this link](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Shop/Emotes) which shows all the atomic shop emotes. The Tricentennial Salute (Patriotic Salute) is a Tricentennial Pack exclusive.
---
Imho I think the longest part is the nw grind ( 30 minutes played and the level up in NW took me a while) I needed a full bar of xp to level in NW for lvl 33. The 3 first aid stimpqcks was supper easy.
---
WOWWW I just started working on getting this perk lol damn
---
Why does it look like I'm not getting S.C.O.R.E. points in Fallout 76?
---
We are investigating an issue where some Weekly Challenges are granting their S.C.O.R.E. rewards at 3 of 5 completed instead of 5 of 5 completed. In these cases, you are still getting your S.C.O.R.E., but you have already received it by the time you have actually completed the Challenge, so it will not display an updated score when you complete 5/5 on the Challenge. This will be resolved in a future update. 
---
Please note that sometimes the UI may take a few moments to update. 
---
If you are experiencing an issue where you are not getting your S.C.O.R.E. points other than the above mentioned reasons, please submit a Feedback report here under "Quests". Make sure to include screenshot(s) or video of the S.C.O.R.E. and Challenge that you are reporting.
---
Yeah true that'd work. I kinda want a cowboy too, straight revolvers. No assless chaps however....
---
+8% for literally everything you do vs 100% just for event completion. Unless you are literally doing every single event that comes up you are most likely earning less xp per hour, especially because there are times where no events are up and event XP is based on what level those events are and there are a lot of low level events that give piss poor exp.
---
It's on sale on Steam for under $20. I'm going to pick it up. 
---
I think the thing that has pushed me over the line from "maybe" to "yes" is that I've been playing FO3 on Xbox 360 again after not having played it in years. And in doing that, I was reminded of all of the bugs: how it randomly hangs for brief periods or just completely locks up the console. I was also reminded of how I played through all of that way back when and just made sure to save frequently. Those bugs didn't prevent me from putting in well over 100 hours on my primary game save and buy all of the DLC for it. Same goes for FO4 which I played on PC. 
---
The other thing that did help was the release of the Wastelanders update. The game as it initially was released didn't really appeal to me. A game with NPCs, does, as I'm strictly a solo player, too.
---
Thanks, OP, for the reminder that no modern FO game has been glitch free. But, we've all still managed to sink hundreds of hours into these games and enjoyed them regardless.
---
You're a sheep yourself, if you don't analyze information from every source you're never gonna know the truth, I'm sure your life isn't so damn important that you can't spare 20 minutes to watch a video
---
You literally just spoiled his next big presentation.
---
From my understanding, at least the next Gen Xbox will be fully backwards compatible with current Gen titles (correct me if I'm wrong). Although that doesn't mean they won't try to pull a Skyrim and release an enhanced version that you need to pay for.
---
I think the only reason they have the nerve to set things up like this is because it's free rather than paid to play the "pass".
---
Dot they have a western outfit that is close.
---
I just checked general steak house there's only melon Blossoms, I said above that I'm looking for "MELON BLOOM" I cannot craft steeped melon bloom tea without it. Does Melon bloom even exist?
---
I did a double take when I first saw them.... I was like 'Um, no. You're not making me play Fallout Shelter as well.'
---
Thanks mate, I’ll keep a look out!
---
I don’t have to watch a video. I know how to play the game in a way to easily complete the challenges and earn large amounts of XP to rank up.
---
Getting really let down by legendary perks, it feels like theyve been dangling it in front of me by a stick for over a year now.
---
Cripes, I let the ui choose the price for most of what I sell. Most of it is shiat.
---
When its 3* then I double it, and when it's an epic combo, I go wide.
---
I guess youse guys would think I gave away a bloodied deathclaw with fss and +1 ag for 6000 but it didn't fit my build so I let it go.
---
Doesn’t seem to get ignored by devs? I cannot compute. Bethesda has devs for fallout76? Psh, I thought it was a group of monkeys or something. But seriously, do we play the same game? Obviously I enjoy fallout 76 but it comes at a steep price which is living in bug city, right next to glitch town and dupetopia. Devs ignore just about everything in the game that doesn’t directly affect how much money they make.
---
That’s what I’m worried about knowing Bethesda they’ll try to pull a Skyrim on us
---
Yeah but not assless... If there is that's for Fasnacht... And possibly 'meat week'...... ;) bahahahaha
---
Maybe it also got board of the grind.
---
Because outside of a couple small (though admittedly good) additions post launch, namely Biv and the Sheepsquatch chain, as well as the small solo content of Wastelanders (quite good) the game is in much the same state it launched in.
---
It's had some ups (stash space increase, some fixes) and lots of downs (old bugs returning numerous times or just never being fixed in the first place) but nothing new. Sure there are 4 new daily quests and 2 new events with Wastelanders, but they're basic fare.
---
So, how else to keep people engaged and playing? Drag out "progress" in the form of very low currency caps, slow reputation gain and now make the formerly bland daily challenges mandatory if you wish to play the legendary game thingy.
---
This is basic mobile game mentality. It's not about content or how you engage with it, but how long your eyeballs are glued to a screen.
---
Something along the lines of how "free" software that's not FOSS (free open source software) such as Windows 10 for just about anyone who had a previous version... if the product costs nothing, then YOU are the product. Though in this case, we have to pay for that too.
---
Very clever, Bethesda.
---
I think I’ve talked to him twice in the past and have never been able to bring up his dialogue again. Just brushed it off but the extra bullion would’ve helped me a few times. Xbox btw
---
Been wishing the same thing for my Ultracite PA, tbh.
---
You have to cancel from where ever you purchased it. Microsoft, Bethesda, steam, etc. it is confusing but is simple to do once you figure that out.
---
Do the wolf event northwest of vault 76 when it's up. It spawns 3 legendaries.
---
Under aid but make sure you claim them.
---
yup i’m on xbox too, same thing happens to me
---
If she'd like a proper team player my GT is Lindbloom826, I really only join teams *for* the teamwork aspect, so I'd be more than willing to help out.
---
Hopefully someone else can chime in because I only have second hand info but I've read that junky weapons cannot reach as high of damage as bloody ones when your HP is extremely low.
---
Just break the damn thing. Bonus is you won’t ever even have to fix it.
---
is  it April 1st?
---
Server lag. Same thing has happened to me yesterday.
---
There is a specific tab that shows your active subscriptions for Bethesda. You just hit cancel. It’s in Bethesda.net
---
I never would have thought of that! Good idea.
---
They need to do something about that joke of a skin they released for the handmade.
---
You could of thought good person sells good item wow I got a good deal :D I had a great session instead of calling somebody stupid.  Just saying maybe assume somin positive instead of negative.
---
I have a legendary rolling pin above the frame on my front door at my camp, so people already know the hell that will rain down on them if they try anything fishy.
---
It's being delayed and will still probably be broken....  Oh well.
---
Thats how i launched my first nuke. Stealth suit for the win.
---
Is it still plugged in?
---
Yep broken
---
BRUH I DIDN'T CHECK 🤣
---
I'm about to hit the star background. I've been doing heavy XP perking and afk NW which has both helped immensely.
---
Glad you mentioned this! I thought I was crazy when I completed the weekly "build up a workshop" challenge and saw nothing come across. Sucks, but I'm glad I'm not the only one.
---
I mean sucks that this happened but it's hardly a priority for everyone.  Shouldn't be at the top of the list because you think it should. I'm betting the vats bug affects way more players.
---
The only mod worth a darn is the explosive

I know the ammo converter sucks but you know what I can't stand? Hundreds of threads all saying the same thing about it multiple days in a row.
---
There is no cap.  Once you hit 2000, convert it, and you can put more in right away.  Yeah, it is one extra step, but you can convert as much as you want every day.
---
Being that negative must be tiresome man...

(walks up to contraption- starts smacking the top of the monitor like an old person)
---
Yea but I dont wanna use glitches to my advantage. Now that i think about it they could maybe make the suit's DR not count as DR for the berserker's effect or negate the suit's DR while a berserker's weapon is equipped
---
its good to see adrenaline threads cracking the first page of the hot tab
---
Omg ty, i was getting annoyed at finding 2 more. Bethesda should make these more realistic like build two of these 5 options, kill 1 cryptid, and the weekly have you do it maybe 5 times not all of these 5 times. They said these would be things i would do normally, but really Nope! I dont build in my base anymore as its capped and what do i need to slow down my loading screen more for? I REALLY Don't! The leveling...ok fine. Scrapping things is fine. The kills, they should really make it like kill 100 different things if you really wanted to make it stuff we do daily. Or if it should really be a challenge, then make challenge events that occur every hr or 30 minutes like faschnat for public groups to join and they be what counts as score. This will make a lot of people happy because they can grind when they have time and those of us that don't want to scrounge for specific things to scrap or build don't have to if they don't want to!
---
Glad you're crying like a little bitch got you what you wanted.  You're what's wrong with the world.
---
Nice.  Appreciate your answer.
---
Just like Wastelanders, it’ll be delayed and yet still have major problems
---
The ammo converter is a sales strategy. “Free crap item”. And clearly didn’t work.
---
Can relate to this opinion. Not even claiming all those unwanted rewards.
---
(holds the flashlight for you) are..... Are you sure that's how it works
---
I hope that rebuilding Atlas becomes a success, because I have a dream of rebuilding Harper's Ferry one day into one large player hub settlement...

Can’t have your weapon drawn

wood rather adrenaline plz..

How is there not a bullion machine to turn all the gold scrap into bullion?
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Classic fallout
---
What platform are you playing on bud?
---
I'm all good actually.  I'm not being negative at all.  I'm just being realistic about it.
---
This isn't true.  Plenty of wiggle room.  Plenty of posts about it.
---
I'm on Steam PC!
---
Noticed this yesterday and they seemed to be fixed for me today.
---
You got to 34 by just doing the repeatable 10k xp? Because I’ve done quite all daily, weekly, and the repeatable many times over and I’m like level 15 I think
---
No, it actually seems to be running better for me since the update (also on PC).
---
When I went from the XBox One to the XBox One X, it  was easy to move everything over using the dashboard.

Went to kiddie corner cabin and found two also went to wendigo cave for the wendigo
---
Im on rank 12! Not too far behind most from what i see in here. Thats good news to me!
---
Wow. 30 mins is too much huh? How do you even get up in the morning? Must be a rough life.
---
adrenaline is broken and the ui for the ammo machine is less than ideal..
---
You have to do it via xbox account for us
---
Log onto a web browser and get to ‘manage subscriptions’
---
You can’t access it through the console for some (FO1st) services
---
What's weird to me is that other games are using some ideas(as far as I know from f76) in their games. For example f76 has crafting and chests for storage right? The Gen Zero game seems to be adding those, even tho it's a creepy and lonely apocalyptic game in its own way with robots and better graphics and sounds(sorry). I am not sure adding crafting(even if it's in different ways) for example is where it needs to go. 
---
Fallout 76 has a more fun attitude versus other games of the genre, which is part of the draw.  The lore, the community, the direction(even if they stumble, if being honest) keeps everyone coming back. I know that's why I keep coming back. We've got some really awesome people who'll help each other and the newbies just like you'd expect to see in a tight community.
---
Sounds good in theory. But the name seems off... needs an acronym. You know, like C.A.M.P. , S.P.E.C.I.A.L. , S.C.O.R.E.
---
this is like, the one thing the sub agrees on.
---
I just run a max lvl standard backpack with no mods..
---
The huge difference that you're casually forgetting is that most MMO's have a mountain of content. Not "here are your 3 dailies... have at them!" but tons of things to do.
---
My primary experience is WoW. I played for way, way, way too long (closing in on 17 years, when you count original alpha and beta).
---
If one is to even ignore making a character and leveling from 1-120 through whatever mechanism you chose (bearing in mind that some classes start at higher levels such as death knights and demon hunters), and focus entirely on repeatable content for a single class... there is so much to do. Dailies (a lot more than 3 to chose from), dungeons, mythics, raids, battlegrounds, world PvP (no idea if this is still a big deal on PvP servers), pet battling, transmog (Pretty Pretty Princess Dressup Studio Deluxe... aka one of my favorite parts of the game). And that's all in an expansion which is captivating as a wet fart but still leagues ahead of Fallout 76. And while the game costs slightly more than FO1st, you're never going to be told "sorry, you've earned too much X today... come back tomorrow!"
---
Granted, there are downsides especially now. The rep grinds tend to suck. Flying tends to get locked behind super frustrating grinds upon other grinds, but unlike our version (bullion) at least it unlocks for the entire account. RNG can be a giant ball punch of sadness since corruption (?) has replaced titan/warforging with even more feast or famine when it comes to item quality. WoW has gotten pretty damned long in the tooth and the current game lead is incredibly tone deaf when it comes to player concerns and general push towards even more RNG tomfoolery.
---
But with all this, the moderately vapid "duh, all MMOs are like this" mentality really needs to stop. This isn't an MMO. It's a looter shooter that does both aspects rather poorly with non-persistent 24 player worlds. Hell, it can't even manage one of the most iconic elements of Fallout well... VATS has been broken on and off since BETA and shows no sign of being fixed anytime soon.
---
Given the whole BETA situation, it's likely that even if there is a QA team that Beth management would rather ignore them to push updates sooner
---
i have high capacity and the chemist backpack. usually run with the high capacity on.
---
I have done that as well since they came out lol.
---
They should fucking rework schorched beast spawning at my camp when I'm like level 30 and only thing I can do is relog cause I'll need like 2k 50. rounds to kill that son of a bitch
---
Im not OP, I am only lvl 12. Might hit 14 tonight if all goes well.
---
If your maxing out exp/hr, im guessing OP still plays a bunch.
---
No, the issue is that lots of the dailys give scrip as part of the reward.
---
So previously you found some legendaries, dumped them in the scripper, and bought 1-2 items from the purveyor. Next day you scripped the useless items you bought and went out looking for the rest.
---
Now because of the scrip as rewards, you end up with lots of scrip. So when you go to the purveyor you're not buying 1-2 items, you're buying 5-10. Or using the legendary modules to make your own.
---
So this causes a backlog, because now you have 5-10 to get rid of, except the scripper will only accept 3. You do some quests etc and end the day with a load of random stuff you've picked up, plus you still have 2-7 from the previous day left over.
---
You could put them in your vendor, but unless they're GOOD people wont want them, as they too are overburdened with junk legendaries
---
I's still want to know because you didnt answer the question. With the time investment SCORE requires as is to get to 100, what kind of rewards specifically would be deemed worth of your time ?
---
Thanks dudes
---
Yep! The Grafton Monster is usually raising a ruckus somewhere behind Hemlock Holes, and if you trek across the dry lakebed to the crashed vertibird the snallies should be around there.
---
Very popular opinion except among apologists who insist that this is a great game that has always been great.
---
It honestly boggles my mind.
---
Public teams are awesome and are super easy to join check your social menu.
---
Try sneaking up on enemies and using melee in early game. Melee is quite powerful. 
---
also. pro tip: invest a few points of luck in pharma farma. It'll keep you in chems for a long time.
---
My character is dependant on this perk decided not to play until it's fixed. Maybe farm a little daily because much more ammo is wasted without Adrenaline. I put a lot of work into developing a character who can take a gun with good qualities but low damage output and with my card set up make the weapons efficient.
---
its all I need.. what with deep pocketed and a probably atypically high str for a non heavy or melee build Im good right there
---
They should add a third piece that shows where the highest player in the season is, just a thought.
---
High capacity if you are a hoarder is a must have, armor plated and radiation resistant ones are no joke.
---
I love it.
---
But remember, us completing SCORE without paying or even having fun doing it aren't important. Player engagement (aka time staring at the screen while you slowly and painfully convert ammo) is the only important metric.
---
Mobile game monetization in this game should have been the first clue :(
---
Hey man, what system are you on? Some people suck -  most are pretty cool. 
---
But with the crummy first experience, Id be happy to make/drop some stuff for her or you both. Don’t want anyone’s first FO76 to be anything short of fun.
---
Let me know/happy to help
---
I assumed the point was to get some people to invest in endurance perks to balance the annoyance, thus diversifying the range of strengths / weaknesses of random players
---
yes.. exactly.. and when they both have adrenaline stacking under them its even better..
---
I prefer winning
---
I use armor-plated. It gives an extra 90 DR (which is huge), and there's no durability to worry about (backpacks never take damage and never need repairing).
---
Otherwise, high-capacity is useful if you're a hoarder. I wouldn't bother with any of the other mods.
---
you saw the trailer didnt you?
---
Didnt know you could get shrooms in Fallout
---
Birches don't know 'bout my Gnarled Shallows. Three Anglers, maybe 1 minute, 90 seconds max.
---
Normally on Heavy weapons you’d want legendary effects like [Explosive, Faster Fire Rate, Faster Reload, etc] Non-vats legendary effects are good on heavy weapons. If you plan on using power armor then Get Heavy Gunner perks for damage- Life Giver/Fireproof/Adrenaline- if you play alone invest in lone wanderer as well. :)
---
[Junkie’s you will receive a +50% Damage boost when addicted to 5 Chems, which is good, especially as you are at full health. My Junkie’s Explosive Handmade does 182 Damage, which isn’t too bad, but compared to a Bloodied Explosive Handmade, which will do over 400 Damage. Bloodied is the best for damage output, but is pretty difficult. Junkie’s is an all-round good build, as you get decent damage, and full health. In my opinion, Junkie’s! :\)
---
](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eeqepa/bloodied_or_junkies_which_one_is_better/#:~:text=Bloodied%20is%20the%20best%20for,decent%20damage%2C%20and%20full%20health.&amp;text=It%20depends%2C%20if%20your%20not,go%20junkies%2C%20otherwise%20go%20bloodied.)
---
I bounce between bloodied and junkies and pa/no pa with mostly only heavyguns as I get bored with each. Junkies is my favorite and I can kill anything solo but the queen/colossus without issue. Would recommend non explosive as the queen is highly resistant to explosive damage, and the lag inherent to the combat system results in a great majority of explosive shots doing zero damage. Bloodied also throws corpses/loot across the map and people will judge you for it. They're a hell of a lot of fun when they work though
---
Some of the prices I've been seeing on Xbox are ridiculous. 3-5 caps per 5mm and .50? Yeah...no.
---
I'm a frugal player, even with all my characters 20k+ caps, so I set my prices at what I'd comfortably pay for them.
---
It keeps steady traffic and income. Some days I spend more time trying to cap sink instead of actually playing. I've even chased down low levels and buy one .38 from them for 5-10k caps. Lol
---
That's a feature, not a bug.
---
I think they fixed the harpoon one. My harpoon with flechette mod is about 50/50 as to whether even one harpoon is on the mob when dead.
---
Max lvl standard pioneer scout bag with grocer mod from settler gold vendor. Reduces carry weight of food and water by 90% which is good as I carry around couple hundred purified water to heal with.
---
I hear you. Only recently with all the events going on that I’m beginning to see I slight issue with the weight.
---
I could not agree more. This thing is garbo!  
---
It is clear that the developers and testers do not actually play Fallout games.  
---
All these different convoluted screens and yet I cannot select how much to convert??  
---
After 40 clicks to scrap about 120 rounds, I dropped the rest on the ground and scrapped the ammo converter.. :/
---
Don't get me wrong i was bitching about it a few weeks ago until i figured it out
---
You don’t need a fast travel mat. You can already do that in-game by moving your physical C.A.M.Ps location. Move the location to a different spot within the same green zone as if you were moving any other buildable object. 
---
You’ll have to experiment a bit to determine where the fast travel spot will end up by fast traveling to your own camp.
---
Ur junkies shorty have limb damage?
---
Sorry I posted to the wrong comment lol
---
Watch your language young man!!
---
Bethesda: so we could we could stop delays and bring fallout 76 up to standard, or continue to  delay updates ignore the community just make more micro transactions remove 70% of atom drops in game
---
Or get starfield out and working 
---
Or get eldar scrolls 6 out and working
---
Or make a TV show.....well that's the winner right their just makes perfect sense
---
I didn't know that, thank you~
---
A good work around is to get a single piece of armour with the blocking effect and it will make ur shotguns op in vats.
---
Haha no worries, im real good at commenting on my own comment.
---
Move your camp then. If you can't handle the fauna then don't put your camp their.
---
Thanks! I’m already up on the lone wandering (though I join up with other players serendipitously) but I’ll grab some of those Heavy Gunner perks.
---
Not casually forgetting anything. People complain about the WoW grind. Even the gold cap. But when I played and players were trying to sell nether weave bags for 250+ gold when they were quickly becoming outdated. It was ridiculous. I played for 10 years, along with other MMO's, which I said MMORPG type games, not that 76 was a MMO.
---
Also, WoW is a horrible example to compare this game with. It's been out, continously growing in content for 17 years. 76 hasn't even been out 2.
---
How is that even possible? You would have to do the repeatable 10k xp weekly like a hundred times.
---
Since you dont have a specific build, whats your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. layout like, and what (if any) weapon perk cards do you have access to?
---
Handmade's are great, but if you only have 3 perception they wont be as much use to you
---
(loud due to not bothering to put hearing aid in) DID WE KEEP THE RECEIPT??
---
I appreciate that they rework it, I really do, but it also bugs me that this was released as is in the first place. I would really like to meet the person who looked at this and said "Yep, that's fine. Box it and ship it."
---
Like, seriously, things like these need to be tested by people on the PTS, you know, people who actually play the game and not just look at the CK all day.
---
Divide this heretic!
---
10 weeks from the end of seasons and your bitching that it’s impossible to complete?  It’s 3 days in for Christ sakes.
---
(crying and shuffling through my pocket looking for the receipt dropping the flashlight)
---
Haha, I got the same with 90rw. Hasn't left my inventory since I picked it up. lol
---
I just completed two weeklies, not autocomplete, and literally got nothing for them so I guess it’s just not working at all. Which is super annoying. Guess I don’t want the SCORE stuff thanks game.
---
Actually, a studio is making it.
---
I agree 100%.
---
As you cleared up down below, this isn't on the devs per se (though there is a HUGE gap in their ability to work with the Creation Engine in a timely, thorough or even competent manner) but the entire development chain when it comes to the game.
---
People were downvoted to HELL for not toeing the party line that Wastelanders would fix everything and bring on a new utopia in Fallout 76 (granted there were just as many people, if not more,  crying doom and gloom). And the same handful of diehards are still saying everything is fine while the house burns down. "I don't ever have any bugs" or "I've never seen that bug" are my personal favorite.
---
Even though we have a PTS, and making the very logical presumption that at least ONE person on said PTS expressed issues with the SCORE point issues (either the acquisition or the flat out false advertising that we could earn it from public events), ammo converter being a glorified carpal tunnel simulation, adrenaline breaking, Ward not being fixed in place, etc. Bethesda can't "fix" something without breaking 3 others.
---
I love Fallout. But this game isn't Fallout. It's a mediocre looter shooter that can't get either aspect right.
---
Got mine from snallys in rad rumble
---
You’re welcome! I had the same problem a few days ago :)
---
I carry a couple; armored and high capacity. I use the armored until I am over weight but I went with the high capacity first since I am a hoarder.
---
I didnt see the double xp score or xp anywhere
---
It better feature server disconnect, characters clipping through things, and other fallout-esque things
---
I want to upvote you so bad but your at 420 I'll let someone else take that bad juju 
---
But this is by far the coolest thing I've seen on this sub so far
---
Go to the Legendary Run game board from the Menu and click on the icons on the board. That'll claim them.  
---
In the case of things like the Lunch Boxes, the Vault-Tec supply caches, and caps, make sure you're on the character you want to receive them.  
---
The Lunch Boxes show up under Aid and the caches are in Junk.
---
i’m just chiming in, after seeing a post about this i went im and played a couple of games on tuesday and now have the bat paint unlocked for the AR, which i didn’t have before since i hadn’t played when that event was happening. just my 2c
---
This. I also prefer FFR on my junkies 50cal over explosive. I primed that sucker and it cuts through scorchbeasts. Best non glitched queen killer IMHO. Now explosive on a gatling gun is a lot of fun.
---
Not really, once you hit level 100 it slows down significantly. The XP required to level up basically doubles from what you needed between 1 and 99. I'm at 404, ask me how much I hate the level up challenges. ;)
---
It's another grind. On top of the basic cap/atom grind (the latter being heavily nerfed). Not to mention the other grinds introduced in Wastelanders.
---
***How many freaking grinds do we need?***
---
This isn't some super content rich MMO that has a monthly cost approximately that of FO1st but with enough stuff to do that you'll never end up having to do the same handful of events over and over and over while deciding which order you want to do your 3 dailies in.
---
Supply packs have been in the Junk tab, and lunchboxes are under Aid, if I'm not mistaken.
---
The ghillie suit and skins, no idea, I haven't checked them out.
---
Tbh, I'm in this for the Stars and Stars n Planets wallpapers. I can't paint my walls this way in real life, but dammit, I can have a Space C.A.M.P.
---
WoW also has a forced stream of income to keep the game growing. The subscription. Along with microtransactions.
---
76 has an optional "sub" with microtransactions. No where near the revenue source that WoW has.
---
The developers still need to be paid to work on the games.
---
They’re probably just gonna fix the terminal
---
I think a Black Mirror-esque approach to this would be interesting
---
let's make an consumable list that gives xp bonus to farm till the weekend lol
---
Yeah, sure thing, I agree with the sentiment, don't get me wrong. HOWEVER, Bethesda is patting themselves on the back after seeing positive posts like this, and that's the problem. We continue to grovel at their feet then they will do nothing to change their ways, so YES, you CAN do something about the grind by not trying to put a positive spin on their shitty practices.
---
I havent watched it but chances are.. I would understand very little of it unless there were pictures and text
---
Roleplay is a good one to use of your team is working on quests, or at least during the hand ins. Since every point of CHA is 5% bonus XP and Caps for helping someone else complete a quest. 
---
So there is a purpose too
---
I've done it at least 3 times since the update.
---
&gt; Anglers
---
That explains why I was at 1/3, the dailies started while I was doing Project Paradise. I didn't know anglers were a cryptid.
---
In all honesty once ya get on up there and can sell large amount of ammo then you don't even need to be there just sell all ammo for 1 cap other than cores and people will buy it like hot cakes
---
Keep your prices reasonable as you scale.
---
WoW in dwarf alpha (October 2003) had significantly more content than this. And only 2 races were available iirc (dwarf and gnome).
---
This was pre-talents and a level 30 cap. No dailies either.
---
Welcome to 76 friend. I’m on Xbox myself, but hopefully you find some good people to play with! A good squad makes the game sooo much fun
---
With events teams its XP for completing events. You get 25% base going up to 50/75/100% extra for having 1/2/3 bonded players.
---
Hunting team its extra XP for legendary kills. Again, 25% base, 50/75/100 for bonded.
---
Building team gives extra INT. +1 base, +2/3/4 for bonded.
---
Exploring is extra END. +1 base, +2/3/4 for bonded.
---
Roleplay is CHR. +1 base, +2/3/4 for bonded.
---
Casual is LCK. +1 base, +2/3/4 for bonded
---
Awwwww old people crying breaks my heart. Look what you did Todd!!!
---
Thanks! Man there are a lot of them :O so it must have been a bug that I was able to get it, il chuck in a ticket if I buy the pack and it doesn’t show :)
---
Depends on if you bought from him within the past 7 days.
---
Every Sunday I've been able to buy from him, haven't had the chance yet this week.
---
Sell ammo for 1 cap and ppl will buy it
---
Yup, from what I understand each 5 minute clip will be charged separately and will need to be unlocked using Atoms.
---
You can launch those yourself instead of relying on others to do it.
---
Do it yourself.
---
I had a lot of crashes yesterday, and a lot of little freezes with animations. Today, not so much.
---
My gun freezes in manual aiming mode sometimes, so that kinda sucks when I'm trying to do anything that is not aiming.
---
I also had a fun little glitch where I fell through the roof of Sunnyside Ski Resort Base and died. (Why, yes, I'm half-assedly running a Bloodied Build, so of course I died from a relatively short fall.)
---
When I'm not playing on a team, at least the crashes make me server hop.
---
Oh nice! I could definitely see myself doing that, thank you!
---
Yeah, at a different time of gaming. It wasn't the fad it is now. People weren't as "give it to me now" as they are now.
---
Agreed
---
Ahh sorry pal I’m on Xbox good luck tho!
---
I'm curious about this too.
---
Since you have to manually 'claim' each reward, maybe they just won't allow you to claim the bullion rewards until you're actually eligible.  
---
That's only a guess though. We need someone with a character in the right position to test this.
---
I feel like my Vats accuracy went to shit on my build since the update too
---
Good on them for listening to feedback. What scares me is that no one on this project pulled anyone else aside and said "Uh...this is dogshit, right?"
---
This addresses the problem but not the root cause of better internal communication, QA testing or...something.
---
I thought it was free to play? Is it not?
---
At no point during the whole "all future DLC will be free" was it also mentioned "and if people don't buy enough $18 skins and buy a subscription that is dangerously close to bait and switch, we'll have to shutter the whole thing".
---
FO1st gives you a private server (something mentioned pre-launch but never as a paid option) and the scrapbox. You can try to justify the extra "expense" of a private server, but it's quite literally another server instance spun up on AWS with a couple extra restrictions. How the hell is that and a feature that should damn well been in the game from the start worth so much per month? Is the 1650 atoms really the only justification?
---
And yes, devs damn well need to be paid. As a very old person going back to college to get a CS degree, I would very much like to be a paid developer. But what are we paying for? Recycled bugs? Incredibly slow content drip? Grind atop grind atop grind just to keep player retention numbers up?
---
Thank you for the useful info! I'm aware of the fact that junkies does less damage then bloodied, I'm just kind of worried I would die super fast when using a bloodied version of it.
---
Please come see my camp and buy my stuff - I'm a nice lady trying to make a living in the wasteland!
---
Technically the reason you can't get bullion is because you can't get treasury notes to turn them in for bullion.  Getting bullion straight up should just add it to your "purse."
---
At least in theory it should work that way.
---
I think it's fine
---
You need to make your own.  Get the plans from the enclave or make ultracite armor.
---
What platform do you play on? I can list locations if you’d like to farm but I can build full (specific) sets to help out
---
Interesting.  I might consider investing into a gauss pistol for my sniper build for this reason.  Thk you
---
I saw someone at Mama Dolces last night and I took a picture because it's just so bizarre. It's even weirder than the last Power Armor visual glitch with the arms looking like a grotesque ape.
---
It's the little things like this that I like. Relatively unimportant glitches are part of the charm.
---
Staring Todd Howard
---
So it's not that the game is badly structured and full of bugs, it's that we're just a bunch of impatient crybabies that want our binky NOW?
---
Seems like a bit of a stretch.
---
Lols
---
I sell most thing well below suggested retail price. For instance most of my plans for.camp items I sell for 25c. For some reason though I dont get.many shoppers.
---
Idk what system you're on but if you were to stop by my camp please don't bother dropping a PA suit. I have a partial set of t51b and I'll get the final 2 peices someday when I think about it. As for the paint job, smh, skins and paintjobs dont really impress me. I have never bought one and dont use the ones I've learned.
---
Give the suit to some other low level player. Thanks anyway.
---
Actually, yes they did say very clearly that the microtransactions would pay for the "free content".
---
The top of Watoga Medical Center and the middle of Watoga and WV Lumber Mill
---
They've had an objective each day for completing events and they have a repeating objective for 10K XP.
---
I'm nearly 400 and I've noticed it takes an hour of killing everything just to finish the last 40% of my level bar. Somedays I didn't even bother doing the daily level up. Now you can just create a character and exit the vault to level up lol or level up a mule.
---
I honestly don't remember that. If that's the case, I'll gladly retract my complaint about that one aspect.
---
Snallygadters count as cryptids
---
I'm sure it's just a bug that came with the patch , I'm using the camera one for now
---
https://screenrant.com/fallout-76-dlc-free-microtransactions/
---
I've been doing mostly event teams with the thinking that those players would be doing events and if I want to do an event I can do the  come hither emote and they will see and come help. Unfortunately it hasn't really worked so now I've been doing the building one so that I get an intel boost which means xp boost for everything. I get my damage on the queen and then start killing the mobs on the ground and it's seemed to work pretty well. Rad rumble too I leveled up from 121 to 122 and we didn't even complete the event
---
I am almost certain Bethesda has said it was a bug they will address.  Check all topics in this sub about score in the last 3 days, one of them has the link.
---
i put all plans that have a auto price of 500 to 50-70 and all that are 2k+ 500 caps, meds all 15-20 caps, ammo 1 cap each no matter the type I don't use anyway. and mods if I'm not mistaken  I put all 100 caps no matter with one. that's all what I sell ATM thinking on star selling legendaries but I don't have the space.
---
There's been like 20+ posts and comments about this in the last 24 hours
---
Aww thats fine!
---
I have two guys around over 450ish. I definitely understand but I played for an hour or so and leveled up twice just trying to get my score tokens to move. Of course I had cran relish, kindred, and bobbles.
---
Neither of which is what was said in that QA. That daily challenge is done once and it's gone, not to mention that it asks you to do any event, not public one specifically.
---
Here friend! Have this downvote on the house 🥰
---
Check this reply from Bethesda. Their FAQ is apparently wrong and public events themselves are not supposed to reward SCORE directly.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjciiz/you_dont_earn_score_by_completing_events/fwp151a
---
Edit: Wrong link.
---
Just remember the range of pistols is normally low and that will impact vats and accuracy alot.
---
For Snipering you are better off with western revolver or plasma sniper since they are more hitscan and faster firing than a charged guass shot.
---
Its fun to visit a camp where you can see that there have been some work put into it. Otherwise keep your prices reasonably low. Most vendors i visit are way to expensive! So dont be greedy. A tip to get lots of visitors is to have some weapons and armors for sale. Ammo is a big one too
---
Flame actually does more damage, but explosive is more satisfying.
---
So my muscle memory wasn't playing tricks on me! It really took a longer burst of junkie's gauss to murderxplode enemies.
---
Thank you! Where can I find new clothes? I'm tired of the vault suit..
---
Thanks tell your friends and come again
---
Super solid line-up, thank you for the breakdown!
---
Imo ultracite is your best bet until you get T65, in terms of overall resistances. You get a set for free by completing the brotherhood campaign quests
---
legacy guns
---
Praise the Holy Mothman!
---
But in a case where you are hopping from event to event, sticking primarily to mid-high level events and are willing to change servers when the events run dry would it be possible that you're making more exp? 
---
Just some simple math to illustrate my line of thinking, let's say you get 1k exp for completing a high level event. 100% more means you're earning another 1k for 2k exp total. If you're getting an extra 8% for everything, and let's say you're killing enemies averaging 200 exp that's an additional 16 exp per kill. You'd have to kill about 62-63 enemies to make an additional 1k exp (about 58 if you include the bonus from the event completion). Can you kill that many enemies in the same amount of time you could finish a high level event? Maybe. But I think in a lot of cases it would be tough. 
---
I think both group types have their merit, but I think there are too many variables to be able easily say which one is definitively better. Like I said before, ultimately I think which group is better comes down to how you're playing.
---
&gt; Somedays I didn't even bother doing the daily level up.
---
As a level 115 player, I feel you. Only it's most days for me now.
---
ive found that mid level players  40-70, tend to be jackasses. killing  legendaries at events  before everyone else gets a hit, being more obnoxious when encountering them im tje wasteland, etc. Not sure why. 
---
was.at uranium fever last night and a level 52 was standing in the opening where the legendaries were spawning and killing them. we couldn't get by him in his power armor to get hits.
---
i have multiple characters from level 6 to 236. i always try to help others, whether its reviving someone or  giving new player water, chems, etc
---
but it is true, trust no one in the wasteland
---
Actual change huh? Alright then off to wendi go caves I go for this Possum badge haha. Thanks!
---
I ran a quick google before responding and found an article that claimed VCs invested in Zenimax to the tune of 150 million dollars, tho granted i did not realy look into it further.
---
Thanks. That's number one bullshit though. And they still haven't corrected that "error".
---
I've spotted 2 snallygasters near the crashed vertibird there too
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
Thanks i got it now
---
the wife and I bought a second console so we could play together, we love it.
---
Now that this is a sticky it would be nice if mods would delete all of the dozens of worthless new threads people make crying about how bad the ammo converter is.
---
You're awesome I want you to know that you made me laugh so hard
---
I am shocked at how many people are choosing event teams to get xp. My husband and I have been doing building teams and even at +2 intelligence your per kill xp skyrockets. I can level up on a nice Line in the Sand with a full building team and canned stew and I am just over 200.
---
I play on Xbox:)
---
Angry turtle has good ideas.  I will try to do what he suggests.  I've been wanting an easy way to signal that I am willing to help new players, so this sounds like a winner.
---
Huh? Were they ever? You get loads of them straight out of the vault.
---
I have 15k caps (I can get 30k more) is that enough to but em?
---
They are making a Fallout TV show on Amazon that's pretty good right?
---
Happy to do gods work my friend ;)
---
I’ll check it out!
---
How do you "make" legendary weapons like that?
---
You mean like Battlefart I? Whose servers have been shut down and works only on server based multi-player?
---
I mentioned this earlier, but it would be wonderful if people posted their SCORE rank so we can tell if they are actually missing points or not.
---
Great tip! I’ll definitely put some armor and weapons in there too along with some ammo, thank you!
---
Ammo converter &gt; ammo converter posts
---
The missus did hers at nighttime - before patch 20, but time of day might be a factor?
---
I never even knew about this. I’ll have to check it out.
---
I had looked all around but must have missed them. I carry too much crap around.
---
What are you on?  I have all the plans.  I would love to make you a set.
---
The way I do it is sell weapons at 100 caps a star for the trash script ones. If it's decent I'll sell it for 500 a star depending on what it is. Armor is always 100 a star bc no one is buying it to wear regardless of what it is, their just scripting it or are new and therefore need armor cheap. Plans I sell all the ultracite at 100 bc even though it's the best aside from t65 you can get a full set from a quest...even that cheap it hasn't really sold. It really comes down to sell it for what you would pay for it.
---
Same here yesterday, the robot one completed and I got nothing...
---
i'd probably say 3 until you get a better one or 1
---
easy way to check. go find the super mutant behemoth in that pond west of twin lakes (over the mountain) and kill it with both. or find where mirelurk queens spawn.
---
2 is basically useless as you will miss your first vat shot no matter what
---
Don't forget your demolition expert for extra damage. And gun fu.
---
Whoa, ease up people. 
---
Don't get me wrong, this is good news but let's not celebrate it like the devs did us a massive favour. These are the very same people that made it so bad that it needed fixing.
---
I recommend a little stash and scrap area, put some food and drinks out. It deters people from going autistic and wrecking the joint. If they can buy out your ammo and cores, and refit right there it makes for happy peeps. 
---
And no mounted head plans. None. Nobody wants that shit hyper inflating the stock amounts on the map screen. Same with crap outfits and masks blowing out the 'armor' numbers.
---
Shhhh, don't tell some youtuber that Int would help.
---
I’m on Xbox:-)
---
Unless I missed something, VATS is completely borked.  I play a Gunslinger build, and there is currently a no damage bug that I encounter constantly on the first, and sometimes even second shot in VATS.  When using an explosive pistol, the explosive damage will register, but the weapon damage often doesn’t.  I routinely will have to shoot a scorched 2 to 3 the times in the head to kill it, with only the final shot doing any damage.  All three shots hit the target.
---
This is a different bug then then VATS Gauss pistol bug which makes the first shot always miss.
---
No, it’s all random.
---
Ah, thank God. Finally they listen
---
I started playing about a month before Wastelanders, I just get irked at it sometimes. Being a solo type player myself and going to the cranberry bog and getting attacked by 4 or 5 lvl 68 Scorched, a lvl 65 scorchbeast, and an lvl 85 scorchbeast gets me a bit frustrated.
---
I would use 4 if you use vats. 5 if you look down the barrel.
---
is the glitch/bug still going on?
---
I'm ps4 go to the market sub someone will custom make you a set of whatever you want over there for reasonable prices.
---
Likewise that's the best Reddit tandem skit I've had in a while!!
---
Did you accidentally scrap them?
---
Would you like max excavator? I can craft X-01 and ultracite full sets but I’m 90 copper short, should’ve looked at my junk before I offered that’s my bad
---
they're all over. like everywhere. the vault suit is underamor. And you can wear outfits over the top of your armour.
---
Had the same issues on PS4. You can't cancel it through Bethesda.net and have to do it through the psn account but when I found no option to cancel there my only choice was to remove my card details so it couldn't charge me. Something very dodgy about it all.
---
I always have cran on me and I usually don't care about levelling up at all, I mean, what for? I'm already sitting on 200 level up points I can use to swap my builds with. 
---
It's just that these challenges make it painfully obvious how long it takes to actually level up at this point. :)
---
Every source?! Thats a little extreme.....cross referencing will do wonders for your researching. Knowing whether a source is reliable is a good start, as well is checking their sources. Thats all you really need. 
---
I didnt watch the video, but you dont need sources to do simple math and I know how to do simple math so here it goes.....it would take 10 weeks to get 99 ranks (you start at 1, not 0).....you get about 215,000 [(2,000×7×10)+(7,500×10)] SCORE from dailies and weeklys and you need a little over 220,000 SCORE to get to rank 100.....add in the fact that you get 100 SCORE for every 10,000 exp earned (that includes single-player exp earned from Nuclear Winter, fyi, and leveling up in NW counts towards challenges, too), and the already announced double SCORE weekends, its very possible.....possibly even achievable by week 8 or 9 if you play all the time
---
Legendary modules from the purveyor and either the gauss shotgun or minigun plan
---
The decisions they have made for this update have cut my playtime from 1-2 hours per day to none. I don't feel like I'm making any progress with the new daily/weekly system, so there's no point in playing at all. 
---
I love the Fallout universe, but this update is the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
Same happened to me for all the ones I did after the 1st day
---
If you're on right now i can just make you a set. 51, 60, excavator, ultra, x01. Lemme know. I can mod all those except ultra
---
mine hasn't been letting me invite people lately. Even when they've been friends or favourites. Or if i do invite it lets them in and then kicks them out.
---
They are in one of the Medical hangers in Morgan Town Airport. I have a head, hand and foot but can't decide what to put in the display case with them. Perhaps my captured frog?
---
I hope they get skins for it cause it’s very ugly and blue
---
Sad thing is Bethesda is going the full 'mobile game' management route here where you aren't expected to grind for a whole day at once but rather to have to login each day, expend your 'energy/limits', buy something in the Atomicshop (the most important task here!) and then log off until the next day where you do it all over again.
---
Someone datamined a repeatable weekly quest that awards SCORE for completing a public event. I suspect that they will alternate between the current 10k xp one and the public event one. I guess we'll find out next tuesday.
---
Glad you're enjoying it now. See how you go in 6 months.
---
A lot of people start off like you did too.
---
They need to sell more Atoms, so they're willing to alienate a portion of their player base in order to do it. The influx of money they'll get from putting the game on Game Pass will probably offset the player loss.
---
That would be sick I’d love if we helped the responders move back into flatwoods and make it a town again
---
The recycled bugs are getting old. I was just thinking earlier of why don't they use builds that have the bugs fixed to build/release the new content.
---
The slow content drip is pretty obvious, at least to me, BGS is still pretty new to this type of game. ESO was trash when it came out. It's still a trash ES game, but not a bad console MMO. Bethesda needs time to fix bugs in between the content.
---
And how the gaming market is currently. They are a business that's going to follow the market trends. Same reason why very few single players games are being made by bigger companies. The new generation of gamers want, need, friends to play with. That's been a growing trend since PS2/360 days. 15 years? 
---
With how gamers are now. Rush through everything, games lose popularity quickly, and continuous games like 76, do not need that to happen. So companies force a slow down on the progression.
---
Going back to WoW and it's content. You had to work as a team to do dungeons at first, then heroics, then raids. They have fight mechanics and take practice.
---
The mass of modern gamers are not going to do that. They are not going to put in time or effort to earn stuff. 
---
All the complaints on here make that painfully obvious.
---
Now, 1st.
---
I'll keep mine. $8 dollars a month, that allows me to cut back on inventory management, hop on my private server to do new content without annoying people, on top of twice the cost in "free" atoms? I forget about my tent while playing solo, and the extra cosmetics? Meh. 
---
Yeah. It's worth it.
---
server.allow[ip:xbox.serverconnect][ip:pc.serverconnect][ip:playstation.serverconnect]
---
I'm no programmer, but that seems to be on par with Bethesda's code anyway.
---
I have no idea.  I grounded mine as soon as I was 50.
---
It has a little bit of value. The tokens to get them recently were duped so the price dropped a lot. You might get 1-2k from someone
---
Do you know what the actual numbers are? And if things like the damage over time portion of the flame frame scale with legendary effects and perks?
---
Because you say flame is better, but the other guy says explosive is better.
---
I am just interested purely in the damage.
---
Yeah I think so
---
Pro tip: make sure you’ve got enough power to run your shops or you’ll be like me, a flaming idiot, who’s wondering why nobody ever buys their things for over 3 weeks before realizing...
---
Not anymore. We can get it pretty easily now with the pleasant valley tickets.
---
Unfortunately for you, we MULTIPLY!
---
I know, but like I said, I can't put them up for display, they won't show up.
---
I wish that they wouldn’t have used that type of terminal for it. I can’t hardly read anything on those curved terminals. So my suggestion would be for them to switch the terminal out with the terminal from the scraping robot camp item. Obviously that isn’t the only problem with it but I sure hope they do change it.
---
Hmm I hard to say. My charged shots normally one shot everything with my two shot gauss pistol.
---
Damage does not show up on screen correct at all for any weapon.
---
Some of the damage numbers that do show up are just the explosive so I'm guessing the weapon hit but bounced off or something but that is rare.
---
I only play energy weapons so I don't have an explosive western revolver to test any more.
---
Nope, still got them.
---
Yeah, I remember how confusing Tangled Depths was. PoF was more of a questing/single-player expansion than HoT, but I still enjoyed it compared to the living seasons content. That's what drove me away.
---
3 or 5
---
If it’s a live service game such as this one it would be safe to assume that yes it would move over to the new consoles. If that’s an updated client to make use of the new hardware, that probably costs money so who knows what they’d do to get that return on investment!
---
I may not join a team, but that doesn't mean I won't try to help someone out. If they come to my camp, I have a couple of lower level weapons and a lot of plans for not a lot of caps, sure, can be found in most cases all over the place, but you never know what someone may need.
---
Following because also curious. Tired of being in the middle of Whitespring Golf Course and having to rotate lobbies 5 times before I get in with my camp
---
The game is just poorly optimized unfortunately so your experience is unfortunately common, but you can check the [following tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/464) if you like.
---
Got one a sold for 20 caps lol 
---
Got another from that bot
---
Same.  Did the "Gather building supplies" - never got the 1k SCORE
---
Same thing happened to me, really annoyed with this issue
---
I’m not avaliable right now(I was going to sleep:) I would be very happy if we could do it tomorrow? I can buy those coppers for you so you can make it:) 
---
Its 1 am here(europé)
---
Weird. What kind of case are you trying? Maybe it’s a bug
---
Waiting for the game to finish downloading, I’ll take you up on the offer, thanks.
---
Hoping for basically Z Nation starring Bruce Campbell
---
Don't underestimate the power of a charged gauss shot when speced right
---
Sounds good man. Sleep well
---
Awesome.  And you're going to make sure the people who grinded for hours and lost points get those added/restored, right?
---
PS4 in da house!!! I love it!
---
I Will thank you:)
---
Nope saves me a bullet to their head. ;)
---
I know there is one where you can build on the far right of the map, I believe it's near the sunken church. There's a destroyed house nearby so it's not too difficult to find, just inconveniently located. It's an above ground shelter so might not be what you're looking for.
---
Also curious about this. They sync data for Forza and Sea of Thieves but those are Microsoft so idk
---
In the image
---
Not to that level of detail no, but roughly, easy way out of a deadfall trap-camp (don't drink the punchbowl of lead champy).
---
Ive only ever found one lol but I think ita because I rarely see liberators now
---
no it wont
---
 there is no transfer across platforms
---
Update
---
Did they show up as upcoming challenges or just mysteriously arrive?
---
That’s where I got mine. Got an exterminators fancy western revolver last night. Not sure how rare it is though.
---
stick it in your vendor for like 999 caps someone will snap it up
---
Perception is around 7 I think, while charisma and intelligence are two of my highest. I believe endurance and agility are around the two/three mark.
---
Currently, I only really use enforcer and commando, since I also use a modified Hunting rifle. Other than those cards, I can't be sure what I have, but I could always try and get some more! I have a few levels that I haven't moved a point or picked a new card
---
Who the hell is unwilling to burn stimpaks to res people?  Are people just way nicer on PC?  I don’t even hesitate.  I always have stims coming out my ears and I’m melee
---
Anti-armor with the bashing damage, doesn’t bashing damage make shotguns “magical” or something
---
Very very true. Especially if you stop moving and the enemy has to.
---
It should have been since the beginning! Lol
---
If you google it there are routes you can take and pretty much for sure get a full set of t-51.  If I were you I’d take t-51 or X-01. I can hook you up too ;)
---
I doubt characters or items would transfer. There’s enough duping problems. People would load up accounts, activate game pass, jump platforms, spread BE Gat lasers everywhere.
---
If she is on PS4 look me up (sevristh1138) i would be happy to help, I have tons of plans and scrap.

---
Wait is this a thing? Haven’t fought him yet, but if we’re getting ballsacks than I’m gonna put in a little more effort to find him.
---
I'm saying it's not a bugged I'm  saying it's working as intended but you cant use your unyielding armor without radshield and diluted radawayfor bloody builds. Otherwise throw on a reddit or power armor.
---
Thats awesome!    I once came back to camp and someone left me a gift right in front of my vendor...it was nice.    So i started doing the same...usually with water and food for lower levels...even if i don't buy anything.    
---
By the way, i leave my water purifier open.    if someone takes water from it, they don't become wanted...right?    I've always wondered.
---
It only halves the decay rate, it doesn't stop it.
---
I just head to Charleston after every few events and shoot the poor level 10 Grafton Monster.
---
Now pay your tithe to Atom. That'll be 2500 atoms.
---
They call it a vocal sac but we all know it's just a misplaced nut.

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wendigo_colossus_vocal_sac

Is that what those giant orange balls are in some player's dispay cases?
---
Mine just went in to a tall display case without any Problems. Be careful not to junk them first though, did that first time and had to jump servers to get more.
---
Oh thanks missed it completely
---
For other players to be able to access your private server, you need to be friends with them and they have to be friends with you.
---
I appreciate it, I do:) but another kind redditor like you offered to make me one:-&gt; 
---
This game has a really good community Helping eachother. When I can, I’ll help other people too👌🏻
---
I'm used to shooting moving targets.
---
So you played once and had fun because you won?  Not really a shocker there.
---
1 and 4, and use vats. Theyre bugged to do massive damage in vats even tho the first shot misses all the time
---
It's a precaution so that random people don't access your private server, and being friends with them is a way of allowing access :)

You can get xo1 power armor plans for free by doing the enclave quest line.

Hrm. Vanilla WoW was full of bugs and things when it came out. I think your  nostalgia is taking control.
---
Even the re-release of Vanilla WoW had the same bugs and stuff.
---
The NW auto-complete bug was sadly never fixed, and I experienced it pretty much every day (I play NW a lot).  I actually tested it today on SCORE though (because I don't care much about the seasons stuff) and it did NOT auto-complete.
---
And do it alone? No way....I’m not ready for that
---
Need the big guns
---
Congrats you bringer of death
---
I'm not able to scrap new parts of my camp.  Placing floors and stairs works fine, but when trying to scrap/store/move them, I keep getting "Cannot remove item: Part of the structure would not be accessible."  I can put stairs on a floor going up to nothing, and still be unable to scrap the stairs.
---
I've had weird beeping noises, like a Walmart scanner, when I pick things up.  Today I could not use LB/RB to change between data, radio etc. Had to exit the game entirely.
---
Sometimes dialog is bugged. Try opening your pipboy and closing it, that fixes it. Unless it's something else wrong.
---
This was beautiful
---
It was great i bombed the queen and got about five shots in before a bloodied build destroyed her so i got nothing from the drop :)
---
It's likely that there are multiple bugs contributing to this single problem, they could have fixed one and thought things were solved without knowing about the other contributing bugs.  You have the bug related to NW that auto completes everything but it's also possible to have just a few tasks auto completed even when logging directly into the game.
---
I gotcha, thanks for the help! Looks like I’ll be sending out a few friend requests later hahaha
---
Flooded train station near watoga
---
I love you can I give you more than 1 upvote?
---
Did you do it really quickly?  I saw a post that said the effects "randomize" every other second and if you make/roll two things quickly it can have the same effects.
---
Just what I heard though, have no idea if there is any truth to it.
---
If so, I hope it's new Vegas based. I'd love to see the origins of the legion and how the strip was established.
---
Odd, I’ll have to see if this happens later when I try it out good to know though, might have to be a single player session later if this is the case
---
Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go. 3 Snallygasters on a fixed spawn point.
---
Im ridiculously excited about this, but trying to keep my expectations in check.... Any word on when?
---
D
---
It has its ups and downs. Some days you cream the map, other times the map creams you and you last all of 2 mins. It helps running with a good team.
---
True
---
Yes, everything is unlocked at my camp :) even raiders and bandits need friends haha
---
well it's gonna be free on xbox gamepass soon. so you can play it for free on xbone or pc. IF you have gamepass.
---
If you've never had gamepass you could find a free trial maybe
---
Because from a business standpoint you're better off having content stretched out over a long period rather than letting people rush through it at the start and then have nothing to do.
---
It's all about retention, you want to encourage your customers to regularly play the game so they don't wander off and are then less likely to return.  It's the same idea behind the original atom daily challenges and now Seasons.
---
Yeah, I guess I was thinking about how we transfer things in and out of the stash and vending machines. Drop in our full load of .38 and it adds up the credits. Holding on to odd numbers of the ammo until we can convert is silly. We are united in annoyance!
---
With the right build, Encryptid is easy. My record is 10 solo in one night.
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed it when I want a change of pace from the main game
---
I think Artkos has some in Area A. I'll check this out in a few minutes doing a drug run 😁
---
I heard that they think it gives us too many ammo...Aaah, just joking. Great news.
---
Then only being able to store 2000 Ammopoints.
---
What!!!!!!!
---
I like several Amazon shows, plus I enjoyed West World, so I have high hopes for this if it happens.
---
I think it’s super fun!
---
Cheers for the explanation! I was running 5 points Charisma for LW and Travel agent/Tenderizer, I've upped it to 6 points now so can share 2 pointers.
---
Hiding in bushes is fantastic!
---
Bet there will still be glitches in the show...
---
Someone emailed Bethesda yesterday and they were told they can't add score points but apparently they are giving 150 atoms instead to cover the rank you would have lost. The customer service guys are doing the maths and only giving the atoms for the ranks you lost so don't bother trying to claim for sure you haven't lost.
---
Even a basic player would be able to see how awfully designed it is. My thoughts of how it would work without even knowing about how it actually did exceeds reality.
---
No, no, no. You all stay away from my acid farm you hear me?! There arent any snallygasters there, I tell ya. You just turn around now, nothing to see here...
---
Dont make me go full old man with kids in his yard.
---
What I deleted was the wrong article. I'll find the correct one/s later and share them if I remember too.
---
Yeah its odd.look up angry turtles yt vid.basicly any shotgun and other guns are .op as hell with the right perks or you can bypass it with one piece of armour that's usually considered trash.lol
---
Toxic Larry's has 3 Snallygasters.
---
Kiddie Corner Cabins does as well, but it can spawn Radscorpions instead.
---
Maybe there is another guy named therealpuprock with one too but his is floating and mine is not my gt is igneousflame573
---
This is how I imagined it to be, not the shitshow we got.
---
True, but I’d rather wait if they’re going to take our input and make changes to make them better than drop legendary perks that no one wants.
---
Very likely a bug, but I killed some anglers on Tuesday and they counted towards the “kill 76 cryptids” challenge, so try those as well
---
They’re always at the Tygart water plant if you need a few.
---
Exactly.    Fallout is for me, freedom to play in a vast sandbox and how i want to play.    It's frustrating but in a good way...i guess.    It gets tedious but there are soooo many other things you can go off and do when it does.    Every night, i look at my Camp and wonder "should I move".   nah...    I like this area.     Sometimes i simply go for a stroll and what's really cool about FO76 is that there are real people that you can you go and hang with for a bit...go blow something up, kill a scorchbeast, or just sit around and play a banjo...that's cool!    
---
Welcome back...
---
Pressing escape will exit the terminal on pc.
---
Considering how it goes on my side i'll say yes but i can't hide the main reason i stick playing ( 1670 hours after ) is the cool team i am playing with, the recent patch added public team wich are more than awesome for New/players
---
Since wastelanders this game has become more of a job than a fun game to play. Some days I'd run out of time to do my dailys or just couldn't be bothered logging in and now I have to log in everyday, I have to complete my dailys and weeklys everyday. I'm lucky I run with a good team cause at the moment the game is just meh.
---
The x01? It's not too hard to find the plans in the bunker
---
I'm hoping it takes place on the West Coast, since Bethesda seems to have no interest in going there.
---
I noticed my carry weight was wonky the other day. I couldn't figure out if it was the mutations or just another bug. My ammo was doing weird stuff before the update.
---
If you hook up with a discord server you can track events by call outs from members.
---
Maybe you've been in power armor for some time.
---
Reworked? It should have been worked in the first place.
---
Ammo scrapping belongs on the tinker bench, far more intuitive.
---
I must admit the hiding in bushes aspect is a necessary evil, being out in the open is suicide
---
Thanks for what? 
---
Continues releases of broken content and money grabbing bullshit?
---
After 2 weeks
---
yes...in 2 weeks though
---
It’s how I managed to live 19 mins and get the Score points today.
---
Ive been exploring in the bog a bunch and haven't been through the forest region for a spell..so ill make another run though it soon
---
After the first two weeks of the season are over you can
---
It’s you... It’s really you...
---
I was crying all of last night.
---
GO YOU!
---
Unfortunately the weapon is only good for scrip
---
although it might be worth something to someone who wants a cryolator.
---
I took the idea and just went a made a full standalone post

Grafton Monster and Charleston Capital and the area  where Melody Larkin talks about Church in Charleston.
---
Thanks for the info....
---

---
PSN
---
Yup, that's people who wanted to add insult to injury to the Colossus.
---
I've got a LOT of harpoon ammo and such that no-one will buy, at least I can put that to some use once I unlock the converter.
---
1. Keep your machines organized.  If someone is looking for one particular type of goods from you they don't want to go looking through all four machines to catch some chems here and some there and then more over there.  Labeling each machine is nice but not necessary.
---
2. Place your machines in view of your fast travel location or if your camp design doesn't facilitate that then point people in the general direction of them using something like the vault boy cutouts.
---
3. Keep a stash within reach of the machines so people can quickly check theirs if necessary.
---
4. If your machines are indoors DO NOT put an always active decon shower at the entrance.
---
Just go to  **Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go** and you'll find 3 snallygasters. ezpz
---
I loved Wastelanders until I completed the story. Now it's nothing but a grind simulator. Guess I'll come back once they add more story content.
---
This is exactly what I did when I saw the challenge.
---
Does it wear off though? I lost it when I logged out.
---
I presume this works vice versa :p
---
No they have all different effects with the prefix. This happened with my gauss mini as well.
---
3 anglers at gnarled shallows worked for me
---
Thanks for your input. I’ll do this as well. Sounds like we’re playing a bit the same style.
---
Yeah, all of them expire after an hour
---
Ugh, please don't remind me of vanilla OR classic!
---
First off, I totally don't get the love for classic. Not even slightly. Nostalgia goggles are great and all, but there has been a solid 15 years of QoL improvements that I just can't imagine living without. Not to mention that 2004 WoW is ugly as sin by today's standards.
---
I don't forget any of the awfulness of classic. I started playing at 8am on day 1... on one of the biggest pvp servers (Archimonde) which was the pvp beta server repurposed. 5 minute loot lag, where you were quite literally stuck with your character crouching, was the norm. Mail lag, general lag. Lag, lag, lag. It was ghastly for a solid month at least. At all hours of the day.
---
My favorite class (paladin) had received talents some 2 weeks prior to launch and there was a bug with a skill called "seal of the crusader". I don't believe it was related to talents per se, but the very late date finishing the class did not help at all. A couple months in, it was "fixed" basically killing retribution (DPS) and the protection tree was a delightful joke outside of using reckoning bombs in niche situation... so it was plate wearing priest or gtfo. I honestly almost stopped playing at that point since I wanted to smash pixelated jerks, not have healing being the only realistic option.
---
Classes were fucked up. Hard. Mage was super duper OP. Only 1 class could even tank at the raid level, despite 3 technically having tanking trees (4 if you consider shamans, sort of).
---
But even with all of the stupid errors, especially those that could have been fixed with just a bit better timing, it was still head and shoulders ahead of where FO76 is now. And that sucks.
---
This is the most logical answer.
---
I hope this aint a jinx.... I take no fall damage. Like at all. Ive been trying to die from a fall. Think I'm a waterbear y'all!
---
Well I’m a proud hoarder lol. Thanks for your input
---
Totally destroyed my stealth crossbow character., But as long as it's being worked on , l'll convert to stealth lever action in the meantime.
---
There's lots of good suggestions in this thread. The robot from Encryptid isn't a cryptid, they're specific monsters.
---

---
I’ve seen some cool camps built under the bridge near Thunder Mountain.
---
I would imagine that with the explosive you can bump the damage up using demo expert which would make it better....but you will need to waste several perk points to get the full potential out of it.
---
Burning damage tends to be pretty solid though.  Not I'm game so I can't check all the stats of the base weapon for you.
---
Oh okay thanks. I’m a biig hoarder. I’ll go with the high cap and then maybe the DR afterwards. 
---
Thanks again.
---
Ooooooooooooo ok i got it now.....snallygasteres wendingos mothman
---
im on xbox.. i have seen that holding B should do it. thanks though.
---
Also very smart. 
---
How muc HP does Purified give?
---
It's super fun and helpful to find the bodies of my victims. I was sad it was gone. I always lose loot piles in the tall grass.
---
Watched some videos and see where hardball should be. :/ Nowhere to be found, can he only be found at night? Is there a bug where hardball and the dead body don't spawn? 
---
I don't know why I keep playing this game. Ra ra mission bug, numerous others. Very frustrating, defeating, -70 bucks plus tax.
---
Why do people lock their doors when we can't steal stuff from their stashes?
---
Yeah which group is better comes down to how your playing and how fast you can kill. Both groups have their merits, like if I’m on my alt leveling, I’m going to be using building teams, but if I’m on my main and I know  I’m going to be doing events, I’ll obviously do event teams, or if your really into optimizing stuff you can switch the teams in the social menu and get the best of both worlds.
---
right.  I figured I would give the season a fair shake.
---
I actually started playing again after a few weeks off, but I'm only playing my normal small amount.   I figure i'll give them a week or two to add a handful of other ways to get points, so that its not disgustingly difficult.  but if they dont, then ill just stop playing again.
---
Good it felt like one of those 30 minute surveys just to get .5 cents
---
ive notice that for awhile now, it goes down 10-15lbs and eventually come back up.
---
i try to figure it out but no idea either,
---
Went to a camp yesterday and the guy had a large warehouse set up with farmable tiles inside. I could see maybe 3 corn and 2 tatos. Other than that it was empty. Level 3 lock on the door......
---
You have to give a credit to that engine tho, in what games you can interact with so many items and objects in the open world, there like millions of them at the time
---
Yo Warframe is fucking free to play and got free battlepasses that require half the time of the entire event to finish. 
---
What the actuall fuck is wrong with bethesda ?
---
Their greed is showing more and more and it's fucking disgusting and a disgrace to gaming.
---
I can understand skins behind some fee to finance content, but 12 bucks for a reskin and 5 for a fucking door mat  ?
---
Do they even realise why half the people don't buy Atoms?  Because everything overpriced as shit, people would spend money if they think they get a bang for their buck. 
---
Fallout 1st, a service more expensive as a console online subscription that offers up to 4 games along with it and gamepass with 100 games playable a month.
---
Now they strip the earnable atoms from 7000 to 2000 and made a season battlepass that's the grindiest shit i have ever seen and put the only decent items at the last few levels that 99% of your average joe can't even complete! 
---
Fuck man im so annoyed by their greed and lies.
---
Lol right! Every day I play a lot I have to do a whitesprings run buying all the stuff to make ammo and I use a regular fixer bc screw flux farming. Got to hit the button too many times at 21 rounds per it takes a long time to get to the 3 or 4k I like to start my next session at.
---
It seems to do a ton of damage even without the charge up, is this part of it? Not even using vats and it's knocking most enemies in 1 shot.
---
Public events team with 3 links gets you 100% event XP too.
---
This is awesome!! Herbivore mutation will boost veggie based food buffs x2 so Cranberry Relish will do 20% XP (25% with Strange in Numbers?) Also, ALL the Intelligence buffs that you can stack, stack. Each point of INT adds 2%XP!
---
I saw some guy go down after scorched earth and everyone just crowded around him and waited for him to croak and drop his loot, so I ran in and revived him
---
You got it when you completed 3/5. Weeklies are bugged and normally award earlier than supposed to
---
Wait to claim it?
---
Also Grafton Day if that procs and the grafton monster behind hemlock holes
---
Look at the many trailers they have released. If nothing of that makes u feel like u should dump 1000+ hours into this game, I sudjest u get something like animal crossing to spend your time instead.
---
I haven’t gotten any spikes back from my explosive railways since wastelanders patch. Btw, how was it harming anyone when these ammo types are recoverable? Is there railway and harpoon envy going on in this game? Lol
---
To save people from having to use it. It is the same reason you lock a gun in a gun case - so that people don't hurt themselves with it.
---
So, this one and a few others with multiple objectives are bugged. This one has been awarding it's points BEFORE it's completed.  Somewhere around half way.  Are you sure that you didn't just miss the pop-up?  
---
Either way.  Send in a bug ticket to Bethesda to get it fixed.  Make sure to take screenshots of the challenges in question, and sends those as well.
---
Wastelanders definitely adds a lot to the game and is worth the play imo
---
I use to lock my crops away back when everyone was crafting alcohol for the challenges, but yeah it's not really that important now.
---
Congrats. I was mega nervous to do my first, but didn't think it was that bad at all with a bit of research/planning. Glad you enjoyed.
---
Haha!
---
The cryolator is worth a little bit a quad cryo is good for queen fights
---
From help.bethesda.net
---
Different company. Different software and hardware (BGS has to include console limitations). Different game type. 76 is no different than any of the other FO games produced by BGS, except that it's online.
---
It's basically Fo4 with some adjustments, and the issues, not related to online and MP, are the same except on a larger scale due to the online aspect.
---
Like I said early on. WoW is a horrible example to use in comparison.
---
Destiny 2, or The Division 2 are closer comparisons imo, but they do not have a player economy. Same kind of grind and amount of content, though.
---
Can someone explain too me what meat week is I've been a player since 2019 and I think I might've skipped it but what do u do what's the rewards etc
---
I’m ok with that! I’m just psyched to finally do this. I tried only once before and failed miserably. So woohoo! ☺️
---
Ah.  Must just be the mysterious ways of RNJesus.
---
I have heard of people swapping lobbies between rolls because they think it helps.
---
No idea when. All I know is that the guys who did WestWorld are behind it
---
Select NW mode. 
---
Turn off fill team. 
---
Come back in 15 minutes. Press 3 buttons to be back in the next NW.  Repeat as needed. This requires *less effort than using stims*.
---
Lmao well mines a Casino and I will happily take donations for other fellow wasteland to get
---
I actually bought the plan for those this week. I need to move my CAMP though so Im holding off on that before I bother incorporating them and the other planters somewhere. They would make things easier though Im sure
---
Sometimes you just want to be able to afk in a room and know people wont come shoot you. Now why you need to lock your entire house and hide all your workbenches to do that I don't understand. I like to sit on chairs through windows to get inside locked camps and leave raw fertilizer for them.
---
Exactly this, the only reason public teams had a shot was because earnable score rewards for things like building and events, heck now that people know this i already see a decline in players participating with each event.
---
Why is it that bethesda get a idea and then completely fuck it up??
---
Anglers also count as Cryptids. Did a hoard event and gave me the achievement instantly. You can find 3 in the mire in the Gnarled Shallows.
---
Charisma isnt terribly useful - it has its uses, but its one of the less useful, particularly if you play solo.
---
Rifle builds generally want a lot of perception, and is complimented by agility for sneak bonus.
---
You might want to consider using a semi auto reciever on assault rifle/combat rifle/handmade. It wont fire quite as fast as the automatic, but it fires fast enough - you just have to tap the trigger a lot.
---
With that in mind, you could take 1 level in rifleman/expert rifleman/master rifleman, and 3 levels of tank killer (armour pen on rifles). Its not as ideal as 3 x 3* but its the best bang for your availble points. Consider shifting some points into perception though.
---
By using the semi reciever, you can then benefit from the rifleman perks on your handmade AND on your hunting rifle.
---
This for example was what I used when I had a rifle build:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f345f8&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2pe2eh2s01c72ic4ar2an2ao0a04au2l71lt2lu2sv3
---
You can get better damage using VATS abilities, but personally I really hate using VATS and prefer to free aim.
---
I hope it takes place in the Midwest
---
bonuses of the same type, from the same type of source (chems, drink, food, booze, etc) do not stack.
---
So you can stack a leadership bobblehead and squirrel stew for example, since one is a bobblehead source and the other is a food source
---
Im at 5. I only need to move one point over but at the moment I dont know where I can get that one point from with sacrificing something I feel I need still
---
That'd be pretty cool too.
---
All will bow before the iron fist of COMMUNISM
---
Leave team option in menu
---
as a non-meta user im kinda glad its broken, shows how strong such a perk is and why its in pretty much every single build
---
From what I've observed, in cases where I didn't get score for completing a daily or weekly that I distinctly remember having been awarded a sizable amount at about the halfway point of working towards that goal. 
---
So I suspect while you didn't get the score at the end it did give it to you some time earlier.
---
Under your name in team list
---
Open map, open social - on the top of the social menu is 3 icons the middle one is for team, click it then right click your name and leave team
---
Keeps the follower from opening the door, leaving it open, and allowing critters to come in and wreck things far more fragile than your walls.
---
Are your keys sticky? What have you been doing? Why are they so sticky? Have you been naughty?
---
I had a stab at a few things - getting killed, removing all gear and switching worlds, trying a different set of armour, nothing seems to be making a difference.
---
The only thing I've not tried is stripping the mutations away and reapplying them as I've not got the necessary serums to do that. So, I'm at a loss for now.
---
I always found some radscorpions there. Never any Snallygasters.
---
With a level 30 Fixer?  You totally rock!!!   Awsome!
---
Haha, was like fuck it. I'll move on to the next thing. Went to Sam blackwells elevator bunker thing. Went down and tried to fight lvl 21 claw thing. Can't do a single bit of damage (I'm lvl 42). 
---
Fuck this game.
---
Sorry busy day yeah if your wearing the backpack then the perk is being negated.
---
Lol I built an entire camp at launch without a door and used this. I remember when I met one of the guys I still play with I invited to my camp and got inside and was motioning for him to follow and he kept using confused emoji. I showed him and it was like 😳💥
---
I'm actually surprised at how well the engine is handling 76 on a whole.
---
I assumed that it would be way worse with how Downtown Boston was on 4.
---
Granted many areas in 76 run like that, but it's online with multiple different instances happening at the same time. 
---
My Private server it runs like a dream without all the other stuff.
---
With how relatively smooth 76 plays, I'm really hopeful for Fo5 and ES6! Well, as long as they stay away from MP.
---
I've seen people build camps with 10+ doors and had every single one of them locked waaaay before allies were added
---
And do t forgot double exp weekend will help make up for with repeatable exp challenge
---
Yes u need to learn the plan (it is a low chance to drop from the encryptid event, or you can buy one from another player) 
---
After you have the plan unlocked, you can get it as a purveyor drop when you turn in scrip at the purveyor ...
---
Indeed.  They will drop from the legendary vendor.  And possibly legendary enemies but I'm unsure as I've never had it happen to me yet.  I feel like I remember reading that though.
---
That challenge is apparently rewarding the 1000 points at 3/5 instead of 5/5. You likely got the points, but didn't notice at the time.
---
QA can't bug-fix a bad design.
---
All of this! 
---
I always have my buddy fast travel to my new camp spot a few times to make sure I know where people will spawn. Can't tell you how much time I waste trying to find the entrance of buildings and I somehow always go the wrong way first.
---
And if you do put a rad shower, put it on an easily accessible switch. If I can't get in without having to swallow a bunch of toxic goo after, I'm not going in, I don't care what you got lol.
---
Wow, this is super helpful! Thank you so much! I'll be sure to swap some of my perks around tonight then :))
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition.
---
Thanks for the reply. I’ll keep on scripping
---
What the ever-loving fuck is THAT? and what did it fuse with there?
---
Thank you yeah! I can’t find fixer plans! So I used what I could! ☺️
---
I’ve been having the first shot hit almost all the time. And during Uranium Fever I connected with a 0% VATS chance when the Miner went spring the corner.
---
Well, more I was explaining why I do it \*now\*. 
---
As it is, I can't trust people to kill mobs that spawn at my camp when they shop at my vendor
---
I've been seeing them, usually I  show up to a pile of corpses with robot or bear having already killed everything to include the legendary spawn.  :\\
---
Thanks! Now i just need to grind the plan
---
ive had this thing going on even before going junky, so i dont think it has something to do with mutations neither deseases. 
---
its really weird and i still didnt figure out what.  triggers it. i usually see it after i went into battle, sbq or whatever shit show i was into so idk lol
---
I don't wear Power Armor, only Secret Service Stealth but backpack persists with that.
---
I've made some fresh Cranberry Relish, going to time their life just to see.
---
Same! I’m ready to do it again... what a blast! And conveniently I have another nuclear keycard I’ve been saving ☺️
---
Almost always a Wendigo at the Halloween Shop, and two snallygasters at the pylon by Bogtown. But Toxic Larry’s is the easiest.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Oh cool! I’ll stock up on ammo and give it a go next queen fight!!!
---
The problem is that none of this is hidden information. There is a solid 20 years of easily observable data about MMOs (which is not to say they have a 20 year history... I've played MUDs!) and what works.
---
Fallout 76 is not a MMO. It never will be. But it's striven to add bits and pieces, but has done it in all the wrong ways. A really slow and painful grind is never fun, but when you have an actual achievable goal you can make an argument for it. When it STILL comes down to RNG in the end, that just sucks.
---
Bethesda is not some young, scrappy indie studio that's testing much bigger waters than they're used to. Yes, BGS doesn't directly work on ESO, but it's in their same corporate umbrella of products! There was so much they could learn from just seeing what worked and what didn't insofar as ESO to figure out beforehand a basic direction. Instead, they've gone the laziest route possible of just making progress harder and less rewarding at every turn. That is not content. That's just malicious indifference.
---
As for WoW mandating team or even guild play... well duh! ;)
---
It was an MMO from the ground up. Not as an afterthought. Mind you the introduction of LFR in Cataclysm radically changed the need for guilds or even specific people to play with. Contrast that with most of Fallout's content... easy and completely able to be done solo. Though there's a wrinkle in your argument... if modern players aren't going to bother to learn mechanics and work on their skills, why is Fallout introducing harder content? Specifically stuff that requires teamwork (without any of the tools to make teamwork possible) and understanding more than "SHOOT GO BOOM" such as pylons in Sheepsquatch or the clusterfork that is Project Paradise.
---
As for recycled bugs, the answer is sad. They don't know how to use version control. Hell, I'm a n00b programmer and I damn well know at least the concept behind it. But bugs keep getting reintroduced time and again. Add to that, bugs that never leave or new bugs that are baffling in the extreme (fully working skills just breaking such as adrenaline) and the picture is very worrying. They're working on a small subsection of code with no idea about the big picture and things break very easily due to spaghettification.
---
Even more worrying is that so many people just don't seem to care. Or worse are actively hostile to the mere suggestion that there are bugs. Honest posts about bugs get downvoted to hell. The mantra of "I've never had that bug" or "I don't have any problems playing the game" is bad form. If I have no problem getting my CAMP build just right, even with some weird and complex glitching required, there's no way in hell that I'm going to crap on someone who can't delete a stair or wall that's literally not holding anything up yet flagged as such. What is there to gain with provoking someone who's already getting frustrated by a broken game they want to love?
---
And that's the worst part my friend. I want to love this game. The combat is mostly shit and the loot is too. But the world building, art and voice acting are mostly spectacular. And even though it's a horrendously buggy and artificially restrictive mess that I've learned to work around, base building can't be beat. I've been combing the Steam summer sale for anything that replicates that one aspect, and outside of primarily PvP oriented games am stumped to find something that's primarily co-op.
---
Lastly, FO1st might be worth it to you... but that doesn't make it less icky feeling to have to pay for what should be base functionality. At the very least the scrapbox. Come on Bethesda, why so stingy?
---
Private world last for 30 minutes as you leave the server.  
---
Supply drops aren't any special thing so you didn't lost too much.
---
I'm a full-health stealth sniper (rifles &amp; bows).
---
When it's not broken, for everyday/general purpose use, I run Adrenaline at 2\*, so that I can easily switch it out with Mister Sandman at night without having to touch any of my other Agility perk cards.
---
But I also have it at 5\* for those comparatively rare but definite occasions when I expect to be swamped.
---
*laughs in melee build*
---
I just server hopped at the Summersville dam 3 times and that was that.
---
I found a vendor selling a load for 100 caps each a while ago and bought a few. I'm always paranoid about people glitching into the silo and and launching before you get there though. Wish people wouldn't exploit the game so much.
---
Taking a carnivore serum will give you the mutation but will not take away the herbivore mutation, so they would just cancel each other out. You'll want to get rid of the herbivore with rad away before you take carnivore serum.
---
I can't remember what the effects for meat stew and squirrel stew are but if they are identical (ie they both give +1 str) they won't stack. SPECIAL enhancements only stack with aid from different  types. So you can get the +1 Cha from beer, liqour, food, drugs. But not from 4 beers. Now if meat stew and squirrel stew have different effects, you'll get both, and with Carnivore they both will be doubled.
---
Yeah, it was just my first one so I wanted to see what I could get (only level 11). Oh well there’ll be more.
---
Weird. It's about 4/5 of the time Snallygasters for me.
---
Yes, but I haven't checked for months.
---
No, only different buff sources stack, not buffs of the same type.
---
Yeppers!
---
Agreed 100%. I play fair and enjoy the game for what it is. I have an absolute blast! I play solo but this community is terrific and I’ve been thinking about maybe wanting to play on a team.
---
The main problem with Bethesda is their crutch is modders. Modders have not only fixed glaring issues that date back to mother forking OBLIVION (goo piles) but have expanded and improved upon just about every aspect of the game.
---
Bethesda has become so accustomed to someone else fixing their problems that they perhaps didn't even remember it was one when they conceptualized this game. Mods do make parts of the game much more palatable, but only on PC.
---
They quite literally don't have basic aspects of an online game such as text chat or a functional trade system. It's as if they thought "hell, we can just bolt some netcode on FO4 and kablammo... wads o' cash!"
---
Is Heart of the Swamp a guaranteed legendary? I've done it a decent amount of times where the boss mob that shows up is a crown enemy rather than starred.
---
Love that spot, have a nice veiw of Scorchbeast Queen nukes from there.
---
I've personally launched 2 in 1012 hours. 1 of them was in the first month and the second was last month :p
---
Hahah maybe
---
OK 👌 Thanks for that, I didn’t realise that 😊
---
Really depends on your build. 
---
For me none of those are really “magic”
---
But The first one sounds interesting enough imo.
---
maybe there was someone already in the room
---
It is similar to faschnat. But Grahm hosts a party for his favorite hoomans. We as players have to help get the party ready.
---
The bashing one and the 33VATS one are the 'magic' ones.
---
For them to work, you need to use them in VATS ('magic' shotguns don't work outside of VATS), and you need to be close enough to get 95% hit chance.  
---
Do that and you should 1-shot everything in the game apart from Sheepsquatch (both real and imposter) and the SBQ.
---
I need to know this! I thought she always said they were full.
---
&gt; Oh and the 25% off sale is back. Much better than mystery pick. 
---
Very true! But talk about setting a low bar ... mystery pick was, like the lottery, effectively a tax upon stupid players.
---
Oh ok 👌 Thanks for explaining all that, really appreciate it👍
---
Lol that’s awesome!!! I’ve got maybe 400ish hours in. I’ve spent so much time just exploring and building camps!
---
The new public teams system is actually a great feature I think. I play solo too, but the public teams seem almost anti socially chill lol. You'll end up at the same event and give each other a wave. It's cool for getting used to playing with other people at least and the benefits are nice. Haven't met any toxic people yet other than a few trap camps, but I generally laugh at them and move on. Glad you're enjoying it.
---
If you hit her quickly after she lands and are able to freeze her she stays on the ground for significantly longer allowing you to deal more damage easier
---
I cant remember all the ‘magic’ effects I know for sure junkies is one and bash damage is other. 
---
‘magic’ procs when using vats.
---
try hitting an enemy outside vats then hit the same enemy using vats. the shotgun the instakill the enemy while using vats is the ‘magic’ one.
---
Thank You for that insight 👍 I didn’t realise any of this so really appreciate you alerting me to it 😊
---
\&gt;be Bethesda
---
\&gt;be 2020
---
\&gt;still working despite the upheavals of Covid
---
\&gt;still do your best to get out content
---
\&gt;it has a few faults
---
\&gt;still gets complaints
---
I mean, Square-Enix have pushed their FFXIV content back by almost two months (which is why I'm here), and people generally understand the difficulties they're facing.
---
But fuck Bethesda because their games have a history of bugs.
---
Gotcha.
---
Kitten face
---
"Wow, such empty" ironic hahaha
---
You're glad pretty much every build is broken now? You sound nice. Let's be friends.
---
Was on my empty private server, so very unlikely, but good thought.
---
Don’t worry I sit on 200 of Those. 
---
Never really got anything exciting from them. 
---
But hey you wanna try it all right?
---
Huh, really? I have it maxed and absolutely totalled a couple of super mutant warlords with a single plasma grenade. Are they just that powerful that they don't need Demolition Expert? Or does it only apply to the explosive effect on weapons?
---
Time of day? My missus did it at night-time, no issues.
---
I have been using the bashing one with vats and it didnt seem to hit all the often, however, when using it outside of vats, it still consistently knocks everything in 1 hit almost all the time. It's strange that it seems to perform better outside of vats than in it.
---
It could be something to do with SPECIALs. My heavy gunner runs Unyielding. But I've never been unable to engage in dialog with an NPC/rent a room with no message indicating such.
---
Oh and the game is crashing like every 20 minutes. Bethesda going to Bethesda 💩
---
I always get at least 1 (sometimes 2)during the Defense waves.  Never the queen or grifftron monster...
---
Canned meat is only 5%.
---
And intelligence raises the xp you get too. So...
---
Clothing: shielded casual armour raises intelligence by 3.
---
Chems: berry mentats raise intelligence by 5 and normal mentats by 3.
---
Food: Brain bombs food raises intelligence by 3.
---
I used to get 48 intelligence regularly.
---
They have explained the stash limitation and scrap box over and over again. Engine errors.
---
The game play and loot is the same as 4, with improvements. Though, hit boxes and projectile speed are still wonky.
---
NMS is a fairly decent Co-OP build/exploration game. Kind of like Minecraft, but better and in space.
---
I'm not aware of a game that has an aesthetically "realistic" building mechanic like 4/76, but I've never cared for building until 76.
---
Speaking from my experience, I had carnivore and took a herbivore serum thinking that it would replace carnivore, but it didn’t do anything. I had to take rad away to loose carnivore (and a few others along the way) before I could get herbivore. Either way, you can still get the perks from the foods, it just won’t count as food when you eat it (such as when you eat squirrel stew with herbivore).  Though, I have read some people are having issues with this lately. 
---
A nice xp stack I like to use is cranberry relish, lovers embrace/kindred spirit, cranberry nuka cola if I have any, alongside the new public teams boosts.
---
Then we'all all be free!
---
But that’s not a tithe! A tithe would be 250!
---
Not just Bethesda that does this many other games do too, it isn’t required of you as a player to complete the season it’s something more to do in the back ground if you want to. If you miss a day you miss a day, not the end of the world.
---
I did ini edits for better gameplay also yet the water for me is either black or transparent. I chose transparent. I spoke to a modder on Nexus and he recomended a mod called HD water ( or similiar ) but that didn't help either. Transparent = disappear.
---
So I'm looking for a fix also - though there is not a lot of water in FO76. Yesterday I was on NW on Steam and Grafton dam water was transparent also yet my edits were on the Bethseda ini file.
---
You are actually 100% correct. Level 7 exactly. Strange number tbh
---
How do they know your a girl?
---
There is a mostly buried train car, set up as living quarters, (includes a cap stash and 3 star safe). It’s pretty cool. 
---
Under the transmission tower, slightly ne of Haven church.
---
Oh no, you have found my nocturnal drill!
---
Exactly, Bethesda has a history and yet after so many years they still manage to fuck up so much including their loyal fanbase.
---
How would anyone know you are female, before they join groupvoice?
---
I did that not too long ago.  I didn’t have to do a damn thing other than walk up.   It was nighttime.  Wait till night?  I’m assuming you’ve logged out and back in.  I’ve never been so committed to such a buggy game...
---
That's a rather large assumption you've made there.
---
My profile says im a girl and my gamertag is GothicBarbie25
---
&gt; Oh and the game is crashing like every 20 minutes
---
Maybe for you it is but certainly not me.
---
I have a camp near Vault 76. Cater to low level players. Sell plans/recipes/ammo 1cap each. No matter how rare it is. All access to plants, water, Brahmin and scrap bot. No walls just tents. One high level player came by and thank me for the service. He drop me some meds so I could but in my vending machine for free. I spend very little time at my camp. Mostly out exploring...
---
I am on PC.
---
My wife loves fallout.
---
Shouldn’t worry it’s the other people who have issues.
---
With how easy it is to be op in this game I highly doubt anyone doubted your ability cause you're a female .. maybe there was another reason, I know from my perspective I wouldn't care what your chemical makeup is .. as long as I see some op weapons or at least 1 or 2 bloodied people I'd be there
---
Soo rewards wise what do u get
---
Not an assumption. Because after I get on the mic. They go "oh you're a girl?" Why are you playing games? You should be out sucking d**k or something
---
this is the fo76 sub
---
Gud 4 u
---
My GT is GothicBarbie25 and it says on my profile I'm a girl
---
Cool, so I don’t have to tag along with them. I can just join then do my own thing?
---
There's been quite a few improvements since launch.
---
Its still got plenty of bugs (it is bethesda), but these are more the ones that are mildly annoying rather than the ones that crash you to desktop constantly.
---
The complaints about no humans/no NPC had been changed with the wastelanders update, there's now human NPCs
---
You cant really get griefed now.
---
QoL changes like more stash space etc.
---
Currently its half price on steam.
---
Million up votes for you
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Well that's just rude. If you're on PS4 (and setup to record last 30 mins of gameplay) save the video and report them. Might get them banned from PSN.
---
I'd say just rip the NW shit out of the challenges. Stop trying to force people to play a side mode that they hold no interest in.
---
Yeah I know.
---
I’m sure you can already imagine but it is a great investment if she sticks with it and continues to play for a while. Playing fallout 76 with my chick has been probably my most fun gaming experience ever. It’s just such a cool dynamic.
---
Y'all reckoning they do this shit on purpose, like FDev do with Elite Dangerous (which, right now, they are dry-bumming the playerbase without using lube, on purpose)?
---
Or maybe it's just so difficult to iron out every single little tiny detail in such a big game?
---
Just a thought.
---
Already has and stated emphatically that unyielding armor is still king.
---
It's sad how pathetic dudes are nowadays. They should grow up and show people respect. Little bitches
---
That sounds much better than the other team way. Not really into the talking to mic thing. So will be a lot better. Thanks.
---
Now that  is proper boss. 
---
I just usually stick road leathers, can of dog food, bottle of  beer, sawed-off double barrel shotgun, and  just one shotgun shell in the first overseers camp...
---
If you get pitch black water, bScreenSpaceReflections set to 1 in the fallout76prefs.ini should fix the issue. It doesn't do anything to FPS as far as I know since most reflections that kills fps are coming from the enlighten setting. (for me, at least.)
---
A good place I found to try the tweaks out is inside the penitentiary ... with enlighten on, I'm getting consistent fps drops in the jail cells area. Without it, I'm at 60. :d In fact, the fps boost was so big I was able to tweak the shadows up haha. About NW, most things can't be tweaked to avoid unfair advantages afaik.
---
I sell things for cheap, I leave my stuff unlocked. I am not stupid, I just have way more than I need. Why would I sell a weapon for 5 or 10k when I never have room under the caps limit for that much anyway? If someone drops by my camp and takes 14 lead... it won’t hurt me. That’s like 60 bullets, who cares? If someone takes some junk off my collection... good. I remember what it was like to have no water/food when I was first starting out.
---
Yeah, I saw a post yesterday, and a youtuber talk about it.  And unless you're paying close attention, I know I missed getting points and didn't remember how I got them.  So, I guess, kinda keep track of where you're at with points, and see if they add up later.
---
But, definitely make a report to Bethesda.  They might just give you the points, even if you earned them earlier.
---
My friend and i have started playing since it went on 50% sale on Steam. So far, it is actually really fun, and i dont see why the game has so much hate. We just found our first set of Power Armor, and tomorrow we’re gonna look for Fusion Cores
---
maybe it's a day/night cycle thing
---
Weird - I've definitely had events where I don't get a legendary. I always do it since it's pretty easy to do anyway.
---
You can have multiple food buffs active at the same time, but most buffs don’t stack. For example, you can’t stack Mole Rat Chunks and Deathclaw Steak because they both buff Strength. Eating one while the other is active cancels out the latter. Same goes for any  Endurance food buffs, Intelligence food buffs, etc.
---
Last time I checked, XP food buffs don’t stack either. So you can’t have Cranberry Cobbler and Cranberry Relish simultaneously active.
---
Melee Damage food buffs, however, do stack. And doing so can help you get up to some OP numbers, especially with Carnivore and Strange In Numbers.
---
Hope this helps. Happy gaming!
---
That's odd, cause in the few groups I'm in when lfg... i get very lil in response.  But when a woman asks,  40 people show up offering items n help.. lol
---
Absolutely.  It's not like you're in a committed relationship or will be meeting your soul mates or anything.  Another benefit: Free fast travel to their camps.
---
I'd love a buildable consumable that just gives the confetti effect.  
---
The XP bonus from the lunch boxes is great, but that honestly amused me so much more.  
---
Especially when something died way too close to me and the texture kept showing up on my gunbarrel.  
---
It was a hoot!
---
Typo under energy ammo. And cryo is misspelled, too. I guess we know Fallout 1st subs aren’t covering the costs to keep a proofreader on staff.
---
How exactly are you trying to do it? 
---
Map&gt;social&gt;public teams&gt;create team?
---
So I saw the Xbox Gamepass but and it has me wondering if this means xbox and windows store users can play together.
---
Haha and great, I’ll be on that this weekend. Thanks for the help
---
I would love to run into those sessions. I get told to go suck d**k and to be a stripper
---
Used to be able plant crops on campfire not sure if one can anymore.
---
&gt;Theres also phantom player camps showing on the map. They arent green, and arent yellow like an ally but a faded grey color and you cant fast travel to them. 
---
That's what happens when someone removes power from a vendor but leaves items assigned to it.
---
The mods for Xbox are pretty nice. A good many PC mods get ported over. Sony screwed their players, but modders have still done wonders with what they have to work with. The worst part about them on consoles is no mod manager, and very limited space. But then again...they are consoles.
---
I never paid for a single Bethesda game while I was on PC, and I'm glad that I didn't choose to play 76 on there judging by the problems that have went on with it. There's enough cheating and shit on consoles without third party software being an issue.
---
Text chat might be good for PC, but it would be shit for consoles. I'm personally glad they don't have it. Games like Warframe, Neverwinter, etc are extremely annoying with it on consoles.
---
I've debated on going back to PC gaming, but meh, the upkeep is tedious and expensive. The freedom was nice, but not really worth it.
---
Im on ps4,  no option to right click.
---
I haven't noticed, rarely use workshops unless its part of a daily. Good to have new fast travel points.
---
All i want is 100 308 rounds per trade in
---
On Xbox: holding the pause button/ tab over to public teams/ create a new team/ select what style I want. Then I get the notice that I’m not currently accepting team invites.
---
I’m showing online. I’m not in a private server. I haven’t served hopped recently. I haven’t blocked or muted anyone using the team menu.
---
Ya theres no date or time table attached to that statement. It took 2 hours to convert 4k .44, fucking insanity, you can only trade in 15 rounds at a time. It wont be a fix, they probably just remove the terminal and it will still be such a slow and dreadful process it wont be worth it. Once you learn your way around the terminal its not the terminal that makes it so slow but all the uneeded caps, only 2000 max ammo points, your trade in between only 10 - 50 rounds of ammo at a time. No mention of an Adrenaline fix, or how about vats sneak fix, or how about fix there fucking end game weapons that are broken, or how about the auto complete bug for challenges which made me loose a whole day of score points. Its literally like they had an intern program this shit with zero knowledge of the game. And obviously with all the broke  shit in the game they'rr like we'll fix the camp objects, fuck your camp objects, fix the fucking game already, quit adding new shit to a broken fucking game.
---
It's part of the reason I don't turn on my mic very often. I don't want to deal with shit because in my past experience, it's either been kids learning to swear for the first time, or taunting assholes. (Although, I've overheard plenty of kids getting yelled at by their moms which is always a good time. Until it's annoying.)
---
I'm on Xbox and have not really had an issue the handful of times I have turned on the mic in FO76. I have a naturally deeper voice sometimes, so that may help avoid the nonsense.
---
I'm sorry you have to deal with it.
---
Now I feel dumb. It's only you saying this that has made me realise I could have a second backpack and just swap.
---
What kind of museum are you building? I built a shovel museum. Had a lot of fun naming the shovels. Uncle Kleetuses Varmint Whacker, One Handled Turnip Flipper, and Biggus Diggus to make a few.
---
That is a positive for sure.
---
Hopefully we see this somewhat frequently.
---
It would be nice too see this a few times during the season. Because it is ludicrously unobtainable else.
---
&gt;	Sorry if this post isn’t allowed, the rules wouldn’t load for me, 
---
Yeah - no trading on this sub
---
Fair enough, sounds like a bug. 
---
Might be related to the bug that shows the "enter leaders" option on interiors as it sounds like the game erroneously thinks you're on a team when you aren't.
---
Or Charleston
---
oh .. sorry to hear that \*drops mic\*
---
but in any event if you can still get to the team display through social menu there might be options on your system if you can highlight you character's name
---
It’s a shame you’ve had an experience like that. I’ve seen nothing but kindness so far. No one has once called me out for being a girl and I have always ended up with full groups :/
---
There's such a huge disparity in the playerbase demographic, it blows my mind when I think about it. I mean you have a large playerbase of women and LGBTQ players, and then you have a massive amount of mysogynistic/homophobic users out there displaying it in their camps etc. A lot of people only view it as shock humor but still, never played a game as diverse of a playerbase as this one
---
The way you antagonize op later down in your conversation is disgusting and immature.
---
Act sarcastic and downvote all you want but crashing every 20 minutes is not something effecting the masses. You have something effecting your own game.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
You might be in for a surprise. 
---
A couple of times it let me travel and now when i try it now it says you cannot travel to a workshop i do not own.
---
Also sometimes even when you do own it it wont let you fast travel for free
---
Yeah I hopped on mic once because the team I jumped into was on theirs and another time to let my team know I had a Colossus on me so they could get in on it but other than that every team I've been in has been quiet. I can go either way but I'm only interested in chatting if it's gameplay stuff, for public teams anyway.
---
Heard this before 8000 times already. It's become meaningless. Support can't add score when this happens? What a broken thrown together piece of trash game. I'm so far past giving any benefit of the doubt or respect. People need to really start treating Bethesda the way they treat their customers. Too many people are too nice and act like the parent who gives their crying spoiled kid candy whenever they want it. Bethesda customers need to say enough and stop being nice. This fake "We are really trying and really care" BS needs to end. Money and greed is all Bethesda cares about. Their mediocre products and somehow loyal customers are just a means to an end. The ammo converter is a great example of a clueless company slapping together something that doesn't make sense just so it can be in the game. I wish a different gaming company owned Fallout. Bethesda doesn't deserve it.
---
Yeah I didnt notice yesterday bc I was all into this new game board type battlepass! But I noticed murphs place changed its icon and then I seen the big drill and Charleston landfill had new icons. I had to post
---
Good luck OP, maybe in a few months the dumpster fire will be waning.
---
Its a great gun overall but try it out in vats vs a sheepsquatch or anything tankier and take a look. There’s definitely a difference
---
One of my personal favorites. I’m puzzled by this one because I’ve actually logged out and dashboarded and restarted the console a few times and I’m still getting this message. Idk🤷‍♂️
---
Right I think most assume even a female character is actually a male irl. But I've never seen that level of sexism. I've come to learn in Nw I will always be  called dude, and that's why I don't feel like need to mic up
---
But the responders are extinct
---
If you want to do it again you can glitch through some doors to run the silo in like 5 minutes. Very fun if you want to do 3 SBQs quickly
---
That is not good news at all lololol, but I hope this gets reported and fixed just like adrenaline not working either
---
It is clearly not intended.        
---
        
---
If it was you would also be able to fast travel to nukezones+respawn in them.       
---
This happens because Public events run an auto spawn script which doesn’t distinguish safe spawning.        
---
         
---
You sound like one of the people that uses excavator PA at level 300 and wants everyone else to do the same.         
---
EDIT: You must be next level, plank of wood, stupid: to think Bethesda intended to force spawn people in nukezones.        
---
(Or really spiteful of other players?)
---
I visited Kiddie Corner Cabins at Level 50-60, then never again, not even for the daily...
---
Even when they fix this I'm pretty sure a B33 will one-shot most everything in the game
---
Limb damage, 30% vats hit chance, bashing damage.
---
Junkies. Medics and ( I think ) Instigating.
---
Yea I have had where they didnt spawn but they are far and few between...either way a shot at a mire outfit is not something I pass on.
---
Lol. I'm hoping they do and it's somehow just a glitch in coding.
---
Idk much about coding,but I understand things can get twisted easily with the simplest of things from what I've heard. You're probably right though.
---
Then again they should have a template or something similar for texts. That way the code of the said interface stays the same per text or something.
---
I'm just going to stop contemplating.
---
Oh muh glob.thank you!
---
If you want I can point you in the direction of a good discord group. I never have trouble finding a team in that group. PM me and i can send you their info.
---
Just did this today, amazing. 
---
Thanks for the fix.
---
Thank you so much for this info!
---
&gt;"We are going to make the ammo converter much more user friendly **as soon as we're able**"
---
Ok how many times have we heard similar things? I dont want to be that person but when they say vague things like "when we are able" or "we plan on.." etc then I roll my eyes now and expect nothing. I will die with my leg in the air if we see the rework anytime soon or for that matter ever. Theres numerous issues already that they "are aware of" that still have never been delivered on. I wont be holding my breath thats for sure.
---
Isnt xbox gamepass the equilvelent of psplus monthly free games?
---
To get the truck bed or mine car planters you have to purchase the settlers/raiders content pack and it’s not found in the atom shop.  I’m on PS4 and got mine from the PSN store.
---
I’m pretty sure there’s a perk card which slows down the rate the go down by.  Can’t think of its name at the mo tho.
---
Edit -  it’s called power user but just checked and it’s at level 50 I’m afraid
---
But does it spin?!
---
Because fo76 is basically a f2p game with a price tag
---
Just click X and it will give you the option to leave team.
---
The answer I'm looking for, thanks mate!
---
I hope its about life outside after the war, as if it were a fallout game
---
All you need to do is kill 159,236 lvl 68 super mutants and you’ve hit lvl 100 congrats
---
It's all on purpose, this whole score system wants one thing and thats selling atoms. 
---
Giving players score for completing events would actually make people complete it, as they now have a solid way to spend time and progress at a reasonable pace.
---
This is not a act of goodwill or content for your enjoyment, this is yet another cheesy way for them to earn more money for bareboned content.
---
Timegate after timegate, bug after bug, delay after delay, excuse after excuse. I wonder when some of you will wake up from this nightmare called Bethesda or whoever is in charge of fallouts development or investors that's forcing them to do this. 
---
Do i need to remind you that this is a full priced game, with both a subscription based model and a overpriced MTX store? 
---
Do i need to remind you that they take away earnable atoms so they can sell more atoms for score skips and atom store skins? 
---
For what exactly, the anual small content pack? 
---
Or the reskinned repeated events?

If you enjoy the game thats fine, but stop beeing so blind to what they are doing. They don't care about you or whoever reads this, they only want your wallet for Atom sales. 
---
Developers need a source of financial gain and i support developers that do it right, i don't mind spending money on a few skins or what have you. 
---
But first they need to show that what they offer is worth a players time and money and most of all enjoyment.
---
I'm done ranting, if you don't see the problem you never will.
---
My personal #1 rule while running a vendor, TIE THEM ALL TO A SWITCH! That way you can turn them "off" when youre at max caps. It'll keep your vendors from showing up on the map so you don't attract people when you don't want to sell. 
---
I sell almost exclusively 2-3* legendary weapon/armor. Typically nothing under 3k(except for some armor pieces) and upwards of 8k. Sales go through spurts. Might go a day or two with little to no sales then someone will buy a few pieces and max me out. I can switch off my vendors and lock up the area so I can keep playing without sacrificing a bunch of caps to Todd.
---
DO NOT sell 40 fasnacht masks. Or add garbage weapons/armor/clothing to your vendors just to bump up numbers. That's very irritating.
---
Legendary weapons/armor, rare clothing, canned dog food, meds(I'd imagine for the junkies out there), ammo, non-mounted head plans. 
---
Open water purifiers, food. If your camp is on a resource, it's up to you if you want to lock that up. I personally take everything I can if it's not locked haha.
---
Snallygasters also spawn all over the southern Charleston area
---
I know this an inconvent way to view it but this is the only way i can get the image https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/nigh7s7rike/screenshot/17474602
---
They can also drop as reward from your allies in your camp
---
AT is a good guy, it's all to little to late
---
Should be a season 2 reward! Maybe even include the bloody mess dismemberment for fun
---
I remember buying Power Armor from you. You had a great deal and we had a casual conversation- not everyone is like that. Sure, there are assholes out there, but I think they’re in the minority. I’m sorry you had that experience.
---
I’m nearing level 200 and have still not launched a nuke
---
The math everyone loves to do to claim this season is "impossible to complete" ALWAYS leaves out the events SCORE. Just do a few events a day along with your dailies and youll be zooming through the board in no time.
---
I’m still in currently so I’d say no but you never know with PSN 🙈
---
I've been playing since BETA and I still don't know when they trigger, or even what the hell they do to the area. I'm going to assume it randomly picks one of the biomes and starts a verdant season for a bit.
---
BTW if you need ingredients for Formula P, equip Green Thumb and head to the roof gardens of  Lewisburg as well as Abandoned Mineshaft 1 (around the rim of the main pit) for Ash Roses. Bloodleaf is easy enough to come by (most rivers and lakes have a few), Kaleidopore flowers are found in the Arktos Pharma biome labs.
---
They reduced the frequency at which the voice lines trigger with the Wastelanders update, but if you're not using the silent version and you're not hearing the lines upon entering the armor, it might be a bug.
---
I started yesterday with a friend too, but after playing Fallout 4, im pretty well versed in the game. I decided to keep a hunting rifle, constantly upgrading it, so now i can usually one shot enemies with a sneak attack from a distance
---
ooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
offffff
---
Thanks! I’ll give the public teams a go then. I’m usually just too shy to try meeting new folks but I know I’d really enjoy a team. I’ll just bite the bullet and give it a whirl!
---
This now confirms that Fallout now requires DAILY play (as apposed to allowing the same progression for people who can play in big chunks every so often) to achieve the rarest items/best rewards. 
---
Isn't that an issue when it comes to things like gaming addiction? People with those pre-dispositions will be (irrationally) scared of missing the dailys in fear of missing out on the high rank rewards.
---
Don't get me wrong, I've been playing daily for a while now (after a long break to play other games), but it strikes me as something that could be a problem similar to the gambling issues with loot boxes in other games.
---
Edited to ask if anyone knows of similar games with daily play requirements and no chance to make up the difference an achieve the same rewards if you miss a few days?
---
Holy crap, that’s awesome! Thank you so much for the tip!
---
So I used it the first time today. Converted like 60 40mm grenades to points and then used the points to buy fusion cells.
---
Things wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to go back like 100 times to get out of thy terminal... It seems the game had to go through all the steps I did in reverse order to take me out of terminal view. Almost threw my controller against the wall... 😑
---
It's always a level 10 for me, what level are you?
---
Yeah but the devs sure as shit care a whole lot more about money than they do the community, if they were to invest some of that money into shit that doesn't involve lining their pockets this game would be great
---
Right? I barely make 10k xp per day. I guess that's what I get for trying to enjoy the game rather than doing mindless grinding and min/maxing.
---
I enjoyed the build up though! I think that’s why it was so satisfying ☺️
---
I am just going to say. This sucks, but it's what makes open world games with Strangers fun. You can have bad encounters and amazing encounters.
---
There is a perk card-- Power User, I believe, that makes them last 30% longer per level of the card.
---
I farm the fusion core generators at Monongah and Thunder Mountain workshops. (Monongah is easier enemy-wise.) I also find spawns at the generators in the world-- two spawn in generators at Camden Park, for example.
---
My biggest solution is that I just don't use Power Armor except for Nuke Zones,   anywhere I'm in water, and Nuke Silos. I conserve as best I can.
---
Best way at that level is to hit up known spawns for PA frames and steal the cores out of there.(prison yard, shed outside of damn) It's been awhile since I was farming on that side of the map but I know the generator in the map has a spawn point for a fusion core.
---
I see one every time I look in the mirror. My anti social ass lol but we got public teams now! If only people used mic's
---
Oh give it a whirl! It’s super fun. I enjoyed it more than I thought. The room where you launch it looks really cool! It was just really neat seeing something new after all this time ☺️
---
Snallys are also frequently the enemy spawn at Kiddie Corner Cabins where you go get the Operation Tidy mission. Its usually either those or Radscorpions
---
Funny. I remember joining the Responders in the first 10 min of the game. 
---
They litterally have open enrollment
---
Win every round.
---
Wait, so the higher your INT is, the more XP you gain? Think I need to change my build around lol been trying to bulk up my XP quicker
