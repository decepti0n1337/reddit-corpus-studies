Ok so the shotguns damage is fine as it is they need a slight buff to their effective range because as of now they have little more than a melee weapon they should also add a triple barrel pipe shotgun for those pipe gun builds. Pistols on the other hand need a lot more love in the form of weapon mods, most importantly silencers and receivers for semi and full auto ammo types they also should add some new pistols like a very modable combat pistol like the combat rifle and sg, they should also add something like a .50 Cal desert eagle for end game pistol users.

---
Because this is misleading. Article only talks about private servers.
---
You want a fixer. 
---

---
If you cant find one then Handmade.
---
But, a botox lip attack would be awesome!
---
As a female-sounding human who's often on mic, I can say honestly that it's rare that people who show up and drop legendaries have turned out to be creepers. That's more commonly seemed to be guys who try to kill low levels on pacifist with splash damage or etc. &amp; assume inaccurately that I don't have an alt ;)
---
Is the optimal armor for this, Unyielding/Sneak? I'd prefer not to have to share. 
---
Also, Fixer vs Handmade. What's the difference?
---
Thanks man!
---
There isnt shit to do in this game except farm and kill people.  Not a difficult concept to fathom.
---
Well the community has to be welcoming when the game sucks lol, the community is the only thing this game has going for it.
---
That looks nice! Take my upvote for the idea, I love it!
---
Exactly.
---
this dude games
---
My crew had to kick a guy because of this very same behavior with a female Team Member. The drama was, unbelievable...from a 40yo man.
---
It's really strange, and theres still the issue with clicking on Perk cards that they broke 8 or 9 months ago.
---
I read somewhere that radrat have the same DR as super mutant. That explain a lot why there're no radcat D:
---
honestly having a second account opens up the game.
---
Want to sell that poor glitched thing?
---
i was just trying to look up if there was a clean truck and i did forget about those thanks!
---
This is why I dont camp in whitespring.
---
Its the second most popular place to nuke.  Why would you build your camp there?
---
Level 13 and already doubting?   This might not be your game.  :(. Hope it changes for you.
---
im not sure but the latest is march im pretty sure they said it would be next years Q1 (1st quarter) so not a set date yet
---
All but excavator, I believe. I didn't get that one, but I got the Shadow Prime and that's the case: all but excavator.
---
On PC for Rifles it seems like everyone has the BE/15reload Fixer and before legendary Fixers it was the BE agility Handmade
---
If you usr stabilized, then you dont need AA. Otherwise AA.
---
Cool idea. My one dislike would be that it's light on fine details (small objects and clusters). I suspect this is due to the nature of the build, as it seemed like you're using a lot of structural pieces. Foundations and roofs tend to eat right through budget. 
---
On that note, I'm curious how much budget you have left since you mentioned a few spaces you're still working on.
---
Dont feel like its inhuman the guy is basically being toxic ans ruining your fun, soon as you block him and play you'll feel better for it
---
Sounds terrible, don't be too nice! Not saying retaliate or engage, for heaven's sake block him. Just don't let anyone push you this far in the first place. 
---
Definitely the right move to branch out, the majority of the players are at least cool if not awesome. There is always bad apples...
---
&gt; Not really. One of the guys we played with swears by a lever-action vats rifle build but, said the damage vs the SBQ is terrible
---
I'm not that guy, but can confirm: a LAR VATS build with a sniping/stealth component absolutely crushes everything PvE in this game *except* big boss style fights. 
---
For those, bring a faster-firing gun (I use a Furious Explosive rifle).
---
Just West of ATLAS Observatory is a chunk of a tug boat ding ding
---
also since youve been playing since beta what do you do to keep the game fresh like me and my gf play it together and im not even close to being bored of it but whats some fun shit to do after you launch the nuke
---
Right? By the time I get to that final cavern, my ammo is depleted, no matter how much I carry. I've tried a few times now and it's doing my banana. 
---
Might have to wait till I'm a bit higher than Lvl 54.
---
Lol....Lil boy.
---
250lb bench press club here pal. But I guess at 160lbs that's probably little compared to your fat ass.
---
Got a job....my own business, and my own house, 6-pack abs and can afford to pony up $12 a month for a private server if me and my Bros want to spend 8 hours server hopping and cheesing the end boss in a game so we can collect virtual tokens.
---
You're the one who posted on my comment because you were butt hurt because I called out dupers cheesing the queen. You liberals are a bunch of whiny little bitches.
---
Unyielding sneak is optimal, but not always required with 15 agility &amp; the sneak perk. Generally I can't be seen before I kill them, only larger mobs that generally find you. I prefer to run sentinel.
---
 Also the shadowed mod on armor does the same as sneak armor, but it does lower your Dr &amp; er.
---
A ffr fixer does more damage&amp; has more dps, but more reloads, so you have to weigh that up &amp; a bloodied ffr fixer is harder to get your hands on. If I get one from the purveyor I'd use it, but I wouldn't bother trading for one as my handmade is doing just fine &amp; fixers are way overpriced.
---
Oof yeah. I havnt tried in awhile. I'm just over 100 with some better gear so I'll give it another shot. Getting tired of just daily's lol.
---
And what’s funny is it has nothing to do with being in a private or public world.
---
Seems to me you've made the appropriate amount of effort to reconcile the situation. 
---
This isn't about your actions and it's that mentality that means the cycle won't stop until you stop it.
---
And don't buy into any empty apology. Dude is toxic. Remove and enjoy gaming again.
---
Peace.
---
This game has promised a lot, and has, for a long time, failed to deliver on that promise.  
---
I'm hoping "Wastelanders" finally brings something to the table.
---
As a former PA Heavy gunner, I would take the AA over the Hunters.
---
Exactly... which is why I rarely spend Atom on cosmetics that consume camp budget. They are a waste of Atom. For months, I couldn't even buy Atom shop CAMP cosmetics until they dropped the distillery and expanded our camp budget. Until Bethesda understands this fundamental problem with Atomic shop CAMP cosmetics, they'll never figure out how to properly sell items in the Atomic Shop. Worse, for those of us with 99.9999% maxed out camp budgets, new Atom shop items are useless. Bethesda needs to wise up and figure out a way to expand our camp budget the amount of each Atomic Shop item we spend Atom on. They also need to periodically iterate through everyone's camp budget and clean up orphaned items still consuming budget... like all of those missing turrets.
---
Don't AA and Stabilized stack?
---
[removed]
---
Camp building is for sure my favorite thing. I finally caved and made an alt just to build at a specific spot. It's a pretty sweet little museum-like setup. Includes a time machine and a secret entrance into my underground train car home/vending area.
---
Would be great if we could bulk ammo or break it down to rebuild into other ammo.
---
Nearly everyone I've met has been a gem!
---
They do, but not 100.  
---
The weapon perk gives you 50%.  The Stabilized perk gives you 45%, but your overall AA with both ends up being 72.5%.
---
So its still worth it.  Especially on the Queen whom has a static 70% DR/ER from everything.
---
But how would I hide the siren on my buddy’s roof and then hear him curse over and over??
---
Ugh I'm sorry that happened to her as well. I don't understand why it's so hard to hear, "I want to do this for myself!"
---
that sounds fucking awesome i want to see that  but yeah thats been alot of what me and her do on here and the challanges
---
This is good.  Taking pictures of mounted cat heads seems harder to fix.
---
Isn't the mothman buff one hour, serious question here?  I know for me it is about 15 minutes tops so I've never paid too much attention.  I server hop a lot and I have never retained the buff on a hop, ever, unlike all the other buffs.  Also wondering if that's the case for everyone else or just me? Seems odd that all other buffs carry over but not that one.
---
Normally you would yes. But specifically vs the Queen, the 30% damage boost + The prime is quite noticeable. Couple that with stabilized and your gun is doing quite a lot of damage to her.
---
I should have looked for advice sooner. I kept thinking this is just something that comes with sharing digital space with ppl and kept trying to make it work.
---
Just keep exploring new places; respect the area levels
---
Don’t forget “no camp placement restrictions” cause I’ll build a settlement in Prickett’s Fort like there’s no tomorrow
---
I’ve been losing legendary scorchbeasts often. They just vanish into thin air
---
Or, just make all Atomic Shop purchases have contribute zero toward your budget. I mean, I'd love to have the Slocum's Joe sign in my camp, but after seeing how much budget my Nuka-Cola sign eats up (even the small one), they can forget that sale. They are actively missing out on sales because of this.
---
I love my greenhouse but I don't use it because it's too much for my current budget.
---
At that point why dont we have swole rad rats?
---
I have a Primed AAE.
---
It does more damage with Stabilized than Without. 
---
For max damage on the queen, you want the AA and Stabilized both up, it makes a difference. 
---
On anything other than the Queen Stabilized is not worth it, but for SBQ, you want stabilized.
---
also where is the clean truck im looking for it now is it the store?
---
Makes a little more sense...thanks
---
That's also why if you've just transferred an item from your character to your stash and within 1-5 minutes the entire server crashes... well, you've lost those item(s). Bethesda used to have their caching engine (Redis or Cassandra or Memcached or whatever) persist so nothing was lost. Now it doesn't persist. Thanks to the dupers who took advantage of FO76's database rollback mechanism, Bethesda undid rollbacks as an "anti-duping measure". Instead, they now drop anything in the cache on the floor when a server crashes. Found a great Two Shot Legendary weapon or maybe that hard to find Red Asylum outfit and stashed it? Then 20 seconds after transferring it the server crashes? Say buh-bye to those items. They won't be in the stash or on your character thanks to this "updated" cache drop design. Who would **ever** design software to intentionally lose data? Yeah, well you guessed it... that would be Bethesda.
---
Yeah, on the rug I think? And yeah dude, the spot turned out better than i thought I'd be able to do. Budget is pretty much maxed though. If you're on ps4, I'll gladly show you.

I'd happily pay for a sub if I had unlimited building potential
---
Because when we all came out of the vault, there were no factions.  West Virginia was a wasteland of plague carrying scorched and was shut off from the rest of the world to prevent it from spreading.
---
We came into an empty wasteland with no factions currently occupying the land, so there was no need to add in factions that dont yet exist on this peice of land.
---
Wastelanders is going to introduce them, because people came back with factions, so they will be viable.
---
nah im on xbox to bad though but does it spawn there every time or somtimes cause i sever hopped a few times
---
It is very much worth the price. 
---
The hatred you saw was blown out of proportion, it was a vocal minority spurred on by youtube campaigns attemping to bring down Bethesda.
---
Even if you only spend a few hours in game, you can buy fallout for less than 10 bucks now, and that is cheaper than going to see Joker.
---
Block out the negative hype. It’s just easy press and easy views for news channels. 
---
Dive in and enjoy the game. 
---
I did, and I haven’t looked back. I’m having the most fun on a game in a long damn time. 
---
Give it a shot, I’m pretty sure it’s on sale too. 
---
You should be able to grab it for roughly 20$ online.
---
Cheers mate !
---
Also, one of the best friendly community’s I’ve seen in game.
---
Agreed. However, to at least get some use out of some of those few items that I have bought, I created a brand new character and have them use those items in their camp. I can't use them on my primary character. I also agree that Atom shop items should consume 0 camp budget. Even worse, items like the bulb letters consume not only camp budget per letter, it's considered a 'light'. You can only have 50 lights in your camp max. This means a maximum of 50 letters. The stupidity of this restriction is that the bulb letters neither act as illumination sources nor are they even under the lights category. They show up under 'wall decor'. Why Bethesda categorized the bulb letters as "lights" when they aren't, I'll never know.
---
What are you doing with your gear ?  Lol
---
Id like to see the ability to upgrade your camp and increase things like build size and built limit. I also wouldnt mind an area where players can build together. Create towns and such. I also think being able to use the vertibird drones that are flying around as a means of cross map travel would be neat.
---
I'd love it if people tried this with me more often.  It's tough to get in a dust up these days :(  
---
Where are all these players when I'm on? :)
---
Are you on PS4, I have 3 characters with trap bases and been killing and eating people since the start I can help and you can you some ideas from my camps...
---
I've been playing the game pretty regularly since it came out last year.  I'm now a level 115 I think and only just now getting to the point where I'm slowing my game time.  There is a lot to do in the game if you pace your self and dont shoot up heroin and play it non-stop for an entire week.  Hell, I still haven't even launched a nuke yet.
---
Buy it, check it out and enjoy it.  There is a lot to do in the game to include building a massive camp (if you so choose).  That's mostly what I'm doing now until more content comes out, trying to gather material to build a nice camp.
---
July 25th.
---
No idea currently I can't even log into the game since my ps+ is dead. I hope that Bethesda will allows account portability but I press X. I still have some nice shit outfit and love my two char. If they do a free weekend after Wastlanders, when we'll be sure there not working on anything about cross-platform, I'll probably give it.
---
yeah that's an odd one buddy.  I guess, congrats on the bug! :P
---
That I couldn't tell you. I might have gotten lucky, but that was for sure where I found it.
---
i have a question..do you physically have to move the camp to get the bigger limit as you level or is the camp already adjusted...
---
My thought is looking no so far back, kids had more freedom to explore their world and even *heaven forbid* gain benefits from fellowship with their elders, family, family friends and even strangers. 
---
But with today's stranger danger, that has some merits regarding personal safety I do understand, society has swung so far in one direction that anyone over a certain age (only men really) are now suspected of the worst crime imaginable, with no reason to and no evidence. Just seems sad how cynical and accusational we have become. 
---
Gained so much and lost so much also.
---
Appreciate the love!
---
This was my situation as well and unfortunately Slocum’s Joe didn’t make the budget cuts. There is zero point of buying new camp items when I can’t even place what I’ve already bought. I’m not taking down one paid item to put up a new paid item.
---
Wastlanders new boss will be a SRK Swole Radrat King. D:
---
for stealth imo use unyielding for the +15 agi bonus.  You can even stealth the Whitesprings clubhouse if you know how to approach it.
---
As for weapons, handmade and fixer are the meta though plenty of other guns work fine thanks to how strong bloodied damage is in general.
---
That is, unfortunately, the nature of most online game.  Any changes you make will get in the way of changes someone else makes.
---
Most companies are not ready to embrace the Minecraft/EverquestNext Landmark stuff.
---
So, you get what is basically a static themepark with rides to go on.  Its a popular paradigm even though the only company that's been able to do it with any longevity is WoW.
---
Sorry xbox! Good luck with the next haul!
---
Your a good guy so many godroll and legacys are out of loop with people just leaving, hopefully player pollution rise with wastelanders and many of those people come back
---
thhays alright. and thanks!
---
coming soon for fallout 1st members!  Good idea though :)
---
But you can still die if your team makes someone hostile to you.
---
Yeah I understand. One reason I don't have much is because I want my friends to customize some of the homes as their own. I would say I have around 8-10% budget left? Something like that. I didn't want to take it all up. I do have plans if I start to run out
---
1) Get rid of fridge (I dont really even use it)
---
2) Remove outside walls (I want the security but this is not in a dangerous spot)
---
3) Remove the outside garden (I forgot to show it, but there is a small one, I dont use it but want it to give the vibe of reconstruction)
---
Thank you for your ideas!
---
PS4 player here and yes big time makes me wonder with new and many old bugs since the start if they will even be able to implement wastelanders into the game at all. I still love the game and hopefully I'm wrong
---
Another thing people fail to realize.   The "kids" who grew up playing Atari and Nintendo are now in their 40s and 50s.   And still game.
---
So that 45 year old dude playing fallout with your 13 year old is not trying to get in his pants.   Hes probably nostalgic for the time he was 13 and just seeing his first virtual world to explore.
---
Once a gamer, always a gamer.  It has no age.

According to The FO76 damage calculator the Hunters 
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) 
---
This is not factoring in the Crit bonus since it is not in the calculator
---
Yeak ikr. I was lucky with my melee to get quickly a full UNY and bloodied/junky. On my commando I got a Bloodied 10mm and recently a Bloodied auto pipe on a commando vats stealth build, my last days with it were dope. Took me some time to rebuild this character from a shitty rifleman to an op commando. Even if there're nothing compared to a 3* Fixer/Handmade it still do the job while you grind those OP godroll weapons.
---
nope, none of that will flag you for pvp on it's own so long as you have pacifist enabled.
---
you should be able to stick in another nuke card and enter the code again.  
---
Always take at least 2 cards with you.  
---
I learned this lesson the hard way too.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you need to go grab one from your stash, leave your buddy in the silo, you dont have to complete it again, you can just fast travel out, pick up a card, then run back in to the launch terminal, give your buddy the card, and he should be able to enter it again.
---
they fixed that, electrically charged and similar no longer flags for pvp.
---
The ultimate resolution to the debate of egoism vs altruism was never expected to happen in a Reddit video game forum, and yet... I have hope you two will solve it!
---
Yeah, my initial and still current want of this game is Fallout Minecraft.  All I really want is persistent worlds (servers) where people can build anywhere without restrictions.  Each world would evolve and reshape over time as people rebuilt cities and conquered the wasteland.  People could be good or evil about it.  For example, you could nuke a city and basically level it, although there might be anti-nuke equipment that could be built or active faction battles to stop the evil players from trying to launch one.  There could be creep spawns and aggroing based on building sizes/value, so larger cities would get bombarded by the waste and need to defend their settlements.  There could be active raids against major creep encampments to generate temporary reprieve, or ignoring creep settlements could have them grow over time and make the attacks worse (think like playing Starcraft against AI or something like that where the enemy can grow, search, and attack).
---
The cities also need professions.  People have to be able to choose their roles like adventurer, trader, shopkeep, bandit, etc.  There could be active factions you pledge loyalty to, and those factions can be in a constant state of flux based on what the players do in the game.  There could be alliances or fierce rivalry based on an aggregate reputation point system that changes over time due to player behavior.  There could be NPC quests set up for the cities and factions to continuously provide activities for resource caches, raids, or hunting for special weapons or temporary bonuses.  The factions could have lore fitting quests that drive each faction's natural tendencies and conferentation.  Each quest would have reputation increase/decreases with the other factions.  The reputation could even drive the available quest options from general peace to all out war.
---
The hardest part for me about FO76 is that it really didn't do much of anything with the whole online, multiplayer system.  There's such miniscule development towards this end, and it doesn't embrace the core concept.  We have minigames, of a sense, but that's about it.  The whole thing can be so much more.  Just a small amount of background work needs to be done to make it happen.
---
kudos!
---
Feels great, doesn’t it? :)
---
I have the same problem with my comedy club. I don't have as much seating as I would like and I just got that bar set in the atom shop so I'm wondering how I'm going to fit that in.

interesting. thnx.

found it. it took a couple of hops but i got it thanks so much

You'll find less players on PC, but it does run smoother than PS4 depending on your rig.
---
clan owned towns!
---
faction base towns
---
ififhsjsocjfjneje gf

i got the paint and i got the clock threw my gf she knew the plans but not the billboards. atomic shop?
---
U know u only got skins?
---
Make private servers different building rules and no building area limits or height limits.

What does the title and the body have to do with each other? Clickbait

Just wish I could hit that Bffr roll on a level. With mutations, nerd rage, radicool... I dont see how it wouldn't hit hard like a truck.
---
Was this on Xbox?
---
No ps4
---
Sweet. Glad to help. 👍
---
Do you play on PS4?
---
Includes outfit skins vault boy head and posters, says it in the description
---
I am on pc so that’s be great, thanks
---
You can never find that many without playing with your friends
---
Probably the second good idea I've seen on Reddit this last year, honestly a cool idea instead of some minor nitpicky bullshit like most posts here.
---
Did you get strangler PA from standard runs or only expert?
---
You have the craft some at work bench.
---
If that's happening, then just go through the menus and switch yourself to non-pacifist. Take that as a penalty for your team being a) Dumb and b) Not grieving other people with the way you suggest those mechanics be changed.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I was wondering if they got to that yet or not. Its been a bit since ive been griefed.
---
Good job! I waited forever to do my first one, because I heard what a timesink and ammo guzzler it was. Wasn't as bad as I thought (granted I was level 107 by then), but still tooka solid hour. Did it a second time about 30 levels later with a random. I think solo is the way to go, just for the fulfillment of it.
---
In PvP there is a damage cap of 110 per shot, so stealth commando is good, but bloodied is bad. You can still run that build, just get to full health before you get into PvP, there’s no point in making yourself that vulnerable if you’re not getting the extra damage.
---
Anything that tells on your dying first to activate is a generally bad idea. In all games. Possible exception (Not relevant to F76) for tank skills that keep you alive for a few seconds after your health hits 0 and gives your hair a chance to heal you to full or else you die proper.
---
We should have a camp the size of spectacle island in Fallout 4.that is a huge peice of land big enough for a small town.
---
New number.  Who dis?
---
Griefers have ruined it for everyone. I never accept random invites
---
So would stealth commando still be pretty good for pve? I’m looking for a build that can switch Without having to change perks between pvp and pve
---
They’re not at the work bench, I said that in the post
---
She did good by me. I got a junkies explosive gatling gun and a bolstering sentinel left right leg. The leg is light combat armor though.
---
That's an odd one, and one that will likely require a customer support ticket to handle with any measure of success.
---
Though, I do have to ask; do you play with any UI mods? If so, they may be causing the error. I'll assume not and refer you to my first advice, though.
---
This is so.
---
They are the only thing that still concerns me to fight.
---
Never had anything good in over a year
---
People might want to understand what others have to say. Possibly prepare for other, new settlers coming into the area.
---
Yes. I run a full health stealth commando and it’s great. Will you solo a SBQ? Probably not, but you’ll still annihilate everything else. It’s the stealth that gives the build power, bloodied just takes it over the top. Very few enemies you encounter have over 1000 health. Most things will be dead in 1 trigger pull with or without it.
---
 Check out the CAMP I built. Its supposed to be like a small city [https://youtu.be/1NiU30l9RuY](https://youtu.be/1NiU30l9RuY)
---
Ok thanks for the input, I hope one day to at least do a full team on it that would be pretty cool
---
Ya I think so.  Not sure if they are still in there,
---
Wolves do not last long at all. They have *very* low HP. You need to get yourself a deathclaw or yao guai.
---
The outfit skins and the head u should find in an armor workbench. The posters when you are in build mode. Try restarting the game if they are not there.
---
Hi 5 fellow idiot. :D
---
I’ve gotten a few great weapons. Especially on private servers. Never won the lottery
---
Many people don't accept random invites. Too many kids wanting you to power level them or help them with a quest. You should at least shoot a message OP
---
Not gonna stop. The settlements are probably going to be protected.
---
Outfits. In armor bench.
---
Generally agree with lovestopuck.
---
I’m almost always overencumbered and cannot fast travel anyway...
---
Yea join a rando, then they can see your camp, start pvp with their friend, makes you hostile, then they destroy your camp
---
Everyone loves bonus XP and free fast travel. Nobody loves randoms fucking up their camp or otherwise acting with malicious intent. I personally accept random invites most of the time, because most of the time people aren’t acting with malicious intent. But the few who do can really put a damper on the festivities.
---
👀🤣
---
I’ve grieved Re installing it and checking and it’s still not in there. Nothing new in the crafting workbench’s
---
&gt;dont shoot up heroin and play it non-stop for an entire week
---
Don't tell me how to live my life
---
&gt; The game is about rebuilding the world yet we're severely limited on what we can actually do. I have so many unique ideas, but I can only build half of what I hoped.
---
[This is a Bethesda server](https://i.imgur.com/XHxnc9s.jpg)

Nice, had a similar experience just around the same time on Xbox
---
So you get 1 point or perk to share per 3 points in Charisma.  The most likely culprit is ‘blight’. -1 to all stats.  Usually boils down to a disease or addiction.
---
Not. In there.
---
That was my first CAMP location ever.. pile of wood nearby, two radstag bodies for carry weight food, alcohol spawns on the steps and by the raft, fishingpole screws, explosive box often had good stuff, random encounter up on the tracks about it to check all the time, natural animal spawn location right outside the camp for chickens, squirrel, and frog, neat heads on sticks and bodies on pikes gives it that Raider feel.

I'm just saying that it's possible they've changed tact since the blowback over 1sts launch
---
Define griefers please, don't know what everyone is talking about
---
I'm okay with less players. Maybe it'll become a bit shitty for events like encrypted, but discord is way more accessible on PC than ps4 community stuff.
---
Plus, if I can glitch in peace without some people peaking on me while I go through some walls to explore not playable areas... &lt;.&lt;
---
Joke aside, it's also a good point for doing instances without a high level respawning all the npc D:
---
For some reason one of my three characters got reeeaally good weapons from here while my other two just getting weapons to scrip.
---
Hmm I’ll look into this thanks!
---
the game is boring now ... unless you get excited by a turkey outfit for almost $10 .... what a damn joke
---
You do realize us playing 76 is just a vault experiment right?
---
How would I have known that, fair enough though, hope you get it sorted out.
---
Mod devs seem to stop bothering once Bethesda have taken up their idea and probably work, can't say I'd blame them tbh.
---
So good. Hilarious
---
You’ll probably have to wait for Bethesda to make a non-shitty game engine that can handle that amount of player objects
---
It's ok. 
---
There are some very glaring flaws with the game (bugs upon bugs, Atomic Shop BS, Fallout 1st, some weapon types being flat out bad) along with some questionable actions and issue prioritization from Bethesda (spitballing game modes to see if any fit, delaying the update that would put NPCs in the game to push out the aforementioned Fallout 1st).
---
That being said, I've played it off and on for a while because I do enjoy the Fallout universe and like exploring and being a part of it. I think it's worth the $10ish price tag you can get it for now but I'd be hesitant about paying much more than that because it still feels unfinished to me.
---
LOL, I've never played the pip boy games, will have to try them, have a few.
---
1st sure has changed the vending landscape and adventure as a whole, servers seem quiet and vending machines sparse except for the same old plans and clothing.
---
My current is all sentinel assassin combat with one metal piece but im currently at 564 ER which is what im trying to go for. Higher Er against teslas lol. But im at a sad 336 dr
---
I’m sorry for all the hassle. One of the reasons I really wished 76 was a single player game, but I’ve come to appreciate the online components. Absolutely block this guy like the others said. I’d love to come and kick his ass for you — we girls need to look out for each other!!
---
Check the atom shop, you might need to claim them.
---
This is why I don't
---
I came to a few yesterday that were selling regular gear for 500 to 2k caps. And everything else that was basic was expensive too. Don't get people like that, your never going to make caps that way
---
&gt;Hes probably nostalgic for the time he was 13 and just seeing his first virtual world to explore.
---
So much this, one can't help looking back at one's childhood sometimes and try to relive that innocent wonder of the world vicariously through kids, it is understandable.
---
Eww. It's best if you just don't think about it.
---
Especially after you turn that hard earned stable flux into a serum, that you then ingest.
---
&gt;The "kids" who grew up playing Atari and Nintendo are now in their 40s and 50s.   And still game.
---
Scary to think of really, time and life goes by so fast, a cliche but true enough.
---
Is this hard to set up if you’re not a tech nerd?
---
Yes! I've been saying this for months. 
---
Introducing Building Settlements: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5j9fh/building_settlements_the_perfect_camp_building/
---
I know people may be worried how this would work but all is explained in the post.
---
I think the mutations did it. I have Plague Walker (got by mistake, and forgot about it).
---
It's a straight plug into the USB and formatting the drive. The transfer took all of 10 minutes from my other external to the SSD thanks to the USB 3.0 cable it uses.
---
Yeah as well as any engine tweaks or enhancements that could be made. Both are more or less what I am referring to
---
The whole camp budget thing is a joke. 
---
I gave up on my camp when I started having to remove foundations, making it look like crap, to put in a sign for my vending machines- something just said “enough” and I stopped. 
---
Would love to buy more billboards or the new fuzzy ride but not with it how it is now.
---
Maybe it’s because you suck ass as a person
---
I can one-hit just about everything with a bloodied serrated combat knife and:
---
* 6x gladiator
---
* 3x incisor 
---
* 3x martial artist
---
* 5x adrenaline 
---
* radicool
---
* 3x nerd rage 
---
* adrenal reaction 
---
* 5x unyielding armor pieces
---
* glowing meat steak
---
Well said👍🏻
---
I play on ps4 and hardly ever see a nuked area.
---
If you are playing a bloodied build, health fluctuations and unyielding armor will cause changes to charisma and will drop the cards too,
---
It does not, to my knowledge. I think this was asked in the beginning, and one of the data miners answered it? Don't remember the exact reference.
---
Plans, random crap from low level vendors, cheap legendaries to scrip
---
I'm interested in the junkies handmade
---
I hope I don’t get a Gold TSE Handgun, Two shot sucks, and so do handguns!  I did get a BE 10mm during the sale though.  And a BE SMG. And four fixers. And a B25 Gatling gun. And a J25 Tesla. And more...
---
But I also entered the sale with 5 characters at max scrip.
---
Ayy Lmao. Gottem
---
Ok? You also said they are doing something illegal.
---
You on Xbox? Any good gloves? :P
---
If you want to max damage, you’ll want a legacy BE Laser Rifle. They break a lot, so have a good backup.  It also helps to have a backup FFR Gun for tight areas so you don’t blow yourself up with the legacy.  I used a B25 Fixer, but there are plenty of other great options.
---
6pack abs and all you can bench is 250lbs lol  I wasn't mad, you didn't know what you were talking about so I said what was really going on
---
Create a mule character and transfer the caps with the help of a courier.
---
PS4, just got an executioners limb damage 2* . I already script my other one
---
Ammo that sells well but you don't need. 1 bullet = 1 cap. The only way to break this economy is to add an ammo recycler. I'd suggest you . 45, 5.56, . 308 or 10mm. There're always people that look for normal ammo until they can prime their primary.
---
Np :)
---
Close, but probably missing some.  I don't know how their engine works exactly, but I can infer some, having dealt with stuff like this before, and being a developer/architect.
---
It is frankly pretty impressive what they have managed to make work and allow.  Have you ever considered why games like this aren't more freely extensible like Minecraft?  The static nature of them is what even makes it work.  The reason voxel's in minecraft are so big (blocks) is because the compute power to do that level of rendering is crazy high (let alone ray tracing).
---
The reason these games work so well and so fast graphically is a lot of it is pre-rendered. It all started w/id software's Wolfenstein FPS.  You create a surface, and you place items at locations, simplifying a lot of the environment.  But you have to work out walkable surfaces, and not, and a /lot/ of complexity kicks in.
---
  
---
That fallout even offers any building at all is super cool.  It's also likely why so many bugs even exist.  They could likely get rid of a TON of bugs just by making it a more static world and getting rid of the customizable building.  But how fun would that be?
---
The slow load times, they probably could do some architectural optimization, but in general it's going to be what's already loaded on your computer/console.  Much of the stock world is /already/ local to your box, which is why it's so fast. Then you load in random things that could spawn up, and it has to query and re-render locations, etc.
---
It's not a simple question, and while everything is ultimately about memory, it's not really a problem of mis-using RAM.  It's easy enough to mmap() files from memory to disk to deal with problems of that nature.
---
Serum Recipes from Modus. You can make massive profits selling them to vendors and players always need them for new characters.
---
Hey friend! I’m interested in that combat armor piece, if it’s a limb!
---
You're prob the dude in the gym that doesn't squat or deadlier rofl
---
Someone with malicious intent set on ruining the game for someone else through harrasment or bullying. Also called trolls, can (sometimes) be exploiters using unitended methods to grief other players ie passive players and nuke mines/grenades.
---
How many caps?
---
Even as a one star, a bloodied minigun should be worth a few thousand caps, the furious super-sledge isn't bad, and unless I'm terribly mistake, a vampire's flamer would essentially make you immortal as long as your fuel lasts (or the enemy out DPSs your healing)
---
You’ll have to pay 9.99 for a month and 99.99 for the year
---
Consider born survivor (rank 1 only), nerd rage, and fireproof.  I didn't find ironclad worth it over other END perks.  
---
Do you have the armored backpack?  That's good for 90 DR and with it I can get to almost 500.
---
Chems can also increase your charisma.
---
True, but remember, before we had her all of those useless legendary drops were just being left in containers to despawn. Even a 1% (or less) chance of turning them into something good is better than the giant goose egg we used to have.
---
Unyielding armor and low health can boost it by -5
---
-5*
---
Either that, or there's going to be a hell of a lot of dead NPCs. xD
---
For the last 6 or whatever weeks it's been, the wife and I have been hoping it would drop that week. Now that thanksgiving is over tho at least there's a shot. Good that i've had the time to go extra hard on dailies and challenges though.
---
Grape Mentats, Hard Bargain Perk, anything that raises your charisma stat like unyeilding armor
---
1.6x body weight bench press is stout for a steroid free lifter and at 39 years of age is pretty fucking good. By the time you're 39 you'll probably be walking around with the rest of the 39 year olds with a beer belly talking about how your job counts as a workout.
---
Yo can check weight lifting standards at EXRX to find out where you should be at your bodyweight. If you don't land in that advanced category in all lifts then you aren't bigger than me no matter what you weigh.....big boy.
---
My understanding is that faster fire is the new pvp meta. Junkies for full health. At least that's what I've been told. I stink at pvp.
---
A little bit of sleuthing and they are hiring jobs in using mongodb (and kubernetes), so that might be what they are using.
---
The backend shouldn't matter, as much as if they are using a message bus properly, and not writing directly to a db.
---
Changed my nickname to "strgInNmbrLtskeim" but even with that, people were not interested. Their problem.
---
Tip Top. There it is. In'it
---
Had one for 10c at my vendor before my ps+ died...
---
&gt;
---
&gt; I guess most people don't want bonus XP and free fast travel?
---
Im guessing people would rather err on the side of not getting ganked.. lol
---
How’d you get it like that
---
Bench press doesn't mean shi, tell me your squat and deadlift prs then I might be impressed
---
charisma buffs
---
Looted it from a lvl3 or lvl2 chest or something like that. I already learnt it. So 10c for everyone.
---
You are really missing the point like they said. A pacifist isnt an immortal being that cannot be hurt by anyone. A pacifist is someone who doesnt agree with violence or war and refuses to engage in it
---
Yes it's called reduced weight
---
No ya ik but can I have all 3 at once on the same weapon
---
Or maybe an event. Lately I was playing only near the Asylium in the cranberry bog, near Watoga.
---
Yes
---
Such a wasted potential. Imagine if from the beginning there were no barriers and people could have created mega towns. Talk about divergent gameplay. Arguments between neighbours like in real life would have created discussion. Hack developers.
---
Ok cool thx for the input
---
I’m not good at knowing all the perk combos
---
As have I. My first mule has a Nuka-Cola museum camp, so she can have the signage up, and display tons of stuff and not have to worry about everything else. But, even she is close to max budget. My second mule I made around Halloween and his camp showcases Mothman stuff... also near max budget now.
---
I'm a loner honestly. I usually have music playing when I play so I don't like using a head set. I like joining groups for events, but I'm a total line wonderer.
---
Yea this one! Buy cheap legendaries for scrip!
---
Still grinding the backpack. I run born survivor sometimes but I'm pretty good at stim use on the quick key that many times I use 2 and waste
---

Here’s the cheat sheet on reddit that someone made that is very useful when figuring out what combo of prefixes you can on on any ranged/melee weapon
---
Oh! Dude I didn’t realize either.
---
I get shotguns... Shit loads of them
---
Thank you
---
Maybe you're all looking at it from the wrong perspective.  Maybe that hot dog hasn't even gone in yet.  Maybe it's there because it's suppose to go in the other way...  Into the bum.  Kind of like... "HEY SURPRISE!  YOU SAT ON A HOT DOG!"
---
Zero messaging options for PC unfortunately, consoles have it though, does me no good lol
---
Just ignore them, they want a rise out of you or to make you log. Just ignore them and they will move on, they are douchebags with nothing better to do....
---
Block them from you life.
---
Your welcome
---
Uh what? My poor computer babies. I now see why the PC players cry
---
NERF
---
The handmade has been sold. Thank you for the interest.
---
Yay! I have this one waiting in the wings. I’m gonna try and do it with my best friend who got me into this game. No way I’ll survive solo, lol.
---
And I get pissed if that happens in West Tek.
---
It is, it's a left leg!  Apparently I forgot that very important part in my post!
---
The other likely explanation is the game seems to randomly unshare perks if you are borderline on the amount of fha required even if you never go below the required amount.  If you pad it some you'll be safer and less likely to use...so I usually have a magnetic personality card in addition to enough baseline cha to share.  My junkie seems particularly affected by this for no reason, so was thinking addictions can mess with sharing (verified plenty of cha to spare despite them...)
---
The only good raider is a ghoulish nuked radioactive raider, I say.
---
That is one thing that always disappoints me about games where you can build. I'm not very creative but when I get an idea, I want to run with it. I get so dashed (and disappointed) with a game when it dashes my creativity. Minecraft was always heralded as "anything you can imagine!!!", until I wanted to place a switch on the bottom of a block suspended in air (think Mario). I eventually get over being limited in that way (until I find another limiting thing) but it does drop my enjoyment and expectations considerably when that happens. And a lot of the restrictions on building in 76 don't even make any sense (looking at you "cannot remove stairs, part of the structure would be inacessible"), let me decide what is functional for me and what isn't.
---
350lb deadlift.
---
290lb squat.
---
Ruptured my L4/L5 15 years ago so my squat and deadlift aren't as impressive these days but I still train both once a week. I train as a power lifted so I mainly do the big 3.
---
Wow good point, I forgot about that. Wonder if those posters were propaganda or if we’ll ever see chinese LP’s walking around at some point. The armor makes me wish they’d do DLC in China at some point, if not a full blown game.
---
So my pistols build i just started isn't worth it ?
---
Read what I said. 
---
Where do I say it can never be increased?
---
Server issues = server stability. That is an issue. Just for future info 
---
www.vgr.com/stash-limit-increase-fallout-76-patch-6/
---
“We are constantly evaluating storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at the expense of server stability. We hope this additional increase to 800 pounds will help you store even more of the awesome items you’ve found in the Wasteland!”
---
Key part "but not at the expense of server stability"
---
Apparently these server issues/stability problems don't exist if you pay.
---
As a joke I put up a sign at my team-mates camp:
---
Michael Jackson Memorial Camp For Vulnerable Boys
---
Mate, I hear that.
---
It's certainly not and nor should it be. Unfortunately anonymity emboldens some people to behave in a way they never would irl.
---
When did they dupe fixers?
---
You can have dif. Characters. A gunslinger, a rifleman, an unarmed martial artist, etc.
---
I hate it when ppl get the train station. That area is a great spot for staging nuked white spring runs.
---
I think radrats are relatively stronger as there were originally in f4 nuka world which was meant for being more high level and they just copied over their stats.
---
True story. But if you’re on a team and someone in it starts something, you’re now included in that shit fest.
---
Nice man power lifter is the way to go. Damn that really sucks. Nice prs as well, keep it up and stay strong brother, hope your business goes well. I want to start my own business soon too
---
Really? You sure?
---
How much for the flamer?
---
Sure that’s funny but 9 times out of 10 it’s a bunch of clowns with ugly camps over charging on everything. I mainly look for plasma cores and i see bozos pricing them 100-200 caps each
---
I'm not a big fan of it either, and it goes against player customs. I should have mentioned that to my friend before he launched.
---
I got an Instigating 250 DR lever action rifle. Since I don't believe Bethesda, I sold it for 4000. 
---
However, since I am a man of hope, I keep a bloodied explosive 250DR 50 cal in the stash. 
---
No regrets.
---
&gt;total computer lockup’s are a constant thing now.
---
Yikes, sounds like FO76 is pushing part of your hardware beyond the brink.  Back off the overclocking?  Hard freezing a PC isn't something a game should be able to do at all.
---
It stacks, it stacks. I have some 0.050 weapons with no mods.
---
You must be new here lol.
---
Then remake the ammo that sells. 5.56 for instance.
---
I agree that the SSD gives you a significant performance boost with Fallout 76. I've tried this myself over the past month and convinced a friend to do the same. We both agree, the improvement is phenomenal.
---
One thing I'd warn against, however, is the Seagate Game Drive specifically made for Xbox. I tested two of them on both an original Xbox One and a new Xbox One X, using all available USB ports. Across the board, both of these drives (the original and the replacement shipped by Amazon), repeatedly failed to maintain a consistent connection upon startup. My consoles could only recognize the drives about 50% of the time, causing my console to attempt to install Fallout 76 on the internal drive, which caused a world of pain. It wasn't until I switched to a Samsung T5 SSD that these problems vanished entirely. It appears to be the Seagate Game Drive product line, since it happened on 2 separate drives across 2 separate consoles.
---
So you think the extra budget for your camps will just magically disappear when you log into adventure mode and leave your private server? I highly doubt so, I thought private servers were gonna be new chars only with different settings you could play around with but nah you can just jump from private to adventure, i doubt anything released into fallout 1st will be private server exclusive, except mods(hopefully??)
---
No, it does not. You aren't actually using a Stimpack to revive a teammate in NW. It plays the Stimpack sound, that is the only commonality. NW revives are a different beast than Adventure revives.
---
I neglected the lower half in my younger days and blew my back out squatting with poor form. Doctor says not to deadlift or squat but he doesn't even look like he lifts so I'm not going to take his advice.... LOL.
---
Protect your back man. They aren't joking when they say you've only got one.
---
Good luck in your future endeavors.
---
Dang I've been getting good loot lately
---
If you're a lower level, players will definitely be nice. In fact, if I saw a low level near me I would track them down and drop off any legendary items, meds, ammo, plans, etc. that I don't want. If they ask for more help I'll help out too. Since my base is in the cranberry bog idk how many players message me for help against scorchbeasts and completing the quest involving that cave with the scorchbeast.
---
Though once you get higher you might run into more toxic players who just want to grief. Otherwise we all just emote hearts at each other.
---
Um I'm also on ps4 and I'm poor donate to the poor
---
I think they do PCs first then consoles.  I don't think I've seen a patch yet and I'm on PS4.  I also have it on PC... so I just checked and no, [1.2.5.11](https://1.2.5.11) is the current patch which was released Nov 22, so you're right, he's early, or referring to a patch from 2 weeks ago.
---
I'm open to offers. Honestly I could use 5.56 as much as caps.
---
Oh ya, the opening areas are fine in terms of glitches. It's usually in the last area, cranberry bog, where the game completely breaks. Or caves! In caves I've gotten launched out of the game map, fought invisible scorched, and battled scorchbeasts glitched outside the cave area that bombard me with infinite sonar attacks. Stay away from caves!
---
[Here are the animals](https://imgur.com/a/6qjEoNy) from a friend on Discord.
---
Ik some players roast might be interested in a raid this weekend.
---
Definitely should be a component of FO 1st.
---
Changes to your charisma will do this. This is common with using armors, clothing, or drugs that alter your Charisma.
---
Block him ps4. He can't message you. Dunno if he can see you blocked him, but who cares? He deserves it based on what I read. 
---
Don't answer anything he sends you, if there somewhere you can't block them. Forget they excist. 
---
Try your best to disengage. Keep deleting messages, blocking, don't give any kind of response, even tho feel like. People who know you, know they not true. And people who believe him, are not worth try make friends with. 
---
Playing is supposed to be relaxing and fun. Drama tries to pull in, fight against it, hun. 🤗 He will give up and get bored within month or two. 
---
I got teary eyes reading your msg. I been this situation, where I were "not allowed" to go near players (especially if they weren't female player) or try make friends with anyone. It is not okay. But you can do it. You can get away. 🤗 For me it a distant memory now.
---
I'll definitely keep that mind if ever I have this drive fail. My first ever external died because for about 3 weeks was suffering frequent power outages. Ended up getting power surged with almost all 4 TB filled. Literally happened 24 hours after the warranty ended.
---
See im PvE only cuz i hate fighting players because it's never fair in a melee build vs someone with a gun I can't even reach them before I'm dead. But in my sniper build I'm so op in PvP
---
Hahaha I feel you on that, listen to a podcast where the dude hurt his back and and doctor said the same thing but lifting helped with the pain cuz he was weak when not lifting.
---
I def try to when I noticed deadlier where starting to hurt so I got advice on better form.
---
Thanks man and you as well
---
I guess I’ll pull my IE double barrel out of storage and give it a whirl!!!!
---
What I've been told that Bethesda is doing is having 2 servers one for people who have not finished the schorched story line and another for those who have
---
This is so u don't have npcs being like I'm so glad the schorchbeasts are not heart I heard they were terrifying but there is a scorchedbeast flying in the distance
---
Yes we know
---
I would give u 5k 556 or caps which ever is good with me
---
Dang I hate people like that that sounds scary to be honest
---
I hope you block him and return to fallout 76
---
If you ever want to play with someone that's not like that ill play with you if you need someone to keep you company 👍
---
This is so you can't be killed in one shot.
---
Never bother me being one shot gave me a reason to keep approving
---
Sorry ment improving
---
Shoutout to whoever still supports this game, y’all are hardcore fans - Hodd Toward
---
Yeah Im sure. I have a two shot gatling plasma and a hunters gatling plasma  and the hunters did higher damage ti the sbq vs the two shot.
---
Everyday I play this game and I have over 500 hours.. I’ve never experienced almost any of these glitches. Sometimes enemies r invincible but when they r they don’t move so they pose no threat. I’ve never had that in an event either.. events do end when I arrive sometimes and that’s tedious but I chalk it up to poor timing on my part and yeah player camps disappear sometimes too but that’s them leaving or being kicked nothing more. 
---
Really sorry to hear u have experienced all these issues, maybe it’s a bad night but don’t give up just yet I have a nearly flawless time playing each day.  What console do u play on, out of curiousity
---
My bad.  Game is more fun on Acid anyway.
---
I never even thought about that. Holy frell. That's way dark, and I love it.
---
Also allow us to build next to friends' camps
---
You know, I agree with OP's sentiment, but this comment brought me down to earth and humbled me away from raising a pitchfork.
---
They could make you sell a magazine of 12 for 6 caps similar how you can't sell a single steel.
---
The kids and ones that pvp you with their friends make me pass on invites anymore. I've had to block younger players because after accepting their invite and playing for that session they friend me and then any time I sign in they send play invites over and over before I even load up the game and after I message I'm not going to team right now. I know they were younger because they had mics..and the screaming they like to do..
---
I found out the hard way accepting team invites can be a set up. The first time a low level invited but I didn't see he had a high level chameleon friend waiting until I died, I've had other times where as soon as I'm in the team someone leaves the team and I die. I'm horrible at pvp so I don't try to get back at them, just leave the team and do whatever I was before the invite.
---
I had a Bloodied Minigun,i thought it would be the Dogs Bollocks.
---
I was shocked how s\*\*t it was.
---
With all the heavy weapon Perks maxed out,running with virtually no health i was struggling to get 90 + per Bullet.
---
An anti Armour Gatling using the same Perks plus full Health is 150 + per Bullet.
---
No idea why this is.
---
These days i use an Explosive 50 Cal,it is the Mutts Nuts.I can shred level 60 Scorched Beasts in about 30 seconds.
---
It does a lot of damage to the [Queen.It](https://Queen.It) shows me the damage i do to the  Queen on her Health Bar.
---
I turn up at SBQ fight the Bi\*\*h always dies.
---
Do observe that furious and explosive is a very bad combo. If the explosion hits a secondary target it resets the furious counter since furious only builds up on one creature at a time. It works on large enemies (like the Queen, she is so big you normally dont hit anyone else) and on solitary enemies, but on groups of enemies  the furious/explosive combo only does explosive damage with a continously reset furious counter that never builds up.
---
I've had similar experiences I had someone taking my workshops just because I was a lower level then then. That didn't make sense he didn't even need the workshop just didn't rant me to have it.
---
I don't kick my stuff so people can take it if they want.
---
What platforms do u play on in a Ps4 player and I don't get many buillies on it but one every week
---
They work fine for Buster Scruggs. You just need the right set of perks and a song in your heart!
---
Shit thanks for the tip
---
I would say these results are mostly sever side you must have been lucky for a few sessions as I am on Xb1X and my GF both with SSD' and we each have a Samsung and a sandisk SSD yet we still see delay on rewards and from containers regularly but different server bare different results. Load times are outstanding compared to a HDD but it is not the fix all you are thinking it is plenty of issues with pop in and UI delay.
---
In Australia at least, they have committed a felony act by doing so. We don't share your consumer laws where the fault is on the consumer rather than the company, regardless of how late into things the company alters the deal.
---
Keep in mind that 90% only applies to the base weight **without mods on**. Once you start slapping more and more mods that perk gets less and less useful.
---
I hope that the caps lock makes your message heard
---
It’s mostly for that accidental pvp where you protect your life.
---
T5 is indeed very nice. Sandisk is also a nice alternative FYI.
---
Same! Video games are my "take a break from the world." hobby. But despite everything, theres something profoundly nostalgic and special about this game. I'm playing the soundtrack while I push through finals and I feel at home again. 
---
I'll definitely reach out for help in the future if I feel uncomfortable again. ❤❤❤
---
A couple of thoughts:
---
1) Unless you're a Bloodied build, it wouldn't be possible to one-shot you. You can only take 110 damage per shot in PvP now, and you get 250 HP with 1 Endurance.
---
2) There's no point being a Bloodied build for PvP anymore due to the new 110 cap on damage. You can achieve this number with a full health build, so why compromise? My Bloodied build used to wreck everyone in PvP before the damage nerf. I've given it a few goes since just to test it out, and it's pretty bad. I've switched to a full health build.
---
3) Your current build is all over the place. A good build needs to be laser-focused. You're got perks for both rifles and heavy weapons, for example. You're sacrificing tanky potential for increased damage on another class of weapons. I recommend you pick one.
---
3a) If you go with heavy weapons, you may as well go with Power Armor and Stabilized to get that armor penetration. 
---
4) Damage and Energy Resistance have diminishing returns. After a certain point, you're just wasting your time. Also, the fact that there's a damage cap means that damage resistance in PvP doesn't mean much. For example, let's say an enemy is going to do 700 damage per shot if you have no damage resistance at all. That's reduced to 110. Now let's say your damage resistance reduces the enemy damage from 700 to 500. Again, that's going to be capped at 110 anyway. Instead, you want to maximize the effectiveness of that damage cap by increasing your HP pool. At 250 HP, you die at 3 hits. At 350HP, you die at 4 hits. Perks like Serendipity can also give you an extra chance at survival by reducing an attack to 0 damage. Stacking perks and armor that reduce a percentage of damage will go a long way. Dodgy, Fireproof, the Dense armor mod, and Sentinel Assassin armor prevent significant PvP damage. That's how you tank effectively.
---
Sorry at work...sounds good its max lvl right?
---
I always give free stuff to people. I’m a nice person but it’s more because I don’t have room for all my shit.
---
Hopefully!! This has been going on since last winter. 😩❤
---
That is abuse.
---
As others suggest block them on PS4.
---
Weird how the virtual World mirrors the real World.99.9 % players are good people who make the game a healthy,positive experience.
---
0.01 % try ruin it for others.
---
A friend gave me a copy of the game for free, so we could team up. Otherwise I wouldn't have it lol. It's fun though.
---
If you sell something under a pretence, and it can be established that you had no ability or inclination to deliver on said thing, that can be construed as false and misleading conduct under sections of the Australian Consumer Law.
---
When I start hitting the cap cap first thing I do is camp hop looking for "investments."
---
Typically that's ammo (5.56, 308, 45, 50 etc) which I can keep for use or resell. Scrip level legendaries being sold at scrip level prices and sometimes even quality weapons and armor being sold for far less than they're worth. Generally anything of good value or rarity that I can keep or sell.
---
After a couple of circuits and server hops if I still have money to burn that's when I hit up the vendors for plans.  Serum plans are a good way to sink a lot of cash in an investment that will eventually pay off. Camp, weapon and armor plans to complete your collection are kind of nice too even if they won't ever make you any money.
---
Hahaha, that was my first thought. It's weirdly satisfying to boxing glove punch a deathclaw to death.
---
Covert Ops, Mr. Sandman, nighttime shot = x7 multiplier to the base damage. Also Bloody Mess.
---
People buy 10mm? I didn't know that. My mule is about to feel a *little* lighter tonight
---
Yep, level 50. VATS critical +50%, 15% faster reload, health regeneration when you hit an enemy. I have it stored, just send me a PM when you are ready to exchange.
---
That would be awesome especially if the server was max lvl mobs all over the place.
---
I wont be on til tomorrow if thats cool..psn RoninRage0352 i should be on all day tomorrow so just message me when ur on
---
I have the resolute veteran but usually use my 2
---
That's fine. I pulled if from my vending machine. I'll be on randomly tomorrow, but I will message you when I am.
---
Thank you this makes sense reading but I just wasn't grasping this. I'll continue to fox this tank and stick with it
---
I just rerolled on Xbox from PC, I'm a lowly Lvl 13

---
😰 I truly hope he lets go. 
---
I been same situation. 
---
Just be strict, don't let them keep pulling you into drama.
---
Now it might seem like never ending, stress causing thing. But once he blocked, and you not give him any, not single one, reaction or response, he will give up, realizing he talking by himself like loony.
---
I hope you get to enjoy fallout soon. ♥️
---
You cant have explosive and fire rate on the same weapon
---
Fuck me, mongodb?  Easily the most trash NoSQL option in existence.
---
While it’s very buggy at times, the building base building factor is a lot of fun in this game. I fully agree about raising the build limit. I’ve spent hours building my base and I’d like to expand it...
---
Told by who? Your uncle at Nintendo?
---
any chance this was on PC? i recall seeing a blast zone with converted munitions at ground zero lol
---
Stalkers 50% limb damage Reduced weight Lead Pipe

Haha I just did my first silo run solo last weekend, kudos to you my dude!
---
YES!!!!! love that guy.
---
No, it was PS4 a couple weeks ago
---
Vampiric Explosive Reduced Weight LMG. My first roll and still my best.
---
Claiming a workshop or attacking a wanted player opens your entire team to PvP. Pacifist doesn't stop you from taking damage, only damaging others.
---
Two words: Gatling. Laser.
---
Yeah i remember those , i hated them#
---
There are so many good ones, I can’t really say or remember what was best. That BE LMG you got is a really good one though!  If you’re on the PC and want to trade or sell it let me know.  I’d love to get my hands on it!
---
Raize57. Hit me up sometime too. I’m also a lone wanderer in the game
---
Red shoe diaries title is definitely click bait but good for you.
---
A Bloodied 10mm sub is dope. Even some people use 10mm pistol to tag legendaries at events.
---
That’s actually a really good idea. I’ll have to look into that perk. Thanks for the tips!
---
I doubt it...probably shouldn't post right after something like that happens, but damn...4 times in two days the exact same thing. I thought it was because of melee issues, but this time was a 50 cal at range. 
---
Since the last update all I get are crashes, game freezes, lag like you wouldn't believe. I have a 1X, this machine doesn't do that. I have GB internet, it's not that either. Cleared the cache &amp; reset the Xbox, nope no change.
---
I play other games at 4k and they look &amp; play great. I fire up 76 &amp; you would think I was running an old 486 machine on dial up.
---
I just don't get how they can take the game &amp; make it worse every time they touch it. They must hire the most incompetent developers they can find.
---
Bethesda should just sell the IP to someone that can do it justice. I don't think at this point the game will ever run properly. The list of bugs just seems to go on, &amp; when they do manage to actually fix something, the bug that they'd previously fixed returns. All that going in circles tells me they don't have a clue.
---
&gt; they added a challenge that required healing someone in water, they were shocked that some people would JUMP OFF CLIFFS INTO SHALLOW RIVERS so others could complete it lol.
---
My wife and I are trying to do this one right now. Problem is, we keep dying instead and don’t get the option to “call for help”. Advice? It seems sort of random when the game let’s you “call for help” or just forces you to respawn. I am sure we are just doing something wrong, but I don’t know...
---
Workshop battles are fun if you're up for a challenge
---
If this were a thing I would be the richest in the game when it came to .50 cal
---
North of Vault 76 is Tayler County. There you can find sometime an event with guaranteed level 5 to 15 legendaries. Other easily legendaries would be at whitespring golf club. Cripple everything, then take care of the legendaries. Other than that, hoards events. I don't know if the Burrows at Harper's Ferry is available for low level, but you can find some legendary gouls there.
---
Event AWOL Armaments event at robco Research Center guarantee at least one legendary too. Be careful about legendary robots because it explode after death everytime. 
---
Keep an eye on the random ennemies that try to invade the whitespring area and fight the bots.
---
Otherwise, hunt scorchbeast in the cranberry bog. 
---
Can't really remind of more places for now.
---
Hey bro, if that offer still stands I could greatly use some PS4 help! I’m getting my butt handed to me out here haha. My psn is joelhandsdown 
---
Thanks mate!
---
Whitesprings, maybe? It seems to be the only (mostly) undamaged area in the game. Might take a lot of hunting though.
---
Try Whitesprings, the same location where you get Grants Sword for one of the other quests ( the President's room) That's where I got mine.
---
Yeah, I did half an hours worth of running around there with no luck. Probably still is my best shot.
---
Yeah , it was a time when 2-shot was king a long time ago 😁
---
Vampire’s is probably the best legendary for heavy weapons. As long as you have ammo, you will never die.
---
That's what I told her. She REALLY wants the pink power armor skin we keep seeing around. I told her just be patient. It'll be back. Lol.
---
You don’t need to kill three stars. Do Leader of the Pack three times and you’ll have killed 9 legendaries.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Officer_on_Deck
---
Also, under the walk-through paragraph.
---
That was it! You on ps4 hopefully?
---
I just did it, and I got the plan for the power fist, but nothing else was worth anything for me.
---
This guy codes
---
Uninstalling the game
---
Grinding stuff, doing events a rarely do, trying to solo silo, SBQ, and other shit. Try to get the whoopsie (half joking).
---
Are you just sitting and waiting to type that? That was damn near instant.
---
do you have the dirty old teddy
---
The pink sprinkles one? If so that one is from Nuclear Winter.
---
I dig that. So kinda like fo4 endgame stuff, except we have wastelanders to look forward to.
---
I can't help myself. It's a flaw, I know.
---
i know where all of them are mr fuzzys also
---
troll
---
“mAyBe ItS bEcAuSe yOu SuCk AsS aS a PeRsOn”
---
I have been baited. :p
---
Ah well
---
is it just a teddy bear in a funny position or is the whole thing a junk item
---
I think if you fall from too much of a height, it just kills you. I just built my camp above a river and kept running up and jumping off, slowly getting hurt bit by bit, till i was "downed" so they could heal me.
---
And the worst part is people are gonna pay for it! (Have been, and will continue to)
---
multiple junk items in a pose
---
Yeah buuuuuut can you babysit a low level player and make his day in FO4 endgame? :p
---
Yes they double dip. Just to give you an idea. I have a junkies pipe bolt action with all maxed rifleman and gunslinger perks on, and bloody mess. Dmg in pip boy is 384 per shot. Junkies lever is 257, junkies fixer is 160. This is with 5 addictions running.
---
No I cannot!
---
Honestly the most fun I have is following around people and supporting their kills and adventures...
---
I should make an extra attempt at that tonight, thank you!
---
this is just my experience, but ive found a lot of the stories really compelling and interesting? there's a whole background story that's not really explored in the main quest about automation and shitty corporations which i loved learning about. the story's only interesting if you read notes/terminals and listen to holotapes, as just going through the main story quickly can leave a lot to be desired
---
It is resting on laurels of the past, but it is far from garbage in a world with stalkers weapons, not to mention often better than the situational affix guns.  When you don't have something better a two-shot is pretty damn good.
---
Lately I've been getting involved in PvP. It's a lot of fun, and a nice challenge. It's also pretty resource intensive, so I need to farm stealth boys, ammo components, and Nuka Quantums when stock gets low.
---
When I'm at the PvE side of things, I mostly grind the good events when they show up. I never miss a Queen or an Encryptid. I'd like to do stuff like Arktos Pharma and raids, but I'm solo so that's a bit of a no-go.
---
Well a lot of us are too then. I never thought about it until you wrote this. We can all be stupid together :D
---
I love finding new environmental story telling in the game. I am almost at a thousand hours played and am still finding new things. You have to not just stick to the usual farming areas.
---
one of the main things i liked about the plot was learning about the political situation of WV before the bombs dropped, as well as the return of west tek. i wish the game went more into what the scorched actually are, such as how the hell it's possible for a disease to create a hivemind. in the future, id love to see a continuation of that (especially more info on things like the FEV in the water of huntersville).
---
During the half price sale I got like 7 fixers and I didn’t get a single one this time. I did get a bloodied ffr fr western revolver.
---
I’d just call it mediocre at best these days.  There are only just a few prefixes that are good.  I wish Bethesda would upgrade some of the less useful ones
---
I have shadow prime on my excavator at the moment....
---
What you really want with furious is Faster Fire Rate, that is a pretty solid combo
---
I came from /r/new
---
Oooo ok ok I feel that
---
As it should. It's disgusting.
---
was this just a pc update
---
Well that’s fair.
---
Then as a serious response.
---
Nah, I like the game, a lot. It’s just reached a dull point where I’m content with my character. There’s tons to do, I just enjoy the conversation about a topic I like while I’m in a lull.
---
:P with my stealth commando I was following people too but as a stalker B) until I got bored and give 'em all the plans I looted and forgot to put in my vendor. Or craft them a full moded weapon for low level.
---
Gives you almost unvulnerability for fire and explosions.
---
For me it’s all about find the best weapons out there, and I’m doing the raids lately.
---
Probably 15K if it’s max level.
---
I can think of two problems. 1. You do not understand DPS and/or two you did not have a proper Bloodied build.  You simply do not compare a Mini Gun and a Gatling at a per bullet damage, that is not how any of this works.
---
Also one night I followed a guy in full raider outfit, we cleaned Lewisburg and went to a camp near it. It was owned by a responder but he was wearing a basic combat helmet with a responder jumpsuit, I crafted him all the dark variations of combat helmet, and the raider and the responder went into some trade and emote chat, thx to them I took some nice photo this night of a responder aiming at a raider with a single action.
---
My latest treasure is a TSE lightweight Gatling gun.
---
9/9 heavy weapons makes that thing really consistent for any fight.
---
I need a good shotgun. But it HAS to be vampire. Right now I have a vampiric combat shotgun and I am invincible against anything that doesn’t have radiation damage :p
---
What level are you?  I suspect you are too low to progress.
---
Especially how much of a chunk turrets take out it. I get its defense it plays a good role but that's alot for just turrets
---
A ghoul slayers gamma gun ,fun as hell😁
---
I hated the balance between functionality and aesthetic design. I usually just threw function to the wind so I could have a nice log cabin up in the mountains.
---
Agree. I want to build a BOS stronghold. I can build a pretty decent size but then filling it with furniture and clutter is the problem. 
---
And the bloody lights! I've pretty much got no lights because they take up too much budget.
---
Thanks, for the info. I run a junkies heavy currently, my alt will be a bloody build. I want to find a good bloodied explosive pipe revolver
---
for some reason I find this hard to believe. Am I missing all the cool people in this game? I rarely encounter anyone at all, but when I do, it’s usually some simian camp-sniping me at a workshop I claimed that nobody ever even goes to. Lol.
---
Right, I didn't say it was better than that.  It is just for a lot of casual players it is a lot better than most of what they have had.  Things are relative, that was my point.
---
It happens.
---
I guess my excitement is the fact that I was running with a regular fixer I crafted myself. Never had a good legendary version.
---
Communist aggressor detected.
---
Two fixers, an aa ffr and a bloodied
---
Level 43 mate.
---
Thank you for explaining it to me. I’ll give it a go :)
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to write that mate. I’ll head to those locations and have a look what I can find now :) thank you again!
---
Or we think some rando will pick a fight with a buddy to pvp us or fuck with our camp, so no piss off I am not going to accept your friend request.
---
PS4?
---
Xbox One
---
43 is definitely a bit low for it.  If you have good gear though, you should be able to do it.
---
The only downside is getting used to the recoil.
---
There is no armor in this game that makes you "tanky" in terms of pvp. There is no armor whatsoever that will help against someone using a legacy or any high tier fixer or handmade.
---
Good for you if that works for you, but not everyone is you or plays like you do.
---
It is all relative, it takes a lot of time and effort or great luck) to get top tier gear. This sub is an echo chamber of people like me who have way too much time in the game.   It is a very decent weapon enjoy it until you find something better, the game is a journey, not a race.
---
So far thats the only place Ive heard it spawns, went there a couple times and couldnt find it. So yeah, it could be a rare spawn. Although, this was some time ago, so maybe last couple updates changed that?
---
Sorry bud, I could have given you one on ps4
---
One thing I’ve noticed after using 2 xboxes at the same time with some tests:
---
Some of the load time gains with SSD are comparable to running Ethernet. XB1X with SSD has 1-3 seconds faster than a 1S connected via Ethernet at the router.
---
You’ll always have faster secondary load ins with SSD, for example, without SSD on the 1S you’ll have up to 8 or so seconds at toxic Larry’s before snallygasters appear.
---
Nuke Cola machines should also work like the punch bowls too.
---
You would need to be hitting for over 539 dmg per shot with an AA weapon before you could take stabilized off.
---
I’d say for weapons, something really good comes ever 3k scrip. For armor it’s slightly better.  Those returns aren’t terrible, considering the anti-armor limb damage rolling pins from drops weren’t going anywhere but the trash otherwise.
---
I'm using bld powerfist and ins. Dcg that don't get buffs from cladiator. Meathook would be different.
---
Oh, well crap. I'll have to log in on her account and start running NW for her. (She detests pvp. Lol) thanks for the info!!! If I can manage to get it for her, well, I might just beat out the stranger for gift of the year! 😂
---
Level 45, if I remember correctly.
---
Lol, I feel ya. She and I usially run together and have seen maybe 1 act of kindness (aside from revives during SBQ) though we've done a few ourselves. This was I think our first from a complete random. And I've been playing since day 1 and she was on a week later...
---
Got you.
---
Goooo.... Well, I definitely got my work cut out for me. Lol
---
This came about I think after patch 14. I made a post about it but not many people are upset about it. I was heavily annoyed by it but eventually got used to it. It happens from the floor boards and it effects the walls and then the roof. The edges clip into one another and shifts everything a small amount in 1 direction causing gaps.
---
Bethesda: *set no build limit*
---
Players: "it's free real estate"
---
I know you can’t kill a wanted person with it on.
---
I honestly think that all the perks should just be apart of pistols (not the damage perks.) So the run speed, range, weight reduction and limb damage. It would balance the fact you lose valuable agility slots for the damage cards plus the fact that there are more pistols that CAN'T have suppressors than can. Might as well be heavy guns 🙄. Shotguns have a better suppressor to non ratio... 
---
I'd really like to see pistols at least be faster and more accurate with gunfu.
---
If you're in America yeah. Here in Canada it's $17.99/month or $129.99/year. Here in Ontario there is 13% tax on top so it becomes around $20/month and $146/year. 
---
It doesn't look like much until you take into account what you're already spending each month. I always see American prices and wish that is what I had to pay but taxes are expensive here.
---
AA weapons ignore up to 50% armor which is 28% damage if you are not near the armor penetration cap. Junkies is 10% extra dmg with a max of 5 for 50% extra dmg. Junkies is significantly stronger than AA.
---
Why're you booing me? I'm right.
---
At least they did have weight reduce and increase reload speed.
---
They did even have multiple disable/enhance perk like scattered shot and enforcer, worked like a charmed for newbie.
---
Look at my poor AR/Handmade after the explosion nerf...
---
To take my mind off things.
---
It drops one of the shielded under armour plans, don't remember which one but it's rare
---
I love it when it's at the power station north of watoga, closest thing we have to a deathclaw horde
---
you should mention you're a female 
---
you will basically have fo1st for free then
---
I like your idea as I was thinking "well no, i like that the camp limits people as I dont want to be restricted from playing the game when I log in and am faced with everyones massively over extended camps"
---
Owl_No is my psn
---
While I like the idea, I think it would suck for everyone else. As a weekend player, I'm quite low level. I dont have the time to put hours and hours into the game and build stuff. I also don't really care for the building and prefer exploring and quests. 
---
I think if you were just allowed to build anywhere you wanted, some people would take it to the extreme and ruin the servers for other, newer players. It would all just be built up, some of it maybe locked up, and it would ruin both the gameplay and the asthetic for everyone else.
---
Don't know if you can display them, but there are several different colored cappy jacket n jeans that can be found in the tnt dome with the t51b nuka paint
---
Also all the flavors if nuka
---
Non-explosive railway rifles are bugged and don't benefit from concentrated fire so they are terrible in vats. I have a qffr railway rifle that can blow 30 misses in a row. It's stunning how bad the accuracy is.
---
Um. Pretty sure faster reload and per take up the same slot
---
Have you tried vamp prefix?
---
Save up yer caps.
---
You son of a bitch! I'm in!
---
I play with no mods at all. 
---
I tried to create a customer support ticket, but there's this weird bug where everytime I do any action outside the bethesda.net the page refreshes and I need to start writing  a ticket all over again and prevents me from adding report from the bethesda.net launcher which is necessary to create a ticket.
---
A lot of people max out robot vendors with marine tactical helmets. The recipe takes glass plastic and rubber
---
My pleasure! Good luck on your dismantling!
---
My pleasure!
---
It should take you about 5 days to get enough caps. Just get the 1.4k from the vendors every day, won't be long
---
When I peaked into the game during the free trial week, straight at the Overseers camp I met a player who was like:
---
“Hey, let’s have a drink together. This one is on me!”
---
And then he gave me a bottle of Nukashine. I guess you know how this turned out…
---
But I couldn’t even be mad since it was so hillarious…
---
Generally, I am not a fan of older players showering newbies with goods and gear. I know it’s meant well, but it kinda takes the fun out of the game.
---
If I aproach things alone or in a group of similar-leveled folks it feels so rewarding getting the next better piece of gear, even if it’s rather low crap.
---
Instead getting handed a full high-lvl supply feels like “Yeah, great. Now I can just cake-walk thru the game till max-level and everything I find on my way will be meaningless…”
---
Anyway, can’t wait to find my copy in the mailbox. Amazon says it should be there today or tomorrow…
---
you cant i already tried i wish there was like mannequins or something you can put your outfits on
---
Really? It doesn’t use up a stimpak? I always thought it did, mostly because of the load screen that says “you can revive teammates without a stimpak in Nuclear Winter, but it takes longer”. I always took that to mean that you can also revive them with a stimpak and it’s faster. But now that I think about it, it could just mean that stimpaks aren’t used for revival at all in NW... I guess that just wasn’t the intuitive read for me. Thanks for the answer.
---
I’m level 200+ and still remember my first nuke, congrats pal! It IS exciting!
---
Thanks for the reply. Sucks that there isn’t a perk for faster revivals.
---
Taxation is theft. American taxes are out of control tbh but voters keep approving them yet they get all wide eyed when people like you tell them what their future is.
---
Ok thanks. I swear Everytime I set up a workshop I get a server cool down, I'm starting to wonder if it's because I play in the middle of the night
---
I'm back again. 😂 Stack of nuka cups?
---
For PvE, you only need a vampire's weapon and some armor. With my T-51b and vampire's ultracite gatling laser, I never die unless if I get hit by some seriously heavy damage. The impostor sheepsquatch will typically kill me, but otherwise I don't die when I have that thing out.
---
I've made it my mission to give new player PA frames when I find some in the wild.
---
On PS4 me and a couple of my Friends all had crashes on they. The CE message still happens and black loading screens of death also happen on them
---
Thanks, not going to waste my money then
---
You may have to contact support.
---
Congrats! 2 shot is still good damage output, just aim manually and it'll tear stuff up. One of my faves is a 2 shot handmade!
---
lol yeah i found them in the nuka-cola factory in the beverage test area on the side with the locker at the end
---
i thought it was cool there was single cups and maybe like two stacks i feel like i seen them at other places though
---
Hell yeah! That’s the spirit! Out of curiosity what console do u play on or r u pc?
---
I will find you. And I grief you.
---
if i need to have +30% dmg vs animals i will go to purveyor
---
I'm on PS4 with 100mbs internet. The lowest it has dropped to was 56mbs. But it could be the PS4, i have a nighthawk router that does fizzle out once in a while, that's why I always test my internet speed first to see if I need to reboot the router before I play. Thanks for the input 😊
---
I’m still waiting to get a fixer from mumbles
---
Junkies explosive reduced weight,mutants explosive reduced weight and instigating faster reload +10 dmg while aiming
---
Love this bit of payback awesome
---
If you really like it you won’t call it a waste of caps😬
---
A7a just bought the game only to find this.. any solution or should i just go for a refund?
---
When you get to a high enough level return the favour
---
I hate deleting things just so I can make a beer
---
Bloodied meat hook for sure is overpowered as all heck. Try vampires, junkies, or maybe furious and look into a bit of a sneak bonus. You'll want a good swing speed. If you're looking to go bloodied I can give you more tips.
---
Get party boy and drink whisky for a strength boost of 6, and try psychobuff or fury. 
---
If you have the time to become a high end chef, the melee buffs are insane
---
Yeah, it's confusing wording for sure. You won't always have a stimpack to revive allies in NW.
---
Death Stranding.
---
All that needs to be said.
---
Don't they chase you though
---
I finally got a legendary Fixer of my own today as well. It's not a god roll by any means but it's still better than default.
---
It's a three-star, +10% damage for being mutated, +40% bashing damage and +1 Agility.
---
Vintage Nukashine and the Nukashine label (if you still have it that is.  worse comes to worst just ask around or get it on a new character and trade it to ur main).
---
You could always set your ammo cost to zero instead of making it cost 1 cap.  But then again, its cheaper to just make your own ammo in bulk.  The munitions workshop can yield 100 ammo per hour, but you could make 1000 in less than 1 minute with the ammo perk and the super duper perk.  Looting ammo is just worthless and buying/trading them is also worthless, I just dump mine on the ground after a session.  I don't need 500 rounds of .308 if I never use it, weight/stash space is more important than 500 rounds.  And if you ever need to do a ammo run, lucky hole mine raid server hopping for acid is the way to go.
---
I thought there always was? Just that for some reason it did less damage than the hardened 308. Now thats been fixed.
---
With camp building, I’ve opened up a bar. I keep it stocked with every alcoholic beverage in the game and when I sell out of a particular one, I go out and collect ingredients to make more. It’s all oddly satisfying.
---
So maybe I was more psyched than necessary. I modded it the same exact way as my default fixer and it does half the damage. Wtf?
---
Damn the Xbox people could be mean ps4 is like here’s 2 of em
---
Perception and faster reload can't be on the same weapon
---
yeah, I feel you. It really digs at you kinda like the whole mistress of mystery ending. So many good plotlines that have me feelies. I really hope we get to see more in wastelanders
---
That is an unarmed weapon.
---
If only plans were account based.
---
I can't bring myself to create anything on another character due to lack of unlocks.
---
I use to play minecraft and it might open up more griefing.  Like this one player who has fallout 1st following me and kept placing his portable camp in my way constantly.
---
Do you have the plan for the Nuka Clock? No shrine is complete without it.
---
Maybe all the children died from the FEV virus. They did turn into other "creatures" too, haven't played for a long time but wasn't the snallygaster formed from the FEV? Maybe the children mutated into other things.
---
Well, atleast assault rifle isn't *that* bad.
---
I think Bethesda need to remove this ridiculous vendor budget. Or, atleast, make it reset in 8 hours, not 20.
---
They seriously need to up the budget limit. I know they said it's because of "server stability" but guess what...there's private servers now...let us have bigger camps on private servers!
---
Spent around 3000 scrip, only noteworthy is an AAE FR harpoon gun. Don't like it but been told it's worth much
---
Just a thought, wouldn't the code be similar to dual wielding in skyrim?
---
I'd like to see different "levels" that you could set for teammates. Level one: full access. Level 2: Build only. Level 3: Look but don't touch.
---
Third character that is a pistol build. Makes the game difficult and challenging again. 
---
Mostly, it is the social aspect of it though that keeps me playing.
---
That's true but the crazy thing is that it also benefits from one handed perks!
---
Don't just take 1 person's experience.
---
I'm on PS4 into the 2nd month now.
---
Hasn't crashed, much quicker load in and alot smoother.
---
The best part about it in IMO is that when I do events or go looking for ledgendaries,  I'm actually going to be able to claim the prize because besides my mate's "Who share kills" we are the only one's on the server.
---
Only downside is player vending, if you like to sell stuff.
---
+30% dmg vs animals
---
Wireless or wired connection?
---
Ah not faster reload. Faster fire rate 15%
---
I do...
---
I wouldn't mind it if the personal camp stayed as it was, but workshops had a huge build radius (or an item that increases the radius)
---
Somebody needs a nap.
---
So you can bash them over the head with a cryolator?
---
What they should do is give us a private world that WE can host even if it only works something similar to ark or conan.
---
It's RNG, I got some PA pieces plans from this event as well as Ultracite Gatling Laser, PowerFist Heating Coil plan and Marine Shielded. But I've done hundreds of this events and only few times reward was worth it...
---
You can find them easily at Big Al's Tattoo Parlor (Biv E. Ridge's place).
---
O.O
---
Remind me to always wear the hazmat suit from now on when I handle these
---
i have some if you are still online or i will be online later PSN blaine\_anderson
---
Uny/AP/Sentinel Combat armor arm (light unfortunately) and VE25 Fixer are my best rolls from Purveyour so far.
---
No, it's not tough. I did it at level 50, solo. Still doing it solo.
---
Wireless. If I put the router in my game room, my son bitches that his Xbox in his room doesn't work lol
---
Same here. PS4. Lots of freezes and there's no point running anywhere as there's a real lag in landscape and building elements loading on screen. Keep running into invisible walls, lol.
---
My most annoying problem is the server cool downs.
---
Doubt that but i guess we will see more save-zones like vault 76 and flatwoods
---
Dude OMG I was thinking the same fucking thing since it’s release 😂😂😂😂
---
25%
---
Can anyone describe the best mods for the fixer? Have a level 50 (traded, no plans) that shoots fast, has terrible recoil, and goes through lots of ammo, so can't say I've found it to be better than my go-to Instigating lever action rifle.
---
Yeah I'm guessing it was the one 2 week's ago haven't launched since Fallout first came out.
---
Actually my grandma from sega told me.
---
I know it would cause super stress on the servers. So I don't see it happen anytime soon but I would love to have the logic gates from the fallout 4 dlc.
---
Hi, mind giving me an invite as well? Looking for someone to play too. Thanks.
---
Yes.  The ones you haven't mentioned...
---
\- Nuka Tapper Hologame
---
\- Souvenir Plastic Bowl
---
You can't display these, but there are 5 outfit variants (plus 2x PA), 8 drinks (inc. shine), the machine, the stashbox, 2 neon signs, quantum sign, the clock, advertisement posters, 2 grenades, and the dark recipe.  That's everything obvious.  If you really want to dig deep, the Blank Feedback form and a few other notes/holotapes become relevant.
---
$20 a month
---
Taxes have been cut far too much in recent years, especially on the rich and corporations. We're living rather dangerously, just keep cutting, and we need to get back in balance. What's out of control nationally is the deficit, locally it varies.
---
It’s been 61 days and this still hasn’t been fixed. I wanna “lol”, but it hurts too much.
---
Have you ever watched RifleGaming on YouTube? He has gathered players and built settlements multiple times.
---
I'll be honest, i don't watch much fo76 content on youtube. Will check it out though. Still i feel like you can't build camps/houses "close enough" to eachother.
---
Nah man same!! That was literally my fav armor from
---
New Vegas!! I never took it off after finding it in lonesome road 😂 like literally MONTHS
---
Me af when I downloaded the NCR Ranger Armour mod for Fallout 4. And also me with any ranger/riot armour from FNV
---
Vote
---
Honestly bro, I got that mod the second I saw it and wore the fuck out of it, it’s just the ideal representation of Wasteland western badass
---
Go to the farm in the northwest and get some cranberries to make some cranberry cobbler. Then i go to Morgantown airport and kill everything. Sell all the weapons to the robot vender there server hop rinse repeat. Do the mama dolce and the airport event when it pops. Can get to 5-20 fairly quickly there. Put on a podcast or a tv show and grind away.
---
Good point, I'm a loner video game wise. This is really the first mmo I have played. Maybe I will have to run some lan cable through the attic and straight wire my ps4
---
XP :D
---
I actually think it is you... I was on for 5 hours yesterday with no disconnects.
---
Try grafton steel, a lot of low level super mutants. And a lot of wepons to scrap
---
It's fine in burst, in vats it isn't a problem at all.
---
Fuck yeah I do
---
Because you play too much fallout.
---
That's what I thought private worlds would do, your own world, where you can build in worksops without fear of despawning
---
Because I've paid 15k caps on the shotgun and now I'm disappointed :(
---
Since my First subscription is over, I'm back to dealing with inventory management on the "hard mode"
---
&gt; Here in Canada it's $17.99/month or $129.99/year. 
---
You can't compare Canadian dollars and US dollars like that.
---
17.99 CAD is 13.52 USD, so you're paying only 0.53 USD more.
---
&gt;  I always see American prices and wish that is what I had to pay but taxes are expensive here.
---
Don't forget that if you got to pay American prices you'd get some other fun features of American life like American health care provision.
---
&gt; Taxation is theft. 
---
Property is theft if you're going to go full on anarchist.
---
For sane people taxation is the price we pay for civilisation.
---
&gt; the world itself is a fixed thing, immutable and unchanging. 
---
Various "scrap everything" mods in FO4 prove that's not completely true.
---
Lol i fast traveled to the zone but i literally arrived the moment the bomb dropped, i died :(
---
I gave up because I could not past the obstacle course for basic training. I wanna say it is because it is bugged, but honestly I think I did not do it right abd suck at it.
---
On.xbox sorry.
---
&gt; I got four fixers during the current sale.
---
I got shit.
---
&gt;  went into the sale with maybe 4,500 scrip to spend, and bought with 5 different characters.
---
Ah, I only had ~800 scrip.  :)
---
I mean they can be fun and you can become pretty powerful but if your goal is to be the. Most powerful defenetly not
---
The haunted cabin outside 76 fucked me up. Kept hearing screams and the ground was shaking, and picture was spinning. I found an audio tape, but no other info about it. I was gunna google it to see if there was something to it.
---
Bloodied is good because of all of the defensive perks that synergize with the build, but typically if I’m fighting anyone tougher than an excavator boy I will pop some radaways and get a bit more hp
---
Sounds odd.  What mods do they have?  Are you *sure* they're the same?
---
Hard mass hasn't been scrapped by "scrap all junk" for many, many months.
---
Or when an item like a large defensivr wall shows up green but cant place or other stuff that should be placable but isnt
---
Hmmm I have this perk card that doubles your damage while sneaking (i don’t know the name). But that perk really helped me out. I mostly sneaked and one/two shot almost everything. It did took me the whole evening but hey it was a good evening. Im only lvl 67. I nuked the assaultrons tho, they were hard.
---
Mod for accuracy, two-shot carries an accuracy penalty so you need to make up for it, you should be able to get it as high as 75-79. It adds 25% to base damage but spits total damage between both bullets. Since it actually does fire two projectiles both do 62.5% of the total damage. So yeah if the other bullet goes where ever it feels like you do less damage than any single shot.
---
Sure
---
The most dangerous enemies in the game:  radrats and Colonel Gutsys, everything else is easy.
---
Haha i’m lvl 67 and it took me the whole evening and a bunch of ammo and caps on mini nukes.
---
Ended 4 session with zero disconnects here. No isses and even killed a SBQ with 10-15 other players.
---
Lol that is literally me in every game with dungeons. That’s why it an awesome feeing that I actually did this solo.
---
Assuming this fixes your issue and the game is playable, consider  using port triggering instead of port forwarding.  It’s more secure, but requires you to reserve the ip address of your gaming device, and not all routers support it.  If you have a geek friend, they will know what this is about.
---
Oh one more thing on your screenshot on port forwarding:  that’s just the service definition, so if it still doesn’t work you may have to select something to turn it on (selection box, etc) on the previous screen.
---
Good luck!
---
It’s what they deserve
---
I'm grinding for rare plans and outfits. By the time I have them all I'm hoping wastelanders would have dropped so more to grind.
---
No it isn't
---
Migth be the comunist bundle... that or more sales.
---
Rock solid, fibre optic, other online games are fine
---
I'd like to give a shout out to dienowwww for providing such an honest and reliable service
---
I'd also like to show my appreciation that despite the fact the prices had been raised he still fairly and happily allowed me to purchase the service at the original price agreed
---
The service was quick and simple and despite some issues that were down to the game it was a very good silo run and I enjoyed launching my first nuclear missile
---
What do you want for it?
---
It got me too
---
I think you get 5 minutes from time of log out to log back in. It might be a little longer, but definitely no more than a half hour. 
---
It seems also that if you jump in to a public server immediately after leaving your private server, the private server goes away. I think this because I had a bunch of regular guns sitting in a suitcase at a trainstation to sell to the vendor, but joined public to do a trade, tried to get back on my server but the guns were gone. 
---
Also, what do you mean by "world instance do a full reset"? Do you mean enemy spawns, item spawns, and stuff?
---
Enemies should respawn upon relogging (in the case of farming nuke zones). Items in the world and in containers are tied to your character, and only respawn after x amount of other items are looted. They are not tied to time or instance.
---
Do you mean [this holotape](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/David%27s_holotape) from David to his Mom?
---
I assume the raiders that ransacked the place were somehow transformed into mutants, and after hearing that tape I made sure to get every last one.
---
I have no idea why people like to roleplay as raiders.
---
It's all fake, treehouse nearby has computer to play sounds and effects over and over.
---
I really hope for the communist stuff or something completely new. Daily / Weekly challenges and 1st have brought me nearly 3k of atoms now and there is nothing interesting in the shop for me anymore.
---
You need to play with LGBT+ people?
---
I'd be cool with that. I'm not a PA user on my main character but I like seeing the different styles. And I'm sure they'll be an outfit or two with some weapon paints as well.
---
I would prefer to. I'm a trans woman and shy about my voice and feel a lot safer among people who are also LGBTQA.
---
Im not sure how to tell you this but, yes, yes it is. I had 1, ONE SINGLE disconnect in the past 2 months!
---
Reinstall the game
---
Update your drivers
---
Connect via LAN not WIFI
---
Get a proper pc.
---
I'm at 2400 Atoms myself. Only grabbed a few things recently so I'm about due for a new outfit or weapons paint.
---
Wow thats short. I will try that too. Also switching between public and private.
---
Yes, by "full reset" I mean all the places respawn as much as possible. Relogging doesn't always work. We're often farming flux masses on private servers in whitespring, and mostly a relogin doesn't help them respawn.
---
2 shot isn’t my cup of tea, but if you like it then I’m very happy for you.  High five!
---
I don't think there is a group per say but the discord link is in the sidebar.
---
You dont need to use mic.
---
Thanks! I'm on mobile so it's super hard to see stuff like that.
---
I would prefer to use a mic, I like talking. I'd just feel safer doing so around other members of the LGBTQA+ community.
---
Let me tell you this. Anyone in this community who doesn't accept you for who you are is a dirty commie and deserves the wrath of liberty prime. I don't know what platform you play on but if you see my name feel free to say hello and if you need a teammate I'm your guy. I know plenty of others on this sub will agree
---
Xbox. Sorry
---
Heh, thanks. I'm on PC myself, and will do!
---
I can't speak for the actual mechanics and values, only my own personal experiences. I had my server "timeout" just this morning when I took too much time to relog while switching characters. I got distracted haha. It was only about 5 minutes. 
---
Enemy respawns should work upon relogging. "Should" is the key word here, cause this is a Bethesda game after all haha.
---
I found when farming nuke zones solo, if I leave the cell (the nuke zone), relog, then travel back to the zone all enemies have respawned, every time. It's hit or miss if I relog while still in the nuke zone. I think the presence of another player interferes with it as well, somehow. I have no real proof on that, just one or two times where my relog didn't work while I had a friend sticking around in my server.
---
It's actually very easy to come by you just need to grind a lot
---
I had a guy try dropping nuke mines to kill me a couple days ago.  I’d just come back from scorchbeast hunting, so radshield and diluted rad-x were still active.  He looked so confused after dropping three or four with no appreciable effect.  I gave him finger guns and kept vending.
---
It's just fun. Doing quests, roaming, leveling up, meeting people, helping new people, checking out camps. It's fun to mess with people, sneak on them, follow them around. Sneak to a camp and keep closing people's doors. Find unlocked camps and sleep in thier beds. Etc etc..
---
At one point in a fallout game it's going to get repetitive. That's not a bad thing. I find it fun, which is the point right? Ways to keep it fresh tho. 
---
I'm not bored of it yet and it's been a year so I think it's good. I'm about 1200 in. It's my go to unwind tool.. pack a bowl and I'm a member of the fallout society for awhile. My release.
---
Player trade forums.  If you have good guns with good effects, you can name your price.  There’s a market on Reddit, but mentioning the name is frowned upon for some reason.  Discord, Facebook, etc also have player trading outlets.
---
You should start one if there isn't one already. That is if you really believe that only playing with people you identify with is something positive in itself....
---
I'm glad to hear you were satisfied with the service 😁
---
I'll be running this service until Bethesda finds and patches the simplicity of my methods. 
---
So enjoy it for as long as it lasts!
---
I’d have liked to build in city’s and towns. Like close off a whole street with scrap walls and if anyone needs in they have to pay 30 caps. I could roll play as a raider then.
---
This isn't about me wanting to play with people I identify with, it is that I am extremely insecure about my own identity and have terrible anxiety, and I'm terrified of transphobia, of which I've already experienced quite a bit. Fallout 76 is my break from life, and I'd rather it be a safe space as such. I hope that makes sense.
---
Best I can suggest is turning your modem off for ten minutes and then turning it back on, same with your computer. If that doesn’t work try a different connection like your phones hotspot.
---
Then they found a way to make it unlimited.... For those that pay 
---
L2read.
---
my good man, ill be online in aprox 7 hours. I will add you on PSN when i finish work then hopefully sort it out, thanks :)

You “it can’t be increased because of server stability”. 
---
Them: never said that
---
From recent dataminings I expect communists stuff mainly, but I hope they'll surprise me some way. My 6300 atoms (all from challenges!) can't wait to be spend ;)
---
I’m still waiting for that sweet Nuka cherry armour paints.
---
Well I've been collecting a ful set of assassin's so I hope you are wrong. That would seem to help but 8% might not be enough if that's what you're saying.
---
Unfortunately you're either gonna have to get really lucky and find someone who's willing to just give it to you (even with this attitude) or you're gonna have to suck it up, save up your caps, and then "waste" them on something you've supposedly been wanting since the game came out
---
Nuka Power Armour
---
I have, didn't work well for me, had a nice 3 star vampire weapon. A ladder gat with 250 Dr while reloading so I'm tanky when I'm not shooting. The green lasers look awesome and I was stoked but the health Regen seems lack luster. It must be too slow or does it scale with Dave bc it only does like 35 compared to my 130 on the regular Gatling.
---
I'm surprised they've never done a nuka cola bundle or something. I know I'd really like that nuka cola spinning lamp in the frat house or a Cappy Statue. lol
---
3\* Executioners explosive LMG FFR, 3\* Instigating MM gauntlet faster swing speed +1 strength , 3\* Quad Tesla,  3\* Bloodied Radium rifle ffr +1 agility
---
Dude bro is demanding someone give him something that is, now, even more rare than it was when the event was going around, as opposed to just saving up the caps to buy one from someone. People on Xbox usually put the uniform in their vending machines for like, 5k, and he could definitely find someone on the m*rket to sell one to him for 5k if he really wants it that badly
---
I have the ultracite armor and t60 since it's cheaper sometimes when I'm running low on ultracite. I don't get much notice from vampire honestly
---
Nothing new, probably just sales.
---
Yeah lol. Everyone has been raving about the nuka cola lamp since the release of Wild Appalachia. Come on Bethesda! That would print atoms!
---
By robot vendor you mean at the train station right? The airport one is dead now :(
---
Both
---
What is? :)  What are the best 3\* ranged weapons these days?
---
thx for trying to help. It isn't the connection honestly, it was erroring all over the shop. Logged into a different game no problems, checked my speed while game was running then crashing no problems
---
Bloodied, junkies and maybe furious for stuff with a high rate of fire.
---
You know those rubber balls for pickup trucks?
---
I hope they add them for power armor.
---
ah, ok. Cool
---
So your trying to sell.your item that is not that powerful for the exact amount it was purchased for? Ok... i was just curious
---
&gt; settlements 
---
A bunch of camps with all the same items and services in them is *hardly* a settlement.
---
Lmao. They could charge 5,000 atoms for it and I would buy it.
---
Yea the train station is real close to the airport.
---
I try to do most dailies and weeklies. I also still like doing the Biv and toxic waste quest. But most important I need to get those mr fuzzy tokens!
---
I feel sick I sold my set for 300... Live and learn
---
How many times have you observed this?
---
It could easily be caused by something else if you've only seen it happen once.
---
Like 10 times and each times my corpse went flying.
---
They need to double the budget
---
I wish it was set 'on' by default.
---
Even the people “hating” and complaining on this sub may have 1000+ hours in the game :)
---
PS. If you think this sub is positive... try “Filthy Casuals” sub
---
This looks correct OP. The only caveat is that your PCs internal IP address may be *dynamic* instead of *static* which means it may change every few hours/days.
---
If it does change, the port forward won't work correctly afterwards.
---
I just hit 8400. Haven't used any since I started playing. Not that I'm against atoms, just not a camp builder or an outfit junkie.
---
Already confirmed to be worked on, side note whenever it was mentioned it was also mentioned along with fridges so likely a paid atoms item as well.
---
I also choose very wisely what to buy, usually spend atoms when items are discounted and are going to vault.
---
I wanna nuke that little town in China!
---
Nice job lol!
---
Hey if you need someone to play with on PS4, id be willing to play with you. I just got back into the game.
---
Yeah.... I always imagined having to make a "choice" at the end of the game, and the result being some areas becoming hostile to you, and others working as bases. Like how someone picking BoS could no longer safely enter whitesprings.... But alas!
---
Never said it was impossible bro, relax
---
Counterpoint:  
---
Fast (switchblade, serrated) and some medium (machete, and DCG) vampire weapons are quite effective against most things .... given I have solo taken out lower level SBs that wanted to go toe-to-toe with only the above weapons,
---
 perhaps "vampire on a slow melee weapon is useless" would be a better way to phrase it?
---
For my build, the vampire 50 only does about 20 dmg per hit against SBQ.  Across the same time span, not much better than the switchblade (about 100 per hit), but at least the 50 allows you to stand-off a bit :)
---
I have a hybrid heavy gunner/stealth commando build.  You sacrifice high output damage for utility, but that doesn’t mean you are useless.  I can hold my own against nearly anything and not die.
---
nah fuck that man, you cant be running from noobs like the pic cuz you trans.. 
---
i get it, it is more comfortable with the same peeps, but you gotta be telling noobs they aint shit and they dont mean shit to you so fuck them.. besides, once u find some good people inbetween the noobs, it'll give u the hope that u dont shy away from noobs
---
hope you understand what im sayin
---
I think the "liking" system could be like a tip jar or piggy bank item which would be FREE (Yes, free) from the Atom shop. It would allow people to tip a cap for each time interacted with. Maybe it could also include a counter for overall tips or a tip history to show maybe the last 10 or so players who tipped. And yes, a donation box would be a nice idea.
---
In the long run, probably better off with the bandoleer perk, combined with one of the ammo weight reduction armor pieces.
---
I just wanna spend my free time without having to yell at anyone or be yelled at anyone. I get what you're saying but I'm not a very competitive person.
---
THANK YOU! When I made a post about it I just got a bunch of hate comments saying that if they did that then people like me would argue about server crashing because it would crash the servers 🙄  I have no clue why they say that because I've been playing since release and I never emailed Bethesda or anything about server crashing, bugs, camp building bugs and more
---
all good, maybe you have a idea for me anyways :)
---
In my opinion hybrid between this two is not the best idea - it's usually good to do hybrids where most of SPECIAL can be used by both build - like melee and heavy gunner (STR) or Gunslinger and shooter (PER and AGI). I have my main as heavy gunner and can respec in a seconds for 2h melee.
---
Do whatever makes the game more enjoyable for you. I run a hybrid swapping between shotgun and heavy with a secondary unoptimized commando.  Would I be even tankier and do more damage if I only focused on one? Sure would. As it is though I still kill pretty much everything and haven't died in a really long time.  If you really feel you need to be the absolute biggest badass then stick to one. If you think you'll have more fun as a hybrid then it's totally viable, you'll just be leaving something on the table somewhere.
---
I had to pick it multiple times to get it to register.
---
Grafton dam, grafton steel, the prison, and WV lumber have lots of super mutants.  
---
Pending the day, grafton proper does as well.  Then there is the parade and swarm of suitors....
---
Probably right. It’s just an idea that’s been rolling around for quite awhile
---
How is Bethesda at communicating about the status of their tickets?
---
NP.  I do see your point.   IDK when bandoleer becomes available, so a usable ammo bag might be good for lower level players.
---
I've been using XB1X and SSD for about a month now and I second your claims.
---
Nuclear Winter is still horrible in Morgantown and near the fire though. Also get really bad lag spikes when someone fires a minigun or if there's a lot of automatic fire going on.
---
Another option may be to build two or more separate characters, and create a seperate build type for each.
---
Currently I have four separate characters each with complementary strengths.
---
1. Bloodied-unarmed-shotgun,
---
2. Junkies-Pipe weapon (uses rifle &amp; pistol perks),
---
3. Stealth-Vats-Rifle,
---
4 Power Armour-Alcoholic-Two hand Melee-Heavy weapons.
---
For all of these the perk cards tie in pretty well, with the build and legendary effects on the kit.
---
Would be good for me (lvl 180) too so I can use that Bandolier perk card for something else!
---
Fuck you loser
---
I'd love something like that.
---
Like having the suit come in different color schemes based on Nika Produncs like Grape or Quantum!
---
thank you. id prefer an ingame solution. its not so much about the caps, more like the weapons dont go to waste :) a few caps would be nice obv
---
Seeing different people with connections posting here. I'm on 10/0.6 mbit/s adsl line, playing with wifi on pc and im completely fine. Never had any issues with my private worlds
---
That would be very cool
---
As for the hairdo the problem would be with the helmet.
---
It has this awful red cap inside the space helmet which hides the hair.
---
I get it, it's to prevent longer or bigger hair clipping through, but it looks just bad
---
I'd rather have the helmet 'force shorten' my hair like many hats and beanies do.
---
By that I could at least get somewhat close to the looks of Nuka Girl.
---
So you think they'll ever make it good again? I started to play long after it was nerfed.
---
It's a game about monetization and making things as grindy as possible.  Watch this become a thing in fallout 1st private servers. 
---
Elite players get to build their own town! Grats!
---
I'm on ps4.  I could take some off your hands
---
IIRC, they don't have to be 3\*. 
---
It can be any combination of plain SBs and legendary creatures of any \* level. 
---
How far along the BoS quest line are you?  Line in the sand is good for a couple of points.
---
L43...I don't think I finished OoD until about L60.  Have you completed the Excavator quest?  That will give you some PA which will likely offer better DR when fighting those 1\*'s.  In the process of getting the mats for it, you will likely run across a few of the 10 required.
---
You should also be able to make it through uranium fever - always a couple in there.
---
I'm roaming the map with no particular goal other than working on a couple of the possum badges.  Psn is aj ninetyeight.
---
PS4
---
Nocturnal is pretty nice, just terribly situational. And it seems (not that I disagree) that the fact the the damage/mitigation goes *down* in the day is practically an insult.
---
Anyway, sounds like you've got a pretty good hold of it so far. Maybe someone else will have some advice instead of general encouragement to keep experimenting.
---
I wonder if bgs has more legs to shoot
---
I doubt it , tse weapons were pretty op 😁 i had a quad explosive db that had 1800 pipboy dmg number. 
---
Dont remember the pump &amp; combat numbers
---
Heavy looks like shit.
---
How do you check how much damage you're doing?
---
So what do you think is the inherent flaw with that mode? It is there so why do those pvpers not use it?
---
Oh Blimey! The PP and Encryptid events are pretty fun, but I understand the challenge if you're levelling your character. These events are worthwhile, where the raid.. I'm not sure the rewards are good enough tbh.
---
Because it's Novice difficulty, which is for people **learning** how to play the game mode.
---
Nocturnal has a good damage bonus at night, but has a damage malus during the day. Bloodied, Junkie's, Anti-Armor, Furious are all generally better unless you only play during in-game night.
---
TSE is the one of the worst combinations of damage multipliers for SBQ fights (and not all that great in general), as it splits all that damage increase into 4 separate hits, all of which go through the 70% upfront damage reduction and the high DR of the SBQ. Also, TSE has both a weapon durability (Explosive) and an accuracy (Two-Shot) malus.
---
Could be the purpose of Wastelanders
---
I bought a brand new sealed copy off ebay lastnight for around 20$
---
The group finding tool is a multiplayer game staple. It amazes me that Bethesda still has not implemented it. Or rather, it used to amaze me, before I realized that Bethesda has terrible priorities. We also need text chat, a global trading post, and perk card loadouts.
---
Unarmed: Death claw gauntlet + extra claw, death tambo, meat hook+extra hook.
---
In PA, in order: I like the vampire switchblade (serrated), vampire cultist dagger, vampire machete (sacrificial blade), combat knife (stealth blade), the gutter (electrified), bone club, or an AA sword (blade of bastet, black diamond, or spiked ski sword.
---
The vampire switchblade has been my primary melee weapon for the last..... 90 levels.
---
With power attack, The Gutter can 1 hit a L40 mole miner, but I find it on the slow side for mobs, which is why I prefer the knives.
---
Incisor3, martial artist3, gladiator, glowsight3, lone wandered2, tenderizer1.
---
Optimized servos on PA for +2 str. optimized bracers on the arms for faster AP regen (power attacks)
---
I just got a vampires exploding handmade and a bloodied ultracite gatling laser in the same day, but apart from that it's all been garbage lol
---
I have brain damage reading that mess, holy fuck
---
Link?
---
That's the sprit
---
I might just have to try this.
---
Bethesda,
---
I am really hesitant spending MONEY in the atom shop if I cannot display my purchases. Your build limit is LIMITING the SPENDING I am willing to make with your company. 
---
In the name of PROFITS, please increase the camp budget
---
They have a group finding tool in ESO but not in fo76.
---
And what about SBQ? You think someone who didn't do enough damage (leecher) should get loot from the queen? I don't.
---
And for Uranium Fever it's crap event anyway - the fact that legendaries can't be max lvl render it useless.
---
GameStop was selling it new for $12 price drop from $20.
---
I bought mine from Redbox for $10
---
you can't use search option on ebay site?
---
Cool idea. Really like it but going to focus on what I (!) would do differently
---
* fusion generator inside (attacks, the weather, ...)
---
* find a use for the 'hallway' room. CAMP budget is low enough as it is, might as well use it.
---
* a few things on the walls and floor make a huge difference in ambiance. I like lighted posters because it's two in one (lighting and decoration)
---
* I would remove the posters at your vendors, they get lost because of the vending machines. Too much detail already there for the human eye to really notice the posters
---
* bobblehead display uses too much budget IMHO
---
* a main door into the complex
---
I just stand around in Uranium Fever, play on my phone for 7 minutes and hope I get all of the Jumpsuits drop.
---
But then just like everyone complaining at the scorchbeast event you'll get a bunch of people who show up and just hide and get the rewards without firing a shot. It'd have to come with the same active participation thresholds etc.
---
But yes i agree otherwise - i had my first one ruined on the weekend. Whilst i'm not so much there for the legendaries \[more so the loot\] it irritates me when someone goes out of their way to deliberately ruin an event for jollies.
---
Seriously how many times is this gonna be posted? We get your concerns but nothings going to change
---
I run UF for the scrap and the scrip.
---
It's a waste of time - buy mutation serums you need for couple hundred caps from players vendor or from trading subreddit - fast, easy and reliable. Equip Starched genes and you don't have to worry about the mutations again.
---
alright, did they patch something bc i remember seeing vids of ppl going to bwm and getting mutation after mutation but not server hoping.
---
I don't know, I've never farmed mutation, since it's a waste of time. Serums are so cheap now that I wouldn't care less about farming them "conventional" way...
---
And the other 3+ vaults and various locked buildings.
---
Lately on Xbox, many are attacking as soon as the public events complete, specifically Scorched Earth, where dying means you lose your Flux from the event rewards.
---
To counter this I have begun stashing the rewards immediately after killing the SBQ, even before looting anything, then I'm free to waste the A$$hats without fear of losing anything, as I always come out net positive on caps.
---
Over time I have come to enjoy a bit of PvP, and am currently playing a character that's well suited for it, I never start fights, but also seldom shy away from one either, unless grossly out numbered, with my favorite activity being to find the ones trying to bait others with a low level wanted player, we found just such a group last week, and along with a couple of friends, we killed them all several times, and leveled 2 of their camps, before the blocked us &amp; server hopped, we are basically the Anti-Griefers.
---
Buying specific mutation serums for ranged or mele builds is better than random Mutation farming.
---
Buying carefully chosen mutation serums from player vending machines is the way to become mutated now.
---
Well most people who play solo consistently (like myself) run Lone Wanderer so by joining your team im actually weaker and less AP.
---
What a game to get for a price like that some lucky people right here
---
Have you tried putting it into the thanksgiving display case?  I have put other helmets and headgear in it.  I haven't tried PA yet.
---
Is the event system still changed to where it’s only 1-3 every 30-40 minutes? I haven’t played in a long time because of that change.
---
They mentioned awhile ago (I think it was QuakeCon) that they are working on overhauling the event rewards. So that you no longer need to hit to get loot and maybe performance based rewards.
---
I see no reason to visit V76 again, but I would appreciate if they'll open other vaults to be available for exploration (V51, V94 and other that are on the map, like 63 or 96).
---
I power levelled a second character by going to Whitespring entrance, running up to the cabins and tagging a few ghouls and then running back to the whitespring entrance to let the sentry bots take care of them. If a sentry bot gets close to dying, tag them quick for more XP and then server hop to reset aggression.
---
Last night I had two dudes in turkey outfits staring at the floor in prone position blasting the floor with their Tesla's... Had to be quick to score any hits for xp let alone legendary hits.
---
A radio station, something like hunter/hunted, that you can tune into when looking for other players to team up with, would be great. Other players tune in and auto join your team.
---
I see no reason to change the sound that is in game now. It’s cool
---
I would probably say the best Gauss rifle legendary would be a Bloodied 25% reload Light weight
---
I've done two with a partner and one solo. The solo run was a lot less frustrating, and honestly much less intensive in terms of ammo and aid used. Mainly because I tend to sneak and only kill when necessary, where my partner is a run and gun type.
---
45 minutes, less than 100 rounds of 5.56, and maybe 2 diluted stims later I had a nuke inbound. And all without PA.
---
Yea OP is literally asking Bethesda to make a useless weapon type even uselesser 🤮
---
Me to then. :-)
---
And i have 240 levels in this game.
---
I thought they were Rocks with Ultracite in them.
---
Awaits  all the incoming abuse from the super intelligent Gamers.
---
Not really -90% doesn't work correctly, FFR is pointless since it isn't an automatic &amp; two shot doesn't always work in vars
---
Is the annoying "did I buy a limb mod, or a chest mod, let me roll the dice" thing still a thing? Or are they marked now? I gave up on my set of Scout armor after buying the "wrong" mod too many times...
---
I was going to say marine too lmao but I wasn't 100%
---
I haven't tried putting stuff in world containers, as I have multiple accounts, and run 2 Xboxes, I've never needed to, but on private worlds I have seen a drop bag remain for several hours as long as the character that dropped it remains. I along with a few friends kept one private world active for over 8 hours with 12 active workshops and dropped 9 nukes before the server shut down for maintenance. Joining the world with different characters on my second Xbox allows us to respawn enemies in locations like White Springs,
---
Not ‘god roll’ but still good. Most of my sbq rewards are made of wood.
---
I just do it to hit my daily scrip.
---
Run in, spray and pray while someone does all the killing.
---
The games already too easy, lets def not reward possibly non participating with loot. They NEED make event bosses harder so its alive LONGER so one asshole is less likely to one shot and steal all rewards.
---
Power armor mod plans will eat thru your excess caps really quick. Camden Park robot vendor has all the excavator ones, and (I think) Phoenix down in Watoga has the 45 and 51 plans
---
You need to try an IE Handmade, they’re great.
---
Would love a donation box to get rid of all my useless garbage that I don't want to throw away.
---
Now I just price things at like 10 caps. But some high level people always buy them out instead of a newby.
---
I even moved my camp close to Vault 76.
---
All ideas are good overall.
---
Boy do I have some good news for you! 
---
You might try taking a look at the Inside the Vault newsletters when they come out, as well. Just a friendly bit of advice.
---
There's also the "Souvenir Mug", "Mem-R-Ies"(spelling?), and "Souvenir Bowl", plus the cups and the Nuka-Cola outfits.
---
Really dude?
---
The only real way is to take the note map and have each person in your team take a spot and memorize all the potential spots in that area.  [https://imgur.com/GexPV64](https://imgur.com/GexPV64)
---
Explosive 50 Cal,and a 90 % reduced weight Grenade launcher that always comes in handy on the last doorway of the Nuke run .
---
The Doorway to the Main Frame Cores  that you need to repair.
---
I always lob a few Grenades in there to kill all the enemies.
---
I tried to help out in the scorch beast queen event but my contribution was equivalent to the kid that tastes the cookie dough. I was there, but nothing would’ve turned out different if I wasn’t there
---
No kidding? It wasn't listed in the description so I didn't try it. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Best (most balanced) armor sets are Heavy Combat Armor or Scout Armor. Both can be modded with deep pocketed but for CA you need to learn a plans (available in Grafton vendor) while for scout armor all mods are only available as boxes from Military Wing Enclave vendor.
---
Two shot used to be the gold standard, when both projectiles did 100% base damage.  In Fallout 4, it’s so strong.  In 76 it was nerfed last winter, yet still has the condition and accuracy drawbacks.
---
In my opinion, two shot is pretty low on the list for sniper weapon effects.  I’d prefer furious or vampire, even.
---
The double projectile spread is not ideal for long range shooting.  Since the damage is split equally, and the effect adds +20% or so to base damage, you actually do less damage than vanilla if only one hits.  Aiming does help, but you’re still likely to only get one hit on a long distance headshot.  The accuracy penalty also makes damage drop off at range much more significant, which again is not ideal for a sniping tool.
---
Two shot is alright if things are less than ten yards/meters away.  It’s beneficial for a close range, full auto play style.  Something like a  10mm SMG or 50cal is pretty decent with two shot.
---
The god roll weapons at the moment are bloody, junkie and possibly furious and vampire, depending on the weapon.  Faster fire, faster swing and explosive are typically the most desirable secondary effects, but it depends on the weapon.  In my opinion, a b/aim sniper weapon is ideal.  Unlike explosive, the +10% bonus seems to apply after all other modifiers.  If you make a 5000 point headshot, totally possible on a bloody gauss, the aim effect will add 500 damage.  Overkill for the most part, but when you’re aiming at a sheepsquatch, it’ll be enough to put it down in one headshot.
---
Future expandability.  You can't build out everything at once if you want a multi-year expandable world.
---
Y'all need Fallout 1st. Nobody rushes events. 😎
---
As soon as I hit level 45 and was able to use my two shot Explosive, the only problem I had with the silo run was finding the mainframe pieces.
---
Yea and all those pool cues seem to suggest that i should be playing something else 😵
---
what like vendors and script? I think its 20 hours after you last first used it. say you woke up at 10 am and started using them then the next day it will be a 6 am or something like that.
---
Assuming just PvE which has a DR Bias - Heavy BoS Combat Torso, with Polymer Scout Legs.
---
The Plans for Heavy Combat armour are availble from the BoS Vendors (Whitesprings and Watoga) the plan for BoS upgrade from the same AND from the 3 Responder Vendors (Whitesprings, Camden and Grafton (Town not station)
---
Scout Armour are reward drops only of from the Purveyor. Mods (Only, no Plans, Polymer and Deep Pockets) are from the Military wing in the Bunker. The Polymer mod will set you back up to 1500 caps each depending on CHA and Hard Bargin, Deep pockets is 500 (I think)
---
It does that's what's driving my sneaks up at night it goes from base 88 to 203 according to pipboy for the nocturnal to take effect and then my sneaks are doing around 733 damage. I'm extremely happy with the Sandman/covert Op combo and have used sandman since I went to 15 agility so I was over the moon when I seen it was stacking.
---
Anyone know they fixed the bug with it? I HATE getting stuck doing no damage with any ranged weapon for hours. I fire it in half mag bursts to avoid the bug
---
Sometimes it be like that, sometimes it's an 30 minute gorefest.
---
20 hours after your first scrip and sell they will reset.
---
Like it's like the big green boz for settlement from fallout 4. Where anyone can build anything.
---
Not gonna lie, that's hella dumb. You'd have to give human players a MASSIVE leg up on muties and ghouls, because otherwise the radiation/disease resistance would mean there's no point in playing anything other than an abomination.
---
My favorite activity is murdering the Tesla wielding wanna-bees, my full heavy leather armor set gives me very high energy damage resistance.
---
733? Wow. Very nice
---
Nocturnal wouldn't be so bad if it weren't worse than baseline during the day.  Berserker has a similar problem.
---
I at least tried to do damage, I popped on a hazmat suit and grabbed a pipe revolver and started blasting. I tried to go in with a combat shotgun whenever it landed
---
All good. Surprised me too
---
This is literally something they've already said they're looking to implement as part of the further additions to the new event system alongside actually rewarding people for participation over just attending an event.
---
It would take BGS sometime to implement that. It would honestly be easier to just turn up the regular local Xmas radio stations while playing lol
---
I believe there are unopened strangler bloom pods and they are considered swamp plants
---
My internet sucks but i can play other online on other game like gta
---
Good news is Bethesda stated they planned to add that to public events where you still can get legendary drop even if you don't tag it but bad news is originally slated this year was moved to next year during 2020 Q1 last I checked when they mentioned it inside the vault articles.
---
I agree about 90%.
---
I believe if you tag anything or do let's say do 50DPS on enemies(enemy) then you should get the poor.
---
If you don't tag anything at all or contribute then you shouldn't.
---
But yea I agree tbf
---
so would u like to get an instigating explosive with faster reload combat rifle?
---
I thinks the percentages are multiplicative and not additive, so 60%+50% is only 90% not 110%
---
Go back to fortnite
---
I'm curious how Berserkers works to be honest I've never even ran into a player who runs a Berserkers build to find out how it works.
---
Cool. We are already friends lol not sure if I'll be on today but best advice I can give is: go solo on novice. It's not timed so you can take your time and learn where shit is. And a nice bonus you can grab all that acid from crickets
---
This is pretty much how I play my game except I craft whatever stuff I have the requirements for 🤣👍
---
Where is ur camp
---
I kind of think that, at least prior to Wastelanders, that's kind of the point.
---
You're in the Vault and you get all of this cheerleading about how you're going to go out and rebuild America, only to find that everyone who tried before you is dead.  And the plague that killed them?  You don't cure it.  The best you can do is contain it.
---
Like, when you stop and think about it, that's kind of brutal.
---
Hey maybe its the Wastlanders DLC &amp; they are surprising us so early with it.....probably not but a guy can dream. lol
---
That's actually really smart, do you have any recommendations or pointers for particular pieces of said armour?
---
Oh hey, look at that. I didn't even check your reddit ID. Haha. Sounds good man!
---
Awesome, you guys sound like cool folk and I’d love to run around with ya at some point. Feel free to give me an add on psn - Wulfzer
---
Yeah and I have to be honest it's the most amount of damage I have ever done. I actually whooped out loud when I seen it for the first timeheck of a difference between 500 (expected sneak damage) and 733 I was blown away.
---
If yer on XBox1 I got marsupial serums. Currently set at over priced cause numbers keep buying them all up to resell(good luck morons nobody gonna buy them at 1k a pop)
---
I think they could add Generic NPC's that walk around cleaning or trading with others. Also, Free travel! It would become a player hub
---
Honestly I think the tagging behavior encourages people to avoid getting too engaged in trying to kill mobs and instead run around with some gun specially designed to help get tags (fast firing, automatic, accurate, shit for damage).  
---
People are complaining about others not actually contributing on events and not realizing that the way the current system works is that it encourages it.  Getting away from that allows people to just participate and not worry about tags/loot.
---
there is not maintenence/update sheduled for today. also the puveyor event runs for another 1,5 hours and i have no update on PC. sooo...no idea what you are downloading
---
Theres no update?????
---
Thanks have a good one
---
This better be content and not just because they screwed something up.
---
How are the sizes on PS4 and PC?
---
You can double stack unarmed and one handed perks for it.
---
You too.
---
Same here. No atom shop update either, so maybe it's just them?
---
That was a different experiment and a different strain.  I don't believe it has been confirmed snallygasters were once human only that they have some human DNA and were created with the help of the FEV virus.  Huntersville all ended up super muties.
---
I would not run life giver and definitely get that armor played backpack mod
---
Lol typo, I would not run ironclad
---
I don't really like the idea :/ we have mutation already, maybe they can make visual effects to mutations. But some things are not lore friendly at all. For exemple mutant that look like female, super mutant don't have any gender. They are all muscular and shit but there's no male or female, they "reproduce" by contaminating people with a FEV. Feral gouls and glowing ghouls can't be conscious/friendly due to the ultra high radiation melting their brain.
---
Also, super mutant are immune to radiation, they heal very fast too.
---
It's not easy to come by. The most important is a chest piece you can add the dense mod to.  This keeps you alive in explosions and safe from explosive guns.  You probably have it for leather, vendors charge up to 10k for the dense mod plan for the heavy armors.
---
I run alot, so I'm always after ap gear. Also like the poison resistant stuff, helps tons with mirelurk queens. Between this and the dense mod, I'm impervious to scorchbeasts as well.
---
Took about a month to collect the full marine ww set I have.  And it's not yet all perfect pieces.
---
And? If someone wants to make an ass of themselves let them. The game is rated M after all.
---
Lmao I am on Xbox one my tag is dark phantom 30
---
I don't have a download waiting
---
Sounds like you're reinstalling the whole game...
---
I’ve had the same experience as you many weekend days where I run a world all day long. 
---
This past weekend I launched a fresh nuke in a private server and had the server not responding notification minutes after the nuke landed, after being in the server less than an hour. 
---
I’m also XB1.
---
yea so true. i have way to many legendaries. Scrip where for art though scrip!?!
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
Turrets going haywire?
---
Ahh ok, you're not doing too bad then. Crops can definitely take up a lot of budget even if there are only a few, so that might be your best target to clear up budget.
---
I use all BOS Heavy with Ultralight limbs and 3 have wwr, one has aid reduction, just need to find one more lol...more of a bitch then it seems. Same boat, cant use PA on that toon, but comes in handy when i get stuck in players fondations or to break in lol. All my pieces are chalmelion except my chest, this definetly helps, all pieces do stack and is a godsend. My chest is a asbestos lined  so im not set on fire in peoples traps and against those pesky energy weapons. Yeah i just sit there and wait for all your stuff to break so i can ft out to come back and say hi lol. It also depends on your perks and what kind of build you have. The one i just explained is for my vats commando, but because of my armor im barely ever seen and can hold a arsenal on me at all times weighing in at 205 lbs so i can use my armored backpack and shielded harness with a energy resistance close to 600 and ballistic close to 450. If you really want to go even crazier in the defense dept you can also look into the damage % removal perks/armor, but that requires more math lol. Hope i somewhat helped 😊
---
I have 2 distinct builds that I run, and although they play with significant differences, they both perform very well;
---
* Build 1 (Level 346), Full Health, Stealth Rifleman/Heavy weapons, uses PA &amp; AAFFR 50 Cal for SBQ &amp; Imposter battles, maintains Stealth 90% of the time.
---
   * Specials: S8, P12, E4, C3, I6, A15, L8
---
   * Armor: Vanguard's/Chameleon Heavy Combat, with WWR &amp; +AGI
---
   * Weapons: Instigating Explosive +AGI mostly
---
* Build 2 (Level 200), Bloodied, Stealth Rifleman/Heavy weapons, uses PA &amp; Bloodied FFR LMG for SBQ &amp; Imposter battles, maintains Stealth 60% of the time.
---
   * Specials: S10, P10, E6, C4, I6, A12, L8
---
   * Armor: Bolstering/Chameleon Heavy Leather, WWR, AGI, STR, RR
---
   * Weapons: Bloodied Exp/FFR, all ballistic ranged.
---
Although the Bloodied build maintains slightly higher damage numbers, my full health character is actually much easier to play, having better Stealth, and the ability to one hit most enemies, and almost never die. I have the ability to Solo the SBQ with either, and the Imposter with my Vanguards build, but not the Bloodied, as he can't Tank the Pylons. Handmades are my preferred weapon on both characters, but also use Lever Actions a lot, &amp; switch to pistols in low level areas, team play can mess up your Stealth in some areas (particularly Public events), so I will sometimes go "Lone Wanderer" so I can maintain Stealth for maximum damage. Perk Card loadout is significantly different when switching to heavy weapons, but the Special points balance works equally well for both.
---
All modded armors  can have Deep Pocketed applied, excluding Wood armor of course since it can't have any utility mods at all.
---
If you're looking to mitigate damage your best bet would probably be to worry less about your DR than on the perks you're using.  You're going to avoid a lot more damage using perks like Dodgy to reduce your damage taken or Serendipity to flat out avoid some damage when your health is low enough.
---
When it comes to the armor itself you should probably be focusing more on the legendary effects you have available.  Ideally you want the best effects on the best armor... but the odds of those lining up are rare, if you can get a three star leather chest that provides all the legendary effects you want it's likely going to serve you better in the long run than a heavy BOS combat armor chest with crap legendary effects.
---
I think we need ethier separate high lvls from the new people under lvl50
---
Except weightless and reload are both tertiary effects.
---
I have Dash boarded a few times from private worlds, but that's actually an XBL regional server issue, I don't recall being DC'd from a Private world ever.
---
Second UF. 3 legendaries and you’re off to whitespring to tag some more. 
---
Yesterday I got 1 at WS, the 3 at UF, did one violet night for the other 6.
---
The first on looks like a sniper version of a 10mm pistol xP i lile both.
---
Why not 24 its the max player count on a server right ?
---
I keep a pet Scorchbeast
---
(Well, not really. I live next to a fissure. I've almost always got one flying around. We have an understanding).
---
If you played NV then it's the anti-materiel rifle, hit like a truck and had these bad boy explosive rounds.
---
Now that you mention it I remember :p
---
But aren't the rewards for those legendaries like 40 and below? I would understand farming lower level legendaries but if your looking for max level things hit up another event.
---
\+50% at 0DR
---
Honestly, I've never heard of an online game where you have to hit the enemies to get credit. It's a ridiculous system. Literally every online game I've played, if you're in a group with other players, you all get credit (not necessarily full credit, but you get credit) for anything that your team kills. That goes for XP and loot. Same for when you're in an event with other players. Why Fallout 76 doesn't work this way, I'll never know. It's like the makers of the game have never played an online game before. And based on the "survival" mechanics, they've never played a survival game either. And based on how PvP works, they've never played a PvP game before. It's just a mess.
---
Missile launchers.  BOOM!
---
With all the one shot kills from bloodied weapons I say the moment your bullet or melee makes contact with any trash mob you should automatically be able to loot the spawned legendary. Events are over before you've even had a chance to buff up. The AFK argument is just silly at this point.
---
Do they usually die in one headshot. No regenerating health.
---
If you're going to nitpick someones comment, you should at least know what you're talking about. Uranium Fever has not always been a Public event.  Public events only came about as of Patch 13.
---
The game says it's about rebuilding, but it's not. It's about doing whatever you feel like doing.
---
Thank you, I plan on updating it as I go along in the wasteland!
---
Same boat I'm in.  L156, and weigh several hundred pounds less out of PA, but have low DR.
---
Marine wetsuit underarmor, which I think is DR 4.
---
I have a L50 non legendary chest piece that I've managed to modded up to DR 71.  I want to say its Marine combat armor with a fiberglass mod, but I could be wrong.  (I know its not dense.)
---
I can get DR higher, but have to give up the deep pockets to do it.
---
Appendage armor is all L50 mixed legendary, with junk, ammo, food/chem, and I think a weapon weight reduction.  One is chameleon.  IIRC, the others are mutant (not slayer), zealots, and scout.  All have been modded for pockets.
---
 Alas, here's the DR problem - none of the appendage armor is above 35 DR.   Not great for a melee build.
---
Spent a lot of scrip @ Murgph last night on armor, but didn't had the opportunity to start modding to see if I can improve the numbers.
---
None of the plans/mods I have were purchases - All the mod/mod plans I have were found, looted, or event awards.
---
Hold on, brb, I need to go puke out these serums.
---
Part of the reason is probably that their decade old engine can’t handle anything beyond the build limit and especially with everyone on the server having an extended build limit, the servers would crash.
---
&gt;The airport one is dead now :(
---
Huh? What? Why? How? Why?
---
Vault 75 being closed makes no narrative sense. If you have a minute number of people and their purpose is to rebuild society, it makes no sense to not have a safe space to be able to come back.to that has food, water, clean beds, medical supplies, etc.
---
I'm on PS4!
---
Nocturnal does good enough damage but you'd still do more with a bloodied gun at night with the Sandman perk.
---
FYI: Douche.
---
yes no regeneration
---
During the Halloween event the same thing happened to me at least three times, and happened to my partner too - I'm on Xbox, she's on PC. Definitely not just an isolated incident for OP. However, I haven't seen it happen since then.
---
I’ve seen people complain about this since launch, I’m not saying they are wrong but you need to compromise. I’ve done large builds and had bigger ideas from the start but then need to find solutions while I scale down. Done double wall (white) Pantheon, bos walled of base x2 wall high with rocket tower + fire platform , floating warboat base with full defense and more.
---
I want the game fixed first. You can't have a multi-year expandable world if the game.itself doesn't function properly.
---
I’ll help out add me on Xbox one FrienofthedeviL can tank the Sheepa w my troubleshooter armor set and VE 50 cal if someone else can activate the pilons
---
Probably steroid laced cheese creating super powered radrats.
---
Damn autocorrect was late again
---
Oh good call. I was not expecting to get killed in just a couple hits by one. Lesson learned, screw the Mire.
---
Don't do the event if you can't do it solo? 
---
Ask people before hand to help, pretty sure you can drop a thread here asking for people to join you there would be takers.
---
It's a well know bug. If you die at the end of any event,  you cannot respawn anywhere. Your options are to wait for the boss to despawn or restart the game. It happens constantly at the SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
Same thing just happened to me. Two people just there to kill robots. I died and the game isn't respawning me .. not freezing or anything. Game still runnin but infinite load screen .. anyone else have a fix for this or know why it's happening ? Happened at the queen last night too now that I think about it.
---
I like this idea.  if i see a public event with good legendary drop potential, but a few people already there, i just skip it.  But if they were more difficult, i'd actual be glad to see others there to help AND I'd be able to get a hit on the legendary.
---
Not into that heavy breathing it makes?
---
Anything with bloodied or an explosive round effect can sell in your vendor for a few 1000 caps, but I'd say the 2shot faster fire plasma is probably the best one, seen those go for a lot on discord
---
I hate when legendary sheepsquatch disappear on me after killing them! Has happened at least 3 times. Usually in the cranberry bogs. It makes my blood boil!
---
2 Raids were planned... Vault 79 is another story.... people are asking for the frozen animals raid...
---
I wish they implemented something like this, i just want a cool looking and hard hitting sniper.
---
My desire would be something like a ww1 or ww2 sniper, elegant, hard hitting and with a killer meaty sound, but thats just my preference.
---
yeah snipers have been left out, but I'd prefer bethesda to bring in an awesome energy sniper as the sniper conversions for the laser and plasma rifles suck ass
---
Hole in one.
---
I'm on ps4 as well; I'd love to check some out if you're on in the evenings.
---
They never announced 96, that was a leak.
---
The furious FFR Gatling gun is nice.
---
Now that though was excellence. But would need a quick key for a**holes to be kicked of the team/server + banned in the gaming world for life and beyond
---
I've tired of shooting the SB queen and not getting any loot.
---
Turrets, a berserker builds biggest weakness. How dare they be made in real life.
---
It's just part of gaming.  On my own nuke, a guy melted the queen b4 I got there. In UF, some guy wants to play badass...sucks.
---
If everyone played the kind-hearted role, the game would lose diversity which makes it more fun. Personally, I fall on the side of trust and empathy...gotten screwed several times, but that's who I am.
---
I assume this post holds true to this day, considering Bethesda’s track record on bugs. I wanted to ask, when countering Tesla spammers, should I just throw on regular heavy leather armor if I don’t have any legendary variants, so as to try and get my energy resistance as high as possible? I have several sentinel assassin pieces, but unfortunately they don’t have the best energy resistance.
---
Yeah, ok, add them to the list.
---
It’s all fake. Follow the power lines and you’ll find a terminal where you can control it all.
---
For a real spook, go to Haven Church way our west. Mysterious organ playing at night (no organs in the game) and no real explanation for it
---
He is essentially the "mascot" for the earlier Pip-Boy 2000 that we have in-game. The "mascot" for the Pip-Boy 3000 is the Vault Boy that we all know and love.
---
It was on the roadmap before they updated it... there were two raids planned for summer... they must have canceled the last one becauses people were not playing the first raid...
---
Vendor caps and script machines are on a 20 hr clock.  World containers and static junk spawns operate on a different mechanic.  These last two operate based on how many unique containers or spots you have looted before returning to the previuosly looted spot.
---
Lol. They reworked the airport layout and added some notes and holotapes to show an epic last stand battle took place where everyone died basically. It’s actually pretty cool, but sad the vendor had to die in the process.
---
I'm plucking the number 10 out the air really. Not everybody will want a plot close to each other with no resource nodes and the servers probably crash at the idea of 24 camps close together. It would be down to play testing for them to find out what we could get away with.
---
I would love the help but sadly im on PS4. Thanks for the offer though.
---
I run a commando/rifleman build as well. 
---
FWIW, if you haven't compared all the perks... most of the time when exploring/farming, I don't run quite so min/maxed.  My std build-out is 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f336eb&amp;d=sv3pg2ph2pp2pi2e11eh0c71a72ar2a51a02l71lt2li2lu2ic4ii0p00p40p30an2&amp;w=&amp;m=51c249fe6&amp;nw=&amp;n=Ash's%20Commando%20Explorer
---
Generally I roll around with a non-legendary 50th level fixer (powerful automatic) and it takes most things down with one to three hits.  I also have a furious armor piercing powerful automatic handmade... I usually find the fixer does better, but depending on the creature, the handmade is good.  Furious hasn't been as good for me as I thought it would be -- it caps out at +50% damage.
---
Variants:
---
* I shuffle the strength &amp; int perks if I switch to a heavy gun &amp; PA (scorchbeast).
---
* If I want to maximize this build I'll drop the perceptibobble/panni whatever and maximize concentrated fire.
---
* I have an instigating refined .50 hunting rifle with explosive and vats crit.  If I want to use it for thumping on things, I switch commando to rifleman, and drop gunsmith to have a maxed demolitions expert.  With that spec I can drop ~2500 on a good hit.  I haven't really tried min-maxing with the right time of day and aid bumps, I think it'd be cool to try at some point.
---
I also have a few pieces of armor i'll shift around depending on what i'm doing.
---
I think it's a pretty good universal build.  I have two alts and I'm playing with bloodied melee and a heavy gunner.  Honestly, I prefer the commando build.  It's better "all around."  Sure, it can't do some crazy sky-high one-shot, but I can come fairly close, and it's a more universal build-out.  I've had people talking about their bloodied builds doing 2k damage in one hit--I can do that with my thumper, so :)
---
This is amazing! I know I'm late to the thread, but does anyone have any build suggestions? Aside from rifleman and gunslinger what other perks are must haves?
---
I figured it out that when I harvest strangler xxxx, sometimes an unique item "swamp plant" will be put in my backpack in parallel. What a strange design.
---
Tse 10mm
---
Bloody explosive pipe revolver
---
Furious ffr fixer
---
Bloody ss sledge hammer
---
i’m on ps4 too, what’s your psn?
---
If I had a little more time, I probibly could have done it but I ran out of time before I could kill the imposter sheepsquatch.
---
There is a thanksgiving display case, that is just a fancy shelving unit with no glass.  It's slick, and you should get it if you haven't.
---
Why do you hate America?
---
But it makes it fire 25% faster, so it's not useless. It'd be useless on a harpoon gun
---
Ive gotten the infinate loading screen. At least someone showed up.
---
Don’t you have to charge a gauss rifle?😂😂
---
No you can just fire it
---
Can try with you in 3 or 4 hours if that works for you. Have a keycard and probably a teammate or 2 usually on 3 hours or 4 hours from now...
---
We need an Armor penetration card for pistol and shotgun like every other gun... idk it feels like only thing viable is heavy and rifle i love pistols i really wanna use them more
---
Oh yeah? And how’s that damage?
---
It's not pointless on semi auto though
---
I'm not fond of the mistress of mystery storyline either, to be honest.  It had good potential, but it was just too close to a trope/cliche.  I think it is, in part, because of the painful way they have to tell a story (notes and holotapes).  But also just not great writing.
---
They should have mannequins like in skyrim you you could display anything from power armour to the miners outfit and everything in between
---
To be honest now that I think about it my vendors should have reset by now. Anyone else having issues?
---
I  usually run with a stupid pipe rifle that does almost no damage at all but enough to tag and i call others if i see a legendary and it happens to me a lot too to be honest, that community is cool.
---
Anyway...i run into those kind of ppl too that oneshot the legendary and care of nothing and noone :(
---
Are you suggesting that Gauss rifles do poor damage? Get a load of this guy
---
I had a real choice one last night. I think he was upset I didn't raise to his bait. Racial slurs, childish degrading remarks, threats to keep following me from server to server, etc.  I'll get the video uploaded eventually, it was something else :)
---
No, bruh. Charging it gets you more damage. What are you even talking about. Why you vouching for ffr on a gauss 😂😂😂 it’s essentially useless
---
Because that is what the number (26) from the original comment applies to, it is the base damage of a level 50 pipe gun, so I pointed that out.
---
* cough cough* yeah it is.... 😂
---
I’m only saying wasting because people will overprice a small item because it was part of an event or because it’s legendary. I’ve seen a one star legendary exterminators pipe revolver for 900 caps
---
So true on all accounts. When you look at the atomic shop and all the resource caps on everything single thing in the game (storage space, vendor daily caps, total caps, daily scrip, total scrip, etc) it is fairly obvious they have played some p2w mobile games though.
---
Don't forget Sad Trombone!
---
I’m not demanding anything. I’m just pointing out how ridiculous prices are for something simple like an outfit
---
Past negative experiences have trained me to ignore rando invites, normally though depending on which character I'm on I'll scan the map to find the person and if it's a level 20 in a spot I know is rough I'll travel and help them out, but not join their team.
---
If it's a level 342 spamming my low level invites, I'll completely ignore it.
---
I’ve never really had 5k so I’ll try to save up some
---
Better dead than red!
---
It's very important to get some people together before you start the event. I usually announce it after a Queen fight, most often after the third nuke. 
---
I think a lot of players are open to teaming up. Your schedule of activities gets smaller and smaller, sepecially at higher levels. Hit those players up and make some preparations.
---
Better luck next time!
---
LOL - yeah but you're there, you're trying, you're part of it - that's all good, i don't think anyone would complain at that.
---
Not asking for a handout, just a reasonable trade or price
---
It also allows you to put six items instead of four in one case, and is more vertical than horizontal, which lets you put more cases in a building. My collection museum is virtually all Thanksgiving cases. They are brilliant for the compulsive collector like me.
---
Thanks for offering it anyway
---
I could really want an explosive double barrel but I’m not going to waste 10000 caps on it because it’s an extremely high price for something that’s really not worth it
---
Maybe you should stick to single player games. Just because the market values an item at a certain price and you don’t agree with said price does not mean people need to sell it cheaper. I bet you are one hell of a person to sell a car to. 
---
Fucking cheapskates.
---
There will also be a major balance pass and "normalization" of the game coming with Wastelanders, which will level the field between high and low level players, especially at events. All these changes are probably meant to work together, and I guess that is one of the reasons why all will be introduced at once in 2020.
---
Some people price things wrong but to agree with market value is being cheap.
---
This is still happenint? I havent played in months and almost logged in yesterday.
---
Back before I was vaguely able to do damage to the queen I just focused on running around reviving people and clearing the hordes of trash mobs.
---
Suddenly Ham 
---
Gonna get on really soon.
---
It depends on playstyle and mutations.  Do you mostly VATS then Crit, if ADS Faster reload.  If you have the speed demon mutation I am not sure if the fr has much effect, so crit.
---
I broke my pipe revolver in the process so I would agree that I at least contributed to the effort, even if my contribution was just throwing pebbles at the damn thing
---
Two raids were announced by Bethesda, and only one released. 
---
I don't particularly care that they failed to release one, but that failure is factual, so you can't just dismiss it. :P
---
I’m not being cheap, I just don’t have enough caps and would rather trade a legendary, because those go for way more
---
The mole miners are also kids
---
Haha we were all running around picking flowers while the queen zinged is last night. About 8 of us brought the pain. Fun times.
---
Why didn’t you remove the message description? You say you have wanted this since the release of the beta but you DONT have 5k caps saved up? Come on bro.
---
The vats crit fill handmade is much better, not as good as less vats Cost but only by a margin and arguably possibly better if you’re good at managing AP anyway and wearing powered pieces, allows to free up four lear clover in luck or just points out of luck in general, faster reload would probably come in third place because it’s not noticeably THAT much faster.
---
Poor bastard.
---
I have to check that out tho
---
Then trade a legendary for it. If you have one, trade it. You are making yourself sound very, very cheap.
---
They've been getting better for sure, fewer new bugs per patch and they haven't brought back any old bugs in a long time, but you still see a few new bugs or exploits come around. That would be fine, but they haven't patched several bugs that people have asked about for months and they've literally done nothing to deal with hackers in Nuclear Winter. Frankly I'm only still playing cuz I want to get some good Legendaries to use in Wastelanders and to level up so I can take advantage of that legendary player system if it ever releases.
---
I’m not cheap, I just don’t have enough caps to spend on it. I would rather make a legendary trade than waste caps on it because I’m always low on caps
---
Then make a post H: Legendary Offers W: Fireman Outfit
---
Don’t make a discussion about it. Fuck Sake
---
Thanks for this.
---
I just can't stand people like this in general. I was doing a horde event and fast traveled to 3/4 locations before locating the horde boss. Some guy showed up in full sneak mode and stealth boy activated and just 1 shot everything in sight before I had an opportunity. He certainly knew I was there too. Thanks guy.
---
i have one xtra one on PS4 also have 6 cards on me that will behappy to do it
---
&gt;It's like the makers of the game have never played an online game before.
---
It's more likely that it's too difficult for BGS to code in proper Team mechanics, so we have what we have - because it was easier.
---
Just because people have misinterpreted what I said doesn’t mean that I’m cheap.
---
Nothing says holiday spirit like communist China gear
---
Thinking of that era, I'd like one of those scopes that follow almost the full length of tbe barrel. Not sure of the irl practicality but they look pretty out there so would deff fit with the setting.
---
I’m not a regular on this sub mate stop getting so mad about it
---
We misinterpreted what you posted because you were not saying what you meant bro. 
---
And we didn’t misinterpret. You are cheap and pissed people are selling market value items at market value
---
I'd well believe it I'm just intimidated by the build, not going to lie, lol.
---
If you are level 50, all legendary drops should be level 50. All gear that drops as level 45 should be 50, why is 45 even the cap on some weapons?
---
Weaker weapons need to have their baseline damage increased to be competitive with other weapons in the same class. Why go to the purveyor and one person can get a power fist while another person can get knuckles, or one person can get a baseball bat and another gets a super sledge. Make the weaker weapons in the class more viable so people just don’t instantly scrap or sell it.
---
The weapons are already in the game. The game would be so much more diverse and loot would be so much better to collect if they just did a proper weapon balance pass and reviewed some legendary effects and tweaked them. 80% of current legendary effects are useless as well as the entire weapon arsenal in the game, not to mention perk cards as well.
---
We’ve been needing a thorough balance pass for along time. But instead we get fallout 1st and the atom shop shitting down our throats.
---
Bringing back the Wattz 2000 from Fallout 1 would be cool, there's a mod for 4 called the Wattz 3000 which I recommend highly
---
The two shot fire rate plasma pistol could make a pretty good plasma thrower
---
A bloodied /aim hunting rifle with a perforating mag will kill a sheepsquatch or scorchbeast with one headshot crit.  The same bloody gauss with perforating capacitors will do even more damage.  I use a b/e lever gun, but the hunting rifle and gauss are more powerful with armor piercing mods.  It stacks on top of tank killer.
---
That being said, sniper builds haven’t gotten much in 76.  The Fixer is the big standout, but black powder weapons are not good for stealth.....at all.
---
Sounds like a great idea, but unfortunately they'd have to acquire music licenses, which wouldn't even be implemented in time for the holiday.
---
Like others said, vendor cap pool and legendary scrip pool reset 20 hours after first sale.
---
But if you mean challenges? Dailies reset at 10am EST, weeklies at 10am on Tuesdays (usually maintenance day). 
---
Atom shop rotates at noon EST, with weekly changes on Tuesdays
---
If you mean junk and stuff in the world? Those are based off total looted items. Containers and world items reset separately, after a certain number of relevant pickups (can't find the post with the specific numbers), with world items also having a static server condition, so if it's reset for you, but someone else takes it on that server, it wont be there. But if it's on cooldown for you, it could still be there for someone else.
---
Lol I like how you call it a thumper 😂. When I jump on later I'll compare your build to mine see if I can tweak a few things, for science. 😅
---
I’m not mad that people are doing anything. You’re mad that I won’t buy something that is extremely overpriced. I’ve seen fascnacht masks for 10k and it’s not even rare ones, that’s not a fair deal. You misinterpreted because you think I want a handout, when in reality I want a trade and not a steal
---
A few times for me, but I've always been able to log back in and keep going with the same world.
---
Primed Bloddy Handmade or Fixer with stinging mag( I prefer handmade for larger Mag.  Faster Firerate 25 less vats or 15 crit fill.  
---
All Commando Ranks
---
Nerd Rage
---
I like 3 in blocker due to all the small ground critters.
---
Bloody Mess
---
1+ in adrenaline
---
3 tank killer 
---
3 dodgy ( If you are better than me you can skip this to save AP for vats)
---
Adrenal reaction Mutation, Marsupial and speed demon, scally skin  are helpful as well
---
2 fireproof or dense chest
---
Lead lined backpak ,some rad resistant armor or dilute rad x
---
I prefer all unyielding Armor Sentenial RR and AP regen are nice attributes Assuming the fight is outside the nuke zone.  PA otherwise I like X-01 with emergency protocols.
---
The bloodied 50 is nice
---
The item is worth what is worth. If you want it cheaper look for someone to make a mistake and post the price wrong.
---
People also put prices extremely high to either show off items or because they are dumb. 
---
Dude I know yer cheap. Have fun searching. Peace.
---
Enjoy the downvotes! Next time, maybe look into something a little more instead of trying to be a prat. There were two vaults planned, the second one hasn't come. It's been over 4 months now.
---
I had the government drop follow me through the map, it's happened once before lol I went back to my place and it fell inside the house with fire going through the second floor. I was like I have a friend! keeps following me lol. The other issues discussed OP I would restart the game and it would get better.
---
I’d have 15 in agility as well. Tons of perks for a bloodied commando build in there. Plus, I feel like you are missing some damage perks to add to your weapon damage.
---
Waa. Waa. Waaaaaaa.
---
Maybe not damage, but vats perks maybe?
---
This isn’t skyrim dude. The price isn’t simply “the price.” People amp up prices to the extreme. The fireman suit is a common drop for a month old event. You don’t have to get your cathartic last word by calling me cheap
---
Sure it is. Value does not drop over time typically, only when more items flood the market. Pay what it’s worth or quit bitching.
---
yup, as long as you participate to some degree you should be rewarded
---
PvP bloodied isnt very good just giving you a heads up
---
Why’s that?
---
Thanks, I guess this is the latest bug.  Let me know if you try it again on something with visible damage numbers: so far, my hypothesis is that the client believes it is putting out op damage, but for some reason the server is not acknowledging.
---
trash event with trash rewards
---
I read "flatworms" eww
---
Quick synopsis. Auto Grenade Launcher, Grenade Launcher, and Fat Man are always scrip unless 1* bloodied. Nocturnal ruins anything it is on.
---
3s,12p,3e,6c,3i,14a,15L.
---
Why would you want to have any random mutation? Choose those that make sense for your build and buy them from a vending machine.
---
Personally would hope they would give us our own room in the vault. Would love to see the room designs people would make.
---
Nope, you may be thinking of faster reload.
---
Wiki: [Fallout 76 Legendary Effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
How about a junkies build? I know you get to keep full health but is there any perks I can use to negate negative effects
---
Maybe they meant "faster fire rate"
---
I’ll take all the pylons and provide trash removal on PC.  Alternately, I can take out the boss in 20-30 seconds if you need DPS.  I’ll server hop and repeat until you get the plan.  It’s mostly free scrip for me.
---
Good suggestion. I'd also like to see screen doors in the game.
---
uranium fever is a good event easy to do solo with the right perks and weapon its fairly easy if you pick up every single weapon/meat you got 2 choices to either scar all the weapons for steel or sell the meat and the guns to the vendor near the mine and make around 1000 caps just from 1 event ( make sure u have hard bargen maxed out) the glowing meat sells for 6 caps each but if u cook the food it sells for more but back on the point it would be nice if people can not kill the supervisor in 5 shots or 5 hits let other people have a hit and if that happend to you wel u may have lost a very good weapon so dont do it to other players please make the event 'playable' but if your going to be a dick just go buy a private server.
---
Vault 96 is still coming according to what was said at the QuakeCon panel, or at least there has been no announcement since then that it is being canceled. However, I think it is also not realistic to expect new content before Wastelanders now, everything has been delayed to Q1 2020, and until then the "legacy" version of the game is only receiving minor fixes and maybe a holiday event. It is not like complaining will change that, what is delayed is delayed, people need to be patient for the next months.
---
Junkies would be good. But I think just a plain commando build with a lot of defensive and high hp pool would be better. Maybe you can make that work into your junkies build but you can probably get max damage from an AAFFR handmade NO need to go broke over junkies ffr
---
my best was a bloodied +10 aim, faster movement lever action.
---
They also have mentioned that they are fixing bugs lol.
---
If they add screen doors then I demand they have 1 hp when anything attacks it except deathclaws where its immune to them.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if that were locked behind fallout 1st considering they did that with the tent.
---
I won't be happy until they release the unannounced, unneeded and totally unfathomable raid vault where we fight our way through millions of Gary clones to unlock a Gary clone power armor skin.
---
Seriously. People would rather risk their own rewards than let some afk guy get a free one. Who gives a fuck?
---
Not a rickroll. That highhat/clap was way too sharp, but it was a pretty solid remix
---
I wonder, at one point didn't they say they were adding displays for power armor and outfits but it got delayed due to technical problems.
---
You’re correct, That’s how it works, I have the plan but I’m extremely unlucky
---
Anything new for fallout 1st members?
---
But ratings go up to 10, If you want to give it more, rate it at 9 than come back and give it a 10.

I hate when ANY DEAD ENEMY DISAPPEARS BEFORE I CAN LOOT THEM!!! It happens all the time. Not to mention enemies ruining on their side going half way into the floor, there was this enemy that was alive but he was sliding in the floor at the speed of light but somehow he was alive. Also just recently, I was getting attacked a followed through the whole map by an invisible force UNTIL I FAST TRAVELED!!! 🙄🙄🙄 this game is ass in a lot of areas.

Advanced Ranger Armor paint
---
Downvoted cause of the stupid edit
---
So you'd rather let some butt chugger 1 shot the enemies so that only he gets a prize instead of changing the system and letting some afk guy who isn't effecting you get a couple free ones? SBQ is a different story cause get health scales, but that's the only one.

If you're on PC, I'd take that bloodied laser pistol off your hands. :)
---
Is free States solute any good? I already have raider solute. I would rather have free state but seems pointless to have two different solutes IMO.
---
I was really hoping for that data-mined Communist stuff, but I'm guessing that's now pushed back to mid-January. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
First of all those weapons are too modern for the time period, second making the assault rifle the AR15 makes no sense at all seeing how the AR15 isn’t an “assault rifle”
---
Add the Chinese stuff so enemies are more identifiable to drop
---
Probably unpopular but I would like to see the older model of Guass Rifle (either of its FO3, nv or creation club ( sorry I really loved the using the crank). With a scope and suppressor this could make a fun sniper.
---
Another week and no stackable power supplies or a floor design that I like. I am getting fing fed up with waiting for stuff to return. I have atoms and nothing that I want to buy.
---
You have to unlock the Scout Backpack in game before you can build the Atom versions. The Small Backpack form the Morgantown Airport doesnt count either.
---
I rarely see it dip below 60. It usually hovers around 90 or so with a 7700k and gtx 1080 at 1440p
---
Aha You hit like a Rad Roach!
---
Everything in the atom shop is a mod for the backpack, not the actual backpack. You need to do the pioneer scout quests to get the moddable backpack plan itself
---
Didn’t read it all but sounds like you haven’t done the tadpole challenge to unlock the backpack yet? 
---
Its in the middle north area of the map at the camp
---
There's a smaller beginner backpack plan in Morgantown Airport but as far as I know none of the atom skins apply to it
---
I average in the 120s, highs around 150 but lows in the 70-80s in places like Whitesprings. Been mucking with the damned graphics in this game more than any other before it and been playing on PC since the late 90s. Got quite a few settings lower than I'd like at the moment. 
---
Rig is going on 5 or so years. 6700k, 32gb ram, 1070x2 in SLI, ssd drives, 144hz gsync. Same rig will carry rb6 at around 200fps even during heavy firefights (though that may not necessarily be a fair comparison).
---
That said at least on PC we can adjust this stuff. Own it on PS4 &amp; rarely touch it as it is notably worse performance across the board.
---
Maybe the 250 Dr blocks some of the vamp effect. I watched a video of someone using a vamp mini and it looked like he was popping 2 stims.
---
Hey there! You purchased a skin for the backpack, not the actual backpack. The standard backpack must be earned through the (quite grindy) Tadpole badge challenges. You can then earn the mods for it by doing the (equally grindy) Possum challenges.
---
fuuuck nothing really new, or at least nothing excitingly new :-(
---
Preach!
---
That would suck but i do really want another chance at the Scabber Handmade skin.
---
*Outfit. Not paint
---
Another weight solution is excavator armor (+100 carry weight) Go to Charleston Fire Dept and read the poster to pick up the quest. It doesn't kick in till lvl 25 but you're almost there so you may as well start working your way in that direction.
---
That would be cool. Like the size of those from the Hobbit
---
Sounds like a commie. ;)
---
You know it's bad when they don't even bother with the atom shop.
---
Yeah, or even just porting and retexturing Frostbite Spiders from Skyrim.
---
There's a bunch of Chinese/liberator goodies on the way at SOME point. ATX leak from Nov 19th:

---
Given the big release of Free States stuff this week, with an amount of content matching the communist stuff above, we might finally get it next week? Otherwise it's getting a little close to christmas.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Yeah it’s the same thing dude, don’t trip
---
Yea I get a little annoyed when I'm trying to kill the legendaries that spawn during SB queen but I get held up on killing off shitty mobs while SBQ circles back around and barely get to the legendary before it's dropped. It would be nice if everyone contributes to the instance gets look like other mmos. I'm killing spawns and doing plenty of damage to SBQ but missing out of the legendary loot because I'm killing the wrong mobs. Kind of makes me want to not be a team player and only target legendaries and SBQ and let the mobs kill other guys.
---
Tnak you very much :)
---
I think introducing a whole new system is not a good idea considering we already have mutations. What's cool instead is if the current mutations made you become a ghoul or a supermutant based on what they do. But even then, it would take a high amount of work and resources to fit all the clothes for the supermutant version. This is most likely not a priority for them at all.
---
Yeah i don't care if people are afk to get loot - that's fine. What I don't like is a bunch of people who show up to an event that needs people to actually do something - then the event fails because they're all standing around and NO ONE gets loot. That's what frustrates me.
---
 Nice to see Bethesda cares so much about recycling that they start recycling their MTXs 💀💀
---
A Berserker player also doesn't necessarily have to be running around in their underwear.  You can wear armor, so long as you keep that armor broken.  Broken armor provides no protection, but any Legendary it has will apply.
---
Still, because the damage increase tops out at 50% - and because you'll die a lot - if you're going to do a low-health build, you're going to go Bloodied.
---
Did you get the V-tech stackable PS? It stacks and it's quiet AF. (Or is that what you're waiting for the return of?)
---
I don't mind them bringing past items back but its the frequency at which they do it. They hardly wait a month.
---
I actually like the Ranger Advanced.
---
Cool.
---
Yep, I wish people would realize this game.is not what they wanted and give up and move on.
---
I need some nasty floors.. scav theme.. cultist theme. something more wastelandy - less candy.

Heres a comparison between the Riot Armor and the original Ranger Armor
---
I mean literal gun manufacturers have been using that language to market military-style semi-autos to civilians throughout my entire lifetime. But if you wanna be a pedant about it and say the m16 is an assault rifle but the AR-15 isn't bc no select fire, sure? But the term approaches uselessness
---
washout is pure rng
---
Yikes!
---
You need to make sure that the switch sits between the generator and the door - and that the power has to pass thru the switch to make it to the door. I've done what you're trying to do in a previous CAMP - generator, conduit, switch, conduit, door. It can be done, you just need to make sure the wiring is sorted.
---
Yeah i mean between the two freestate ones.
---
Mine does decent with older rig and a rx480. I moved it over to HDD long time back and it's fine too. I think a lot of ram helps keep frames without jank. If you have a small amount of ram, I would imagine you need a ssd. Using a freesync monitor and ancient driver that came out before 76. The freesync works. I've optimized my oc though, overclocked to pete bootyhole speeds.
---
IMO, that's the best/most versatile one they've offered, which makes it all-the-more surprising that they Vaulted it.
---
I don't think I've ever seen the Green Backpack in the wild.
---
Best thing about console’s low frames is that they never change.
---
The game always looks worse at its base, but it never changes into the powerpoint at Whitesprings.
---
Pros and cons I suppose.
---
There are so many vaulted items I want to buy. I cancelled my subscription because who needs more atoms when everything is vaulted away. Bethesda loves trolling more than money.
---
Oh ok great thank you
---
Well Ill just keep my atoms for the next new bundle. The lack of new Atom Shop content is not a problem for me, as I think it means that everyone is working on Wastelanders and future updates.
---
i'm holding out for responders themed stuff or a small/invisible back pack but i feel like it aint gonna happen 😔
---
Dang just tried it with wall pass throughs it doesn’t work ☹️ I’ll keep trying though
---
Ffr does more damage. The explosive effect doesn't do anything against someone ready for PvP.
---
That could be a cool Vault Raid. Ending them where they all began, or a NPC town. I mean its any wastelander's dream to find a perfectly intact Vault, so having NPCs breaching in it is not unimaginable.
---
Yup, I agree - looks much better after the fix.  Having the bottom flapped open all the time, even while standing, looked wrong.
---
It was a relevant point within the argument.... what makes it stupid?
---
Yes I totally agree. I've got a 'crazy cat lady who runs a bar' build for my main, and a modernist cultist chapel with a secret vending dungeon on my alt, and the flooring is not fitting for either of those. I hate how the laminate gets a horrible glare to it and washes out the colour and makes everything super bright. We need scrappy clutter and wear-and-tear as well as the pristine stuff.
---
I think the best way wastelanders can bring that hope back is in the raider faction. They always approach every opportunity to kill with such enthusiasm that it is almost contagious.
---
Their hope to watch the world burn is the most likely scenario to find success in the post apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Cool! I ceetainly will
---
You on PC?  I used to be really good with the conduits and passthroughs, before I went on break from 76.
---
The 24th is a Tuesday so possible.
---
Finally Free States bundle is back though the 2 bundles i'm sure they were cheaper last time they appeared also have they kept items behind the bundle or is everything available separately this time round?
---
No sorry I’m on PS4 but thank you anyway
---
Has anybody got their monthly atoms? cus I still haven't
---
Instigating Explosive is pretty great on any rifle.  I’ve used it on the Lever and Handmade mostly myself, but it’s should be great on a fixer or combat rifle too.
---
Same I do like to visit Biv and collect some toxic waste on the side.
---
Yeah I was hopeful because of workshops - but the fact that building in them is pointless just takes the fun out of it for me. I know you can like save builds in the preset thing but it's not the same. 
---
I remember building at the tyler county dirt track on a new character- just trying some building ideas so i didnt have to scrap my camp - I had to have been like level 30 and a level 300+ just came and took it and destroyed all the buildings i had been making. Frustrating so I just don't bother with workshops anymore.
---
Use one of the floor mounted wire connectors and place it before you place the wall. That's what I did and it worked.
---
No, simply looking through the on doesn't work for me or friend I play with. It does show the enemies name so I know I'm targeting them, just no tag like the description says.
---
Condition doesn't affect stats any more. Having a weapon at 200% used to buff its damage. It's a shame really cause since the patch chainsaws, rippers and other weapons like that suck. 
---
The marine armor helmet is in the game files but currently unobtainable.
---
The IRS is and will always will be a faction you're forced to join. From a game design stand point I'm sure there is a reason but who knows for sure?
---
DM me to join my town or em. My discord. "Rebuilding"
---
You sure? I'm basing my info on Innov survivalist's video in which she tells it's ATX (she was the one to find it herself I believe, since she started datamining). Another thing that there are no Wastelanders outfits in the game files so far iirc
---
I can agree with this - I have often wished that ark and fallout could merge their building techniques in a way. I wish ark had a more streamlined menu like fallout and I wish fallout had more options because while fallout has the decorations - ark has all the building materials like greenhouse / stone etc. I would love to use greenhouse walls in fallout.
---
I get lucky, everyone so far (besides the occasional asshole) let's everyone else know when a legendary appears with the follow emote. Same here, I try my best to let peeps know.
---
I don't have too much issues with the uranium fever event. The SBqueen, I only recently got to hit her thanks to range and heavy guns, and no one with me drains her of health quickly so I can get some shots in.
---
I totally agree with this tho, random legendaries no, but actual scriped ones, you should be allowed to grab the items still.
---
Yeah i have black, But have Multiple Handmades (TSFFR, AAFFR, TSE, Furious 10%Damge Aiming) And would love to be able to tell them apart from just looking at them.
---
Had it happen once, can't hurt anything. It stopped after turned on the trap and repaired all.
---
We are still talking dollars the only difference is when we exchange currency. If I pay $90 for a game people who use dollars still understand that is expensive. There was a time when we only paid $60 for a new game but that price kept climbing now it's up to $90.
---
Likely going to drop on the 10th or 17th with the next patch. Atom store is barebones which usually happens pre-patch, and gives them a week or two to cycle xmas stuff in the store.
---
I'm sure alot of their planned new content was and is wrapped up in Wastelanders - its not as if they can pull that out without spoilers etc so they're probably humped.  
---
I'm sure we'll get some xmas stuff again though
---
On a handmade, it's much noticeably faster.
---
Some vault were accessible by glitching through the door. That's why I said that.
---
No
---
Free States stuff is back today my dude!
---
https://imgur.com/zBfCn5O
---
Bring back the R91, the best mod for fallout 4 was the R91 replacer for that hideous default assault rifle.
---
Yeah i missed that too :(
---
I'm not sold on the black skin for the handmade though - not sure why, it just looks too plain. Scabber one i definitely didn't like tho
---
You need to have focus on the enemy for like a second
---
i have a marine helmet but i want to keep it.  maybe u can sway me with the right cap offer. ps4
---
I use a low end gun to shoot legendaries, but at some times there are the people or a whole team grabbing the legendaries before i get a shot in. It is agravating since this is my favorite event but lately not so much.
---
I have to admit when this happens and i can kill a legendary quick,  I do, hoping to teach a lesson 🤷‍♀️ dont think it does tho.
---
Then there are the times the players call u over when a legendary shows and make sure people get their tags. Those times are the best, shows the community working together. Thank you.
---
I think they started separating the bundles now after the outcry during the Raider Bundle
---
1. It should work just by looking at things through them. You may need direct line of sight or be within a certain distance. There may also be a limit on how many targets it can tag at once.
---
2. No
---
3. It’s not in the game, it was taken from the dev room and duped on PC. 
---
4. All vendor sales are taxed at 10%. It’s supposed to help balance the economy but is utterly pointless. 
---
5. Zealots applies to anything with Scorched in the name, including scorchbeasts, as do prime receivers. 
---
6. I don’t think Orbital Strikes are affected by perks, but I could be wrong on this.
---
Holly molly! Atomshop?
---
Yeah that's something I loved as well. I recently started replaying Fallout 4 and I forgot how much time I could spend just cleaning up Sanctuary and decorating the homes. I do like building too but sometimes just decorating inside is fun for me. My friends on 76 always want me to decorate their camps &lt;3
---
1. only works on events (peepers) recon should mark and follow your target when you sight it.
---
2. no
---
3. i dont know
---
4. cos you just do
---
5. any scorched or scorched beast
---
6. dont think so, you dont launch the strike. but would need to try that. they all get wiped out anyway
---
1.) When using a recon scope or Peepers (special binoculars) it states in the description it can tag targets. I can not for life of me get this to work. 
---
2.) Everyone is giving conflicting answers, you got a source?
---
Yes sir! Seems the gods have smiled upon you today!
---
1. From the other comment it seems it might be buggy, but I've never used these effects so I don't know what to tell you.
---
2. It doesn't.
---
3. If you are talking about the Night Monkey-like one, I have no idea, if you're talking about the other one then it comes from the Dev Room and last time I checked it was not available on consoles yet.
---
4. Because reasons, I guess. Cap sink, because the mechanic is generally present in online games so the Devs thought it fit, or just because Todd wants your caps as well as your atoms and dollars or whatever is your real life currency.
---
5. It does, I hope, otherwise they'd be useless.
---
6.never used the things but I bet it does, they are called with granades after all. If the artillery worked I'd bet it worked on artillery explosions aa well, but I'd probably lose this one.
---
Proper town.... what a good chuckle... Can't build a single camp with couple turrets and a display case. 
---
Fucking town.... damn that is a good one.
---
It isn't supposed to work on player I guess. Or only if they're hostile and not hiding. Otherwise on npc, just aim and a symbol will appear above the target.
---
I'm with you. I scroll up and down those floor and wall decor lists every day, willing new things to appear there as if by magic! :-)
---
Those whole classes need sorting out and rebalancing tho. But with the new weapons adds to their energy categories and also Gauss then hopefully that rebalance is tied in with Wastelanders and we'll see it in the new year
---
I miss it too, looked way better before
---
Thank you so much for sharing! This is really great, I'm a returning player, and I wasn't confident to make my own build, but I think I can modify yours (taking out the bloodied bit) so I can do the story pve. Good luck finding your perfect weapon.
---
Well they did setup the triangle slave trade system.  So yeah the Dutch are pretty horrible...
---
Praise the Tod!
---
&gt; Out of the two proper sniper rifles we do have, the hunting rifle kind of sucks if it isn't Instigating leaving the Lever Action as the sole option for a high-powered long-distance rifle. 
---
Aren't you forgetting Gauss rifles?
---
So many atomic store items that were removed **months ago** just waiting to be returned and yet they bring back a fairly recent bundle. 10/10
---
The Christmas stuff is probably too integrated with the wastelanders update so we can expect it to come in Q1 2020 also.
---
Just tried it 🤷‍♂️I can’t seem to make it work. I’m going to do my best to describe the lay out of it all for you guys it is basically the main room that has all the outputs in it (by that I mean the thing you connect the pipe things too) is 2x4 that goes up by 1. On the left is the generator room which is 2x2 and to the right is my bedroom  which is 2x2 all the pass throughs lead in to the main room I’m just unsure how to connect them
---
Can confirm, got a Bloodied /+10% Aim Dmg Gauss Rifle. It's my baby and I won't trade it for anything in the world.
---
On the PC, it was smuggled out of the dev room and mass duped.  To my knowledge, that didn't happen on other platforms.  It has never been available "legitimately."
---
People still wear Power Armor? Lol
---
Only on PC. 
---
There was this bug that allowed players to go to the Dev room to take stuff and they took the helmet out and now it is circulating in PC.
---
Once you get one you can scrap it to learn the plan.
---
There is no language you need to worry about? What do you mean?
---
Right- we got marsupial- who needs stairs.
---
&gt;Hitting 1500 damage is required for loot
---
How'd you get that number?
---
You could always try to announce here as well to see if there's anyone up for doing the event with you to try to get people in the server before you start as well.
---
I had a 2 star legendary gulper do that to me yesterday...  He kind of did a funky death dance and then just disappeared. Luckily, I managed to grab the legandary weapon he dropped as he danced. Lost everything else but got the weapon. Measly 1 star but better than nothing lolol
---
Stop playing this stupid fucking game. My god its like you guys have Stockholm syndrome.
---
Looks insanely weird at the waist
---
Attached canned laughter to the throw up emote please.
---
There is a mod on fallout 4 that has giant spiders, but might be cool for a subterranean level.
---
A pie made out of Buffouts? You drug fiends are insane!
---
Definitely not enough to make it worth having as a 3rd affix especially with speed demon, the difference is negligible.
---
I helped kill the sbq yesterday and when I looted there was nothing on her.  Or it would "load" forever. .   Why does this happen?
---
Rebuilding would have still been the only option, because the resources in the Vault would still be finite. But having a safe space to return to and get parched up and eat and whatnot after a hard day of rebuilding, makes more sense than just throwing us to the wolves and hoping we survive to rebuild. The Wasteland still hasn't been rebuilt. At all. It will begin to be rebuilt with Wastelanders, in which case the people returning to Appalachia will be the ones rebuilding, not us. All we did was stop the Scorchbeasts, which no one knew about until we left the Vault. We stopped the Scorchbeasts instead of rebuilding, and according to Wastelanders, the Scorched and Scorchbeasts will still be around, so we didn't even actually stop them.
---
And what about Fallout 2? Everyone exited Vault 8, used their GECK, and started to rebuild immediately. Why didn't Vault 76 get a GECK?  Like I said, the narrative of Fallout 76 makes no sense. We're supposed to rebuild, but we're all actual people. We're not gonna rebuild. We're too busy "owning noobs." Clearly Bethesda is just going to tell us what happened, regardless if any players actually did that, and oh god that's such lazy storytelling.
---
I've had this happen to me before. 
---
I think you have to do a recent amount of damage to the SBQ in order to register that you tagged her. Could be wrong, though.
---
It would be cool to have bing singing white Christmas on the radio.
---
if you are not a pvp person but pve, weapon weight reduction properties on armors help a lot. I carry 21 Weapons.
---
I love the tip jar idea. Would be cool to tip at like camps you like!
---
That may be because my character styling was built out "larger" than the game default?
---
I like to just donate stuff in the Overseer's Stash for now.

This is what I personally use for my stealth bloody commando build. If you don't want to run stealth it could give you an idea of how to set up your build.
---
I also run full unyielding mostly wood pieces with a mix of harder to detect, poison resist, and ap. If you aren't going to run stealth you can try for heavy combat or scout armor for more dr, er, and rr.

its green in the icon buts its brown by default you can add paint to it currently theres a stupid bug with the model the shoulder pads look like american football player shoulder pads

I mean I gotta give u like at least 500c bc it’s the marsupial serum like pretty hard to get

I'd try the Whitesprings bunker. In the medical wing vendor

Fixer - TSE Faser AIM Move.
---
The fridge sale from 700 to 560 starts tomorrow.
---
The sale only saves 140 Atoms sadly.
---
ammo is insanely easy to make lol, if your looking on bodies thats why its hard   
---
Equip suoer duper, ammosmith, happy go lucky .. pop day tripper and charred scorchbeast liver and a alcohol product, then go to town crafting and enjoy all the super duper procs
---
Football players don't wear a tone of padding. It's not really a contact sport. Mainly kicking a ball xD

things still go bad in the fridge right just more slowly? if so no thnx.

I also did my first nuke solo. It was tough but it's the best feeling. Congrats, you look awesome!

Sorry, mean football in the US

Hello, we managed to beat washout on expert. In the process I managed to find 9 new code locations. Regarding Beta: 1.) In green house 1, on the shelf of the cabinet next to the door going into greenhouse 2. 2.) In green house 2 on a table underneath the breakable pipe. 3.) In greenhouse 2 on a table across from the breakable pipe. 4.) In greenhouse 3 on a silver box in front of a shelf next to the door leading to research. 5.) In research on a table next to a breakable pipe on the far right side behind a microscope. 6.) On a big black machine along the wall to the right of greenhouse 4. 7.) In pump room in the center of the bottom floor on the blue crate where the pile of crates are in front of chemical bank. Regarding Delta: 1.) on a silver barrel to the right of the breakable pipes on the bottom floor under Beta pump room. 2.) On the middle shelf on the bottom floor to the left of breakable pipes, next to the opening going into agriculture from the bottom floor.
---
I got mine last week.
---
You're a good player. We all thank you! 👍
---
I got mine, not sure when exactly.
---
4) inflation. Caps need to be taken out of economy or supply of caps will grow to the point where they are worthless. People already trade in alternate currencies so it’s a way of trying to stabilize the currency.
---
Yup, what Swendsen said - its everything else as well, so my aid vendor has my hardened mass, all bug parts , cooking oil and a few others that can scrap into junk for sale for 25k caps each
---
Which three 1* items did you get?
---
blue wallpaper
---
One of the blue wallpapers I believe.
---
I look forward to it!
---
Would be cool. +1 on the idea.
---
Yea I wasted 500 atoms on that backpack, not knowing that its small as hell and sits at an awkward position on your back. I put it on one time and never equipped it again.
---
Well not mass duped per say - Scrapping one unlocks the ability for you to build it yourself. So likely a few got traded/sold then those people scrapped it built their own started selling/trading etc until its spread out.
---
I was bummed out, too, but just for a moment until I remembered Bethesda doesn't deserve our money.
---
It also boosted armors stats early on.
---
Interior walls... that we can add wallpaper do both sides !! And yes ceiling textures as well !!
---
Ohhh shit 😬 i made post about it 
---
Everyone got theirs instantly. Ive done it 30x so far and still haven’t got it keeping one friendly alive you’re first person to say they got it after so many. I’m over here thinking i did something wrong it’s basically like getting radium rifle this event.
---
Hey Beth, why don't you sell me some of those armor paints from the various leaks.
---
Sure, found a tweet with some pics

---
I don't do PVP, but I believe the damage cap is 110, so anything more than that is a waste. Also, having low health is not good for obvious reasons.
---
The "faster fire rate" legendary effect is ideal. Avoid "250 damage resistance while reloading" because it's bugged. Quad might be the best primary effect for PVP, but I'm not sure.
---
Yup! And T-60. Modus for X-01.
---
I definitely like that the Thanksgiving Case is ‘open’ for better viewing...hopefully in the future they add a more modern mid-century looking ‘open’ shelf.
---
Looking at your original post with your revised build, it looks like you're leaning toward the Heavy Weapon/Power Armor combo. I designed a Full Health Heavy/Power Armor build that is as tanky as possible while also being able to dish out damage. I also included the mutations that you'd want to include in the build design below. This design is similar to a Bloodied Heavy/Power Armor tank build that I made for two of my friends, and they both reported that they were very difficult to kill in PvP, despite having Bloodied builds.
---
You'll want to have Sentinel Assassin armor if you ever take off your Power Armor. Any BOS Shielded Under Armor would also be ideal. For the Power Armor itself, I'd recommend the Sensor Array mod for the Helmet, Emergency Protocols for the Torso (this makes you SUPER tanky - I almost never have to stim when fighting the SBQ with my BLOODIED build because of this mod!), and Kinetic Servos for the Legs (Kinetic Servos make it so that your AP refresh speed when moving is as fast as it would be if you were standing still - you want AP refresh for Dodgy). If you need more carry weight, you can use Calibrated Shocks for the legs rather than Kinetic Servos. T-51B or X-01 Power Armor would be my recommendation.
---
For weapons, Junkie, Anti-Armor, or Vampire prefixes would be good. I use a Vampire's Explosive Submachine Gun with my Bloodied build to tank events like AWOL or Encryptid.

---
What a surprise, right?
---
It's a legit number it's been said by dataminers
---
My friend told me all you need is to complete it with the secondary object of the terminal and the other robot taking over. He got it straight away.
---
Use the T-51b instead of the Ultracite. Better Damage and Energy resistances with a lower repair cost. You lose some radiation resistance, but you can easily compensate for that in a variety of ways.
---
or they are focusing more people and time on Wastelanders instead of new shit for the atomic shop
---
Are you talking about the game bar on Win 10? Activated/deactivated with winkey + G.
---
Is there an end date for the Advanced Ranger?
---
Want to get all the Ranger/Riot/Desert options but wondering if i can wait a bit and maybe get two releases for a single months sub.
---
A really simple one that got me was one from a guy who had been locked in a fridge. He's just screaming begging to be let out and nearby you find his skeleton in a fridge. When you really start to think about it it's like "Damn, I don't want to die trapped in a fridge either. That'd be really horrifying."... Simple, but effective
---
Agreed....I purposely avoid interior walls because otherwise it completely messes up the look.
---
My nocturnal rolling pin says otherwise....
---
Then you need to deal more dmg to her.
---
Yea, I believe "overall looks goofy as shit" sums it up perfectly, well played OP
---
They look like Destiny Titan shoulders
---
I also think there is a good chunk of people who don't know the tag rule. I didn't till around level 200 cause I never teamed up with anyone or even thought about it. Thought the legendary loot sharing was only for the sbq.
---
Wouldn’t someone just kill a few random easy enemies to get the credit of clearing a event, then jumping in to loot all the legendaries?
---
Why can't we have some Enclave stuff? It's a mat black or dark grey skin with a logo! It's not that hard!
---
PLEASE! Ceilings and double-sided interior walls are essential!
---
There is not currently a Buffout crafting recipe available. It doesn’t even show up as a greyed our option in the Chem Station list. 
---
**However, if you craft any derivative, it will count.**
---
So, for example, if you craft Bufftats, it counts for the Buffout and Mentat challenges. 
---
*Unless they changed something recently. This is how it worked last time I did this daily.*
---
Be sure to equip Chemist &amp; Super Duper, of course.
---
The irony is that my turrets will shoot up my CAMP but won't even react when a griefer kills my Brahmin or opens up on me and gets a "WANTED" tag.
---
Guessing Atom Shop?
---
PC? I’m online now and would be glad to help
---
Cross play would be OK I guess, but as a PC player I'm not sure I could stand all the kids and cheaters that proliferate on the console platforms, never happen anyway due to licencing and $$$
---
Nah, I'm good. Had enough of them while playing Conan Exiles.
---
You can do the event solo! It's difficult, but I've done it. The Cola Nut perk combined with a stockpile of Nuka Grape or Nuka Quantum and perks like Serendipity, Dodgy, Fireproof, and Blocker really help.
---
Sentinel, Troubleshooter, or Troubleshooter Sentinel armor are great to have. Get a Dense torso mod. Otherwise, you can use Power Armor with Emergency Protocols for the torso mod.
---
Man, I don't even know that the "game bar" is.  All I know is that an overlay display with at least 6 separate components marked "XBox this and that" suddenly popped on my screen and made it nearly impossible to continue playing until I went to each one and turned it off.
---
So good, loved the Kent Conley references.
---
I always saw the head mistress as a batman character with all of her female Robins
---
Awesome idea.
---
Time to say good bye to 40+ mini nukes. Let them be someone else's problem now.
---
If you play with a mic, GT: DownwindCloud73
---
Wasn't fashnat a exclusive event I don't believe it will return once wastlanders is out I'd expect a different seasonal event
---
Yes was thinking that today as I was looking up at my butt ugly ceiling.
---
Same! I always make quaint little buildings in 76 that are mostly decoration-driven. Usually only 5 by 5 and 2 floors. I basically make Ranch homes, or double wide trailers. The other thing I really like doing is making a town out of small buildings as well. Ill have a garage that's just for work benches, a small house just to hang out in and then maybe a shack for my vending machines!
---
i didnt think about the label and i keep all the holos and notes i find
---
yes they should
---
Nah the mannequin would act as the chassis and there is no reason why they couldn't nerf the weight when applied to the mannequin simply because they do that anyway with the chassis anyway 0.1 just for display purposes
---
You have the Marine **Combat** Helmet on PS4?
---
I'm curious about what you mean.
---
A friend of mine on Xbox recently had a companion command option appear in Nuclear Winter when facing a teammate, which appears to be an early version of the method to interact with companions when Wastelanders comes out.
---
i forgot to mention i have the bowl can you display the nuka tapper
---
yes
---
In the atom Shop they have:
---
(a) 'discounted' items the day they were released creating these impression of a sale [illegal in many countries]
---
(b) introduced paid utility items despite advertising they would not do so [illegal in my country]
---
If they breached the Act, it's not hyperbole to argue this represents a pattern of behaviour which moves it from misdemeanor to felony. (n.b. I said probably when mentioning the change in advertising was due to blowback)
---
I cannot express in words my anger and frustration at the way this game has been monetized. I have 0% trust that anything BGS says they will stick to, or won't change if they think it can make them a buck. That is not an opinion formed in the void. Adding the things up, the canvas bag, the ACCC refunds, like I said it's a pattern. In isolation, not a felony, in context, a bored QC and a judge looking to make an example could give them trouble.
---
Even if it's not a felony breach, it's still a breach. Saying I've never been convicted of a felony is quite a qualifying statement
---
xbox
---
got it
---
They just bug out sometimes. I don't know of a fix either. 😖
---
oh sorry.  i have the combat armor helmet
---
I've seen some of the little small towns people have made of their camps before - I really like that idea - I wish we could do more with it
---
So if I’m reading this correctly you have both the power and the switch connected to different ends of the same pass-through wall conduit. 
---
The pass through conduit behaves the same as the rest of the conduits. Power flows in through one of the 3 connection points and out the other 2. If you are running power from another conduit line then the switch needs to be put in before the pass-through. 
---
There are some great tutorials for FO4 conduit building on YouTube. All of the conduit building in 76 was copy/pasted from 4 so it is easy to understand. Once you get to know how all of the pieces work it becomes pretty easy to set up conduits and avoid ugly wiring in your camp.
---
The vendor tax is easy! It's actually a brilliant Bethesda plan. Your taxes are used to fix the potholes all over places like the Cranberry Bog and \*falls into Scorchbeast Fissure\*
---
If I remember correctly they were going to push it at the time Morgantown Nuclear Winter came around but it got pushed back or they said they were still working on it. I assume it's gonna come in Wastelanders since they seem to be pushing everything back to Wastelanders while dealing with minor bugs rn.
---
Only if I can ride one.
---
I'm in a group of veteran dataminers and none of us have ever been able to pinpoint the exact number, but in-game testing shows it to be around 400.
---
If they impliment this theres no way to stop AFK..thatd just become the new issue. But itd still be better. Only issue is now youd have a-holes spawning on events, making them harder and then not even helping. Still technically better then kill-hogs though. I'd rather deal with AFK's then kill-hogs
---
This question is bugged. It has no answer.
---
I think they copied this https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/M-113_creature?file=M-113_creature.jpg
---
It just depends what side of the argument you fall on. I don't think someone can argue against the points you made. However, they should've never promised that all atom shop purchases would be strictly cosmetic. I think this is the reason some people are mad. It's like how COD delayed the implementation of the battle pass until months after launch in order to have the initial launch go more smoothly.
---
Happend to me with one violent night the other day
---
Agreed. One of the very few stories that had depth and emotion.
---
Starched Gene's is a definite must. Rad sponge an ghoulish in a group for a nuke zone. I love good doggie but dont need it that much with my carnivore. Ammo smith and super duper are essential secondary perks. Serendipity has saved my life a few times
---
I was hoping Fallout 1st was gonna be like Conan Exiles where you paid for a server that was constantly open and you and your friends could build as much as you want. Idk why private servers cant allow you to build alot more. Or if the devs at Bethesda just didn't feel like messing with build space for private servers.
---
Not looking for a level in particular
---
Must have perks, not build specific.
---
Class Freak
---
Tenderizer
---
Gunsmith
---
Armorer
---
Fireproof
---
Scrapper
---
Super Duper
---
AmmoSmith
---
Green Thumb
---
Not all of these are equipped all the time.
---
Well . . . since I was getting the living shit shot out of me when it happened, I didn't pay too much attention the details.  The effect was to pop up a series of separate, rectangular areas with what looked like control "buttons" on top of my game screen.  And the kill "X" for each one was bloody hard to locate.
---
Green Thumb and Butcher's Bounty (rank 1).  Makes fetch quests quick and I never run out of food.  I just leave them on unless I'm SBQ pops up or someone actually wants to raid.
---
In the same position ( that photo was from a friend ) - The paint seemed to have an end date, but it looks like the regular Ranger is still available. So you should be safe to wait until at least the 2nd paint comes out.
---
lad
---
I miss the curved floors and curved concrete walls.
---
You lost.
---
You mean that fabricated war to generate clickbaits? People stopped being clickbaited.
---
So the pass thrus are shaped like a C - with the connector on the back of the C and open connections on the top and bottom of the C. You need to add either conduit (to extend the reach) or the connector ends to the top and bottom of the C. Then you run wires from there to your device.
---
So in my case, I had the pointy bit in the middle go outside the shack walls, with wires running to the door on one side and generator on the other. Then I put the connectors on the tops of the Cs and then ran wires from those to the switch.

You keep the lights on sure. If they didnt fucked up they didnt even have to make a sub option. They are extremely lazy with their updates, fixes etc. Some of the bugs are so easy to fix actualy that there were people writing guides in hope that bethesda just copy paste it. Nobody is telling you not to pay for 1st. But knowing their system, they will soon make this game pay to win becouse their statistics say that people like to pay for extra stuff. Private servers should be for everybody.. same with the tent it was an idea that this community gave them. Same with collectrons and fridge. They are lazy and they are making this game worse day by day by nerfing legendary spaws etc. They create a problem and sell you the solution, you can support this but think about it. This is not long term solution. And if you think that wastelanders will save this game, think about those screenshots. There are modders who can create new weapons even sets, new quests, new locations and this studio shows you few screenshots of already existing locations. Its not like they have to model everything new. You can clearly see from screens they are just using fo4 models. This is fucking lazy and i dont understand how can anyone pay for f1st when they paid 60$ for this broken game without any endgame.
---
The channel name is Falloutboy420
---
They said that they plan to bring Fasnacht back, and they even put in the lore (notes you can find throughout helvitia) that the robots were basically programmed to do Fasnacht parades whenever they felt like it for tourism reasons, so it can really come back whnever bethesda wants.
---
Would love it if they actually did it again, though. Instead we got Meat Week like three times.
---
I’m going to try that i have the code completed it before i wonder if I actually have to do it like figure out how to get code on my own.
---
So now neckbeards posting salt is a war?
---
exactly, never existed
---
It doesn't have any effect on private server sessions.
---
And that's where everyone should just sit back and watch as the a--hole gets creamed...
---
Your first paragraph is in reference to something that happened 12 months ago... it has absolutely nothing to do with fallout 1st (the thing you are saying was somehow feloniously advertised).  Stick to the discussion at hand. 
---
You should really talk to someone if you are this angry over a video game. It’s not healthy to get this worked up. I don’t want you to have a stroke so I’m just going to let this be. Feel free to yell some more into the void. After that I hope you speak to a qualified professional. I am being sincere.
---
I spent $17 to buy the game originally and subbed for 1 month of first.  It was totally worth it.  I loaded up on resources for a month and got the cool outfit and some atom store stuff.
---
I'll probably resub when we get some new content, but for now I would say doing the 1 month sub was completely worth it.
---
Aquagirl/boy is mine. The rads you take from water is ridiculous.
---
there are people who are running around these events specifically doing this too so they can pick fights with people after the event ends.  best bet is to just hide in a spot that one legendary might spawn and get your shot in asap or just leave the event sadly
---
The main storyline in Fallout 76 contains a lot of hope. Unfortunately, the Scorched Plague stopped all of the major factions literally days or weeks before they solved Appalachia's problems permanently.
---
The Free States, who had been ostracized prior to the Great War, emerged from their bunkers and helped to rebuild Harpers Ferry, which housed some of the Free States' greatest pre-war critics. Together, they set up a viable, well-protected community and found a way to track, trap, and kill Scorchbeasts. They started working with the Brotherhood of Steel toward the end to address the Scorchbeast threat. They were also working with the Responders to set up trade routes.
---
The Responders were doing everything they could to fight the Scorched threat, rescue and rehabilitate survivors, and they managed to find a cure to the Scorched Plague just before the end.
---
The Brotherhood was standoffish, but they took it upon themselves to protect Appalachia from the greatest threat of all: the Scorchbeasts. They pursued not only pushing the Scorchbeasts back, but eliminating the source: the Scorchbeast Queen. They also worked to secure dangerous technology in the area to prevent another apocalyptic event. They had nearly succeeded just before the end.
---
Vault-Tec equipped the residents of Vault 76 and Vault 94 with the vast resources needed to rebuild post-War Appalachia. Though Vault 94 was one of the societal experimentation vaults, it actually was equipped for this purpose and was relatively free from disastrous Vault-Tec interference.
---
The Enclave and the Raiders were the major factions that stood in the way. The Enclave more or less killed itself off, while the Raiders doomed themselves by preventing the other factions from completing their important work to defeated the Scorched and Scorchbeasts.
---
I say run heavy junkies. I run heavy/exploding junkies and my Gatling, .50 HMG, and LMG rip everything to shreds.

So it would work like the camps in Rust work?

Anti fo1st were vanquished.

Gimme that 70’s popcorn ceiling look!
---
Give me some damn shingles for my roof Bethesda!!
---
Put them in your vendor for 25k.
---
They will be safe in there as nobody will buy them at that price 👍🏻
---
Borderlands isn't trying to wedge online play into the Creation Engine which was designed for solo play
---
No, in that regard you can craft psycho buff and get a buff out and a psycho credit.
---
Absolutely.
---
Thats a fair point. But here we are.
---
If your running a sneak build Vats and Agility.
---
If your not, then Vats and Agility
---
Basically Vats and Agility.  
---
Limb damage doesnt do more damage to limbs, it does increased condition damage for cripples.
---
50% limb damage is better for doing 50% extra limb damage and +33% VATS gives you an extra 33% VATS accuracy
---
Most of the Jimmies cried themselves out, now just usually wait for Tuesdays to post about how the update completely broke the game, sometimes they jump ahead to Mondays to freak out on updates.
---
Thank you. I actually thought the +50% limb damage was "damage." It makes sense now.
---
Appreciate the update post.
---
I don’t mind old ones as much because I hope for the second raider bundle to roll back around so I can grab it.  Otherwise I want a big fat Scrooge McDuck style pile of atoms in preparation for new content.
---
My hope is that all hands are working on Wastelander polish.  This update without a doubt will be make or break for this game, so if that is why the atom shop has been lame as of late, I’m begrudgingly ok with that.
---
Ah yes i forgot it was from the shop
---
yeah i should have thought of that, guess i wasn’t noticing the missing items as i kept adding more.
---
That Fallout 1st reskin of the Ranger outfit, AGAIN, is Jagex levels of lazy.
---
for some reason this doesn’t happened to only my HM. weird
---
Limb damage can be helpful for tanky enemies like the Alpha creatures in Project Paradise or the SBQ. For everything else, you’ll see a bigger benefit from VATS &amp; AGI. Not a bad idea to stash the limb damage one away, but I’d carry the other one.
---
In a pattern of behaviour, the temporality is irrelevant.
---
It'll go to court in a month and I'm very certain it will be upheld given the language of the law.
---
I spent $500+ on microtransactions to keep this game alive then realised it was under false pretense. You'd be angry as well
---
Fair enough my mistake I do hope they switch up the rewards and keep the masks as "season 1" items and rare  I like games where I'm rewarded for my time with something cool and limited
---
Yes! If we have pristine floors and walls then it stands to reason there should be a cleaner looking ceiling to finish the look. It makes no sense that someone would settle for a battered roof in a freshly papered and carpeted room. (That people have freshly papered and carpeted rooms in the post apocalyptic future also makes no sense, but hey!) I would also like more beds (not kiddy / comic book ones) with duvets and pillows on them and not just those skanky mattresses from Fallout 4. If my character is savvy enough start a microbrewery then I'm pretty sure she could muster up a blanket! When your walls and windows are full of holes, nobody is sleeping without a duvet. Rant / plea over!
---
Might be a dumb question but did you act as a pilon?
---
Okay that actually makes sense on how that would work.
---
This event  started on the server i was on last night,literally at the same time as a Nuke was launched.
---
I went to the Nuke.
---
I’ve had this happen here and there, but not specifically with this event. It last happened this weekend in the Charleston capitol building. Same thing, danger indicator and kept taking damage, and there were ghouls around. I never was able to escape the source for more than a few seconds, so I server hopped.
---
This has not been my experience at all. The SSD improvement was major across the board, tested on both my original Xbox One and my new Xbox One X - if this had been a server issue, I would occasionally see these results without the SSD. That is not the case. Here are a few examples:
---
* Getting from a fresh start of Fallout 76 to an Adventure server no longer takes 2-4 minutes. I can fresh start Fallout 76, get to the main menu, and fully load into an Adventure server in 30-60 seconds.
---
* Fast travel is almost instant. A friend could start fast traveling several seconds before me. I will arrive several seconds before he does.
---
* Instead of taking 10-20 seconds to load a complex CAMP, it takes about 2-3.
---
* Lag in Nuclear Winter is significantly reduced - a loading stutter that used to last 2-3 seconds is now a fraction of a second.
---
* Load times in NW are significantly reduced - I can load into a server and loot 1-2 nearby crates before most people can even move. Connection speed is also a factor here. If someone is on WiFi and a standard hard drive, I will typically load in 3-5 seconds faster.
---
Might just be the buildings and such that you have at your camp. There are some things (turrers, brahmin feeder) that take a larger amount of the budget. In all honesty turrets do very little to no good so I don't bother with them
---
For a month I guess
---
If someone shoots me with a 50 cal or an Ultracite Laser Rifle, even with the SSD, my game will freeze. By the time the lag spike has passed, I'm already dead.
---

---
Here's a list compiled by some about the rewards. It is still unclear right now how the festivities will work.
---
I decided to take out all my turrets, nothing really ever attacks.  I also don't use crops either, they take up quite more than I thought.  Also the steel bungalow has a higher budget hit than the garden dome, which annoyed me during a shop rebuild.
---
Cannibal can be useful if you don’t want to worry about carrying food around. Just nom nom nom away. You can’t be wearing PA to use it though.
---
it's just a bad ending for a fairly nice quest. idk why Bethesda tries soooo hard and f things up sooo badly. It bogles my mind. I think the Imposter sheepsquach assaultron is the toughest enemy. I literally ignored that quest until I just stumbled upon it. there were like 8 players, constantly dying, rezzing, and then give dying, respawning and shooting the damn thing. with bunch of lvl52 Mr gutsies and other robots, it's a total mess, total chaos. I hate it in almost all fallout games but especially super duper annoying and Boring in 76.
---
Thanks, I figured it was probably a data mine and not an actual announcement
---
Colt AR 15 is the non-military version of the M-16, or C-7 in Canada. It is an assault rifle. If not wtf is it?
---
The struggle is real and constant. :'( Do you use a lot of turrets and crops? They use a lot of budget. As do brahmin and those massive light-up signs on legs (not the technical description but I'm sure you get what I mean!) I go without those things in order to spend more on decorating and lighting. And it still isn't enough budget.
---
Lol, i agree... but bugthesda doesn't care.
---
Some gamers use them far too often.
---
You can get 6,7, Gamers running around Shooting  SBQ in the Sky over V89,and another 4 gamers running around jumping up,and down with Thumbs down Emojis because they disagree.
---
Same at Uranium Fever.
---
The Self appointed Game Police.
---
I am Canadian, America invaded my homeland according to Canon. Reason enough eh COMRADE?
---
We can help you with that COMRADE
---
u/gilpo1 looked through the files and didn't find any quest node, so we have info about the rewards, but nothing about a "quest" or "event" of sorts.
---
Funny how Fallout isnt stable without community-contributed patches, almost as though the people who have been playing the game for 10+ years have some solid ideas about the way it should perform.
---
Yeah, so basically there are 3 ranger armors with slight variations. Ranger, Ranger Advanced ( which came out today ) and then Ranger Elite ( probably January )  and then skins for each.  Riot Skin and Desert Camo Skin.
---
OP, I was just wondering about that myself.  I'm guessing once people realized it didn't affect them one way or the other they just moved on.
---
Lead belly, starched genes, class freak, white knight, inspirational, strange in numbers, squad maneuvers, hard bargain, super duper. Just to name a few
---
depends on your goal.  Resource, vending, view, ease of access, safety....  
---
If you:
---
want foot traffic for vending machines, near popular area(s)
---
don't want to constantly be damaged by high level creatures, the west of the divide
---
want an unobstructed view, any cliffs on either side of the divide. 
---
don't want low level critters attack inside, make it floating
---
want easy access, somewhere around the center of the map.
---
don't want to be bothered, extreme N, S, or E edge of the map, or high on Seneca Rocks
---
don't want to be nuked, most of the west side, or away from populated areas of the mire, bog, or ash heap.  
---
want a specific resource, then find a node that fits within the desired location parameters.
---
Depends what sort of life you lead as a wastelander I guess.  Wilson's autos is a great spot that allows you to build inside the existing building.  Saves on budget as it already has a PA station an armorers. Another, if you want a pet dog, is just east of Harper's ferry on the high rocks above the traintracks. Secluded, you never get attacked, and great areas roundabout for looting.
---
I was so bummed when I found out I can only built at shitty open middle of nowhere places. we should DEFINITELY be able to build on top of any structure, and right next to them, with the exception of building enterances.
---
Seems like they are on cruise control until next year, which honestly is surprising to me. How many resources would it actually take to hire a team to ensure new cosmetics are constantly flowing into the game, either through the paid shop, NW or (be still my heart) in-game rewards? Considering the Atom Store and First subs are how they make their money, you'd think they'd make it a priority.
---
Too modern? PPsH, MP 40 and Browning are WW2! FN SLR is 50's, AR 15 is 60s etc. Got to admit my plasma rifle is too modern though.
---
you wouldn't be hearing of people who just up and left because of Fo1st, now would you?
---
the servers and even this sub got a lot deader since the announcement. only suckers who support 1st and suckers who still play this mess regardless, like me, remain.
---
I know I said I wouldn’t respond but I just went through your posts and you seem very disingenuous. [you said you quit over 2 months ago. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/d59hjy/fallout_76_has_gotten_better_but_the_atom_shop_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  and then here you are trading and posting about recent vault raids. Let me know how your court case goes. Be sure to tell them about how you still regularly play the game that you feel has stolen so much from you.
---
Yep it's exactly that, you have to reach a minimum damaged threshold before you get any loot from her
---
Really not sure why they haven't done this yet. They reused enough stuff from Fallout 4, may as well do this as well.
---
I am modest. Give me the big barn door and i'm a happy dweller.
---
They announced a Christmas event. They did not announce rewards.
---
I can't believe I forgot serendipity, yes it is outstanding
---
Completely agree so long as you’ve been there long enough to help.

Honestly, if you can just get a bloodied anything, even if it's a 1*, you'll see better damage than TSE whatever else. I have bloodied rad rifle, pipe rifle, combat rifles all three star, but I'm almost always using my 1* bloodied handmade.
---
You should still be getting some extra damage from nerd rage and adrenal reaction, but definitely look for a bloodied weapon at player vendors, it's much better damage to sho
---
Blocker. Essential for any build, I'd say. 45% less damage from melee attacks is a no-brainer for me. Especially important if you are a melee build who needs to get all up in the face of melee enemies!
---
A semi-automatic rifle isn’t an “assault rifle”. Is it fully automatic? Select fire? Nope.
---
I, too, have 1st. I intended only to get it for a month, but my renewal date is fast approaching and I will definitely be renewing, even if they don't add more "stuff". Atoms are ok, the tent is a cap saver, and the scrap box is great. The outfits are neat, but the private server. Man. The private server. I only go into adventure to vendor hop.
---
76 falls into a weird space in the gaming landscape. It's a persistent online game (an MMO, without a huge playerbase), and yet it doesn't charge a subscription to play. It's not charging for new content, yet promises periodic updates. It has all of the maintenance and development costs of something like WoW, without the influx of expansion and subscription funds.
---
WoW charges you for the game, charges you per month (after a certain point I understand), and charges for each expansion.
---
FO76 is not charging a subscription, it's not charging for DLC, and you can get the base game at a deeply discounted rate. Where exactly is the money to keep the lights on coming from? Atom shops sales clearly weren't doing it, cosmetic or not. 1st seems to have at least bought some breathing room. If people don't want to subscribe to 1st, then great - they don't need to. If they don't want to buy atoms, great - they don't need to!
---
But if no one buys atoms and no one buys 1st, how is this game supposed to even stay online? Let alone develop? 
---
An honest, no flaming question - how is Bethesda supposed to maintain servers, patch the game, and create new content on an ongoing basis with only the initial $60 (or less) someone paid a year ago?
---
This is the saddest Atomic shop update yet.
---
Fucking bullshit.. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
Well thank you so much :)
---
Thank you! Will look into it!
---
Yeah I said S O M E, not all. The weapons won’t be added, and if they are, they’ll be some knockoff version. The plasma rifle looks like it’s straight out of some 40s cartoon, it’s nowhere near modern lmao. Maybe retro-futuristic
---
New? This looks a few months old
---
And BoS stuff.
---
I really think these guys at the studio in Texas have a super hard on for the free states, and it needs to stop.
---
  I gained a little bit of budget by using the T-giving display cases.  They hold 6 items instead of 4 and are half the physical size of the big glass cases...so you need fewer of them to display the same amount of stuff, they take up less space.  Since they are smaller, you may be able to reduce the size of your floor/foundation.
---
  If you have lots of electric lights, try changing them for the oil lamp type streetlights.  Eliminates a bit of wiring/connectors.
---
I can MAKE the 5.56, but I’m not sure if I have enough to create all of that. But, is there any other ammo you want? 5.56 is what I mainly use, but I have MORE then enough of every other type
---
You'd figure since quite a few people are giving them money theh would actually put out something worth it. Sure, they look cool, but in the long run it really does look like a joke. They could have bundled the Ranger outfits up and offered something new each month. 
---
But as I said, this is Jagex levels of lazy. They put a free outfit out and when their premier members were mad that they didn't put out another outfit, they just recolored it and pit it out for their premier club. Lazy.
---
Gimme Christmas or Brotherhood stuff. Or give me actual camp decorating stuff.  We could really use more wall decor that's not themed, or more mid century modern type of furniture, art deco themed stuff. Even another of the nice art pieces or two. New roofs, ceiling texture. 
---
I'm a decent level and have done pretty much everything I can in the game. The only thing keeping me around is Nuclear Winter and camp building, so I'm a bit passionate about camp stuff.
---
Negative, emotes need to be less intrusive, not moreso.
---
Canned laughter would instantly kill this game for me. It is Fallout, not Seinfeld.
---
Yeah, quest markers have been bugged for a while now. Same goes for the marker you can manually place on the map. Sometimes they appear, sometimes they don't. It's a huge drag.
---
Every one of my characters full-times:
---
Blocker (-45% melee damage)
---
Fireproof (-45% explosive damage)
---
Lone Wanderer (-20% damage when alone)
---
Starched Genes (Keep mutations)
---
Bloody Mess (+15% damage)
---
Something like this would be exciting (to me) and keep me busy for a good while tbh.
---
It's "ba dum tss"
---
Source: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ba%20dum%20tss
---
I'm pretty sure that's been the standard for years now.
---
I felt the same way you did before Fallout 1st came out. I was excited to support the developers, bought the Bundles that came out and a few atom points here and there. The thought was - "The money I'm spending is going to the Development team that's fixing the game!"
---
Where are we now? How much of a better state is the game in after all the money (we) spent went to support the developers? Did Bethesda hire extra dev teams to help iron out bugs? No. Most of that money is lining the pockets of some suit at Zenimax and they spent the rest on development for the Atom Shop, so they can charge us for fridges, scrap bots, and infinite scrap storage.
---
is the loot free for all, so only 1 buy can snatch it all up anyway? All i seen is lots of empty corpses.
---
I think it's pretty good. But I'm disappointed that a group of badass femme fatales all die because some selfish girl has mommy issues.
---
Bloody mess, starched Gene's, and lead belly
---
More damage permanent mutations and no food rads
---
I see what you're saying but it adds a unique element to the class that defines it. I don't want all rifles to be teh same and the only thing you're picking is the look and whether it is ballistic, laser etc.
---
That give and take of the class \[high power shot with a charge duration\] is what makes it. Lasers, is fast fire rate, recoil and high break rate etc.  
---
I think that adds to the variety of the game, you get something and you have something to deal with that adds character.
---
So yeah for the crank-gauss sure bring it in - it'll have massive damage for one shot, perhaps be the ultimate sniper, but it'll be total arse if you're detected or mobbed. But i like the variety and also the challenge of having something like that added to the game
---
Had my first private server crash today since 1st day. So compared to normal adventure mode it's nothing i'd say.
---
There is a very persistent fire effect that sticks around for a while, produced whenever the Imposter fires the laser.  If you fast travel to the event while it is in progress, the visuals don't always sync up correctly.
---
I imagine I’m farting the robot song
---
Mounted gorilla head?   (row 76)
---
pls, i need some rusty floors and not wood or stone! do they even make camps there by bethesda.
---
Bro, I think I can help. First though, your original post needs a major grammar overhaul. If you're going to ask the community to help you do something very specific, your language needs to be clear.
---
Here's how you can set it up so that you can open the garage door from both the inside and the outside of your camp. Follow these instructions EXACTLY - even a slight deviation will result in failure:
---
* First, you need to have a pass-through conduit with the single center connection point facing outside. Place a wall-mounted, blue on/off switch on the outdoor side of the garage door. Run a power cord from the single center connection point of the pass-through conduit to the wall-mounted, blue on/off switch. Next, run a wire from the wall-mounted switch to the outdoor power connector on the garage door.
---
* Second, you have two indoor connection ports for the pass-through conduit. Connect a power receiver (downward-facing or upward-facing, your choice) on one of these two indoor connection ports.
---
* Third, connect power from your generator to the indoor power receiver. You can now use the outdoor switch to open and close the garage door.
---
* Fourth, place a computer terminal next to the indoor power receiver. Run a power cord from the terminal to the power receiver. This indoor terminal now controls the outdoor switch, meaning you can open and close the garage door using the computer terminal.
---
You now have a circuit to open and close the garage door from inside of or outside of your CAMP. Power flows freely to the outdoor, wall-mounted switch. The wall-mounted switch can open and close the garage door. The indoor computer terminal can remotely override the on/off status of the outdoor switch, allowing you to control the door anywhere in your CAMP.
---
Don't worry it will get back to 800
---
There is a situational way of doing as you suggest. I’ve found that if I tap a quickly, I hop
---
That’s why I hardly ever launch a nuke, unless I see half or most of the map over level 100.
---
I love Bear Arms. Carry 10 heavy weapons for the weight of a single rifle.
---
I 100% agree with this.
---
Its especially annoying when in group and running strange in numbers with bird bones.
---
Hey that’s igbal from employee of the month
---
It does disappear, the junk in the scrap box doesn't
---
I'll try that.
---
Im guna be pissed if they release the power armor plans. Ive been saving mine for trades and thats just guna kill their value.
---
Yeah, the wall is not included with the tires.
---
now you have a lot more room to horde chems.
---
Thats what I did.  Started hording chems.
---
Yep.  I noticed that too.
---
Yay me, I don't like any of it.
---
You naughty...
---
I feel for you.  Here I am walking along and a dead scorchbeast literally falls on top of me.  I'm looking at the map and nobody is anywhere near my location.  I felt so bad for that poor player who may have really struggled to kill this pest and it up and vanishes to my location.
---
It's a common misconception.
---
Hehe I know.
---
No, they're separate teams. That's what they keep telling us.
---
Also, you no longer need to make this exact thread every other day. This should really be moved to bethesda pls
---
That's been fixed
---
Idk what was happening but i can assure you you werent helpful for that event. If you're just walking aroung woth a flamer and not grabbing a pylon you aren't doing shit and are just there to mooch rewards off the people that know what they're doing.
---
Apply the green glowing effect that hovers over Legendaries when alive onto their corpses *and* eventual meat piles, in the event that you qualified to earn a Legendary weapon from these enemies. So you can know at a glance whether it's worth looting further.
---
Identifying Legendaries from the rest of the horde is taxing when pickups are lost amongst other dead bodies or the environment. Exacerbated by low FPS SBQ events - nuke zones generally tank my XB1 and hovering over endless corpses lost in Cranberry Bog foliage isn't conducive to good use of your time.
---
p.s this is my first Reddit comment in about 5 years, hi-ho everyone
---
I think you are certainly going to get it, sounds fun.
---
I've hoping for this as well. I'd also like to see a case that takes less items but lets you display larger items, like Jangles. I have several of these I'd like to display. 
---
Although it baffles me at some of the things that cant be displayed for some reason.
---
&gt; obnoxious
---
uhhhhh
---
If you went through the comments, you'd see I addressed that. I love this game (even it works), and the community of people I have on the game are worth sticking with. Remove the word felony and replace it with infringement if you'd prefer.
---
You were the one who started the argument and asked the questions. 
---
Just for the record: 
---
 (a) The canvas bags was sent when lawyers started preparing action against Zenimax for false advertising
---
 (b) the Christmas items on sale the day they were released were changed when people mentioned it was illegal
---
 (c) refunds were issued when the ACCC investigated and found they mislead customers
---
 (d) they tried to charge 500 atoms for a reskin of something released a week earlier, then backtracked. 
---
And separately, I believe there are a few disgruntled people who are genuinely leaking to mmofails; he was saying EA were trying to save anthem before Kotaku verified it. Given what I've seen, I'm behind his comment:
---
'I am still told that the community has a lot of impact on how Fallout 76 turns out, so don't quiet down and let them get away with whatever they wish, otherwise full P2W may be on the way. In fact, Bethesda will be introducing a few items that they consider "borderline" in the next few months. If the community remains quite about these pay to win utility items, Bethesda will just keep going.'
---
http://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/11/no-fallout-1st-players-arent-getting.html
---
Lol.  No, I don’t agree with solution.  I did UF all the time before the patch and often solo or with only maybe 2-3 others max.  It usually worked out.  I think the loss of the PvP mode and the change to public events caused UF to be a bad time.  I went from doing it at least once per day to I don’t even bother any more.  It’s just not worth it with so often you have an asshat in there.  Plenty of other events to score lego.
---
Like people can't just say awful things over their microphone.
---
I agree with the first part.
---
But the last part - let's just be perfectly blunt here - they've had very little to show for "our support" for the better part of a year now.  A lot of stuff just gets kicked down the road to Wastelanders and they clearly had no contingency plan for that delay.  Several bugs continue to go unfixed and even the Atomic Shop content has slowed to a trickle.
---
I once got *lucky* and got 4 *** star Legendary enemies in one spawn at Harpers Ferry. 
---
Lucky? Not much. 
---
Got only 1 *** weapon and it was a bloody walking cane. The rest of the loot was 1* vendor scrip :(
---
Finish the quests and start shaping your character into the one you really want.  Grind for high-end weapons and gear.  Replace QOL and Crafting perks with combat perks you can swap in and out. Most important have fun.
---
Agreed. It's my new outfit for the foreseeable future. Armored Skull Mask and the Ranger Advanced w/ Riot Paint.

---
So you sold the game to the pawn shop and the bought it again?
---
Super disappointing 😞
---
Are millennials killing the clickbait industry?
---
Sure, but that’s a limited range thing.
---
Not if I follow you.
---
mine can one shot if i was on killing spree
---
I focus mostly on mobs but always dump a few clips from my handmade into the bitch.  You have to get a certain share of damage to get loot share.  Otherwise asshats would just show up, do nothing, and score loot.  Or show up very late to the party and maybe still score loot for no work.  I love SBQ anymore because the team work, action, some crazy mobs and most everyone gets a chance at loot.  Even if mostly bad, it’s still worth it.
---
Yeah, I did. I've bought 7 copies of the game since it came out, multiple people in the house and whatnot
---
Going to preface this with saying that none of this is meant to be flamey (that's a word, right?) and I want to see this game succeed.
---
My initial gut response to your question would be that those issues - game being deeply discounted, Atom Shop not generating enough of a cash flow - is entirely on Bethesda themselves. The company's early mishandling of the game is what turned people off and led to that deep discount happening. If the cash shop isn't making money then that means you're not putting things there that people want to actually buy. 
---
With the game population being what it is, a subscription model was probably the best idea, yeah. But doing that at a time when Wastelanders was already hyped and slated for release and when the game seemed to be getting on the right track was another PR misstep. It drove more people away (maybe not a lot but some).
---
So - again, not meant to be antagonizing or troll or any of that - at what point do you (in a general sense, not necessarily you personally) choose to stop supporting a company because of their bad decisions and management even though you see a ton of potential in the product? That's where i'm at now and it sucks to have to wrestle with. It's even tougher when it's a beloved franchise like FO is.
---
You arent a whale but ok. Say whatever you need to say to justify your purchase to yourself because noone cares .
---
This is good advice.
---
I think this should be applied to Frog Legs in NW as well. Sometimes I want to do a regular hop onto a small object before a full leap onto a building. Instead, I have to do a full leap onto the small object, taking extra time to float down. Then I have to wait for Frog Legs to recharge to make the full leap. Meanwhile, I'm a sitting duck for about 2-4 seconds.
---
My friend runs a bloody build and took all 3 conduits and killed the imposter in two hits solo. 
---
I believe you need a very high energy damage resistance, lots of stims and lots of chems.
---
I think I bought it for the right reasons. 
---
I am a solo player. I move through areas really fast and like to do things in my own time. All I wanted was a world to myself, where I wouldn't have to be hunted or be constantly looking over my shoulder or waiting on other people who take 10 years looting an area. That's literally it. 
---
I do not regret my purchase at all. This game is my happy place lol
---
Q1 of 2020
---
What did you get with the "Set" and what does the description of the "Set" say in the Atomic Shop?
---
&gt;  they just recolored it 
---
The Ranger Advenced is not a mere recolor, it's a new mesh with new parts and actual differences. Whether or not it's 'different enough' for your liking is up to you, but saying they "just recolored it" is factually not true.
---
Do one straight after a queen and only do the first step, wait til it hits the 5-4 min mark on the timer while you wait for more players to show up then activate the second half.
---
How about you enter your questions in the search and you shall see. Or peruse all the patch notes and inside the vault entries?
---
...and we all now have dog-sized sentry bots that follow us and carry our extra gear. It’s cute when they bark
---
Yes until midnight GMT or 7pm EST
---
Makes a lot of sense.  Sometimes I just want to go into the Charleston Station and not jump onto the roof instead.
---
That's a fundamental misrepresentation of what happened. You're willfully obfuscating pretending that utility items that are paywalled aren't in clear conflict with their promises, before release, and when it was:

The first exhibit clearly shows this. Condescend to somebody else, the adults have things to do.
---
You’re the man. Thanks for the fast response!
---
Forget the emotes I want text chat to communicate.
---
sames. though as others have said, you quickly fill it with other shit, but it was nice to consolidate all my mule toons junk onto my main. So I have like 20k Crystal now
---
Thanks for sharing, as always, but also this time!
---
Yep. Kill your character. When you respawn it’ll be fixed.
---
Good luck with that. They are offering a new product for sale in their virtual shop. You don’t miss it on anything by not purchasing those items. I’m looking forward to you letting me know what the courts say.
---
I was explaining what Jagex did with their Premier members for Runescape, not Bethesda and Fallout 1st. I understand that it's a different thing, I was comparing Bethesda to Jagex in their laziness.
---
Thank you very much. I can now concentrate on getting more loot.
---
Like the ground looking different or oddly textured or colored? Or like your shadow looking like something it isn't?
---
I've had both of those happen, almost like having a black light flashlight shining on the ground wherever I went, making the terrain look really strange.
---
Starched Genes, Lone Wanderer, Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior, Picklock and Hacker perks.
---
Lol thatl be about 1900 atoms thankyou very much
---
I wish that were true, but many spend a lot of time trolling.
---
Hey, thanks for heads up but i'm boycotting Beth games so I'm not going to update this map anymore. Feel free to do it yourself if you want to tho =) Or anyone for that matter.

I miss the meat sweats.

Wastelanders can flop. Just give me that ceramic tile.

Welcome to Europe. Sub for month 15euros = 16.61 usd. :/
---
Havent played in a couple weeks. So bored of them doing absolutely nothing every few days w the updates.
---
no it looks like there's something stuck in my character model. every time I duck whatever is inside my model starts taking up half the screen
---
I just says cement filled tire set. No itemized list. The cement tire wall that matched the set is in one or more of the pictures. I have control of three individual tires of different sizes but no wall.
---
Always need more emotes (and dances FOR ALL)
---
But I like the icon overhead. I like to announce myself when trying to use a work bench at a workshop, I mean no harm. It never works though.
---
The whole point is self reliance. While its a control vault, it still technically has an expirement. It tosses its dwellers out with nothing but a few healables, and sees what happens.
---
You dont get a vault, you dont get a geck, all you get is yourself, and your friends.
---
I have also seen 200 thrown around. I haven't confirmed anything personally. Increased rarity of Meathook builds  on Adventure mode lately means most people have to contribute or else.
---
Stating this neutrally (not in endorsement or criticism, but to inform):
---
The atom shop is more than likely the reason why we get so few in-game updates to camp items, and also the reason why we don't get more of those FO4 assets (particularly not in any kind of bulk package). Anything they add to the game in those ways will undermine the 'trickle' approach to cosmetics that the atom shop shops uses to keep players wanting more so they're more likely to buy.
---
Personal opinion time: It's unfortunate and kind of bullshit. I've seen it from other games and yes it has a direct impact on the player experience. I don't hate the game over it, and I do buy from the atom shop so I'm not saying I hate its whole existence either, but in the end they're using retail tactics and treating us primarily as consumers they want to pull along and keep spending for years to come (games 'as service' type garbage). 
---
We got a lot more for less from FO4 and that's because it had no atom shop.
---
Haha
---
I have a very nice Handmade (love that gun) that does maybe 10% of a legendary mob’s damage, so a couple shots to tag them leaves plenty of health for others. I like to set an example.
---
Maybe it's a PC specific thing, I'm on ps4
---
this worked...thank you.
---
FYI- your “no, only cosmetic” screen shot is incredibly misleading as the tweet it was responding to has since been deleted. There was a question about if a person could buy a legendary mini gun in the atomic shop, the response was “no, only cosmetic”. Including the exhibit as you have it is a gross misrepresentation.
---
Oh my bad, thanks for clearing this up.
---
the problem is that sheepsquatch spawn under the ground and climb up. same with mirelurk queens
---
Actually, the money probably did not go to line Bethesda’s pockets.
---
Bethesda’s revenue is approximately 10,77mil (according to D&amp;B).  They have around 75 employees (not including development teams) so their operating expenses are around 700-800k / month.  Add to that marketing. Add R&amp;D. Add royalty payments. Plus taxes... basically Bethesda is barely breaking even... Short-term
---
Now Zenimax is a different story )
---
I use sentinel assassin all my armor is assassin. I wouldnt consider it useless
---
BE-25 fixer
---
I do. Because they advertised saying that those things they're adding would be free. And if they can't afford to offer them, despite that promise, then they shouldn't do it. If you don't understand that from my previous posts, I cannot help you.
---
It would've already gone to court if not for being delayed. But I'm like the sword of Damocles, hanging. I've been to VCAT hearings, seen how they go, and I'm almost certain I will win. Looking forward to letting you know.
---
Sure, I've never made a map like this though; how do you do it, can you teach me?
---
You must have known Bethesda's past history. This is what you paid for. How could you possibly be surprised?
---
Sorry meant on weapons. I have a set of assassins armor in my stash too, in case/for when Survival comes back.
---
That would be nice
---
You won with fat man :)
---
That is a definite need.
---
I understand that. It just makes no sense. Because it IS a control vault. If Vault 76 had the experiment that you described, I'd be absolutely fine with that. But it doesn't. It's a control vault. You're just making up your own head-canon in order to make it make sense. Because it doesn't make sense.
---
Two-shot gives you a damage increase of about 20% with an accuracy penalty. The advantage is you don't have to run at low health.
---
Bloodied by itself gives you a damage increase of about 200% without any accuracy penalty. The disadvantage is you have to run at low health.
---
If you combine Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction with Bloodied, which is very common, you get a damage increase of up to 351%.
---
Adding a Prime Receiver to a handmade has no advantage over a Hardened receiver except when you are fighting Scorched or Scorchbeasts.
---
A Prime Automatic Receiver gives you a 3.5% damage boost against non-Scorched/Scorchbeast enemies compared to the equivalent Powerful Automatic Receiver.
---
Im not sure what my username is, ill log in right and post it and add you
---
It could have been a ghoul slayers gamma gun, so you have that going for you.
---
You can't anymore. It was changed a few patches ago. The only way to kill pets now is if you engage in pvp with its owner.
---
In all honesty, i just wanted the atoms and the armor, everything else i couldnt care less about. plus i know the game is buggy and Bethesda is cracked in its current state, but that Shadow Prime paint is cool and thats the only reason i logged on
---
How did you get that info on your HUD?? What have I been missing all this time, I really hope that's a PC mod and I'm not an idiot...
---
with industrial armor and leg upgrades +200 weight
---
You're absolutely right - at some point each person needs to make that evaluation on their own.
---
I have not hit that point - I enjoy the game, and continue to do so. The fact that they have rolled out 1st, or collectrons, or fridges, or PA skins, doesn't bother me. It doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the game. I'm sure at some point I will get bored, find other games, or in some way stop playing 76 as much. When I do, I will cancel my 1st. If they do something that enrages me to the point some in this sub have reached, I will cancel 1st. Until then, I will continue to support the game (and the developers behind it), even if they aren't perfect.
---
And thank you for being civil - I know it can be hard when people feel strongly about a subject.
---
Wow, nevermind. I AM an idiot...you're looking thru your camera at a bunch of meat piles! LOL
---
I'd probably still scrap it for ballistic fiber.
---
My character with perks and armor and backpack is up around there anyway. Plus or minus 30lbs or so wasnt gonna hurt me enough to change the build.
---
On top of Seneca Rocks
---
Oh sorry yeah I agree then. Lol. Theres rumors about assassin being boosted up to 30% but i doubt it. Even it would make sense for a weapon intended for pvp would be have more damage. Cuz no one uses it for pvp.
---
There's no longer any mention of that on the 1st page, BTW...
---
That too
---
I don’t think the game is anywhere close to being programmed so detailed that it can calculate afk/vs one kill and deal a player all loot beyond that point. I think the simplicity of shoot it loot it is about all it can do. Especially considering how much work still needs to be done with the game
---
I'd ask Bethesda for a refund then. They didn't include a separate Tire Wall purchase. I'm guessing it's part of one of the bundles.
---
Correcting this glitch is my only major contribution to this sub. Glad it worked for you!
---
True, you won't get much worse roll than that one, lol
---
That would be better than what we have IMO
---
Well, that isnt a headcanon. Its literally the purpose of 76. Thats kinda why the vault was sealed and it wasnt issued with a geck. 
---
Check https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_76_terminal_entries#Mandatory_Shut_Down
---
It explicitly states the reasoning behind it.
---
They said repair kits would be free? I didn’t see that in your exhibits. 
---
I did however see your misleading screen shot where Pete Hines relies “no only cosmetic” which has the tweet he is responding to deleted. Someone asked specifically if you could buy a legendary mini gun in the atomic shop and he responded “no, only cosmetic”. Including the quote out of context is a gross misrepresentation. Again, It speaks to how disingenuous you really are.
---
Just an fyi u get the atoms the actual day of ur renewal but ur sub renewal gets charged 2 days prior. I panicked when i didnt get my atoms and that was what bethesda replied to me.
---
I'd ask Bethesda for a refund then. They didn't include a separate Tire Wall purchase. I'm guessing it's part of one of the bundles. If you select the tire wall from the CAMP build menu, it should take you to the purchase option in the Atomic Shop. That will show you where you're able to purchase that item.
---
Bethesda : we have decided to move Christmas to Q1 next year
---
There is no time limit to claim the Advanced Ranger Outfit as far as one can see; just make sure that you claim the outfit before your membership expires.
---
Well gosh Sarge, thank ya kindly!
---
It’s all about the studded deep pocketed heavy leather! Best ER in the game. With Vanguard, I’m over 500ER  IIRC.
---
640 is more junk than anyone will ever need .
---
These are all things we're taking into consideration for the next wave of event QOL fixes coming in 2020. Thanks for all the feedback on this!
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

Nice!
---
Unfortunately, nothing's really new. Everyone playing is either just hunting for legendaries or grinding experience. When I log in, I do a few daily quests, an event here and there, exchange my scrip, and then that's pretty much it for the day. It's why so many of us have resorted to just making new characters.
---
Im gonna guess that you have less than 3 mods unlocked for the radium rifle. Qq
---
Did you submit a ticket?
---
We've seen lots of requests for this and have passed it along. Thanks!
---

---
They could also make it so the legendaries come in as event rewards instead of loot, which would simplify the process.
---
Protip: Don't fill your base with display cases and stuff like that. Everything inside a display shelf also takes up build realestate. And a lot too. A simple magazine can take up several walls worth.
---
Wasnt the life support shut off in the vault?
---
Get all the acid
---
The company makes/owns ESO so they should have the ability.
---
It’s air was cut off to encourage vault dwellers to rebuild
---
IDK about all that, we had a 5 man group last night server hopping to run Encryptid, and we had a hell of a time finding servers with enough open spots for all 5 of us. Seemed outrageously busy for a Monday night
---
Escape artist &amp; Sneak
---
I cant tell you how much easier the game is with those two perks.  Only ever take them out for PA.
---
I've used a free software called paint.net. It's like MS Paint but with layers and few extra functions. It's pretty stright forward and easy to use. Just make a screenshot, cut out what you need with a circle selection tool and paste on a separate layer in case you wanna edit it in the future. Place it where you want, resize as you want and add a line that shows code's location on the map. I'd share my original file with all the layers but i've already deleted it =\
---
It's something to keep the hardcore fans busy until the next fallout/tes. Let them enjoy it mang.
---
god yes ! we so need chat!!!
---
I had the same problem, filed a complaint with Bethesda costumer service and got 1800 atoms for the trouble instead of normal 1650. It happens when you are a new member they told me. They are working on it is what Bethesda said
---
Isn't a bunch of fallout us turning things back on?
---
I may be wrong, but I recall this exact (literally identical) post being made a few days ago.
---
And I love fallout first just saying. Everyone on here can hate me but I love.
---
They had auto closing doors in F04, part of the Slocum Joe's DLC, they were amazing. I honestly wish we had that whole DLC for 76, built your own donut and coffee shop, had a working coffee bar, donut fryer, decor.
---
you happen to have a link to their customer service?
---
I use it for my rifle/commando build so imma double check it works
---
i have not, yet
---
I know a guy who has one, and he wants a JFFR fixer or handmade for it.
---
there is casual hate on it, but monthly atoms is really nice
---
[I don't know why you got down voted.  I got your reference Mr. Gates.](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/tech-myths/5-myths-about-bill-gates3.htm)
---
It’s help.bethesda.net
---
From there look for products then fallout 76 then atoms issues.
---
Really? What's the name of that DLC? I never played the side content when I went through FO4, wish we did have those assets then... That sounds awesome.
---
From what I have seen, it looks like the game prefers taking items from the player's inventory first, then the stash, and finally the scrap box. This makes some sense from a weight management point of view, it prioritizes freeing up space where that is immediately most useful. I think raw materials are also prioritized over junk, but storage priority takes precedence. In other words, if there is junk but no scrap in storage that is searched sooner, then the game will use that junk even if scrap could have been found in the next storage.
---
If vault 76 has no oxygen. How would u turn it on?
---
Only if bloodied or junkies. Now a 50 cal ts is shit to put it nicely, you miss so many hipfired shots and since it splits 125% by 2, you end up losing ~62% damage. I couldn't get half the bullets to go where aimed. But guns likes the handmade, it does pretty good.
---
Game is complete playable without the scrap box.  I always recommend no one get it until after level 75 or so cause stash management is a huge part of the game.
---
I think it's fine how it is. It's a good purchase for anyone invested long term who wants a little more daily playability.
---
I'd be pretty salty if I paid 100 bucks to get exclusive access to a skin swap tbh
---
Seriously... don’t rush it...
---
I really wish I had the private server on the first (or even second play through).  The ability to see the quests and staged items the way designers intended.  All the minor things in their place to help discern the story.
---
It’s like you are a detective.
---
The level you are at is ideal.  You are no longer the soft vault dweller, but still not the relaxed wastelands that can take on a few scorch beasts without breaking a sweat
---
Well do that first lol
---
If you harvest ticks for blood you can make them pretty easy. You can also get them with pharma farma on any med box and you can buy them from player vendors. Ghouls are also good for a handful of them and fighting high level enemies will sometimes get you super stimpacks as well.
---
gotcha
---
I RP the Mistress so the Order of Mysteries isn't truly dead.
---
Would you mind explaining?
---
It's also a real gun and its name sounds like it's from a Final Fantasy game. [PGM Ultima Hecate II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGM_H%C3%A9cate_II).
---
here's a new fallout 1st feature...
---
Come back and find out for yourself.
---
I did essentially the same thing but today is the the day that my FO1st month is up.  It's a sad day but it's not worth paying for another month for just that.  I'm about to set the game down until Wastelanders.  I might get another month then.
---
Whenever you see ticks makes sure you search them and collect any tick blood, then make them. You can't really farm stimpacks anymore I don't think but obviously have pharm farm perk and make sure you check the box and SEARCH the box,  Hit Y on Xbox ..
---
Also if you making them, make sure you got the chemist perk and superdupa perk at level 3 for maximum duplication ..
---
Also, it kind of bums me that in Nuclear Winter's lobby, they have working toilets, showers, sinks, coffee makers, espresso machines and even the medical equipment has functionality, plus more.
---
Keep it going.. Groups don't last forever!
---
I get this with fog and smoke too. It's really bad in the mire. It's not consistent either, so..
---
I'm hoping they fix it eventually, but it reminds me of the rainbow texture reflection bug in FO4 that AMD cards have had since forever that always kicks in after like an hour of playing for me, forcing me to restart the game or deal with Nick having a purple/black checker face like the texture vanished and bushes all being shiny wet with the texture of window frames. Number one biggest glitch in that game, for me. Made it so I could do barely anything before needing a restart for visibility.
---
Here it's not as bad.. At least I can usually see the game world past what seems like a crashing graphics driver issue..
---
I consider building a key part of the game, and it can result in many hours of fun if you're into it because you have to farm the resources and plans to build, plus invest the time.  Also, unlike farming a legendary set for endgame, you can easily swap to other characters and build on them without a huge time investment to get prepared.
---
I have four builder characters right now and I've been having a lot of fun switching between them as suits my mood.
---
Well, the game doesnt explicitly say it, but its definitely not a true control vault. It A) selected only the best and brightest for entry, meaning its already not a true control vault B) has no geck, no vault access C) overseer had a special mission D) the vault opened 25 years after the war, instead of 20.
---
That alone should say that it isnt just a headcanon, but is clearly an experiment. Its only a control vault in the sense that no experiments happened during the actual vault duration.
---
Not entirely wrong, honestly
---
The bffr Handmades go for 75k+ in trade recently it seems and bffr fixers are almost nigh unobtainable. I’ve offered 400k+ in trade value on multiple bffr fixers and was denied
---
It takes up some budget, but you can place 2 walls in the same spot, so you can have wallpaper on both sides. 
---
\~Place doorway
---
\~Place another doorway on the same spot
---
\~ turn both into walls.
---
\~Ta-da, interior wall that can have wallpaper on both sides
---
Maybe they fixed it and didn’t tell us.
---
Im offering a BFFR Fixer up and i'm getting 400k offers that i am declining atm 😅
---
Oh yeah, those pieces are super ugly and hard to get lined up right. I'd be happy with double sided power nubbies that auto-snap to 90 degrees to the wall they're placed on, ditto for ones that work on flat and angled roofs.
---
Only used chems to get my 5 addictions. Occasionally use whiskey for carry weight or grape mentats to purchase expensive things from the robot vendors.
---
I have ALL the Serums (19) in my vend for 266.00Caps each. Ps4, on tonight, search for georgepluck.
---
Grape mentats and almost any beer/ale for the Charisma bonus when selling/buying at vendor bots.  Whisky on occasion if I am close to overcapacity for the +2 strength. Never brew just find in the wild but grape mentats I craft.
---
Agreed, I would love to see crying emotes and others as well as long as the character actually does the action instead of some animation floating above their head
---
No, it’s my understanding that tenderizer doesn’t work, and hasn’t for a while now. I wasted 3 points on it.
---
I got mine
---
I had someone help me out tremendously the other day as well! I hadn’t logged in probably months (still low level) and some 100+ level offered to team up, dropped me weapons, ammo, and helped me find a PA frame 😭 bless.
---
Doesn’t work!!!!!! Move those points!!!!
---
My characters name is general custard and wants return the world to cowboyism , by any means necessary ,
---
20 bucks for new abraxo PA armor
---
We've all been there. I'm L192 and went through a whole host of post end game activities before finally grinding to a halt when 1st came out. I'm not suggesting you try all of these but this is what I did.
---
* Get the backpack of your choice. I went for the armored one.
---
* Collect all the body armor you need. Slowly mod them all to have what you need. I use BOS combat armor with all deep pockets. Swap out with legendary parts as you find them, and re-apply the mods. I spent a while looking for Scout armor. Do not bother.
---
* Acquire all the mods for the PA you use (calibrated shocks, torso mods etc.)
---
* Get the X-01 and Ultracite PAs. I eventually scrapped my perfect T-60 and T-51B as I couldn't even sell them. Now I have Excavator, X-01 and Ultracite, but never use the ultracite... so maybe skip that unless you enjoy the challenge.
---
* Slowly, slowly get all the perks you need to match your weapon of choice. This can only happen above L50. Research well first.
---
* Buy enough of the serum recipes to consume all five major flux types that you get from nuke events. They are great for quickly making money from vendors but even with max charisma cost about 17,000 caps each.
---
* Snipers benefit from the Herbivore mutation, as many of the foods that benefit only work on them. This is not well known... anyway. Make Sunshine Oil (+400 AP) and store a bunch as it doesn't spoil. Sweet tato stew is great too.
---
* Do you know that if you have the plans for an armor piece, you can make one with super high charisma and it is created with greatly improved endurance? I had planned to remake most of my body armor but you cannot retain the legendary effects, so no point, HOWEVER you can make power armor pieces with much better endurance IF you have the plans. Finding plans can take a while. You will already have all the Excavator plans and can gain the Ultracite ones. Even I haven't finished this yet.
---
* Make your CAMP inside an existing structure, just because you can, and it can never be completely destroyed.
---
* Go back to some of the areas that whipped your ass the first time you went there and make it your own. For me it was Beckly and those damn strikebreaker Assaultrons.
---
* Collect treasure maps and do map runs collecting piles of stuff. You find armor plans there sometimes.
---
* I have never done a vault raid. The sound like they suck.
---
* I have launched precisely one nuke.
---
* Make sure you have visited everything. There are plenty of unmarked locations with great backstories.
---
That's all I have for now.
---
The Moonshiner’s Shack just south of Vault 76 has 3-4 Ticks. Just don’t kill them if they are red; that means they’re full of blood and will explode and you can’t loot them. 
---
Loot the Tick Blood and Tick Blood Sacs from them. Equip Butcher’s Bounty to harvest more Tick Blood Sacs; these get you 2 Antiseptic, which you’ll need.  You should end up with about 4 Tick Blood and 6 Tick Blood Sacs (12 Antiseptic)
---
2 Tick Blood &amp; 1 Antiseptic = 1 Blood Pack (2 with Chemist)
---
1 Blood Pack, 1 Antiseptic &amp; 1 Steel = 1 Stimpak (2 with Chemist)
---
 4 Tick Blood = 4 Blood Packs = 8 Stimpaks. 
---
Each Tick is essentially 2 Stimpaks with the right perks. And honestly, with Super Duper 3, it’s more like 2.6. So you should net about 10 Stimpaks from those 4 Ticks, and only takes about 3 minutes total. 
---
You can also find 8 Ticks at Big B’s Rest Stop in the Mire, and 4 more at Lake Eloise in the Savage Divide.  That should net you like over 40 Stimpaks in total.
---
Butcher's Bounty perk let's you search them again. Between that and Pharma Farma, stims are one of my bigger sources of income.
---
A facepalm-emote would be nice though
---
I’ll second that.
---
Best rolls from purveyor bffr rw plasma pistol, bffr +perception gatling plasma, v ffr fr 50 cal., Unyielding ap Sentinel leather left leg level 1 lol.  Best fixer from trade aa ffr fr
---
The story. Your PC or his or her parents were identified as “the best and brightest” and for 25 years or your whole life you’ve trained and prepared to build America. 
---
Leaving the cushy Vault open so you can hide in it or fight over its dwindling and finite resources would make no narrative sense. 
---
You’re trained to use Power Armor and repair nuclear reactors in order to rebuild the country not cower in the Vault. 
---
Vaults only remain functional long-term if purpose built as an experiment (e.g. Vault 13 or 101). That’s why everything is failing/falling apart in every other Vault that outlived it’s purpose. 
---
Control Vaults kicked people out and shut down. Vault City notwithstanding.
---
Ughh 😤
---
Equip chemist and Super duper along with Butcher's Bounty: farm tick blood sacs, turn into bloodpacks, turn into stimpacks. You get like four times more than you would have otherwise
---
Love em. You can truly get some game breaking numbers, especially if you're a bloodied ninja on a bunch of different melee boosting meats.
---
I myself love to cook and take a ton of drugs. Always rock around 5 addictions for an optimal effect since like half my weapons are Junkies.
---
Found out months ago, sorry you’re a bit late. Move those points or get lone wanderer, or the team experience boost one.
---
curved walls/floors, spiral stairs, stairs that hug walls etc... My life would be complete haha.
---
This is what I do as well. No fails with enter yet
---
Ballistic Bock and Calmex.
---
Tick blood -&gt; blood bag-&gt; stimpak. 
---
 The little events/dailies geared towards lower lvl players also reward healing items more often than not.
---
And the ability to stick glowy stars and planets on the ceiling over my bed!
---
My character is a scared, Alcoholic, former BOS knight that worships Mothman.
---
The Furious FFR Gatling Gun is great for economic SBQ fights. Prime it and you get up to around +80% damage at a decent firerate against her (better than Zealot's Prime of +65%).
---
Thank you for you help I’d also like to say I totally get what you mean about grammar I have some issues like dislexia, autism and ADHD that being said I will try and do better next time 🙂
---
Im on PS4 and the last time I did it solo it was too.
---
If you don't participate you deserve nothing and get nothing, it's not fair for those that DO the event and you get to reap the rewards for being a lazy piece  of *censored for reddit's sake* that think's your playing with only AI that will do the work for you, it disgusts me when people crouch around not doing anything like in the event at Morgantown airport where there are people crouching away and not doing anything just waiting for the event to be over and get to loot the air drop for doing nothing,  *censored for reddit's sake* man of all the times I've seen people crouch around events while I do most of the work along with others and they go around crouching away, probably scared of people seeing their name and will try to pvp them for not helping out during the event
---
Pls send pics
---
Thank you.
---
how often do things come back out of the vault?
---
I really hate that event, it is usually a shit show and since I snipe from the shed roof top I loose track of where the sheepsquatch is and then it dies and I can never find the body to claim the loot. I just rather stay away than be frustrated by it.....
---
I’ve had shit luck farming tick blood. They usually asplode and I don’t get any blood. So instead, I head to Whitespring and hit up all the vendors for their blood packs. On a good run I can get a half dozen or so, a bad run will net me 0-2. With Hard Bargain maxed out, I can buy them for 37 caps (although I also have a full set of Unyielding which tweaks my charisma.)
---
Then equip Chemist and Super Duper and do your thing.
---
I agree except that I would not be willing to pay for items that were in the previous game. To me, that content was included in FO4’s price tag. I paid for FO76 and they already charge an absurd amount for stuff in the Atomic shop as it is
---
This is one of this urban myths of 76 that people were told was wrong when it started but refused to listen.  Camping there doesn’t block the bot’s spawn!
---
its probably always been in the game, semi rare, as it they can be picked up in the world.
---
the weapon or the perk? what is broken about it? is there proof? has it been verified elsewhere?
---
Craft them yourself. I craft them to sell and they never stay in stock for long. Farm ticks  for tick Blood (use max butcher's bounty) and then craft blood packs to use with steel and antiseptic (using max super duper) to make stims.
---
Yeah. It's kind of pointless unless it's on like a 50cal mg that has 1 mod. But everything else it take off like 2 pounds after modding
---
Whats supposedly broken about it?
---
my second shots do more damage just like they are supposed to.  And it stops when I take this perk off.
---
Yes please
---
My character is just desperate for beans on toast
---
What platform are you on?
---
you're confusing it with soccer.
---
so then.. just wear the normal ranger armor?
---
I'm on XB1 and hadn't completed that event for at least 2-3 weeks. I did it last night and had the same experience.  Every container, even the top locked ones were empty.
---
Wow didn't see all the down votes lol. I know, I was joking. I'm an American living in Scotland and I get shit for calling it soccer all the time
---
alright, i found one last night in someone’s vendor for 99 caps. picked it up cause i had never seen it
---
I'd rather get the Anti-Material Rifle added to the game. Wouldn't even care if the ammo cost a bit more for less, that would complete the ranger get up.
---
Feels bad although Ive only had this build so long. Prob gonna do either 2 points in field surgeon or lone wander, with inspirational. Thanks for the info.
---
You can still find Grahm wandering around from time to time. He's a trader.
---
Bumped into him the other day outside of Charleston Train Station.
---
thats an okay price, sold a couple for 300ish caps I think. its also kind of cool looking :-)
---
Two pick locks and two hacker perks just seem like an absolute waste when you could have four better perks to improve your damage output or resistance and rotate them in when and where you need them.
---
Bloody mess, tank killer, starch jeans are always on
---
What’s a trap base?
---
i just hope you aren't planning to use VATS anytime soon then.
---
A base setup to kill other players so they can steal their junk.
---
I agree in the game some of it was contrived but i sure felt the Order of Mysteries one was one that had done it so well and in a compelling fashion. There was no other that i did with such a feeling of 'i have to find out' even when the likely ending was coming clear it still kept you going right until the last line on the holotape.
---
Like you knew it was coming but you just hung on there with morbid fascination.
---
I wonder if we'll see any of the Order return with Wastelanders... :O
---
I get a pleasure out of bases charging 25k for preserved pie. That shit is pretty much worthless
---
The 90% reduced weight impacts the weight of the base gun, not all the mods.
---
The mods have their own weight, and add to the weight of the gun.  These mods are not affected by the legendary effect.
---
This system actually makes a lot of sense. Lets use a real world example
---
A standard mass produced AR 15 weighs about 7 pounds.  You can get one for 5-600 bucks.
---
A non standard custom ultralight build from a premium supplier can get as light at 3 pounds (titanium builds, skeletized receivers, ultralight barrels and bolt carriers, ect).
---
When you put a 4 pound scope on the premium weapon it no longer weighs 3 pounds, it weighs 7,  When you add a heavy stabalized stock, you add another 5 pounds, now your ultralight rifle is up to 12 pounds.  Now you add a laser sight and/or an illuminator, add another pound, your up to 13.  Where as your standard is up to 17 pounds.     The skeletized stock and ultralightweight components of the rifle dont impact how much your add on components weigh.
---
I got one for 25 caps. I didnt realise they were worth more.
---
I have the plan to make them, I think.
---
ESO isn't made in the Creation Engine though, it is made in the HeroEngine which is specifically made for online MMOs (and that engine is not made by Bethesda). Yes, they should have made Fallout 76 in that one, but the cost of using someone elses Engine was probably too high for a small studio side-project.
---
That was well writte/voiced as i recall, particularly as just a flavour drop to illustrate the final plight of the airport defenders
---

---
Try this, I presume you arent interested in vats or Bloodied build
---
I don't think your average player has ever encountered a trap base.
---
So you nuke them?
---
That's one way I guess you can protest about ridiculous prices.
---
I think a base that is rigged with traps. Like a base on a high cliff with a trap that launches you off the edge to your death
---
Totally what the game needs.  Why they haven't focused on this is beyond me.  There is so much potential for custom game modes and multiplayer pvp classic modes.  If I were running the show it would be very high on the list to create custom lobbies.  
---
Imagine creating your own multiplayer matches based around standard load outs/aid items that each player starts with?  
---
The base seige idea??  YES!
---
So much can be done with this.
---
What do you usually buy the calmex for? Mine doesn't move. I think I price them too high.
---
No. Containers are instanced, so as long as you tagged the body, there should be loot in there specifically visible to just you. This isn't the case for every enemy, though. For the SBQ, you have to also damage it enough to get loot from it. Shooting it once won't guarantee a loot drop unless you're someone who can take out the queen in one shot.
---
**YOOOOOO** I would kill for one of those bad boys! Or a furious fast explosive chainsaw.
---
Then the challenge is that lucky roll for a decent 3\* *and* it magically happening to be Heavy
---
ok good to know. thanks 8)
---
That was the old school way of displaying your trophies. I doubt anyone really expects to sell one for that price.
---
They're slightly better than the Elite one. Bethesda didn't match either design very well.
---
I'm only level 59 on PS4, and I haven't seen one yet. I did come across a really cool underground one. Where you had to play an instrument to be glitched into the camp, but no traps.
---
Honestly most players I have come across have been pretty awesome.
---
What is your average price for chems?
---
Can you cite some examples for proof?
---
My bloodied character is based off of the trashcan man
---
All the trap base builders I know don’t take peoples junk, they just do it for the challenge of building it and the reactions which it receives. Which most of the time is very positive we laugh they laugh and every one has had a fun experience.
---
I found one today for 20k. Then a few more ok weapons for absurd prices. They're out there..... They always are -_-
---
Ah yes, Iron Fist. For all that punching you will be doing with a sniper rifle.
---
I agree with this
---
I also use it to assert my dominance over them XD
---
I did not get my atoms on the month-to-date day, I got them a day or two later. I would submit a ticket to Bethesda though.
---
I love buffs but food is usually enough for me unless i go into higher level areas. So I tend to sell my chems, they all sell eventually at the right price except rad drugs. I personally love my Radx, chomp it regularly and walk thru rad storms, reactors, and ghoul fights without issues.
---
Since no on else buys radx i get it cheap from other players when I can. I cook radaway and only rarely sell it at 7 caps. May drop it down to 6 if i need the stash space.
---
Medx is a wonderful drug for larger fights at low levels.
---
The way it happened for the mistress and her daughter was a neat end. Personally I didn't care for the way too lengthy fetch quest but the building was way too detailed I feel for them to abandon it forever so I am sure they might have a resurgence in the future. Maybe other settlers will be inspired.
---
80 caps or less.
---
I nuke bases that put a rad shower in the way.   
---
I have a friend that nukes bases for high prices. 
---
I have another friend that nukes bases when people fill the vendor up with junk costumes instead of armor.

I have another friend that nukes bases that fill their misc up with bobby pins.

Nuking bases isnt a rarity.
---
The greatest tragedy of F76 is that the decided to see if they could stretch their old (but upgraded) Engine into multiplayer instead of using the same proven Engine they used for the much more successful ESO. Imagine if we had stable servers and a real MMO-like population in a much larger appalachia. Could have been so great.
---
lmaoo that exactly happened to me today, I saw the glowing one and I even shot it but it didn't register for some reason. Also they always steal those kills 🙄
---
Did it for the discount atoms really.
---
What we know so far is that existing locations will be changed.
---
I have heard but cannot confirm that the brick walls use more budget than the others? Is this true?
---
Two characters. An old merchant guy scavenging every corner of the wasteland and rebuilding America thru commerce. And a drunk swordsman farmer who wants to settle down somewhere and brew himself a horde of alcohol.
---
BECAUSE THE FREE STATES ARE THW BEST FACTION
---
I love it (sarcasm) when people come to an event, stand around doing nothing, and then thumbs down when the event fails. Happened quite a lot with Meat Week.
---
Not trap bases.   
---
Only when they put the rad shower in the way of their vendors. 
---
My toxic goo doesnt grow on trees, its a valuable commodity, and I should need to use it because someone doesnt know how to put their shower in a corner like normal people
---
So that's why I've moved back to the forest.
---
 My junk costumes sold cheaply for low levels might get me nuked somewhere else.
---
Yeeea I love it.
---
I swear to god if I see one more free states or raider item added to the atom shop im gonna have a flash back to when my brother ripped our pet turkey gerald apart with his bare hands
---
Happened to me once, back when you had to pay caps to get to that event. My low level ass dropped a bunch of caps I really couldn't afford, only to find out the hard way that I'd inadvertently bit off more than I could chew. And then the game crashed.
---
For reals, I got a bolstering sentinel yesterday and it's light combat, lol
---
With as much as they boasted about the biggest map fallout has ever seen i doubt the expand it
---
This post was already made, stop karma farming
---
If they added those into the game, I'd have to start using the Fatman for the nukes.
---
It's the only way to be sure.
---
I'll give it a try - sounds good.
---
It’s probably going to work with wastelanders
---
Very much agreed. I made this a while ago as it felt wrong to just leave them there like that.

In fact, I'd go as far as to say the writers Bethesda have been using since Fallout 3 and Skyrim are oddly good at writing 'comic/pulp vigilante' characters. For a start of Nick and Piper are basically right out of comic books. But the Silver Shroud questline is my favourite in the entire series if not RPGs in general,  The Super-Human Gambit and Grayditch quests were gems in Fallout 3, and even the Nightingale portion of the Thieves Guild in Skyrim was oddly satisfying to someone who has long been into comics.
---
I'm just hoping we can do something with the Order of Mysteries, or meet a retired or escaped Initate or Sister, in Wastelanders. As it is there is little reason to ever return to the Mansion other than nostalgia, and I say that as someone who keeps their main character in the full outfit and mains stealth-pistol despite its flaws for the theme.
---
every few months or so - it seems
---
Maybe they aren't a bloodied build so think it is helping other players?
---
I would only ever nuke a base that is internationally trying to kill other players or is a known scammer.
---
In the future it could but with Wastelanders I highly doubt it. It's all about having NPCs Infest the current map.
---
I’m fine with that. Forgot about my tech data until I looked today and I’m just shy of a thousand haha
---
I never use stimpaks I have food on my favorites bar. Along with a steady diet of radx I have lots of health at a slower regen rate. So I sell them all for 8 caps. Can easily sell for ten caps but i have a rep for cheap prices and it helps me get repeat business on all my goods so I keep stimpaks low to get folk in the door.
---
I wouldn't say "no one"
---
It’s for a unique Stealthly Loud build, hence the unique price point 👌
---
Focus on rifle build at first then when yu have most perks yu need for it add a couple of perks for melee also remember luck has a lot of perks that benefit all builds like bloodymess which adds xtra damage to all weapons what platform are gonna play on Xbox pc or ps4
---
(Sell them now)
---
Yeah, best perk period imo
---
Is there a link for datamined Xmas stuff? I want some Xmas gear but will stop hunting atoms if they drop it the week of Xmas like they did the Halloween themed items.
---
That's right - we're doing the heavy lifting.
---
Thanksgiving pardon me.
---
I have never seen a trapped base in person
---
I’d love me some capture the flag..
---
It's the water fountain in the gazebo near the clubhouse.
---
this..
---
they arent trying to sell it, they are showing off...
---
I never knew until mischief night. There may be others but there's one at the start gazebo just past the tennis court (by the clubhouse)
---
That's what I thought, but it's not always on.
---
I tried to tame my first Deathclaw whilst doing this Quest.
---
It didn't end well....................for me :-(.
---
I want that and also raise you giant snakes. Tell me some sorta mutant anaconda wouldnt be right at home in the Mire.
---
Sometimes I have to click drink a couple of times before it registers, but it always works.
---
There's nothing in the esm that indicates it doesn't work. Do you have some source or examples that we can look into?
---
&gt;It's always been a public event, *just now it's announced*
---
&gt;*just now it's announced*

If you're going to nitpick someone's comment, you should at least read it first.
---
Not this fountain, the metal fountain attached to the wall.
---
Getting op legendary weapons so j can mow through the new quests
---
It’s okay I appreciate the honesty of your post, obviously you’re going to give your opinion of the game. Id say the downvotes were unjust as its not like you were rude or anything but to be fair everyone in this sub probably enjoys the game so that’s probably why they disagree. I’ll give the game a try after im done replaying fo4 but go in with a pinch of salt.
---
I've been lucky so far, everyone I've done UF with takes turns tagging the legendaries before we kill them
---
Queens queens queens. 
---
Cheap after I swapped main back to melee. :-)
---
I’m Lvl 150 and I’ve never seen one on PS4
---
yeah, but from a video game standpoint the 90% reduction works when you mod some gear and is lost when moding other gear.
---
and really, when you get a 'basic' hunting rifle (tsew) you have to leave it as a crappy weapon or loose a legendary star just making it a  'useful' weapon.
---
I've been compiling a list of punji board users and raiders in general for this purpose.
---
Chems are for selling to robot vendors and occasionally other players.  Never touch the stuff myself except for an occasional stimpack or radaway.
---
Everything here is wack. Only new item is blue wallpaper? Come on man. I started playing The Outer Worlds last week and im glad I finally did. Ive been a fallout fanboy since 2000, but this has got to stop.
---
[I do it like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c455bc&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71ao0an0ar0p00cu0&amp;w=p80p90c52i30ia0ij2i42iq2at1lm2pa0&amp;m=8c&amp;nw=&amp;n=) 
---
I dip my toe into melee for backup
---
Lol does the voice sound effect alert enemies and breaks your stealth? I play heavy gunner or 2h melee so.
---
Yes. So much ammo wasted for a 1 in 10 chance at getting loot.
---
As far as I have understood due to reports, the lack of bug fixes is because they were all were planned to be implemented into wastelanders. It’s going to be a overhaul to the game and change its mechanics, but because of its delay, most of these will continue until its release. instead of fixing it now, then realizing that the fix would mess with the new patch/dlc. I have heard though they chose 4 or 5 to fix that they felt were comfortable to do. 
---
I’m really excited for its release but what they can do in the meantime is have better support. Hell, even if it’s kinda blunt like, we will not be able to do anything until February so we can have a smooth transition. We would still like to hear from them besides a weekly/monthly note.
---
Looking for these?

I've done this event many, many times and usually win though the one time I did the quest and initiated it the first time it would not work ( someone must have done it a few hours earlier ) and there were a lot of players available.
---
So I swapped servers where there were not that many high levels but decided to go for it. The event started but failed totally -the worst result ever. I was the only one aside from one other guy grabbing the pylons so we never had all 3 going.  Then later that night I had 2 more attempts and both times as we were getting the upper hand towards the end the game froze - so f\*&amp;k.
---
Every time I hear someone say “whale” in this sub, all I can think of is Griffin saying, “HEY MEG”!
---
I'm almost positive a thing came out from bethesda saying u had deal around 1000 damage to her to get loot to keep the people from joining at the end or just hitting a couple shots on her then waiting and still getting the loot
---
Clever, never knew this...I’ll definitely have to try it out.
---
Mostly dailies and visiting camps, buying cheap legendaries for scrip or for flipping in my own vendors.
---
The communist stuff is cool but still no Xmas. Even if it’s the tacky red pa with lights hanging off of it. I figured they’d have a Santa’s suit and an elf in the store by now with a tree but I’m dead wrong when it comes to bethesda once again.
---
Thank you for pulling that btw.
---
Ok, I'm at the tennis courts...I always assumed this was the clubhouse area?
---
There's that good old r/fo76 positivity. Have you even seen the videos I'm talking out?
---
Shhh Betheada may hear you and switch back to take a picture while wearing pijamas in the mire while a nuke is above you and you are in a party that's wearing raider power armor and are kneeled next to you
---
Me too, replaced my shovel backpack with it. Works better with my green hood and Leather Coat
---
I've seen one on ps4.  I'm 113.  It included a fall to your death chute ,  unless in PA.
---
I mean, it doesn't make sense for any control vault to shut down. Or at least, not to shut down immediately. Give people time to rebuild, but have a safe space to return to in the meantime. Then shut down after an indetermined amount of time, however long they think it should take to rebuild to a stable state. Throwing everyone to the wolves and just hoping they survive and rebuild, doesn't make sense. Unless you have infinite people, which they don't.
---
I didn’t know I needed this
---
That's a very fair assessment. You're not wrong. Maybe we can get both! :D
---
They can be found as a spawn in Appalachia antiques.
---
Read maybe half of that and it sounded like a second job 😂 but we're all doing it in our own way I guess
---
Once you're at the tennis court, spot the gazebo, and search the fountain on the little wall around it.
---
Great point.

This was today's discovery. There are two plans that can drop in the festive event (whenever that drops) that are Christmas related. One is lights but I'll have to get the other one later.
---
It's early, but I wouldn't doubt if they used last year's assets.
---
Sounds like it hanging tight for a set of light icicles! Lol
---
You may certainly try you commie bastard
---
*ssssh* I am eagerly awaiting OP's real world examples of Junkie's weapons.
---
The boy was kidnapped in a misguided attempt to focus his father's attention on the results of business decisions he had made. There is no pedophilia involved.
---
The real question is is it bugged or is it just not showing the damage numbers correctly?
---
Whaaaaat we can get a mr fuzzy tag now!?
---
I carry a back up powerfist on him already.
---
I’ve got 3370 .45 to trade! I don’t use it at all and it’s been building up
---
What would you suggest?
---
Playing other games
---
He is a 100% correct
---
Wow...Look at that exclusive skin for 1st members. Its the same thing as the last 2, Now with a bonus chest belt!!!
---
Bethesda, you shouldn't have. No, Really. You shouldnt have. It just shows how little creativity you have. I want to stick with this game, I enjoy it. I really do. But Bethesda... You really killing my vibe, man. 
---
I'm patiently waiting for Path of Exile's next expansion. Now thats a cash shop I can and do support.
---
The Mistress build does only one thing that can never be surpassed, most everything about it is pretty minor. Even the sneaking bonus from the Garb is beaten by the sneak legendary bonus on armor. The Voice of Set is kinda gimmicky and is actually better replaced by another gun.
---
The only thing the build excels at is the 100% armor penetration on the Blade of Bastet, no other legendary effect, perk, mod, or combination of gives 100% armor penetration. It caps out at 88% for melees and even less for guns.
---
 So, in my opinion you should focus on a sneak melee build. You're gonna want every damage bonus you can muster: food buffs, damage perks, chems (I know it's against their ethos but they're dead and you're not) and maybe even a few mutations to really make sure you're bringing things down in one hit to not lose your sneak
---
While the store is still expensive, appreciate the chance at these free state items as I've been on a 2 month hiatus and haven't seen them before.
---
(Ideally though they would just keep everything/most items available all the time)
---
Well, I'll take 2500 off your hands and you can have the armor.
---
I got 2 TSE .50cals, a JE minigun and a TSE submachine gun over about 2.5k scrip so I think I did pretty good. Also got quite a few decent explosive weapons
---
And yet I bet some people bought it with glee because who cares if you get ripped off.
---
I'm a little new here, but is there anyone or any bots who update what the new items in the atomic shop are and what is free? It would be amazing if there was someone I could follow or a subreddit that gives you updates
---
Look man. I get that you wish it was different. You keep saying there’s no reason. People keep providing reasons. You can disagree with the reasons but it’s not a good look to keep denying that there are reasons and acting like it’s crazy. 
---
It makes you look crazy honestly. Good luck.
---
Well straight of the bat there’s long shot that would improve the range and accuracy of rifles which I assume is something may benefit a sniper build more than pick lock. You could also put some points into vats perks in intelligence to help with efficiency, but I always like serendipity but that’s a personal preference. It’s really down to you but having pick lock and hacker equipped while fighting isn’t benefiting you at all.
---
So, it's official, the thing is currently so bad we are asking to pay for a feature that doesnt increase the game upkeep for Beth.
---
But you are a code
---
Oh man, I thought you were going to ask for a pouch!
---
My idea:  Add a pouch!
---
Still no Nuka Cola Fridge, so I will have no fridge.  
---
Any free items for non Fallout 1st suckers?
---
That happened to me, except fire damage, a couple weeks ago. It was actually listed as a disease but disease cures didn’t fix this at all. Had to leave and come back out of the game.
---
Semi auto .50 cal barret
---
I know a way to do it through walls; but they sit on the floor. The advanced power conduits it's a little stub and a single conduit line like "0-" remove the wall and place this on one side, connect another to the other side then AFTER that you place back down the wall. It won't work with a wall in between but the wall can be placed back after.
---
IF you'd like I could show you a picture but I've just started my work shift.
---
That it isn't.
---
The reason why the legendary effect - which has no more basis in the real world than any of the other legendary effects do, is all magical Wasteland mumbo-jumbo - does not apply to the mods is because design laziness.
---
The effect would have to be coded in a rather more complex way in order for it to account for the weight penalties of mods.
---
Is easier to leave it be and trust players to come up with horseshit explanation about why it works the way it does and why it makes sense for it to do so.
---
Now I am off to shoot things with my modified SPAS 12 which shoots 1.25 slugs per cartridge and increases the muzzle velocity of the ammunition in function of the amount of LSD I have taken, because that is totally a thing.
---
lol I’m not sure if it could alert enemies, but seems like the drop off distance is very short, i can only hear the speech when I’m right next to one. I don’t think the game would ruin your stealth because of it 😂
---
I regularly use PsychoBuff and Ballistic Buck, that together with the Furious effect and 10% more damage while aiming. I can do 195% damage.
---
Otherwise I always take Grape Mentats, together with the Charisma card when I need to buy a Serum Recipe. (Only one to go!!)
---
I just craft what I need? I am a real looter, so I find plenty of Psycho and Buffout. And the ingredients for Ballistic Buck aren't at all difficult to get.
---
I just have them hotkeyed to 2 and 3 and just press those when I go into any big fights or panics.. (Like having all the ghouls of the golf building on your butt :p) Kinda wish there were options to how more clearly how much time is left on the effects you have in the UI.
---
&gt;Until then the poor boys can suck it.
---
\[You've lost karma\]
---
Can I get an icon in cornflower blue?
---
Why Calmex and not of the others? Is 15% more sneak damage better then 25% more damage in general?
---
My preferred method is to sell L's for a reasonable price, then server hop checking out vendors doing the same.  Far better luck getting weaps and arms that "fit".🙂
---
Yeah a picture would be great, no rush, whenever you get around to it. Thanks!
---
One pristine soul.
---
Proper spec into heavies with the right combination of legendary modifiers makes a flamer a very good support weapon, vamp and limp damage is my go to flamer for this event.
---
I lost karma lol
---
It’s a deal! What’s your PSN?
---
That's a fallacy.
---
You are trying to prove that buy FO1st is a good thing because they are doing nothing wrong, you are doing nothing wrong and have bill to pay.
---
These things are not direct related.
---
"bad" is different from "wrong"; and even "bad" must have a reference.
---
it's not bad for you yo buy it, but it's likely bad for the possibilities this game can still develop on the future - in both cases, it's not wrong.
---
Had that happen to me also; not sure if it's because it treats them like other containers, and it hasn't reloaded, of if the event isn't loading in properly.
---
ESO's engine has major flaws with combat feel. Fo76's ranged attacks feel much better. Melee is bad in both.
---
lol
---
Your better off with a suppressors cryolator.
---
It's like a soldier salute.
---
I like using Berry Mentats for Always Vigilant; I use psychobuff occasionally for big fights, like SBQ, and AWOL.
---
I've been setting up the Minutemen by 
---
1. Rebuilt a version of the Castle
---
2. Recruiting but Recruiting members that are dedicated
---
3. Gearing the Minutemen with Military type Armor-Must all have similar atire
---
4. Making sure the faction has at least 100k Caps so we can bargain for anything
---
5. Waiting
---
You're forgetting the Gauss Rifle, which is one of the best sniper rifles in the game. I personally love guns that charge up, too. 
---
But if we're asking for a sniper rifle back from a previous game, we can't forget the Bozar.
---
Absolutely, was just having this conversation at work the other day.
---
Frankly would've been taking a break if I hadn't subscribed to 1st. 
---
I already cancelled so I'm trying to bull up on scrap over 3 characters. 
---
I will re subscribe though when wastelanders comes out. I just don't want others ruining the narrative by leaving locked doors open or killing all the enemies before I have a chance to even see them. Just need to figure out if I want to do it with an existing character or a new one.
---
*haha emote followed by sad crying emote*
---
Generally speaking, money made from games goes towards development or keeping developers on their feet.
---
Definitely one of the more interesting quests in the game. I hope there is a superhero/vigilante faction in wastelanders
---
I put out a psa, people saying it works now. I’m not sure... need to try it myself. It was broken a while ago, assumed they never fixed it
---
It would be nice to be able to see some damage numbers so we could know how we are doing.. and if our builds are just too gimp.
---
All three of the salutes are different: Raider, Free States, and Communist
---
Yep, I finally gave in and bought one. That event has some really good loot, but I hardly ever see it.
---
Free fast travel to a place with a ton of vendors
---
If the Charging Sniper Barrel for laser guns actually let you charge it up like the Gauss Rifle or Tesla Rifle, it would suck a whole lot less. As it is you have to wait like two seconds for it to fully charge up on its own, for every shot, which is awful.
---
There's speculation that the Laser Musket will appear in Wastelanders. That wasn't the best sniper in Fallout 4 but it was a damn reliable, and efficient, performer through basically the whole game. I'd definitely use it again.
---
Tbh in my opinion they should focus on game content that is not pvp related. This is a softcore RPG in the first place. PvP is an element of it I get this but what was huge let down for me was when  the devs said they focus on NW before they bring  new content for  the pve/exploring oriented playerbase. If someone wants to play capture the flag or something else there are great games out there that provide it like BF or any BR shooter. Even the new cod is one the 1st one that is „playable“ in ages.
---
But if they put it at a lower price, then wouldn't people who bought the original skin be mad that they paid extra for a reskin? I think that they should both be the same price, but 1800 is a bit much
---
One problem is how vast the damage scales are. One guy might do 10 times the damage (or more) of someone else.
---
It is a great point as it gives perspective and head cannon.
---
No one outside of Bethesda knows.
---
Sentinel and AP.
---
PSN is flyingpinkbadger. I'm on now. We can do the in game trade and just buy off each other if that works for you.
