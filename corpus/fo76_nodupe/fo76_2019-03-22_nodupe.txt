Survival mode should be a one time transfer or start a new character and neither should transfer back to Adventure mode. 
---

---
Let people survive in survival mode. They want to play it then pay the price to play instead of running away. 
---
---
---
Read some of the posts on the front page. 
---
Bethesda has come out and said that the rare masks are rare and that they will look into adjusting the drop rate of such items in the future. 
---
My God. Everybody needs to stop crying for nerds. Everything has a counter. These armor sets are vulnerable to the following:
---
1. Gamma guns
---
2. Radium Rifles
---
3. Bloodied weapons
---
4. Critical builds
---
Considering that they are the hardest armor set in the game to come by I dont see any reason to nerf them when they already have weaknesses. People just dont want to need a build I'm this community.
---
Yes please, well said, totally agree.
---
You're the hero we don't deserve :)
---
Yeah, I played Rust for a day and it was trash because all I could do was hope I respawn in a place that hadn't been built on because chances were they had guns and you didn't.
---
90% of the game was me respawning and getting the first little bit of resources to build about a wall. That 10% was me looking for a server that wasn't trash, stumbled upon a christian server with no one in it and the game was playable.
---
My apologies, I assumed that when you said that you wouldn’t play or recommend any future Bethesda titles that you had meant that you would stop playing 76 as well.  I misread that part.  If players experience bugs, that is unfortunate and Bethesda should be told about them to fix them and from what I’ve seen they’ve been working on fixing a lot.  If you are one of those players who experiences bugs constantly, that really sucks and I hope you can enjoy the rest of your time playing the game since you aren’t leaving 
---
To encourage group play
---
I'm not a robot. I'm batman.
---
jfc xD
---
omg so many ppl suck at video games
---
Not exactly survival mode if they can leave and go back to Adventure mode with same character. 
---
Also all duped weapons you know will transfer over... sue it should be a clean environment. 
---
40 yo here. I feel so out of place sometimes lol. I rarely talk and/or chat. I like to collect stuff, and then try and sell it. I'm boring. Lol.
---

Gt SkippyBoJangles
---
I wish I had a wife and played fallout at the same time...
---
Exactly!!
---
I have a dedicated min maxed bodied build I still can't punch through that garbage. Crit builds are useless against this because they all use stealth boys and you cats cloaked enemies. . Gamma guns work sure. If you can hit them. 
---
It is time for bethesda to stop shooting themselves in the foot. Let the majority rule on game features. 
---
You can go into your pip boy and reject the event
---
I'm on ps4, I can contact this user to see if it's legit
---
Thanks. I've also added a slightly different idea to a separate post: [www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3wcsp/survival\_the\_same\_characters\_but\_empty\_inventories/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3wcsp/survival_the_same_characters_but_empty_inventories/)
---
:D timing lines up with unbanned wave
---
god you don't close the door! 
---
How did they make you think that? Haha what a joke.
---
Sounds great
---
Lucky you ! I got the legendary aluminum today wanna trade ? 
---
You're either a troll, or a complete imbecile. I'd bet on both.
---
My proof is that myself, who has spent many hours in watoga has never experienced this. That's all you have as proof right? Your word that this happens? My word is that it doesn't.
---
But hey, I'll take it a step further. None of the 170k+ subscribers to this sub have ever shared their experience of it happening, in the 4 months the game has been out. 
---
What doesn't your pea-sized brain comprehend about the fact that, when you make a claim that has never before been stated or had evidence put forth in support of, you are the sole person who is required to generate proof?
---
I'd you don't, that's fine, but you will be seen as a liar and a troll and that doesn't bother me in the slightest.
---
Rare and only one confirmed image in two days of an event are completely different things. I think Bethesda doesn't realize there is some bug.
---
Sounds like a very cool idea! I would love to go online and find this bar. 
---
What was all that one in a million talk?
---
Go outside ?
---
Thanks for such a thorough response. That's not what I was thinking.
---
Tag one of the community managers I’ve tried with no luck 
---
You will soon find them for sale in the Atom store. That's why drop rates will not be increased.
---
So not going to fix the drop rate at all this makes a good first impression of a time limit even. Whats going to make other people participate in other events. I love this game I've never said anything bad about this game but reading this acually made me mad like what the heck. I mean I have gotten 75+ masks and doing it with another person neither of us have gotten one. Show fricken video proof Bethesda cuz so far I'm seeing pictures that can't be believed. God Damn
---
I share in your pain! 
---
You can target crouched players in VATS. You just have to learn the mechanics
---
Look for queen groups here or in the xbox looking for group page.
---
I think i did 7 queen runs earlier,  fastest was sub 5 minutes to loot.
---
Seems like there’s only toothy man for me
---
Gotta say, this is a pretty good compromise between both arguments!
---
Bless that mans kind soul 
---
I’ll check. I finished the even right before I had to go to class, I think I might have an extra
---
Ok, valid point. Sadly I don't think you'll get much visibility or buy in, but I'll upvote you. Cheers! 
---
Isnt there already pvp scaling? Low lvls do a lot to high lvls and vice versa?
---
Also they mentioned weapons will feel more powerful now, so im assuming there will be weapon scaling now too? 
---
What is this carebear shit. You should drop everything on death. 
---
Where’s is looking in to the future pose ?
---
This doesn't make sense. They're next to unattainable without godlike luck. Are you sure the droprate isn't bugged?
---
Yes?
---
Because this community is a bunch of entitled little whiny babies. Its hilarious scrolling these Faschnact comment sections. 
---
The problem is that it's no longer just in game currency being traded. One of the people who got the Old Man Winter mask was offered $50 PayPal for it. Yes it's against TOS, but it's still happening.
---
https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-fasnacht-parade-event-available/
---
read this overview of the event by a website.
---
&gt; Once the robots reach Old Man Winter, the parade will conclude, and you and your teammates will earn special event rewards. **These vary, but do include the various new parade masks. Certainly, there’s more rewards than you could earn in a single playthrough. As such, fans have plenty of reason to protect the parade a few different times**.
---
When you read that, do you honestly have the idea that 5/10 of the masks will be SO rare that after 2 days of the event there will be a SINGLE case of someone finding ONE of the 5 masks? I certainly don't. 
---
Very nice, my good sir, how many caps would you like for it?
---
Except this one. They should make the decision to implement this feature based on this reddit post. 
---
Not true. I have am assigns sentinel build with full health and armor perks. My buddy has a bloody death claw gauntlet build with unyeilding armor and he can 1 shot me easy.
---
Serendipity. 
---
People still get salty af about getting killed in their workshops. People on this subreddit get mad because they get PKed by people that don't even intend to farm the workshop's resources. 
---
I've never seen anything official about the reset time. I just hop on about the end (50) or the start (00) of an hour and it usually starts a little bit after. Latest I have seen it start is 15 after.
---
Given the popularity keeping the area loaded and different start times, I just assumed it was an hour after it ended. Otherwise it would always be at the start of the hour.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
but people are still arguing about how many masks are obtainable so different rest time theories aren't surprising.
---
I mean people farming for low level god tier legendaries just to exploit and play with lower levels, they're low level items but they'd still get the job done.
---
No.
---
1. Gamma guns... sure, except they aren’t hitscan weapons, which means they can be dodged, and when you switch over to a nonhitscan weapon, the player can stop moving again. 
---
2. Haha. Sure... 15 rads/shot isn’t exactly much, especially for someone with rad resistance. 
---
3. Bloodied builds... oh, you mean a build where you make yourself more vulnerable to be able to fight them? Doesn’t exactly sound like a counter to me.
---
4. Critical builds can’t target Stealth Boys. 
---
Really?  I mean if you're "dueling" them they can be a pain but if you just line of site them around a corner or anything that causes them to move/stagger you can quick vats one shot them.  They can't stealth/crouch or they don't get the sentinel bonus either.    
---
I would like to try the perk that applies rads on melee attacks and use a ripper, I've heard that works well (against anyone?) but  I haven't tried it myself.  
---
 "We’ve made some over-arching adjustments to PVP damage in Survival Mode to make weapons feel even more deadly in your hands, while also limiting the likelihood that another dweller can drop you in one hit "  
---
As for this, I'm not sure what they meant but it's possible there are some nerfs/buffs of some sort already, we really should wait and see before freaking out.  The reddit freaked out over the "duper ban" turned out nothing we predicted happend.  I PERSONALLY predict the POSITIVE that we will damage boosts capped at some point and damage mitigation capped at some point OR something like that, lower stats buffed up like in elder scrolls online cyrodiil.  Who knows though?  Why get mad over it before we know lol
---
Yea I looked at the map, after I spent about 20 mins working through the silo is when the death from above quest started. But you can’t finish the silo without them? Or they’re just to get to some of the good loot? 
---
I doubt that, but you can sure as hell be finding them on eBay soon for much more than they should be.
---
I've made 3 PvP characters in the current mode and 0 available character slots. If you want to keep the PvP players on the PvE servers, then we should follow through with your suggestion. If the PvE players want to lessen the overlap, then they should allow crossover.
---
I was a newb who’s camp was destroyed there. Only time. Once I learned why I got over it. 
---
What platform??
---
I would hope they don’t do that. Cause that bad mmkay...
---
I was also able to test this yesterday and today, and arrived at the same conclusion. More precisely, Biv's daily quests reset at 12:00 AM UTC (which would be 8:00 PM EDT).
---
remindme!
---
You know, it's not like the fanboys will be able to safe theyr asses on the long run. Fo76 didn't do as well as they expected it to do, even when they started giving it away for allmost free....it's been bad enough for them to forge numbers in fact. Noone who was talked into buying it will ever believe them anymore and we can expect a lot low quality games in the future.
---
I mean what they did in 76 wasn't even a good deal... that panic sale a week after the release has exposed them to bad propaganda with minor profit..
---
Let them be dude. They'll gonna reap what they sow eventually. The only ones loosing are them and beth as far as i'm concerned.
---
There are areas with lower level enemies that never scale with high level players though
---
If you want this, then invite them to your team. You're asking for features we mostly have in the current game mode. 
---
1. Gamma guns can do 125 rads per hit with deep dish mod
---
2. You are mad that you need skill to use a gamma gun because it can be dodged?
---
3. Bloodied builds can 1 shot so you never get the chance to fight back and they can use stealth boys
---
4. Stealth boys are entirely separate from the armor itself so that isn't a valid arguement. 
---
On PC thanks, I have toothy I'm missing the witch and goblin mask since the others don't drop.

Take a friend! I did it low level with one and also helped my friend low level
---
Get Gud?
---
Wow
---
But then wouldn’t other low levels have access to similar gear? I guess you could just make it so high levels can’t go into low level sessions?
---
Added
---
Why... why do this to us? 😫
---
Just to clarify, I’m currently in the responders but plan on leaving soon to be part of the enclave. 
---
I think some of the people responding about being prepared are right. I launched a nuke earlier tonight, people did come, and we lost. I had noticed a big group at fasnacht and hoped they would all show up. they did, several 100+'s and 60, 70, 80 etc.  We just didnt output enough damage.  I think finding those groups so everyone is prepared to lay waste is a good idea.
---
People literally get a warning when they take a workshop so they shouldn’t be salty at all! They were warned plain and simple.

---
That would be far worse than not getting one...
---
Every 10th or so post in this forum is about "Should I get Fallout76?", or "I stopped playing, should I come back?".   
---
While Fallout76 can be fun, by recommending it, we encourage Bethesda to make sub-par games.    
---
How can down-voting posts about "sub-standard products being bad" bring about better products in the future?
---
But then those low level with crazy gear can just go into servers and make it a bad playing experience people without gear. What I'm trying to get at is no matter if the game was level based, you'd still come across powerful players with crazy weapons. All in all: Level doesn't matter.
---
You might be right. I logged on this morning before work, got my quest at 5 am ET. Just logged on now to test your theory, at 8:10 ET I got a new quest from Biv.
---
Stealth Boy. Sneak around them. If you get discovered, hide in the elevator. The alternative is to ask someone that's higher level to escort you. Platform? If you're on Xbox I might be able to help later.
---
I’d say go Nerd Rage over Demo expert 3 but everything else is solid advice.
---
Is there even a way to track duped gear? Would you just purge everything that meets the requirements of a popular duped item? 
---
What about players who didn't know they were buying it from a duper and used a lot of ingame resources to purchase it? 
---
A mass purge might fix the problem but you'll upset any player, who wasn't aware they got their stuff from a duper or not. 
---
I have a two shot explosive gatling plasma, I got it by trading a bloodied three star dragon with extra aim damage, and lower weight. I got that drop legitimately, and as far as I know the other player got his legitimately as he told me as much but chances are though its probably duped. (Honestly I would trade it for any 3 star explosive gatling plasma with weight reduction, its not that gamebreaking, i got it post nerfs)
---
But if a purge like you suggest happens anytime in the future. Then its basically saying don't buy any good three stars from anyone ever until the purge cause they might be duped and you lose your resources. 
---
Honestly the only solution I see that might work with your purge is to make sure all the worst dupers and gone. And when you do purge possible duped legendaries then give everyone effected one legendary of their choice matching the stars are what you took away. (Max one 3 star item per account)  it ensures those who got a duped legendary by accident get something while the worst offenders who had tons of duped legendaries can only get some credit, massively setting them back.
---
But either way a purge is gonna cost you a good section if your player base.
---
I’ve tried asking around but no higher levels will go with me because it’s kind of a waste of their time but I appreciate the comment! I will continue to try to find help from higher up players if nothing else works
---
I love the separate inventories thing. Anything to mitigate gear and build advantage.
---
I haven’t tried that out yet but I will this time! Thanks!
---
That's an insanely large sample.
---
36 yo.  I share my xbox account with my 7 year old.  Very new to 76.
---
Xbox name is EvyAG
---
Nah, see, when I make unusual claims I back them up with proof, ‘cause I’m cool like that. Behavior like yours is immature and highly suspicious.
---
Maybe you aren’t trolling. But understand that the way you’re making claims and responding, it looks and sounds like a troll to pretty much everyone here. 
---
[removed]
---
I think I have two stealth boys so I can certainly try that out!
---
What system are you on?
---
I dunno man, I'm pretty sure if you do PvP anywhere, whether it's an intended PvP zone or out of build zones, you're just a griefer, duper, and a piece of shit. Probably a piece of shit in real life too. 
---
At least that's the impression I've gotten PvPing randos
---
Xbox one
---
You can be in all of the factions without repercussions on 76
---
I can make you some for 1 bullet per cap
---
Thank you I just spit up my drink. Wtf Rofl please tell me you did something
---
Nice!
---
Ah damn. Good luck!
---
I'm getting tired of doing this event already. I have 10 of each common mask, and all plans/recipes unlocked. Not only have I not seen a single rare mask on anyone, I no longer expect to get anything else.
---
I know everyone is frustrated about rare masks not dropping...but I just did the event twice on the same server, got a mask the first time and nothing but a plan the second time. Anyone else seeing this? If we're repeating the quest multiple times should we be switching worlds?
---
Fair
---
I did it just sneaking with my newest low level character, but a SB should make it easy if you know what to grab before you get to the elevator platform. 
---
Don't you dare complain or the fanboys will down-vote you.
---
Thank you my friend!
---
Scotch tape + red dot is a solid solution too!
---
No cameras or phones in my club. 
---
If I have to grind up a new character again I'm probably just going to stay in adventure mode and get my PvP by workshop takeover. Pretty sure the PvE crowd is better off if they let PvP players play the way they want.
---
If ur on xbox I'll give you a hand but wont be on for a couple of hours...level 190 here..if you want it
---
I rhink the real issue isnt so mich that people have high level gear, its that a huge proportion of that gear is duped, realistically how many people would you see with TSE weapons if it wasnt for the early dupes that spread then far and wide in the community, these are going to be transferred to PvP, so instead of may e 1 person per server having a TSE weapon, probably well over half the server will have them, which will make PvP a matter of who shoots first wins
---
Cool story?
---
I've run into him 3 times on thw road behind charleston fire department
---
I’ve watched a few videos on it so I know the locations of the equipment I need to get but the only problem is me actually being able to get them before death
---
1 in ~10k would be a unreasonable drop rate.
---
I had a legendary rolling pin that served me well in early games.
---
I'm hoping for snow storms to hurt vision at times, making flares, flare guns, chems, and positioning with lighting more valuable to spotting enemies against them.  Possibly there could even be a perk that has enemies which have headlamp light or flare light shine on them become visible through walls and snow for a short period.  
---
Apparently the chances are super low and hopefully they have stopped the duping cause the few who actually get one are gonna own the market
---
ha. no way, I'm way to lazy to cheat. not playing was relative, I did log on a few times and I think i even leveled once in jan.  I understand why people cheat but if its not hitting the enter button, typing moneybags, and getting a million simoleans-easy you can count me out.  
---
The concept of starting over for survival mode isn't an unfamiliar one- games like Diablo 3 have players start fresh every new season.. though their seasons do last 3 months, not 1 week. Also the characters can't bounce back and forth between modes- you only get to move back to adventure mode once the season is over.
---
If the survival mode times were longer than a week- then starting over each time would make a bit more sense.
---
Want an owl? Xbox
---
I haven't seen a single post about them. 
---
EST time here so I can’t really do it in a couple of hours but if you give me your gamer tag then I can get you when we’re both on!
---
I've noticed before that 'Syringer' seems to be considered a legendary item, at least if the legendary item wasn't there, often a syringer was.  Maybe 'exotic' weapons are considered legendary by the loot table, and they tried to clean that up but didn't do a good enough job?
---
Sure....egaman69
---
From what I’ve seen, many of those posts you mention are by people seeing how much better it’s gotten lately and want to ask for other players advice on if it’s really changed.  As for the downvoting, our votes on reddit don’t really correlate to anything when it comes to making a better product.  Anyway, it’s been fun but I’m off work now so I’m gonna head home and play Fallout now.  Maybe I’ll see you there.  Have a good day
---
This guy had the old man winter mask. [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/544158975617400842/558444846944092170/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/544158975617400842/558444846944092170/unknown.png)
---
Haha I kept dying falling down the cliffside and gave up.
---
THEY DONT EXPECT YOU TO GRIND THE EVENT ALL WEEK. OF COURSE THERE ARE LESS PEOPLE NOW. ITS BORING AFTER LIKE TEN TIMES. MOVE ON. ITS JUSY A FEW MASKS. GET A FUCKING LIFE. 
---
I'd like to nerf the drop rate of wooden armor.
---
Unless said wood is the same wood bridging holes on bridges and gaps of buildings. Any 2x6 that can hold me in my PA with 400lbs of scrap has got to be good wood.
---
In statistics, 30 is a decent size. 6k is insanely good.
---
Why the fuck would you want to grind it all week. It's meant to be done a few times and then move on. Not repeated thousands of times. What's wrong with you
---
I completely disagree with you. Even if you forced people to make a new character, in a few months you would have the exact same scenario you have now. You will never have a truly fair scenario  and that is part of the challenge of the game 
---
38 yo. level 35. GT: phinfan007
---
No lol I was wait like that because you have a strip club 
---
This is a pretty great idea to show accurate player feedback, just as long as they do it per account and not character. Also... voter fraud!! Lol jk
---
Yeah but thats in theory, in practice claiminf a workshop from another player auto makes you both enemies strait away no matter where you are, this is used to just randomly kill people with workshops
---
Will do. ign: gilpo
---
Had a three star legendary insult bot show up in the mire, can't complain about a free max level three star. 
---
Not areas per se but rather specific locations that don't switch enemies. If there free location surrounding them then that doesn't exactly change the fact that you won't be able to level there.
---
Shit doesn't even despawn until the crown is killed so you can't even judge by the map or even players in the lobby. Leveling feels like walking in a goddarn minefield in this game.
---
Thanks!
---
Yes how many times have I thought hrm, I don't seem to be doing the damage I should... ARG still got my crafting cards!  Now.. which ones did I swap out? uuhhhhhhh
---
This would be great but wouldn't it break immersion in game? I feel like it'd be easier to put into their website
---
Let me know if the other trade falls through. I have a spare.
---
Ah, I'm high strength and wearing excavator with calibrated shocks. Combined with all of the weight reduction cards.
---
I just wasn't aware I had that much food on me at the time.
---
Stop complaining about people complaining. 
---
So you make a post complaining about the complainers and in that post you shit on their opinions but only offer your own opinions. 
---
Posts like this are just as annoying
---
This seems like a great way for me to donate 15 stimpacks to a misanthropic nerd with nothing better to do than stalk me for 5 minutes before one-shotting me with an explosive shotgun.
---
I don’t think legendary weapon or armor should be in survival at all
---
Hey guys, this guy took a workshop 4 hours ago because the daily challenge said to claim a workshop, this means i have the right to kill him and his team in the enclave bunker while their using a terminal right?
---
Yeah this is what I was referring to 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2zu7a/z/eiwhjoh
---
ok cool
---
I like the game and I know you will hate me for this, but they deserved the shit they got. The game was a cash grab when it launched. I had an unplayable experience during the beta and quit until now. I'm finally starting to enjoy it. They still lack the most basic features of an mmo, but they will get there... hopefully. A Grand Exchange, a safe town, and a far bigger player count are much needed additions imo.
---
Same man. I've only seen pictures of some of them and it's hard to tell if they're from the Dev room or legit from drops. 
---
nah man, the forest has pretty low enemies and the events are always low level they never scale to other high level players. Like, never. I'm level 170+ and never find any high levels in forest area. Just go to areas and events that suite your level and you should be fine
---
Regardless, there would still be a hell of a lot people in all systems running around with the cooler masks. I know I would and I've been grinding the crap outta this
---
They don't have collective evidence across all consoles. In reality I'm sure the figures are better. Even if they aren't i personally think ultra rare cosmetics are good for games.
---
I disagree with the mentality everyone should be able to earn everything. It takes away the feeling of you getting something special when you rarely do. 
---
That said i see the other perspective as well and agree it is frustrating.
---
I won’t even be able to check for it until tomorrow afternoon, if I have it I’ll let you know
---
34.5...to be exact.
---
Dropped my stqsh of various minds around his prooerty. Not sure if it worked, but i did get a bounty randomly later while doing my sales route.
---
level scaling to 50. It ain't rocket science. I know it can be hard to get right, but it's way better than the hundreds of flaws introduced by allowing mode switching.
---
The far greater and overwhelmingly majority of PvP seem to be bored players targeting lower levels in most cases half their levels. 
---
Pacifist mode should be re-named No PvP mode. If a player has it turned they can’t be killed or there stuff harmed. 
---
There’s a lot of players who enjoy doing quests and scouting the wasteland alone or together helping other players and I think that’s great! 
---
If people want to PvP then transfer over to survival mode and start a new character actually surviving with no chance of duped weapons. 
---
I should have put more effort and details when I said this last [month](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/app7fx/idea_make_pvp_realms_into_battlegrounds/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I'm going to go create some wormhole I can travel into that leads to a universe that has pc and ps4 servers. Be right back.
---
To clarify what the other guy said, it's &lt;.01% chance per run. If a person does 504 runs, they have a 14% chance to have gotten 1 rare mask after all of those runs.
---
Brand new characters and NO legendaries!
---
Because we want to obtain all the masks. That's the whole point of the event. What's the point of adding collectables and not collect them? 
---
It was when it launched. Literally unplayable from my experience. I know other people had a decent time, but my experience was horrible on beta and launch day
---
I agree this could work, thanks for trying to find compromises between the two arguments. Lets face it the fanbase isn't super big and bad press and really hurt the game, we need to cooperate and coexist not sever the fanbase more.
---
I like that idea lol
---
No wonder, one day I got two quests back to back like an hour later and thought it was a bug, mustve been at 8pm
---
Good luck! :)
---
That actually seems really likely. 
---
"Lady Mormont speaks harshly... and truly". This is the truth. 
---
I suppose they could make a "hardcore" survival mode that has no crossover with the adventure mode servers as well to cover both bases. Not sure if this has been suggested.
---
downvoting all this shit.
---
Yet again, you're trying to force the way people play. No one is stopping you from making a new character for survival. You're trying to stop people from using existing characters in survival. You're the one who is trying to limit options. 
---
I don't see how you can be this dense.
---
And yet your raging over how other people spend their time, people are actually playing and enjoying the event..... that is clearly not working as intended. Stay classy.
---
I got a beaver 
---
What masks? 
---
I’ve only ever been wanted twice. Once, for unlocking a container in an owned workshop back in the early days before it was well known that that is a “no-no”. The second time, I was unloading on some bots in Watoga with my .50, and I guess I was unlucky enough to hit someone’s camp out in the bog because I got hit with a twenty cap bounty. 
---
Same here. I destroyed shit and did what they wanted me to do. Played on my second account for a while, came back and BOOM! Banned. How. Fucking how. 
---
What is it with the germans and burning people
---
Which one are you looking for? I think I have duplicates of a few
---
I leave Stims, .38 ammo and Bobby pins on the dead body once a login. 
---
I’m starting to think it’s due to my build, but I can absolutely be killed easily in pacifist mode. As recently as a week ago I was one shot by an explosive gun at an event, and a day or two before that I was almost punched to death by a power fist, I had to heal multiple times in the the 1-2 minutes he was hitting me. If someone kills me at a train station because I’m afk for 2 minutes and start losing hundreds of caps, that seems like a problem. One I’m glad they are fixing!
---
I don't think you understand how statistical probability works especially when it's involved in random drop chances. The drop chance does not increase with each additional run. Each run of the event has a chance to yield a rare or uncommon and it's the same chance every time. You can theoretically run it 10k times and still not get it if the rng doesn't pick the number
---
I’ve been there plenty but never seen liberators on the course. I’ve seen them a while off but not in the actual building or on the golf course. Don’t know what to tell ya
---
It would definitely have to be per user.   
---
Fair enough.
---
If you're on Xbox, I can probably help later. My main character hunts deathclaws for sport. 
---
Hey man, just trying to paint this event in a different light. What is a discussion if not people sharing their opinions? I believe people are making a big deal out of this little event which was supposed to being people together. So I made a post about it. Sorry I annoyed you in the process, it was not my intention. 
---
Haha, the rare ones like the skull one whit the hat, the jester, yellow bee one 
---
I would agree if the fuss was over1-2 masks that were super rare, but the issue is that half of them are absurdly rare.
---
Your doing the same thing, limiting people to playing with duped gear and ruining any point of leaderboards on survival. And in doing so you'll ruin a game mode that otherwise stood a chance of bringing back some of the player base instead it will be a cesspool of assassin's sentinel geared dupers farming legit players.
---
 Your comment really only is a response to 1 percent of my original post. 
---
I've seen multiple players (usually high levels that want to ruin the game for new comers) that get all the resources and hoard them so that the parade can't start
---
Sorry, dont get the reference bud. GoT?
---
Oh lol no, if I had those three id fetch in like 50k lmaoo
---
Thanks my friend! I can’t do it now but if you give me your gamer tag, I’ll be sure to message you! 
---
I accidentally shot a turret because I thought it was hostile, but it was someone's camp. I was extremely low level and it put me off to the game for months lol. 
---
Better than farming nerfed Whitesprings Golf Resort when it's nuked. Nothing but junk there any more.
---
Yeah after you settle on a build you start accruing points without paying attention.  Yeah i would use one of those perk loadout testers online and see what you'd like to do, and post here for feedback on a builds
---
I got a 10 cap bounty for picking up a combination wrench somebody had at their workshop which I didn't know was claimed. I just stripped off my armor and waited for the inevitable. 
---
Okay, thanks a lot man
---
no
---
You wanna show me a picture of that I have never seen any of the passive animals tamed cept for a cat
---
Good for you! Once you launch nuke, that’s when you know that you’ve accomplished something!
---
Indeed I do. 
---
The problem is to get a true result, they have to do it within the game, either in the game itself, or from the main menu. There is a Large part of the fan base that does not read or visit the website, reddit, or Twitter. Especially among console gamers. 
---
And I have a mirelurk king 
---
Check roadmap and trailer video
---
Oh I know. I can buy when there’s a supply 
---
There’s not much reason not to take it, even if you just leave it unequipped until you need it.
---
Haven’t found anyone yet though 
---
Thanks for the help guys, I fuck those things out the sky now like they’re children and I’m Michael Jackson. Shamone
---
Awesome and much appreciated. I’ll def take you up on your offer. When are you usually on? 
---
Oh ok well melee is a tier of it's own in terms of broken. My build is more rifles. Melee tears through anything. Lol
---
I dont know how to insert images in new to this app.
---
Hell yeah, you probably have more extra points than you know what to do with, but yes totally worth it. I guess you never unlocked the quantum stash at the Nukacola plant on the roof.
---
I guess, I still just don't see what the big deal is. Maybe I'm not as emotionally invested in this game as others
---
 
---
Didnt know redskull made it to the fallout universe
---
Go southwest.  Mole miners give you gauntlets that do 100
---
Usually see a couple morph every 15 to 20 minutes, but if you jump servers you can find plenty more. I usually do a couple laps around the entire city, if it becomes a drought just jump server.
---
&gt;I'm really not trying to lick anyone's balls here
---
In which case I shall find another post
---
&gt;The far greater and overwhelmingly majority of PvP seem to be bored players targeting lower levels in most cases half their levels.
---
I don't think so. You get 17 caps from killing a level 17 character. You get 297 caps from killing a level 297. Those are the characters most the PvP crowd wants to kill. 
---
&gt;Pacifist mode should be re-named No PvP mode. If a player has it turned they can’t be killed or there stuff harmed.
---
What's stopping trolls from claiming every workshop on the map just to deny other players? Further, I'm not sure if this solution works out for people with turret farms like the kind behind whitesprings. These people are now unstoppable. 
---
&gt;If people want to PvP then transfer over to survival mode and start a new character actually surviving with no chance of duped weapons.
---
If that happens I'm just going to stay in adventure mode and get my PvP in by workshop conquest. I have 3 PvP characters and 0 free character slots. The upside of survival mode for PvE players is it will get the PvP players out of their co-op experience so they can get more of that play style. If you constrain the PvP crowd's play options, then they're just going to kill you for your workshops. I know I will
---
I didn't disagree with 99% of your post. I was just addressing a purge of all probable duped legendaries is a bad idea, and unfairly punishes players who played legitimately and had bad luck to aquire the wrong item.
---
I'd really love to get some dev feedback on what they were thinking with that drop rate. Honest to god. Did they want to make some kind of golden ticket that could be traded for anything in the game with other players or something? Extend the life of the game because (assuming they stay dupe free) no single player will ever be likely to aquire for a full set in their lifetime? Like... There's gotta be a reason. I would love to hear it. 
---
If you do the event non stop for a week, don't sleep, never take breaks, server hop and are in a parade 24/7, and i don't do the event at all, Your chance of getting even one mask looks like it's less than 1% more probable than mine. Like.... What? That's working as indended? I need to know the intention. 
---
but you wouldnt be locked in
---
Wait does Sentinels not work when crouched??
---
No I'm talking  about the guy with the beaver
---
Yup, this is indeed a speech worthy of a mormont... AND IT NEEDS TO BE SAID. Bethesda have clearly intended this to be an inspiration to the trade community after all the duping scandal and I for one am going to enjoy finding my first rare mask. 
---
Believe what you will.
---
M-f 4pm central time. Weekends most of the day.  
---
My farts are always fresh,  my body however is old.
---
You’re complaint isn’t what bothers me, it’s the fact that all you do is complain, you offer no solutions at all instead you just trash a product that many people are enjoying I’d bet more people then not enjoy the game. No one is arguing that it had a rocky launch but almost every single online game that I have ever played has had bugs and crashes it comes with the product.  Hell RDR2 is quite possibly going to be game of the year and is also one of the best single player games I have ever played and it was chalk full of bugs.  So either get over it and continue to play or give it up and stop complaining about it. 
---
I have not. I almost exclusively drink nuka products cuz I’m a soda addict irl lol having a somewhat consistent stash would be nice 
---
What do you mean “use workshop PvP to hunt people” ? Can you be engaged in PvP due to owning a workshop even if you’re across the map? 
---
I don’t know about you, but I do greatly enjoy having a machine craft ammunition for me. Pay a few caps, plop down some power, and you become a god. No steel, lead, plastic, or gunpowder. As long as you hold that factory, you’ll be getting all the ammo you’ve ever wanted. That’s way better than using the workbench. Especially with how much a SBQ can chew though 5.56 
---
But you can't charge them extra money for moving their characters then.
---
Yes, it's the important point too, thanks for comment!
---
How much are you paying for plans?
---
DM me I'm interested. I have a lvl 7 I'm working on.
---
That looks great! Love the dining room table idea
---
If you run out of caps in pvp you have 3 hours penalty to your dmg
---
Depends on which one
---
What ya got?
---
Really? Does it make a difference whether 1 or 3 level 20's have to fight like 4 lv68 scorchbeasts?
---
If anything, it encourages beeing pulled, what's the kind of braindead gameplay that's even worse then solo play.
---
That's quite incorrect. People would be fine if everybody had been playing honestly. This isn't a out time put in, or loyalty (why would you ever describe yourself as loyal to a corporation?). 
---
Cool, you've played 800 hours and earned every tse you have and you wanna go bust heads in survival, but for everyone one of you there are 10 dupers or innocents in dupes clothing. 
---
Not a single person I know acquired a TSE weapon from any quest or killing any enemy.  Every single one of them traded for them and admits to knowing that it's duped. Sorry. I don't have any sympathy for those who benefit from cheating, whether it be directly or indirectly. 
---
Matter of opinion. I get where you are coming from, i partly agree.
---
Do i think its worth public outrage? Not even a little.
---
Do i think they should patch it next year when the event come back around? Yeah, a small increase after the first year would be cool.
---
Yourself included
---
Holy shit. This is LITERALLY the only reason I quit playing since around the game came out. I just wanted open fucking PVP.
---
Will come back. Got two level 50 characters to murder with.
---
You're a child, it's okay... Nobody is forcing you to do a thing. Just go away and let the adults here having our grown up conversations. You don't have to believe anything, bye bye sweetie!
---
AaronCarr
---
The duped weapons sell for over 1k caps, so that probably wouldn't work. Some weapons go for 5k caps too.
---
Your reply has a much different tone than your post
---
"I implore you to take a step back ...right off a cliff and shut your fuckin mouth." Not sounding like you care much about listening 
---
Ive had this happen a lot, also sometimes ill go to my regular farm spots containers wont have any items in any of them even though i didnt play for 3+ days
---
I second this.
---
Said terminal, however you need to join BOS first. It's one of few the main quests this game has, and involves several subquests around the map.
---
So in all likehood a level 14 doesn't get them. Unless you spesifically go do the quests, in which case google will tell you all about it.
---
Also it's not a separate weapon per se. It's just 308 hunting rifle fully modded.
---
This is so nice, just ate a stranger with 5caps bounty after Fasnacht in the middle of the crowd. Completely naked and with moonshine mama mask. Thanks to you.
---
&gt;Why would the Brotherhood of Steel go around recruiting random Civilians.
---
Taggerdy is dead so she ain't the one making calls anymore.
---
**Collecting** is a large part of why I enjoy FO and ES games. It's a few days of spending time hopping and running a limited time event. I'm also trying to get the damn Forest Camo, so am running events in the Forest at the same time.
---
**Whitesprings** is meant to be done a few times and then move on. Not repeated thousands of times.
---
**The SBQ fight** is meant to be done a few times and then move on. Not repeated thousands of times
---
Go play the game the way you want, and don't be a dick to people who don't.
---
Looks awesome. Will be awesome when we can actually have a shop
---
Try power armor.
---
So what do you think would be a good solution then? Put an opt-in deal to transfer your character to survival one time with no moving that character back? 
---
I try looking at all the issues and unfortunately there’s a lot. 
---
If people want to PvP great! They’ll literally have a whole server to farm materials and PvP in! 
---
Knowing they can’t transfer back will make the pvE crowd happy. 
---
Not sure everyone will be happy either way! 
---
It just makes me smile how ignorant you are. 
---
Oh my god... this thread just keeps on getting better and better!
---
Yeah it's not bad idea. Well modded .308 is pretty handy, used mine maybe little above level 60, along with fully modded silenced pump action, until each was gradually replaced by legendaries, first medicore likes instigating and furious, then TS. Odd how much explosive weapons I'm finding now, compared to when I was lower level. Or maybe Im just more hunting legendaries and particularly multi star.
---
I did have level 25 TS handmade from about level 40 but I rarely used it, it was my in case of emergency because around the time I got it, it was super effective againts anything else I had. Funny how I initially even tried to sell it because I felt I don't need so powerful gun yet, and for fairly cheap too.
---
Remember though not all low levels are new. 
---
On my level 35 second char I've had explosive revolvers for quite long time, as well as I'm speccing slowly into melee knowing how powerful it is,  unlike many real new players, plus it's doable unlike with my high level main specced right into very different things. Quite a surprise though, I had level 20 western, and level 35 .44,(both explosive with .44 being also nicely weightless) and as I finally levelled enough to use the .44, I found it's weaker than Western with same mods. Even though Western is one or two steps lower level.
---
I was really expecting different, as the .44 is modern well machined gun made from modern materials, not some hand crafted thing made with few decades ago. But I guess it's consistent how any rifle has inferior range and damage, to the miniaturized artillery cannon known as black powder rifle. Somewhat surprised how single action revolver isn't even more superior in damage since it's already weak in DSP.
---
Maybe Bethesda just rolled a dice when deciding what gun is good what is bad, what is medicore.
---
What system?
---
Good talk. 
---
They would be the hardest to get in the game, **if** they weren't also the most heavily duped armor set in the game.
---
Yeah recently I had a player follow me around chucking molotovs at me as I was working on my house. Barely doing anything to me but was annoying. Thankfully I play with friends at way higher levels than me and they hammered him out of existence.
---
I lost over 40 karma when I started a discussion to make Fallout76 better, so good luck.
---
And they wouldn’t be able to take them if they started a new character OR do a one time transfer of character to Survival mode with no coming back. 
---
Yeah playing it a few times, not day in, day out all week man. Suck  a dick, San Diego!
---
Haha it's an online game dude
---
PS4
---
You're both batshit and deserve a beer
---
Give me riot signs with rainbows or I riot
---
I would agree with you if they haven't started needing in the first place. It is unbalanced to nerf the TSE guns because you don't want people being one shotted, only to let them get one shotted now by the death claw crowd because they can't be killed before one shotting you. Either need nothing or need everything.
---
Yes, please
---
This right here. The whole point of a survival mode is to make it a fight for your life, dig yourself out of the hole you start in, scenario. Allowing people to take their level 200+ characters with God tier legendary armor and weapons just means you'll have a bunch of people running around ruling the land and killing anyone who actually tries to play it from the start with a fresh character. 
---
So collect some and trade for the rest. It is not meant for every player to end the even with every item. 
---
Good to know! Thank you.
---
good to know thx! 
---
I second this too.
---
That's coming later than the no slap damage to players.
---
Also I'm really curious how people bent againts turret camps in WS haven't done the 1+1 heh. 
---
(shhh don't tell anyone, let them figure it out and then the threads will come in numbers)
---
Sounds like a legit strategy, maybe a flash sale later for some buffer time
---
I’ve had the issue where I can’t search cap stashes even with cap collector equipped, only since the last patch 
---
It’s only a suggestion... if people want to vent great but offering solutions other than mine that will or could work is a way better one. 
---
We all play the same game... how do we make it better? 
---
Simple, listen to those that play and hear their suggestions. 
---
My ideas are just that, ideas. I don’t make decisions! Haha! 
---
I found one of the courses had them. It could be they placed them there to offset all the people that camp ghouls
---
I agree, that's been my experience as well.
---
Was a joke. Hah, yeah.Congrats!  It'll be awhile for me to do that. Play solo, low hours,to chill wayy to slow :) From what I've seen- some grind to get there to launch it :)
---
I've encountered this a few times after I spawned into whitesprings in the aftermath of a nuke being dropped. When there are still glowing ones and nuked flora but the radiation has dissipated. I've seen liberators, protectrons, and eyebots. They are always low level and often diseased. The first time was with eyebots and almost all of them were legendary and all were low level. The time with the protectrons, they were all carrying 10-15 steel scraps but when I tried to loot them I would only get one or two. 
---
I understand the intent is people want to hit the reset button on dupes, but this isn't the way. Further, there are still duping exploits available. This will probably persist and it's probably better Bethesda does more on the ban side to eliminate duping rather than put more conditions on how the whole player base experiences the game.
---
I would be fine with a one-time crossover
---
Hahaha yup I don't quite get why I should care about masks anyway, I'll care when they give me a damage bonus xD
---
Probably because you looted them already in the last 20~ hours? From my experience they're on the same timer as loot, vendors etc
---
Mirelurk king currently, had Deathclaw, almost had Yao Guai.
---
I found if that happens to move a bit away, like to the other side of town, then come back and the option to search will show.
---
So the innocent should be punished for the guilty? 
---
I'm super interested in this, I just gotta make sure I have the materials. Is this a limited time thing? I haven't gotten much for flux as I've done maybe 3 nuke zones and might need to farm first which I'll happily server hop to get more, but would like to grab some serums for myself as well as for my friend who just got the game(for when he can get starched genes).
---
Also, just wanted to say this is a really awesome thing of you to do for everyone and thank you in advance :D
---
Pacifist mode - agreed, their experiment with that is a failure imho.  Go full steam ahead with the pvp servers, switch it off in adventure mode.  It's what everyone wants (except people who get their kicks out of making other people miserable)
---
I'm already happy. So nah
---
Welcome to the grind my friend, where the RNG gods are fickle and cruel
---
I just hid at the entrance and slowly picked then off

---
Eh I hate the way I sound. I heard myself on a voicemail once and I hate how redneck my voice is. Plus I'm 35 and I sound like I'm barely 20.
---
So nerf everything in the game because they have been duped before? Full sentinel assassins osnstill extremely rare.
---
What level are you?
---
We had a kid this morning that was making racial slurs and other inappropriate language during the event.  Couldn’t wait for it to be over to start taking pop shots at him.  Not on the same level as what’s being talked about here, but still annoying.
---
Someone also tossed a mini nuke up in the air at the bonfire just as the event was ending.  It was funny but also a dick move...at least it didn’t affect the event.  Probably the same kid.
---
All it takes is for one person to screw around and you lose your chance for a mask.
---
All the good stuff is locked behind level 3 if you can call it that.
---
Cool thanks for the tip, I’ll give it a shot next time. 
---
Fair point. though it might be tought to do.
---
So that inherently means that if an even its available for a week it must be grinded without break endlessly? 
---
The Bethesda dev who made it so that tamed creature killing doesn’t give a bounty.
---
Yep. That part of the game really needs to be improved, it's large part of game that so few do because of the stupid mechanics.
---
Don't buy plans from vendors, claim workshops and do events or trade with other players, they can be quite pricey and you'll need your caps for end game weapons and armor
---
I think we are built in the same area. 
---
MINUS the fact that weapons which should have a 0.000001% drop rate are prolific thanks to the rampant duping and Bethesda's lackadaisical response to it.
---
I did offer a solution in the original post.  You seemed to have missed it.   
---
Complaining about bugs is trashing the game?  You can bet all you want, but you are just guessing.  Also, because some people enjoy it that invalidates the arguments of those who have issues?  
---
Some bugs are expected when an online game launches.  But Bethesda is a large game company and should have had a lot less bugs on launch.  Oh, and there are still a lot of bugs STILL.  
---
So, according to you, I should accept sub-par products and not complain, OR just throw the game in the trash and also not complain?  In this view of yours, how do better products get made, then?
---
I honestly was surprised that there wasn’t a weight limit in the beginning! Fact that someone could weigh in at over 10,000 pounds (or I heard a rumor of over 100,000pounds or more) is crazy! 
---
It would have severely limited quantity of duped items! 
---
I might have a few lvl 20 30 items. I'll have to check. I can make handmades lvl 15 or 20 and combat shotguns or rifles lvl 20.
---
What's the point of survival then? There's no real commitment to it if you can hop back to easy mode on a whim.
---
silver handmade? how
---
That's fine and fair. My tone didn't open it up for discussion. It was more of a rant. 
---
Love the mirelurk he just looks BA
---
Either buy it from the reddit sub, goes for around 50c a piece or collect it at nuke zones and make it, you need 4 ingredients and 10 of raw crimson to make 1.
---
The dumpsters behind the whitesprings. Right next to the enclave bunker service entrance will net you some raw crimson.
---
I’m about done for tonight but will be back on tomorrow most of the day. Let me know what you need. I can probably make it due to the kindness of others. At the very least I can tell you what I’ll need. 
---
A healthy option to this:
---
Survival mode Must be started with a new character. No ties to any other. Once that character reaches the of the others hen the other can join survival. And they too are subjected to the lies of that. 
---
It’s not like we are asking for the world we just want a fair battle. 
---
Truth is the game was rigged from the start. 
---
The minute the dupers and cheaters came in the cap became moot. So what the items are all but gone. The damage is the fact that people used that system to amass caps and with that gain gear that made them the monsters they are now.  (Your all beautiful) just making a point.  
---
i did multiples on the same server for 2 days. just did other events between. i do have most of the stuff, all the common masks , missing 2 camp things. not a lot of repeating really. 2 or 3 of each mask before the harder to get ones. but never saw a special in 30 or so runs
---
Exactly! Especially when you have reactive plates that cause damage and now you’re wanted or have to fight due to someone slapping you...
---
I have a full set of sentinel assassin BOS armor and I get killed all the time.
---
I want more variety in unarmed weapons. Like an Old Man Winter mitt that freezes enemies or something. 
---
I wish I had known how bad a product Fallout76 was when it launched.  I would have waited a year or two for Bethesda to finally fix things.
---
That's unavoidable. People will always do that. I do not find that to be a valid reason not to make rare items. That's a symptom of not having bind on equip items and free trade, nothing more.
---
It sucks, but literally every game has some form of this down to account selling.
---
Or maybe have skins. The flamer could be a big bee!
---
Yup, I have done this
---
While that makes sense, they wouldn't fight, similar to the protections. Just having 8 robots and a mr handy leader just seems really minuscule (unless you have the whole server there of course)
---
I'm disconnecting so frequently that I can't even play the game.
---
There's a reason. Different perspective of fun.
---
Yea if it turns out only min-maxed builds are there and I get killed every 10 minutes then no.
---
If it's only half the players, or once an hour bring it on.
---
To me personally, that's the way the game is meant to be played. You can see another player as a very advanced AI.
---
It brings fear, carefulness , excitement, and tactics into the game.
---
I'm a pve player and will also be mostly pve in that mode and try to talk things through, but actually having to be tactical and having things to be careful about and risks involved, is just more fun to me than "hurr run and gun"
---
(I'm not judging people who like peace and calmth, but adventure mode for me just turns into run right into the enemy, any tactic works anyway) 
---
Hard to trade for the rare masks when no one else has them.
---
I can’t upvote this enough
---
Edited original post to reflect this. I apologise 
---
I think you're really downplaying the exploit aspect which is a huge part for me. I don't mind facing some high level players with gear better than mine, but I would really rather not face players that got to reap the benefits of exploits for a couple months (before we saw any major action from Bethesda). Fortunately today exploiting is much harder and much less of an issue, but there are still tons of people with very good equipment from the days when exploiting was possible. 
---
It isn't a fresh start isn't from higher level players, but from players that used exploits to become very OP. This game had a huge exploiting problem and although Bethesda has gotten rid of the source (for the most part), the actual duped items are still everywhere. I think the new PvP mode not having that would lead to a much healthier scenario.
---
This also ignores the whole other side which is the benefits of just game mode hopping to farm.
---
I see a bunch of players excited about survival mode but I can guarantee more than half will be running back to Adventure mode quickly! 
---
Exactly how is stuck under the floor even a thing in a modern game.
---
Current system does favour ganks too much. It really should just make it so you can claim the shop like usual, but if the owner isn't in the same cell as the workshop then he can't be PK'd. I would say 'if they're not in the claim zone' but you can get cheeky shitters who abuse the boundaries of the claim zone for immunity while still being able to contest the WS.
---
No i think they have valid points but gamers today are indeed more entitled, but that's because games now are designed today that if you pay or play enough usually you can get whatever you want.
---
I still don't have my headless horseman mount after ten years. Kids don't even come close to knowing my pain. This is nothing.
---
public outrage, no I agree. But it's worth mentioning to them that it takes away from the event when half of the rewards are essentially impossible to get.
---
... if you actually number yours in the order of my points that you’re responding to, like I did to your first list, I’ll address it. As it is you’re out of order/not even reading what I wrote.
---
After everything that's happened with FO76, the seemingly endless duping etc etc etc. What this game really needs is a fresh start, and survival should be that. It should give people like me a reaon to hop back into the game.
---
&gt;I think that the INITITATION of PvP should be confined to it. It's exploitable otherwise. To wit: Someone contests your workshop, but you're not inside the area, but just outside it. You sneak just inside, take your shot, then sneak right back out. Now they can't fire back at you.
---
It's all about range. Have the workshop PvP area larger than workshop build area. If you are way out elsewhere, either as contester or owner of workshop, normal PvP rules apply, requiring slap and response to have full damage.
---
If you are close enough, workshop PvP is full on. If the range is few times render range, it's sufficient. Then only few special things need to be addressed, like artillery.
---
That way the fighting can happen in surrounding area, allowing all kinds of tactics possibly, while staying well outside, will mean you won't even try to take or defend the workshop.
---
Sure, everyone could buy a TSE. If by “everyone” you mean the small amount of players who are aware of/bother posting on the market subreddits and discords. Duping was never a fair or good thing. 
---
And in the next couple weeks we will have the legendary vendor, so everyone (not just reddit users) will have access to great weapons. 
---
I can confirm this works, just run about 30 feet away and back, doesn't have to be too far
---
Why do people care. And how is this sub even still alive. This game is a pile of hot garbage. Give it up guys and play another game.
---
Couldn't agree more. Plus it's fun starting fresh. In my opinion
---
Hopefully not tooo close. I'm south of alphas missile silo, cliffside on the other side of the gap. Its extremely rare i can't place camp.
---
It doesnt seem fair at all I agree. 
---
&gt;No hunting them down across the map. It's obvious they don't care to hold it.
---
Yep :(
---
I addressed everything you said just not in the same order. That's petty 
---
I agree. Some people are reacting too strongly, but if you think its not fair i agree "you" should say something.
---
I'm 68 and I thought that I was the only old guy.. what a relief..lol see ya in the wasteland..
---
Maybe they're just a casual player who has no idea it's a rare drop.
---
Honestly would make them good money, but also soooooooooo much backlash.
---
Yeah I have everything and plenty of duplicates. I’m already growing very tired of doing it over and over like at least one drop of the jester would be very nice. I’ve done this even like atleast 50 times 
---
I miss my Deathclaw though.
---
I will quest in survival. I'm sorry I apparently only have half a brain. Jeez.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
Not even a high level yet, but I felt this game lacked any kind of combat depth. I want to be weary and scared in a wasteland, that's immersive to me. I explained it in another post, I don't even care about pvp itself or instigating it. I just want some risk. 
---
Agreed. Maybe limit it to 2 or 3 slots?
---
I Guarantee that. Worst part is it’s all going to be just like it is now. Nothing will change. 
---
truthfully, in a perfect world in my mind, i wouldnt let people transfer characters and id keep legendary rolls out of survival. keep everyone on a level playing field,  i dont want it to be luck that decides if i or someone else gets a god tier weapon that at the end of the day someone else may never end up finding. mod the base qeapons to work best for you, build your perks to make them better, etc. but dont start giving people TSE and all the other rolls in survival
---
I've never even seen pictures of the jester in the wild. 
---
Yeesssss 
---
Yeah, I’m not religious, I don’t operate on belief, I operate on proof. I’ll even try and prove it myself if it seems like there’s something there worth investigating, like I did with my investigation into slap damage claims. 
---
They work with one-handed perks, increase their damage with strength, have a mod that adds bleed and a chunk of damage, and can be over-repaired to increase their damage. With the right build, this amounts to over a third of the SBQ's health every time she lands.

I did it around level 30. It's out of range of the deathclaws, so anyone could do it if they wanted. I takes a little bit since they will hide from you if they can't hit you, usually just out if sight. I just snuck forward, fired a couple shots, then retreated to safety. 
---
What usually kills you?
---
Which perks do you need equipped to tame?
---
If you're fighting level 68 scorched beasts then its self inflicted. Go back to your area lol. Theres next to no scorched beasts where you should be at 20 and certainly not the swarms i hunt. Nothing makes me happier than a 1v3 lvl 80 scorched beast fight.

I just saw it as I was trying to get the rare Responder bot vendor to spawn. I walked across the bridge south of Charleston Station, turned back, and there was the eyebot, playing flute music, and being followed by five rats.
---
I think a lot of the reviews went past bugs. I'm not sure who you are watching, but most of what I saw did the same hypothetical "if it was bug free right now it would be..." I think a big reason the bugs got so much attention was simply because it was hard to miss them. On launch this game had so many freaking bugs and I think for a lot of people those left a bigger impact than the fundamental game issues. Fortunately today we see many of those bugs gone and now the other issues have gotten more attention (and fixes). 
---
I see your side of things in making genuine critiques of the game, but I also see the perspective of people being unable to get past the "bugginess". Even if that was over-exaggerated I think to an extent it was an issue with this game on launch that alone led to people quitting on it. 
---
Let's say you did nothing but run this event since it started. No sleep, no food, no craps on the toilet. You can run run the event in about 20 minutes. You then jump server and run it again. You are the luckiest person in fo76 because every server jump nets you an event to start. If all of this is correct. You could run 162 events. If you ran 162 events AND the rare hats had a 0.03% chance of dropping, you would have a 5% chance of having received 1 rare hat.
---
I usually stop by to grab the one at white springs and yeah sometimes it’s just not there
---
I wasn't complaining.  I was just surprised that my post was opposed to vehemently.  Some dude literally told me to either play the game and shut up or don't play the game and shut up.  Fanboys, what can one do?
---
Usually death law gauntlets or explosive shotguns
---
I’ll try doing that. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
The event is useless really, you get a silly mask, and it’s so easy no robots should ever die.
---
But none of that is the point.
---
The event IS fun. You can fart around doing whatever. I did one and one guy only a fat man to kill stuff, other people are naked or near so, emote spamming for amusement. People are actually chatting with one another both during and after, commenting on their misfortune or asking to buy someone else’s mask.
---
For something so simple and silly, it’s a smash hit.
---
Np
---
American Pickers would love your backyard. 
---
Ya they got this...they’ve done a great job so far,no reason to believe they would screw this up.
---
We had a nuked parade and finished it in less than 10 minutes. We just laughed that it was on hard mode
---
No, I'm not saying it should be nerfed, but realistically, the multitudes of people who have it are going to be an issue. 
---
Maybe give us more ways to deal with it? More stagger options, new paint grenades that counter stealthboys, better AP on weapons that fon't have it?
---
This is sad, but I am curious what were your SPECIAL/ PERKs for testing?
---
I'd give you gold if I had it. 
---
This is the most equitable solution because anyone can do it, and at their own pace. 
---
Character transfer between the two is the fairest scenario.
---
I doubt F76 has the player base to support segmented populations. It's not WoW or ESO, etc. Someone can prove me wrong with player base stats but that ain't happening.
---
If you are so thirsty for balanced, fair PvP, Fallout 76 is not the right place to look.  At least for some time into the future.
---
When I saw this the first thing that wntered my mind is "Deal with it"
---
I just want the jester mask to go with my Inspector costume, and I don't want to pay 25k caps for it, maybe more with how some players price shit. :(
---
I don’t believe that are dropping as intended. As much as I play...I would have at least seen one person wearing one. I play on xbox and not a single person in all my server hops has worn one or had it in the trade window. Something is wrong. This isnt “rare” this is some bs.
---
If this was the case wouldn't a very simple "hey they are meant to be that rare and are working correctly!" from the community managers be an easy fix. I feel like the radio silence is the most frustrating part 
---
Isn't the point of a rare item with a low drop rate so that not everyone can have one just by grinding the event till it drops for them? Otherwise why have the rare drop rate at all?
---
I felt like this was addressed by BGS at some point and they said they’re gonna make her loot pool better, but I still get 1star wood armor or tire irons like 20% of the time so idk. I’m fine with RNG but there’s gotta be a reasonable threshold for an end game boss. 
---
Hopefully the loot pool for the new vault raids is better. 
---
No.  I tried before the patch.  It was probably sunk into the building mesh
---
That's awesome, if only I was on PS4

5 fights and nothing I mean zero drop from her. I started the fight with an instigating shot and was part of the killing blow. Last fight I did I walked away with a level 20 2 star black powder pistol and she didn’t drop it. A damned diseased rad rat did. 
---
It wouldn't be so bad if there was some intermediate rarity masks between the common ones and the ultra rare ones.
---
I put a tricentennial head on mine so it would have an atom symbol
---
If something has a 5% chance of happening, it has a 95% chance of not happening. Thus, after 2 rolls, .95*.95=.9025. After, 14 attempts, at a 5% chance, you have a 50% chance for something to have never happened. 
---
Similarly, if something has a 1% chance of happening, after 6k attempts, it has a 6.4*10^-27 chance of having never occurred.
---
If something has a .1% chance of dropping, then there is a .2% chance it will never drop after 6k attempts.
---
It's a simple formula. (chance something will not happen)^(attempts) = chance it will not happen after that many attempts.
---
Suffice it to say, 6k is easily enough to measure this. The chances of it dropping once with a drop chance of even 1-in-1000 after 6k attempts is laughably low.
---
Conversely, a .01% chance of dropping after 9k attempts would be (.9999)^(9000)=~.41. Thus, a 41% chance for it to never drop after 10k attempts. 
---
Suffice it to say, having it drop once after 6k attempts is a blatant indicator that the drop rate is unreasonably low.
---
I haven't gotten a drop myself, but can confirm that I saw an Old Man Winter mask in the game tonight, on PC
---
Your a week early frienemy;)
---
Cool. Go back and grind whitespings for the thousandth time.
---
I think 3 would be good, for me at least. I'd prefer 5 but settle for 3.
---
1. Farming/regular nonsense
---
2. CRAFTING/BUILDING 
---
3. Scorched Queen/Raids etc where you're gonna need it right.
---
Not able to use quick presets in combat to prevent people's from swapping entire builds in a pvp/pve environment or something.
---
Lol what??
---
Also all the aster around the fast travel spot at whitesprings
---
There's a differwnce between rare and unobtainable.  With a .03 drop chance and only one week there may only be 10 total rare masks dropped in the whole game.  I don't mind the rare part it's that there so little time to find them that they really is no chance for even people like me who would love to gind for them to ever have a chance at them.
---
I saw an Old Man Winter in game tonight, so it's definitely out there
---
Everyone needs to get off the everything is duped bandwagon let’s nerf everything crap. Don’t even play if the past duping bothers you that much. All I hear is everyone has shit I don’t not fair wahhh. People murdering you should motivate you to grind better shit. Not beg for shit to get nerfed so you stop getting murdered. This community is starting to look pathetic 
---
So has trump
---
Good to know. I have a heavy guy who can handle them ok but he folds like paper. What about Cavalier melee builds though
---
Considering that these are limited to 3 a day and that the daily seems to have been broken for many players by the last patch, maybe you'll get more takers with a higher offer.
---
You still play fallout 76?
---
Just a note that there are unyielding sentinels and unyielding cavalier sets that bloodied can use.  So bloodied builds could be the ones using the sentinel.  The main culprit to seeming like you can't damage them isn't so much the damage reduction, but rather the dodgy perk and the serendipity perks.  Dodgy will eventually consume all their AP and they will start getting hit a lot.  
---
Not even close man the devs have tons of new content coming out the game has a good couple years if the devs take care of it
---
There are major issues with the game and they saying what you mentioned doesn’t help. 
---
People offering suggestions and even refining those suggestions might catch the eyes of developers if people like them. 
---
Of course there will be haters, I expect that. 
---
Which paint job are you interested in?
---
Maybe I should start using melee 
---
And when that gets to dark just turn them around and repeat the process 
---
Where did you get the beaver? Did it have to travel far to get to your camp?
---
The game doesn't make teams. You joined one.
---
So all the dudes with duped items and 300 levels earned from glitching grenades get a bunch of unique legendaries every week, that's super cool. 
---
Bitch calling US unbecoming but your ranting every chance you get. You even made a post to complain about us. Stfu dude. You act all high and mighty but you are just acting like an asshat.
---
Let's give all the guys with duped weapons and 300 grenade glitched levels unique legendaries every week, cool!
---
Hence the "if you have pacifist mode disabled." If you have it active, you can't damage other players so you can't accidentally tag someone.
---
Or just make it buried deep enough in menus they are dead if they swap out
---
I have found one two shot explosive, legit I believe, it was not high level, and pretty useless. I honestly don't care about losing the one I have because its probably duped. I didn't obtain it by dupes, and there is no proof ita duped except its rare. But I don't think purging everyones inventories indiscriminately is a solution to the duping problem. 
---
This game has had a ton of bad press, it doesn't have an exceptionally large playerbase, we really don't want to take a scorched earth approach to this.
---
Sure!
---
Thank you for stating this lvl 257 will always be #1 in the server they just one shot anyone no effort
---
This can't be a thing, I always run in and do the decorating robot first because it's quick and easy, and I just randomly pick the decorations each time. Still got an abundance of the ugly skeleton man masks.
---
Posts like this kinda crack me up,I mean take a minute and scroll down the sub.Do you think bots are making all these posts? After a few hours of scrolling come back here and decide if you really need to make this post.
---
It is different words for damage normalization. In other words weak weapons and effects become stronger while strong weapons and effects become weaker. The end result of damage normalization is that build and gear are less impotent when compared to skill.  In some games it is extreme where normalization brings the best gear to within 10% of trash. We have to wait and see how much normalization effects damage in game.
---
The map is giant, travel is either too slow or instant teleport, the server cap is tiny. Any sort of structured pvp just will be lame for it
---
Nobody is forcing you to do anything. Do what you want. That's literally the whole point.
---
You can download the xbox one app and type messages through your console to people with your phone. It's much faster than the clunky xbox version.  
---
Below the cliffs northwest from Top of the world there is a lead deposit. Camp there and farm or just help yourself if my camp is there. 
---
Well I have a bloodied ranged weapon and a bloodied melee weapon and they both have their uses.  I will say it's much easier to stay alive shooting from behind cover with only 10hp than it is to sprint into the groups of super mutants with only 10hp.  (as a matter of fact I end up having to NOT use my bloodied weapon and swap to vampire in that case) SO although melee can hit hard as fuck, you do have advantages with ranged as well (and easier to pull of the 3x or 2x sneak shots on the regular with ranged too)   For the type of game this is (it's not battle royale deathmatch after all) I think things are pretty balanced honestly.   Before the TSE nerf, range had all the advantages I described AND the damage lol.
---
In the menu could probably work great
---
Personal Space! All that skin getting in the way of your personal space?
---
I can't believe how ridiculously excited I was to actually farm in a game, I told my flatmates about the event, my BF... and now WOW I have a ridiculous amount of tooth guy and witch masks. So lame.
---
You're using a voluntary submission form. At any point someone could have inflated the numbers. Also once again we have no idea how many decimal places the 0 to 1 calculation goes. It's entirely possible that it's 5 or 6 or 7. Each one increases the odds that people won't get them even in 10k runs
---
Oh, good.
---
Plus, not everyone who plays is on Reddit, so there could easily be a good handful out there.
---
&gt;Someone also tossed a mini nuke up in the air at the bonfire just as the event was ending. It was funny but also a dick move...at least it didn’t affect the event.
---
I've like to show off my fatman during the event a bit. I wish I had other cool stuff like quad missile launcher. Anyway what's dick about it?
---
Thank you!
---
It's a shame it's a week long event. I have work all but 2 days, and on those 2 days it's my Mum's birthday and also I am moving house. Like... fuck dude. I just wanted some nice masks. I have way to many creepy tooth man and witch masks and that's about it.
---
Wasn't there the claim that moving the projector thing influenced your spawn point? Was that ever confirmed or debunked?

There is a mod for pc that does this, its fantastic.

What I have found is I basically use 5 of the 12 slots now.
---
1. Regular build - stealth and rilfle
---
2. Lock pick - stealth and lockpick
---
3. Hacking - stealth and hacking
---
4. Camp - camp perks and crafting armor etc, super duper
---
5. Same as 4 but for weapons as well. 
---
That's something I can get behind. 
---
Sadly I've tested that myself and it doesn't work. 
---
Their arguments ran from, "The game runs OK for me, so don't complain", to "Don't complain ever".  So... yah.

Okey, this was news to me. Thanks for clearing it up.

Everyone forgets survival mode says "BETA" on the front of it. Lets just all RELAX and see how it plays out. If it sucks, then maybe you argue with some data and facts about the game mode once there is some data and more facts to base it off of.   I wouldn't assume this is the final iteration of Survival mode.  
---
Troll account.
---
No
---
Appreciate that. Id be very interested in any legendaries specifically 
---
wish i could upvote your joke more than once. beautifully executed good sir
---
Ah yes, only ADULTS complain about not getting enough masks in video games!
---
Same I’ve never ever seen the “rare” mask at all unless they are in the protectrons of course 
---
Jimmy, u of your meds again...
---
Yes because its High tier armour you are complaining about having to use your brain to counter something. When you make something competitive thats what happens. Its not pve were you mindlessly click and shoot.  Don’t see how there is anything wrong with that people who put in the work on the markets deserve to me tougher to kill. You have no evidence to say something is “not intentional” you are not a developer for the game.
---
&gt;That seems very counterintuitive. Why would almost failing the event give better rewards?
---
Yes, why black powder rifles have such obsene range and damage, compared to modern assult rifles in the game?
---
If doing the event in one fairly natural way, over and over, doesn't seen to give you any of the masks you want, what do you do then? Drink brahmin milk and expect THAT to have any effect on the event mask rewards? 
---
OR, let some of the bots die? Majority of people would try that one first.
---
cool.
---
Went the other day post-nuke and the clubhouse was full of high level diseased (tell me how that makes sense) liberators. Carried decent loot and some plans though. 
---
Same here. White springs just isn't the same anymore even when a nuke is launched. 
---
I have knight currently, i’ll paint your t-60 free if you want
---
Dose it really mater? I mean I’m willing to do a 35 cap fast travel to collect a 5 cap bounty. The crime they committed is irrelevant. If their red their dead. 
---
I'm thinking an intoxicating syringer that makes the target unable to stand still would be about perfect.
---
I get glitches and crashes, happens in many games but the idea of purposely ruining others game time is wrong in my opinion. 
---
Having a survival mode were people can PvP and whatever else they want is a win win... they can pick it and get exactly what they want and more. 
---
Adventure mode shouldn’t involve PvP. 
---
Even workshops aren’t exactly great at getting materials when a good player can literally farm more material in the same amount of time or less. 
---
PvP players win on their server
---
PvE players win on their server
---
Win win...
---
No but by its nature of being an entertaining world that exists around the clock, it invites players who are more hardcore than others.  Honest question, is this your first online game?  
---
In the first few days following the guide that was datamined on how to get it  you would go to the house by the dead lake and the door that hides the keys would be open and the keys missing. That and every time someone generates a code to open that door it is server wide not personal so if someone was following in your footsteps you would swipe both cards go to the key pad and your code would not work because someone had changed it on you. My guess is with all the focus on the timed event people have put off getting the quantum paint and you got lucky. Gratz, but my post really was meant for people to see on the day it was posted 6 days ago. The advice therein is not really current anymore. 
---
I understand man, wishing you luck!
---
I feel like she alone should drop a fair 6-10 items and the event should give you the bulk of the good stuff. That way it’s not chanced if She drops it. Guaranteed loot. 
---
Wait nope im having this same issue on xbox when trying to enter the cave for a picture
---
I wish they could have labels! 
---
I feel that getting a max effect at 3 stars is too much. 1 star should be enough since we can acquire purified water to quench thirst very easily. Or giving some more positive effects would make it worth using as 3 stars.
---
Why not?
---
I will say, anyone who snags a rare one will be able to trade it for basically whatever they want.  People are obsessed with collecting.  
---
Surely I saw one more type has two rings in site...am I dreaming? LoL 
---
Yeah i went with "projector thing" to be sure people knew what I ment. lol
---
Apparently some Bethesda fanboys would prefer to downvote than offer their opinions, BGS did recognize this as a problem and said they were working on a fix to her loot pool. Some people would prefer to quietly downvote than offer anything of substance tho. 
---
What if that 5000 is after using the weight reduction cards? 
---
How long does it usually take cuz I e tried this on the mega sloth and I got nothing with bloody mess on lv2.
---
Thanks much. The Super Duper Mart security team is always happy to help.

Enjoy the Wasteland! Thats all i can say :)
---
Just got this from Beth support [https://imgur.com/LYGQVh4](https://imgur.com/LYGQVh4). So I think all this accounts shouldn't be unbanned at all. And the guys who really duped had a chance to transfer their items to other accounts. This means that Beth f\*\*\*ed up even in punishing. Bravo!
---
Difference is most of his is deserved
---
Calm down, son, your mommy should be here soon.
---
Though I wouldn't blame her if she just left you in the store and didn't return...
---
Every Bethesda game is inherently grindy. People who are saying "I just don't wanna go through the grind again" are actually saying "I don't want to play the game I paid money to play." 
---
&gt;you can still fast travel
---
I built a trap once on top of an acid node. Can't fast travel if you're taking damage, and since it's environmental it didn't give me a bounty. 
---
I've only seen pictures of the fabled items. I've yet to see one with my own eyes. But I've never even seen pictures of the Jester or Skull masks.

It’s happening. I now own Site Charlie.
---
If rare becomes common,is it really rare? Supposedly some of these masks have a .03% drop chance,that’s essentially what makes them rare.If you got one and wanted to sell it,you would be on here touting “how rare and valuable” it was.

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethe...

It's dead.  You can stop posting here now.  
---
Still selling?
---
I'll upload one in a minute I just got on get on and take one I don't have any pictures of it.
---
I forget his name but a guy in here did the math and has all the drops rates mapped out. It’s on this Reddit somewhere. 
---
What quest produced the hat?
---
Yes but he’s not dead yet.
---
Can i get a link confirming what the devs said
---
&gt;Welp raidings not going to be as fun anymore
---
You can still take workshops and kill people who try to defend them, which seems like a raider thing to do. 
---
And that's the point, it's not. I've had those guys spawn onto my base on more then one occasion pretty central only because a high level player infested the area.
---
pretty much the same thing, stagger will get them (or just running out of AP).  A lot of the tankyness is from the "Dodgy" perk and "Serindipity" perk too, so once the AP runs out (from either sprinting around chasing you or dodgy getting used up due to rapid fire weapon) they will start getting hit more (and not be able to sprint, thus negating the damage reduction from cavalier as well)   
---
Also the newsletter made it seem like there were going to be balance changes anyway, though I'm not really sure, they weren't specific lol.      
---
" We’ve made some over-arching adjustments to PVP damage in Survival Mode to make weapons feel even more deadly in your hands, while also limiting the likelihood that another dweller can drop you in one hit. "
---
Yeah one second one of them commented a couple times on another post
---
First I’m not saying they need to make it super common, I’m saying that it is next to impossible to get just one and that’s a bit crazy. Second I wouldn’t brag about how I got something rare out of the event, I’m not that kind of person. 
---
Same I’m sure the rest of the pics are dev room left overs. But who knows lol. 
---
Which post?
---
Speaking of that,why the hell are we using an old school overhead projector as a C.A.M.P? Lol
---
Somebody did a questionnaire over like 100s of people, then ran the numbers. Only 2 people claimed to have gotten, but didn't have proof, so chances are they were lying. But even if you take those people into account, you would need to complete the event 100 times to get about a 63% chance to get a mask according to the statistics of that data. But that being said. I know MANY people who have been grinding the event 100+ times and none have gotten it. You'd think that I'd those statistics are true, more than 50% of people who completed the event 100 times would have gotten the mask. Yet, I personally don't know anyone who has gotten.
---
salty duper detected
---
"do what you want" but not anything you don't like apparently judging from your past comments. Iether way your free to think the games flawless in terms of mode crossover just as I'm free to think if they do this they will just be sticking another nail in the coffin as the game mode will be broken upon arrival at best.
---
Well, I think they (and their stuff) has been removed. But yes. Also, I like your name
---
Agreed. I come here for game info like what people think about weapons and 'is this a glitch?' I have to look through a lot of fluff regarding what the developer should do/should have done. 
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3bw4b/fasnacht_event_rewards/eizgtbq?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is the link to the "Bethesda Replied" bots compilation of what she said
---
Over 200 hours in and I'm only LV. 61. I avoided events and nuke zones for a while. My best advice for fast levels is get a hazmat suit and tag everything you can in a nuke zone and keep running. You get XP for everything you hit. Stash ALL your junk because you will die... A LOT... but even in the mid 50s I went up 3 levels in a nuke zone.
---
Where's your base located? I bet i can figure this out really quick. Give me the closest landmark.
---
OMG I can't believe I misread that so badly.  Duuh.
---
&gt;So, is there a second munitions factory that I just don’t know about?
---
The output on that place is shit compared to just gathering steel and cloth, which are 2 of the most common items in the game. 
---
Set up camp on an acid node. Use that and cloth to make gunpowder. Gather sttel and  scrap all the shit weapons for more steel. Make ammo. Profit? 
---
reto tech feel I would guess. I used to have one of those things in my attic.
---
All of them.
---
I honestly think they are but devs said they are actually dropping soooooo idk
---
A thought: are you using a bluetooth headset?  During the beta I tried to use one, and got similar issues.  I tried again recently and it didn't crash, but it did mess up the sound.  It has to do with how the game uses audio (incorrectly).
---
The only fix was disabling chat, or using a wired mic.
---
I guess we will have to wait and see
---
Lmk how much you need, 1 cap per bullet 
---
You could just switch servers and have your base back if someone’s built in your location 
---
I'm not telling you what to do at all. I don't care what you do. You can't do anything I "don't like", because I don't care what you do. But you aren't going to tell me how to play the game either.
---
I agree with what you're trying to say. I also understand a huge concern people in favor of a lock are trying to address - we can't guarantee that people starting the beta with amazing builds on day one obtained that gear legitimately, and it tilts the balance towards cheaters.
---
I think a simple solution is to say you can hop back and forth, but you can't use any character you created before survival launches, or that you can't bring any gear you got before that time. We'd all show up as fresh looking vault dwellers of varying skill. We get to keep our experience but have to find new gear. Any gear originally obtained in Adventure *after* the launch would also be fair game to bring back to survival. 
---
&gt;What do you mean “use workshop PvP to hunt people” ? Can you be engaged in PvP due to owning a workshop even if you’re across the map? 
---
Yup. The most common tactic for groups is to find you on the map and have 1 or 2 fast travel to your location. Their friend contests the workshop, which immediately flags you for PvP, and then they pop you before you can fast travel. 
---
"Sleeping" in a bed (laying in it for a minute or two) will give you the Well Rested effect that gives you an XP boost, I think it's 10% or 15%.
---
Yeah, I don’t know how many times I’ve done it but me and friends haven’t seen or gotten any of them and it’s really frustrating   
---
I think it's fine. It's just that they did it in a player hoarding game. It reminds me of rare items like you see in MMOs. Something to actually make a few people unique. If this is the norm and they do many events then it can be pretty damn cool. It's not like you don't get to walk away with a few masks and patterns. 
---
Radroaches are appearing a lot in White Springs now. I’ve gotten zapped a few times already which is weird. Never saw them before.
---
No one could blame her.
---
I'll have to start building with brick more often, seeing it in a lot of these camp screenshots and y'all are making it look good.
---
Because it is a horrible idea. You get a bounty for doing something to someone or their property. They, and/or, others should get a chance for retribution. Orherwise you could level camps and grief people with little to no consequences. Plus people would just camp that vendor and kill wanted players anyway.
---
You can only upgrade things like the barrel,  stock, sights and muzzle you can't make it a higher level. 
---
No but maybe with the legendary vendor coming out you can recycle it towards a better lever action. The Purveyor is coming in May but no much word on how it’ll actually work.
---
Thanks for pointing that out, I'll have to head back to him and do another round, then.
---
Happened to me last night except the guy was waiting for me, so i nicked his turret, killed all the super mutants and liberators only for him to kust wall up to me and one hit kill me, stole all my junk which was a fine collection of lead, steel, screws, springs and adhesive then immediately logged of. Felt like an exploit as he is was basically luring players in to trap them. 
---
Join on me now I’m back in the server 
---
I would figure I'd have to do meaningful damage. Huh, I'll have to give it a shot. Thanks for the idea.
---
I've been doing that. I like messing around with my camp so I noticed that very quickly
---
Yep - being able to farm up in peace then swap to the other mode kind of takes the tension out.
---
However, without periodic progression resets it's all going to go to hell in a few weeks anyway.
---
Survival really calls out for a 3 month progression reset - something similar to PoE leagues? That way you can reliably have a re-influx of players every few months on even terms, to check out any new content and keep the game alive.
---
61, Xbox, more time than ever to game now I'm "retired".....
---
There was spawn point mat, literally in the game during the beta. What the wrong with them. Something that brings so much pain, and the solution already exists. It's like they WANT to torture us.
---
I thinks it too complicated for them to pull off,honestly.Im super curious how much stuff gets broken with the new survival mode coming out.
---
Will be harder than it used to be. There were a lot more nukes. I’m talking a few a night or more. You could level 7 or 8 times per nuke even if you were over lvl 100.  They nerfed that. XP much less now. Avoid going to nuke where Scorchbrast is (SE map) for a while as you’d be too low to do anything. 
---
But I would just grind quests. Also the golf course still has good spawns and mobs to level. 
---
Good luck 
---
You have that many sets of T60?
---
Ok, also keep your eyes out for Cranberry Relish for another 10%.
---
Let me Stimpak you
---
How did you get your kitchen table. 
---
It's worth having but not necessarily equiped all the time. Just equip them when you need to unlock something then switch them out. 
---
there was a quest that failed there i think
---
Yeah, I'd like to speculate that they will add some kind of damage mitigation  hard cap and a damage bonus hard cap or something along those lines.  BUT just speculation I dunno :P
---
That’s hot you have Xbox 
---
I just posted a similar idea! I only had one small change. They should timestamp when an item spawned in the world. If it spawned before survival released, it can't go to survival. Anything after is okay. This is really only to eliminate the possibility of duped items finding their way into a PvP zone.
---
100% wrong I am LVL 174 with 7 2 shot exsplosive guns decontamination chamber ammo to last a life time the issue I lent new player does not stand a chance all so thousands of people with dupe items being put in to it I want new character to stop all this shit going in 
---
yeah
---
It's not. And it's the jarring difference between this games community to others I am a part of that makes me say this. I understand a hardcore mentality. But we are talking about a little parade. 76s first event experiment meant to bring people together and give a few items away, spark curiosity so maybe out of the millions of players only a couple hundred get certain masks. 
---
People shouldn't expect to grind this thing out and get every single unlockable item. 
---
This has nothing to do with what games I've played and how much you condescending dandy fop!
---
Currently? Near lakeview manor cause highlevels stay away from there. But i've had bases north, in the mountains, swamp and down south...literally everywhere but whitespring and down southeast that have been overrun by scorchbeasts. Areas that have lv20-30 enemies no problem until a lvl 100+ sets foot there and is messing the level range of the area up.

When did I ever tell you how to play? I made a statement that suggested servers need to be separated, last I checked your not a dev you have 0 say in game mechanics so I'm not telling you shit. Your just someone on Reddit whom thinks if they keep accusing someone of telling other people how to play they are somehow right, when in reality I'm trying to make the game better as without separate charecters there will be no reason to play survival as a legit player due to the dupe economy and quite a few players were hoping for survival to be the reason to jump back in with fresh charecters as it stands that would be suicide.
---
I’ve been digging holes in my yard,but I haven’t found even 1 Spanish dabloom,wtf?
---
Personally I have yet to play FAllout 76 but I will be picking it up next week strictly for survivor mode. I enjoy PVP and love the unique interactions of open world multiplayer games like Day Z, Sea Of Thieves, Dark Zone in The Division. Hearing Fallout would be updated with an open world PVP focused experience was a dream come true. Unfortunately, now that I hear people's characters will transfer I'm afraid to say I'll be one shotted on sight lol. BUT, hopefully it's not too lopsided where I can maybe put up a fight, If not, I'll have to be really good with my diplomacy skills.
---
Don't they only bloom at night? 
---
Yep 1 .38 or 10mm ANYWHERE on a target gives you XP once it's killed. If memory serves me correctly there is a hazmat suit on the roof of Poseidon power plant.
---
No. I’m talking about the plans for the BOS not painting the sets lol.
---
I seen the sun mask but they might've got that from the dev room
---
Please don’t encourage nerfing.  It never ends well. 
---
Some plans may need perk requirements 
---
Nah, you didn’t. I mentioned *radium rifle* rad damage (your first #2, and the one with a value of 15) as my number 2. You bring up *Gamma Gun* rad damage as your number one. So not just different order, but not even a correct response to what I was saying. 
---
If you aren’t going to actually put some attention in to your responses, it’s not worth my time to address them.
---
So, what I'm gathering from this is you're just going to say the same thing over and over and wallow in your supposed superiority while really you're just bitching and moaning like a child because you aren't getting your way? Got it.
---
I've played full on survival pvp games where you lose literally everything when you die. I'm no stranger to that. But those games were typically a lot better balanced than this one is, had a lot more build diversity, and pvp was generally a lot more rewarding.
---
can you give an example so we know it isnt like when people think there is an issue when it turns out they forgot to read the plan?
---
Haha Haha
---
PVP has ruined fallout. Period.
---
I’m online
---
I heard about that, the only thing that seems rational to me is they removed it due to you being able to set up 'traps' to kill people who fast travel to your base. 
---
Now only people who are in your team can see or fast travel to your base though so it makes no sense to me. 
---
keep on sloggin you'll get there. If you're a power armor wearer I think you'll do fine, that last part was a particular pain because of my build, and another part in alpha(dunno bout the others) you HAVE to wear a hazmat if you're not in pa or radiation gets ya. gl to ya!
---
I reckon it's bugged and Bethesda are just covering their arses to say it's meant to be like that. If they don't communicate, then people think it's possible, and therefore people play more or grind more, which is good for them. They could theoretically be changing the percentages for the last few days, but not tell anyone, and everyone grinds for something that may become easier later. They did it with the VTU jacket. Who knows
---
I don't know man, not from what I can tell. Maybe they were bugged yesterday...
---
My two buddies where just talking about this very subject while teamed up tonight. We all had this very concern. Please start people off from the beginning. We are all excited but having the same disadvantage against high leveled players would suck. 
---
Wtf
---
They are available outside of Dyer Chemical along the river anytime the Event: Heart of the Swamp is active. Just wait or server hop until you find that event. The go to Dyer Chemical instead and pick the Strangler Blooms.
---
Ya honestly I don’t think they have a clue what they are doing,they are just throwing content out there.
---
Ah. No I ate them sorry 
---
That's OP more than the TSE used to be 
---
I had to wait for one to meat pile yesterday.
---
Yes please! Perhaps they could make it so entering survival dupes your character. That way you don't lose anything
---
Well neither of the chem or ammo station plans are working(but that might be just due to perks or something) But I recently got the acoustic instruments plans yet I can't use them.
---
You phat
---
Isn't it a lathe/workbench?
---
Exactly. This system doesn't work anyway. I built on a mountain and occasional when I or other people fast travel to my base, they appear and fall off the side of the mountain. 
---
I'm on for about another hour if you're on.
---
Yeah, they weren't blooming for me during the Heart of the Swamp quest...
---
Pure lazy developers I will not be buying there future games after this shit show 
---
Sounds like somebody needs to drink some nukashine and then go to the parade 😂
---
So, it'd probably be actually beneficial to tell us what the actual message was, because I promise it wasn't telling you that FO76 bent you over. 
---
If you had your base built somewhere and another *player* built in the same spot, server hopping will plop your base right down where it was. 
---
If you built your base somewhere that Bethesda has now placed a new structure, you're SoL.. but we've also got an ever evolving world, so I guess that's to be expected. 
---
Either way, calm down and don't act like a child and people may be more willing to help. 
---
Yes! I want this music as well!
---
I’m getting close I just need to buy the open neon sign. 
---
Haha haha.
---
It’s going to be all about ranged users. Right now slap damage allows melee to be in your face before full PVP initiates. Now snipers can sit in chameleon in a bush 300 feet away and sniper 1shot you immediately, at any time, there’s no “initiate PvP” needed.
---
Survival is in fact battle arena to test your build and gear vs other players, they just want to use different misleading name for this game mode...
---
Thanks for the serums and for painting my power armor. :) Also that power armor station is bad ass!
---
What happens currently when someone uses your workbench?
---
If you can't figure out how to kill a bloodied unarmed build before they kill you, you need to git gud. Period.
---
My pleasure! And thank you!!
---
Thanks :). I thought it was more like excessive dupers were banned but stacks were reduced to 1 and nothing could really stop the flood of items into market. And the levels dont really matter a ton after 50 anyways .
---
I think so, mostly in preparation for upcoming content. 
---
However,  I am a HUGE fan of the IP so if you are not- perhaps get s few more opinions. 
---
Run to the railroad tracks then back. Worked for me.
---
Lewis burg is on the edge of the ash heap, you get random earthquakes around there. 
---
The message is a failed/abandoned Enclave quest, not sure why you would have heard it at your level though
---
You can upgrade a 3* Bloodied machete to a 4* with the blade mod, I have one. 
---
I added a scorch receiver to a 3* vampire combat rifle and it now has 4*
---
The machete rocks, the combat rifle is “ok”...
---
If I get a duplicate I will let you know 
---
About time! And those "raiders" can go to Survival mode and face off other like minded players and the PvP'ers.
---
I know thats why I added that melee aren't the only build that can 1 shot 
---
I agree the main menu would also be a good place. We just need a system in place to vote on major changes to the game as a whole fan base. Not 10% of the fan base that tend to be hardcore players. 
---
Lmao all these snipers are about to rich haha 
---
Thanks. 
---
PA or out of nuke zone?
---
Hmm haven't seen enemies change names midway. Did it have the diseased  symbol still.
---
Pa
---
New update? You mean the one new quest or what?
---
To be fair if they do reset, in a few months or even weeks op players will be killing new players. regardless if we make new players. It just puts a bandage on the problem I feel OP 
---
Exactly my thoughts. It always seemed like a huge waste to have multiplayer fallout and make it essentially co op pve.
---
Strange brew apparently but I found mine at a vendor. Someone obviously didn't realise what they were selling. It's actually what got me looking into this in the first place.
---
Maybe you already picked the non-blooming Strangler Pods in the last 24 hours (and if so the Blooms won't show) or someone beat you to them on that server. And if so try again on another server.
---
Cool. I'll be there
---
I'm pretty positive it's going to have tons of players so it'll be a success without the people who dont play often and want everyone who does play often to have to start over. 
---
Lakeview manor? Riverside, near new gad?
---
you sound really rude btw. and although this guy isnt articulating it very well, it is forcing us to do something, its forcing us to play with people who have perfect, likely duped, gear sets, and stand zero chance of not getting 1 shot all the time as a new character. Oh just play adventure mode, you say. Yeah, adventure mode sucks, and people still have perfect, likely duped, gear sets. 
---
Advantage: counter-sniper team of at least 2
---
It will likely be deleted again, unfortunately.  Whatever causes that error isn't always reflected by where it lets you place your CAMP.
---
If they were smart they would have polled the fan base (not just social media) about what they want. If they allow carryover and it doesn’t work out they are stuck. There is no going back without a wipe and a major uproar from the community. 
---
The big one "wild appalachia"one. 
---
I am a huge fan of the IP but that quest issue bothered me a lot. Is it fixed???
---
Getter now before they realize 
---
So what happens in survival, if someone starts the queen event? It’s a double group effort in some cases but everyone will be accidentally killing each other while trying to clear trash mobs? Love the concept and I get it’s going into beta. Everyone knows it will be flawed or highly flawed. It’s a learning experience for sure. But we can give examples where pvp servers maybe considered for an early polish vs. waiting until the mode comes out and some dumbass YouTuber starts trashing Bethesda when they either don’t play the game, got banned and still an emo teenage girl about it or one of those players that will never be happy until the game plays itself.
---
Hopefully examples by players will be read and considered so we can all help the game grow. You can’t please everyone. My suggestion is, stop trying to please everyone. Some legitimately want the game to grow and others have no idea what they want, nor want a challenge in a survival game. It’s a survival game. You should feel some sort of discomfort. Not feel like it’s so easy to thrive. 
---
Haven’t seen any big update,just a new quest and a parade.
---
no idea. shouldn;t be a perk issue. what is the problem you build menu is giving you? usually says if you need to find the plans or mats or flat ground or something.
---
I've avoided PVP altogether because the PVP mechanics are so unbalanced it's not even funny.  It would be nice if they put them all on thier own server so they can leave everyone else out of thier need to turn it into PUBG.
---
Putting the kids to bed. Will be back in about 20 min. 
---
Is 1200 good? I have some armor pieces I can throw in as well
---
I'm one of the deathclaw crowd and I get killed all the time. Way more than other builds lol. 15% health doesn't cover much damage you know.
---
They all survive EVERY SINGLE TIME. This is a bs response.
---
The people who are going to waste their ammo and resources chasing down low level kids with no loot are going to be few and far between. It isn't worth it. Just jump to a new server and you've solved the issue. That isn't a real problem.
---
And I don't care if I sound rude when dealing with stupid people such as the person above.
---
I won't be surprised. I'll just regret several life choices. I have no idea where to go, though. Apparently building near any other train station will get me griefed for blocking legendary spawns or something.
---
It's been here for a week, no issue, then suddenly, poof!
---
I really like this game. But... I'm starting to lose my will to actually play it.
---
I lockpicked a Supply pod, I had no idea it belonged to someone else, I was very confused.
---
Almost like they fixed it in the last patch.
---
Probably the handmade rifle. With perk cards the melee weapon’s beat it by miles, but in terms of raw dps and ease of use, that rifle feels the best 
---
Thanks! Ive been thinking about knocking it all down again already hahaha
---
that is an on going update. it wasnt all updated at once. so far brewry quest items and daily has been added along with the fausnacht event going until the 26th. 
---
the 26th (this tuesday) will see survival servers open up.
---
At least wait until it launches to lament. Since it's a beta the devs are open to adjusting things as needed. Also there are like a dozen other threads about this topic already. Don't really see why another one is necessary.
---
Giant is also kinda goblinesque.
---
What this guy said, also no one is unkillable in this game everything has a counter bloodied build use a gamma gun? Sentinal armour? stagger and crits
---
An opt-in Season model is the best option, starting with Survival Mode. 
---
In a season model, every few months there is a new "season" and new characters can be made that are separate from the current characters you can play. These new characters are brand new, on a completely different segment of servers and characters, and only play with each during the duration of the season.
---
At the end of the season and at the start of the new season, these characters are retired into the "normal" pool of characters and can be played forever with everyone else. They don't go away and they aren't deleted.
---
The end of one seasons starts the next one with the same situation. New characters can be made in their own pool of new characters. Sometimes there is a unique reward you start with for your accomplishments in the last season, or there are new tweaks to the game play that make playing fresh again exciting (like a new game mode). Other times it is the culmination of changes made during the season that makes it appealing to try playing the game all over again or doing a new character build.
---
The seasons are typically 3 months, 6 months, or even longer. They provide a totally optional way for existing players to restart with friends or other new players, or compete with each other to do things better than they did last season. It is also a really natural way for new players to start on a level playing field in terms of character progression, but encourage them to start to learn the game in the middle of a season to prepare for the next if that interests them.
---
If done well, Seasons are really cool and are totally optional. Some folks even start a new season for the first few week or month experience, then jump back to their normal characters. They are a win-win for all player types!
---
Prime Bloodied Explosive .50 cal has to be one of the highest for dps
---
Right see but you would at least have to have a chance to find one do you know for a fact someone buried one there . 
---
Actually now that I think about it, probably the missile launcher with the targeting computer and the quad barrel. Sure it’s ammo is heavy, but if you can see a battle from start to finish, you’ll be clearing bad guys in record time with that thing. 
---
Whats what the pvp server is for
---
So I should just ignore cancerous and problematic items why exactly??
---
These 2 things do not compare
---
Yeah, but what I’m saying is, with the Survival mechanics, Ranged are going to be much worse than melee. 
---
Reward for being on the leaderboards? 
---
Let us build a shrine in our CAMP that gets more elaborate the higher you are on the leaderboard. 
---
#1 basically can build a Pantheon in their own honor. 
---
If they could just hard cap damage reduction to 85% it would fix the problem
---
I thought I was in a Dev World and could get banned ,but when Fast Traveled to the Event, I got Protectrons instead.
---
Oh, okay.  I haven't seen anything official yet.
---
They really just need to look at runescape and do what Jagex does. So may features that would make 76 better. I'm talking OSRS, not RS3
---
Wasn't giant. I have 3 giant masks.
---
An there’s a lot of scrubs there doing no damage, just got kicked after 1k ultracite rounds but joining back in let’s see if we can kill her before the guns break
---
When to start pvp you need to hit each other? So they'll be right in your face anyway, you clearly PVP less then I already do because it's broken. "Git gud" 😂 youre probably the type of toxic player who runs around with the build spoiling the game for everyone because you've got nothing better to do.
---
It's happening. 
---
I have a 2 shot missile launcher with a quad barrel.and targeting comp its fun as hell to shoot lol

Seasons are the answer to this, or some variation of it. Everybody wins with an opt-in for fresh start model (read to the end, the details mater): 
---
You know you're getting fo5
---
Yeah true, I don't claim to know who to fix the problem just adding my comment on the matter.
---
There are so many..... I cant read all comments, but have we tried to nuke the town and do the event? Just curious.....
---
&gt;Everyone else's anecdote is wrong, my anecdote is true tho.
---
I just calculated it out to make sure I have enough (and maybe some extra to help out with your good deeds). I might be short on a few of the fluxs but Ill try and grab some by tomorrow or the weekend.
---
I'll shoot you a friend request in the meantime though. I'll make sure to send a message tomorrow on reddit to make sure when you're available too.  
---
Im looking at getting:

No he just understands the mechanics of the game, give me an example of something thats op and ill tell you how to counter it
---
Thank you for your thoughtful commentary. 
---
Well deff kill her 
---
Oh you! 
---
What region?
---
People could contribute from any console, since they now have easy share functionality, and the game files are the same on every console. We see in the datafiles what appear to be errors in the distribution function that even the "uncommon" masks will drop almost never, and be exactly as rare as the "rare" masks.
---
This update is coming next Tuesday,chances are it’s been coded for some time and is going through final checks.Doubtful they are just gonna scrap it now and go back to the drawing board.They have laid out a strict timeline for all this stuff happening.Its about time to realize it won’t be changed any time soon.Once this update drops,they have other stuff they need to get finalized for April release.Yep I’m predicting by sept we should have one huge buggy mess.
---
Truth is that the people who play this game the most dont want to throw away 700+ hours of progress to use this mode.
---
I know it's going to be I'm also talking about the current pvp situation as well
---
100%, everyone bleeds.
---
I'm really not 
---
Isn’t every game a cash grab, they are made to make money that’s what businesses do
---
Gonna guess you don't really play.
---
There are a lot of MMO’s that have ran the gauntlet and figured out how things should work. Don’t know why bethesda insists on reinventing the wheel and not learning from others mistakes. 
---
Btw I loved OSRS. 
---
49 Xbox. Sydney Australia TZ
---
I bought it and they have my cash....
---
Oh look,it’s the “is this game dead” guy,how cute.
---
hey look a troll.
---
I had not seen that, thanks for sending that over. Kind of crazy that they are that rare then, but hey there game there decision I suppose. All we can do now is protest 
---
Sounds good, I’m not on now but in like 12 or so hours I’ll be back online and will let you know what I got for ya. 
---
To be fair, even if it was the other way around, people would be bitching about "I've played this for 400 hours and now I have to start over?! Uninstall!"
---
I'm almost tempted to try for that Medical Malpractice; unfortunately, I might be  really busy that week. :(
---
Maybe once the Legendary Vendor is out  it will be possible to get a .44 with those 3 effects.
---
Why should normal people care what a violent anti-social psychopath wants, other than to deny it to him/her? 
---
 Civilization, by design, is a solution to the 'raider' problem so suck it up buttercup and go torture your pet or something.
---
How about no? You’ve provided no arguments to support why this should happen. I’ve stated mine in other posts.
---
or make it so hacking or utility perks cost 0 SPECIAL to equip
---
Oh ok is the fassnacht stuff fun enough to log back in for??
---
I’m literally shaking how could you say something so controversial 
---
I think it works like this: 
---
**When OTHER people fast travel to your camp:** they will spawn on the original location where you dropped your CAMP container / bot thing. 
---
**When YOU fast travel to your camp:**  you spawn right near the edge of the build border. This seems to be a fixed location for you every time. 
---
What I do now is build my initial camp bot with the intention of it being the spawn point for other people. I then quickly fast travel to my own camp and see where my personal fast travel point is located. I then build around those 2 points. 
---
If you get a bad personal spawn location, pick up and move your camp. I think it may be related to the actual direction of the camp placement container / bot when you place it down. 
---
I hope this helps until they fix it or add a fast travel mat!
---
Me too. I thought I’d bee cool but the 10 cap bounty was like blood to sharks. Lasted about 19 seconds. 
---
exactly, so WHAT new content is a 700_ hour player going to find in survival besides hunting down any and everyone. 
---
I just imagine this lonely ass dude sitting by himself in the dark bumping *We're Not Gonna Take It* on a loop feeling so woke rn
---
If they stop the transfer in a week or so there will be op builds killing low levels anyway 
---
You will all die painfully if they do, maaawahahahahah. Really I'm sire they will, would put strain on servers to have half with weapons no longer offered and half without and then no bugs due to it. I'm looking at you TSE guns 
---
I don't want to have to change my whole build just to counter someone leaving the character basically useless at everything else. That's why Id like different characters for survival so we can make pvp only builds. 
---
My main character is built for pve only as an all round build because I enjoy playing that way I don't want to be stuck using only heavy guns or only rifles etc. 
---
To follow up, moving your CAMP container / bot after you place your camp down, it does NOT move the OTHER person fast travel spawn location within your camp. It will always be where you first dropped it to place your camp.
---
Only bounty I've got was from accidentally hitting someone's camp item when swinging at enemies a while back - of course they and their 3 high level buddies hunted me down in X01 and destroyed my entire camp in revenge.
---
Every time someone posts about their fucking awesome shop its PC or PS4. An xbox people have shops?
---
I enjoy it, but I have been enjoying the game since nov so your mileage may vary.
---
Buzzblade 
---
Seems to be enough. Last few PvP I was in ibshit the guy a couple times. He got close and one shotted me.
---
Cash grab is what thry call **your mom** OP!
---
If they’re teamed, they’re probably in party/team chat. I play Xbox and it’s too much of a pain to switch party chat off to talk to a random for a second, then rejoin. No one I play with uses in-game team chat so it’s harder to switch.
---
When I play solo, I don’t use my headset unless I run into someone that I have a good interaction with. I don’t see other players 99% of the time so always having a mic on so everyone can hear my ambient popcorn crunching seems unnecessary. 
---
The dev’s should have their throats torn out over this. The devs turned a fun event into something now most of us have begun to hate.
---
Can u imagine if all their future events are like this? Come on dude who side are u on. 😂😂
---
I was in on a few again today. Thanks.
---
I think it works like this:
---
**When OTHER people fast travel to your camp:** they will spawn on the original location where you dropped your CAMP container / bot thing. Moving this later does not impact the spawn location. It will always be where you first dropped it. 
---
**When YOU fast travel to your camp:** you spawn right near the edge of the build border. This seems to be a fixed location for you every time.
---
What I do now is build my initial camp bot with the intention of it being the spawn point for other people. I then quickly fast travel to my own camp and see where my personal fast travel point is located. I then build around those 2 points.
---
If you get a bad personal spawn location, pick up and move your camp. I think it may be related to the actual direction of the camp placement container / bot when you place it down.
---
TSE mini gun accelerated barrel  🤘
---
That's exactly what I was thinking. Probably just Bethesda being incompetent with their code... again, but it would be cool if it was a bait event
---
I know what you mean.  I just had my first instance of the Scorchbeast Queen flying away right in the middle of a successful run.  Man, that's infuriating, especially when you realize it's been like that for *months* at this point.  It's also why Survival Mode ticks me off.  I'm happy PvP fans have a place to go, but it's not like Bethesda has really polished Adventure mode.  Things like the SBQ, the many busted Events, the quirks in the main quest - all of that adds up.
---
The problem is that it only works for like the first week, once people hard grind Survival mode then you still end up with high level people destroying low levels that just enter Survival mode
---
I actually don't like PVP and very rarely engage. I have never attacked someone who didn't want to PVP or even persisted in a fight when the participant accidentally engaged but indicated a desire to back out.
---
Like another poster said, I just understand how the mechanics work. I run a bloodied melee/rifle build. I actually prefer to melee, but end up using rifles much more frequently. If I die from a melee attack, it's because I fucked up, period.

I agree with most except for the fact duping is not quashed. It never will. Gamers will always find a loop hole to get what they want. No matter what we, as the gamers, say it will always be unbalanced to someone here or there. The game is amazing regardless of duping, crashing, etc. You just gotta find the right people to play with.
---
If you're not going to prepare for PvP, don't bitch about losing PvP.
---
Don't they eventually expire?
---
He's annoying as hell, don't bother 
---
The Chinese are invading of course.
---
I dont think we have been playing the same online games, haha.  You're a funny guy though.  I kill you last
---
The Charleston station is the one that will get you griefed every time.  There is a random event vendor that spawns there and camps disable the spawns there.  That vendor sells some of the rarer outfits.  If you like being near the Whitespring station go to the area behind the dumpsters for plenty of room and the odds are very, very low that will be a quest area in the future.
---
You have to read the plans first from your pip boy
---
If the argument for the initial reset is to clear out dupe economy brokenness, there wouldn't need to be continual resets. Just the first clean slate to clear out any lingering dupe mess and from there it's however people managed to grind themselves up.
---
Lots of great advice in here, here’s something I figured out.
---
Every so often, go scavv a low level area, just take some shitty weapon that uses an ammo you typically don’t. No reason to use your best on trash. A school with lead weights is good for this.
---
You assume everyone is a dick 
---
Wow nice I hadn't heard of that being tamable you don't recall where u found it do u?
---
You don't need a build to counter bloodied melee characters. You need a Nuka grenade. Just one.
---
At one point it stops just working and becomes just infuriating tbh
---
You shouldn't get _angry_ playing a game like this. I'm mid-way through rebuilding my CAMP and I realise it's a fraction too high, so I'd need steps to get in the back door, but the steps are all too big.
---
I'm genuinely unhappy playing this, sometimes. It doesn't help that my character is getting hungry and thirsty a lot faster than he used to.
---
I'm a new player (level 12). How do you turn the technical data into plans?
---
Only thing that surprises me is why you keep posting on a subreddit of a dead ,cash grab game.
---
No... Stop thinking reddit peapole is the majority of players.... 
---
so we are getting troll spamed? is these going to havent everytime bethesda puts out and event/update people like?
---
Where can I find the plans for the BoS recon rifle?
---
Well thats your fault then, you had months to prep for the PvP server you knew it was coming they announced charcters were gonna transfer over but you ignored all that now you pay for your actions fortunately.
---
What are you taking about? I hope to God you're not trying to make a point with Twitch streaming numbers. 
---
Soooo you're saying, even though I have spent nearly every hour of my spare time in the last two days, and even if I try again for 4 days until the event expires that it's nearly impossible that I will find the Jester mask? O , fabulous! How rewarding. The incentive is real LMAO
---
It will be a shame to lose all the road access, but at least I'll get customers. Thank you. :)
---
I've recently been having a lot of fun keeping a revolving door of critters moving through my camp. Have now had a mongrel dog, radstag doe, rabbit, brahmin (random spawn), glowing deathclaw, chicken, mirelurk king, wolf, and I've currently got a megasloth. Got excited when a lone scorchbeast spawned in a random encounter spot the other day but they appear to still be untameable. :\\
---
Did you really make a Reddit account to shit on two video games?
---
We can see that you are posting an endless series of shitposts.  
---
Sure does. The most addictions  I’ve had simultaneously is 9. 
---
Counter theory, we're not popping enough balloons.
---
No, but I assume alot of people are though. And enough of them are that I get ganked and camped in adventure mode so why wouldnt I assume that a lvl 250 character with nothing left to do in the game would pass their time ganking people in a pvp mode. It seems obvious 
---
Yeah I have ran this event close to 50 times and never got a rare mask. But I'm a level 12 and that sloth has been dropping some good things for me lol
---
No. The premise of the post, right there in the title, is “survival mode”. Stop changing the conditions of the discussion to make you not wrong. 
---
hey
---
Just buy it from someone on fo76bazaar.
---
It is not worth returning.  Bethesda is doing bare-minimum to fix bugs and the new content has been very small.  Bethesda is not going to sink money into making the game good.
---
You didn’t state that anywhere in your OP, you titled it survival mode. Please be clear when and what you’re talking about so we can respond according. 
---
Once upon a time, completing the "Powering Up" events wouldn't actually provide bonus power to the boxes at the plant yards, meaning you'd have to build your own generators to power the fusion core processor. Good to hear they seem to work properly now, it was pretty disappointing to go through all that effort just to get basic event rewards.
---
Toxic Valley has tougher enemies than you'd think. Especially North and East of the spaceship.
---
I’ve only been playing a month but I’m almost certain they only expire at the start of each week when all the codes are reset. 
---
The game is more stable now and I can't attest to the quest sharing problem you were having since none of my friends play this game.   Since you already own it might as well jump back on to see if you enjoy it and if not uninstall and wait for future content.
---
I've done the event and had robots die before. When that happens you don't even get a mask, just a plan.
---
All it does is give you double basic resources like wood and steel. It doesn’t give you rare components.
---
Your clearly missing the mark, best of luck to you.
---
No, i played since the beta and from day 1 i made my build for player killing. Almost 200 hours, and i want to use it. No sent/assassin armor. Haven't found anyone on the normals servers that could kill me, and i want to use it. Open world fallout, every player you meet could be your enemy. A true apocalypse. Praise Talos.
---
No problem.  I have a camp above the billboard near Blackwater mine and it's a great area for crafting the new drinks.  There are tons of blackberries in the area, there is glowing sap, firecracker berries, lead, and other things of use if you look around.
---
You can get wanted for picking a lock of a cargo bot if it landed in somebody's CAMP area.
---
Ok thanks. :)
---
This. There are many ways to break the damage output you can do without needing a bloodied build. Ppl kill me with this shit.
---
When your building camps or crafting ammo or weapon, oh hell ya. Fastest way to get steelbis breaking a few dozen guns with scrapper.
---
Agreed.  I probably won't be playing because it's not separate.
---
That was my initial thought, but Bethesda just doesn't seem that smart. It seems more likely that they just have bad code like always
---
So higher ranks players cant help new players?
---
I agree with this. The items should be super rare so that not every person playing has the mask.
---
If you want it that bad just grind &amp; live in hope.
---
I feel the same way about 3* legendarys - should be rare as mutant hens teeth.
---
I'm a happy Blade of Batset regular user, and have totally been debating whether it's worth the grind to try to switch to Shishkebab for my main melee. Thanks for helping me decide!
---
It’s a fantastic source of plastic from laser rifles from supermutants. Also steel for ammo crafting.  
---
If even 1 robot dies you don't even get a mask, just a plan.
---
You can't base game numbers on Twitch streams. 
---

---
One of the banned players here, this blows for me because I would micromanage my inventory constantly to keep my stash under 500, even before the 800lb stash patch hit. But, this is the price I pay for helping my friend transfer his duped items :c
---
I have 8 different perk layouts. I switch between them as needed. I use that card in one of my crafting layouts. It's not the best card but does help in certain cases.
---
Allies are born through war WW1 and WW2 are real examples of this
---
Something to do with the recent Nuka shine alcohol most likely.
---
I think they need to revamp the ENTIRE trading system. It's awful. And adding a chat would be amazing
---
When it comes out in a decade haha.
---
Yee I saw you, damage was dealt, 18 minutes left that’s not too bad at all. Thanks for launching!
---
Doughnuts are cash grabs. 
---
Found it under the bridge by Harpers Ferry it's the one that's by the red rocket.
---
click on them. it tells you.
---
I don't wanna be that guy but was the original beta changed before release much? Doubt it will be different for Survival beta regardless
---
Great idea, how about adding wanted posters at the train station as well. This could be really cool
---
It's been moved up to the wall.
---
😆
---
Either that or their level and gear gets temporarily scales back
---
An chat feature would be great
---
You don't really know what the chance is. Do you have anything from Bethesda saying what the chance is? If so, post that link.
---
Otherwise you are just making up stuff, taking what other people say as fact, without any actual proof.
---
All because that fits what you've already decided MUST be the truth. And now you think things should change because of what you believe MUST be the TRUTH. That's what entitlement is about.
---
It's also about being so sure that you are always right, that anything that doesn't support what you think must be wrong.
---
My whole stance is, we don't have any information to know what's true or not. 
---
Also, I kind think anyone making a stink about not having an imaginary digital item in an imaginary game is kind of lame. But people are welcome to keep having their entitled tantrum. 
---
oh sorry
---
I just got back into it and I’m having a blast!

Is there a quad barrel fat man? That would be sooooo wasteful. Look, 4 mini nukes at once!

I assume you're not on PC, but if you do, I got you covered with my Assorted X01 Paint Replacer mod (on Nexus). There's a matte black enclave paintjob that might interest you -))
---
Don't seem to be able to see other comments on this?? send me a message instead untill I can find out why 
---
ok i know where you mean ty i am trying to tame at least one of everything possible 
---
I think u can just give him one u can find anywhere. You don’t have to craft it.  I’m pretty sure
---
If you think there people are unkillable you are wrong, stagger crits and they die easy
---
I'm pretty sure that Bethesda doesn't make all it's choices based on reddit alone. They most look for game issues and suggestions here. 
---
Mostly game issues, because this reddit is filled with complainers who over exaggerate. But still gives Bethesda an idea of where there are bugs. 
---
what are you looking to farm? 
---
Yes I remember this being a thing. For an hour of your time rushing around finding broken components and fighting off scorched. I usually run around hopped up on psycho chems with my super Sledge in hand and go ham.  It is nice to have decent rewards along with the fusion cores. Not everyone uses them but it's still nice. 
---
Of course there is still bugs in the game it has gotten significantly better since launch. 
---
I can make marsupial and give them out to cool players I come across... same with making deep pocket armor for newer players, helps them a ton! 
---
Which is *insanely stupid* game design!
---
Yet you wrote a book on the subject. 🤷‍♀️
---
Thats false. I server hop and got my mr winter mask at the ass end of the event
---
yep! everyone complains about pay to win game mechanics etc. and then they go and buy gear online. smh! Way to show devs that you wont buy pay to win games.  
---
I got my first at like level 112 or so, and a TSE at 156. Those were my only two explosive drops
---
Set up a base nearby and use some artillery grenades as well
---
Where do you find the response from Bethesda at?
---
Can anybody list all the fasnacht plans
---
Honestly Survival mode needs a matchmaking system, it could try to put you in sessions with players of similar level. It would be nice if there was some kind of gear score so the game could read that and also try to match you up with people of similar gear level.
---
There's no way, I doubt the next TES game will be out by then.  I would love to be wrong because Fallout is one of my favorite franchises.  I've loved 3, NV and 4 but I just don't see it coming out any time soon. 
---
Oh quit crying, you sniveling bitch. How many times has this happened to you? Imma guess zero. 
---
A good number of people in survival will be playing survival because they want to attack everyone, it's sort of the point.    
---
I have been attacked at low level by high level players or players with broken weapons.  People get kicks out of griefing people, that's just how it is.
---
I'm just trying to farm for the rarer guns like tse lever action and any tse or just some 3*stuff in general.
---
I just wanted to leave a comment and say that I had this error 3 times (and kept rebuilding in the same place) and I tried not moving my CAMP bench on the 4th try and it's been two days with no issues. So just place your bench down in a spot you're okay with and then don't move it around and you should be fine.
---
And thanks /u/ledoofus for posting about this because I was getting really frustrated!
---
I’ve battled her about 7 times in the last week and not one issue 
---
PLATINUM PAINBOW 💖✨🌈
---
If the average Joe can get one, it's not rare.
---
D- post, would not recommend
---
Chameleon armor does that, I use it.
---
Also, dropped loot bags have been following me around for three seconds before showing up. My bro and I have been calling them dingle berries.
---
That’s fair. If you can’t log in, it doesn’t matter how much stuff you have either
---
you could always keep going for inventory when player shops launch in april.
---
I'd love seasons, like Diablo.
---
Don't PvP.  
---
Don't build Workshops.  
---
Farming is a good source of food.  
---
Container objects near Vendors that high level players visit a lot are a great source of free plans.
---
Cool story bro
---
This should prolly be a separate post but what can you do with the tamed animals?  Will they follow you around?
---
Personally, I would say it's how you value your time. At this point is totally unclear how rare these mask are or if they even drop at all, so it's up to you. 
---
Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of RNG, but I know some people have more patience than me.
---
If 1 or 2 die you have an 85% chance of getting a mask. If 3 or 4 die you have 50% chance. None dying guarantees a mask.
---
Lost a nuke zone to this the other day. Pissed me off so much.
---
Y E S. 
---
Maybe add wanted posters at train stations!
---
As others said, it's not really possible. Bethesda already did a "clean" sweep and removed things that were excessively duped. They did not punish any individuals unless they were clearly proven to be duping, and left many people unpunished to minimize the impact this had on innocent players. There was no right way of going about this when so much time had passed and the problem was so far out of control, so I respect that they still made a priority and stuck to their decision.
---
The point though is that this is a one-time event. Most of the dupe methods are fixed and people are afraid of trying the others since bans are actually happening now. It is a clear problem that affects any players and items that were around back then, and which will hence affect players and items in survival mode if they transfer over. If they just force people to make new characters there, then this issue will be isolated. Nothing short of a server wipe will truly fix the duping issue in adventure mode, but not even we legitimate players want that. Comparing a cheated, exploited economy to how the game will be after years of playing is apples and oranges
---
No as soon as you tame them they bum-rush their way to your house and guard it.
---
I'm 99% sure that's now it works, but the MY CAMP placement is always in the Center of your build circle and my base takes up a 4x4 plot, meaning there will always be overlap and people always spawn inside my base. 
---
I must have just been one of the really unlucky ones then. Thanks for the info!
---
They put the pee pee in the Nuka Cola
---
Anytime thanks for the help
---
That kinda sucks was hoping they would follow you around and you could use them to fight other enemies 
---
I want more of the raider facepaints that have been added in leaks too 
---
eh im mostly lookin for paladin or elder rn
---
Any good place to farm tech data aside from enclave bunker?
---
This would be best imo, leaves both sides happy.
---
Yeah... sometimes takes me 5 minutes just to log in... crazy.
---
And yes, Helvetia... last night I'd arrive at the event after a server hop and would run around just seeing human players for 5-10 minutes without a single decoration being loaded...let alone the robots or mobs attacking.
---
Hmm - "invisible all the time" I understand that could be annoying.  
---
Just, make it at least *somehow possible* that I could do ***something***, some how, sneak up on him if I am patient, willing to take my time, and put a lot of character development time and focus on that being my main skill that I'm developing?
---
Does it make sense that berry mentats let him see me through multiple thick walls?
---
Does it makes sense that if I have fully maxed stealth skill, I'm crouched, I'm creeping slowly, and I'm behind stuff that he can just pop a chem and it's JUST as easy to see me as someone who has zero stealth, is out in the open, running around?
---
I’ve done it five times...I have five owl masks...for what it’s worth.
---
There are 13 of them in total; they all have placeholders in your camp build menu under wall decorations, floor decorations and misc.
---
The thread about the the poll one player made. It should still be on the front page of the sub. There's one Bethesda replied there confirming that his numbers are close and its working as intended.
---
2022 isn't soon though.. Here's what I've found on the inter-webs.
---
https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-5/fallout-5-release-date-locations-gameplay-story-companions-trailer-system-requirements
---
Yeh me too. I spend at least 2 hours when I'm on farming for *** weapons. I have a few good places. 
---
I have set up a shop next to Whitesprings station ready for player vending.  
---
when I started someone helped me out a lot with free stuff so if anyone under level 25 comes to the shop I make sure they get some free Stims ect. makes the game feel more friendly I think.

Yea it's not really fun grinding unless you got friends with ya
---
Tjx
---
I did it! Nuked the Fastnacht Parade. 
---
Since players are unkillable during the event, it did nothing. Probably the only time you can be at ground zero and survive it.
---
I'm going to go see Biv.
---
I guess im going to have to get one then. Whenever I go back to my camp there are some scorched on a bridge shooting their pipe pistols at my walls. They are out of range of the turrets they dont do that much damage but its annoying. 
---
Do you have a good mobile/cell plan for your phone to hotspot to?
---
I was 99% sure we were good. But never know what people are capable of.
---
Reddit makes up at most about 1% of the overall game population. Most people dont post things about cosmetics in games and likely most of the people who got the masks early dont know they are rare so why would they be showing off
---
I got the garland ones lol
---
They got your money and banned you. Nothing you can do about except show everyone how buttsore you are.....lol
---
I got the beret on my eighth parade.
---
I don't think either side is wrong either but I do think it's crazy to get upset when you can collect a purely cosmetic item it would make more sense imo to put that anger towards the crappy loot tables for legendary gear
---
Keep in mind future new players may want some of your extras, up to you if you gift or sell them.
---
Ur gun has recon scope 
---
I love dropping all my known plans off to low levels. I've got a 3* explosive level 30 weapon I'm waiting for the right person for. Sometimes we build for you, fusion reactors for example. To higher playera that help out, like holding an event vendor, I'll give them a choice of 1 free mutation as a thank you. Theres way more good players than bad.
---
I think we misunderstand what rare really means. If something is rare you should almost never see it, even if you are looking. The fact most games make rare items common place has changed how we view the word. I agree its probably not working as intended making it even rarer. I'm okay with that personally.
---
Lol, no way I'm going into survival mode with out twinking the hell out of my alt with my group in adventure mode.
---
If it isn't locked it's going to be a field day... they should lock servers by player level to be honest like once you hit 55 you can go to 55+ only servers 
---
Same shit happened to me still can fix the ID but ive not finished the quest as I cant get i to the dam
---
Or, more appropriately, 5pm PST
---
Sorry to hear you will miss out on the event, but you may already have all the drops there are for this event already. I get they claim there are other rare masks. I don’t believe they are actually attainable with the current drop rates. I personally have all the plans, two recipes, and the beret. Missing only the rarest masks. 
---
I really hope Nuclear Winter is as robust/unique as this 
---
I’m not sure what you are getting at.
---
Not at all, I get 150mb per month on my plan. Maybe I could buy some data $20 for 1 gig and hotspot my xbox to my phone. 
---
I dunno how much internet online gaming uses, I've always have unlimited.
---
I want a pack Brahman to help carry stuff on supply trips. 
---
They are hoping it will increase the chance of the rare masks
---
Under challenges in menu, they can add different things like that... they have hack a terminal while naked and drunk so why not something like this? 
---
Forcing everyone to start fresh creates an equal playing field? For what, like a week tops? People will power level themselves, farm up legendary gear all over again and anyone that joins in late to the game mode is easy pickings and there's nothing they can do about it. 
---
Tell us where Bethesda touched you
---
feel free to add me Alteron_command 
---
always up for more friends :) 
---
Launched my first nuke two days ago, Level 70. 
---
I spent about four hours stocking up on chems/meds/ammo, and then solo'd silo B right up to the control room where I kept getting my ass handed to me by those goddamned chrome bitches. 
---
I was about to give up, but I thought "one more try", and spawned back into my camp right next to Silo B, where I was greeted by a level 107 stranger. I asked him if he wanted to launch a nuke, told him I was already into the control room, and he came in and melee'd everything in sight while I respawned the five launch control officers. 
---
Nuke'd Whitesprings, and fast traveled to watch the sunrise, and as soon as the bomb dropped my 1 year old woke up, so I didn't get to participate in the nuke zone. But I leveled up three times in 20 minutes, so not bad I guess. 
---
I do it when it pops up, I always figure when I get a dupe mask I can see if everyone else needs it. I like seeing everyone together and hope we get more of this kinda stuff just because of that. I'd like to get the masks but they were said to be rare, unfortunate insanely rare obviously. There's always next fastsnatch!
---
\*An\* Ominous Message
---
I didn’t see it on Xbox last night 
---
Sure why not?
---
Same thing for me, except I hit someone’s damn camp they set up at the back doors of the Whitesprings golf club house. I HATE people who do that! 
---
As another person said - click on them &amp; it will give you details on what to complete.
---
One of hit rock bottom challenges is build 25 items at red rocket work bench, I went there, got the work bench and built 25+ flamingos just to complete this.
---
Placement could be why. You don’t want to just randomly place the nuke. You want site V9 clear and away from radiation. I do roughly 9k damage per hit to the queen but I refuse to show up if it’s an improperly placed nuke. That could be a reason why. Or it could just be event hoppers. I’d personally pick the queen over the mask event. 
---
He almost always requires you to “interact” with him multiple times to get it. I always visit him, hit E, wait 15 seconds, hit E again, wait 15, hit E again and then finally get the quest.
---
Yeah, unlucky. You're right though that letting robots die is *only* bad, it doesn't change the loot list, just whether or not the loot list gets looked at.
---
Cool idea, but there's a ton of other things I'd prefer fixed first. 😂
---
I had the same problem and the wiki is vague.  They only bloom at night.
---
Ok I will 
---
Hundreds are server hopping the Nuka Paint op for XO-1 and the parade... 
---
Nuka paint deals should be a one time gig or at least a week long respawn so others wouldn’t have to hop. 
---
I would like to just be able to get a shot on it. All but once, it gets one shot by someone and no one else gets any loot.
---
So how many have u seen in game then? Huh
---
would be interesting if the made a pipboy app to go with it like they did for 4.
---
Oh well that's good to know! Most events only award rewards at the "ass end" of the events though.. idk when else you could've gotten it 
---
Not the quad legendary prefix, but rather the four barrel mod you can get. But with the quad prefix, you could fire sixteen rockets which would be incredible 
---
my buddy had a power plant workshop, got the defend from sheepsquatch notification... it was scorched
---
it was disappointing but i'm still excited though 
---
You can kill them if they refuse to move. 
---
There's already so many search effects though, and I honestly think we eventually need more food/drink perks for flavor. Right now it's either Cannibalism or kinky dog man
---
It's 5 days away.  Why not just let it release how they intended and see what people think first?
---
My god, this is a whiny bunch.
---
That's mostly what I'm in it for now. If I see everyone bunched up I know they're past the fetch quest part and I'll hop over if I'm nearby to enjoy some company. My days of server hopping are over though. Maybe I'll be one of the lucky few, but I certainly won't be losing any sleep over it!
---
We are DEFINITELY popping enough balloons ;)
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
At 4.6K a pop, you're really relying on killing her before she kills you, right?  I don't know how one could do it in just a Hazmat Suit.  She thwacks me with the wings all the time and it does quite a bit of damage.  The safe spot is to try to stay behind her, but you don't always have that option depending on how she skitters around.
---
5 o'clock is drinkin time, silly
---
Once you enter the zone and try to take the workshop, you're open to PvP with that person
---
BUT only if they are there, or once they enter that zone.
---
Then if they leave the zone after that, they're still fair game.
---
HOWEVER that might be tricky to work out.
---
I don't though, only owl, witch, and skeleton man. I still need the solider and giant.
---
Totally agree with regard to the drop rates though. Pretty damn ridiculous.
---
I want to point out that people who respond to this thread/poll are people who are concerned/thinking about it.  Potentially only the people who haven’t received the rare masks.  It’s possible that people who did receive the mask might not even comment at all considering the demands for proof etc.   A better poll would be asking which masks people got.  
---
This game mode isn’t intended for a brand new character. It’s made as an end game higher difficulty. Once you find yourself bored of adventure you go into survival. Starting a new character would set every one up to be spawn camped at the vault. 
---
Would you mind taking more pics or a video? I'm trying to build this but can't figure out the back side - outside and inside
---
Lmao that reminds me of my story. I picked a lock of a safe on the edge of a workshop WHILE SOMEBODY WAS TAKING IT (not yet taken) and it still gave me a bounty. I logged off and came back, tried desperately to get rid of as much spare weight as I could to fit junk in my stash, ended up crafting hundreds of marine masks just to use up the rest. I was surprised nobody killed me by then. I found a random player and had to beg him to kill me. Then the damage bug triggered...he unloaded three full clips of his combat rifle on me and it didn't do anything, so he had to melee me to death. It was a relatively low level player in excavator armor, I was worried he might have thought I was cheating and wanted him to test my invincibility
---
1Gb should be enough for several days play if not more.
---
I use my phone at home on my ps4 (in Australia &amp; my phone connection is 10 times faster than my home adsl)
---
You can monitor the usage easily on android phones. If you grab the $20 package test for 20 minutes taking note of usage before you start playing &amp; then after you have played for 20 minutes.
---
So you only care about yourself. Got it. You can stop grandstanding now. 
---
Add me gofukyurslf326 I grind similar weapons but im happy with anything I can sell
---
If so... I'll be making a new character I guess. 
---
Those are for a seasonal event like Fasnacht where players hold the booths to try to get elected president or senator or whatever. Like Fasnacht a lot of the game files were present at launch and are just inactive. The rewards in the enclave bunker include a sick ass power armor paint and some other cosmetic goodies. The currency you get for winning the quest is "presidential seals". I don't know if anyone has glitched into the presidential suite in the bunker recently. but last time they did the vendor was already up and running, there was just no way to get the seals.
---
which one is the skeleton man?
---
Please post what platform you’re on?
---
In my experience the majority of players are bad. I guess most PS4 players are just A holes.
---
I'll add you 
---
&gt; Raiders make other peoples lifes living hell even if they are pacifists.
---
Yes, and I'm thrilled to see that play style die in adventure mode.
---
You don't experience frame drops and lag on X? I play on X too, but sometimes (while sprinting or shooting) I have heavy frame drops. 
---
Yeah, it’s the game. I’m currently loading into the white springs to deposit the junk of someone who griefs using sentinel and bloodied build. Bethesda pls nerf Sentinel and bloodied
---
If you don't like playing quit playing or quit complaining 
---
I'll trade ya 12 owls for a jester.
---
It won't. Nukes are not tied to the chances. There's post on that subject here. And the chance to get one is very rare. Like one in ten thousand
---
This is actually awesome news. I'm in NZ and we'll have ADSL until the fibre kicks in. The worst friggin time to have bad internet.
---
Good point.  Also, the developers have a vision for this mode.  I realize feedback is important but being as it releases Tuesday, we should try it first then provide our opinions.
---
Name your price price if you find a rare. I don't think they are available just yet. 
---
Please explain this, do you mean the more technical data you turn in, the *less* likely you are each time to get a rare drop? That is painful news.
---
Whiskey? Ha, Western fool, Vodka is true Slav's drink! You Capitalist fools have been tricked by your government and their propaganda into thinking that whiskey is best drink!
---
And as you want it this would only be fair for people that immediately get into the game. 
---
What happens to all of the people that start late and log into the mode weeks or months later and have to deal with all of the power leveled characters that have been farming legendary gear all of that time? They just have to suck it up and get good because a fair and equal start only had to apply when the mode first opened? 
---
If you want no one to have an unfair advantage you shouldn't be demanding the mode require new characters, you should be demanding monthly if not weekly resets. 
---
Lmfao! I bet! Lol I have so many owls, giants, soldiers,  and witch masks, it's ridiculous 
---
If I have a .22 rifle and a .22 pistol, are they the same?
---
It's the toothy man mask sorry, reminds me of a skeleton face. 
---
I've seen Old man winter
---
I’m having a real hard time with this. I was super pumped for survival, thinking it would just be a more brutal and immersive role play-like experience. Now it’s some cheesy Deathmatch mode laid on top of the normal game. I mean a leaderboard? Really??
---
And now they have these limited-time rewards that will me so OP and meta-necessary if it complements your build? So I go from looking forward to Survival, to not liking it and figuring I’ll pass on it, to now dreading that I’ll actually HAVE to play it if I want these rewards. 
---
Like I was gonna start a new character, keep it on the level with others starting fresh on Survival. But now I have to bring in my Adventure Rifleman to get that lever-action. 
---
Also someone posted the sun mask on Twitter.  Only seen Old man winter in game play though
---
After patch 7..... 
---
LMG. Almost the same damage per Bullet as a 50cal, with twice the fire rate and better accuracy. I use it as a long range shotgun. If it weren’t for the expensive to craft ammo, it’d be the only gun I’d use,
---
That's true, I hope that article is right and we can get our hands on 5 sooner than later. 
---
I have yet to see an event with less than 15 participants. If masks aren’t dropping, then stop letting the bots get killed. 
---
Exactly. Every one with the mindset of a new separate character will soon find it tha it’s worse than having an existing one carry over. Every one who plays the same day it launches will be okay. But even if you make a new survival character the following weekend you will get destroyed by people five levels higher because they are camped up at flatwoods.  By carrying over a character from adventure gives every one a fair start. No one joins in until they feel like they are ready. 
---
Well only took me 12 events to get mine. Just saying when it happened. How many events did it take you to get your rare mask?
---
Check out an LMG after patch 7. Almost the same damage per bullet, about twice the RoF, and better accuracy. 
---
The ADSL should be sufficient, maybe with some extra lag. Mine worked ok but why use it when I have a decent amount of data on my phone that is so much quicker.
---
I'm on PS4, can I ad you as a friend so I know when you're on?
---
Exactly how I feel with them, they’re overpriced
---
But your worries are literally amplified in a month with the big picture of not having character transfers.  Imagine if in WoW PvP servers any member of either faction could kill you.  Sure, itd be okay when it started but in a month when people are capped good luck starting a new character.  What you're worried about literally just gets worse if people can't level without worrying about a level 100 who has been in survival since day one camping Flatwoods.  I'd argue that is the short sighted choice.
---
I literally said I don't want to lock existing players or characters out from enjoying the new mode. How is that me only caring about myself? 
---
The option I'm suggesting is so that everyone can play how they want without impacting each other. 
---
Weird I’m built in the same spot (Underground though) No issues here!
---
It's just a problem in PVP when players have OP armor and something like TSE Gatling Gun, where they don't have to hit me, they just shoot NEAR me and I die, but even if I get 4 - 5 direct hits and a Nuka Grenade Quantum on them, they're not even close to dead.  
---
This game lets you make your character too OP and unbalancing - there should not be such an extreme range of power from combining (exploiting) certain combos of perks + stuff etc. 
---
Everyone should at least have a SLIGHT chance of winning a 1 vs 1 in terms of how powerful one character is vs another, even if they might not have the skill needed to pull off the win...
---
Early on in the game before I had Power Armor a somewhat higher level dude came and kicked my ass when I took had a workshop.  At first I was angry at how easy he could kill me, but then, I decided to find a hiding spot with good cover, laid out a few mines, and crouched in the darkness until he came around the corner - I hit him with my Black Powder rifle w/the bonus from sneak attack + the chem I had taken and it took like 90% of his health, one of the mines had hurt him a little right before that too, so he was startled, shaken, and just about dead, all I had to do was hit him one more time.  He then got upset and left, having come in as the stronger character at first.
---
If you are willing to be patient, out think your enemy, and carefully carry out a plan, you should always at least have that ***possibility*** of successful revenge.
---
By allowing characters to become far too OP, and making stealth completely usless in PVP (either they can see you on the map, in their hud, or they can pop Berry Mentats - whatever, somehow even my maxed out stealth and very high agility - I was still somehow plain as day to him and though I kept trying to come in at him through different doorways, EVERY TIME he was looking right in my direction waiting for me - too frustrating because he was simply too powerful to beat head on.
---
One time I even hit him at least five times w/my Legendary TSE rifle, not even half way killed him :(
---
It was like a mosquito, and he could just IGNORE my attacks - ***stupid***.  Definately  flaw in this game which in many other ways is tons of fun and great to play.
---
I didn’t even know you could click on them 
---
I honestly didn’t even know I could do this 
---
Plus I would think you can spawn where your camp is.  So you could enter the server and stay at your camp. Because I also see that if people are all creating new toons, Vault 76 will be a bloodbath.  People will constantly get killed in front of the vault.  There could very well be turret bases waiting to greet you in the forest.
---
Ghouls drop more Radaway than you can eat if you make 4x diluted from each with the Chemist perk. Super Duper means 30% of the time that actually yields 8. As soon as I can I clear the rads using Pharmacist for more efficacy. I don't use power armour unless Whitespring has been nuked. I have around 150 diluted currently.
---
Please shut the hell up about this, you and the other 10 people constantly crying, no one wants to regrind the fucking game again, just because you can doesn’t mean others can.
---
Wait, I thought op said whores. My bad.
---
I was fortunate enough to do the event solo last night and it was still just as easy, if not easier than having other people. 
---
They're in every mix, can't help that. I've met a lot of cool people, helped a lot of scared lower level players too. 
---
the only mask i've seen that interests me remotely is the skull mask. unfortunately, i've yet to hear about anyone who has gotten one of these. 
---
if anyone hears otherwise, i hope they post it on here...i'm kinda irritated by the drop rates, but the event is fun enough that i don't care too much. just wish there was more i could do to hedge my bets. 
---
Yeah. We know your able to get it and all that but don’t make the price ridiculous like 10k.......
---
yup there are gonna be people who either couldnt play this week or start playing after that will buy those for sure
---
Wish I could find high levels like this. Everyone on Xbox is just trying to kill my Lvl 24 character with the same shitty Bloodied and Sentinel Build.
---
What do you even think I said? 😂
---
I personally don't think forcing everyone to restart would solve the power imbalance. I got a character to level 50 over the course of a week, people will have their new one-shot builds ready before the beta has seen a few days. 
---
Idk about that, as a melee i cant even take two steps towards anything without it already being dead so all i can do is stand around and wait for slothy boi
---
The "dupe economy" is dead. There's nobody with a stack of 10,000 two-shot explosive .50 caliber machine guns any more, everybody who was doing that had their extras deleted and most were flat-out banned.
---
You know who else thinks it's a good idea to bring other people down to make things "fair" so that they can get ahead? Communists, that's who.
---
If you *really* want that two-shot explosive god-tier weapon, then make a post in one of the various FO76 market subreddits and buy one like a REAL American would!
---
That breaks the 4th wall
---
YEEEESSSSSSSS!!!
---
So I have been running this event quite often and, while I have not gotten any of the legendary masks, there have been a few times where I will get, as a reward, a leveled 1\* legendary armor piece.  
---
Here is my theory: That leveled 1\* legendary armor piece was supposed to be one of the legendary masks and Bethesda messed that part up. Any thoughts on this?
---
no only problem i have so far on xbox is takes forever for everything to load in the town when i first travel there
---
If you're on xbox, I'll come drop you a shovel and some hand sanitizer. Or maybe some balloons.
---
I wouldn’t mind if it was 3*
---
I've played the game pretty much everyday since the week after launch.  My annoyance with it comes and goes.  Some days are great.  Others are like today.  But the overarching issue at this point is that I don't have much to strive for these days.  My character has reached a point of contentment.  She's not perfect by any stretch, but she can take what the game throws at her.  I can make incremental improvements if I cared, but I can't say I do.
---
Or they could just buy the gear from the marketplace anyway and transfer it to their new character. 
---
If your not allowed to spawn in where your camp is, then count of people racking up kills around Vault 76.  Turret bases in the forest.
---
You mean the pirate mask, right?  That one is bad ass
---
I mean, considering the crashes and disconnects the game pretty much already does that by itself.
---
Probably but even then, according to his rough math, a metric crap ton of players across all platforms should've received something. 4 possible instances does not a hypothesis make. Plus someone would've posted a video or more photos saying they've gotten one
---
Can't you just rebuild whatever someone destroys? Like walk up to what's been destroyed and hit "rebuild" or "repair" whatever it says :P
---
Yes, I understand every one who thinks it will be a good idea they want a fair experience. But the only fair experience is by having every one level up and gear up in adventure if you enter survival before level 50 without a good base setup and good gear your an idiot. It is a hardcore survival game mode not a stroll in the park you will be killed if your a low level trying to start a new game. I’d actually like for them to make survival mode only available to characters who are level 50 so no one can complain that an enemy character is too strong. All while they are level 5 and died to a level 200.  
---
I never used that app but read dead II has a really cool app with a live map in it. I think that would be neat.
---
Much easier to dump the mask it gets annoying seeing 8 of the same mask in my inventory lol at one point I haved 10 giant 6 soldier 6 owl 8 witches 3 toothy 
---
How many mask are there
---
I'm rifle /sneak build so all I had to do with the mutant's was stand on a roof with my handmade
---
What?
---
Having everyone create new characters will turn the area around Vault 76 into a killing field.  If you die there, you only respawn there.  Infinite kills basically.  Having existing toons brought in means I spawn at my camp and with a fighting chance.
---
The idea that any of the players here, even those that enjoy the game will be playing “next time” is kind of a joke.  Seems unrealistic to me to expect over a year of longevity on this game.
---
Mine is Glant17 but they always think the L is an I so they say Giant17. 
---
Who is Biv?
---
I'm sure it doesn't remove stealthboys. But if they are using chameleon it means their sentinel isn't working since they are crouched. 
---
I really need to switch to a pistol build, this laser rifle is killing me.
---
Like they are literally doing next week.  Along with updates to pacifist. 
---
yea well i could easily make 10k  caps in the amount of time it takes to find one of the other paint jobs so yes its worth that
---
Mine is propj101
---
It was originally pro pj 101, pj being my nickname from my mom but she is the only one that calls me it and i find it weird if anyone else did so... 
---
Everyone calls me prop j 101, and im fine with it
---
Yeah.
---
Without resolving the more glaring design contradictions in the base, releasing a new mode is overeager. This game's development has been slanted toward production instead of refinement and it's really sad that the studio depends on a few reddit users to point out super obvious shit like this.
---
you on pc? this sucks, I'll give you my soldier mask free of charge
---
Berry still doesn't allow you to target them in vats.. 
---
I have a feeling you're right. I think they're going to change the drop rates. half way through and all the "rare" masks will be dropping like crazy. Gives us a reason to play through the whole week and not just 2 days until you've collected every mask. 
---
Those are the only 2 recipes I ever get from the event I can give you mine later if you want. I always get those.
---
I've been getting that too. Do you know how long the Event takes to refresh? I spent a couple of hours online tonight and wasn't able to finish it a single time. I must be having bad luck with server lol.
---
Are you on PS4???
---
Cant find ur profile
---
Everyone gets a fair start? I disagree, the people without ridiculously OP One shot kill weapons disagree. The only fair start is to force the creation of a new character without the carry over. No one besides the people who have the most god tier items and build carried over from adventure mode are going to enjoy survival. What is the point of playing if I know my character that I made in BETA is not going to stack up to someone who went and duped OP weapons and copied a youtubers one shot build? Forcing new characters with at the very least brackets based on levels is the only way to keep the game balanced. I was extremely happy hearing about Survival originally. But I can't be bothered to even try it out if I already am able to see the outcome.
---
After reading these results I may stop trying for it then. I am completely wasting my time attempting the improbable.
---
Yeah my GT is Glant17
---
Oh I dunno. I was in WS last weekend, minding my own business and clearing out the condos when two pests decided to hound me from one end to the other, shooting me with explosive rounds. I have a gigantic health bar, but I did eventually have to use a stimpak to keep my health from going down too much. I could see how if I was a much lower level that the slap damage could have killed me fairly quickly.
---
You will be able to when you progress through the story! Have fun!
---
You’re a god! When can you be on? I have like 4 masks already so I’m fine on those but I really want the food
---
*lol* Tryna copy huh?! 
---
Very big mistake. But then again, after about 2 weeks of playing new players would be at a disadvantage to players who started off rip, creating an endless loop
---
I love this game like everyone here. I admit I'm addicted and all the issues we/I whine about are for the most part temporary and fixable.  
---
I have no worries that BSG will fix a lot of the balance, dupers, griefers, and balance issues given time.  Better not to rush into some of those things.  BUT the servers are utterly unreliable and extremely slow.  It's not the player's PC, XBox or Playstation - It's the servers.  
---
i just server hop till i find one thats going 
---
Xbox, but that's very kind, thank you :)
---
I sure hope this isn’t some stunt to sell them in the Atom store later.
---
Haha
---
If we're now dropping stuff from Aid then it looks like I'm going never playing this mode, especially if it's a percentage drop and not a set number. Thanks to Traveling Pharmacy I've been able to hoard what would otherwise be over 1600lbs of chems and no way in hell I'm putting any of that on the line. 
---
what platform?
---
I can probably get on in an hour and I should be on almost all day tomorrow.
---
I think mine fairly easy. Sometimes I spell it cyphon too.
---
I farm stealthboys too so I do this. Its really expensive.

Submit tech data &gt; enclave bunker &gt; buy stealthboy &gt; find technical data &gt; server hop &gt; submit tech data 
---
Provided Remote Play works I can do an hour lol. Just let me know when 
---
At this point who cares that the devs have a vision for this mode? Shouldn't they be more focused on giving us the game we want now? I was one of the very few that wanted and was excited for 76. Nobody else wanted the game and if they keep making bonehead decisions like this: everyone who didn't want this game is going to be right. We the consumers should be the ones dictating the direction of the game so there is actually a reason for more people to come play it.
---
Ps4
---
You could throw them in your stash.
---
Aight
---
Yes lol
---
But I am sure if folks did get it...they would be bragging. Not one brag says it all.
---
They probably weren’t obtained legitimately.
---
Are you playing on PC? I struggling to get anything on Xbox. Even with 5 level 100+ players we were failing the quest due to lag spikes and most of the time the server crashed before we could finish the parade. So far I only have owls and a couple of recipes.
---
Exactly this, it isn't a fresh start to put everyone on an even playing field, it's a fresh start to get away from the massive amounts of OP gear that made its way into the game from exploits. 
---
Frankly when the Survival mode goes live I want to see an equally locked pve only mode. One where you can't even target other players. If you shoot at them, the bullets go through them which would stop griefing with explosives and such things. No contesting work shops... which mostly doesn't even happen now. If someone else has the workshop you want 99% of the time people just server hop until they can grab it. Even then, most people aren't bothering with workshops anymore, their value has been stripped too heavily.
---
I just think adventure mode has been stripped of any value. This game (to me) gains its value as a farming game, much like PoE, diablo or even like the division. With the mass amounts of duping and all the early power that was distributed among the masses, it made all the work I put into my build lose value and power relative to my fellow players. Before the dupes going out heavily, every nuke zone I was in people were impressed with how strong my toon was. Then suddenly all at once I was the weaker player. 
---
It's not a huge deal in pve, at best it's a nuisance because it makes things harder to tag when someone blows up waves of mobs in seconds. But in pvp it's a pretty huge fucking problem that someone like myself who is totally self found can't compete with someone who bought dupes for cheap.
---
Same thing happened earlier when I was playing. Someone nuked the Queen, two people showed up, neither of them was the one who launched the nuke 😆. I dropped in and mowed down a bunch of the creatures, didn’t bother with the Queen though. 
---
I suppose, though I never really seem to have trouble getting steel. Now Lead on the other hand is the one I have trouble finding for ammo crafting. If the weights at the hotel, VTU, or the Charleston FD have all been looted then I gotta search for loot. 
---
Workshops are a definitive no go for me since the game still crashes or disconnects too often for me to go through the hassle of claiming, building, and defending it all to get about 15-20 lead at the most until the game or servers decide to suddenly stop working.
---
I wish Scrapper had another level to it for more advanced resources or at least gave us practical things like screws.
---
I'll definitely try that tomorrow. thanks.
---
We don’t have a clue
---
He’s talking about the rare masks dude
---
yup put it on the main menu and make people answer a question every time they log in (do it during loading or something to give people something to do assuming that the loading screen can take it)
---
Also you shouldn't just discard Reddit and twitter and the like, you just need to not take them as mandates from heaven and just skim off the good bits rather than allowing us to dictate everything. :P
---
On the other hand i'm sure if Bethesda had handed off to the mod community by now things would be much better and likely allow each person or sever to find its own niche rather than trying to have everyone be happy with the same thing.
---
Its actually possible to have a multitude of options on how fallout 76 works if discrete individual severs with their own mod list curated by the owner/operator/mad mod king (whatever you wanna call them really) this allows for things like individual Player character's bound to severs (and i guess an option to allow you to take a pc from sever to sever assuming the mod stuff allows for it you might have to clean your inventory from any modded items that wouldn't exist on the new sever but that is getting way ahead of myself on that one.) either way going down the mod option allow everyone to have their cake and eat it and if you can't find the "right" mod list you just make your own. this means if some people want to insist on a fresh start to join their pvp sever they can insist on it and if someone wants to take his god level toon s/he's been running since the start to new places then they can assuming someone as a sever set up to allow it.
---
Add to that the speed and completeness of the unofficial patch mods for the rest of the morrowind/oblivion/skyrim games Bethesda could do with taking some notes from those guys.
---
Very true!
---
Well maybe if was elder then yeah. Officer should be around 6k while paladin should be 7k.
---
I used every trick I knew to pull it all off.
---
Which part were you trying to replicate? 
---
You have the same opportunity as they do. If you both start brand new characters they will still build the same exact build buy they same duped weapons and still be op. Instead you will be at such a massive disadvantage because now you can’t even get out of flatwoods because your being beaten to death by characters who made a new character a day before you. What about people who make new characters on the weekend who didn’t get to play on release? They will be 4 day behind. plenty of time to be at a massive disadvantage. Only now they have zero hope of catching up by playing in adventure mode. 
---
Folks are sharing duplicate rewards with fellow marchers who might not have gotten them yet. It's really been heartwarming to see such festive generosity. Sometimes nobody wants yet another toothy man mask (the market is really flooded with the common stuff, to be honest) so if you want to clutter up your stash and try to make bank off them later that's your business, just don't be a douche and snatch away someone else's sunshine for a few caps. Winter is over. Look at it this way, every mask thrown away only increases the future value of the others. By giving up what they don't really need they're doing everyone a favor. Merry Fasnacht!
---
Maybe it increases chances
---
Pretty much self-explanatory. A thumb who is panicked. Like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPT58mxlo1M
---
I have everything built I just can't figure out where the 4th and 6th picture fit in. I can't see where those connect to the others
---
I'm on XBox.. I have yet to get a recipe,  but I've gotten lots of CAMP plans, including the Old Man Winter Effigy (I believe it's the burning man thing.. I haven't read it yet). It's definitely been lagging though, but no server crashes yet. However,  did the event a few times with noobs who all stand around &amp; failed because the couldn't protect the bots properly. Smdh...
---
A 0.03% drop rate *might* be acceptable if we could repeat the event for 10 years... but a week? Talk about slap damage! You been drinking straight paint?  You know that stuff has lead in it.
---
I hate to break it to ya, but nobody's gonna participate in the next limited event. GG
---
Send me some pics? 
---
Yeah that’s cool
---
I know this is probably very obvious but what is Exe?
---
Naw, I was in the event with dude who got old man winter... He put it on right after we finished.  So, it is obtainable. RNG force was definitely on his side lol
---
I don't mean doing it indiscriminately. I'm only in favor of it if Bethesda has a way of tracking items and identifying items that are the result of duping.  Many people here assume that Bethesda doesn't have that capability. Well, maybe they don't, but I'd like to know what this assumption is based on.
---
And I just wore out my guns
---
I'm honestly fine with some things just being super rare.  Stuff that even dedicated grinders can't get just by investing the time feels kind of cool to me, I dunno 
---
If your internet isn't up in time I will be happy to sell you the ones your missing if I have extras. Which ones?
---
Part of I am become death quest .... finding extra information to decrypt nuke codes
---
I'm still playing this, close to 400 hours.  I'm fine with the mode starting the way it is.  Which it can evolve over time.  So I'm fine with it.  Not that it matters, it's already finalizing.  Either play it or don't. 
---
I've failed a couple of times due to noobs too. They always seem to forget about the wolves.
---
Do you have more duplicates of either recipe? I’ve been grinding for them but haven’t gotten either yet. 
---
Same name, or do you want me to PM you about it?
---
&gt;  hopefully it's not too lopsided
---
I've 1 shot everyone I've ever tried to kill, which I admit is pretty limited. Still those were end game geared people. A lowbie who's yet to get any real legendary gear ... well I feel sorry for that person.
---
Hell yeah, i think survival mode is not ready, too. Balance and optimize was not ready.  
---
I'm pretty sure it's the code for the door in Tanagra town. Not 100% sure though.
---
Oh man, im adding you when i log on later on tonight. Kudos for the great work! I have a bunch of plans i can give you as well, i usually collect them and give em to low levels.
---
Your not the only one who wanted fallout 76 you spoiled brat thinking that you control the game your one out of a million who want survival to suck if you dont like the way this games going stop playing
---
The masks =\= the rare masks. 
---
Man, that sucks.  I've only run into a couple people who weren't totally super friendly on PC.  Even the hostile players were hostile in a pretty fair kind of way.
---
Hell, today I had an amazing guy throw in an anti-armor Western pistol when I bought 3 marsupial serums for 600 caps.  All he wanted was one of my extra toothy man masks. A true hero.
---
I ran into a Mr. Gusty selling lemonade. He had 200 caps and you could trade with him.
---
No, but I found extensive unofficial fallout-themed playlists searching Spotify -
---
So I’ve been randomizing through them like a mega fallouts pandora station 
---
on a bluetooth speaker next to the tv. I really should craft a radio case for it.
---
I must have done that a long time ago but thanks this was killing me. 
---
&gt; Here is a new mode, you can do all the thing again that you already by now have done twice.".
---
Just twice? I've already done it 5 times. Not a valid complaint.
---
They wouldn't be able to bring the same duped weapons if the characters were locked to that specific mode. The builds are not the issue.. the weapons that are all OP and coming from adventure are. If you spawn in an you can't make it out of Flatwoods then that's your issue. If this is an issue then keep PVP until level 5 off like the base game to give everyone atleast a chance to get out of the starting area. Or just until the completion of the first quest outside of the vault. The bracket idea for people to be set in similar leveled servers would help out anyone who is unfortunate enough to have a later start.
---
Exactly.  It does reach a point, eventually, where you finally stop bothering with the event.  I stopped doing the "Distant Thunder" event, for example because I don't need 100 plans or T60 motion assisted servos or another piece of T51b power armor and it honestly feels like I have no chance of getting anything else. 
---
The way events work in this game is a shining example of demotivation. 
---
It’s obviously the rare masks, quit being stupid.
---
That evidence assumes that everyone that plays the game posts on Reddit.
---
Not actual evidence.
---
Never mind there are 8 Mask
---
Then it is going to fail and it is unfortunate to see it that way. If I am wrong then I will 100% admit it and be joyful to be wrong. But i truly don't feel they are doing the right thing releasing the mode in the state they intend it to be.
---
What is the perks
---
I've received Knight (BOS 2) and Knight CPT (BOS 4).  So no, not in order.
---
You may need to trade to get the others. I think they did that on purpose to make the community come together.
---
Your naive to think that duping is resolved or that t won’t happen all over again. You fail to see the future problems with your idea. I can now see you are basing your judgement of the game mode based on feelings and not logic so I will no longer try and convince you with logic. Have a good day. 
---
I'll wait for Bethesda to make party hats. Then I will save them.
---
Probably executioner
---
Ad Victoriam! 
---
Railway Rifle?
---
we runescape now
---
Railway Rifle 
---
Its kinda weird if some masks are unobtainable and Fallout 76s Twitter sponsored a photo of players in those masks....
---
That's very kind, thanks. I missing soldier currently. I will probably play tonight after work and see if I can get one or both. 
---
At this point I don't think the "rare" masks are worth anyone's time. I won't chase those unless they change the drop rates because they'll be killer expensive.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s the railway rifle. You can also hear the sound coming from construction protections, who have this as their primary weapon. 
---
I’d advise not nuking it cause it only raises some of the enemy lvls also if you need to collect intestines good luck since animals can’t spawn in nuked zones 
---
Sounds good! I’ll be on again in about 8-10 hours. 
---
I'm one of maybe a few thousand that were on board with the Online no NPC Fallout idea. You resorted to name calling which is actually hilarious and I hope you grow out of that habit. I want survival to be this games claim to fame but with the current idea that Bethesda has in place I just can't see it happening. How do you bring people back to your game? Oh that's right, you create a mode that only the people who have been playing the game nonstop are going to get any fun out of.
---
So you need soldier and giant?
---
Thank you
---
You are exactly what I am talking about. This is a fine event. I'm sure there will be better ones in the future. If you do it a few times a day and get a few  different rewards, for most, that is fine. 
---
Its just this vocal bunch of players who grind it non stop who ste upset that the ultra rare drops are just that. Very very rare. 
---
To think the dev's should 'have their throats ripped out' is pretty messed up to me. It's just an even with some masks. Why are you so butthurt?
---
Hawk-X51. I haven't noticed a problem. If you're having trouble pronouncing it just punch yourself in the throat. Not because it'll help, but because you're stupid and you deserve it.
---
That's fine by my, I've met a lot of great people in my escapades to "collect all the cosmetics" once I'd run out of actual gameplay.
---
Might have already been said but why not try disableing all legendary effects for survival mode.  Seems like it would be a good way to balance pvp.  Only you, your wits and a dream.
---
The whole server knew not to go to the butcherer 
---
😀
---
It tends to be their final solution.
---
I'll see myself out...
---
Thanks, that was really informative
---
Yeah, I don't see a problem with that. It would give higher levels more of an incentive to help newer players.
---
Or shut up, get what luck gives you and move on.
---
Waaaa
---
I had a logical rebuttal to every point you tried to make and you came back with trying to call me naive and insult me with the most grand of exits used only by people who know they have been defeated. YIKES
---
Ah, thanks. Is that a pretty good gun? I may have to try to get one of those if so.
---
At this point yeah. I get of work in 15 mins and will likely play tonight. It's not exactly the funnest quest to repeat, means to an end. Otherwise I will have to trade once I get back online.
---
PC
---
Love it!
---
Well actually it would only work if ppl so happen to have some intestines saved up from a past event
---
Ok I'll keep giant and soldier in mind and I'll keep you posted just send me a message when u get internet back.
---
My melee character killed his 1st 3 star (a protectron) and it blew up in his face, killing him and making its and all the other bodies disappear, so I got nothing for the effort.
---
Drink more of the koolaid. There is something wrong with the event and folks like u who ass kiss the devs are the reason it wont be fixed.
---
Are you having a bad day?
---
true dat lol
---
I don’t actually think they take ideas posted here as the be all final decision (I worded that weird I hope you get my point. Lol). But really if you add all the social media it adds up to a small sample of the player base voicing what they want. I think an ingame survey would allow them to get the bigger picture. 
---
I believe that Bethesda has planned to let people take current toons to survival and switch between the 2 freely since the beginning when it was first announced. 
---
But I do think if they had polled the player base on what is actually wanted they would get a lot more praise, and a lot less back lash. I mean they constantly tell us they want the community to help shape the game, yet I have yet to see anything that really shows they listen. But that is a separate issue. 
---
You're too kind, thank you!
---
#1 thing to dupe......are you kidding me. Forget that 3* super op gun, I want a useless mask that offers no strategic advantage. What are you smokin......lol
---
Boiled water and abraxo cleaner!
---
Runescape was a very successful game and still is. Bethesda needs to take a page from all the major MMO’s and learn from their mistakes. 
---
Cant we have hardcore survival where you drop everything you are carrying? Maybe change the carry weight as well so you cant take 500 items into battle.
---
Sure there should be a normal mode like described, but i think a realistic hardcore survival mode would be a very nice addtion.  It would really make you think about battles and missions and make you fear death.
---
Kinda bugs me that the barrel changes the damage output instead of having a "hardened" receiver like everything else does. I prefer the look of the standard barrel over the heavy barrel but I'm not about to sacrifice damage.
---
Hmm, since it was my first nuke, I selected fissure prime assuming people would just gather, but ya, I think you could be right, I will keep this in mind thanks
---
Not from my experience. the ammo is pretty heavy and pretty low damage and rate of fire. More of a fun novelty for low level game play/events. 
---
Nope. But apparently a lot of people are having a bad week because they can’t have something that isn’t real in a video game and have to complain on and on about how unfair it is and make up all kinds of dumb ideas about why they are being denied these objects and how they are being lied too. 
---
Someone literally just dropped a nuke on us just as the bots started marching. What a dick move :( wasted all our time...
---
Big open world, nobodys icons on map (unless they have been given a bounty) and the ability to add stealth boy modification to power armor. (Among other things).  This is not deathmatch or battle Royale.  It will not play out the way you're thinking.  It will be fine.
---
Glad to hear I aint the only one, but ya, it just felt so anticlimactic since it was my first nuke
---
Also play instruments when you see them for the "well tuned" bonus
---
Got it. Thanks! (But it does sound pretty cool I think)
---
He scares me.
---
3* super OP guns have all been duped to death already, for months. I guarantee if you have a rare mask right now, you can trade it for any weapon you want. With weapons, we're at the point of getting picky with our third slot rolls. 
---
LOVE this idea. I’ve dreamed of such a game from Bethesda for years. I think it would greatly benefit from having NPCs too tho. You send out a group of your faction’s soldiers to help defend/attack location, etc. 
---
I think maybe you're reading the sub too much, I haven't made an excuses here. Just a terrible week to end up getting disconnected from the internet when I've been hype for the last month for this event.
---
Oh not, not a melee fighter coming to raid my camp. [Whatever will I do?](https://i.imgur.com/pyAXbnZ.png)
---
I always pick up the "Happy Faschnaut!" note on the bar inside that yellow building the radtoads spawn from.  Then I leave it in a brown bag by itself at the end of the parade.  Maybe I should save it and sell it for caps in a few months.
---
Pipe and laser guns can be either pistols or rifles depending on which grips you use. The rest of the mods are shared. 
---
noticed this today as well
---
Keep server hoping then. Sometimes it takes 6 hops for me.
---
&gt;I'd rather have that option to start on an equal playing field once than never have it
---
\^ That's how. You don't care about new players. You care about yourself right now. That's the entire problem with starting characters over. In a week, you'll be that "bully" you love to blame. 
---
Agreed.  Have a few of them. 
---
Hypothetical, but Good luck finding me.  First person you kill will probably put a bounty on you and you'll be the only person showing on the map for the whole server.  I'll stealth boy somewhere and pop some shots off when your not standing still or sprinting just to make sure Sential or cavalier isn't active.  All I'm getting stuff here, is it won't be a "field day".   It's survival, not PvP deathmatch battle Royale league of legends.  Big map, quests to do, things to explore and bonus exp to be had (20% is a lot).  
---
You don’t see the long term problems with your idea of the game mode. I can’t make you understand when all you do is believe your right and refuse to understand the drawbacks.  Yo I argue that it will fix the problems by not having op duped weapons. Also by saying the builds are not the problem. However the builds are the problems. And duping while it won’t be present at the very start will arise again very rapidly as the market for op guns skyrockets. This will put evey one who doesn’t start a new character the same day the new server goes live at such a massive disadvantage they won’t be able to play the game with out major problems. And the idea of if you can’t make it or of flatwoods that’s your problem is the reason why I can’t convince you you have some crazy idea that new players will be perfectly okay if they come in. Days weeks later when they won’t be. Think of the game mode two moths after the release. It will be exactly the same as adventure. However now you have no option to level the playing field by playing in adventure to gear up and make a viable build and get a camp around. Without a camp you can only respawn at the vault where a slew of high level raiders will be waiting. 
---
I think maybe people read other people’s post and decide they need to make their own so they can be on the same bandwagon for attention.
---
Cause now your trying to come off all indifferent. 
---
After all is there wasn’t any real reason to post the things you did if as you claim, you’re just having a bad week.
---
Plus, the new characters would only matter in the first two weeks. It will make the mode even worse because now you have level 300 running around while new players have to start from lv1 right out of the vault only. With beth's way, at least new people can prep before going in. 
---
Way smaller magazine though so I’m not sure it can compete in sustained dps but it’s not like I’ve run the math. 
---
Especially if it’s repeatable! 
---
I know it’s a game but I honestly hope people would help others out. 
---
I remember starting out and a random player gave me a 1* armor leather chest and a fully upgraded shotgun at level 10! Since then I’ve paid it forward and still do! 
---
I've randomly gotten 1* armour after this event too (aside from the Sloth's loot)
---
I think I have like 10 or more of each common mask, I've been farming like hell. Not a single rare one... not even the most hardcore players can get all of them, or even a single one maybe.
---
It's a good but cumbersome weapon. Ammo is super heavy and it has insane recoil. But with the automatic receiver it becomes a powerhouse. Assuming you can control the recoil.
---
Agreed a full reset only fixes he problem in the very short term and makes its ten times worse a few weeks after. 
---
That fucking sucks my guy
---
Ive got a question for you what did you think when Rumors where going round that Bethesda was making fallout 76 free to play
---
I never thought about this..... when i saw that perk, I only thought of useless steel and woods. Oh well.. TIL
---
These drop chances on the rare masks is just absurd with this event time-limit. What the actual f.
---
&gt; I see griefers bullying low-level players all the damn time in this game
---
No you don't lol. If you're telling me you barely play, let me assure you then that I have many many times the hours put into it as you do. In my **hundreds** of hours I've only even seen griefing a couple times, but even considering that, almost everyone are nice to lowbies, even griefers. 
---
That being said I'm sure that won't be the case in a pvp only mode, but still. You don't need to grind a new character for hours a day, you can do it exactly like lots of other people who can't play all the time. A little bit at a time.
---
&gt;  I'm high enough level to not have to worry about people harassing me
---
No, you're not. There's no such thing and I know plenty of people who don't mess with low players but won't back down to anyone above 50.
---
&gt; Like others in this thread have mentioned, it'll only be a "fresh start" for two weeks - After that it'll be the same as it is now. All the people with tons of time on their hands to grind will have been able to obtain all the two-shot explosives and other fun goodies that they want, the only major difference is that players like me will be shit out of luck because we won't have the time to catch up.
---
It's not about being a fresh start, it's about getting the massive amount of dupes out of the system. Again, I've got hundreds of hours played and I've never once had a TSE drop, or a bloodied explosive for that matter. It takes a **lot** to farm those kinds of god roll weapons for your average player (someone did the math in a reddit thread once, a perfect god roll drop takes about 700 hours of farming on average based on current drop chances). Sure there will be a lucky person here or there who has some fairly quickly on the server, but after the first two weeks most people aren't even going to be max level let alone having high end gear.
---
There is no such thing as not having the time to start again, it's having the drive to go through starting again that you lack. If you played for 40 minutes every other day, you'd still be able to get back to where you are right now in a month or two. That's not even that big of a deal.
---
It’s pronounced BOAR-zoy. It’s a breed of dog. I used to show them when I was younger. 
---
Guys, it's not deathmatch.  Stop lol.   You know, if I see you, I might just ignore you and sneak 20 minutes in the other direction to kill ghouls for 20% exp.  It's just fallout 76, with more pvp feature enable.  You can't see me on the map and with a 1* legendary chameleon leather leg armor you can hide damn near indefinitely.  If you die you don't even lose your gear or weapons.  It's not so bad.  Relaxxxxxx :P
---
I just go to vault 76 and stand outside afk with no loot
---
Glad you're doing your part. Whenever I see low levels on the server I'm on, I always craft and mod a hunting rifle and armor for them + some stims and radaway.
---
Lvl 255, 1050 hours + 2 reroll lvl 88 and 66... For people saying that we have to make new reroll for Survival, can you just... I don't know... Shut up? Please, that would be so kind.
---
Reddit is not the majority of the gamers and explosive weapons are not a problem when well stuffed/builded, SA don't make you invincible too.
---
Let us go play like we want in PVP, and if you don't like it why not staying in Poneyland to farm and come in Survival when well stuffed/builded?
---
40's on xbox. I can't change my GT due to other games that I play, but I'll keep my eyes out for you.                  GT Deviant Monster
---
The other side is that if you have to make a fresh character, you could be a noob getting matched with lvl 100+ meta builds. 
---
The ideal solution is making survival only PLUS grouping servers by level range.
---
Only if, as one faction appears to gain dominance, Scorched descend and kill everyone.
---
Time zone?
---
Because I want to see what the game would've been like if it launched like this. Everyone level 1. No stupid legendaries.  
---
So I've done it like 20 times, and no server drops. The sloth glitched a few times, but otherwise it felt very stable. 
---
Looks great. More of a compound. I like the lack of doors. In my opinion it prevents people destroying it.
---
Yeah, I am definitely not referring to the Sloth's loot. 
---
Yeah that and keeping up with .308 crafting makes it a tough sell as a primary weapon. But burst DPS, I’d call it a strong contender for winner. Sustained is a different story. 
---
Honestly maybe what we need is not a new player for survival which I won't argue isn't a bad idea I would like that but I dont think it would be a bad idea to start with the same character and a fresh inventory or the same character with a perk respec option because some players do need that or maybe just both. Idk. Just throwing it out there
---
True, wow had factions. Factions would be great here.
---
It looks really good, I've just recently finished remodeling my C.A.M.P.
---
It seems like you just want a built in inequality because it suits you and not because it’s a better mechanic. Grind in adventure until your good enough for survival just gatekeeps survival for new players.

MrsP123 because I was super creative at the time. I love hearing vaulters greet me with "hey Mrs P!" Like I'm Mrs Garrett from Facts Of Life. BTW when will PS4 finally let us change or username?
---
Did he fight the megasloth?
---
I’ll be damned! My daily’s have been all messed up and not popping up right. I’m going to keep my eyes peeled at vendors tho 
---
TES were also one shotting end game mob content. 
---
So because I have a personal opinion, share it, along with other reasons why I have that opinion and why it doesn't hurt anyone to have, I only care about myself and don't care about new players? 
---
I don't know which bully you're referring to. 
---
That's actually not a half bad solution, this is supposed to be a beta of the survival after all. 
---
Once survival drops those who have been playing have to start anew but can still move back and forth.
---
Though that wouldn't address people from using its to move up guns and armor to their survival toon.

Bethesda should be fixing the dupe bugs as they come up. Minimizing the duping is a huge point of the games success in general. Why go work on farming new items when I can just hit up a duper for everything in the game? Builds are definitely an issue because you really can spec yourself out to be godlike but that is something that would be a much more impressive accomplishment to achieve imo if it is done in survival and ONLY survival. What do you think of my bracket idea to keep everyone in the same-ish leveled servers? Just at the start to allow for fair progression and to negate level 200s farming level 5 players. The mode 2 months after release will be a lot better if the bracket/section idea I keep bringing up were implemented. Everyone would atleast start the game fair and whatever happens as the game progresses is an issue after future experience.
---
That seems to miss the point of what he said.  There will always be people ahead.  XD
---
Also please take a look at the actual mechanics here.  No one visible on map.  Players that are killed can put bounty on their killer to show them on the map.  20% exp boost for minding your own business and killing shit in a cave in a corner of the map.  1* legendary effect chameleon that let's you go predator invisible.   Stealth boys mods on bulknng power armor too.   This is not some deathmatch game that we are going to be spawn camped and blown up 20 times back to back.  In the rare chance you encounter another player and do die, you keep your armor and weapons.   (And most everything else too probably besides some caps)
---
Which is very likely. 
---
I disagree, only because I know that griefers will try to make it a highschool kinda game.
---
It makes the train sound every time you reload it. I have fun with mine. With little work to it I can one shot Super Mutants with it. 
---
Check the waters of cranberry bog. Not the deep water.
---
&gt; By obtaining them the same way as all of us did
---
Except the majority of god roll (mostly TSE) weapons are from exploits. More than once I've been on a server at white springs and someone was handing out TSE's to people before the exploits were finally removed. They were there for months. For **MONTHS** people were duping items and selling/distributing them to players.
---
&gt; Another problem with the reset is that it's a band-aid approach at best. If people want to "reset" for Survival just because other players have stuff they want, should we "reset" every two weeks or so just to make sure that everything is "fair" for newer players?
---
This is naive *at best*. It's not about being fair, it's about being balanced. Who cares if someone destroys you over and over? If that guy put in the time and effort it takes to reign supreme, then he should. That's the very nature of a pvp survival environment. If you don't like it, don't play it.
---
I feel like you should still need at least 3 Intelligence to equip all 3 hacking cards (someone with 1 Intelligence hacking into the most protected systems just makes no sense), but definitely make it so they don't cost any points.
---
Did it drop anything good?
---
Do you have any other plans from this event?
---
For general loot tables that don't have special variables (as is the case with the masks), Bethesda puts multiple copies of items that they want to be more common into the table. This can be verified by going through the loot tables and comparing this to in-game experience. So yes, you can be sure if you study the game data. Just trying to provide information in case it helps, there's no need to get upset.
---
Unfortunately, no. He arrived just in time to fight the Radtoads though.
---
Same lol
---
Right outside Watoga in the river there are a bunch if you follow it up and down,  there are also some behind the agricultural center near Flatwoods. 
---
I wasn't really happy too be quite honest as I spent the full $60 on the game and those rumors were literally going around a month after release. But the model the game uses with there being 18$+ microtransactions in the store would better fit a free to play game. If this were to happen I would hope they would atleast compensate everyone who bought full price with a load of ATOMS as a thank you for buying and believing in the game at full price.
---
Ok. I might try to find one cheap just to try a few times, it might be fun. Thanks!
---
I think so. Connection is quick, but then everything is really laggy for the first minute.

The Big Snit: it's a 90s Canadian Short Film. It's like 10 mins long. I suggest you watch it on YouTube. It might leave you a little fuzzy inside. 
---
Ew, it’s diseased. I mean how? A robot?
---
Sorry for the late reply but no I usually just drop them and get rid of them, but I could easily get some more while I keep farming the event.
---
I ended up getting the bonfire which I heard is rare but I used it
---
Mine is pretty simple. There was/is a period before the exe. But ya know name conventions. Although I’m changing it soon. 
---
I only ever got 1 at a time from him... and I’ve been running it on 4 alts, probably 16 times total so far
---
I usually get rid of any duplicates I get, but I’ll keep farming the event for other masks and I’m sure I’ll get more plans.
---
I don't believe this was intended behavior. As every day since launch I've only gotten one a day from him; either or.
---
The day the event launched however I did manage to get both quests; which I assumed was a glitch/fluke. 
---
I assumed it was one per day-either or to slow down player progression. I could be wrong though.
---
The blurb when you are on the main screen "Play/Social/Atomic shop" etc... where it says the current event could be changed to "Visit our webpage &lt;link&gt; to vote on the upcoming feature!" (possibly with a hyperlink if possible?)
---
That way all players will see the message but they can simply code it in HTML or use a polling service etc, with very minimal work on their end.
---

They have recently upped the scrap u get. I was getting 11 steel per assault rifle, and now I get 18 per. As an example
---
Level 1 one star Troubleshooter's Leather Right Arm. The other one dropped a level 1 one star Furious Pipe Wrench. 
---
On Xbox my only problem so far is not being able to join the event right away when I fast travel, I have to wait a few minutes for all the event related stuff including the master of ceremonies to spawn in.
---
Duping won’t be fixed because the problem is with the game engine and server refresh speeds they fixed the last show by making so you can’t have over a certain amount of items to crash the server. So every one just went to the trade menu dupe and that can’t be fixed as easy as that deals with sever refresh and to fix that you would have to make the server rollback time very very short and that’s not feasible as of now it’s 3min it would need to be more like 3 seconds or less as that’s the time it takes to make a trade then instantly buy it back before the server notices you bought it back it is then up for sale again. Even though you already bought it. As to a bracket system. It sounds good on paper but levels don’t mean anything in the game other than weapon armor level requirements. But you can have god armor that is level 5 or level 50 it’s all random so it won’t really stop just make the market more demand heavy. There will be charters only level 10 that will not level and go around just killing players as they exit the vault especially if you have a large bracket gap.  My whole issue with the new Characters isn’t the builds the guns or anything other than the ability for new players to join the game 2 months down the road. I think the survival mode should only slow level 50 players or higher in as that is triplet the only fair way to do it every one has equal opportunity to make a viable build and farm weapons or buy them. Jus because you choose not to buy the duped op weapons doesn’t mean others won’t and you have to account for it. 
---
I'd think at least 3. That gives you room for one Combat build, one Crafting build and one more utility slot for, say, a farming build with Green Thumb/Butcher's Bounty/Scrounger/etc, or an alternate combat setup, or whatever.
---
They could make a stat minimum needed to use equip the cards but make them zero cost, though generally you’ll have that much special if you get the perk anyways unless you’re getting them from packs
---
Mutants isn’t really a build, almost everyone is mutated and there isn’t much more too it. I know a few people have run Berzerker builds for the challenge, but it’s less powerful than a Bloodied build (far fewer synergies) so its not popular. 
---
Junkies is literally only the weapon, and I haven’t heard exactly how the damage formula works on that, so IDK. Plus the maintenance costs from staying hopped up on enough chems to get a good boost (or SPECIAL debuffs if you aren’t keeping up on chems) are a pretty big negative.
---
I payed 150$ for the game and when i heard that i just wanted a refund my 150$ or 150$ worth of aroms
---
After the first day I had all the plans/recipes and 7 million of the normal masks and one beret, with the low or no existent drops of rare masks I quit doing it totally 
---
I just finished the parade with another guy only pretty intense at the end toothy man lol 
---
A computer virus, duh

---
Psst your download speed to a speed test server has very little to do with the quality of your connection to the game servers, just for future reference.
---
I'm on pc and I've been fine, pretty laggy though.
---
There's a megasloth at the parade? I've yet to encounter one and didn't notice one in the fighting. Of course, I didn't notice many enemies, since everyone else was gunning them down at a distance and I was standing next to the robots with my power fist waiting for the toad or two that broke through the lines.
---
I’m in my 40’s &amp; love using the railway rifle as a thrifty travel plinker to clear road ghouls
---
while I’m endlessly hoofing it (perma-over-encumbered)because while the ammo is heavy, 
---
it’s often recoverable from corpses and crafts w only steel, no gunpowder &amp; works 
---
well w rifle perks. Gun Runner perk (Agility) nice for boosting run speed if you’re a hiker.
---
I got that. It’s nice asf got it on my 3rd try 
---
You’re welcome. It used to be that anyone and everyone would show up but power armor is becoming less and less used.
---
Heres the thing though Why would I KoS you if I need your help taking down a queen or whatever. they need to fix the nukes, add more bosses requiring teamwork instead of using the nukes to farm ghouls.
---
That’s the server registering all you stuff and inventory so if you get a crash or disconnect it knows what gear you had. It does this automatically in the background every few minutes. To ensure you don’t loose anything if you crash. 
---
Cool thanks man
---
Did you noticed they added a new type of crafting station to make booze?
---
At the very end 
---
Banned player here, never duped have proof on my yt channel and xbox dvr, never had stacks of anything in my inventory just my weapon collection (I collect tse and bloodied swing speeds) when I was unbanned nothing was removed same for the real duper’s, I saw screenshots of one dude with millions of pounds in his inventory! I strongly suggest Bethesda reintroduce all of us and remove the duper’s crap!! Seriously take there stuff away and let us actual accidentally banned players play again. I love this game and miss playing with my friends 
---
Downvotes incoming as usual for claiming innocence, don’t care it’s the truth, peace and love.
---
I saw some stingwings and dogs then, but that's it. Next time I run the event I'll have to pay more attention. And probably bring a different weapon along.
---
Man, that's some bs :)
---
Now people are one shotting 3* legendary end quest bosses. What's the difference? 
---
Nice. Something for everyone 
---
If you think sentinel assasin is invincible, you don't know a damn thing about PvP. Good day sir.
---
No logic there. im have the right to complain, just like you can complain about me complaining. 
---
Just put on a slave caller and some kinky leather 
---
Well i was mostly joking about the taking reddit as word of god (though you are right there are very few signs of them taking player feedback and actually doing something with it.)
---
But the in-game polling is a very good idea in all honesty with how obsessed the industry is with metrics and tracking user behaviour its kinda weird that they almost never ask you directly what you think about X, Y or Z 
---
Oh... that. Haven't gotten around to the brewing event yet.
---
That might work for pc players, but not necessarily for console gamers. I would rather not have to go and type a url into my pc or phone to vote. I think it should be in the game client itself. 
---
Heavy guns are great for this, but Stabilized is pretty important which means hot-swapping from melee to heavy is... not fast, as you’d have to drop PA and load in to it. You can get away without Stabilized, it’s just a noticeable accuracy and damage loss.
---
Gatling gun would be my recommendation for a Heavy Gun vs aerial targets. It has good accuracy and won’t waste a ton of ammo spraying the sky
---
I want a devil costume to go with my flaming pitchfork. 
---
Not really true. The server is limited to 25 people. They can't be everywhere.
---
Behind the vault-tec ag center near Flatwoods 
---
This question is asked literally every day.  Are you going to let other people tell you what to do or are you going to go conquer the wasteland like the bad ass mofo I’m sure you are?  Jesus. If you’re on the forum, then you have interest. So play. Or don’t. More room for me. 
---
Consider yourself lucky that the idiot who still uses Targeting HUD (or Berry Mentats) didn't crash clients and the event for everyone. :-/
---
I often see on reddit people saying they have no turrets. The other day on the road from the Overseer camp to Flatwoods, there was a guy with a camp and he had built 30 turrets. 
---
There's no evidence on twitter, facebook, xbox/ps4 shares, *fucking anywhere*.
---
If they're dropping, where are the new screenshots with them?
---
I’m sure it’s devs who got those masks spawned. I doubt those are regular players.
---
Yes; all of this. I too am pissed, as I am in a similar boat. 
---
Preordered, for the B.E.T.A., as I was always a straight hoard in my Fallout, I didn’t even start missions till I had already maxed out two mules (and their stashes) before I ran into new friend on week 3 after launch. It just ramped up from there. 
---
While I cannot be certain of the providence of gifts/loans/donations/buys, I proceeded to collect everything not nailed down. That is my Fallout jam. Scrap it all down, built out my C.A.M.P., milled assloads of ammo, gather/traded/bought as much stable flux as was available. Did the main grind for plans, as well as paid for them. I worked/traded my ass off. 
---
Around the time the implemented the max weight limit, I had consolidated everything to one mule; the rest were maxed-ish, except my main. When your numbers came out, right after I was banned, I knew I had as many; if not more; items pass through my hands in just about the same amount of time. 
---
Which is when I started defending you (and others, but I jumped in where I could in your defense). I went into this game with the lofty idea of doing what I love about Fallout; have been trained to do, by previous games; and was punished for it, the same as you. 
---
Do I think Bethesda f-ed up? Yes. Did I enjoy getting my character back? Yes. Did that make this hurt more; even when I literally spend what little time I got to try and make my characters conform to the new standard? Oh fuck yes. 
---
But I *really* love Fallout, and I hope I get a chance to enjoy, again, this particular version I have come to love as well. I shall all of your anger, but I still hold hope for what *could* be a great game. 
---
Yeah it is odd. They could probably make more money if they tailored it more to what the general player wants. Even if it isolates the the hardcore players a little. 
---
They have taken a few suggestions from here and I think most of them were good ones. 
---
I get 550. Not sure what you mean by without Chems. Deep pocketed armour will give you about 10 per piece.
---
I mean.
---
It's literally a joke.
---
It's an april fool's article by a company that has run them in their magazine for over a decade.
---
Then it is on Bethesda. Find a way to fix duping. I'm sure someone is smart enough to create a system for deleting duped items. It shouldn't be too difficult to create a fix for the same item existing multiple times. It is just laziness on their part for not having a legitimate fix. Levels more or less just mean time played. With the increase in XP in Survival I feel my bracket system would only affect a player for a short time period. Any "god tier" armor or weapon obtained at level 5-20 is not going to be as useful later on in the game. PVP just about everything is going to be pretty strong after builds are fully recognized in Survival. The brackets would just protect the very beginning starter characters that haven't done much in the game yet. And to your earlier point of duped weapons still being rampant throughout the game and that they will one way or another make their way into Survival: Why should I be punished for playing the game as intended and not duplicating weapons and paying real life money as some did for ridiculous items exploiters created such an issue on.
---
Trade for what with what? I doubt people will part with the Uber rare stuff for caps they don’t need.
---
I'll fart in my hand and quickly lift it up and release it under your nose....thats what they are worth to me.
---
Sorry, I dont understand the mentality of wasting hours upon hours collecting rare digital items that will mean nothing in 12 months. Granted you can sell them for real cash, which is even sadder thinking someone out there would actually pay real money for these items.
---
Not having a go at peoples choices, do whatever makes you happy thats the whole point to life. Its just life is really short &amp; I dont want to waste it doing this.
---
Finally someone that gets it
---
Anyone who payed for the game 100% deserves compensation if the game ever goes free to play

By bethesda
---
Would I be able to join and work my way up to a paladin? Then organize an uprising overthrowing the elder ultimately causing a split in the fraction.   Where then the two opposing brotherhoods fight for control of the nukes to wipe out the remaining opposing side. That sounds fun but I totally wouldn’t start an uprising or anything like that. Promise. 
---
This is very hard to believe
---
What you have to do is craft item in chemistry station, always works for me.
---
can't use dp with power armor. What are the stats on the armor you're using?
---
People think they did it as a ploy to teat their duping patch. See what people who were banned will do in the new update so they can patch that too. Not sure if true. 
---
Since survival had us dropping Aid as well as junk now, I'm starting to think my similar habit may be toxic for the future game mode. Tried to cut down today by removing the perk. It hurts baaaad but I'm managing.
---
And still, plenty of people play the game that don't bother with that shit so the lack of it isn't conclusive evidence 
---
Try it out and see for yourself. This was my staple contribution to the fight until quite recently.
---
You can of course join, as long as you stay respectful. And there’s no elder in our faction since based on the time line the only elder is the council and high elder maxson 💪 I’ll DM you the link rn. 
---
let's live together 25 years in a vault and fking kill each for survive the day after we get out LMAOOOOOOOOOO
---
I attempted it solo with my gunslinger and only one bot survived. Still got same rewards (dupes) as if all survived. 
---
I had that happen to me to I think it has something to do with either clicking on him a lot right when he finishes his dialog and you just happen to get the names quest and random drink quest at the same time because I have yet to see two of the same type of quest or something to do with loading in and getting the random quest pop up on your screen even tho you don’t have one yet.
---
You shouldn’t be punished for not using duped items my only point is that a new character won’t fix the problem and make it hard for new players to play the game mode later on down the road. 
---
Lol this game is still live?
---
With only 15% health there is a legitimate risk of death. Before there was no risk and you could do it at render distance.  Which allowed a single player to stand still and kill all the mobs in an area preventing others from tagging them.
---
Using only melee their is a chance to tag as many mobs as I can before they can move into kill range.
---
my ping from south america is shit for pvp, so even if i'm a godly sentinel i usually hit the air with my weapons, i never touch the other guy not even in vats
---
I don't think a lot of players appreciate the entertainment value in starting from scratch. Especially in an all-new, more hostile environment.
---
There is two pools with the berries in them by greenhouses behind the main building.
---
No elder to overthrow? DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! I mean oh that’s fine. Sounds like fun haha. 
---
Epic steel drop incoming!!!
---
The problem i didn't explain is as follows
---
The Scorched Earth Event starts when prime is nuked i believe and it starts counting from there. It takes me.... 10 minutes lets say to return to camp in a rush, reload my queen weapons and maybe make ammo (ultracite plasma cores and ultracite 5.56), that step may requires ANOTHER perk change to ammosmith and super duper. Then its another respec to heavy guns and whatnot, hopefully no other running like grabbing water and chems. Then i still have to fast travel.  When i do get there, we're say 22 minutes remaining, but i can fight.  15 show up, 7 went immediately and aren't prepared or under equipped, just boosting her. The other 8 more or less did what i did taking maybe 5-10. Now its a hard fight. And thats only if the server has enough willing or able now.
---
In a proper group, everyone does that while the silo is being run and the whole fight group is hanging out at Watoga Station waiting for the the field goal. The second it ignites you have 15+ decked out soldiers crossing that field and cutting everything down. 
---
I'm not slighting anyone who random launches down there to try their 1st or 3rd queen fight, thats just why it fails half the time. Its stupidly easy for a proper group and a waste of 25k ammo for an unprepared group of randoms. Though, sometimes they get lucky, I've been in said groups and failed a dozen times over with nothing to show but broken guns and a drastically lower ammo supply.
---
Hmm what's your psn
---
Mind if i add you too? 
---
And will i be looking for the same name?
---
Did he help kill stuff?
---
As a low level player I support this. Like, I still have plenty of content to have fun with. All y'all endgame players need fun too. 
---
Just the Radtoads.
---
Many people exploited bugs in the system, and mechanics now disallowed (e.g., Whitespring gunracks), to give themselves an unfair advantage in the early days of a game; they can't seriously be considering a character transfer. PvE and PvP chars should be kept separate from each other... -_-
---
People grief for any and all reasons in online worlds. You really think even half of the players would bother being honest or even voting? 
---
cool post manchild
---
Link sent to your DM, can’t wait to see your participation 🤝
---
Thanks for trying!
---
It’s the same psn
---
What if I'm significantly higher level than my friend?
---
Like unban everyone, see what happens, reban everyone if someone in the community does something they don't like? 
---
Good suggestion.  Most of you are cancer.  
---
Yet, you wasted precious life moments writing this salty ass comment...  
---
I suffer from insomnia, so in my time in the late nights where there's absolutely nothing better to do than game, I game. This event only lasts a week, so I'm not exactly spending my entire life playing it. 
---
I'm doing what I enjoy with the time that I have. 
---
Yeah that’s okay. Same psn as my name on here 
---
Very true! Not to mention even if you’re a lower level if you team up I’m sure you could defeat it if it’s a little more challenging, which just reinforces the multiplayer/PVE aspect of the game that I love 
---
My reply was meant to go here, sorry new to reddit. Still figuring it out. 
---
Pretty sure that's not how it is supposed to work but does, I am definitely getting 550 carry weight with the Escalator PA. I only use Escalator .. I will check later to try see what gives me 550.
---
oh i thought you were talking abouy the death skull mask which apparently no one has managed to get yet
---
Fall damage is different. Those two are additive. And there’s other perks that can also add in. Serendipity, dodgy, blocker if you’re melee. 
---
In my experience deep pocket always beats power armor. In FO4, I'd dread using PO because it would lower my carry weight. 
---
Also, there are probably legendary items that would work. Ik black diamond gives +1 strength
---
&gt; I play in spanish,
---
wait i'm not alone? uno de nosotros? 
---
cry
---
Probably missed it, but has the legendary vendor and player vending been pushed? I remember seeing something about that being released with WA, but havent seen either AFAIK
---
My main point through all of this is : I want something that actually makes the game feel like they added something new. The only thing survival in the form they plan to release adds to the game imo is the ability to just be one shot from behind without any chance by some nerd with all the OP gear not even grinded for but just duped and given to him. Even if they separate the servers or even just made it an option via a filter would be a huge improvement and would allow everyone to be happy.
---
Maybe not everyone but there have been quite a few posts of people saying they were unbanned for a week then rebanned recently. So its either the above or just a glitch. Tbh bethesda fuck up is likely but who knows
---
I hope it's a challenge! Not SBQ challenging but at least 3 star lvl 95 deathclaw/mirelurk queen etc. I'm a lvl 148 heavy gunner/rifle/explosive build I live to fuck some shit up! Lol
---
My servers are full of people, no-one is doing the event anymore. Me and two others going to try it this time.  lean on participants all of a sudden.
---
If in any game ever there's a pve mode and a pvp mode, the pvp mode will be a pvp deathmatch battle royale kos gankfest 3000 no matter what it's called. (Unless it's an rp server where kos is forbidden)
---
I think if it was presented in a non intrusive way that was easily executed and noticeable, yes they would. I do not believe that there are enough people that would vote for something just to be a duck would make a difference among the results. Plus it would be the ultimate show of them actually caring about our feedback. It would be a win all around for Bethesda is implemented in the proper way. 
---
Well I mean while still grinding some, not just handed to them.
---
Doing my own testing just now deep pocketed doesn't affect my carry weight when I'm in power armor. 
---
I wanna be scared during the vent like in the trailer I wanna be walking threw the woods and hear that alien snarl and say oh shit. 
---
Did you miss the PvP damage rework in the patch notes they already taken this into account.  They are designing this to be a late game game mode for high level players wanting more of a challenge. That’s what the player base wants and needs at this point a character reset is the opposite of the goal in mind and have negative affects months down the road. 
---
  What I meant is I'm not on lagging in FO76 because I have a crap internet connection. Everything internet is fast except for FO76.  BUT... If you can tell me how to increase the quality of my connection to Fo76 game servers I'm all ears!
---
Just came back from a business trip so I missed all the new at launch, but what I did notice is the really bad connection to the game servers.  Had to quit last night is was so bad.  Thought it was my ISP or something.  Spring break is going on so all the kids will be Netflixing and Fortnighting all night long in my neighborhood.   That's why I checked to make sure I wasn't being bottle necked by my ISP connection. 
---
As I said not having a go at peoples choices but since your such a sensitive petal go read a farken book.
---
It has been trying not to jump in when I see *“waiting to see the 900 hours guy”* on these posts, but I don’t want to feed these trolls; I’ll save my ammo. Any defense, no matter how justified, explained &amp; corroborated it is, falls on deaf ears in this particular community. If only I had been less worried about compliance &amp; more about evidence I would have more proof. But I have some. 
---
It saddens me because I am in another country and for a week I was able to play with my wife again and then nothing.
---
Screws and springs, server hop and run Sugar Grove. Tons of fans and clipboards, good plastic too. Hot plates too for screws. Shoot north of there to Ellas Bunker for 7ish microscopes that have fiber optics and gears too, decent quick stop. Not much more than some rad roaches.

Lead. You can get a ton of it, but youll need acid. Go to Lucky Mine i think down in cranberry bog. West of watoga. Its a LEAD MINE. Molemen inhabit it, scorched too. Theres multiple workbenches to take power armor and scrapper  you will come out loaded. I think i picked up a couple hundred lead ore in there which balloons when you refine it. Make sure to use SUPER DUPER 3 AND CHEMIST ON THE CHEM BENCH. CHEMIST DOUBLES CHEM OUTPUT AND REFINING IS CHEMS. Add super duper and you start really adding up. Gunpowder from cloth and acid.
---
Is the whole must be below half your level thing true?
---
Why not keep the level but ditch the inventory? You bring over your perks and knowledge (making getting starting gear not too hard) and dont have to worry about duped legendaries. From all the opinions on this, it seems like it strikes a nice balance, and allows a way to negate the item duping from earlier. 
---
Does you 495 include the extra 100 from Excavator ?
---
This happened to me also. The icon for the stored building has a lock icon. Wont let me place it and doesn't give me an error or reason why. I just built this place before the update too. Shouldn't have torn down my old camp I guess. 
---
"Who knows" is right because they won't respond to anything.

Gamma gun is way faster (125 rads a shot vs 15 from a radium rifle) but the projectiles are actual projectiles and not hitscan, so you gotta be close to guarantee hits.
---
Automatic receiver has an insane RoF though. You get up close and you can fill them with rads in seconds.
---
I thought about that but once you switch weapons you lose it. Can you get +200 with deep pocketed?
---
I was here for the beta, it was a glorious 2 weeks. Newbies had no problem getting to white spring, mob fights lasted at least 15 seconds, seing an explosive gun was awesome. Add just about every one as a friend. But yea it did not last long. It was a different game. Being pvp based kinda wipes a lot of that out, so less important I think. Min max players will negate any reset quickly and makes it harder for normal players to catch up.
---
Having same problem on Xbox since the beta it's weird
---
Nerf the nerfing.....
---
Don’t worry my odds are they will be in the atom shop shortly. 😂😂
---
Im legit doing it completely alone right now.
---
k thanks
---
The last update seemed to make the gunshots lifelike. Deafening.
---
Because that defeats the purpose.  Of a survival mode.
---
And I'm sure just like with everything else Bethesda has done with this game.. they will still screw the damage rework up. There are literally builds combined with certain weapons that will one shot just about anything and anyone. I see many of your points and am absolutely seeing the flaws in my original proposal for the idea of this mode. But I think having a filter that allows the choice of only matching with other ONLY survival players.. or choosing to play survival with adventure mode characters, would be the correct way to go. Give the players what they want and not just what they feel is the way they should go. Because I'm sure we can both agree that Bethesda is like 2 for 90 at this point on making decent choices with this game. And I would like to see that number balance out more.
---
If they ever make polls in-game it should be accessible from the main menu, not inside the gameplay. 
---
I'm on the opposite spectrum on that question, I would prefer a harsher limitation on perk swap. It's an RPG, you should think about your build.
---
I would like a 30 mins locked perk loadout afyer swapping cards. Maybe just in Survival to make it more hardcore.
---
Okay, saved three robots (wolves at the end, damn them) and all I got was a Garland plan :(
---
It would solve the imbalance between standard and survival.  Pvp is either integrated into the game or completely separated. 
---
In Ark understand this and they have pvp and pve servers separated. Even private servers isolate pve worlds and pvp.
---
OdysseusJones. Made up that handle around 2010, I guess it's a mashed-up bastardization of the Greek figure Odysseus, Osmosis 
---
Jones, and Indiana Jones. Usually hear people say "Odyssey Jones," which is totally understandable.
---
I'm gonna keep 2 of each.  They sell for 2 caps at a vendor.  Drop your extras to let everyone get a set. I need a giant.  It's a silly costume, only worth anything for the novelty.  The camp plans on the other hand might be worth holding onto as I've gotten a bunch of duplicates and there are quite a few of them.  Some might be considered rare and worth keeping.
---
It seems so. OP said players are not on map unless they're wanted.
---
yes, as well as calibrated shocks
---
I do have a comment to make on this PVP by definition isn’t fair.. there’s always a winner and there’s always a loser. Not matter what happens the chance of a complaint will increase exponentially. 
---
If I may suggest that  to reduce this bethesda goes the way of other games and lvl cap the pvp so that Lowndes can’t just be one tapped by the god lvls. Anything under 50 is in a league of its own anything above another league. Could even make that certain lvls only spawn on maps with this lvl cap in mind.
---
camp building is so slow. lag. but only lag in build mode when i place stuff. there is no lag when killing enemies during or before.
---
I was wondering if we are doing it wrong. Like it resets our RNG progress if we server jump. The new survival mode had me thinking like this as the leaderboard is tied to the server ( how long you are alive in the server the higher on the board you are). Or maybe the report we get in our notes are tied to it. Not sure but it had me  thinking about it.
---
&gt;it would be a near waste of time for these higher level players to pick on lower level players
---
Have.. have you met many assholes in your life? No reason just curious..
---
Ha! Good luck! 
---
Ouch...
---
A lot of the perks i swap at least are... inconsequential to you. Hacker 1-3, Lockpick 1-3, Chemist, Super Duper, Ammosmith 2, Gunsmith 5, Weaponsmith 3... the list goes on.  They just dont fit in a pve shooter on any build to stay around. Maybe in FFXIV or something where people make a living crafting. We dont have a market board to justify that.
---
So, to meet in the middle, no timer.
---
But only be able to switch in your camp or a teammate camp?
---
Greedy people legendary is a distraction seems to have fixed loot pool 
---
Ohhhhh
---
Like in that one song by the Country Man who is bad at telling time but good at drinking!
---
I'd love to join, would enjoy to hang out with some more mature players  👍
---
For this last reply I apologize; both for bothering you a third time, and for how this madness has caused you such pain. 
---
Not only to have your outlet taken, then be unjustly hung up for crimes you did not commit, with only the cause of your pain named as reason for dismissal &amp; damning, be given back said outlet again, just to have it taken away is a pain I can only admit to understand. 
---
I have had, and will have, your back sir. 
---
No. Just up to 3 prs req and you quick switch to that perk card for the taming
---
Regardless of your health, being killed with one shot is being killed with one shot. Players can still kill entire mobs on there own. It's called the Fatman. Needing anything is pointless unless you are going to balance everything.
---
You should only need enough for the appropriate perk card
---
I launch a lot of solo nukes. Thats why i require a lot of card respecs all the time. Farm-craft-nuke-craft-fight. Rinse and repeat 1 bloody card at a time...
---
But it benefits the server because so many come farm nuke zones for free!
---
Had this issue multiple times, ive given up on my base for now every time i move it i get the same error, even when building a whole new base somewhere else, ill wait for the pvp servers and try again i guess
---
Someone supposedly got the sun mask while he served hoped a bunch so don’t think it resets but could still be possible 
---
The game is not a democracy. Majority rule is really just mob rule, never a good idea. 
---
Us, supported by statistics: "No one is getting rare mask drops, please fix it!"
---
Bethesda: "It's working as designed. Maybe next time."
---
Us: "What have I been doing with my life?"

It was worth a shot...

I’ve got :

4 soldier

4 owl

3 giant 
---
2 beret 
---
Accounts for 3 days has it been 3 days ?
---
Not for those of us on console games. Writing a suggestion one character at a time, I would rather chew my foot off at the ankle. 
---
Is it still available? Or any other cosmetics?
---
I mean I dont mind it being a solution to the problem, but why is it so high up the list of ways to resolve a problem
---
I just hate that everybody can do everything. That everyone with 5 Intelligence can craft every single item in the game, etc...
---
Fallout is a RPG series.
---
How so? A controversial feature should be voted on. 
---
What about if u have to let all of them die like miserable robots :)
---
Oh no, nuking it isn't griefing. That adds a challenge. Blocking the robots is griefing.
---
Hey man are you available?
---
Not writing suggestions. Choosing from a list of like 2-4 options. 
---
4 will be fine you only need lvl 3 of animal friend the hard part is finding one of the tamable animals at one of the random spawns
---
I’ve tamed a level 91 legendary glowing deathclaw and idk what happen to it , I only have 3 points of charisma but I am level 150 plus 
---
Not in FO76 it doesn't.  Deep pocket only adds 50 carry weight across all 5 pieces, 1 calibrated shock adds 50 carry weight. A second one makes the total 100. 
---
The long load in times are most likely caused by the change they made to try to stop you from loading in until the game was done loading and no matter where you load your camp has to load first. Tested this with a character that doesn't have a camp and I load in much faster
---
It's worth having if you only use it when you are scrapping stuff.  Treat it like armorer, hacker, lockpick, etc. and it's worth it if you remember to swap it back to something useful when you're done.
---
/fo76filthycasuals come join us cause they don’t get it 
---
I think its just really rare. Hate all you like, and trust me I hate it too, the rarity of such items give it value. Given the number of times the event is run per day per server wth rewards given out to EVERY player, the odds must be really low.
---
And plus, only a fraction of all fo76 players are redditors. Some random dude might have one, who just doesn't care much to share.
---
Point is, long story short, being a player who bought a game doesn't entitle you to extremely rare content. It's just rngesus
---
The backyard junk heap is a really nice, creative touch.  Looks like the kind of place that would be featured in the American Pickers show.
---
That nuka-cola machine looks like a 2033 first edition "bubble" model in pretty good condition.  I'll offer you 500 for it right now, caps in hand, plus I have this super mutant pal and his brahmin that will help me haul it off your property.
---
Oh dang. I'm gonna miss my old deep pockets. 
---
Well that extra 300 points allows the level 300 player to have all perk cards, or close to it available to them, it also has given them time to complete their perk layout. While the level 50 may not have all of the perk cards available yet. Some builds take to like level 56 or a little higher to complete. Game time moving to a new server is a huge deal when it is a brand new server. 
---
Yep 
---
"Decide?"
---
I feel you. Three days of 8-10 hour sessions with groups of at least 4 up to 10 or more coordinating to complete the event and jump to the next. Not a single soul at the event landed a Death, Goblin, Harlequin, Sun or Old Man Winter mask. 
---
We have now tried testing by only letting the Death bot survive but have no results that show the method to be effective.
---
/rfo76FilthyCasuals will be more alighted with you. I agree but most of the subreddit here won’t 
---
I would still rather use reddit or go to the Bethesda.net site. 
---
I though about that I stayed on a server for 3 events then everyone in my party dc. That might work I guess we'll see i try staying on a server for a day. 
---
Half your level?  Since when? 
---
Getting the same plans three times in  a row made me want to just stop bothering with the quest (so i did).  Secondly, the event only lasts a week.  Every mask you obtain will be 'rare' by virtue of the fact that the event only lasts a week.  Any players who start the game  after the event is no longer offered can't obtain ANY of them. 
---
Pretty sure it’s prepper not trapper? But am also super excited.
---
When the events done tweet from fallout sorry something was messed up in the coding here have these free atom masks. 😂
---
At least they have no weight
---
Its their game, not ours. Bethesda has been abundantly clear on this, they will do what they want. We can voice our opinions, but the decision is ultimately up to them. Kind of like a representative government, but we can't vote them out of office. 
---
Yeah, the sloth loot is weak af. I barely bother shooting at him. I just keep my eyes peeled for bugs and wolves.  On a side note,  this last playthrough,  we had surprise additional suicide mutants in place of the usual wolves &amp; bugs. I was super pumped cuz I figured we would most likely get a rare drop because if it. Annnnddd.... Nothing :( Just another soldier mask to add to the collection. 
---
.. The point isn't to not have higher level players than yourself.
---
The point is to have a hardcore game mode for the character, and not just for when you want to log in and play pvp.
---
This means you have a survival character that is only playing on those rules, and to encourage people to *play* survival mode as survival mode, and not just as a pvp option for the day.
---
Definitely works
---
Hurk, right you are!   
---
Though apparently it's both? o.0  
---

Iv'e never had issues with my camp being attacked.

Then again i have 7 Missile turrets waiting to melt anyone who gets an evil idea.
---
Works for me haha!
---
Bro if you need your helium fix so bad just go to the moon, they got it all over the place and the Hive don't mind sharing. No need to hurt the Gjally over this.
---
It is their game. And if they were smart they would take player feedback like they keep saying they want. 
---
Why are against the players making some choices regarding gameplay or game modes? 
---
I see bicycles around everywhere... makes me wish I'd learned how to ride a bicycle in the vault. :(
---
That is beautiful. I want to play 
---
I would be interested in joining
---
Every time I hear it, I start singing the lyrics to another familiar song in my head.  Here's a [link to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSB2TMFVkbI).  I think many of you know it, and either love it or hate it.
---
If I am short on ammo I won't go
---
How did you manage that?
---
People are going to get to the best gear eventually anyway.
---
If you cannot bring gear over from Adventure into Survival then a month or two down the road no one new can join Survival because they'll have to start a fresh character into a world where everyone at this point has the best gear.
---
You should be able to bring a character and gear into whatever game mode you want. This way new players can learn the game and get gear in Adventure and then jump over to Survival and already have some gear, instead of getting wiped out by the people who started Survival earlier.
---
In the same way people can then take what they earn in Survival back over to Adventure mode.
---
its always been like that you have to be double the lvl of what you are trying to tame
---
DM you on reddit or discord? And if discord, what is your discord name?
---
I plan on trying tomorrow after work
---
Right on! I’ll DM you the link
---
I got into it late. From what I hear the stability has improved significantly. I personally miss the NPCs of fallout 4 and the multiple endings, but I get that they wanted to expand to multiplayer and that's created other issues. 
---
But some vault NPCs would be nice IMO. 
---
Since you last played BETA, I'd say give it a shot. Let the experience guide your decision. 
---
DMing the link to you right now.
---
Or exactly Midnight GMT
---
Thanks
---
Just on here aha, but I’ll DM you the Link right now. 
---
I honestly would forgive any and all clipping just to see my weapon. I'd take clipping models over magic guns that appear out of nowhere any day lol
---
Really unsure. Think it's something similar to the headless glitch being caused by the masks. 
---
But a very large portion of the player base, do not use reddit. And I am not sure of the statistics for Bethesda.net because I only cost their for the inside the vaults. If there are 1 million active players, and this sub has 170kish subscribers, that is like 5%. 
---
That’s why this game lost so many players. 
---
Yep.  I was HOPING that they took notice of the 3000 odd upvoted post months ago when they first announced Survival.  I am not interested in pvping against people that duped excellent weapons and or received them.
---
It really is a missed opportunity to not only retain Fallout 76 pvp players but far more importantly, add new players or returning players to the game.  I know of many players that have said they won't bother with Survival (which sounds and looks great) if people can bring existing players into the mode.  
---
Really poor judgement I'm afraid.  I'll stay playing The Division 2 thank you.  
---
Sounds great.
---
I love you thanks for the response!!! I follow it all except the pillar glitch to stack them part. That's the only part I'm lost on. 
---
They do accept player feedback. The idea of the adventure mode is due to player feedback. Ultimately the game is the brainchild of the developers. They will only make changes that they are willing to make. They are trying to create a narrative, and want to stick with it. That is why you have devs or their representatives replying and engaging players on reddit and in game. All the players could vote to get rid of the Atom store, but BGS would not do it. Thinking that just because a few people want something does not mean it will happen. It is called life. We can't always get what we want. If you think you can, then you had a lot of people lying to you as you grew up. 
---
Haha, wonder how that managed to get up there. 
---
Or... They're just... Rare?   
---
As stated?
---
I maybe dont think they should use the polling stations in game for decisions, but certainly something from at least the main menu of the game, so only people who have and actually play the game can make decisions on it (and not people who try to sabotage it for whatever reason they have)
---
Clever. 
---
I've had it spawn as a 2 star before 
---
consoles can use a keyboard nowadays , just to let you know, plug in a usb keyboard and type away.
---
No they just use the same ammo 
---
Exactly 
---
Then you just flat out fail XD. Atleast that is a new age solution for a new age problem.
---
Bethesda.  Ask Blizzard why they didn't and don't allow pvp players and pve players swapping freely between realms.  Seriously.  Pick up the phone and ask them if you're unsure of online game development.
---
Point of view. Its irrelevant for me. People with better stuff = more difficult for you to survive but hey you just dont want that.  And again op weapons and gears are not a problem when you have good stuff, chems and build.
---
Hmm, well maybe I’ll pass then haha
---
No it hasnt
---
Lets just not play it until bethesda listens to our concerns and demands
---
Yeah, that level 45 locked gear is going to work out real swell on the level 5 alt. 
---
Mine is an Instigating Meat Hook.  Obviously the target has to be full health but just a casual hit with it will do 600+ without sneak, boosts, etc(200% repaired).  40% power damage would boost it even further, I'd guess around 900 with a power attack.  There is no doubt in my mind that the meat hook is the best unarmed/1 handed weapon in the game, a super sledge might rival it for 2 handed. The Death Tambo is close and is pretty damn cool, Ski Sword and Combat Knife for 1 handed.
---
If you had the setup to be able to sneak on a Behemoth, with the right perks the meat hook is ridiculous. 
---
It happened to me today. I went with my friend at the same time to get the quest and it gave me his quest too. He got his Wine quest and it showed up on mine.
---
Then I talked to Biv and he gave me the craft the Hoppy Hunter quest. After I completed mine, I drank wine and it said to go buy an item from a vendor. I bought something but it didn't complete it. I logged out for the night but will report if I can complete it tomorrow.
---
I did that actually!  And you know what!  I uninstalled it again lmao 
---
You can go outside the nuke zone and kill critters for the intestines too
---
Except people have been duping gear and receiving duped gear for months.  No thanks sport.
---
I am talking about things such as “A: Survival mode requires players to make a new toon or B: let players use existing toons” thing like that, the things that there are a million different posts about on this sub, those are the sort of things that should get player input. Not wether or not to remove features. You are misinterpreting my suggestion. Bethesda gives us the choices, they decide the choices we get to choose from. We get the final choice of what we want that Bethesda is willing to do. 
---
Shoutout to the OP for potentially generating more awareness to the community by posting this.
---
Huge shoutout all you data miners who helps us all decide how to save and spend our Atoms ahead of time. This info is always huge for a guy like me and o know for a fact I’m not alone.
---
You are truly appreciated. 
---
PS4 been very laggy for the past hour or so. Hits not registering etc 
---
They seem to be one in 3333 about, so yeah pretty rare
---
Yep, that’ll probably be me when I try it out. The vision Todd sold at their presentation of the game where it’s still Fallout but with that extra tension was cool. 
---
Last time I played, some dude with an apparently stealth sniper build came at me for my bounty while I was in my camp. It was a pretty fun back and forth trying to locate him and take him out before he moved. But if one or both of us were one of those min maxers.... bleh.
---
I do agree after thinking about it the polling booths in game is not the best choice. I was in a hurry when I wrote this. The main menu would be a better place and more visible. 
---
Can they not launch live brahmin?  
---
Also looks good, very similar to the guy who was laying siege to flatwoods the other day
---
PERFECT! Now you didn't waste the space on the forum about it. I just see so many of them I feel like this should be the go to. Like, unless you have to delete a different game to make the space for it, there's seriously no loss. Star the download when you go to sleep, play the next day, delete afterwards, and repeat in 3-6 months. And you will be the unsung hero of the forums because you made one less "should I play again?" Post. 
---
:( You don't need an exploit to hit 50 in a day.. We just like grinding. We aren't nerds. 
---
Yes but that fresh start won't include the shit tonne of duplicated gear and weapons will it.  I know a heap of people, including many that didn't purchase the game due to the reviews it received, that would have been interested in this mode otherwise.
---
Your first mistake was drinking Coca-Cola to stay awake.  You need a Nuka Cherry!
---
Everyone is getting tired. Every run I've done today has had less than five players. One time it was just me and one other person (didn't make it). A player in another thread just said he had to do it alone. I think after the news dropped that this is exactly the way the devs wanted it, everyone got discouraged. (I don't blame them).
---
Three days of grinding, almost 10,000 combined runs (from the survey, so probably a much higher number), has got the vast majority of us bupkis.
---
The servers are still full too, people are just moving on to other things, or getting back to nuking the shit out of whitesprings to grind for legendarys again.
---
If the devs had said "That's the way we made it, but we forgot to factor in the short time the event is available, there's nothing we can do about it now, we are sorry." Then I'd feel a little less defeated about the whole situation.
---
The five people worldwide that got the supposed rare drops are going to make a mint on eBay. If Bethesda hasn't completely plugged the duping hole, they'll be widely available soon enough.
---
No Brahmin were harmed during the construction of this game
---
I don't always spawn in the same location when I fast travel. It would always be somewhere on the edge of the build radius but not always in the same spot. Sometimes I would end up on my platform, sometimes under, sometimes on rocks nearby
---
Easy solution. Up until level 50 or so you’re placed with only people level 50 and under. Anything after that and you’re fair game with everyone else. That should give you PLENTY of time to get some good gear 
---
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen! 😂
---
Yep. Just never a single one in 76. Not one single time. Nor my friends, or co-workers who play on Xbox and PC, nor any one I play Rocket League with who also plays 76. 
---
Because griefing in 76 is not nearly as bad as the perception provided by this sub. It's just we see people complaining about it here and they are vocal. This sub always thinks their opinions/experience are on par with the entire game's player base, which it isn't. 
---
This game has no where near the level of griefing as other titles. Fuck, Rocket league has bigger issues with it. 
---
It's like my home town. We have a meme page. It features drunken/dirt bag locals doing drunken/dirtbag things.... 
---
Yet, when looked at over all, outside of that specific lens, the actual population of drunken/dirtbag locals is miniscule compared to the population as a whole. 
---
Thanks for sharing this, i'm still awaiting for non-robot response. 
---
I’ve been having this problem pretty bad lately as well, like crafting stations in certain locations won’t even load in. 
---
Stagger / boom
---
Considering i didn't know it was something to look for until just now i have no idea. Exactly my point. Didnt even play tonight because my fiance fell asleep early and the light tends to keep her up
---
Also if you remember people were recruited for many many reasons and at some point they started recruiting regular people and giving them military training. Scribes weren't always military
---
Trading is annoying period. I sometimes feel like a dick ignoring trade requests (not really) but it's a pain in the ass and I'd sooner grind. You wanna trade? Get on mic and ask.
---
That is how it should be period.  To even suggest something like that shows Bethesda's failure at promoting an online game.  Excellent single player developer but incredibly stupid online developer, especially when just 10 minutes of research on previous games will answer any questions.
---
It would be nice to actually have questions asked to us by bethesda and have a definitive yes or no answer to weather we agree with it or not though, instead of just "were listening to your feedback"  
---
But they have even said themselves, not everyone who plays is on reddit, but, everyone who plays will see the main screen of the game so it would include the whole community in decision making 
---
https://youtu.be/HvBalc5hfQA
---
I tried it again later at night. Also had no server drops. Might have been a region/timezone thing.
---
I saw a level 26 with partial excavator armor so I made them full and modded, dropped what known plans I had, a few full Fusion cores. It's nice to help others 
---
Sometimes they have a chance to not spawn. And if you just log in, it doesn't always load in right away
---
Exactly well put.
---
Almost time to throw my raider flair back on.
---
Your first sentence basically sums up it up.  
---
How many players do you think play the game!
---
It won't be many fucking more if you make ridiculous decisions like transferring characters and allowing existing characters now will it.  Even the most basic business and marketing decisions could tell you the answer to attracting new or returning players.  
---
That's stupid. Sounds like Someone either trying to scare newbs or what not. The stuff over there are under level 5 no?
---
Yeah I do not see a point in turrets. They never protected my camps. I was always repairing stuff
---
yeh i know..trading with randoms is not one of my fave things to do..but i mean when you have a trade lined up from marketplace76 its annoying to have to close app all the time just to dona trade
---
They are not very transparent on what kind of feed back they want or listen to. They have implemented a few things that were suggested, but it usually takes a HUGE uproar to make it happen. 
---
reading your post and the comments, i'm glad i'm not the only one. I'm on vacation right now and playing on my laptop wich has slightly less specs compared to my desktop pc. I was thinking it would be the specs of my laptop making loading and rendering go more slowly. And maybe that is for a part of it. But reading here that more people encounter this problem and that another part of this problem is server sided, it kinda eases my mind :P
---
I see them too but I've seen low level legendary stuff in there too like uhhh okay I'll take that thank you
---
Na a Nukashine would be be better because i would wake up somewhere different far from this game.
---
Nice.
---
I'm not saying it wont work, I'm saying theres loads of people like me who just wont want to play on an unfair playing field, I dont have a TSE weapon so I'm at a disadvantage to PvP, I know this from everytime someone PvP's with me in game currently, if they have a TSE, its not worth it since its just them stood somewhere 1 shotting anything that moves with their unyielding sentinels armor so they dont take any damage either
---
If you are on PC there's a mod called Perk Loadout Manager that does just that. And it's great! You can save 12 presets.
---
Touche.
---
True I just hate cluttered inventory space and I was concerned it would prevent me from getting other Silo Bravo codes. Thankfully rebooting the game deleted them from my inventory and they’re all dropping correctly. Weird glitch, though. 
---
Me and the team I play with have been starting the event and getting through to the parade starting and suddenly the whole server shows up. Bunch of freeloaders, also half just sit at the end and wait for others to get the bots there. I watched the same player in 3 events show up and then just sit in the shed with the weapons workbench the whole time, and they were a level 300+.
---
Here, take my upvote!  
---
Nice camp
---
If you’re nothing people who want nothing to do with it, then yes it does.
---
Curious, why are you looking for it? 
---
That's good. I figured worst case scenario is wait till the new week starts
---
Interesting, I wonder if it is related to something else. Maybe an obstruction or natural terrain causes it to fluctuate. 
---
The camp I have now, I've fast traveled to it several dozen times and I always end up right in the same spot on the edge of the build radius 100% of the time, even across multiple days and game sessions. 
---
Why are you here then? To make snide remarks to people who actually like the game?
---
Oh I end up on the edge it's just where on the edge that changes. 
---
I agree completely. When I saw the announcement that you could freely choose what mode to play with the same character I was so glad. I like using one character, so I don't want to have to level up another just to play survival. I'm not super high leveled or geared either, I'm level 99 and my best weapon is a 1 star instigating handmade. I just have 0 desire to level another character. 
---
Oh god the sound. It so damn loud when it plays it for like 30 items
---
This is why the event should have a set of time instead 60 minutes after the previous event started. Bethesda should set the event to start every hour on the XX:00
---
I doubt everything you just said tbh but do you 
---
You’re about at the top capacity.
---
 Now is where weight reduction perks come into play. 
---
Most specifically weapon weight reduction from legendary armor. Which can’t be applied in power armor.
---
The other weight reduction perks work in power armor because they are perk cards, not a legendary effect on armor.
---
This community makes griefing in this game out to be this huge common problem which it isn't. Does it exist? I'm sure it does. It's just not this wide spread problem everyone here makes it out to be, otherwise where's all these servers just filled with wanted players.... 
---
Not to mention that this sub's definition of griefed vs actually being griefed is not even close. 
---
"A high level guy killed me one time" - Not griefing
---
"I just took over the munitions factory and a party of four one shotted me" -Not griefing. 
---
"A guy attacked my camp to try to draw me into PvP" - Not Griefing
---
Show me the endless hours of gameplay showcasing actual grieifing... If it's as common as this sub makes it out to be, even if only a sliver record it, there should be scores of hours of video. 
---
I'm almost positive they let this slip through to hype us up for shear terror
---
My experience supports this. I did a quest around 11am the other day and there was a new one available at 9pm that night. I thought to myself, "Woah, the timer must be less than 12 hours." The next day, I logged in around 11am again (14 hours later) and didn't get a new quest. I was really confused. But if the quests actually just reset at 8pm, that makes perfect sense.
---
Easily solved by matchmaking.  You know, that formula that pretty much every single online developer have been using for years.  Levels 1 -25, 26 - 50, 51 - 75, 75 - 100 and 101+
---
It may overvalue the rare items, but it sure as hell makes me start to devalue Bethesda.
---
It's absolutely not the point. 
---
If it were the point, Bethesda could have just made an arena map...
---
Seriously? Relax dude, it's just a game. No wonder gaming companies make so much money off microtransactions. Who gives a shit, its just a digital mask.
---
I’m sure someone has one to trade. I gave mine away. 
---
The second thing..
---
Not sure why you’re on this sub then... 
---
Great job.  The bloatflies didn't work out btw.  Corpses kept turning to meat piles, but I did figure out a way to propel myself a thousand meters.
---
How about Matchmaking servers by player level.  Its a ludicrous idea!
---
If you don't like it . Stay in adventure mode. Problem solved 
---
I think you can only lay out two at a time, I remember when I got to a certain number the first one would explode, then the second, third, etc. if I kept laying them down. I think it was two.. I can hardly remember
---
I am continually amused with how this sub thinks it's opinions reflect that of the whole player base.
---
I assumed they would’ve had an outfit plan or something :( thanks for the help though 
---
It’ll probably scale to how many enemies and their level. 
---
I just started playing again, and I keep running into the same issue.  The level scaling is just getting to me; when players are like 200+ and spawning high level enemies, and I'm just level 12. It takes so long to do damage to anything and then all my shit breaks anyway!
---
Thumbs up from me, but anytime you voice an actual opinion on Reddit, the comments section turns into a complete shitshow within minutes.  This has to be one of the most disagreeable forums I've ever followed, almost like some people are on here for the sake of instigation.  
---
And I'll end that small comment to allow more room for the "ur stupede lol", "I disagree because...", "you're doing it wrong" and "if you think this subreddit is bad, check out xyz".  
---
And yes, I've been the guy that says "I disagree because..." and follows it with an essay, only to be baited into a rapidly degenerating argument that annoys me for the rest of the day.
---
I'm beginning to learn for my mistakes.
---
Check the dispenser again?
---
Can you imagine if this dropped with furious
---
It's probably going to come with one of the updates. 
---
So apparently you can’t get it back without someone else... if anyone on Xbox One has one they would be willing to part with, I would greatly appreciate it. My GT is CJManUfan
---
I think you may be the only reasonable person on this sub.
---
yeah if it doesnt glitch out
---
I tried that and it didn’t give me anything 
---
I've heard rose all over the map even though I've already finished her thing
---
I support the use of IN GAME voting . Only because it would mean only people who owned the game voted. But I CAN NOT support this because that also means people with multiple accounts would be the voice for the majority . Good idea. Just need to be executed correctly 
---
You think Fallout 76 has a griefing problem?
---
you sir, said it well!  
---
I used the perk card mod before you needed to use the perk website as input. That worked great. Ever since you have to use that website i find it not anny fun to work with.  
---
There really should be an ingame perk preset manager. I think 4 or 5 presets should be enough. I had these slots:  
---
1 overall PVE preset
---
2 lockpicking and hacking
---
3 Weight reducing
---
4 crafting
---
&gt;No you don't lol.
---
&gt;No, you're not.
---
I've never met you, so how the hell would you know? Are you personally following me around the game to check? No? Then don't speak about things you know *literally nothing* about.
---
&gt;It's not about being a fresh start, it's about getting the massive amount of dupes out of the system. Again, I've got hundreds of hours played and I've never once had a TSE drop, or a bloodied explosive for that matter. It takes a lot to farm those kinds of god roll weapons for your average player (someone did the math in a reddit thread once, a perfect god roll drop takes about 700 hours of farming on average based on current drop chances). Sure there will be a lucky person here or there who has some fairly quickly on the server, but after the first two weeks most people aren't even going to be max level let alone having high end gear.
---
The dupes are *gone*. There's nobody with a stack of 10,000 TSE gatling guns any more, and the vast majority of people doing that shit were banned.
---
You're seeking a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.
---
&gt;There is no such thing as not having the time to start again it's having the drive to go through starting again that you lack. If you played for 40 minutes every other day, you'd still be able to get back to where you are right now in a month or two. That's not even that big of a deal.
---
Ah, so you know how much free time my schedule allows for too? You sure know a lot about me for someone who's never met me or even spoken to me before.
---
Look. I'm glad you don't have to work and don't have any bills to pay, and can sit around and grind for 12+ hours a day, but not all of us are so lucky. 
---
In the mean time, I don't need a finger-wagging lecture from someone who clearly has nothing better to do with their time than play video games all day. Try talking to me when you have some actual responsibilities in life.
---
what led you to believe it was dope?
---
I just ran it solo until the frogs started spawning, then some jackass nuked Helvetia.
---
Didn't have power armor, I just left.
---
I agree entirely.  I actually have theory that the posts about rerolling for survival are the same trolls, that posted all the hate for this game before even playing it. Duping is still ingame anyone who really thinks they will get a fresh start is an idiot. It will take less than a week for a God roll to drop and get duped. Guess what the dupers will trade their God rolls with other dupers and then only the dupers will have the best items and they wont be for sale. How's that for a fresh start? At least now every one has access to the same stuff. I have also heard complaints about high lvls, it's like they are playing a different game. There is no difference build wize from a lvl 55 and a lvl 300, plan your points and the builds are identical.
---
Tesla gun is must have on end if you want to do it solo. Those wolves can't survive electricity.
---
Except they got rid of all the stacks of duped gear people had, so that reasoning makes no sense either.
---
Hahaha. At the SBQ some doink was spamming melee on me and straight up trying to jump into my bullets so he could take my boss loot for like 5 minutes straight. Like, you look foolish right now sir. Lol. 
---
It's so saddening too for some of us. My group of friends and I were really excited to collect them all together but now none of us want to spend the time doing it. None of us have even seen one in game yet. This is one of those times where I kinda hope the dupers are still active so that we are able to get these masks, because otherwise there's no way 99.9999999% of people will ever get one.
---
Yeah, so I don't do that either. Just make do with what I get from playing the game. Weird concept, I know.
---
Roll a new character on Survival mode.
---
You cannot transfer characters between modes.
---
Matchmaking servers from level 1 -25, 26 - 50, 51 - 75, 76 - 100 and 100+
---
Gain new and returning players.
---
End of story.
---
Thats the exact thing i already called for some days ago. Its just like in Fallout 4, where the way it should have been is that you have the factions fight over settlements and build their own unique bases there with the settlers being either their accomplices or slaves.
---
This would be literally the same with workshops in Fallout 76. Just have the scorched claim workshops, or the supermutants and build up bases there from which they start sending patrols and assault forces. Have the super mutants spawn behemoths that way that are sent like a heat seeking missile as part of an attack force onto other workshops so they expand their influence.
---
Let the damn wars begin !
---
kill, quest, kill some more and then do some more quests! :)
---
And it seems like you just want to bring everybody else to a clean slate because you're jealous of their equipment.
---
There's nothing preventing anybody from obtaining the same equipment in Adventure, or just buying it from another player.
---
Matchmaking via levels champ.  Look it up
---
I dont really know, but like I said , I didnt do anything. literally all I did was walked around and didnt even shoot anything and still got the same mask as everyone else and the donut plans as well. 
---
&gt;Except the majority of god roll (mostly TSE) weapons are from exploits. More than once I've been on a server at white springs and someone was handing out TSE's to people before the exploits were finally removed. They were there for months. For MONTHS people were duping items and selling/distributing them to players.
---
Except all those stacks of duped weapons were deleted. You want a TSE? Go find one in Adventure, or spend the caps and buy one from another player. Nothing's stopping you from doing so.
---
You just got me to want to play again...
---
Damn. Guess I'm done grinding this event. Nice going bethesda
---
i couldnt tell you becuase I have no idea what type off build you want or trying to do. 
---
So this confused me. I just modded my excavator PA with calibrated shocks (I only did one leg due to lack of Flux) and it raised it only 25. Am I missing something? I also bought the plans to build new legs with the shocks. Would that make it 50?
---
Any of the mixed drinks in the mixed drinks alcohol crafting menu, like Hard Lemonade, Lead Champagne xxx x3, Tick Blood xxx x3, etc. The ones that craft x3 are easier to do since you get 3 at a time.
---
Hell yea, in pvp if melee won’t do the trick I switch to my assassins pump action. That means getting rid of melee cards, and putting all the shotguns. Plus crafting, I’d love to have a crafting preset that I can to to craft my shit better and faster. 
---
Off topic, but I remember being a paid Runescape member, and spent forever getting a high slayer level, allowing me the ability to kill monsters with the chance at extremely rare loot. I was excited, and so was everyone else who got to that level. Even though it was super rare and I spent weeks (and never got one too), there was always that sense of fun and thrill.
---
I wonder where that has gone for a lot of video game players nowadays.
---
This is strait from the game files knock yourself out my dude/dudet
---
I did it over 20times and still don't have even beret i was hoping i get. (Gonna buy it on market as event end)
---
If you let bots die, you have less chance to get mask. With 1-2 death bots you have 85% to get mask. With 3-4 death bots you have 50% to get mask.  So leting them die result to you gettin only recipe.
---
TECH me plz 
---
This is a awesome idea. How has no one mentioned this already 
---
I’ll trade it to you for some caps? I’ll sell it low
---
I was fine till this event I payed 80 dollars I was ok with that but this set me over the edge. Because they have shit communication during this event its like they don't even care anymore how there community responds. I love the game it has a lot of potential but they need people to believe they are trying to make a comeback. 
---
No, because I want to PVP, you completely missed my point.
---
Make a new character shouldn't take long to power through to that part
---
how much? I only have 250 or so, I just got back into the game 
---
Ive seen it sold by the vendor inside the fire station. But that might’ve been from other players who pawned theirs off to him.
---
50?
---
I guess I won't be playing survival mode until they disable the character transfer stuff or  balance those ridiculous weapons out. I'm getting really tired of being one shoted/respawn/then get killed again and again immediately just after respawning.... by those high levels bulliers in adventure mode.
---
:(
---
I’ll take that! Should I just PM you when I’m free? I’m going to bed in a minute 
---
Not out till the 26th. Just announced it.
---
Sure thing.
---
I give a big thumbs up for that saying.........👍
---
I predicted this months ago. Kill the Carebears like a proper Game Master the game must be codified in blood and tears.
---
[Why do we play games?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5jDspIC4hY)

I'm still waiting for a call from the future.  I'll keep you posted ;)
---
For the love of god, make it only fresh chars. Here i was thinking about starting on fallout again, on the new game mode. But not a chance if im just gonna get bullied by migrated people
---
A very large portion of people in every game do not participate in any of the forums. That is their choice. 
---
Thank you a lot! You're the man of the day!
---
My camp is on a cliff ledge... I spawn to my death every time
---
I don't want to change your mind, but perhaps I can settle it. I agree that there is no best rifle, it's about having the right tool for every job. I design each of my weapons to complement and synergize with my own perks and tactics. Every mod has a purpose. I'm still rocking vanilla weapons in the hunt for legendary upgrades (you do the best with what you have), but this is my typical loudout (ymmv):

True,  but now griefers can’t kill by “death from 1000 cuts”.
---
So what does that have to do with Bethesda giving them the option to participate via the game? I know for a fact a lot of people left this sub because of the attitude that people display. Why would giving them the option to try and make the game better without being subject to the negativity of places like this be a bad thing?
---
Best. Response. 
---
Three players firing on the same guy with high ROF two shot weapons makes the 5hp per hit tear away with a lot of friends.
---
Yeah I only use wood armor so I definitely don't want the drop rate lowered, would love to actually be able to get 2* or 3* ones though. 
---
oh man i'm gonna lock so many people in my camp and here's the best part they cant fast travel out because the cats that naturally spawn at my base are considered an enemy 
---
&gt;  I have no TSE or Bloodied weapons, i'm even don't know current meta.
---
If you go into Survival, you will get oneshot by everyone else using Bloodied builds, and won't be able to deal any damage in return because they're using full Sentry armor, because they were allowed to import their characters. Do you really want that? Does that honestly sound like fun to you, getting instakilled with no chance to retaliate? People like you who don't already have a meta build benefit the most from forcing everyone to restart.
---
No, it should be 50 per leg
---
An issue I could see with this is swapping load outs mid fight. For example, if you're fast enough or have a macro or something, you could switch to a heavy weapons build, then switch to a melee build when something's close, basically meaning you get the benefits of having both builds at once (strength builds in particular would be even more powerful than they already are).
---
Maybe just have a separate area for utility cards like lockpicking?
---
I'd love that. 
---
I have cats at my base that spawn there i cant fast travel away because of them so i could just lock my doors and presto your screwed buddy
---
The only reason anyone would ever kit their player out with op armour is for pvp or griefing. (There may be a small portion for pve)
---
 Not alot of people want to pvp as we've seen heaps of people complain about not wanting to do it and getting griefed. 
---
So obviously everyone will spend hours kitting their player out for this very moment. While I agree it'll be rough with the duped items.
---
 What's the point of working so hard farming and trading in adventure mode if you can't put all that effort into pvp? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Kinda wish they would fix little things before any of this tbh. I came back after a couple of months away from the game and the first parade i did i received no loot nor rewards, then at nuked fissure site took down 3 star queen which also gave no loot, landed plenty of shots on both bosses. Why the hell would i put effort into 2 different game modes when little shit like that, makes the game still feel completely broken. Might wait another couple of months, but i fear by then ill be completely out of touch with the game.
---
How many people do you think have enough account to throw off a vote of say 500,000 people (Bethesda states it is in the millions I believe)? I do agree it would have to be implemented properly. How exactly I don’t know.  
---
Someone posted this on facebook about the issue. It's up to you if it's genuine or not
---
[https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/54398935\_10218405450748761\_1439663047525269504\_n.jpg?\_nc\_cat=111&amp;\_nc\_ht=scontent-atl3-1.xx&amp;oh=b9e44854c6f1111a39b4ecce7458d129&amp;oe=5D204A86](https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/54398935_10218405450748761_1439663047525269504_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.xx&amp;oh=b9e44854c6f1111a39b4ecce7458d129&amp;oe=5D204A86)
---
Dupping is still happening but that seems to be the only way to get good weapons these days. I've played over 250hrs and never once had a TSE or a sent/Cav armor drop. Every good weapon/armor I have now have been bought and no doubt some were dupped. Now I just sell what I've picked up on drops in order to save up for better stuff. It's getting Expensive now though so I think I will be stagnant in my build for a while. 
---
Well. To be fare . You can get 76 on eBay for 5$ now....so
---
we had one time 2 off them die still got a mask and extra plans. l
---
I agree. I do not feel I represent anyone but me. I would like to see a way for the whole player base a chance to decide certain major aspects of the game. 
---
Lol you serious? That takes resources and new code. Not worth it.
---
And that path is on the survival servers.  Don’t like it?  Play another game.   
---
Genuine or not, I appreciate the information. Thank you. 
---
i really dont have anything in mind, I am a melee build and im looking for something better than the All Rise, but im open for anything. 
---
You don’t think you should have a say in what is done to the game you paid for? 
---
I say, remove all legendary equipment. Then it's all player skill, perks, and recipes/plans. No such thing as legendary gear in real life, my ar-15 is just like your ar-15 (now with tacti-cool!).
---
Granted, there will be less reason to use legendary trash gear (ie. Nocturnal wood armor, or ghoul killing gamma guns lol), and therefore everyone will use combat armor and power armor. 
---
But people will fight back and likely kill him there!
---
Lmao what an oddly specific way to communicate that you think it would be better that people just grind adventure first. 
---
Where does the VTU outfit spawn in the world?
---
😂😂😂
---
Speak for yourself,  my friends and I (total level about 415 between the three of us) use workshops for materials and plans.
---
Players are good at identifying problems.
---
But when you let the players decide the *solutions* to those problems ... it usually doesn't turn out well.   
---
People go to school to study game design. It's their *job* and you've literally already paid them to do it.
---
There is something wrong if someone buys enough accounts to skew the results by any tangible margin (assuming a large number of the player base votes). 
---
Not a believable enough answer to convince /u/Ladydevann or u/Valseek to say it, so you had to use this account. LOL
---
Yeah, but what you ask for is unrealistic and not efficient in any way shape or form.
---
Now only read and yes the same problem exists with me too !!!!!
---
In the loot pool of the Cranberry Bog(maybe others, I dunno) you can get a Responders Fireman Outfit. Its similar to the Fire Breather outfit but with some Blue/White bits and a Responder logos in place of the WVFD ones.
---
In my opinion it's better and could be a good replacement 
---
Personally. I think a new character shouldn’t force per say but the key into survival. Example. Getting your survival character to 50 will allow all your level 50 characters to join on survival.  This way you’ve earned you place to use your ultra one shot build, however you acquired it. 
---
If nothing else make it level selected when starting. Or bracketed. Being level 15 and having X hours will allow you to survive with others. 
---
I've only got both in one day once. 
---
Seriously, unless we get weekly resets then there will always be players with much better loot than others. But that's the point of this, if you play more you get better stuff
---
Have you been playing the same game I have? Who ever is in charge of content is not making the best decision in my opinion. I see nothing wrong with giving the players some thing such as “A-things go this way B- things go this different way or C- things go this way”. Simple choices. I am not suggesting the players choose how to change the whole game. Just aspects of it. 
---
Ding!   Welcome to the New Reality.  
---
An alternate way to do things would be to make *three* modes - Adventure, Survival, and Survival+ or some similar name, then let players port their characters from Adventure to Survival but not from Adventure to Survival+
---
I doubt Bethesda would do things that way but hey, it's one way that everybody can win out of this.
---
How so? 
---
I don't know if you tagged that sloth, or didn't and he still managed to bug out.  This isn't a way to avoid having to tag a mob for exp/loot.
---
Just that after a few times of having it happen, with many players around and without, that removing a limb from the bugged out creature *can* resolve the "still standing" glitch.  I do not think this will do anything for mobs that are "spinning arrows", it's pretty exclusive to the "still standing" bug.
---
Im wated right for the same reason, the workshop was claimed . I was in the area picked the lock on a locker and now i have a 10 cap bounty. if I would had known that could had happened I would just started PVP with the actual player. 
---
p.s. someone come kill me and get them 10 caps (XBOX)
---
The perks that cut food + aid down to 10% of its base weight is insanely good
---
If I want to type on a console, I will buy a gaming computer. 
---
Where’s the pic?
---
my bad, uploaded without a my Tag on it, gimme just a second chief :)
---
I feel ya. My only triumph in PVP was to be an annoying little shit to two level 100's who kicked me off a workshop. I destroyed their fusion generator and junk producer but got killed at Least four times and lost all my caps. Just reached lvl50 and have killed my first SBs (I didn't think that possible). I'm dead in 5secs with a legendary mirelurk king. PVP sucks but at least you can avoid it most of the time.
---
How about an actual washing machine.bit requires pure water, About, industrial solvent, and one if each flux to get a clean outfit version. It could be part of an actual quest line to help the lowly appliance salesman in Watoga.
---
I'm really enjoying F76, it's the only game I've been playing for the past 3 months. I'm coming up on 300hrs playtime. I installed it after I purchased it, and it's the only time that I've installed it.
---
But I still have one question: should I play it again?
---
Good post
---
Hahahaha anyone who pay that is a fucking joke what a rip-off
---
I did not downvote for the record. 
---
Its also a Survival in plenty of ways, which mean being self sufficient is the end goal. 
---
You should be epected to be able to make everything late game. Unless you're roleplaying as some kind of combat crazy idiot with only 1 INT but you would need to rely on a team to make stuff for you.
---
Yeah, it's pretty broken. The quest lines naturally direct you to Whitesprings before level 20, where you get destroyed by max-level ghouls. Best to ignore the quests for a bit. Go explore the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap. Do some events. Farm some caps and plans. Put together a suit of PA.

Enjoy all!

Why not just survival new characters only
---
That actually is really good. 
---
Nice
---
I like how you Incorporated the Jeep.
---
Well...yes. Even though you all seem to love grandstanding about even playing fields or whatever bullshit. Just admit your selfishness and insecurities. That's all I want. 
---
Hahahahaha. 
---
This, a million times. Biggest QoL boost the game can have right now
---
Everyone has keyboard nowadays.
---
Only noticed it when my team was stomping around in PA. 
---
Saw a guy with the skull mask. I’m a little sad reading this thread because it seem likely I won’t get my hands on one.
---
*holstered fat man*
---
I don't think it makes much difference. If a level 100+ or usually two come up against you (below 50) you're dead regardless of legendary equipment. They need to have a system where you can only initiate PVP in the same level band 0-20, 21-40 etc. Or you could have it that the rewards for killing players below you, diminishes greatly based on where your levels are at. E.g 0 caps for killed anyone more than 20 levels below you.
---
35000 caps deal ! 
---
Someone posted something similar in another thread. So from the sound of it, some people were still walking around with monstrous inventories where as others won't, but because the former anybody suspended got re-suspended.  Comically enough there are several unsuspended people with huge mules walking around lately. Ever wonder why there are witch costumes and other oddities in the vendors lately?
---
You can still kill friends and teammates with traps. You make a spring loaded trap under the mat and toss them off a cliff. Gravity is a harsh mistress 
---
Lol, yeah I saw a video on how to do that. 
---
More often than not, I'm playing in a party with 1-3 other good friends I've met in the wasteland.  
---
If we're scattered across the map, stealth doesn't seem to be affected (barring a buried mole rat that refuses to come out of the ground and will keep you in \[danger\] until you get away from it's follow radius.  Yes it still happens, albeit very rarely now).  The only particular time I can think of it actually working and being aware of staying concealed is when we do Horde events as a group, and each of us travels to a different zone looking for the 3-star boss.  When I find it, I alert everyone to travel to me so we can slay the boss together and share legendary loot, and stay concealed until they all port in.
---
If you're together with your pals stealth doesn't seem adversely affected by their presence, but hard to say.  Between a buddy or three, nothing stays alive long enough to notice.  I normally don't bother sneaking around, since everything crumbles fast and I want to share hits on enemies with them instead of one-shotting.  I might go into caution mode when the melees engage, but it hardly matters since everything aggros on them immediately and completely ignores my rifleman while I provide flanking fire.
---
My alt is a power armor/slugger build with a T-51b suit, a legendary sledge with blocking bonus effects and three ranks of Blocker perk.  Totally opposite.  I have a tesla coil mod on my torso piece and enemies will actually push my team-mates out of the way to get to me.  I just stand in the middle applying baby zaps to the whole mob and blocking as much as I can while my friends blast the hell out of the swarm.  When we do a run around Whitesprings they just post up on the bus or front awning of the Golf Club, let me run through the place grabbing all the aggro, drag them all into the parking lot, and it's an all-u-can-kill legendary fest while I block and occasionally smash a ghoul or two that starts gunning for someone else.  Everyone wins.
---
Old and nobody cares. Sorry bud
---
Don't worry I've now got a collection of useless one star legendary weapons - Guitar Sword signed by Marty Freidman, Two rolling pins from Mrs Beeton, Three Police Batons, four sets of one start legendary Mike Tyson Boxing Gloves, Six Charlie Chaplin endorsed Walking Cane, Seven Gordan Freeman Wrench's, Eight Captain Hooks, Nine Davy Jones Death Tambourines and a Partridge in a Pear Tree. Okay I exaggerate slightly the Partridge is now a 91st level Deathclaw…….. 
---
All you have to do is hit them once without VATS. Hit them once, then you can VATS. 
---
I like it. I agree we need a choice to set bull or per piece price. Also for they live of God let me key in amounts. That slider is so finicky. Let me just type an amount in.
---
Yeah, mate. Nobody plays it anymore. Ghost town.
---
I'm disgusted, but curious. Please go on! 
---
He heard about the butcher finally getting MEAT!!! and wanted to check it out
---
I spawn a full minute jog away. It's irritating...
---
Thank you.
---
I like this post. However, to most of the brain-dead, insecure tards who play video games, you're speaking an alien language. They must be the best. And when they aren't, it's your fault. 
---
Make mental notes of where you see certain items. A lot of times you will need something like plastic. The main areas will be farmed out but there are always alternatives. Instead of plates think about pool balls a cigarette cartons. Also in the beginning having a of on routine. I usually set my camp up down by the river and walk up the stream bed to Flatwoods. There are several great food sources as well as a lit of chem and first aid boxes to get my healing items to start up with. 
---
If you don't agree with him, cool that's your opinion, but wtf do you "doubt" what he said? I've been playing since the beta and I'm only level 160. 
---
I almost managed to down a level 200+ who murdered my Stash box for the bounty and was being a pest at Fasnacht, got them on their knees but couldn't kill them for some reason, then their mate came running with a Stimpak and that was the end of me xD.  Still had to try a few more times but no dice, haha.  For the most part, I find PvP amusing, even if the system is janky.  I might be terrible at it, but that doesn't mean I won't try!  And sometimes I just say HECK IT and go plunging into the fray with a switchblade.
---
For the daily biv quest 
---
New characters and level group filtered servers for survival
---
If you like to enjoy your bought weapons or lvl500 beta exp-farmed characters, stick to adventure(or rather get chained in there)
---
Especially paired with straight jacket or clown outfit bwahahahaha
---
And here I thought I was the only one deliberatetely making cluttered areas, nice to see a fellow horder :P
---
Makes it feel less like the Sims and more like a nuclear wasteland! 
---
What friends?
---
Oh okay 
---
This is very well done, I'm very impressed!

I hadn't actually noticed but I work long/odd hours plus I'm overseas so online time limited.

Its been in the game since day one the only hard thing is getting a tameable animal to spawn. The list goes as follows:
---
 Deathclaws
---
Megasloths (fuckers never spawn took me 2 weeks of sever hopping to get one.)
---
Mirelirks (kings, hunters, and normal ones but that's being tested.)
---
Yao guai
---
Brahmin
---
Mongrels
---
Cats
---
Attack dogs ( just as rare as a megasloth)
---
Beavers
---
Mole rats 
---
Radrats
---
Opposems
---
Chickens
---
Rabbits
---
Radstags
---
Also if your tameable spawn happens to be legendary it wont affect it. You'll be able to tame it but you'll look like a bad ass for doing so.
---
Honey beasts drop them. If you run the parade event 3 usually spawn. 
---
Find a group and ask to party up. As long as you get your hits in you get XP for what they kill. It will level you fast. My clan buddies and I often take newbies under our belt. We often have a crap ton of plans we know already and it's a big boost to lower level. And what's a crap gun to us might be gold for those starting off.
---
Still I'd like to know the real translations. At least for those two.. Can you help me out a bit?
---
Loot pool? 
---
Most likely your deathclaw died on the way to your camp. They have to walk all the way to your camp. My best guess it was either swarmed by super mutants or tried to fight a scorchbeast 
---
&gt;	UNACCEPTABLE 
---
I really wish people would stop misusing this word. Why not simply accept “rare” means “you may not get it”, instead of losing your mind calculating how much cat-assing you’re going to need to do to get it?
---
Oh sorry, I meant the loot pool of the events
---
Perfect! Thank you!
---
You people are actually insane. The number of blatantly obvious posts from losers pretending to be high level grandstanders to prove a socialist point is sickening. If it's that important to you, I hope they allow it. Just to see you come back here and tell us about how you're pulling your eyelashes out over it. You're sick. Get help. 
---
If somebody is roleplaying a Fallout raider then they should easily die to a vault dweller.
---
Yea this would make everything so much easier. 
---
If you go to a P2W site like G2G you'll see that items there are selling for $25. Accounts cost $15, and that's 8250 lbs of storage - about 412 handmade rifles worth about $10.3k in sales. I don't think the weight limitations are doing much to prevent dupers from hoarding and selling. If you check those prices elsewhere like U4GM or Aeoh you'll probably see them selling at higher prices - so this might be the modest estimate. 
---
Meanwhile, people who are trying to establish themselves as player vendors and be the NPC's that Bethesda said we are supposed to be can't fulfill that role much. Those people, the ones doing it for fun and social interaction instead of RMT profits, are the ones affected by the new encumbrance rules. To think of that change as a strike against dupers really ignores the profit margins they operate at and how little the change affects their overhead cost.
---
If they want to hinder dupers, it's better that they just monitor player actions and flag for suspension those who follow procedures to cause a dupe. All these other actions are just pithy feel good encouragement. Given there are still active exploits to dupe, if we bar entrance of old characters into survival we're not hindering the dupe economy. We're creating a new market where they can charge $45 instead of $25.
---
I know, i have all the perks and have used them repeatedly. My disagreement was with him saying you have to be double the level. Which isn't true. You just have to be higher level. 
---
IF players want to transfer their character they can but only one way, one time. Meaning they move it to Survival and can’t come back into Adventure with same character. 
---
The bad side of that is Bethesda will be allowing duped items into a clean world which frankly, let everyone start at the same level and work it in actual survival! 
---
It’s one thing to be a god PvP and making the playing field level from the start would be better overall for everyone. 
---
We have expierenced it resetting at about 4am CET (11pm ET). But that is kinda vague from us. We did not expierience it on the clock. 
---
He means it breaks immersion. It would essentially be canon that the game is a simulation 
---
You got xo1 mate cuz it makes it easier
---
is their a post showing the masks rearity or does anyone knows where i can find it?
---
asking for a freind LOL
---
I know you are talking about the railway rifle. This got me thinking though. What about a steam weapon. It would basically work like a flamer. Have it sound like a teapot when attacking. It could use wood and boiled water as fuel for the lulz.
---
I like this idea but I hunt all of them anyway. I just never really take their junk or go as far as to destroy their camp for a bounty. 
---
The thrill is in the chase, the kill is just a formality.
---
I am hearing what you are saying and i agree. But they said that this mode is Beta, so with our feedback i hope that will have soon a pvp mode as we want/need it :)
---
Gamedev was a lot easier when games left 98% of everything to the players’ imagination  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
---
You won't be using beds to heal. Beds are only good for small xp boost while being well rested, and decor for camps. 
---
What a nice idea. Maybe instead of activating the quests or deactivating the quests, let the colour change to red, green, blue and so on.  
---
There is always the option thou to deactivate other quests so you can see the one you are most interested in better.  
---
If they only used one location for voting then why not someone in the minority just nuke the voting area?
---
Good work with the survey but jesus, the event has been on only for couple days. You expect ultra rare to be ultra rare if you want to ask better drop rate? Just give it some time
---
You can also do the event irrational fear. You have to kill a bunch of honey beast. I believe butchers bounty actually helps with getting it 
---
Mostly level 1 armors so not as effective but occasionally there’s a furious or bloody something that can be useful when leveling up.
---
Taking screenshots on console is easy; getting them out, not so much. 
---
It may be lower lvs joining and hiding to get the exp. They cause her to get harder the more of them there are. 
---
Dude, we've datamined the game files. We k*now* it's bugged. If you can't fix it before the end of the week, fine, just don't lie about it.
---
Agreed. It shouldn't be too different games. It's one game two different modes. It's just a bigger pacifist toggle switch. I'm looking forward to this update as it was explained in Bethesda post. I'm sure there will be some snags but I'm sure they will be worked out.
---
I want the prepper stuff... so badly 
---
Right but due to the last change any overweight players only get the option to destroy items until they become back to regular weight. So no more players over the limit.
---
If they set a weight early on 90%+ of all these dupe issues (meaning quantity) wouldn’t have happened since players would have a limit. 
---
Farming plans should be a one time deal for known plans and not allow players to pick up ones they have or know. 
---
Those websites also sell caps and they have tons of low level characters selling everything at vendors to get caps including duped items. 
---
They’re still in business and still selling. 
---
Seems Bethesda should go and buy some and put them out of business altogether. 
---
Give. It. Time.
---
Hard lemonade. Even the basic lemonade helps but the hard version is way better and affected by Party Girl.
---
&gt; THEY DONT EXPECT YOU TO GRIND THE EVENT ALL WEEK
---
How the hell could they not expect people to grind it all week WHEN IT ONLY LASTS A SINGLE WEEK??????
---
Literally made a post on that yesterday...
---
This sub is ridiculous if it thinks game design decisions should fall to majority voting, whether on an online forum or in game.
---
Give feedback and suggestions, bug report, provide constructive criticism. Sure.
---
But this...
---
https://youtu.be/lhckuhUxcgA
---
all right I'll give it a try the next time  I am unfortunate enough to fall into combat.
---
Yes
---
Why would you think that every character should be able to craft everything? You can purchase stuff or just loot it if you don't have high enough Int.
---
hey man who you calling old fart 40 is the new 20, but im on xbox and a gamer 4 llife!!!!!!!!
---
xbox live SpoonierMonkey.
---
down to team up and have some fun......
---
I haven’t even gotten the beret 
---
yes, exactly my retire plan. i just need to get the wife onboard. lol 
---
I don't think it is. When. I ported in and started going at her it was 3 People. Same damage as with 15
---
I launched one the other day and it was the most pathetic thing I’ve ever seen. I’m no high level (only 63) and this was my second time doing this event. The first time was kick ass. There were people shooting and fighting the entire time.
---
People kept going down and getting revived. We all worked together and beat the queen within 15 minutes give or take. My weapons broke about 10 minutes in and I ran out of ammo for my guns. So I was just punching shit and reviving people. Doing what I could to contribute. It was one of my favorite gaming moments ever. 
---
Flash forward to my second queen event, a bunch of level 30-55’s show up. Some not even on power armor. Only 2-3 players over 100 and me. I had spent real life days making supplies to get ready for this. I relocated my camp to the ash region by a lead deposit to make ammo. I went in with over 5000 .50 cal rounds. And a fully upgraded all rise super sledge. Granted they’re not *great* weapons, but they do the job. These other players show up with laser pistols and Bowie knifes. Hunting rifles. Just trash. Straight trash. I was so dissapointed because I spent so long preparing. I burned through my ammo and my sledge broke. I was the only one able to kill anything. Terrible time. 
---
&gt;	to make us all farm the event for 7 days
---
Not “us all”. Only those who apparently *cannot literally continue living on this planet* without the rare mask. I did the event once, had a lot of fun, got an owl mask, moved on. 
---
I suspect soon. If you notice the GUI in the fermenter allows you to select an item. It doesn't do anything at this time but I suspect that's what it is for.
---
Let's talk about the egregious chant of "no npc's" when Bethesda said "no human npc's" Let's talk about, maybe they didn't run into Grahm? Maybe they turned a blind ear to the surly raider vendor bots or protectron workers worrying about losing their jobs to humans, but literally the second faction, the second chapter if you will, you run into Rose, as interactive as an npc that you'll find in any ONLINE game (I won't argue as interactive as any fallout npc) and I won't talk about any of the others abound. 
---
How many said it was boring, when nearly every location has a side mission or repeatable event if not two. How there are horde events and other randomized events, how it entails everything from hot dog eating contests to marking targets to call in artillery fire. How powering up a power plant will allow you to find areas you can link in and power your camp. 
---
How they complained about lagginess and optimization when a computer rendering objects has to render everything in the draw distance whether it's in plain sight or not. That means every polygonal bit of debris, every placed stimpac, gas canister, tin can, furnished interior, etc has to be rendered. How optimization would eliminate that. How a fallout with no wayward clutter, all with physics I might add, would not be fallout. 
---
How the meme of Bethesda games being buggy created a community that thrives on being the first to post videos of bugs and glitches gave the YouTube community a tribe of clips to use, compile and put out to make the game appear much worse. I'm not going to say those bugs are fake and I won't say my experience is indicative of everyone else's but watching reviews would lead you to believe the game is nothing but a horde of t-posing enemies. I've been playing since the beta and I've seen only one. I'll even tell you I have seen bugs that I havent seen reported on. 
---
On how a certain "reviewer" fixated on the admittedly poor splash animations but how that led me to realize how other games don't have them. 
---
On how that same reviewer cited another for him to justify not playing the game further, yet didn't stop him from putting out a review from his incomplete knowledge. How he then complains about his frustration about having to lug his junk, whether trudgenly encumbered or dropping most for a quicker journey, back to his camp to break it down. When simply playing the game one would realize workbenches to break down junk are abundant and Red Rockets and train stations allow you to access your stash so you don't have to go back. 
---
Or how about another reviewer using the previous reviewers footage. Granted he used it to show that he found the same issues but went I'm to use other's footage. How is a review based upon another's experience legitimate? This is when it stops being a review and is merely "entertainment"
---
And then let's talk about you, assuming you are who your profile name implies. 
---
You put out a video on the whole Bethesda releasing thousands of people's info when it was something like 63. I'm sure we know the story, you apologized, you made a video apologizing, nobody really expects a video about a good thing to be as popular as bad news. Reddit further criticizes reviewers, you reply and you make a video of your reply. 
---
But with an apology one expects a change in behavior, a good faith effort to avoid thw same mistake. But what happens? Soon after you make a video about Bethesda banning youtubers. Do you mention in the title that these were people who were publishing footage to glitches and exploits, of which doing them alone violates BGS terms, but in instructive and video form so others can replicate? Nope just a complete reversal back to the aforementioned egregious behavior. An apology without change isn't worth a thing
---
Of course we shouldn't have expected anything. In your so called apology you referred to the game as dumpster fire. At that point all cordial gestures were thrown out. One should at least know their audience and you displayed yours wasn't the Fallout 76 fan base. 
---
They already said they’re making balance changes to gun damage. Will y’all just give it shot before you start complaining? It’s a beta so a lot will probably change between now and the final survival mode. Submit your feedback directly to BGS and let the majority win, I personally think what you’re proposing is wanted by the minority of players but who knows. 
---
I find it hard to believe that duping is patched and if no one can bring their gear over then someone’s gonna dupe ass/sent gear in survival mode and sell it for a premium making it even more of an uneven playing field.
---
At the big train yard near the Scorchbeast Queen area I had every spawned enemy there a legendary eyebot.... I nearly died in game because I was laughing so hard in real life.
---
You ever watched the movie The Ring?
---
i have done it like 10 times already and it has been a balst. 
---
I had 3 honey beasts spawn at Middle Mountain Cabins the other night. I dont remember if they dropped honeycombs though.
---
Those should've just been obtainable plans from the BIV daily. I feel like Bethesda have just missed so many opportunities to do that little bit extra
---
That's waaaaaay overboard.
---
I hope they come out with private servers, and soon, that way you people who want to take the game to a Dark Souls level of masochistic difficulty can do whatever you want while the "rest of us" are still able to play.
---
Care to elaborate or you just into mic dropping without a punchline?
---
Not the level thing. The fact that he’s been on reddit for 2 years. That he has made multi post on this sub reddit but yet doesn’t know any meta or builds ? How are you over level 100 and not know what builds are yet. 
---
Read above comment to other person
---
we all lived it, its part of the grind off the game, could have been better divided to make it even but is not. boost lvls up. or find someone to team up with you. when I get a team request 99% off the time I will accept it and help you out. I actually enjoy going around helping low lvl players. 
---
I agree. We can build plasma weapons from old light bulbs and fans. Are you telling me I can't fix that damn door?
---
If I want a keyboard, I will buy a computer. I have a console, so I do not have a keyboard. Also, I do not have a keyboard, I don't use them, I have a laptop so the keyboard is integrated. 
---
Many of these type might switch to the new mode so. 
---
"I feel like Bethesda have just missed so many opportunities to do that little bit extra."
---
This is what jumps at me every minute of the game.
---
How about making some sense,I think that would be a good start.I don’t know what the hell you are trying to say.
---
There should be a sub menu called "Mixed drinks" when you go into the brewing station. I used hard lemonade. The recipes can be bought from a random encounter lemonade vendor, or people selling them.
---
....after seeing what it may look like in the trailer I do not desire to see a horde of zombie sheep apes thank you very much...
---
I speculate that it was simply because of the mass influx of players, even if having thousands of items on a mule caused lag it's not like anyone with them was playing on said characters at all times, as of now you can't do anything with said characters except delete everything. There is more than meets the eye here, you can only speculate but you don't know the full scope of things, and no one knows why players were rebanned as of now. 
---
Go to Dyer Chemical. Out back they spawn. It's random so you may have to server hop. They tend to spawn at night and after the heart of the swamp event.
---
We are fo76 players,we don’t have friends.
---
Excuse me but how is it overboarded if everyone starts at the same point, and with similar player skill groups only together?
---
I got no hate for the alternate opinions, I get where they're coming from, but I personally have no need to be on an even keel with everyone else.  I just play the way I play, and figure most others are doing the same.
---
&gt;If they set a weight early on 90%+ of all these dupe issues (meaning quantity) wouldn’t have happened since players would have a limit.
---
So they just buy another account and load 5 more characters under the encumbrance limit. They hold 10k worth of inventory and a new account costs $15. Even if this system was established early on, their overhead is essentially 0.0015% of their revenue. I would like a system that actually hinders them. This hasn't and if continued will not.
---
&gt;Those websites also sell caps and they have tons of low level characters selling everything at vendors to get caps including duped items.
---
They dupe nuka colas and make a macro to drink thousands of them. No need to involve a vendor.
---
&gt;Seems Bethesda should go and buy some and put them out of business altogether.
---
Bethesda's process of dealing with duping drives them to make more profit. If a RMT seller needs to buy more storage space (another account), that means bethesda is selling it to them. Everyone continues to benefit from this system except hobbyists that enjoy trading items for fun. 
---
Good old Planetside 76.
---
It’s going great,it’s almost like nothings changed.
---
This dude said "Like McDonald's and their Happy Meal Toys" your comment made my night. Thank You.
---
Umm.. What??
---
&gt;  Safes in Flooded Trainyard
---
Are these the 3 dotted around the area or is there a safe room like the one at the NAC Railyard NE of whitesprings?
---
Players have been giving input since it was announced. From what I have seen, more people are for making new toons rather than allowing existing toons to move over to the pvp servers, or even worse, go back and forth between the servers. People bitch and complain and argue on reddit, then maybe one or more of the devs read parts of the arguments and maybe have a quick run through the posts to see if more are for one way or the other and go that way. I vote enough for crap in my life, I don't need to vote for crap in a video game. Let the devs do what they want, if it doesn't work out, they can roll back or do something to change to make it better. FO76 is supposed to be an experiment so let them experiment. 
---
I've done it maybe 5-7 times. It's not even weekend yet and you guys farm some damn masks on low level event.
---
Nice, I'm slowly working my way towards the end game myself and looking foward to launching a nuke or two.
---
Did the glassed caverns part last night,  managed OK with a few stimpacks. I found getting there was harder due to being a melle build and there being three scorchbeasts outside that refused to land.
---
You should take advantage of this opportunity to be the only person who has a picture of their character posing in fear as a dead Brahmin gets flung at them.
---
Finally, a post I agree with. Idk, some people seem to gloss over the fact that this is an apocolyptic game. To each their own, but assuming that everybody is looking to do events and find legendaries seems presumptuous. Idk, my way of playing is to get in a good place economically, buy all of my stuff off of the market, and hunt wanted players. Alot of people on this sub complain ALOT about x y and z, and to me it's like; so basically you want infinite storage space, no one to be able to hurt you at all, and to get legendary drops for killing a Brahmin? Idk, I just see alot of complaints on this sub. Like, MOSTLY complaints framed as ideas. This mode seems cool to me, and they're doing it specifically BECAUSE all of the people were complaining about pvp. Why don't we wait to see what it's actually like before we start talking about all of the things wrong with it? Sorry, rant, I'm good.  
---
It's been fun. I have the owl mask, and while it's a super common drop I think it looks awesome and I love it. So...don't be fixated on the Rares, and have fun with what the game is?
---
$8 PayPal. If so send me your info.
---
He’s a filthy causal, it’s implied in the name. Some people just want to play the game and aren’t focused on PvP like the OP said. I guess you’re entitled to your doubt it’s just kinda stupid when you’re just speculating about their motives and understanding. 
---
You know some offer building services. Someone posted it on the marketplace and I know I offer the service in trades. 
---
Which ones are rare? I have tooth man witch and giant 
---
Sadistic... I like you 
---
Are you complaining that audio that is supposed to be muffled is too muffled? Just want to make sure before I call you stupid. 
---
I’m agreeing with you by the way, but it seems if they wanted to do something and track someone who drinks 1k in Nuka cola they could just as we’ve seen with them tracking exact amounts of other items. 
---
The data is there. 
---
Jester, goblin, sun, skull with hood, and old man winter
---
Its not that, its just a 1 in 3333 that you get one of the rare masks
---
I did this constantly on my main. And low level 3 star OP gear. Flux is incredibly abundant now. It makes everyone's life better if we are all super fast kangaroos. 
---
Meh... I just playing how i like it. My current build is all about max weigh lol. I use handmade rifle wtih double damage to max health enemies, reactive hammer from watoga quest and simple non-legendary tesla rifle.
---
And X-01 power armor.
---
So! Can you tell me please what the point for me to create new char? Do you even understand what in 1-2 weeks all survival server will be filled with TSE guys 100+ level? But not me or people like me. After 1-2 weeks we will be 40-60 lvl and have some shitty legendaries, because we don't **grind whitespring 8 hours per day**
---
And these never dropped they really screwed up
---
Wrong, I for one have the plans to make witch outfits and skeleton outfits, they sell for a lot of caps at vendors and that is why you always see them at vendors amongst other items, this is not because of people stockpiling massive amounts of them. 
---
You do know these daily quests aren't limited, right? You will get every single recipe in a few weeks or so
---
I'm glad something is super rare and only a very small slice of the game will have them this year. It makes them even more special for the lucky folks who do get one (and it's just that, luck!)
---
Same, I have to remember to wear my power armor before I log out but sometimes I forget or the server crashes. 
---
Not all  have so much time to start game with new character. Not all of us want to do it. Not all players have overpowered weapons or armors. 
---
So if we all will need to create new characters it give an advantage to hardcore players, not for casual. Because hrdcore player will get 50lvl and top weapons in few days, but casual players will get it a much slower
---
Hold my beer I’ve gotta run a parade with robots
---
Wut about that Reddit post about a pet scorched deathclaw? Also awesome info tyty.
---
Yeah but it's not quite the same😑
---
They should make it mandatory to start new character, its going to be really unfair for those dupers that didn't get banned since they will have all the legendary gears to keep them alive over others.
---
I understand the point of putting rare items into the game but to make them this rare on a timed one off event is pointless. The only people who are going to enjoy this content advertised to us all are those who cheat these objects into existence.
---
I seriously don't mind grinding for rare drops. But if the odds are that stacked against me then it's actually off-putting. 
---
Absolutely not
---
Why?
---
Idk why they'd be afraid, when I was new (still am a bit) I'd welcome anyone dropping by even if stupid high level. My junk is in chest and my house wouldn't be too hard to redrop to rebuild on the off chance someone is a dick. Only had that once, guy 10 levels lower kept attacking camp, so I kept executing him. Eventually his buddy comes, levels the camp with bombs, and chases me down. Oh well part of the game I guess lol
---
My problem with being able to switch modes with the same char isnt even pvp, it’s that survival will be pointless. 
---
Who cares if you drop meds when you die when you can just log into adventure and gather so many meds in 30 minutes that it lasts for the next 30 hours. 
---
There is no ”survival” mode, just free pvp mode.
---
Ps the whole dropping meds thing is stupid because meds are completely useless in value because they are so easy to obtain. 
---
And you dont even drop all your meds, just some of it so there is no risk.
---
Joining later is just the nature of the beast. However joining late when people that have been playing since the beginning have had access to the basically limitless amount of duped items. The people that want to hop back and forth fail to see that they just want to keep their god mode items to lay waste to those that didn't have easy access to them earlier in the game. Face it, you are power gamers and want every cheap advantage you can get. Just make a decision, go to the adventure and stay, or stay on the pve servers. Hopping back and forth does nobody any good. 
---
Dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. If I wanna play on added content with my old character let me. It’s ADDED content not BASE GAME. They should have just released it as base content if they are gonna make it so you have to have new characters. Really stupid mentality... go play runescape if you care more about “PVE” that game caters to you guys. (It’s literally went to shit now that pvp is shit btw) 
---
I'm shit at maths so this may be wrong.
---
There are 8 robots that can be selected.
---
Only five happen at each event.
---
This gives for a chance of over 32000 different combonations of robots. (eight to the power of five: this is where I think I fucked up, as my maths goes on them being in a specific order).
---
If it's eight to the power of three (the 3 robots left out of eight) it still gives over 500 combinations of parade choices. 
---
Its sad cause I feel like the beret and witch mask are rare drops, the 5 undroppable mask are nonexistant. When they said oh those mask dropped have they even tried playing the event few times? Lol are the 5 mask going = less then 20 people from consoles and pc having them?
---
I had a Death Claw but it died. 
---
Yeah, I have to admit to being really torn here. In principle the idea of rampant PvP isn't my thing, but in practice I really want some of those legendary weapons. My mouth is watering at the thought of having that "Medical Malpractice" handgun. I may just need to give it a go. I'm already imagining holing myself up with a bunch of supplies in the most remote corner of the world where no player would ever think to come looking for me and wait out the end of the world there! 
---
large-scale duping has been greatly diminished, so while im sure its possible that a dupe glitch still works it's being kept secret from the majority of players.
---
As for nerfing gun damage, a legendary weapon can do thousands of damage per hit with the right build, and sentinel's armor completely removes the need to have a balanced build because it provides so much damage mitigation. While the damage nerf is definitely a good thing because longer fights are more fun, ultimately the damage nerf would have to mitigate so much damage to balance legendaries that those without legendaries will still barely be able to compete, it would just be slightly better because you might not get one shot.
---
It's not the concept of legendaries being powerful that's the problem, it's the scale. I'm fine with losing a fight because the other guy did more damage than me, I'm not ok with being one shot before I even see the other person.
---
This is the only real solution. People will eventually get legendaries and one shot people unless they taken out in survival mode. u/thelonevaultwanderer u/ladydevann
---
So build on adventure then move to survival. Derp problem solved. Your theory makes your argument irrelevant because the player loss from adventure mode will make it easier to grind there.  If your theory is correct however, then Bethesda is still doing the right thing because the PLAYER BASE is rising.
---
Is the giant rare? First drop and everyone else got it as well in my game
---
It was a very lucky find. I'm now in the habit of checking what the vendors have now rather than selling and dashing. Fyi, check the misc tab too, I've got about 10 technical data off vendors and they're only a couple if caps. Just remember to het them one at a time.
---
Too bad we can never test this out because we can't kill the robots ourselves and with the horde of randoms they are going kill any threats that would kill a bot, I was able to do the event with 2 bots dead and I think I finally got the witch mask or some more dupe masks, so its hard to say if less bots = better odds.
---
Issue is, why would you play the game then? That removes the only thing from the game which is loot.
---
What is there to loot if there are no legendaries? High lvl players can already craft literally every single weapon and armor in the game.
---
Its insane Ive done nothing but this event since launch. Its pushing 50+ times ive done this thing and still nothing not even been in a match where anyone has had one. Ive been giving out full sets of the parade mask just because I have so many mask. 
---
So I just experienced the pink glow while in Power Armor tonight, despite not eating anything. Funny thing is that I crashed maybe half an hour before I even saw the pink glowing around me. My friend in my team pointed it out first, so I checked it out in third person view. It was cool and all, and there were no more NPCs/monsters in sight to see if they glowed to. My friend however did not have the glow effect. Maybe because he wasn't using Power Armor? I did notice that I had the "Detect Life" effect wheb I checked my Stats. I also don't recall having any sort of Targeting Hud mod on my Power Armor, which is what confuses me, since that seems to be what everyone has in common in this thread. I don't use the Excavator, but I am level 26. I have the basic Chassis, a Helmet, A leg, and.. maybe an arm or chest piece? I forget. But it's not even a complete power armor set. At least the Power Armor is something in common?
---
Yes please, for the love of God. Transfering characters makes no sense.
---
Duped gear is baseline. If you ever played an mmo in your life, you’d know they WILL role out BETTER gear. 
---
Long story short this thread if full of people who have never played an MMO in their lives, let alone get good at one. 
---
So whats the point of not getting any serums when you can just transfer them from adventure? Why disable something when people can then just use another gamemode to get it? Why bother
---
The point of survival is mainly pvp, so only being allowed to fight people around your level is pretty much worse for immersive pvp than adventure mode. Also, while you probably will lose a 2v1 regardless, it's still way more fun to be able to put up a fight than being one shot by even one other player who brought his god tier weapons over from adventure.
---
I still remember for the first few weeks of the game's release I got into a couple of really fun fights, because nobody did so much damage that we were one shot by a god weapon and nobody was invincible because they had legendary armor sets. Now, the people still willing to fight are mostly just unbeatable people with god tier items, and even if you have the equipment to challenge them the fights consist of jumping straight up and down for the sentinel's armor buff and one shot critting the enemy until he gets bored
---
Well I’m a crit sniper with chameleon armor so your character definitely won’t see where I’m shooting you from and I can easily one shot anyone even an Assasins sentinel build with a crit headshot. 
---
That’s what you don’t seem to understand, there are counters to a lot of these builds. It sounds to me like you want a server with no legendaries, I think that could be a good idea but you shouldn’t subject everyone to it, it should be optional. 
---
And it’s not just a nerf, watch the inside the vault and they talk about scaling up other guns damage aswell so I think it should be more balanced. If you find yourself in a fight with an ass/ sent build, run away and they can’t chase you without becoming very vulnerable. Ass/can build chasing you? Throw a cryo grenade and take out all their AP leaving them vulnerable to damage. Try out different scenarios with your friends and I think you’ll find there’s a lot of counters to these “meta” builds.
---
I'd be happy just to have the ability to hide them but I like your suggestion more.
---
LOL instead of Downvoting just be productive
---
That's removing a lot of depth from builds. I'd rather them just make legendaries only give slight advantages, like the way perks do (5% damage here or there), that way you can continue working on your build past level 50 but people dont get one shot constantly or face someone who takes only 5% damage.
---
Fashisnasishtash you say
---
The people complaining are people who don’t even multiplayer. If they did, they played club penguin. Literally incapable of thinking outside the box. 
---
At least they tried I suppose
---
I wish I saw them. I still need soldier mask, I keep getting owls. (PS4)
---
Then don’t go on the pvp server? I’m really not trying to be a dick but everyone on this subreddit are snowflakes. 
---
No matter what people are going to be a higher level than you. There’s nothing you can do about it. If you transfer builds or not. Like I don’t want to have to start all over like the amount of time I’ve put into my build. It would be stupid. They would loose a lot of player base if they did that 
---
It's dlc for people who cheat. Nobody who plays legitimately is ever going to be able to obtain even one of these "rare" masks. 
---
Yeah, there's no way someone let that impregnate them with that grammar, let alone stick around after. 
---
I think it would be relatively easy solution to implement.
---
I think this post sounds a lot like the other 20 posts from earlier today.
---
well this was suggested by dozens of people weeks ago so it’s pretty irrelevant already
---
Not to mention all the caps that came from them/it. 
---
&gt;I understand the point of putting rare items into the game but to make them this rare on a timed one off event is pointless. The only people who are going to enjoy this content advertised to us all are those who cheat these objects into existence.

---
Yes thats the point ! i don't care about grind , but its an seasonal event ... dont make sense put a super low rate in a cosmetic item in a event that leasts just 7 days
---
I haven't helped with a Queen in a while because the last 3 didn't manage to kill her even with like 10 players. Kinda don't want to waste the time or ammo.
---
I like how everyone pulls out grammar since I’m not using punctuation points and shit... it doesn’t rly fucking matter and if you actual would have read everything you would see that I am replying back to OP I don’t have to reply back to a bunch of snowflakes 
---
Also I’m going to impregnate them? Tf does that mean 
---
I've done it at least 10 times in the last two days. 
---
Like I don’t grind white springs every day I have a job like the rest of y’all. But I put time into my build. It took a while to get where I am right now and I don’t want to have to redo all of that fucking shit again 
---
Yeah it would be nice to be able to see server size, like the number of active players on a server, and also have under lvl 50 servers aswell. 
---
Personally I hope they introduce a couple different game modes, one where you can bring you character from survival mode and take it back to adventure no questions asked. But also one with no legendaries where it really comes down to skill. 
---
I’m pretty sure those mods can only be learned thru plans.
---
You can't kill any squirrels, the RNG Gods love squirrels. Get your guts from chickens only. 
---
it's 20h for me
---
I want them to be much stronger then deathclaws
---
It's a shame because it's a great event. I'd play all week if I had even a 1% chance of getting the death skull mask. 
---
Doesn't work, various people have posted with varying bots left, still common drops. 
---
&gt;  I’m willing to do a 35 cap fast travel to collect a 5 cap bounty. 
---
Hm. You may need a twelve step program, you're a bit too bloodthirsty there big guy.
---
I would have gone
---
Don't do workshops if you don't want to get PvP'd. It's sad, but that's the way it is now.
---
Its happening Tuesday as is,get over it.It will be at least 1 patch cycle before any changes,if any.period.
---
Never seen it.
---
Never saw the nuka lamp either.
---
I’m level 170, I get bored: 
---
Yeah, I agree. Fallout 76 is one of those games when you don't really like it from the start but after you get better it is almost impossible to stop playing. Currently level 120, doing stealth commando build and killing enemies easily (except for deathclaws and yao guais) with my powerful auto suppressed handmade. Although the game does have some downsides (like the disconnect server error and weird in-game glitches), it has still being a pleasure playing Fallout 76 and trading with other players (one player crafted me a whole bunch of handmade rifles \[including a Quad Handmade rifle - quadruple ammo capacity\] so that I can learn new mods and I gave him a Stalker's explosive pump action shotgun in return - this was after the nerf patch and I wasn't doing a shotgun build anyway). Also, it is very interesting to play Fallout 76 because whenever you wander the Appalachian Wasteland there are always new enemies waiting for you, you have to collect your own resources (junk) or you won't be able to craft anything; shortly saying, Fallout 76 is the now the perfect online first person game after the Wild Appalachia was released - everything is balanced in the game (thank you for nerfing two shot explosive weapons - they were a bit too OP) and there are no more weird glitches like scorched moving through the ground (before the second patch was released) or enemies standing in the t-pose (only place I know this happens is the Whitesprings - when this issue fixed, there will probs be no more weird in-game glitches). 
---
Thank you Bethesda for your sweat and blood put into Fallout 76. I really enjoy it!
---
From looking at the notes yesterday it looks like a character can move between both. I’d much prefer to have a survival only character that starts from new , that way it will start with a level playing field 
---
you cant have instigating and executioners.
---
Im not sure how to vote but i have ran 15 events and got two of the witch giant soldier four of the owls and a beret no toothy and no rares. Several with 5 bots alive and no masks
---
It’s clear what OP is saying. You’re a griefer or a child trying to start shit stfu and let the actual players have a conversation
---
Someone with a set of sentinel's armor (-75% damage) and lone wanderer (-20% damage) takes only 5% damage. Even if the enemy has 1 endurance and somehow no damage resistance (this will never happen in game), you would have to do upwards of 5000 damage to one shot them. Possible, but notice how you would need a legendary weapon with an OP effect as well to do that much? On top of that, assassin's armor mitigates damage even further, so if the other guy somehow manages to miss all of his shots (that would likely one shot you if you didn't also have got-tier armor) and you broke some of his armor, the damage resistance would keep going.
---
In our current situation it either becomes a "who shoots first" fight or a "who has better gear" fight, with really no dependence on skill. I don't know about you, but that's not fun. Attempting to outplay the enemy ultimately doesn't work, because you can't kill them if they have enough gear and they can always kill you if you don't have enough gear.
---
It could be closer to balanced if Bethesda adds some sort of level matching system for servers so you group higher level players in the same servers.
---
Banned!!
---
Something you guys may not have thought of,maybe this event will be recurring and they don’t want everyone running around in “rare” masks on the first go around.Stop being whiny bitches.
---
Something definitely needs to be done. Once you hit high levels your perks get so cluttered.
---
It’s really fun. I just killed so many low levels reaping is loot rn 👌🏻
---
The only issue with this is that ragdoll effects are local to your system, therefore it could land one spot on your screen and somewhere else on your friends.
---
&gt;Excuse me but how is it overboarded if everyone starts at the same point, and with similar player skill groups only together?
---
If you're obsessed with "everyone being equal", then you won't be happy two weeks after Survival comes out either, since enough people will have obtained all the uber-powerful TSEs and other fun equipment to be at the same level as if they would have been if we just let them transfer characters from Adventure to Survival in the first place.
---
What then? Do we "start over" every month or so just to make sure "everyone starts at the same point"?
---
Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas definitely have the creepiest looking ghouls, but Fallout 4 and 76 definitely have the best jump scare ones. I  jump out of my skin when I approach a t-posing ghoul with my suppressed handmade rifle at the whitesprings, thinking the other ghouls cannot hear me, and then a ghoul jumps at me from my back with the mad yelling.
---
Also I hate how the ghouls can stagger you from the back, making you stop and giving other ghouls a chance to take free shots on you.  
---
46
---
Well I know that’s how it’ll start I’m js since it’s a beta there’s room for other game modes to be introduced later. I’ve gotta say I don’t agree with you on that one and it seems Bethesda doesn’t aswell. 
---
Same here - Qkchknz on Xbox but usually find me doing solo runs (except doing the parade grind)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Probably will get a better response here
---
That might be one solution... Another one is having something like Adventure, Survival, and Survival+ where you can swap characters from Adventure to Survival, but not Survival+.
---
That would solve everyone's problems.
---
a few months ago i had this but literally every time i went to whitesprings there was like 3 legendary level 1 eyebots as long as i stayed in that server.
---
Xbox problem since about 4th patch, the only way I've managed to get standard volume from my television is by plugging in a pair of headphones to my controller. For some reason this works. Otherwise,  like the OP, the sound is muffled or low.
---
Looks at my own base..............      feels sad
---
Exploit? Crafting a certain item and then scrapping it while also having the scrapper perk will get the original materials back plus one extra material (no super duper).
---
Bug? Crafting 150+ items in quick succession (like 2-3 / second) will boot one from the server and roll back the character.
---
Wait, but isn’t that how games should work? The person who has more time to play, should be able to have better stuff than you, else what’s the point of playing for a longer time? I’m sorry that you have stuff to do In the real world, and that this limits your time to play the game, but we shouldn’t be ruining the game for everyone who wants to start a fresh new character because you’re going to fall behind the natural progression of the game.
---
Hopefully you figured it out, but if not the new event is in Helvetia. 
---
yeah pretty sure you have to buy them
---
Vats crits negate Assasins/sent effects so yeah.. like I said do some research and/or test it out with some buddies. If you’re on XB1 I’ll be happy to show you how to defeat my build. 
---
Stop getting mad at people getting mad. It’s just as bad.
---
That is brilliant. XD
---
I was thinking maybe next you could trap players in a building with flamethrowers, sirens and a deathclaw inside while you fling brahmin at them.
---
Yeah thoses short are thight...

Thank you.

I do agree
---
I’m not mad,just providing a different viewpoint then what’s commonly heard.
---
Yeah I mean you can find them in the world and sometimes you get them from events, but vendors definitely sell some of them aswell.
---
I went to a nuke site today and there was around 15 others, but I got disconnected right before the queen was taken down. Haven't had a disconnect happen in quite along time, It was right after the Fasnacht so maybe that had something to do with it.
---
If able to transfer characters, the survival mode will be ruined right off the bat and the only the seasoned PVPers will go there.
---
This made me cry with laughter
---
I'm all for high value rare items the only thing is. It will be so rare nothing will be compairable for a trade and the very low currency cap of 25K isn't really helping mutch.

HOW DO YOU MANA.. Wait wrong game
---
Happened to me twice today, and also seen a player running around with no head!
---
Trust me a good unarmed build that can stagger me is really tough to beat, you’ve just gotta be creative with your methods imo
---
See how rare the beret and witch mask are that is what rare items should be in an event not this 00000000000000000.1% bs were the mask might as well be a unicorn among the horses.
---
Something about "slap damage" sounded so kinky.
---
I got a one star handmade from fasnacht.
---
With many duping exploits removed and all the TSE and god-teir equipment removed right away...  You cannot honestly believe everyone will have that stuff in two weeks? hardly.  If betheda has patched all methods of duping, you will \*not\* see that stuff for months.   Even then you will only have a few lucky people have those, not 90% of the community.   Survival population will be very competitive.
---
If someone has more time that others to play, then so be it.  That's how life is.   I do not play PVP because I am not good at it nor have desire to play it.  I have family and play very casually.  I know survival mode wont be good for me.    
---
The mole men have the materials you need for the armor quest
---
Too much text, no way i would read that, but if you care if you can overheal damage in pvp with stimpacks, no. Even weak weapon kills you in 3 hits.
---
Yeah that's just brilliant, let's wait a year to do the exact same event with the exact same rewards because they were too stupid or incompetent to set a reasonable drop rate in the first place. I'll be looking forward to that with bated breath.
---
He's all green in the trees in front of church most of the time.
---
One time he spawned in our back, lol.
---
Bethesda won't add this themselves, but the community fixed it:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
One functionality broke, you can't save loadouts anymore, instead, you have to create them via a third-party website ... but it's better than nothing
---
All though I see your point in most of what you say. Survival mode is gunna be geared entirely for players looking for a harsher gameplay. It isn’t designed for casual drop-in like how the base game is. If you’re worried about being griefed, survival is gunna be geared towards griefing and killing and you can bet Train Stations are gunna be direct spawn zones which means indirectly gunna be areas of interest for player killers. Short on time? You’re gunna be walking a lot since fast travel is limited to trains and camps. That “fresh start” is gunna be a massive game changer; FO76 had several massive updates to prevent future duping but the damage is already done in the current mode. Some dupers have copies of 100,000 Nuka Colas just to drink and earn that one cap. Luckily being primary PvE the damage to game is mostly unnoticeable.
---
So you are mad you can’t spam stims and 1 shot with your bloodied build anymore?
---
Solution,time to “git Gud” instead of letting broken mechanics make you feel potent.
---
Cry more.
---
LOL.  I always added it to my FO4 install.  Made me always want to seek shelter when the storms hit.    You would die if you stood out there too long.  
---
Added some excitement to the game.  The normal buildings did not work, you had to "zone" inside.  That was the only downside of it.
---
Yup, unfortunately, there are some mods that can only be learned from Plans and not scrapped from armor pieces.
---
The legendary effects aren't flat percentage decreases, they modify the initial damage which then goes through the DR calculation. Crits don't "negate" damage reduction effects, they just do enough damage to cut through DR. 
---
In other words, my point still stands. you need a very high damage weapon, especially with anti-armor to even stand a chance against someone with got-tier armor sets. I know crits are powerful, and that's another issue that contributes to the issue of either having one-shot battles or doing no damage. 
---
I'm not saying that these builds are unbeatable, I'm saying they're too powerful for most players to have a decent experience playing against them.
---
Who said anything about a year? Do you honestly think these guys aren’t gonna recycle content sooner than that?...just lol.
---
Sorry, this was glitched and revealed months ago.
---
Can you find the actual plans though? Or is it just the mods
---
Half of reddit will just say "REMOVE GAME FALLOUT 76 BAD"
---
I'll test that
---
I was talking about the OP you dumb shit. But now look how dumb you made yourself look. Hilarious. 
---
It's a real annual event that occurs in march you fucking moron.
---
That actually would be a fantastic in-game feature! 
---
Quest like this are AWFUL game design. The key and the paint job should be client side not server, forcing playing that want it to server hop is bad. There should never be anything that requires you to server hop.
---
I had no idea that subreddit existed, thanks for the heads up!
---
No problem! Enjoy.
---
Well obviously Bethesda has decided this is the way it’s going to be at least for the Beta. I highly doubt they change it after that aswell. I would be down for a separate server where there are no legendaries as I think it’s the only way to reach the outcome you desire.
---
I still think you’re giving those builds too much credence. There are counters and if you’re just running around spraying and praying you’re gonna lose to almost anybody regardless of their build. Employ things like gamma guns and orbital strikes on ass/sent players and light them up when they move. Just play smarter and I think you’ll find PvP to be rewarding. 
---
I need a Fasnacht donut!!! Omg.
---
Chance of getting any mask reward decreases if robots die during the event.
---
Yeah you can find the plans, I just got ultra light combat arm plans from an event in the cranberry bog, I find ultra light plans for other armor a lot in harpers ferry and by the black water mine. If you’re on XB1 I can show you the spawns sometime.
---
And extremely useless at high level.
---
I already said why.

This isn’t real life dumbass,it occurs when they turn it on.I realize it’s based on a real event,but this is Bethesda we are talking about.
---
Oh bro. You need help. I. Fucking. Love. It. 
---
Players aren't able to put aside bias, personal preference or use critical thinking long enough to be relied upon to make decisions about things like game balance and such. 
---
Cosmetic themes? Sure. Event types? Ok. Those are more opinion/taste based, and if you can give players things like that, things they enjoy but have no impact on mechanics or balance? That's great. 
---
There isn’t a paint job yet that covers the ultracite armour - at least, to my knowledge. I’ve heard some buzz about a leaked paint that’s possibly going to be released soon, but what you saw on the picture in the Atomic Shop was the T-51. As far as I can tell, they’re literally the same model, just with different names and different allowances for paint / mods. 
---
Lets be actually real. I don't need my current gear to dominate in PvP. I spent hundreds of hours testing various builds with my friends. I can reproduce around 60% of full assassin/sentinel set defensive capabilities with a crafted power armor build, lol, and I'd be wearing that on day 2. I know which weapons and what build choices will let me shred through people even if the weapon is 1*.
---
The truth is that a lot of people know little and assume that everybody around is a griefer. The truth is also that if you haven't spent hundreds of hours testing PvP then you are by default wrong when it comes to survival.
---
The truth is if they start fresh, the majority will be facerolled. The truth is that anybody who says people who oppose the uneducated, stupid and false idea of fresh start leveling the field are "lamers who want it easy" knows little about PvP and are so wrong that they are incapable of understanding their error.
---
Players have trash insights on things like balance, so their opinions on decisions about issues like existing toons vs new characters is not welcome. 
---
Such a huge shame they are letting people transfer their characters between modes because this mode sounds awesome.
---
The problem is that it is now pointless. What's the point in having survival mode if you can just transfer back to adventure mode? It's basically deathmatch mode because nobody with half a brain will quest in this mode. It will be used purely for trolling and fighting.
---
You could have given players the option to permanently transfer a character from adventure mode with either no gear or just the weapons and armour they have equipped. Even that would have been 10x better.
---
oooh BGS... You were really close here to having something cool! I thought we were going to get a genuine survival 
---
I'm going to be so disappointed if they don't call it power armor... 
---
So Fallout 76 isn't an RPG but a pure Survival game? K, thx, bye.
---
Christmas events in June and Halloween every other month
---
That's .... twisted.   Well done!
---
I think you can tell we were all on board until you mention some weird communist shit.
---
All gear should be static in survival (No level, same stats across all weapons and armor)
---
This is a PVP mode, this is not the place for a Destiny loot and shoot.
---
It doesn't really matter if everybody has to start a new character. People who have lots of time will be leveled up in no time. And before you know it there will be level 200s running around again.
---
Yep lol
---
Quick chick as I used to have large Motorcycles (R1 / Hayabusa / ZX10) and now got to behave as I’m now a Motorcycle Instructor...
---
Damn... Thanks for Clarifying for me
---
Good stuff. I’m excited because this might stop my Brahmin being brutally murdered all the time. 
---
Do you have a background in game theory?
---
Do you have experience creating competitive game systems? 
---
If not, your opinion is worth approximately a bag of marzipan dildos. 
---
I think I'm sick of seeing this suggestion on here
---
Wait then why does everyone still go for the same corpse when looting?
---
Someone should also suggest to them to make it a playable instrument and to "nuka" the dummy part of the model.
---
Chill.

---
Sell/Trade them. I need a few now that I'm going to have to level up numerous times to sort my build out. Being able to sell/trade then would allow perk points to be used more wisely.
---
So a level 87 would start with all his quests and progress and somehow farm level appropriate equipment? 
---
Yeah. That's not gonna work. 
---
Probably having to leave and get food and water
---
I don't just run around "spraying and praying", I win when I get the crit headshot off first and they win when they do. That's how pvp in this game works. Trying to run around throwing grenades and waiting for them to move is just asking to be crit in the head. I don't pvp often, not because I'm "not playing smart enough", but because I don't think it's fun. I would love if pvp was like how you describe, but it's just not in practice, because of how powerful legendaries are on top of how powerful crits are.
---
Ye
---
No one is 
---
God I loved playing/DM'ing low magic gritty campaigns. 
---
Really doubt they would let us destroy perk cards for currency. Pretty sure duplicate perk cards will have something to do with being able to "prestige" that they mentioned in the road map.
---
Rare masks are ... rare.
---
Everyone on the server are not supposed to have them.
---
I am a part of this group, they're really awesome folks.
---
I have no problem with Bethesda making events with super super rare items. 
---
Over time, they help to create a healthy cosmetic trading market. 
---
Can you write sentences full or words that mean things right,
---
Wasn't it already confirmed? 
---
Kind of reminds me of the [Hacksmith](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbncXbXlaNQePXgW0zYsxT8-wK0cQfS3n)  exo suit build.
---
ironic
---
 The decision to allow characters to transfer between modes is so short sighted. To please a handful of players who didn't want to start fresh they have put so called 'survival mode' at risk of been dead before it even gains traction. Nobodies characters are bound so nobody will feel committed. Both modes are essentially the same game except one you can get rekt over and over in.... Now which mode are you going to farm / quest in?
---
The only reason you would go into survival mode is for the purpose of deathmatch. They could have literally just made a deathmatch mode instead. Why is everything that this company does half baked or trying to accommodate everybody and by doing so defeating the purpose of what they set out to do.
---
Most duped weapon was the TSE pump.
---
In your opinion? 
---
Are you a game dev or game designer? Do you actually have anything remotely relevant that actually quantifies “your opinion”
---
If it’s there game, there rules. 
---
And at the end of the day they have a lot more to lose then you do
---
I'm sorry, I was only trying to help out either Old and New players...
---
That and the fact once you get high on the leaderboards people can see your location on the map

There’s a broken sewer pipe that you can walk through to get inside

Plans are my favourite things to give to people. Especially new players when they run back to camp and build it in their excitement.
---
I had a level 12 build a dozen or so toilets after I gave him the plan, including a dining table with toilets for chairs.
---
You probably met me in WS. I have this one and the other one too.
---
I have better solution- all duplicated perk cards should be converted into respec points
---
For/fo76bazaar
---
Bro I paid 300 caps for one from the enclave bunkers that’s insane 
---
I dont have a bloody build, but last I checked mine can mine can 1 shot an ass/sent bloody build rather easily, the only thing that could save them is a serendipity proc. I guess when I said "highest damage builds" your brain went there but honestly that is just because of their popularity and because you obviously like to complain about them. 
---
I dont think having to map a bunch of aid items to keys or the wheel thing makes a player good or warrants you saying GG. Making it so you can't spam stims is just going to make people move onto using other things like blood packs, dog food, and nuka cola with their respective perks. Last I checked eating and drinking has no animation so how is that any better than stims that have an animation? People are already going to be popping cola like crazy just to get the ap the healing is just a side perk. All this is going to do is add to the items people that are already rich in caps are going to buy on the market to get back to combat faster while everyone else has to farm to prepare for survival sessions. 
---
Some people are getting offered irl money. Apparently one of the people who go the Old Man Winter mask was offered $50
---
Hey not a problem oc! Glad to help you out! It you need something else let me know!
---
I can't tell if you are arguing or agreeing that changing stims is stupid. 
---
Lovely, nicely done.
---
yeah and you'll get none of the cool new shit that only survival drops.
---
👍
---
I’m just sorry that you found out after buying the paint. I’m on PS4 and I’ve unlocked a couple of mods for the ultracite armour, if you’re interested in having your suit modded hit me up. 
---
I have an instigating Super sledge 1* [PS4]
---
Can i have that back...please? 
---
MIRV plan still available?
---
Played a bit yesterday till I left the vault and killed some robots outside. Graphics on ultra and field of view to 90 my cpu  and gpu  just hold out fine. And it looks way better then ps4 and better fps so  this far I'm glad I switched.
---
I mean, you can always craft stuff in the beginning cant you? 
---
Bethesda enables polling booth
---
Fallout fanbase: "WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THE EU!"
---
i definitely would be
---
Uhm.. i dont agree. people wont be playing this mode if they leave their main behind. its that easy.
---
Absolutely! Same goes for you, pal!
---
Hope this is the right peron lol, couldn't sleep so I'm on my phone,  checked reddit out of boredom 
---
What outfits are those? I'm not familiar with them.
---
The ops suggestions are really good ones!
---
Yeah, hoard's pretty messed up right now.
---
I walked just out of town and then back in and he was a corpse on the ground.
---
'Not everyone' and 'no one' aren't the same though.
---
I have been farming for ages and haven't got anything except for Initiate. 
---
Did 6 in a row the other night and got Stimpaks and 40mm grenades 😭
---
Anyone got any plans for sale? 
---
They will absolutely be able to be destroyed in survival?
---
What would the point of "staying alive the longest" be when you could just stand in your invincible camp. 
---
The one with the 90% weight reduction third roll?
---
I found this thread while searching to see if they worked this way, and then bought them anyway.  And they do stack now.  So maybe it's fixed?
---
You shoot the camp and the camp gets destroyed. Just like before.
---
They did say that whatever happens in one, transfers to the other. I agree with your wishful thinking but I don’t think you are right.
---
A few perk card combined iodinized meat and beer and you're set for over 24hrs+ irl.
---
Use some stealthboys, crouch so it’s harder to get vats critted, trust me orbital strike get people moving doesn’t matter what build they are lol. I’m telling you once I get staggered my ass/sent gear is worthless so maybe switch to shotgun or melee or heavy guns if you’re having trouble staggering these builds. 
---
I’m sure you play smart but if you don’t PvP a lot you’re not gonna know all the best ways to counter these builds. Could they use some rebalancing? Maybe, but you could say that about this whole game so no matter where you start there will always be an OP meta.
---
Gonna have to disagree for the simple fact I'm thinking about the game for the long run. All the problems you just listed would literally be a problem for any new players that come to the game when survival has been here for let's say a few months. 
---
Players will have been grinding survival mode and they'll be very powerful, as for the newcomers they would be discouraged to play because they'll just get destroyed by pvp veterans. I believe it's a good idea you can switch characters for each server. 
---
(We'll eventually be getting one shotted in survival mode after awhile because players will get stronger anyway.)
---
This this this.  There have been so many times when my gun went red and I was like "WTF? Ohhhh, I have weapon artisan on..."
---
Preach it! Me and my buddy save up our known plans and find new characters to give them to. If we have a lot of food or aid or even ammo we’ll throw those in too. I’ve found that the newer players generally rely on a ton of .308 and 10mm so I usually end up pretty low on those two. It’s a really nice feeling. 
---
Just weird that they are talking about progression and not mentioning a word about gear.
---
Just seems like the perfect compromise, people don't have to start from scratch but don't get to take the op gear from adventure to survival on day one
---
It’s Survival BETA. It’s gonna come out, and it’s gonna be a process. That what a beta is.
---
Ya then its just a matter of also clipping in. If you clip into a place like the presidencial sweet people will only know you're at the enclave bunker.
---
Is it possible to launch yourself? Is there a video on how to make this? I wanna make a launch pad!
---
I am suggesting that i will fix OPs child by kicking it in head (only if it wasn't even born yet).
---
HOW CAN YOU FIX SOMETHING THAT IS NOT MADE YET???? Oh my fucking god, people nowadays are so sensitive and stupid.
---
If you’re forced to do it so often you should have it down to a science by now. Perk load outs take only a few seconds to swap and equip. I don’t like the idea of someone swapping out all their shotgun perks to melee perks in one button press as the duck behind a corner. 
---
Probably because it goes without saying. Why didn’t they mention that your CAMP transfers over too? Probably because that goes without saying too.
---
Source?
---
The reason is because people were abusing the system. Maybe people who knew exactly where the boxes were. Maybe someone like you!
---
Completely agree.
---
I agree with OP 
---
I dont understand i thought there was only one mode and that it is survival? More info thanks
---
You and me both. x-x
---
Thats a pretty dumb idea to be honest. High level quests but no appropriate gear? Yeah no...
---
I get it, we have been through a lot over the last 4 months with this game. I love it too. If you want to rage, you rage brother. Who I am to tell you not to.
---
that and the 15% faster reload speed
---
Thank you for this post, exactly what i was thinking.
---
I really wish we could steal from other players' stash. Makes finding enemy camps rewarding!
---
How.
---
My thoughts exactly. The fresh player period would only last a week anyway to what is the point.
---
If you take a look at the relevant thread, opinions are pretty split on the matter, so it’s not like Bethesda are going against community consensus. 
---
It's a 2* legendary
---
I agree too many people are speculating and are too quick to jump on the hate train. I’m interested to see how the PvP damage rework plays out. 
---
You can craft? You dont need a tse to do quests. 
---
instead of this being idea being voting what should and should not be int the game, it could be a system for developers to know what to prioritize. they have a road map, and with what has been planed, players can vote what should be the priority of an update. does the player-base think there to many game breaking bugs and glitches.
---
it could also be a system to report bugs and glitches, with the voting booths being location markers for where the bug/glitch happened.
---
I don’t really mind. But I think it’s more so they can sell the “rare” ones in the shop 
---
I only claim them to get plans; I usually don’t bother even doing the “defend” events. 
---
I want it noooooooooow!
---
I think cross platform has to be built into the game engine from the start. So I don’t think they could add it if they wanted to. 
---
Maybe you’re supposed to nuke the event for a rare to drop. 
---
Duuuumb
---
I killed over 100ppl before. Only thing you need to have be prepared for is Sentinel/cavalier. Everything else is killable, even with non-legendary hunting rifle. Guys with TSE may oneshot you, but you can oneshot them too from sneak. And if they wont see you on map, where is the problem?
---
Some guys that was killed once and are now "PVP IS BAD" are stupid, but ok, think what you want. I would just like if they stoped making trilions of post how to fix something, that is not even out.
---
That's interesting. Warframe has it's daily reset at the same time.
---
I'm conflicted between thinking a fresh start would be pretty fun and giving up the shit I spent like 300 hours grinding for on launch, but I also have to look at this long term. If this broken shit exists in the game, then it will continue to exist. Fresh start will make survival good for what, a month at most? Permanently splitting the servers will only cause problems for a dwindling playerbase.
---
I really enjoyed radstorms in FO4, but that was because I wasn't insanely limited by resources and HAD to eat and drink. To me, FO76 doesn't seem like a Fallout game exactly but I like it even without NPCs. It has an interesting feel and the missions aren't too shabby at all. 
---
The point is that majority of the people are fair and want the game to be what in their minds will be fair. The truth is that this game systems are so complicated and so often unreliable that this understanding of fairness is as often wrong. It doesn't mean they are bad of stupid people. Its just their suggestion being irrelevant because they haven't spent enough hours to pass the Mass Effect trilogy simply testing weapons on their F76 friends, which is not something you can expect from people.
---
This exactly! People are looking for simple fixes that are only short term - I guess that’s the issue with the world today.
---
Cuz they’re all like 14-17 or maybe older but total nerd shut ins? I know a few people that would be the type to slam a game endlessly online. Not the kind of people anyone listens to irl
---
I use an ultracite Gatling laser and it melts every melee  build that comes for me because they get stuck in a stun lock and just try jumping around. I’m worried about those stealthy bois who shoot me in the back while I’m tea bagging a dirty unarmed user. War, war never changes. 
---
How much time we talking when shits still broken from at least the launch patch??
---
I agree. Always find something to complain about. Spoiled kids... 
---
Sure.. do you know the repair costs of a decontamination shower?  It uses flux.  Those are not the easiest things in the game to get.
---
I just nuked Helvetia with a friend while fashnact was going on.
---
At that point, I would consider building a huge tall red wall right on edge of my property facing his.
---
Put some spotlights on the wall just to light up his beautiful area.
---
While they might not be "literally invincible", the point stands that they might as well be to anyone who isn't already part of the meta. I've rarely seen PVP as unfriendly to outsiders as FO76's is.

Since characters can flip from one mode to the other you can easely farm 100+ beer and iodinized meat over the weekend and neither go bad
---
Also be aware that Bethesda knows about the Whitesprings camps and was considering placing no-camp zones there.
---
I read the notes Beth put out, honestly it looks good. 
---
People think their ideas are so great- 99.99% are terrible or completely unfeasible. 
---
For me is game smoth on PS4 original. If you thing any game this big and complex can be bugfree, i am sorry, but that is not real.
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about, we have tons of new content but because something is almost unobtainable and you can only rely on luck (not the trait but rng) everyone's complaining...
---
Or pick the lock.  They said you cannot "damage" the camp. Does not mean you will not be able to pick locks.
---
I'm on xbox otherwise I would. I just wish Bethesda wasnt so secretive on mods
---
well maybe getting kicked from the server on a regular basis and then there are the game freezes ( on a regular basis ).
---
And every new patch creates new different bugs etc that were not a problem before. Everything is unpredictable into the future. The game runs OK for awhile then turns to shit at the next patch. That is not to say the game is unenjoyable at times but it is an ongoing bug fest.
---
I am just happy the most annoying players will play Survival and the normal mode will become less frustrating. 
---
Compromise :
---
You can transfert but you can only play with people who transfered (group A).
---
If you create a new character in Survival then you will be only with people who created new character for Survival (in group S).
---
If you want to transfert your new survival character to adventure then he will move definitively from group S to group A.
---
Vote for me at next presidential elections.
---
Log out and log back, presto, not screwed buddy.
---
There are always ways around it.  Blow up the genny is such a way.
---
Don't tell Trump.
---
how fair is that we have known about this forever and players like enjoy pvp and have been working on gathering and getting gear towards pvp and now i possibly need to start from 0. on top off that after a few days off the server been release the lvl diffences would be great. for example im well aware that I can not keep up with someone that has i dont know the hole that to play like the 900 hour dude. I do have a life out side from the game. 
---
it is all part off the game, but I do understand were you coming from specially after the hole doping and ppl been able to get on the dev room. 
---
I will paiently waiting to see how everythiing plays out. 
---
They need to just turn the area PVP once you enter. Period.  Thats it.  You get notice you are entering PVP area.
---
Everyone
---
emplying everyone has a craft build. mfw i'd have to start with piperifle
---
So again I'd get spawn killed by dudes that can craft 1k damage gauss rifles
---
\&gt;balanced
---
Not angry. None of the masks are better then the Halloween skull mask anyway imho. I'm disappointed and confused in the way the event was presented tho. 
---
At the rate these masks are dropping, I'll never  see another another player with one, Nevermind own one myself. No-one will.
---
I'd play all week for a realistic chance at the rare masks but if I'm more likely to be struck by lightning then why bother.
---
You find it “despicable”... lol shut the hell up, nerd. 
---
Play adventure for a while to get plans for a good gun and armor?
---
You can buy almost every plan from vendors in the game.
---
Cause no-lifers have to have everything in the game or they whine about it 
---
Oh feck
---
GG...We need Kratos to take down all the Gods in FO76!
---
Which one do you own ?
---
What? Its not possible to loot anything but junk from person.  Also the drops on corpses are instanced.  They cannot loot "your" drops.
---
Don’t think they are that common 
---
I have strong suspicion you are one of these players who actually could shoot me down.
---
it wont change a thing, after a few days the lvl differences will be too great and you will get killed the same way with op characters from adventure or not, I know for a fact that I wont be able to keep up with ppl that have the hole day to play, not to mention that we knew this was coming and im possitive that are ppl like me that have been gathering and getting ready for pvp. lets see how everything plays out. 
---
It is a new start and a second chance at a first impression because it is a new game mode. A good number of players have been holding on and progressing with hopes of the future. This event is neat, I dont think people expected much from it, but the drop chance on a few of the hats is insane and based on the forums it put a lot of people in a bad mood. Getting a second black eye soon after the the last might cause even more people to leave and that is the last thing anyone wants.  
---
The old players from the dupe glitch era will certainly have them, but I don't know how many.
---
The solution is gonna be nerfing the sets by bethesda. Easiest way out for them and no need to balance anything. Sucks cause sentinel nerf is gonna affect us that dont give a rats ass about pvp
---
I enjoy the game a lot and I get angry when I see people talking crap about it on YouTube and everywhere else but then I remind myself that it’s probably for the best that Bethesda gets all this hate so they don’t release an unfinished game again. Or else we just encourage them to do it again
---
I'd love that lol
---
One-shot will be all it takes. I suppose people will go for chameleon legendary to be VATS-proof.
---
Well no, that's why I suggested the level matching. You said in another comment how after 2 weeks people will have TSE weapons even if they can't transfer their character, so adding a survival+ sort of deal just transfers the problem.
---
&gt; You’d also want us to allow fully kitted builds that utilize duped items to enter into this space, because of your reason. 
---
...And in two weeks you'll have people with "fully kitted builds" anyhow. The duping issue's been dealt with, nobody is going around with 10,000 50 cal TSEs any more.
---
At best, a "reset" is a band-aid fix to a problem that doesn't exist, which forces the rest of us to start all over again. No thanks.
---
Nope. Another reason I won’t be playing Survival mode. 
---
I've done it that often now that it's pure muscle memory, I don't even have to think about it. Still a drag though. My issue is once I've maxed a perk, I need the lower versions too.
---
People are angry because these are items people want. Being "just cosmetic" is irrelevant. I could say the same for weapons. There are other weapons, after all. You want the rare, cool looking one that matches your aesthetic perfectly? Just a weapon. Want the armour that would finish your set perfectly? Just some armour.
---
It's a videogame, none of this has real world value, being cosmetic doesn't inherently make an item less worthy of desire.
---
These masks were advertised, we knew they'd be rare, but a 0.03% chance of acquiring one in a drop is unbelievably unfair, genuinely ridiculous. You saw the math in the post you linked to. There's rare and too rare, this is too rare and, in my opinion, is worth being angry at.
---
I'm not particularly angry. I don't like any of the common masks enough to keep them (other than Soldier, which looks nice with my Enclave Officer uniform), and a Jester Mask would be PERFECT for my regular outfit. So I'm a little annoyed, rather insulted, feeling a bit betrayed, ripped off.
---
But the anger is understandable.
---
Like everyone else I have them all except the rare ones. 
---
Don't act like you had to look it up, didn't know what it means, or that you found its usage in my sentence worthless or obnoxious as to rouse moral indignation. 
---
just put your junk and meds in yours stash!
---
There’s counters to everything, it might not be obvious but no life’s know 
---
That fix would work :o 
---
Being naked with chameleon mutation will be meta change my mind...
---
Dude. The survival mode will be in addition to the current one. The pvp guys will go there. I hope. You and me stay here and live in peace. Yay?
---
No if you are going to have a pvp specific mode then all players using that need to build their accounts under that pvp mode.
---
It is why Ark separates pve from pvp servers. Why Runescape didn't allow character transfers to Old School Runescape. 
---
Didn’t say the game wasn’t “smoth”, I said shit is still broken since at least launch. When Bethesda can’t get a simple fucking texture on an ATOM STORE ITEM right how long is long enough?
---
&gt;You cannot honestly believe everyone will have that stuff in two weeks?
---
I absolutely do. There's people out there who farm things on MMOs for a *living* for crying out loud, out of hundreds of thousands of players you really think none of them will find ways to rack up experience and equipment in two weeks?
---
I’m tempted to as I’m pretty heavily melee focused for pve and I never worried much about pvp. I started again tonight and... we’ll it might just be better to spend ten or 20 levels moving specials and perks around. Starting over after 100 fells pretty rough. 
---
I remember this was a thing from awhile back Whitesprings had all clubhouse spawns replaced with lvl 1 legendary eyebots. Thanks for confirming it was real and I'm not crazy!
---
Any build is overpowered tho? 
---
Once you enter combat with someone sneaking, vats work in him anyway. (If you are not in event)
---
I don’t care about junk and meds, I’m not interested in a PvP system where survival depends on how much money you spent on eBay, or how many caps you gave dupers.
---
A mis brazos, compañero.
---
Anand yet you ignore how they have to be in melee range to hurt you.
---
My AA cryolator just might.. quick switch to the good old AAE handmade and it’s game over fam. 
---
No. You’ll scrapped something to didn’t mean to and then the complaints will blow up. No scrapping perks. 
---
Have fun!
---
So true, usb sticks are a 0.03 drop irl.
---
&gt;That “fresh start” is gunna be a massive game changer;
---
Thankfully the people at Bethesda seem to be sensible enough not to let this "fresh start" go through. The duping problem has been fixed. At best, this "frest start" is a band-aid approach to a problem that doesn't even exist any more.
---
I agree it should be rare, but not that rare. It should have been rare enough that if you put a good amount in, youll get atleast 1 rare. But not, you grind all week and get nothing.
---
I think it’s equally insane how crazy people are getting about cosmetic masks. Part of the point is that they are rare and we trade them. Who ever said everyone is supposed to be able to get them all? If that, and not understanding that a BETA is a BETA causes someone to leave, I say good riddance. 
---
can you make adrenal reaction serum and sell it to cool xbox players...
---
I told u 2 stay away from the fucking blast zone....
---
That was the hardest plan to get. I bought it from Grahm (only needed 4 times to spawn in his inventory).
---
I would very much like this.
---
I believe they mentioned Sony not cooperating a long while ago, so it must be possible.
---
It's not as bad as you think, I can do this with the mod, pvp as it stands does not last long enough for this to be a viable tactic. As long as the switch has to occur in the card load out menu then you'll be dead 3 times over before you can switch cards and draw new weapon.
---
 It's an invaluable tool for pve that far outweighs the possible imbalance it could create in pvp. (which goes away entirely if it's baked into the game and everyone has it) 
---
Lol salty azz, get grinding those legendaries or get left behind
---
Exactly that, there is a counter to anything. I am now 100% sure you are within the players tier that can fight my god-toon on a level field.
---
it wont change a thing, in a few days you will get rocked the same way if you transferd your old account, unless you have time to play 20 hours a day like the 900 hours dude
---
Not salty, kid, just not interested. Is that ok with you?
---
Also it doesn't seem complicated to implement.
---
&gt;I think you can tell we were all on board until you mention some weird communist shit.
---
It's called a "joke"... You know, since a big part of the Fallout franchise's storyline revolves around America's fight against communism?
---
&gt;Change my mind
---
Any time someone says "change my mind" like that, they're *really* saying "I'm not going to change my mind no matter what you say, and I'm probably not going to argue in good faith either."
---
They all jump on the hate bandwagon, lot of them probably never even played FO76
---
The main problem with 76 is that good rewards are literally *never* the result of you being good at the game. Instead, they are totally random. What's the point of making essential plans, mods and outfits super elusive?! What does this add to the game? Is hopping servers for 5 hours straight an engaging, interesting and fun experience? Rewards in 76 should be something that you *earn* for doing something difficult or elaborate - not hope for a random drop from a random enemy.
---
The legendary vendor could be the saving grace to the RNG madness... but I have a very dark premonition that this new system might add even more randomness and gambling to the game. And when the "Raids" are finally being released I pray to Atom that, instead of rewarding random crap, we will get some form of new currency/tokens which we can then exchange for specific gear. If I know, that I need to complete an event 20 times in order to be able to afford exactly the weapon i want, then this is something reasonable and interesting that I can work towards. And after finally getting this item, I feel a sense of accomplishment. If, however, I know that the chance of getting a specific item I want is 1:2000, then I might do the event a couple of times and then turn off the game for good...
---
I don’t even like the rare ones beside the skull. I think the common owl witch and giant look the best. 
---
it wont matter, you would get killed the same way unless you can keep up with everyone, the lvl differences will grow with a day or two off the mode been released.
---
That's really cool!
---
I agree with you, that's a fair compromise
---
When the devs change the code, maybe?
---
Don't be sad :( *\*offers him some Nukashine\**
---
I am i the only one that doesnt cares at all about the event? 
---
yeah, a normal person that has to work/family can not keep up with someone that has 8 hours or more a day to play. I think the same way you do. wheather is with and OP build or with a pipe pistol you will die the same way
---
Although people could fast travel, place their camp, then join survival but if the pay caps to move their camp I suppose that's fine.
---
Instigating and Executioner won’t spawn on the same item. There’s 3 tiers of effects. A 3* will have one * from each tier. You could get a 40% faster swing speed with one of those effects but not both. 
---
Lack of attention is their issue
---
It's different for weapon and armor (and I'm not talking about cosmetic but DMG and DMG resistance) because it has a real impact in game. But the point is that it's not rare if everyone has it. May a 0,5% chance of drop would be a good compromise.
---
they do until lvl 50, after lvl 50 the only difference is that you can move skill points however you see fit
---
So are you going to say that we need "another reset" a few weeks from now when the leaderboards are packed with people who have found all the equipment you were worried about them having in Adventure mode?
---
If anything, *that's* what's short-sighted. You'll only have this "equal playing field" for a month, tops.
---
That will splinter the pvp player base so much.
---
Hoarding stealth boys :D
---
My apologies for the delay. Friend request sent.
---
If you’re on Xbox you can have mine
---
I’ll give you one for free later on tonight
---
On Xbox, if you buy the digital copy, any account can play F76. I bought one copy but my wife and I play together. She plays on my "home" Xbox and I play on the living room Xbox because as long as my account is online I can play my games anywhere. In fact, as long as I'm signed into the living room Xbox, any other account can play my games there too. 
---
I don't know if anyone would take the time to do anything malicious but it's not impossible. Takes 5 minutes to set up a new Xbox account. 
---
Just throwing out my perspective. I still think it's a good idea. If someone is dedicated enough to want to vote more than once, whatever lol. 
---
Gotten through with only three bots surviving, got toothy man. Did it with four, got toothy man. All five, ***toothy man won't leave me alone please send help I'm scared***
---
The irony is if you feel that way all the time then a little bit extra is a whole lot more and they’d need a ton more people working on the game than just the janitor. 
---
And yet all players will earn it under the same conditions. Works just fine on other games like Ark
---
Its not only caps cost. I love my camp and I cannot place it in any other location. Using that trick to me would not cost me 50 caps. It'd cost me few hours of work. If instead of having a nice house you have a great mobile tactical support platform camp, its your tactical choice and you should be rewarded for it.
---
Level scaling won’t do jack if a group of 2-4 roll in with matching sentinel/cavalier armor, TSE weapons, and dozens upon dozens of stealth boys each.  Duped items are still very much being used and abused; I know of people using and handing out/selling duped armor and weapons to this day.
---
I’ve killed maybe 1000 players in this game(rough exaggeration, but I promise I’ve killed more players in pvp than 95% of players).  
---
Out of  those 1000. There was maybe 3-4 along the way that managed to kill me.  
---
I chalked up a lot of this to early glitches.(explosive damage healing enemies) 
---
My friend. I don’t think many have the armor your talking about, and if they do, they are extremely peaceful and never claim workshops. Because all my bullets shred enemies. 
---
Cheers. 
---
Based on?
---
How much is worth a sentinel/cavalier assasin set ? I want to play in PA but apparently you have no chance whatsoever against a legendary set
---
Bots dying just reduces the chance of getting any mask. Nothing changes the odds of getting a rare mask.
---
Hahaha 
---
true but they would be low level characters with most likely Lvl 50 loot, If the mules are carrying anything over 1500 lbs then they can only destroy that loot not drop it or transfer it. 
---
From the March 13th Patch notes 
---
&gt; **Carry Weight Limit:** A new “Destroy” option will now appear in place of the “Drop” option when a player who has exceeded the absolute maximum weight limit of 1,500 pounds plus the character’s current carry weight views items in their inventory.  
---
&gt;Selecting this option will destroy the selected item. This can be repeated with additional items until the player’s total weight meets or falls below the absolute limit.  
---
&gt;While above the absolute weight limit, items can no longer be dropped, traded, or consumed. They can only be kept or destroyed.  
---
&gt;**Dev Note:** As part of our ongoing quest to improve the game’s overall economy, performance, and address items created as a result of exploit abuse, we’ve decided to implement a “Destroy” option for players who have surpassed the absolute weight limit. This should also help reduce cases of excessive item hoarding, as well as prevent duped items from being dropped and making their way into unsuspecting players’ hands. 
---
Yeah or building your camp in a location where you can foundation yourself in. Foundations can’t be destroyed and you could have your water purifiers and crops growing all day to keep you alive. I know of many places to do this without stacking foundations. 
---
Moat of those insanely high levels were thanks to exploiting the xp bug in whitespringa nuke zone.
---
It is, no point in changing your mind since you are right.
---
That is nice you have 800dr, but he had 75% armor piercing perk. 
---
Also there are AA guns with 50% reduction, or other perks.
---
So lets nerf whole game, because you died haha.
---
And no one will actually play the game. They might as well have just added a BR mode.
---
You’re not interesting? Yeah I figured, gtfoh with your salty eBay buying comments you just mad cause the RNG hate you. 
---
It will matter... because people won’t have optimal gear or builds in one or two days or god rolled items 
---
When the point of the game is pvp focused base game everyone should start from the same point. Otherwise it is just a glorified death match
---
That's the thing, like it or not, it's both.
---
Everything has been nerfed but melee, which can cause outrageously high damage.
---
I could say I have two full sets if not for the fact I have three left legs and only one right.
---
Just what fallout needs, more zany cosmetics instead of compelling narrative. 
---
If you had 1, you could trade with others to get the 1 you wanted. People would actually be willing to maybe sell them. I think the idea of this somehow jump starting the market again is false. Most people won't let go of something so rare and the trading of a few high priced items won't suddenly fixed what's happened before. But yes, people expecting to get all of them, with little effort, are stupid.
---
Everyone started  "on an equal playing field" when the game launched and yet some players currently have way better gear than others IN ADVENTURE MODE.
---
Why would a fresh start on survival mode lead us to a different situation a few weeks later ?
---
Some people just play more than others, deal with it.
---
Wow, someone got triggered by an opinion on the internet. Take it easy kid, you don’t want to burn out before you hit puberty.
---
Or is it something deeper than that? Are you one of the morons who spent real money on eBay buying computer game items? And you feel stupid about it. And my post reminded you of that? Oh dear..
---
Fast travel is limited to only some locations
---
Literally never had those problems.  So why would you?
---
I’m the same with my building! Smaller spaces means more budget to decorate and make the place feel like home 
---
Melee is ment to be strongest, it's the trade off you get for no range
---
I've only done the event 3-4 times, but usually it seems to start when I'm overencumbered and far away, or in the middle of something, so by the time I make it to Helvetia it's twice been during the actual parade, and twice been in the preamble stages. (Intestines &amp; so on). I always join in and do what I can, enemy wise, either way. I hope people don't think I'm freeloading when I couldn't get there straight away. 
---
Yeah mine took me ages too 😁 I wouldn't move it unless I had a good reason 
---
It's not a switch in modes you select your mode at the menu. I'm thinking when logging in you'll have to chose a spawn area. 
---
Even if this is the case it won't stop players from utilizing mobile camps just drop camp where you want to spawn.
---
I didn't noticed change in killing people since beta. Try stabing someone with  AAE handmade, you won't think it is OP anymore.
---
I had a camp in the Forest trigger a defense event that told me sheepsquatch's are attacking my base, i shat myself and fucking bolted to the workshop in glee only to discover mole rats n' nothing more, so lets hope they are not going to be another level 1 to 29 enemy, I predict they'll be a decent level but ya never know really. 
---
It already is meta, is your mind changed? 
---
And this makes the decision to resign from your current one enough payment to allow the trick you mentioned as legit.
---
How does that "transfer the problem"?
---
A Survival+ would be perfect for you people who want the reset. You wouldn't be able to transfer characters from either Adventure or Survival to Survival+, which is pretty much all you guys want.
---
Have you seen someone naked?
---
Survival mode should be separate from the other game modes, and should be seasonal, like Diablo. When the season starts, people must start a new character for survival mode. The level 5 PvP limit could probably still exist for this, to prevent chaos at the start or to prevent camping newbs. After a few months, the season ends, and all characters on survival are transferred to adventure.
---
No, that’s because they are crouched fam 
---
My expectations are pretty low to be honest. I think this mode will not be ready for at least a couple months and that is why Bethesda are naming it Survival BETA. They want us to be paying Beta testers for second time. That is genius, right? 
---
It's not different at all. Cosmetics impact enjoyment as much as how many things you can one-shot or how much of a beating you can take. People in past games often sacrificed DR and DMG for aesthetics, so people clearly appreciate cosmetics and believe them to be important.
---
As for rarity, 20~ people across all platforms have confirmed to have the rare ones. Out of possibly hundreds of thousands of people, that's _too_ rare. I'm not suggesting everyone should have it. I'm not asking for 50%, 20% or even a 5% chance. A measly one percent, hell, 0.5 like you said even. I want a _chance._ a guaranteed chance, not a guarantee, but a chance. A 14% chance for somebody playing 24/7 isn't fair. It isn't rare. It's bull.
---
Hence the anger.
---
The only guard posts and concrete barricades I know of are those unlocked by default.
---
The junk walls from Fallout 4 didn't make it into 76...
---
So your not familiar with games that actively separate pve from pvp are you?
---
I do, probably going to grind out a new character to around level 60 before the launch. And just transfer all my shit over to it and make that "survival" character.
---
I bet a bloodied dragon you're wrong. Shit or any bloodied weapon.
---
By switch I meant "server hop" - go back to menu and choose other mode. Agree its not 100% clear so I clarified.
---
Also if you build your camp not for cool looks but for map control and PvP, its cool IMO. The funniest PvP encounter I had was when we started fighting with my neighbour and our camps started shooting each other.
---
Proof?
---
i really love your coin suggestion that would be such a saving grace in the great grind that is Fasnacht.
---
I’d honestly be down with the first time you transfer a character you’d be naked. It wouldn’t be long before you found something new that wasn’t a duped shotgun. Plus I can craft just about anything at this point so I’d do ok. 
---
My b didn’t see your comment but if you’re on tomorrow shoot me a message GT ATXlien and we can link up. 
---
DCG= deathclaw Gauntlet or as I like to call it the Ass/Sent worst nightmare 
---
With mutation you can stand and be invisible,. But what about camo paintjob for PA? isn't it more powerful? 
---
I run a tank build around my aae pump so I know. 
---
I had my backup loadout on at the time as I was just gringing for resources.
---
That would certainly be really helpful. I find the markers really difficult to follow as well sometimes 
---
I don't understand the downvotes. So what if this is old info? First I'm hearing of it.
---
I think if you server hop it will make you choose a spawn location. I doubt they overlooked tgis but then again duping was known about in beta so I could be wrong.
---
Also I'm jelly I'd have loved to watch my camp fight another camp lol
---
I forgot to mention, im pretty sure he was bloodied.
---
A high end dragon should be a one hitter since its only one shot. These bloodied swing speed melee weapons are just dumb.
---
i hope so! because i really want to watch it with my sweet Brahmin Lady Pustilio,
---
How do you spawn a brahmin
---
The game saves your progress and inventory in the cloud. So whenever you log in it has to synchronise with the server.
---
I mean in theory but we are in West Virginia, odds are a few red necks survived, they can see camo 
---
You unlock them automatically after claiming a workshop. You don't even need to keep the workshop.
---
There will always be "OP" if we keep nerfing PVE will suck. Then no one will play PvP is just a small part of the game.
---
Everyone  started  on an equal playing field when the game launched and yet some  players currently have way better gear than others IN ADVENTURE MODE.
---
Why  would a fresh start on survival mode lead us to a different situation a  few weeks later (or a few month if you think that it'll be harder to  get gear in survival, but it will eventually happen no) ?
---
Some  people just play more than others, deal with it. If you want fair and  balanced PVP then play CS:GO. That can't happen in fo76. The division  tried and failed, i don't think Bethesda (we are talking about bethesda  here...) will succed either.
---
Finally, someone who "gets it".
---
I am familiar with lots of games. I am used to games with full loot drop. What is a good design decision for game with situation X may be terrible for game with situation Y. I myself prefer full loot drop games, but to have that you need a game where its mainly your character that counts, not the gear - gear is supposed to be easily farmable in such games if you are good. If they made F76 full loot drop game, it'd became unplayable. If they removed all legendary equipment, which they won't do, and then made it full loot drop, it would be awesome!
---
I am now extremely familiar with F76 and I am discussing F76 game design considering already existing F76 aspects. I haven't been wrong in my predictions related to F76 yet. Please reconsider your position and stop assuming lack of knowledge on my part.
---
Everyone  started on an equal playing field when the game launched and yet some  players currently have way better gear than others IN ADVENTURE MODE.
---
I was just replying his message and when I pressed post it said he had deleted it. I guess he didn't want the world to see what a loser he is
---
To be fair, it can be hard for players to know exactly what to do for many aspects of this parade event because the many people who have done it a million times usually run around completing everything before new comers even have the chance to investigate. 
---
Yep same here. If you load into world at the Biv's place the door to get inside doesn't load until after the weird second load we are all getting.
---
Don't worry, the rare masks will be added to the Atom Shop.
---
I'll check it out and I've only PvP'd a handful of times. I mostly want the weekly weapon rewards... except the switchblade why would Bethesda add that. Whelp if I want to break out my Greaser gear and RP I'll be all set
---
Whether they allow character crossover or not there will definitely be people who exploit the game and gain an unfair advantage.  If you know what you're doing you could have a godly character by level 30. I doubt there will be that much pvp anyways. It isnt as though it's open pvp without wanted levels and bounties. The rewards dont outweigh the negatives. Ultimately you killing other players just benefits someone else not you.
---
I'd agree, but not everyone has time to grind forever for some stuff. What might take someone 6 hours to grind instead of 3 in one day could take someone else several weeks. I think transfers should be allowed, but be similar to Ark where if you have decent stuff you need to go and pick it up from somewhere when you join a new server
---
he's deleted all of them. not sure what his point was, or what he was trying to achieve..? he didnt actually offer an opinion, to the contrary, or any kind of rational argument pro or con. he just wanted to troll, I guess. don't know if he's a loser, but he's not that bright, either way.
---
If nothing else, it gets far better group participation than most other events. I hit it every chance I get just for the rarity of some good spirited co-op!
---
If you're on PC I'll trade you for a Toothy man or Giant.
---
By Goodsprings do you mean Whitesprings lol?
---
No. How about you present your case and see if it holds up to scrutiny. 
---
Why is cavalier armour better than sentinel?
---
it happened to me yesterday, 
---
I got wanted because I picked a lock in a near of a claimed shop, then i went to do the event and they couldnt hit me becuase I was doing the event once that is started you cant pvp. but right after that i told everyone to kill me it was a wonderful time. I was flying in 1000 peices it was wonderful.
---
I was serious, change my mind on why survival mode should not be reset, but instead make weapons and armor have no lvl or stat advantage.
---
Well, I best stop trying to get a fox :( 
---
“I played a pvp event, and never expected to pvp. Then at the end I was forced to pvp and now my junk is gone. “
---
“Let’s not discuss why I joined a pvp event in the first place, but that melee needs a nerf” 
---
Lol 
---
This is a rough translation for anyone interested. 
---
They will be added to the Atom Shop, obviously.
---
I literally spent more hours testing builds than it took me to finish mass effect trilogy. This is a highly substantiated opinion. I am a PvP focused player that does not have any satisfaction from attacking people, I prefer defending myself or other people instead. I want my opponents to be willing to fight. What I suggest I suggest against my best interests and in favor of casual players because I already have so many advantages I need some disadvantages. For player such as me - having access to all the god-items I want - allowing other players to keep their equipment is a disadvantage, since in a fresh start I will be powerful much quicker than anybody besides top tier of nerds, and currently there are lots of casual players that are PvP-ready now, but would need many weeks to be PvP-ready again.
---
The witch mask is rare? I got 3 in a row and tossed two. 
---
I could take on 3 SB at level 60 it isnt hard. Pick the right perks. 
---
If you are on PC then this could be arranged kind sir
---
No harm in a suggestion 
---
People on Reddit are more for restarting chars for survival. But people on Reddit are also the more hardcore of the player base. Having some way to poll everyone would be useful, as the OP suggests but Im not sure it would actually produce the result they’re hoping for with respect to survival mode.
---
Lol no PS4 but I'm going to move my camp near my brothers tonight and attack him XD
---
If the PvP starts when they walk up and hit you, then you are in melee range. Events like monster mash you are in melee range as soon as you enter a room.
---
&gt; **Why so angry with the rare masks ?**
---
Entitlement complex.
---
That's a little facetious though. I get why people might be upset that the supposed drop rates are really low, particularly if Bethesda hasn't telegraphed that this will be a recurring event or that there will be some other way to obtain these items in future. Gives a very grindy impression which is only worsened by the event being only available for a very limited time.
---
Having said that though, some of it is certainly an entitlement complex. They must be able to get ALL the things and desperate server hop and farm incessantly for it just so they can have it, or it fills some hole in them or whatever the reason is.
---
This makes sense. I was able to do a Biv quest on an evening and then again the next morning here in the UK, which was only a 6 hour gap. But a few days later I left the same amount of time between two attempts on the same day and it didn't work.
---
GTFO of here with that common sense bullshit /s
---
I only wanted the beret which i got now, so now im stocking up on some spare masks and plans. So when player vendors come i can sell them for a good coin to people who never did the event.
---
I predict it will survive 4, no, 5 hits from my mole miners gauntlet. 
---
This is my stand too. Originally my stand was that characters should been locked, but my point of view changes. Being able to jump between modes is much better implementation, that benefits everyone. Currently this is like how Division works- you have PVE map and then when you want you can go into darkzone that is PVP map. Exactly like that is the current/upcoming F76- you have Adventure Mode what is PVE and when you want to PVP you go into Survival Mode.
---
Locking characters into different mode also means that you have now playerbase splitted and this also means markets is. It is much more appealing to have one big playerbase than have multiple little ones.
---
In simple standard kills the corpse does not get flung away too bad, usually reserves to one spot (ish). If it is a death where there is a lot going on, ie. Multiple explosions and deaths, that is when the ragdoll gets messed up. Same applies for most online games.
---
Aren't you like a few months too late?
---
My parents are going to get a set of these way before me via health insurance when they're like 96.
---
Why don’t you just make a new account. 
---
I think this could be an excellent exp source though. How fast can you get killed if you're server hopping every 2 minutes? If I literally carry no junk or aid items I have nothing to worry about. There aren't any other downsides to dying. 
---
Ever attacked anyone while standing still and not moving?
---
If PvP starts when they walk up to you and hit you then you have to be aware of their location and make judgement calls.
---
Hey sir in a different post of mine you have just took an inspiration and planned your evening activities (relocating your camp near your brothers). Please reconsider your stance towards what I wrote because there's much more knowledge put into that post than to all the posts of "please separate the servers" type COMBINED.
---
...or let people make whatever comments and suggestions they want and let the community decide on whether or not it's worthy of comment and upvotes.
---
&gt; I f\*\*\*\*ing hate when people come to "help" me when i do my job. Just stop, i got my job because i know how to do it. Those lovely developers must have same feelings. 
---
I'm sorry, are you a dev at BGS? 
---
If you're not, maybe let Bethesda speak for themselves regarding this matter? I'm sure that if it bothers them that much that they want it to cease, they'll let us know.
---
Everyone in the server maybe not, but nobody on the whole reddit? That's insane.
---
It will also be over in a few days, so whatever the drop % is it's not enough. If hundreds if not thousands of players haven't got any rare mask it's gotta be a bug, or a typo or something, because it's less than 1% drop and it's a limited time event. Unless they dare to put them in the Atom Shop in exchange for Atoms, which would be the worst thing Bethesda could possibly do.
---
Digital copy tied to gamertag. I would have to buy the game again and pay for a new Xbox live subscription. 
---
What if the number between 0 and 1 isn't random? What if it is actually the bots health (100% = 1)?
---
So all 5 bots surviving gets you a mask, and each bot with NO damage taken gives you a chance of a rare mask.
---
It’s certainly a layer of friction compared with hitting PrtScr...
---
While I had a lot of fun with this game, I can only look at it as an early access title from and indie studio with a price tag of 20-25 bucks. 
---
\-outdated combat
---
\-outdated UI
---
\-standard features missing
---
\-no content
---
\-no balance
---
\-ducktaped ancient engine
---
And I'm not expecting much this year, they were atleast 1 year behind release schedule.
---
I’m starting a new guy and working my way up playing only survival. I think it will make this game worthwhile again for me.
---
No fresh start anyone who puts a shit ton of hours into PvP will be at a major advantage over casual players. Also players will trade for gear and straight up buy that shit from ebay. Where is the balance there?
---
What about the casual player who wants to get the weekly weapon awards? Should they have to put in 5 hours a day just to be competitive? 
---
If they require new accounts within a week you'll see posts bitching about how PvP players are OP and new players don't stand a chance. Yes even if you group players by level. They'll mule and trade low level OP equipment.
---
Ya no sh*t I've done this event at least 25 times... See 5 masks..
---
Witch
---
GIANT
---
Owl
---
Toothy man
---
Soldier
---
Bethesda made it pretty clear through Pete Hines that there weren't going to be any plans to. Plus how do you reconcile the issue of mouse and keyboard accuracy vs controller? 
---
There's a reason why there aren't that many cross platform games. It's not just a Sony issue.
---
Wow looks awesome up there. Thx for sharing. Oo  
---
Reminds me of a piece of art standing somewhere in germany.. I can't remember where exactly.  
---
A lot of words were said, statistically some of them should be good, but they weren't.
---
How would ebay have anything to do with this if you couldnt transfer stuff from adventure?
---
Committed people with lots of time will level up anyhow. If I won't be able to play this game for 2 weeks because of reasons (or even 1 week), I'm sure the server would be full of high levels already once I got the chance to play the game.
---
Huh? I was being sarcastic ( /s ) I'm against fresh starts in Survival. Sorry about the confusion
---
nice! I feel better after reading your post
---
Hi, I'm someone with some "actual" responsibilities in life, I'm currently plodding through at my own chilled out pace. (A level 37 on my only character and had it since launch) I've come across griefers once, most high level players either ignore me or help me. 
---
I understand your experience might be different, as it may be with everyone, but the comment you replied to made some really good points. You then got super defensive and called someone the fabled "someone who has nothing better to do than play video games all day" on a specific game subreddit no-doubt. 
---
So step-down from your "I'm an adult!! I deserve attention!! I had to pay a bill this month!" high-horse and have a constructive debate rather than coming back looking like someone who is far far from an adult
---
I respect your decision.
---
Just, wow... Are you for real?
---
&gt;If you're obsessed with "everyone being  equal", then you won't be happy two weeks after Survival comes out  either
---
You sound confused: If everyone starts equal, I WILL BE happy for faaaar longer than two weeks
---
&gt;since enough people will have obtained all the uber-powerful  TSEs and other fun equipment to be at the same level as if they would  have been if we just let them transfer characters from Adventure to  Survival in the first place.
---
At same time you could have obtained same stuff. You don't deserve to be in survival environment at first place if you farm-leveled your character in kindergarden mode
---
&gt;What then? Do we "start over" every month or so just to make sure everyone is "equal"?
---
Either you're confused again or didn't get the idea. Thanks to the level grouped servers you can start survival whenever you want and you'd still play with people sameish levels as you. 1-15 / 15-25 / 25-35 / 35-49 / 50-above
---
Ah if you are familar with them then you realize the point of playing a PvP focused version of the game is to actually play the game with that constant threat of PvP. Other wise you turn it into a shitty version of a CoD Death Match lobby. 
---
If you can freely swap then there is literally no reason to ever be on survival mode for more then a couple hours at a time. Which completely undermines the entire point of the game mode. Case in point with Ark Survival Evolved. There are two kinds of servers on official and even unoffical PvE and PvP.  They are kept isolated from each other because while you can upload your character to transfer to other worlds you can not cross the PvE and PvP barrier.   
---
In part because no one would ever build on a PvP server. You would be putting your entire building and all dinos and supplies at risk of another player attacking.  And another reason because it would be extremely easy to tame, breed and grow an army of dinos in PvE mode were you don't have to worry about another player attacking you. Then transfer that over to PvP mode to dominate everyone.  And you can just troll and aggrivate people without any risk because you can just transfer out of danger into the safty of PvE to recover. Supporting and enforcing negative ass hole behavior that exists on any video game.  
---
When people play on PvP servers they know going into the game there will be people who have put more time in. They know there will be large tribes that have claimed chunks of the map. That is the point of PvP to have that risk at all time.
---
I too have kids and work ab ungodly amount of hours so I'd never have a chance to even come close to competing in Survival from a fresh start. 
---
Or better, make it like ESO, when your compass points to a marker, it tells you which quest it is.
---
Didn't know that. Thanks for the info!
---
Well the Survival Mode is just a mode like- Ohh, hey I am tired of easy Adventure Mode, Ill go to Survival Mode. But maybe you are getting killed too much and feeling that you are just losing resources, you can jump back into Adventure mode and try again later.
---
You are not forced to play in there. If you are bad at PVP or under geared, it is fine to stay in Adventure Mode. This Survival Mode aint-"Ohh hey I just started and I should be on par with players who have been playing since release"
---
Gear aquired via survival would be in high demand and players would sell it. 
---
thank you. i will probably try it, just to see what it's like, and maybe even change my mind. either way, i hope it's what youre looking for, in this game. enjoy!
---
&gt;they'll let us know
---
It is completly safe to tell your customers to gtfo with spaming agresive opinions. Because you know, when you are part of big company, you can say whatever to whoever. Haha yea
---
Bump and upvoting! There’s a saying  in IT,  Know the difference between giving users what they want, vs what they need. 
---
There is another side effect of character separation. Black market. There is a certain level of dedication that makes earning on games a possible activity. While it's against ToS, I'm living in eastern europe and historically, the way to feed your family was to effectively dodge occupying countries 'ToS'. This remained common in mentality around here, and considering that for 3 good $ trades you could earn a minimum wage here, I am not surprised seeing people resort to that. I know of one person that traded items for real money, and he is severely in favor of separating the servers, because he wants to participate in a new and fresh market pool to maximise gains from black market trades.
---
TL;DR you support 'mafia' if you support character separation.
---
calm down itll be k
---
I think you’re missing the point. Duping is over but the damage is permanent. There are gunna be players with 100,000’s of caps, the game economy is irreparable ruined at this point, you will be facing opponents with a literal unachievable status (due to updates limiting certain features/bugs). 
---
I don’t really see your appeal at all. You want to join a game mode that’s geared towards a more difficult, time extensive, and conflict focused experience? But you want face opponents already geared out, with enough supplies such as ammo created from duping, and all this without the ability to fast travel?
---
I'm so disappointed to read this. I downloaded Fallout 76 and everything just to play survival mode. That is absolutely terrible if people can just start max level with high end gear. It completely ruins the fun.
---
Well you might aswell ban trading then alltogether? I really dont see ebay as an issue, 99.9% of the players wont buy weapons from ebay with real money
---
Nah, I don’t want to start over. It wouldn’t matter past the first week anyway. There’s always going to be someone higher level than you, and it’s gonna be XxxPussySlayerxxX, even though you know he’s getting none dropping 900 hours into a video game. 
---
NO U
---
PS4 player here.  
---
It sometimes flickers and I can't activate trade at all for some players. Expecially in power armor this is too much.  
---
I also had a problem where the trade will just abruptly stop. The Items will glitch kinda random I guess and appear as if you had bazillions of it. In the inventory all is good thou.  
---
Had to reload to get rid of that error.  
---
Yep want to know too
---
but me
---
I've done it for a total of 14 times over three days without serverhopping. Did have my game crash, but rejoined my team. Twice didn't get a mask at all. Have six toothy man and at least one of each common mask. Never seen anyone show a rare mask.
---
Yes, Batteries Included in the INT 'tree'. 
---
[Here you can see, how chameleon works.](https://youtu.be/btmPkBYRPT0?t=112) His name and level is invisible, until i spoted him from close range (i had 13perception by that time and i find him only because how bethesda made voice chat icon, that is not posible now).
---
It is possible to get the monster mash mask out of the high school. Im not sure how but I walked out with it when I went in for plastic and experience. I grabbed the mask then ignored the candy pumpkin's. After the event was supposed to end it still showed the pumpkins and I grabbed a couple and left. I didn't even realize the mask wasn't supposed to come with me. It was fun for a couple days then got annoying with the constant cheering so I gave it away.
---
Yeah, I was thinking abt that too 
---
I don’t need THAT many respec points, but I’ll take what I can get lol
---
Now just stay there until PvP comes out and reap the legendary rewards for being alive for days on end lmao 
---
Thanks, thought it might be but wasn't sure :)
---
First off, I call BS on the claim that you can get 60% of the effectivenes of full Assassin/Sentinel with crafted items.  And until it's explained, I'm going to assume it's an exploit.
---
Secondly, I do agree with what you are saying.  However, there is at least one thing that both sides of the argument are missing.
---
You can only fast travel to your Camp, Vault 76 and Stations, you can't effectively cover all the good level farming spots and if you do PK someone at one, they just need to take note of how many are with you, put a bounty on whoever got the final hit and go somewhere else.  This applies to both newly created characters or transfered characters.  On the other hand, camping good experience locations is also a good way to get yourself killed.
---
Placing the bounties marks you as a target for anyone who wants to try, but since you could be in a group, and you could be in a location not worth the caps to travel too to PK, all becoming wanted will really do, is show people where/who to avoid.  And with 20% more experience, on top of sleeping bonus and Cranberry Cobbler for 30% total, you could actually level pretty quick at some "off the beaten path" areas.
---
In short, both sides are exaggerating how hard it will be for new or lower level players to level to the point they can actually, really participate.
---
Oh, and I guess it is always worth noting in these gaming situations, that if you drive off new players who want to participate in PVP, they'll either go back to Adventure mode or play something a little more friendly towards new players.  Eventually, it will just be the high level "OP build" players in Survival, trying to guess where each other is since they have no reason to really grind or farm legendaries(at least not in Survival), until people survive long enough to get a huge target on them and then it could get fun.  Hell, if in a group, at that point I definitely would start killing my friends and I'd expect them to do the same.  Call it us testing each other.  No hard feelings, just being bored.
---
Everyone who has anything you don't must be cheating. Right, whats with this subreddit lately?
---
Now all we need is the chaotic hogh-speed version and we're good to go!
---
No matter how hard you look, you won't see me.
---
i understand you, i guess im been a little selfish becuase I have been playing from the start and always getting ready for pvp. but I understand what you are saying. that wont change the fact that its only a temporary solution because lets say the mode its been release for a few months and you have the god teir gear and I start playing the game you will be game years ahead of me no matter what, not to mention the ppl that have ungodly amounts of time to play. i know for sure im not going to be able to keep up with them but its part off it. never the less I understand you and were you are coming from. i can only think you are going to understand from where im coming from, the feeling of playing over 100 hours of getting ready for pvp to having to start from scratch. but it is what it is. 
---
I’ve found 2-3 inside west tek, but I think those are mostly random.
---
nOoOo It MuSt bE cHeAtOrs, i dOnt HaVe OnE!
---
I think some people in here are losing their minds with conspiracy theories. 
---
Haha, I know, I've just seen a lot of posts from people concerned it will be too unbalanced if existing characters are allowed in.  I guess we'll see how it works in beta.
---
The rare ones are: Jester, Goblin, Sun, Old Man Winter, and Skull. There was a post where they took the results of a poll people took. Assuming the 2 people who said they got the masks weren't lying or got them from the Dev room, the chance at the masks is .03%. I believe a dev also confirmed that was close to the actual number, but I could be wrong on that.
---
Pleasure. 
---
Ohh, I didn't even think about that. Yeah, you are right. If you open up new server, it creates "need" in economy, means now real money traders have new audience, that want to buy from them. 
---
Are you doubting the low-res map, with black smudges and a random “?” on one of its corners?
---
Noooo, that seems totes legit.
---
EXACTLY! They add this with the intent for people to want to grind it, but the drops are so low people don't want to. The time spent to the rewards curve isn't worth it.
---
I mean that’s not happening. I’ve found instances where I exit a building and can’t do shit or see much while I’m being slapped around the park by ghouls or scorched.  Thankfully it’s not happened while any high level foes have been around.
---
Hmm I see some valid points, and I believe our concerns might actually coexist and not exclude themselves.
---
In the example of ARK, there are lots of assets you could farm, use to your advantage, and loose if fight goes bad. In Fallout there is nothing similar that could be lost. A god-roll gun is infinitely harder to replace than a dino. You can't craft to replace your losses if you lost your armor in Fallout.
---
I must admit that my perspective is skewed to certain worldview and playstyle, aka, "this is Fallout and I'm a badass, I'm only playing on survival servers so I can always shoot rude players at will". I'm disinterested in adventure because of lack of the tension from not knowing if player encounter will go ugly.
---
Solution that would satisfy both our concerns would be to separate servers but allow one-way transfer of existing characters. I am afraid it'd create as many problems as it would solve tho.
---
You'd be suprised at how dumb people are $25 for a TSE they wouldn't cost that much if people weren't willing to pay it.

Announce in Discord that you are nuking prime, when you are starting prep phase or even sooner.
---
Monster mash is always PvP. I've also been killed without agreeing to PvP. 
---
So Cool
---
If you use power armor you can’t get hit otherwise you insta die so you have to use the jet pack  to get the high ground or stagger them to death. 
---
Got iabout nine Giant Man mask so far.  Got told not to keep too many or I could get banned for duping? 
---
Since last patch most definitely. The amount of steel and plastic you can now get from it makes life a lot easier.
---
Get the masks to sell/give away later.  I've been dropping my dup masks at the end of the event for others to grab.(a solo player and not a trader)
---
obligatory r/fo76FilthyCasuals mention
---
Yes but not nearly as many people are that insanely obsessed with the game. 
---
yeah I read that one, and saw my chances to collecting all of them impossible. than you by the way
---
Then you need to shoot them before they get within melee range. Your lack of of situational awareness is not a disability of the game. 
---
This
---
Honestly, don't care about these masks.
---
I mean purely in the sense of overall balance. Even if they did make it so you couldn't transfer to survival eventually you'll still have OP characters in survival. All I'm saying is that level matching helps with balance, regardless of whether characters are transferrable or not.
---
&gt;I don’t really see your appeal at all.
---
And I don't see yours at all.
---
&gt;You want to join a game mode that’s geared towards a more difficult, time extensive, and conflict focused experience? But you want face opponents already geared out, with enough supplies such as ammo created from duping, and all this without the ability to fast travel?
---
Have a problem with people joining survival with decent gear? Go farm some on Adventure and build your way up.
---
With this "reset" idea, the only people that will benefit are those with nothing better to do than grind for 12+ hours a day 7 days a week. Can't keep up? Sorry, you don't have a shot, you're not going to be alive long enough to get all that "cool gear".
---
It gets better. Do the missions and farm whitesprings if your able to, its easy junk and xp for killing ghouls
---
If junk is your problem, there's a workshop in Charleston with three Junk nodes that you can put Junk extractors on and it doesn't cost you any materials and you'll also get caps for taking the workshop and xp for the defend missions. 
---
What are you talking about? Why would we need another reset for hte leaderboards?  
---
What's the point in creating a so called 'hard mode' for characters but them still allowing them to switch between easy and hard? Surely that defeats the purpose of having a hard mode?
---
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what mode you play. There will be always somebody who can play longer than you and who will be better at the game than you.
---
Yes a player 3 weeks a head of another player will be in a better position, but in order to get there and hold resources is going to be far more difficulty if characters are bound to the more difficult mode therefore closing the gap between the rich and the poor. If you don't want to start fresh or are afraid of any challenge that will come with survival then nobody is stopping you from continuing your adventure mode character. Bu allowing players to freely migrate between survival and adventure the developers are essentially making the point of survival mode... pointless. It isn't outlandish to have to separate difficulty modes that don't crossover you know? 
---
20% xp boost sounds great on paper, but many will be fighting for the same areas to farm so probably not going to be very efficient levelling up when you've got absolutely decked out adventure mode characters coming in with nothing to lose.
---
Cavalier works only when sprinting?? Can you sprint and shoot? 
---
Same guy
---
What a lot of people do is just buy another game copy and log in + friend that client, a level one character will do. Fresh out of the vault, can hold 1500 pounds and doesn't lag game servers because you only log it for a few minutes to transfer crap.
---
Yeah it costs money but due to the sheer nerd rage this game got in publicity, a lot of stores will sell it for like 1/4 of the retail price. I pre ordered this game for $100 and got my mule copy for $20.
---
This has the advantage of being able to store tonnes of legendaries, ammo, scrap material across a few mules.
---
Anyway if you're not keen on that I've read that you can drop a paper bag, then join a players map via social tab (lists last played with characters) then run back there and pick it up. **I have not tried this and don't know if it works**
---
No, the dungeons/raids should bring only new weapons. Events like the Fasnacht not worthy enough for new weapons.
---
If you need junk, go on scavenging runs. Find some ruins, pick up fans, scrap dead enemies' weapons, repeat. Once you start earning more money, you can buy specific hard to find items like screws, gears, and springs from vendors. Since I don't use chems, I sell all of them for a quick buck. 
---
You shouldn't have to much trouble finding junk at such a low level. 
---
&gt;Just, wow... Are you for real?
---
Pick up your jaw from the floor and stop overreacting.
---
&gt;You sound confused: If everyone starts equal, I WILL BE happy for faaaar longer than two weeks
---
...Until you realize that by then the leaderboards are packed with people who have TSE/Bloodied/other uber-powered equipment, and the "reset" made no difference. 
---
The only thing that the reset will do is put those of us who don't have time to revolve our lives around the game out of luck. 
---
You're suggesting a broken band-aid of a fix for a problem which doesn't even exist.
---
I didn't really want to mention that in the main post because people downvote real-world trading discussions just for mentioning the taboo.
---
But it exists and game design decisions will influence it. There is a certain class of people - much more dedicated than the guy I know - that dives deep into new games, collectively cheats their way into godhood, and then earns as much as possible from the games black market. When the in-game market is healthy and satisfied, the cash flow on the black market dries. These people then jump onto another game where its easier to extract money.
---
These people largely left F76 by now. You'd see that if you'd store statistical data from reddit and discord markets. There are certain individuals there which could be used as benchmarks, and their activity dimnished. If we'd have survival servers separated, boom, they are back, server-bombing duping is back, duping is back and the things that the "separatists" wanted to fight is now rampant.
---
&gt; Implement a "coin system" Everytime that the event was complete the player receive a coin and if he didnt get the rare drop it can change like 50 coins for One
---
Yeah there should be something like this. Although, seeing how many Mr Fuzzy tokens you need to get anything I wouldn't trust them to get it right. Same with candies at Watoga highschool.
---
I don't really want the masks of this event (not my cup of tea, also the camp plans are much better rewards IMO) but the fact they made them so rare no one has them baffles me. This can be intended, and if it is I wonder what the hell were they thinking.
---
I’ve had other people appear in all sorts of points inside my camp, definitely not just where you first drop it. So often under a floor too. The strange part is, no new random teammate I’ve had get stuff (playing with mic off) seems to figure out they could just fast travel to the map marker just 50 meters away. Instead they jump in place and throw up Help! Dude, fast travel somewhere nearby and run here, takes 30 seconds. 
---
Tattered field jacket.
---
Thanks this is what I was looking for.
---
These masks are just going to collect dust and take up valuable stash space in about three days anyway. It’s not worth it in the long run.
---
Same here. Came to reddit for answers.
---
mostly melee but there's also moving target perk that helps 
---
Yeah and I know that’s a very good point but if you played from the start you would know endless amount of EXP glitches and so forth, from what I’m aware of those aren’t available so the masses won’t be extremely god tier just a select few let’s say 25% rather than 75% 
---
lets be honest...
---
lets say we are required to roll new characters for survival mode.  in about a week there will already be level 100 guys running around harassing the lower level characters.  Some people have more time than others and this will happen anyway.  I can only play a few hours a week where as other people play for 50+ hours a week.
---
Rolling new characters isnt going to change much or give any more of a level playing field.
---
Spoiler The BOS was recruiting at camp venture.  Described the class formulation on journals in the pc.
---
becuase the fallout games had made us all horders and we want to collect everything. 
---
not mad at all about it tho, it just sucks I wanted to collect them all. 
---
Cranberry bog
---
I think you are missing the point. It’s not the premade characters that I think will be the issue. It’s being able to switch between the modes at all times.
---
I hope it doesn’t play out this way, but I feel like not a lot of people will actually persistently play survival mode. Since the game will be allowing players to go back to adventure mode to resupply, that’s exactly what they will do. For a lot of players Survival will be a just a pvp battle arena and then they go back to adventure after they have had their fun killing and spent/lost their aid items. Don’t get me wrong, I want pvp to be a bigger focus in survival, but doesn’t this take away from the “high stakes” of survival if you can just resupply in easy mode once things don’t go your way?
---
Yeah there are safes in the tower buildings, one in the big warehouse, a few in the carts and one or two in the sheds near the fast travel point :)
---
&gt;You then got super defensive and called someone the fabled "someone who has nothing better to do than play video games all day" on a specific game subreddit no-doubt. 
---
No, I got defensive with the smug "No you're not!" "No you didn't!" comments from that guy. He's basically accusing me of being a liar, which is just fucking rude.
---
Welcome aboard. Don’t be afraid to buy Ballistic Fiber from vendors once you need it. It’s just way easier to buy it than find it, especially because people farm the easy spots. 
---
Junk isn't a problem, storage is.
---
Just start picking all kinds of stuff up and scrap it.
---
Rince and repeat!
---
after a while you will be begging Bethesda to increase the stash size XD
---
i have been saing the same thing, making everyone start from scratch its just a temporary fix, what happens 5 months down the road when new ppl come to play the game. the samething that will happen now will happen then as well. dont understand what the bitching is about. i have the feeling that people that complaint have none or very little experiance playing PVP. 
---
just play the game and learn from it.  not to mention that doesnt matter want you do you wont be able to counter every build out there woth just one character. 
---
I’ve been encountering protections that will drop 2 legendaries at that location. They seem to be dropped better crap than the ghouls. 
---
And btw. Regarding duping. I found a bug. It kicks you - and only you - from the server. Reproduction is very short and easy. It rolls back your equipment. I used it to loose the results of picking up junk locations for five times before I realised its not a server disconnection or some form of lag, but a functional bug with a 100% reproduction rate.
---
Let me reiterate: I have on my hands a duping method that is extremely hard to spot, takes less than a minute to execute, and costs nothing. I haven't posted this on reddit because obviously I don't want the community to know. I sent it directly to Bethesda. There is no guarantee that other people haven't found it. I just stepped into it like you step into shit by an accident. I was furious with the game kicking me out 5 times in 10 minutes before I noticed the equipment rollback, at which point I ceased being furious and became scared. I know I'm just a random redditor and my guarantee doesn't mean much, but I guarantee you that ridiculous duping methods are still in the game because I rolled back my inventory several times, loosing all my progress (and regaining all my spoiled meat) several times.
---
This "reset" is a band-aid of a fix for a problem that doesn't exist. It's not like people are going to never find good equipment ever again after a reset. 
---
In two weeks after a reset you're going to have the leaderboards filled with people who have all that god-tier gear you're worried about them having now, the only thing that gets accomplished is that those of us who don't have the time to grind for 12+ hours a day get fucked out of all the progress we've made.
---
Im the r/woosh (or sth like this) guy.
---
Thanks will check out. The spawn rate for the tec docs has deffo dropped since last patch, this will at least increase the chance.
---
  Hey! My increased lockpit armor has a use!
---
It's the Fertilizer item in your CAMP menu under Resources. It looks just like the hay bales and wheelbarrow, but it spawns a Brahmin in when you place it down.
---
If you don't have it unlocked, the plans are called Brahmin Pen.
---
If they are teamed up, then when you engage the wanted guy the whole team turns red. Or at least that's how it has worked on ps4.
---
It feels like event participation numbers are dropping.
---
Oddly enough I've seen ppl speaking in area but I heard nothing, went to check my chat volume and it was turned all the way down. I don't really mess with my volume settings and I don't remember changing it. Turned it up and heard a guy talking on the phone.
---
I left the chat volume up and just listened to a man take a call about car insurance.
---
Next time I got back on I double checked my volume settings and chat was back down again.
---
Interesting~🤔
---
It's all good
---
Did you use characters as mules?
---
My character is actually able to counter every build out there but I spent ridiculous amounts of time researching it into its current forms.
---
I don't want to be rude but you should seek help, we are done
---
Yeah for sure, I’ve been grinding for the BOS paints but only got as far as the officer paint job after what feels like 100 tech data :o. Good luck on your search! 
---
we pay we say, riot in world 66
---
that is true, let see how it plays out. it will be interesting, and for a fact i will be getting the popcorn ready to see all the people crying. lol
---
Well, I'm actually not against disallowing the return to adventure mode. I'm against disallowing current characters (many of which, such as mine, made with PvP in mind during the beta) into the survival servers.
---
I've made my points repeatedly, check my post history.
---
What will happen two weeks after a reset, people will have all the cool gear you're worried about them having anyhow. 
---
With a "reset", you're just fucking over people who don't have the time to grind up an all-new character and fixing absolutely nothing in the process. It's a broken band-aid of a fix for a problem that doesn't exist.
---
If you can't see that, there's no convincing you.
---
Survival mode will have 20% XP boost and if you are well rested you have some more, so um, it should go relatively fast.
---
You won't be missed.
---
No ones saying you can’t make a new character, they’re just saying you’ve got a option to bring the old one back. 
---
If you force everyone to start fresh in survival, that will not stop folks from grinding all night and day, till they’re much taller then you anyway.  
---
I want the OP griefer  kids to get schooled. I want survival mode to be gladiators school. Slap damage once on pve, bam! Hot swapped into an all out pvpland.  If this is enabled,  am confident that this will stop the griefer abuse. 
---
What are you implying? If someone else has bugs that you don't, it must be their fault?
---
Or are you saying, all the people saying they have problems with bugs are lying about it?

There are a lot of technical issues in the game, if you enjoy it or not. A developer can't afford to release AAA games in this state, if they want to continue releasing AAA games. Even if you don't see those bugs, it has to concern you, if you ant to see more content in the future in this game or from this developer.
---
What? I don’t have a TSE of any kind, nor do I want one. I was simply stating that if the argument was to take away the dupe crap, then only one reset would be necessary.
---
what about a trading system
---
take them to  like a bot or a terminal. trade X amont off perk cards to get to pick the card you want. or trade a card or two to be able to pick a ramdom perk from a specific class. it will sure help with the rebuilding and will eliminate the extra perk cards. and maybe limiting the amount you can trade carads per day.
---
something like that would be cool to do, and the way I see it is a win win situation.
---
Screws and, springs arent that difficult to find, just explore locations, and check every room, cabinet, desks,... For usefull junk items.  I never rushed myself when exploring, i take my time checking every room .  Some players just enter a place, kill all the enemies and move on to the next place and then they complain they cant find the junk items they need .  In my opinion ballistic fiber is more difficult to find.  After every location run, i always bulk my springs because i have 100 in my stash and everything above 100  gets bulked and i  sell them to vendors, same for screws i sell my extra screws when it gets above 150 
---
So i dont understand why ppl say they cant find springs or screw tbh. 
---
Commie ghosts I tell you!
---
Title was a joke, I'm very disappointed
---
See? You just said your own problem and answered it with your own problem!
---
You just said you have time constraints so your answer to griefers is to farm PvE. So instead of playing PvP you have to spend time on PvE. 
---
&gt;Why would we need another reset for hte leaderboards? 
---
Well, we have to keep everything "fair" and "equal", right? That's what most of you are on about, that "everyone gets an equal opportunity!"
---
I've said it over and over: In two weeks after survival launches, people are going to have all that god-tier equipment anyhow. All you're doing is fucking people over who don't have the time or desire to grind up a new character.
---
What you propose is a broken band-aid of a fix for a problem that doesn't exist.
---
If you're scared of them just use an anti armor automatic weapon with the tank killer perk. It staggers people and if the sentinel gets staggered the effect goes away lel
---
Not Germany, Belgium. It's the Atomium I believe.
---
Which is one of those things when it comes to the internet, just say something along the lines of "It's my experience" and just move on 
---
I mean you guys just showed 2 different experiences and then both of you don't realize in an online game with people online, the experience is going to differ. 
---
You bit at someone being smug on the internet, by replying with a bunch of quotes being ruder and ruder. Ending with "I'm more important than you to society"
---
Hell yeah, I’m glad someone else finally noticed!

1. Circlejerk. People having fun with the memes, let them. If they're good, I too have to chuckle sometimes.

2. r/Fallout: Don't ever go there. It's a cesspool of hate towards anything which is a) not turn-based combat in 2d or b) not from Obsidian
---
3. Enjoy they game or don't: Fallout 76 has issues, you can't deny it. Bugs, crashes (worse for me now again after patch 7), unsuited interface, concept errors, badly working and balanced game mechanics etc. It's even hard in here to discuss those sometimes, when you post in the wrong moment you'll get downvoted before a real construcitve discussion can even start.
---
You wouldn’t be wanted but if those guys were teamed, it would be 3v1. Not sure if you’re geared well enough for that.
---
No npcs. Just deal with it. 
---
Smh. Why cant all these girls go play trolls with the rest of their girlfriends on the Bethesda forums. 
---
Certain junk gives better materials when scrapped. Learn what gives what and focus on collecting it. Anything that has multiple moving parts gives good materials when scrapped. Clip boards, fans, alarm clocks, etc. 
---
The issue is not really enough junk as too much junk imo
---
100% agree
---
This is why I will be running admantium skeleton in the pvp mode. 
---
Sorry, I get the two mixed up all the time XD. Yeah, it's Whitesprings.
---
You’ll only become wanted if you kill non-hostile players. However, if a player is with a team, the whole team will be tagged for PvP even if you only attack one player. You’ll know if you’re in PvP with other players, because their gamertags will turn red.
---
Be cautious of wanted players travelling with groups of people. From my experience, it’s usually a trap to lure people into attacking them, then have their friends attack and kill you.
---
Its the generally idea of following a tougher blindly. They don't understand that the game was fixed because those same YouTube's didn't make a follow up video.
---
Can you get the song the robot sings? 
---
Oh yeah, I agree with you there. All the people with OP pvp builds would just farm caps or whatever you get them again in a few weeks. I’m not really worried about that. Besides there are no player map markers so I think people are forgetting that if you want to avoid pvp in survival it may be easier than it is currently. Unless someone finds you. 
---
I mean, what the players would vote on would be practically insignificant and Bethesda does control what they put on their surveys. I think it is a good idea to listen to more players, and see what the players want. I think it’s a good idea to log onto fo76 and have a survey pop up which asks you to vote on either, say for example, chiding a new char for survival or not. It would have already been thought out by the devs, since it’s on the survey. So, in my opinion as a player who bought the game, this would be a good feature for the game, and would help the devs get a better picture of what their players want.
---
Sooner or later you will become a hoarder. Then you'll be like WTF I'm always overencoumbered. Then you'll figure out what to save and what to drop/sell
---
It's a vicious cycle for now just mark for search what your looking for. It's in the menu you can mark for search.
---
Grab every toy car, truck, Giddy-up Buttercup, typewriter, fan, and Ammo bag you see. Also scrap weapons at benches for steel.
---
I know I missed something but someone will comment with it. If you were on PS4 I'd hook you up with whatever junk you needed. It's a good community here I know someone on Xbox will help you.
---
Also as far as leveling goes you can go to Wavy Williards Water park and level easily at low levels. When that gets too easy/slow got to Camden Park and Welch. Missions provide good XP bonuses as well.
---
Also ask if any high levels want to help you level. They can take you to high level areas and quickly level you. Many of us enjoy doing this. Again I'm on PS4 otherwise I'd help.
---
And you're completely missing the point.
---
Survival is been sold to us as ramped up difficulty or a 'hard mode' for players that want more of a challenge. Allowing free migration between easy mode and survival mode defeats the purpose of having survival mode.
---
I don't get why that's so hard to grasp? And what the chuff does that have to do with server wipes due to the addition of a leader board?
---
Ha I was just searching for this info yesterday. Found bits and pieces spread across comments and posts. You summed it all up in one. Bravo.
---
Very realistic, in fact I believe they already had something planned with them considering you can interact with polling terminals and printers. They certainly could alter them to do other things too.
---
I wish they had built it in 
---
&gt;So instead of playing PvP you have to spend time on PvE. 
---
So? What's the problem with grinding in Adventure to get to a level you feel comfortable with before going in to Survival?
---
Or do you just enjoy the thought of a bunch of new, easy-to-kill players because you spend 12+ hours on the game, know where all the good farming spots are, and know how to get all the god-tier equipment?
---
There's no other reason for this "reset" other than that - And two weeks after launch of Survival we're going to see people with all that equipment you're worried about them having anyhow. 
---
This reset simply will. Not. Work. Again, it's a broken band-aid of a fix for a problem that does not exist.
---
Be methodical. Go to a place a pick it clean. Take everything until you learn what items give what and what you need. Never leave a gun behind. You can scrap it for junk and to learn mods. After that place, visit a crafting table to scrap. Visit a stash box to dump - it doesn't have to be your camp, train stations and Red Rockets work just fine. Then move to the next place or sometimes even next building. 
---
There's no rush. Kill all the enemies. Get all that xp.
---
Want to mix it up? Take a workshop. It gives you more xp, stims, water, resources, and plans for taking it and each time you defend. It's a free fast travel point, and building stuff there comes out of its budget not your stash as long as the materials listed are green. Plus, defending it against the waves of attacks that happen periodically (the system lets you know) breaks up what can be monotony of a junk run (if you have a regular circuit). Just make sure to store your junk when you are at a workshop.
---
Don't be afraid to be over-encumbered every now and again, but be sure you can make it to that box. 
---
If anything they should let us smoke. There's cigars everywhere. Blow peoples faces off but can smoke? 
---
I understand your lack of belief into my PA thesis because I was in the "what the actual fuck" mode myself when we have been testing it, but there's no exploits to that, its just perks doing what they say they do (maaaaybe dodgy perk card text is not really descriptive).
---
I am not the author of that design. I'm just part of one of this games many "inner circles", and a player that is even more dedicated than me used me to test his new experiment.
---
To me, the current conflict between "separatists" and "continuatists" is unresolved and could still influence the direction into which the game goes. If they separate the servers, in the first period of the game, before we gather actual loot, we will be using this build to assert our domination. If they decide to keep the character pool united, we will probably publish a PvP-godliness-introduction guide to ensure maximum pool of possible opponents. Until that moment comes, I respect your scepticism and your right to call unproven claims bullshit, but I refuse to publicise details of the work that's not mine.
---
Signed. Posted ideas about this also on their official Facebook community.

I dont think the jetpack is for $500. I’ve seen it at watoga, for much higher. I’m on PC.

Stupid Sony 
---
They could have voting events with special pins in the atom store after you vote for a side.
---
thats odd, im on xbox as well and i just had one crash yesterday and I was in my camp, but never during the event and I have done it like 25 times already
---
I have a tse minigun, will it stagger people without pa if i spam it on them ? 
---
I'd totally be down for something like that.  With permanent cosmetic rewards (for any mode) for those that meet certain thresholds.  
---
As an FYI, Extremely Rare and Exceedingly Rare items in games, tend to have a drop rate of 0.06% \~ 0.08%, and are just above Mythic Rare which tends to be a rate of 0.01% \~ 0.03%.  That's just the average across games with those types of items.  Some games go as high as 0.05% for Mythics but there's usually some random factor to them at that point(stats being the most comonly used).
---
The Enclave most definitely has a place for you.
---
Then you have just shone some light onto that matter for me. The "separatists", as I begun to call them, are actually two groups. One that doesn't want current characters, and they know shit, and one that doesn't want people jumping to adventure mode to farm and returning to survival mode at will, and they are survival players who want it tense. I will patronise the ignorant members of this first subgroup. I will be sure to respect the members of the other, the ones who want survival to be hard, just as I want it to be.
---
Pfft the game works fine. I never had a fraction of the issues the loudest people had. I swear it’s because they play on PC (and I’ve have virtually no issues on ps4) and really this and Fallout 4 are more console than PC games. Nothing about this games screams PC.
---
Thank God for Nukes
---
Duping. DUPING. There are people who have 100,000 bulk resources. They will own all workshops decked out with missile turrets. You are going to head into a PvP mode with against other players with a literally unobtainable amount of advantage against you.
---
Rare compared to the others that drop like candy.
---
Scourgebeast is Scorchbeast in English. Scourch is referring to the damage left on objects by heat and fire. Ultrazit is Ultracite in English. The suffix -ite just means rock or stone. So it means like "ultimate ore" or rock. Which is actually how I figured out you were using German, the suffix -it is rock and stuff in German right?
---
I think that suckiness could most definitely be mitigated with better, more frequent drops and the more exp in survival mode.  
---
Did the event numerous times with all 5 surviving and always got a basic mask and a plan. Did it once where only 2 robots survived and got no mask and just a plan. So I think completing with all 5 alive is only way to guarantee getting any mask at all but bot survival is nothing to do with rarity.
---
Well, actually it's pretty simple logic. Let's use a drinking cup for example. Say I complain about a drinking cup I bought that I don't like. I say "hey cup company. Shitty cup. Tastes shitty." The next logical step for me is to stop using that cup. They aren't the only cup company around and there are many other cups I could spend my time on. Just saying. If you don't like the game stop spending all your time on it and do something else with your time that you can enjoy.
---
Legendary Drill! you can’t even scrap It for screws.. 🤦‍♂️
---
Not necessarily... not necessarily...
---
That would be fine too.  
---
You on pc? I ran into somebody wearing this yesterday on Fasnacht 
---
I got 4 characters to get these items for. Lol
---
Fortunately I don't want a complete set for each, just for my main. I do want an owl for each, only one hasn't one, otherwise I at least need old man winter effigy for my main, which sucks because it doesn't but my secondary does. 
---
It would suck for some people, but it would be more healthy for the mode overall.  
---
&gt;And you're completely missing the point.
---
*You're* completely missing the point. What will your "reset" change a month from now? Abso-fucking-lutely *nothing*, that's what. All you're doing is fucking players out of what they've earned thus far.
---
&gt;Allowing free migration between easy mode and survival mode defeats the purpose of having survival mode.
---
How? Because you don't get to have a bunch of easy-to-kill newbie players?
---
That's the only reason I can see for this "reset" - Some of you know the best grinding spots and the best tactics to grind your character out quick and get amazing gear quickly, and just want a bunch of easy PvP targets.
---
You should be able to see right off the bat, flat on it's face, how this "reset" will fix absolutely nothing two weeks from now. It's as clear as daylight. Why you aren't understanding this, I don't know.
---
Maybe we are both confused, because I’m on the side of “No Resetting” I don’t have the time to play through another character nor do I want to.
---
I just don’t want leveled gear and stats. I just want the mode to be on a fair level playground.
---
I don’t want OP builds and strats.
---
I just want to be able to survive and defend myself against anyone no matter what level or gear I have.
---
Why? Maybe I want to harass high level characters as a low level pipe gun weilding raider? How am I gonna do that with match making? No I want it to be as random as possible. 
---
Now I don't know if you're stealthy in the bushes aiming at my head, or on a different server and wishing I'll be dead
---
Since when do x-01 mods appear anywhere except modus?
---
stacks of duped gear is the key they left 1 of each item on the characters so if someone had 50 tse handmades they now only have 1 god roll weapon and of course anyone handed a copy still has 1 of that weapon so instead of a million copied super weapons there is just a few thousand 
---
I didn't appreciate his tone, so I dealt with him how I felt appropriate.
---
Go wag your finger at someone else, or maybe find some other way to feel morally superior to others that doesn't involve bothering me.
---
Tell me about it. Can’t even let us look cool in game? Yeesh. 
---
Oh yeah, I crave the challenge. I won’t have all the crazy gear as you. But I want sweaty palms as i adventure through the wasteland. And I can still get a nice VATS crit off on you if you happen to not suspect me.
---
Still just 24 players per server, no map markers expect for wanted players and the top 3 longest lives. It all sounds well laid out for tough but fair high stakes tense fallout. Expect for the ability to go back to easy mode. 
---
I'm implying it is very odd how two people can have polar opposites experiences. Particularly with servers since we are all connecting to the same place. 
---
&gt; There ~~are~~ *were* people who have 100,000 bulk resources, until Bethesda deleted their stacks of items and banned them.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Again, what you want is a broken band-aid of a fix for a problem that doesn't exist, and will just fuck people over for no reason.
---
Because Bethesda dropped the ball so hard with this game that it’s essentially turned into a meme to anybody who isn’t a fan of it. Sure, some criticisms of the game are unfounded. However, many criticisms are justified and based on real grievances people experience while playing this game. The bugginess, crashes, server disconnects, etc. While I may not like that people criticise it. It’s a good thing the game flopped in general, so Bethesda never released an unfinished product again.
---
&gt;  If someone else has bugs that you don't, it must be their fault?
---
Absolutely.  It proves that you are being punished by the RNG.  If you are being punished you must be guilty.  Burn in RNG hell, sinner.
---
You mean I can haz squirrel?
---
&gt;I’m on the side of “No Resetting” I don’t have the time to play through another character nor do I want to.
---
If we're in agreement, then I have no idea why you want me to "change your mind".
---
&gt;In the example of ARK, there are lots of assets you could farm, use to your advantage, and loose if fight goes bad. In Fallout there is nothing similar that could be lost. A god-roll gun is infinitely harder to replace than a dino. You can't craft to replace your losses if you lost your armor in Fallout.
---
Oh so not true because not all dinos are created equal. I have spent on my own private server I share with my wife 8 hours so far looking for a decent level Tapjara to tame. Of that 8 hours I have only found 2 and both were sub level 20 before taming.  And while it can vary on private servers on offical servers it can take up to 4 hours to tame a high level T rex.  And that isn't even getting into breeding for best stats which can take weeks to get a perfect stat dino. 
---
Because trust me your level 50 Rex won't mean jack shit against their 150 perfect stat Rex. Equally when you die you drop everything and while you can learn the engrams  to build basic weapons, armor and saddles.  The higher level versions are only in plans that you find randomly in the game.  
---
I've got a good 200 hours in current PvE Ragnarock server with wife and I've still yet to find any plans for improved metal pick/hatchet.  
---
Because you need these blue prints they can be lost if another team raids your base and takes them or destroys them and they despawn from the world map.  So while I can make Primitive Long Neck Rifle (100% damage) at any time I am reliant on the blue print to make my Ascended Long Neck Rifle (300% damage). And if I were to lose that blue print then I would have to randomly find another one. 
---
And this is some what over simplifying what can happen and how it happens in Ark on a PvP server. Because particularly on official servers you can literally log in and find yourself naked on the beach with literally everything you have ever build or touched completely destroyed or taken. Basically starting over from scratch all over again. Unoffical servers often have offline raid protection active but that doesn't stop them from curb stomping you while you are online.  So you just get to watch as the herd of Stegos tank your auto turrets while they RPG your metal walls until breached allowing their offensive dinos into the base to slaughter all you own. 
---
&gt; I must admit that my perspective is skewed to certain worldview and  playstyle, aka, "this is Fallout and I'm a badass, I'm only playing on  survival servers so I can always shoot rude players at will". I'm  disinterested in adventure because of lack of the tension from not  knowing if player encounter will go ugly. 
---
Yea that is the point of the PvP focused survival mode. To play the game without knowing if and when another player will attack you for what ever reason. Allowing  character transfers completely bypasses that because you can just advance in the game were you are safe then go over to the PvP mode to just kill other players for shits and giggles.  All it will make the PvP focused survival mode is the world's shittiest battle royal mode that will only help feed trolls because they can spend time in peace building up supplies. Then jump into PvP world to grief and troll other players without a car in the world. Because when their supplies run low they just jump back to the safer mode to rebuild supplies. 
---
&gt; Solution that would satisfy both our concerns would be to separate  servers but allow one-way transfer of existing characters. I am afraid  it'd create as many problems as it would solve tho. 
---
Or just don't allow any transfer and require players to start from scratch on the PvP focused server.  This isn't a new concept when Jagex released both Old School Runescape and the short lived entirely PvP focused DarkScape they out right refused character transfers from RS3 into those games. Specifically because people could easily grind out money and items and levels in a quicker (compared to OSRS) or safer (compared to DS) then in their respective game versions.  Which would unbalance and undermine the entire point of those game versions existing in the first place. 
---
Ok cool, I'm essentially telling you to grow up. You accused someone of being a child then acted super childish. 
---
I'll stop wagging my finger when it doesn't seem like I'm telling a 5-year-old, that some people are not very nice. 
---
Level difference first, legendaries second
---
But, if players on servers are divided by levels for example 1-15 / 15-25 / 25-35 / 35-49 / 50-above; legendaries wouldn't be that big of a problem. Even bigger problem then would be how people can do their trading in stations or complete quests that require terminals etc
---
Legendaries with old characters will be 100% griefer heaven
---
Mine is Henny, but I’m almost shocked when someone actually says that instead of Henry. I hear Henry all the time. 
---
&gt;2. r/Fallout: Don't ever go there. It's a cesspool of hate towards anything which is a) not turn-based combat in 2d or b) not from Obsidian
---
Lol So fucking true if you ever want to have some fun there just create a new user name and post asking if you should buy FO76 lmao so much salt.
---
And they Pinned a post reminding everone that Outer Worlds in not related to Fallout. Seriously that's how bad it is they assume Obsidian created a Fallout spin off and called it Outer Worlds.
---
And AGAIN...
---
Everybody been on a level playing field doesn't exclusively relate to their load out.
---
Increased difficulty will make it harder to obtain those load outs and increased loss of equipment during PVP will make retaining a superior position much harder than adventure mode. That is a big chunk of where the playing field will get levelled. The mode is supposed to be more difficult, if the thought of getting killed by stronger players than doesn't entice you to play then why play at all?
---
By allowing for unlimited migration there will be pretty much no point to switching between modes. They are both the exact same game except one is supposed to have increased difficulty. If both modes crossover then there is no increased difficulty. Players will farm in adventure mode and use survival mode purely for PVP when they are rigged resulting in 'survival mode' becoming deathmatch mode. 
---
I’d like to buy 3. 
---
Survival(PVP) isn't for everyone, you need to choose to take part in it (by choosing that game mode), you can still play the regular game, maybe with less pvp oriented people that might go to survival.
---
Workshops sadly(?) are a pvp area by default and since people can see your name on the map as being on control of one you can become a big target for people interested in pvp(since they know they can enable pvp by attempting to take over your workshop)
---
Yeah that's what made me notice, the text at the bottom of the fermenter. It's gonna be a display shelf with the sane characteristics, isn't it?
---
I'll be there, personally can't wait, feels time has come to a stop. 
---
Downvoted for the truth. 
---
What a sad world we live in. 
---
Sure, putting it in survival would make sense.
---
But putting it in the main game would kill it.  People already complain about swapping, so making that harder would drive droves away.
---
The whole system is odd anyway...  I can learn skills, but have to remove (forget?) other skills to use them?  Who forgets their chemistry skills when they are hacking?  Who forgets their shotgun skills when sniping with a hunting gun?
---
So I could see adding limits on another server class of Survivor (heck, go harder core and have no swapping... pick a card and stick with it for life).
---
I would prefer presets to cards in the main tho...
---
&gt;Ok cool, I'm essentially telling you to grow up.
---
...And your input is neither wanted or useful.
---
&gt;I'll stop wagging my finger when it doesn't seem like I'm telling a 5-year-old, that some people are not very nice. 
---
No, you'll get that finger the fuck out of my face and stop wagging it *now*.
---
Go find someone else to annoy, you waste of perfectly good oxygen.
---
If your running one gun army it should stagger them decently as long as your spread is tight enough to hit them constantly 
---
The game doesn't let you shoot through walls. As soon as you walk through a door way, you're dead. 
---
I don’t play Battle Royale games because I don’t enjoy having my progress reset every match and season, if this style of reset came to FO it goes against what I enjoy most about these games - long term character progression. While your suggestion is good for this character transfer discussion it’s still only a short term fix and doesn’t fit in with the character progression design of this game in my opinion.
---
Yep, you can launch yourself, it can be a little tricky solo, but I did it. It would be much easier ro do it with a friend
---
Then avoid that event.
---
Missed that
---
How about instead of being mad that other people get to keep the gear and stats they've worked so hard for, you go grind in Adventure until you're comfortable enough that you feel you can compete?
---
&gt;Why would anyone risk levelling in survival when it offers the exact same experience as adventure except you are at risk of losing more gear? 
---
More experience gain and the better items that will be dropped in Survival, that's what.
---
Cool - server hopping was probably the best decision then! I had this fantasy of heroically taking them all on, but it would have ended badly... 
---
Well, from the fingertips of a former 'Door-Blocking-One-Shotting-Base-Busting-PVPing Player,' I'd like to share some insight on what the OP has voiced his frustrations on, and what will probably only get worse:
---
A lot of melee builds have been one shotting since I can remember. I've even killed people this way, myself, when I was big into pvping. Besides simple "one shotting," there is another way to kill unproced players with things like the sacrificial machete mod and mole miner gauntlet. You just have to create a dot (damage over time), and be able to keep hitting them. Some people are stupid enough to stand there watching you beat them over and over and not use a stimpak. Then they cry about it afterwards. Use a stim, fast travel, or run! Duh!
---
I don't bother with it anymore because it just got boring and I got tired of the drama and back stabbing that happens in some of the pvp cliques out there. When you can farm fog crawlers and buy fiber optics bulk and then farm a blast zone, you can make a substantial amount of orbital strike beacons. Toss 5 to 10 of them in rapid succession and they used to blow a camp clean off the map before the owner could log out. I never understood why people didn't store their decontamination showers in their camp's storage and only take it out when they needed it. Protip: Store your decon arch in your camp storage and only place it when you need to use it. Leaving it out is asking for a mob or player to destroy it. But I hardly ever do base busting anymore unless someone just really pisses me off, talks shit, or harasses one of my pve friends. 
---
But, OP melee builds have been around for a very, very long time. They got rid of stacking some buffs like bobble heads only to replace them with nuka shine. A 'real' troll doesn't care about blacking out and being randomly teleported into a blast zone with three scorch beasts. They only care about one thing: Terror. They will go so far out of their way as to solo a silo and launch a nuke on someone or somewhere. They pass almost all of their caps off to a friend so they lose nothing if they are killed, and they store their junk so you get no goodies either. They have nothing to lose. 
---
Currently, Helvetica and Morgantown are the targets of these kinds of attacks. A long time ago, me and a friend took the Munitions Factory away from a troll and kicked his ass every time he sought revenge. He launched a nuke centered on the factory just to make a statement of how mad he was that he got trolled by a former troll. We took tons of pics. Never been recognized like that before in a game. To have a weapon of mass destruction launched at my own feet. I had to talk my friends out of melting down all the gold scrap and building a golden idol in my resemblance. But those days are over, for now. I just mostly pve and trade stuff.

So there you have it. The view from a troll's eyes and how far they will go to irritate you. Don't react or use voice chat to confront them or complain. They feed off that. Goto another vendor if you can at the first sign of trouble. Block them and hop servers to avoid them. Be aware that they may have spotters on your server or other servers looking for you if they found you especially appealing. Make sure pacifist mode is always on and carry stealth boys that you randomly find on you or have one installed in your PA or use chameleon. It can buy you enough time to fast travel away. Never goto your base right after you've been trolled. It's what a lot of players do and it just leads to a base's demise. Yeah it sucks you might have to do all of this, but you already have experienced the alternative. Hope this helps.
---
Why would you need that much protection in PVE? I ran with simple assassin set and there is no monster that I see as "threat"
---
i told you, if you leave your GODDAMN DISHES IN THE SINK ONE MORE TIME IM GONNA....  
---
\*joe pesci grin. goes looking for the only pen in the vault\*
---
Agree. But it don't means that you have to create a new character for Survival. Just don't allow Adventure items in Survival mode. I've added the post about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3wcsp/survival\_the\_same\_characters\_but\_empty\_inventories/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3wcsp/survival_the_same_characters_but_empty_inventories/?sort=new)
---
I have assassin only. I don't even want to build sentinel, that set is just stupid. In theory I am gonna just ignore players with sentinel, walk away or increase space and if they follow, shoot then. Sound logical in theory, but probably wont work in practice.
---
Sadly tho only other set option to build is cavalry. 
---
Not everyone that has monster mask duped it or even got it from a duper.
---
I simply still had the mask on my head after I relogged after a blue screen crash on PS4 while doing the event.
---
I’ve had it since the 3rd day the game was live too. Even submitted a bug report about it.
---
Same tactic from Sword Art Online, the ol bait and switch. 
---
You’re going to play survival, but leave the world you’re in, join Adventure and fast travel to where you want to go and then log back into survival? You’ll appear on a new server. Sounds like a lot of hassle for no reason. You can pretty much sprint to anywhere on the map at any lvl with only minimal enemy encounters. 
---
How? You're just delaying characters from getting where they are now in that mode. After a week there will be characters that are OP in that mode just like we have today. It doesn't take that long to build an option character like that.
---
Youtubers are in the business to make money only; not to actually add anything beneficial to the universe; not to actually give information.
---
If they could get views by twisting something inside out and saying its something else, then they will in a heartbeat.
---
At least Journalists have some type of code/creed.  Youtubers have none.
---
God you're such a nob end on your high horse - Absolutely pointless conversing with you because you can't see beyond your own tiny little viewpoint. I literally just it out for you and you ignored that part of my post.
---
 I hope you get absolutely rekt in survival because I can tell you are a proper squeaker. G'day.
---
I think they should stay seperate characters it's not an even playing field with these 500 to 1000 lvl characters being able to transfer over 
---
Most of them only got this high from using exploits early in the game and as this is a new world to play on it should be new everything and what you earn in one world stays in that world for me that adds a lot more playability to the game
---
I'm not worried about players who legitimately spend hours to build up a new overpowered character that's just the game and completely fair that they get the power they earn
---
Please Bethesda rethink the option to transfer characters between worlds and let's make a even playing field on this new and exciting world
---
With ARK I'm no expert as I picked it up and dropped it very early. With Runescape I also dropped before DS was created, but in that game the loot drop mechanic was cool as most of the PvP-viable gear was stockable by experienced players. You could stock rune or dragon scimitars in RS. You can't stock quad explosive harpoons here. That changes the relationship between the characters and their loot into direction I dislike, but here we are. There's no raid protection here as you can't raid anybodys land. Different games, different game designs.
---
I am absolutely not against limiting jumping between modes back and forth. I am absolutely against disallowing migration of current characters onto survival servers as an uneducated attempt to level the playing field.
---
Thanks! Usually my cries for help go unnoticed! 
---
&gt;I hope you get absolutely rekt in survival because I can tell you are a proper squeaker. G'day.
---
Yes, yes, go throw your temper tantrum elsewhere.
---
Ok, I thought what TikionFleek was implying was that your stat could be increased endlessly as you leveled up.
---
&gt; But I CAN NOT support this because that also means people with multiple accounts would be the voice for the majority
---
I mean, it's not a true democracy. If someone spent the money to buy the game four times, they're four times as invested as I am and I'm sort of okay with them having four votes on the direction of the game.
---
15 str and unyielding armor w/deep pockets gives you a massive carry boost. Without perks, mutations or chems on low hp  I'm good for near 400lbs.
---
;'-)
---
I know the feeling. 😂😭 But trust me. Unless you have sentinel/assassin armour and a bloodied explosive or anti armour explosive weapon, you’ll get massacred.
---
Welp, time to annoy the wife.
---
By what you wrote I strongly suspect that even if you don't have the gear to faceroll me you have the wits to take me down and to farm caps on people geared as I am.
---
perhaps it's an easter egg 😂 !
---
Yeah for me it’s not a game killer or anything I’m not going to be like DONT PLAY, I’ll just end up approaching how I’ll play differently plus it’s a beta so it’s subject to change 
---
May I ask how you got there?
---
💖💖💖😘
---
Wouldn’t take too many lines of code or much resources. The things are already in the game and would just require a system to filter the votes 
---
Well thats the thing isnt it? It's been months are theyre still going on. I saw a post about Fasnacht on r/gaming about finding the sun mask and how rare it was and non of the comments knew what the person was talking about (showing that they dont play it anymore) and hating on it like they did 3 months ago. Like, move on lol
---
How many TD did it take to get there?
---
I dont think even half the people playing FO76 goes to Reddit.   So, I would not rely on reddit stats.    People posting stats on reddit on their personal experience is fine for a individual view but not on a collective.   Compile several of these metrics together from 20-30 people and you may have accurate rates.
---
No problem man. I wish we could collect them, but oh well.
---
Gotta keep those savages out. ^and the dead people too^
---
&gt;Adrenal Reaction’s damage increase tops out at 20% health now and they shaved 15% damage off the top of Adrenal’s max damage bonus. Hope that helps!
---
Seems it was answered. Not sure what else you're looking for. Though I wish they were this conservative with the TSE nerfs
---
I try to do the exact same thing. I keep all my known plans and once I get enough. I find someone who is low level and I’ll quick travel to them and drop a bunch of them. 
---
It's still in the game, you can use it in workshops
---
I disagree. If I was able to get the rare ones I'd wear it. I really like how they look so I'd rock them
---
happened to me too... Saw the misc quest: Get supply Pod.. and then boom, wanted...
---
&gt;I'm sure that if it bothers them that much that they want it to cease, they'll let us know.
---
HA HA HA HA 
---
If anyone at Bethesda said anything even slightly negative to any player, it would cause such a PR nightmare. 
---
That's happened a few times for game companies and they got slammed.
---
A lot of gamers are so over entitled.
---
But to derail any post thats someone having fun all this time after release just seems unnecessary 
---
Yeah, it’s really annoying how effective it is. That’s why I don’t even bother when I see a wanted players with level 200+ people around them. Lol
---
I hope they will release some kind of big AoE 2dmg per second acidic smoke grenade that damages you even in PA so that you'd have a reliable method of killing AFK glitched leaders.
---
Yes but it wasn't an answer from bethesda was it, and I can't get a reply from them. 
---
I mean I never wanted to say I was wagging my finger anyway. You just seemed to like saying it that's all.
---
You know it's not real too? It's not a real finger being wagged.
---
Didn't mean to annoy was just calling you out for calling someone a child by acting like one. You're really helping prove my point though.
---
I'll go on my way, I recognise this is an Internet argument and doesn't really make a difference to life. Hence why haven't bothered with calling anyone wastes of oxygen or anything. (Good one by the way, how did you think that one up with all your responsibilities?)
---
Have a good rest of your day! I hope no one accidentally "Wags" a finger near you in real life. 
---
They definitely are. I stopped grinding because of so many just ending up being by myself or only having 1 or 2 people helping. The events not hard it's just near impossible with so many suiciders, especially for a melee build like mine.
---
I agree. I don't read those posts anymore.
---
The hilarious part, people will STILL be telling Bethesda how to do things the day before an update, as if they have time to make changes. 
---
Because its only a shadow of what it could have been. Moreover lots of lies about the game were told upfront by Bethesda. The game came out and was broken already. Then the patches removed everything that was still fun in the game. As a result a lot of people left the game (myself included). The endgame is a complete mess etc.
---
But instead on first fixing the game, rebalancing it properly more content is now incoming. Try to build a house on a broken foundation and you will see the result. 
---
Are you so salty that you feel the need to insult not only the guy that was simply using a feature of the game, but also all PvPers?
---
I like that LMG but man it goes through .308 ammo. Expensive AF to operate.
---
maybe a better idea ?  give us a load out option.   this is what cards I need to go out and play, this is what I need in camp, this is what..............................
---
load out 1 please
---
There's a spot in Morgantown where you can get 2 party hats off of a couple of skeletons. I plan on selling Vault Tec gear so I grab them whenever I'm around. I have like 15. 
---
The skeletons are sitting right on the entering Morgantown sign. 
---
Pacifist works also you can troll Wanted players swing at then a few times throw out a ???? Emote let them respond with emotes then take off pacifist and kill them. I did this last night to a bait player for a PvP trap team lol.
---
How?
---
Grow up 😊
---
The Reapomders Medic Overall, or whatever the name was. If you google the Reaponders Fireman Uniform you migjt find my post where I explain my efforts in detail.
---
Gotcha! Yeah they don't like admitting to stealth nerfs they know they'll get hateful feedback
---
Thanks for the tips
---
No my dear it will only get worse. Especially with the broken mess of and endgame. So enjoy until you are there.
---
Very true, unfortunately. 
---
I think those kinds of weapons lost the Explosive prefix a few patches ago.
---
Go to hell. 🔥
---
so true. Bethesda made sure to effectively kill the rifle builds.
---
But they dont care about that detail they are just trolling and jumping down peoples throats for having fun
---
I just don’t understand why the folks who bought and hated are asking the folks who play if they should.
---
Do or don’t play, But please STOP  asking me if you’re gonna enjoy. I don’t have a say in your happiness. 🤦‍♂️
---
To be honest I really wonder how this survival system will work out. There is to many if’s and but’s at this moment. I understand that grinding new character maybe time taking, boring when going through same content again but in this same time having an advantage of high lvl character its not really fair. It makes me wonder really how did they balance this mode.
---
Ill bet most peoples will try to either hide camps somewhere, so one cant find it, or they will just keep to workshop stations and bed only, so they dont have to spend resources on constant repairs. Stealth gameplay will be the most advantegous way of fight, either range or melee. I guess range stealth vats will be on top of the list. I would assume they will remove player markers from the map. Not having fast travel maybe tricky. That would make people move there camps more often, depends on character progression, so I imagine by the max level qll players would be stacking camps in high lvl area prompt to legie grind etc. Unless of course grind areas would become mass murder scenes. Imagine all players at whitesprings lol. To many questions at this moment. Lets wait and see what will they release upon the appalachia.
---
If they finally balance PvP so it's not a hide and seek - one shot everyone nonsense, I'm in for sure.
---
Those will be exceptions, not the normal.   Fallout 76 is not really a game that makes it hard to get End-game items.  It makes it hard to get "perfect" end game items, sure.  But many other MMO make loot-walls you have to climb to get to the item you want.   Raids, farming, buying, ect.    Those are the type of games that will attract the majority of the gold-sellers.
---
You wont see the amount or mass of TSE and high end armors rampant in the PVP system that you see right now in the main game.  If the duping has stopped.  Based on percentages and drop rates alone, thats impossible.   One or two might be dedicated enough to get a TSE, but thats 700+ hours later!  Many people playing this game dont have TSE like myself and I have 240+ hours into it.  Some have over 700 and no TSE.   Duping shortcutted all those hours on a massive population.   
---
Well first finish the game and check that endgame content. If you then still believe its an amazing game then enjoy it :)
---
Clothes can be found in two categories: Outfits and underarmor.
---
Outfits always show up overtop your armour and rarely, if ever, come with stat bonuses.
---
Underarmour sits underneath your outfits and armour and can be upgraded to give stat bonuses like rad resist and various special bonuses based on the faction it belongs to.
---
I never thought of that. Cav is then useless when firing a weapon.  So then a person standing still with sentinel armorhas the advantage over someone running at you. Do I get that right?
---
These posts are literally just people crying because they’re gonna get murked. Some people have poured hours into their main character, what the fuck makes you think everyone wants to level again. And let me tell you even with 20% more it’s still gonna be tedious.
---
Or let us make cooking oil from corn. 
---
Look... I've had to deal with my inbox being slammed, and unlike a few others you've been mostly respectful throughout this discourse, so how about we both just agree that we aren't going to agree on this?
---
The first time I saw this bug it reminded me of the ghost gate in Morrowind. It is a weird one.

To be fair buying gear can be some people’s only way of getting it without farming for thousands of caps for a single piece of armor 
---
I hear you there. How you get "Raiders" after your username? 
---
Oh you can absolutely stock a quad explosive harpoon if you trade with other players for multiple versions. Just like you can either grind out Armadyl God War Dungeon boss to get a rare chance of getting the Armadyl God Sword parts. Or you could trade with another player for that weapon at the cost of several hundred million coins depending on how far back you want to go in RS's history.  There are absolutely players who can afford to bring Semsic wand/Orb into PvP and unless the highest level spells damage in game given them a clear advantage over people using cheaper easier to replace items like Staff of Light. PvP needs to be balanced but that doesn't mean it is fair.
---
&gt; There's no raid protection here as you can't raid anybodys land. Different games, different game designs. 
---
When you log off your CAMP despawns from the game world. In Ark your buildings are permanent in the game world.  On Ark I can build a small base and go on vacation for 2 weeks. During that time the base will exist as long as that server exists unless someone or something destroys it.  Theoretically I could build a small 1 foundation square building and not play for a year and come back and the building would still be there.  
---
Mean while on 76 standing in my wife's CAMP as soon as she leaves about 30 seconds later her entire camp despawns around me and I drop one story to the ground. 
---
&gt;  I am absolutely against disallowing migration of current characters  onto survival servers as an uneducated attempt to level the playing  field. 
---
And yet it would level the playing field. You seem to be confusing leveling the playing field with everyone having the same success.
---
I am an illustrator for a living. I deal with people who tell me they can't even draw a stick person, but at the same time, want to tell me how I should draw and what I should draw, and how I should do things. 
---
I also work in Sci Fi/Fantasy publishing and it's ten times worse there. It always amazes me how people that never ever do anything think it's ok to bull creators with their ideas and demands. 
---
Using a feature of the game ? So, being an asshole is a feature ? Woah, i discover a lots of new things everyday.
---
That dude made me waste a NukeZone, "Just because i kept going back". I'm sorry Boss, i didn't knew that PvPers can claim an entire game. Sorry for wasting space in your zone ! 
---
How rude of me, wasting oxigen in your game, enjoing a game instead of being a douche.
---
I agree, people keep complaining it doesn't do rpg well or isn't very faithful to the Fallout core. Yet choosing utility or qol perks over straight damage is exactly the kind of choices you would expect of a Fallout game.
---
I'd limit perk changing to being near a stashbox or in your camp. 
---
Just sit back and enjoy kill everything you can, super mutants give good xp. Clear out low lvl areas like wade airport, tons of junk and a power armor spawn there as well. Sleep alot for the xp bonus.
---
Then you must not have played the survival mode on FO4, it forces you to eat/drive, get diseases, sleep and no fast travel.  FO76 is a very light version of that.
---
They made the drop rates of legendaries so rare it’s near impossible to do it any other way without getting someone else’s 
---
I'm on mobile, so I don't know about the desktop app. But here, simply go to the sub's main page, and on the top right there will be 3 dots. Click there, and one option should be something like "change flair".
---
I play on pc and rarely see griefers. Maybe console gamers have it worse. In fact i bet they do
---
Wait, you want Atoms for getting rid of something you don't want?  
---
I dont beleive that either. Its more the management way of thinking of how they can milk the most cash out of the game before kicking it to the trash. I therefore honestly dont think it will be fixed like ever.
---
Yea they did but I have one from pre patch
---
Was it because of the challenge of being naked, drunk and high on chems? /s
---
PvP is a feature of the game, is it not? No matter how much you despise it.
---
You are being stupid, again. If instead of crying you would have searched for solutions, you would have realized that there's this thing called "pacifist mode" since the game came out, that prevents you from damaging other players on accident.
---
Now it's your turn; learn, or keep crying.
---
Ah yes, Dodgy could be more descriptive.
---
Thanks to your post, I now have a good idea of the build you are talking about and who the author might be.  So I retract my comment of it being BS.
---
However, the way you worded it before, made it sound like you were somehow using pure DR/ER to reach an effective 60% of full Assassin/Sentinel, which isn't possible, not without certain perks as well.  And it's really nothing that special(IMO).  Just a 2.0 of a previous attempt(or maybe this would be the 3.0, oh well).  I also know the weaknesses to that build, but depending on your leg and torso mods, 2 of them won't really matter.  The 3rd one is rare, and risky(also works against Assassin/Sentinel builds too).  I guess there's a fourth one, in the same camp as the 3rd, but I've never seen anyone use the weapon that way, so I doubt it'll be an issue unless people run it purely as a counter to the build.
---
This is your best yet but really bro tame a scorchbeast already(jk doubt its possible, )
---
imagine one of those above your camp in flatwoods tho !
---
If the drop rate is less an 1%, it could be 0.01% meaning you have to run the event 1000 times to get guarantee of it dropping.
---
I like the fact they are actually rare.  Not everyone on the server with one.    TSE is supposed to be so very rare as well, now everyone has one it seems.  They are nothing special.
---
The masks need to remain special, only those few who got them.    Don't increase drop rate.
---
I bet rich people actually do this, #conspiracymoos
---
That logic should have been applied to the overpowered guns then. If you don't want them killing events with crowds then avoid those events. Why deal with lopsided damage mechanics when you can just tell players to avoid events. I can't wait to see what happens on the PvP servers when the death claw people are using chameleon armor to be invisible and killing anyone that walks by them with one shot. Lol
---
60    and not alone any more, theres  loads         ps4
---
Maybe simply they should remove all legendary gear and make all the power armours really hard to obtain. That would be a real survival. 
---
No , I only got the one character 
---
Look closer. The models are very different. They're made to look similar to indicate a lineage between the two.
---
Seems fair.  Not trying to be a troll or anything.   
---
Well i didnt say people would need to level again, thats the exact opposite of what i said.
---
yeah, great, and then server hop until you find one where your faction is leading.
---
this community is ...
---
I want that Lever, think it's called Sole Survivor... I think. 
---
Yea I just dump all my shit and leave! And also, I wonder what the chances of all items that people sell actually showing up after being sold. I know when I sell them 12 things, only like 2 of them show back up to buy. But I’m curious if other players can see them all?
---
I don't believe that either 
---
They are sellong them allright, but are people actually buying them en mass
---
I will, I already have two level 90 characters, but neither is well build for PVP. I was thinking a vats rifle user.
---
What I'm hoping is that they use terminals to allow you to change target types (animals, scorched, human, etc)
---
No because a level 60 could have a better build than a 150
---
You’re welcome! Thanks for the help! 
---
OR you could just lvl your character..lolz
---
XB1
---
You own a workshop? 
---
I get your point, but don’t forget, a level 50 can do the same damage and has no worse stats than a level 5000. 
---
That 20 people across all platforms only represents the people that also participate in this reddit, which I venture is a comparatively tiny subset of all players.
---
  To that end, theres likely a lot more (of all variants of the) masks out there, just noone knows b/c the holders of same are not participating here.
---
Let’s just agree to disagree. Even if it is a “band-aid”; transferring characters will euthanize the game mode before it even begins. And that’s why this post has 2k upvotes and your’s has 3.
---
You don’t need any charisma if you have a teammate share animal friend with you :) and there is a LOT of tameable things, right now I have a snallygaster (animal friend 3 &amp; wasteland Whisperer 3 to tame for some reason) and my friend got a rabbit yesterday. You can get scorched versions of pretty much anything that spawns, they are just more rare like the wolf, dog, and cat but all scorched pets seem to be aggro af haha :) 
---
Oxhorn would love that lmao
---
Because OP guns can do it from long distances. Chameleon people are not invisible if you pay attention.  I've shot several just to fucking warn them and they walked away. No idea if they intended to fight or they were just AFK while invisible. 
---
yeah me too
---
I've got a level 20-something alt that I don't play very much.  Will probably use that to check Survival out
---
What platform? 
---
This right here. Not everyone plays the game to be the world's biggest badass. That drop rate is bad enough on dailies ( when they work! ) but on a temporary event?
---
I know, system isn't perfect, I think it would help the most for people under 50 actually
---
Yes like in fallout 4! You could craft in that game. maybe whoever was making the recipe got his games mixed up
---
Because if I take a laser rifle, I can put automatic barrel and a round thing at the end of it, but my legendary laser pistol as short/long barrel only, and no round thing
---
The only reason why fresh start will level the playing field is because all duped, bought, cheated stuff is gone. I think this is a valid argument because it isnt about efford or skills. Easy to fix that feeling of inequality though. What it would take is  new and stronger gear (strategic or def/att) or even just higher level gear being implemented so everyone has to work for it himself. 
---
Im sure they find a  reasonable solution given the choices they made in the last few months
---
As a long time player myself, I'd say it's usually 1v1 and the third is just usually showing up from time to time 
---
Agreed but I think that some filtering is better than none. Also this is more to try creating the low lvl game that some people are wanting.
---
You dress the same way I do! Minus the patrolman sunnies.
---
Just hop. Even if you kill them they'll just seek revenge and you're stuck in infinite pvp limbo until one of you decides to quit and it won't be them.
---
I doubt the shops would be there if there wasn't a market for it. I also doubt the sales figures would be easily found.
---
Look like a marked man
---
Oups, my fault, just forget that there 3 platform, PC :)
---
so you seriously believe Bethesda will fix Fallout 76?
---
I see what you're saying, but the best solution to this in the LONG term is to allow characters to swap back and fourth.  That way, they can put 300 hours into the game  in the new ultra safe adventure mode (where your camp cant even be destroyed anymore) and gear up.  
---
Secondly, even if you were a brand new level 1, I'm just saying, you probably WONT be getting killed all the time, because you will probably be scared shittless and running away and avoiding people.  And avoiding people, will be very easy IMHO.
---
Lastly, they mentinoed already that they are making changes to how damage works, though they were vague.  SO we really do just need to wait and see.
---
But this is better than a completely fresh start, isn't it?
---
&gt;Let’s just agree to disagree. 
---
I'm perfectly fine with that.
---
&gt;And that’s why this post has 2k upvotes and your’s has 3.
---
Because reddit's hivemind is mid-circlejerk over this? 
---
By that logic, Fallout 76 is the shittiest game ever, it's totally going to bankrupt Bethesda, it will be free to play in a month, and because of this game the Fallout series is forever ruined.
---
People here were saying literally all of that bullshit a few months ago, and all those types of comments were upvoted like crazy. None of those comments were true, of course, but people sure as hell loved upvoting them.
---
It would not because the first few weeks the nolifes would dominate and later we'd be exactly where we are now, but with less players that are fully PvP-prepared.
---
Lack of persistency of what you build and what you take control of is part of the current design of F76. Allowing current characters into survival is aligned with current game design. Disallowing them pointing at examples where the environmental conditions, nature of consequences and the foundations of the game are completely different is not aligned with current game design.
---
Ok
---
Does anybody here have the ability to craft one on xbox?
---
Sorry, I can’t help you. Good luck though! 
---
Just start over in survival. The XP boosts will help you power level. 
---
Yes, the stacks (so they say).  They didn't get rid of the thousands of duped single items that people have kept.  Best rolled legendary item, duped, distributed, kept. If you really can't see the problem then I can't help you.
---
Lmk if you get more. I’ve got caps or trades. PSN VinKramey
---
Good lord I’d kill for a smoke! Haha 
---
Because these masks are garbage. Take the runescape halloween mask, it is valuable not only because they are rare, they also match your sets. Red dragon mask + red trimmed full rune pl8. Man, if this even gave something like hunters hood or something similar, this sh#t would been dope af. 
---
nice!, your stash should be almost full to be able to counter every build, my guess anyway.  
---
where are you getting the "two people" from. i honestly think that there is a majority and a minority while and from my personal experience with this game i can only come to the conclusion that you are in the minority.
---
Bethesda is catering to casual players. They know most people dont want to run a second character. 
---
They wont listen to the bad advice upvoted to the front page. Dont worry.  We we be able to take our charicters into either server. Its been announced.
---
Actually 5. There is a back room in the honey haus 
---
Thx anyway for your answer :)
---
I had a similar experience while not participating in the enclave quests when passing through lewis burg and harpers. 
---
So you agree starting from scratch isn’t a huge setback, if it will only take a week for players to grind?
---
The current drop rate compared to the proposed changes is like 5000 caps value to 500, 500 being that they change it so theyre more common. I know the common masks have like a base value of 10 caps but i just sold my orange nuka jacket for 250 so caps are subjective byt either way make it so i can get dat goblin!
---
I am very glad that I managed to get the message to an educated player without publicly specifying the details. This build indeed has weaknesses, just as any other build, but it also has some widely neglected advantages. Happy testing.
---
Most ideas I read here are actually pretty good and often there wouldn't be much effort to realise them.
---
Look at the mod community and what they are capable of. Then you will see that many improvements are easily done.
---
Fix it? Im already having loads of fun playing it, even with the occasional Bethesda glitch. I try not to get so 'serious' about gaming. Sure, it could have been better, but it still is making me happy
---
Hence create the king of Grenades that can flushed any enemy out of hiding regardless exploding radius or objects. A grenade that have an effect that immediately negates almost all the healing effects. 
---
It’s so good that you don’t need to find hiding enemy anymore. Just throw them around. And they will reveal themselves. 
---
I did not read all the posts , but someone mentioned that players in survival mode should be divided by level rank. 
---
So level 10-20 ,20-30 and so on.
---
Let every level rank start with the same weapons  and caps.  Let them fight for better stuff. 
---
So when you level up you have less disadvantages and you can still battle up in the rankings...  Every player gets a chance to be number one in the ranking. 
---
Don't let high level players beat a low level for easy xp. A high level can not team up with a low level  ,maybe they can team up ,but the high level can not beat a low level. Maybe low levels can team up to beat a high level. That would be interesting.
---
Maybe this way the survival mode will still have a chance to survive. 
---
Im excited to bring the charicter i already built into survival!
---
Dean was one of my favourite characters, the reveal with him and finding out I couldn't save him then was hard. 
---
It’s the same thing, starting with no gear is like leveling, people probably don’t want to invest more time in regearing. If you need stuff go farm adventure and go to survival when you are ready 
---
But can you drop you C.A.M.P there?
---
&gt; They didn't get rid of the thousands of duped single items that people have kept.
---
So? Go buy one of your own on of the various marketplace/trading subreddits instead of insisting that nobody else gets to have theirs. If there's as many of these dupes as you think they are, you should have no problem finding one on the marketplace.
---
The difference isn't going to matter once Survival mode gets better drops. You really think you're going to get the exact same quality of equipment in Adventure as you do in Survival?
---
Like I said, give it a few weeks and there will be tons of players with all that cool gear and more that you're afraid of them having now.
---
This "reset" is a broken band-aid of a fix for a problem that doesn't exist.
---
Any armor with ammo weight reduction will also reduce the weight of fusion cores
---
Yeah, if they didn't incentivize PVE at all.  However, 20% experience boost is huge, and legendary rewards from challenges is also big for many people.   It CANT be battle royale or a gank fest.  Even if it was fortnite, its fortnite where you're invisible to the human eye when you crouch or activate your stealth boy, with underground caves and no wall constantly shrinking.  The whole reason that "collapsing wall" mechanic exists in those battle royale game is because otherwise players would never find each other.  Those who want to pvp will do so, and those that don't will be able to do so also.
---
Remember, if you kill someone, they can put a bounty on you, exposing you on the map.   Killing some noobie and getting 10 caps, means you risk losing 500 caps to a non nooobie who is stealth boying in the woodline with a sniper rifle, waiting for you to move and shoot so that your sentinel or cavalier armor is not active (caviler requires sprinting and sentinal requires your standing and not moving).   
---
They aren't giving us a deathmatch mode.  They are giving us a fallout 76, the way it was meant to be played (IMHO), while also catering to all the people who want a sole pve experience and giving them adventure mode.  PvP will be possible now, but not required, and discouraged by the disadvantages applied to you by the bounty system.
---
This could be sorted by just having a target objective, king of the hill style (like planetside). You have to control the majority of the points for a sum total of 30 mins-1 hour and the first team to do that claims that sector of the map) there could be 5 points. And they're all located about 500m from each other 
---
This also can be the solution, yes. Though personally I prefer to have separate Stashes with possible transfer from Survival to Adventure only.
---
So good that it needs two minutes and five grenades before it does the trick? In a game where two grenades usually can take down anyone and yet they are widely ignored? That's not the king of grenades. Its a weak version of electric smoke grenades seen in other games.
---
May be even without basic entry level supplies :) Thanks for support!
---
Agreed. 
---
There are certain buildings that I think will be used for this. Graham offices (where you get eccavator power armor), some pharmaceutical building in the forest ( where they had cargo boats drop medical supplies), and that one naval listening post ( where 90% of clipboards are in game) all have special "headquaters" that already match up with factions.
---
Definitely, I've worked to hard for my current build to restart it.
---
I only have one character as well, no alts and so on, I'm looking forward to it. ROLL ON 26TH!!!!
---
Make it 5-10 minutes and I would support this. 
---
I like this.  
---
@44, I have unused an packrat 1 and packrat 2 ininventory.  And I have  packrat 3 already equipped.  
---
Strength 15, and because OF wierd draws an not understanding how the perk system worked early on, I have 3 unused points.  
---
At level up time, I can't select new cards in S because it's already maxed, can't use the cards I have because their associated perk is already maxed.
---
So yea, I'd like to turn those unusable cards in for 2 others.
---
I’ve seen folks who leave their crafting table open and available for others to use.
---
I’ll leave stims and purified water if I use.
---
I just turned 29 today. Ha!
---
Oh snap. If you are on Xbox, it's yours. 
---
Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
---
Oh yeah we do not know the actual rates. But they look way down too rare for a limited reward. We have only four days left. 
---
What's the point of this? Most if not all rare masks in the game right now probably come from the Dev Room. People will end up selling them on eBay. That's a good way to fuck up an otherwise great event.
---
If rare masks dropped one out of ten parades they would still be rare, and getting exactly the one you want would take a lot of time. But as it is the drop is so low that you can replay the event over and over for days with no sight of any rare masks. This makes no sense if what they want is to keep people playing the game.
---
Or better, can we configure it to show our choice of which quest to show on compass. Choice to unclutter the compass
---
I appreciate your point of view, but you are begging the question here. Why do you assume that people who don't play a lot are the minority?
---
People keep saying it's an error and I know Bethesda is Bethesda but given the way the parade was rolled out in an intergrated-with-the-world-way and *also* given the *very nature of cryptids* it just makes more sense for it to be purposeful. 
---
"Did you see the x message?" "Did you see the x???" Is the very heart of cryptids and that 's the experience they're to give us (imo)
---
Downvoted lol that was quick
---
Hi Reddit!!!

That's a good idea. Like how you have to make flour powder from razorgrain, water and concrete. 
---
Griefers, like assholes smell.
---
Block his GT, THEN server hop.
---
Probably used PA clipping glitch to get in..
---
there are 20 Ultracite mods - there is no jet pack included though.
---
Secret agent.
---
Dont use dodgy..  Its a trap
---
I agree we need to wait and see what it actually looks like before coming to conclusions but you have to admit being able to take in current characters and gear has a very good chance of being an unbalanced mess.
---
I'm intrigued by this note in the latest communication from them
---
&gt; We’ve made some over-arching adjustments to PVP damage in Survival Mode to make weapons feel even more deadly in your hands, while also limiting the likelihood that another dweller can drop you in one hit. 
---
That suggests some balancing, but it's really vague. It kind of backs up your point though, we need to wait and see. Also this should hopefully be a real Beta unlike the PR stunt we had before so if it is the mess they can change it.
---
They don't need many materials to craft pipe pistols, craft a load then scrap em. 
---
idk about the tesla, but i have an explosive flamer, and i get continuous popcorn explosions inside of the stream of flames. it actually took me a while to realize that it had the exploding prefix.
---
Suppressors are usually from scrapping, not sure if plans exist (mods might).
---
Don't waste caps on Workbench Plans (besides maybe PA), since you get them from early quests.
---
Some plans are level locked, others are random, so just server hop if you can't find the plan you need at a vendor if you're the right level, and some spawn in the world.
---
Pacifist doesn't stop you taking damage (only dealing it), and workshops mark you for PVP (pacifist or not).
---
Cooking oil is a regular spawn by one of the cooking stations(beside one of the wood piles) in Flatwoods, and it often spawns in the kitchen next door.  It spawns frequently in most kitchens, actually.
---
I have 5 characters to deal with my equipment. My main character wears seven different weapons for all types of enemies. The truth is however that high damage vats critshot is currently the most effective solution.
---
38? I would definitely join an old folks group in fo76
---
Have a low level alot. Join server. High level Friend joins me. I log out an join friend with high level alt.
---
2 high levels on a low level server
---
Aster the blue plants give crimson? How.
---
It will be phenomenally harder to get the items a lot of players already have as they start from scratch.  The god rolled duped items that they have kept will also be gone.
---
As for the 24 / 7 player they will still rightly have an advantage for putting so many hours in, good for them but they will still have work to do rather than no work whatsoever.
---
Equal playing field can pretty easily be taken care of like most online games with a system called match making.  You may have heard of it.
---
24 / 7 players that are level 100 within days will be matched with similar levelled players.  Players with a full time job that play for a few hours a night and are level 25 will also be matched with similar levelled players.  Its not a difficult system.  Your weeks from now theory wouldn't need a reset if the oh so obvious matchmaking system was in place.  Of course no life players would be against matchmaking because they would have to pvp against similar levels not farm low level players.  
---
Trust me, if you're thrown in a server with level 150-300 level players and you're getting farmed at level 22 you ain't going to stick around playing the game.
---
Hint: Fusion Cores are also used for Energy Weapons.
---
I got 168 yesterday with green thumb. They nuked barely on prime and to the north there was about 40 that I usually don't get (so 80 extra).
---
Pretty much this. Not our faulth you can't make a proper build for your character. People with those sets are killable in 5-10 shots if you got staggering perks.
---
I'm going to do the event a few times today so I'll look out for those plans (you can have them for free if I get the ones you want) and anything else. I dumped all the spare plans/masks I had at the overseer's camp yesterday.
---
Happy hunting amigo :)  
---
Jesus I hope not, that would really create a shit storm. 
---
&gt;It would not because the first few weeks the nolifes would dominate and later we'd be exactly where we are now, but with less players that are fully PvP-prepared.
---
Yes that is how PvP works. People who just got Over Watch will be beat down by people who have been playing it since launch and have more or less mastered the game.  Why the guy with the Seren Bow beats the shit out of the guy with the Mystic Fire Staff.   
---
Your counter argument is literally the very concept of PvP in any game. But particularly games with progression in them. 
---
&gt; Lack of persistency of what you build and what you take control of is  part of the current design of F76. Allowing current characters into  survival is aligned with current game design. Disallowing them pointing  at examples where the environmental conditions, nature of consequences  and the foundations of the game are completely different is not aligned  with current game design. 
---
Linking the fact your CAMP despawns when you leave because the server can only hold 35 or so players at once thus if everyone's CAMP was permanent you would be forced onto that single server that could on host 35 or so players so you would be forced to wait until that server freed up to play again.  Equally workshops were created with PvP in mind which is why they come with their own stock of supplies so players are not wasting their own junk to build on it unless they really want to.  
---
Camps are suppose to disapear when you log off to make room for the next player that takes your place. Workshops are suppose to be contested and attacked specifically to avoid players capturing one and then logging off for an hour or two to come back and harvest all the resources gained for 0 effort.  
---
None of theses have any connections or justification for the survival mode character transfer.  You made a snide comment about uneducated people making an attempt to level the playing field.  But you are being far more guilty of that then they are in trying to connect the dots between things that do not connect.  
---
The playing field is leveled. Everyone starts out the same. That is a level playing field. You are either accidentally or purposefully confusing a level playing field with making everyone the same.   
---
Got a screenshot of this near Watoga.
---
Managed to get inside mine, but it's the same in all directions.
---
Disappeared on relog though.
---
Thx! 
---
You're basically ignoring the point he made about the legendary vendor and accessibility to good gear in the future.  He already addressed this concern with the following:
---
\-Legendary vendor may make it way easier to gear up with the legendary gear you want/need
---
\-If developers decide to make legendary gear even HARDER to find, will we have to wipe again?
---
\-What about in the long term, say, a year from now, and new players want to play, should we wipe for them as well?
---
As long as it allows other players to reliably kill AFK leaders, its okay for me. The idea of countering healing effects is debatable too, but if we'd skip that damage would have to be higher than the healing output of all the passive in-combat healing effects combined, otherwise they would be useless.
---
Do not skip past all the quests, lore, and story to reach end-game where... there is nothing.
---
This game shines in all the quests and stuff you do to get to end-game.
---
Do not go to whitesprings and farm ghouls either.   Just do quests, explore and have fun with the game.
---
If you are lacking junk, figure out what you need and Tag it.  Then all junk with that tagged component will be uniquely identified.
---
Make sure you break down all junk into components before stashing them.
---
Plus only keep a defined limit of all your junk components stashed.   (i.e. 100 of each, 1000 of steel, 300 of lead, ect).
---
the Excavator Power Armor is very helpful in carrying around all that junk when you do junk runs too.   You need to be level 25 to use it.
---
Other that the above, just pick up everything that isn't and is nailed down.  You should be crawling with overweight within a hour guaranteed!
---
Trying to farm ultracite! What the hell 🤦‍♂️ was I thinking.?
---
Yep because I can definitely catch up to people who glitched there way to level 200+ who has god tier weapon perfected builds and etc.. make sense bud ... 
---
Oh, I guess we missed your Dev tag or something...
---
Yes, but thats not gona change for a while.
---
İnteresting
---
Easily the best mod for the game 
---
And it would have the effect of limiting it to one vote per account.

Indeed
---
Mine will be working for a while yet so I am taking advantage. 
---
Matchmaking.  Almost every online game has it.  Level 250 players get to play against similar levelled players.  Level 10 players also are matched with similar levelled players.  Not a difficult process.
---
Feel free to visit the Mothman Red Room....we can compare notes...
---
As of now there is cross matchmaking between Xbox and ps4 for fortnite. It's not sony or Microsoft preventing this but instead it's bethesda
---
Thx, if you need one that you dont have already, let me know it, if i find it i can spare it for you
---
What'd he say?
---
My only theory is because they want to remove all joy from my life but it's probably not so dire :P
---
Matchmaking is a whole other discussion. As it stands, a few people here just want everyone to not be able to transfer Adventure characters to Survival, and I disagree.
---
If we're going to discuss theoretical fixes to the problem, my own suggestion is having a "Survival+" mode added on, where people can migrate characters between Adventure and Survival, but nobody can migrate a character to Survival+. That way, it sets up the "fresh start" some people want, while not screwing the people that don't.
---
Give us more time if your going to make these items such rare drops. Some of these rare masks are the only ones they want and most people won’t farm enough to get them.
---
Interesting suggestion. I like it. It may be hard to implement however, as it adds some mechanics to the game and not just a readjustment of some numbers. I guess time will tell if something like this is necessary.  We may just be fretting over nothing though,  because for every clever player hiding in a bunker somewhere, there are 23 other clever players on that server thinking of clever ways to flush them out. I'm excited to see how pvp evolves and the tactics and strategies the player base comes up with.
---
Something like I didn’t kill you because you aren’t worth it, I
---
World PvP has always been a major feature of Fallout 76.  It’s your responsibility to use existing options to avoid engaging in PvP, if that’s your desire.
---
Are the game mechanics perfect?  No.  
---
Should you have some accountability?  Yes.
---
Lol
---
I just replied to you in another thread on that same topic. Matchmaking is an entirely different discussion.
---
In combat healing such as?
---
I get this argument 100% but right now people who don’t have the time to get to insanely high level did a glitch to get to that ranking and returning players or new players won’t have a chance to catch up because these glitches doesn’t exist. Second point is not 75% of the community would have god tier weapon it would be a smaller percentage. With forcing a new player base builds would need to be reworked and not be perfected already with amazing gear already to go but instead make people work for it that way new players or returning have a better character. When people are releveling and what not Bethesda can use that time to balance the pvp so it’s more of a fair playing field 
---
It's a little more complex because they don't spoil, there's no condition bar. So a food you can make from collected junk or need to hold onto a workbench for starts to change things. 
---
You have 2 choices, play or don’t play survival. 
---
If the environment has elements you don’t like, ADJUST, ADAPT and OVERCOME.
---
Or 
---
keep griefing lowbies on pve. 
---
Not my problem.
---
Except even running it 1000 times isn't a 100% guarantee off a .01% rate.
---
&gt;jet pack

yup,  jet pack  and stealhboy is missing, the rest is the same as the other PA's :)

i can give you an owl for free if you're on xbox

Yes this is why i leave the armor and weapon benches outside my CAMP house.
---
Two days ago I saw my CAMP was under attack, because the guy just wanted to use the bench inside.
---
Because we are two individuals. That is who you get two people.  How ever since  [u/zirfeld](https://www.reddit.com/user/zirfeld/)  doesn't want to reply maybe you can respond how a minority and majority can deal with such a wide difference in game play experience. Particularly the server based disconnections which are independent of the game's code it self.
---
PS4.  I don't attempt to use the trade screen very often, but when I do, it does work.
---
  Most of the time though, arrangements are made via mic, and we drop paper bags.
---
Works for me.
---
I think right now people will literally give anything for one of these haha 
---
I'd also like it if they made a change to the emote wheel, where the top one is highlighted, so rather than having to move one over and back, it starts there. 
---
OMG, I didnt even know something like this was possible!
---
This really needs fixing, I use 3 or 4 lever actions, and adding them to the favourites wheel on entering every new world, is pretty annoying! 
---
That blows.
---
That is kind of you to allow folks to use.

Why the entire audio of tje game is muffled during the whole time i play? Are you really telling me the game is like that
---
Nah. It's nice to have a place to lament the shortcomings of the game, but there's plenty of good here. But I'm completely an optimist.  And really do enjoy this game, bugs and all.  
---
Bounty tho?
---
Game sales info isn't exact but shows only a few million copies. Game was off the top ten best selling games by december. 
---
Trophy percentage data isn't exact, but shows only 29% of players played enough to reach level 25. 
---
So a million players is probably generous. The actual data indicates a much lower number, but since it's always possible to say "well the numbers were a little off" we should assume the most generous interpretation. 
---
I have not done the event at all and willing to play yet.  (level 140).
---
Having 5 rare masks not drop for me wont ruin the game I spent 240+ hours playing.  
---
I would rather have those people who got the masks have rewards that feel rare.  Not like TSE ended up.
---
Masks are just cosmetic they dont give 1 person an ability over another person.   
---
Let the people who got the masks feel special.  
---
I do not understand how having an item drop for Person A will ruin the game for Person B.
---
I played WoW for 5 years(I think?) and in that time I probably need the 45 baron Run about 200-300 times.   The very rare horse dropped twice in all that time, and I watched other members of the party get the horse.  I was happy for them.  Not once did I think, that was totally unfair and it should drop for everyone!   The horse actually added a huge benefit too!
---
I did not see everyone flaming blizzard about the drop rate either.  Much hate is focused on this game when it really does not deserve it.  Heck, I would have been happy to get the Teir 0.5 armor piece for my druid that I never actually ended up getting.  This was when the level limit was 50 for WoW.
---
No, then it would be a common drop, not a rare drop.
---
News flash, little fella.  When Survival Mode goes live and you’re playing in Butterfly Mode, there will still be assholes trying to ruin your game in Butterfly.  
---
What will your excuse and complaint be then?
---
Lmao umm ok? I never said I’m not going to play the survival game mode I’m actually excited for it but its disappointing that they are allowing characters that exploited exp glitches and so on. I don’t play fallout 76 because I found it boring but I thought pvp was fun until the exp glitches people started to get god weapons and gear because of it and so on. Survival mode could’ve fixed that but they aren’t and it’s a beta so who knows maybe they will. Which means they ADJUST ADAPT and OVERCOME. Or keep grieving lowbies in survival. Not my problem 
---
There are both. A friend added a mod to his Dragon.
---
It’s more like a self awareness of what needs to get better. We aren’t all hating the game and wallowing in our self loathing 
---
You are not alone, what i don't like is that most upvoted post today was something about how bad survival mode will be, before anyone had chance to touch it. Ppl are ugly monsters!
---
I have found very little to not like about fallout 76. Then again I am easy to please.
---
Half of the people being hateful towards this game are those who bought it and had a hard time playing first day with all the initial bugs, the other half never played the game or even own one but just hateful hoping it makes them look like they are gamer elite.
---
This is no different than Blackberry where half of the haters never own or even used a Blackberry their whole life but spend their times condemning the phone.
---
I quit doing it after spending a day constantly repeating the event 
---
The grind is not fun and I don’t have the time to waste seeking something that’s stupidly rare in such a small time 
---
Did you skip the rest of my comment? That doesn't invalidate a thing I say. A few hundred out of hundreds of thousands isn't any better. I made sure to say "confirmed" players. These are people we _know_ have recieved the rarer masks 
---
The likelihood of receiving a rare mask (0.3% or 0.03%) itself should convince you that this is far too rare.
---
Please cease spamming this topic with irrelevant names of objects from different games. Please also cease explaining obvious things and for once try to analyse the incoming message.
---
Also, quit connecting the dot bullshit, because so far you haven't shown yourself to be the expert. No camp staying on server = no possibility of controling the ground. No controlling the ground = no chances of loosing the control of the ground due to other player activities. No risks of loosing stuff while not playing = the game is not designed around controlling something you worked for hard and loosing it. Design thats not based on controlling something = indifference on what you build or which area you try to control. All this makes the ARK example irrelevant, and in F76 it will be a hide-and-seek for people who want a tense Fallout exploration experience, not yet another ARK-Rust.
---
 I do believe that you confuse starting out from zero with starting out this same and this is so fundamentally wrong that I don't know what else to tell you if you don't see it. If you separate thr servers, it will not favor the majority of the minority and you admitted it to be natural for PvP environments. If you are elitists that want to take advantage of your knowledge, admit it, and dont hide yourself under the "fairness" label because you are not representing it.
---
Maybe you have to be the last one to turn in a stein?
---
Luck perk card that eats a stimpack. Auto-stim armor prefix. Ghoulish.
---
&gt; I completely understand they are rare masks I respect that maybe like do it 50 times guaranteed 
---
If it's guaranteed then what would be the point of something being rare? All that means is people would run the event till they got what they believed they are owed.
---
No one is owed a rare mask. That's not the point of this event. It's to have fun. Maybe some people have different reasons for playing any game or any aspect of the game.
---
But a person's reasons doesn't really beat the reason why something was made. This was made to be a fun, community event, that one of the rewards are fun silly masks to wear, and in about a few weeks after, leave in your stash box, until the event next year. 
---
I saw something from a game designer not too long ago saying about how online communities dont reflect game sizes, it was something about the total size of the inline community, people who like the game enough to actively follow groups online about it, only equate to about 5 to 10% of the total game population, this sub alone has 170,000 subscribers, so at the higher end of that estimate would say this is 10% of the game pop, so roughly 17 million players in total.  This is nly basd off the video i saw though
---
I’m just continuing my quixotic quest for a BE Gatling laser.
---
But yea, shit gets repetitive.
---
Why do you need those masks? What if Bethesda never made the super rare ones? I really don't get you guys. What do you miss in life?
---
I would say only ghoulish might be should be counter by this. Others take stimpak sand it should be fine. 
---
then just continue playing adventure mode. This mode wasn't intended for PVE casuals who don't like to be shot at.
---
It's a competitive PVP version. If you don't like competing then you won't enjoy it.
---
Haven't noticed it but I never have more than one of a weapon kind there, that would be annoying
---
It should have been overly entitled, but I was responding using my phone instead of my computer, and my skills typing on a phone are not that good.
---
Entitled and overly entitled are the same thing. Only saying overly is meant to point out people who are really taking their entitlement way to far. Generally people that get angry when anyone disagrees with them. 
---
They took a really beloved series and made an asset flip cash grab that cost 60 bucks, had barely any content, crashed constantly, and is rife with 'microtransactions' where things like gun skins cost 20 dollars (including attempts at doing pay to win microtransactions where you can buy more HP temporarily). 
---
You shouldn't defend a game like this, besthedia is a billion dollar company not some scrappy indie, you shouldn't be one of the brain washed idiots that bought a bad game and now is posting about how they "donate" money every month to microtransaction to try to make a better game come.   
---
This should have been a free to play early access game. 
---
Could be fun
---
I was bummed it disappeared on me when I got close.
---
No its not.  I'm just playing the statistics game.   But I doubt anyone has done it 1000 times though.
---
They mean basically the same thing. Though I was using over entitled to point out that some take it to the point of being angry or hostile to anyone that disagrees with that they believe.
---
Manual stim? Sure thing. Auto-stim? Beats thd point completely if we want to keep this grenade more of a smoke grenade and less of a DPS grenade.
---
I can sell you a 2 shot. Thinks it's a 3* lvl 40 with 25% faster fire rate If you want it I'll double check it's stats.
---
Having different "decks" to swap between sounds awesome!
---
Maybe in Belgium as well. I refer to a fairly little art piece at a factory entrance.
---
I see what you mean the recipe also calls for salt and spices which I think would control the limit well. Hack the recipe requires an insane amount of ingredients anyway.
---
I am so doing this!
---
While I have all of the rifles that you described, I'm finding that my go-to is a combat rifle with a recon scope and suppressor.  The damage per shot is significantly less, but the high rate of fire and large magazine make up for it.  I can generally land 4 headshots in the time it takes to fire two round out of a lever action or one shot from a hunting rifle.  With a piercing magazine and a hardened receiver the baddies (like super mutants) tend to stagger from head shots, giving more time to squeeze off more rounds.
---
You know it's good when the Murder Church guy is behind it.
---
Yusssssssssssssssssssssssßsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
---
there is absolutely no problem getting a majority and a minority that have different experiences for the same event. for example a concert where you have hundreds or thousands of people and all of them share the same experience. and then you have the actor on the stage that is part of the same event but has definitly a complete different experience of the event. everything is relative.
---
I agree I did it all day for 2 days and started some today but I just gave up. No point in wasting the time I could be doing something more rewarding.
---
I wouldn't really trust the poll that much. The number on it is too small to get an accurate reading, also we cant trust that everything someone says is truthful. I met someone with a rare mask who said he got it after the 15 or 16th attempt. 
---
Now before you downvote me for saying something against the drop rates being low. Let me ask this, would you rather trust 9k people who've done the event like a couple times sometimes not getting a mask drop because one of the robots died, or one guy who's done it 100 times? 
---
An increase would be neat, but the poll numbers dont mean much in the end. 
---
Fallout isnt dead, I still have faith that fo5 is going to be a proper fallout game, I see this as just a bit of fun
---
Paying attention to detail is the going to significantly add to their workload.
---
&gt; it’s probably for the best that Bethesda gets all this hate so they don’t release an unfinished game again. Or else we just encourage them to do it again
---
While I agree I don't think it will work. Mass Effect Andromeda for example got a big backslash and EA cancelled all post launch content for that game (and sequels maybe? Not sure) but that didn't stop them from releasing Anthem in what many people consider an unfinished state. They just ignored Andromeda to avoid bad sales.
---
Same thing can happen here. And people are probably going to buy Skyrim's sequel or Bethesda's new ip no matter how much hate they get from Fallout 76. And Fallout 76 does deserve a lot backslash no doubt, but holy shit I've never seen so much hate for a game. So many people I know have talked shit about it despite never playing any Fallout, like it's trending or something.
---
I know that people here hate the idea because it's a nerf, but I still think the right development decision would have been to make it so that you can change your perk loadout only once a day or on leveling up. Then choosing to be good at lockpicking or choosing to have cheap fast travel instead of being good at combat would be an actual strategic decision involving a sacrifice. 
---
They can't go back though. One of the truisms of game development is that once you've given players something, you can't take it away without incurring a huge amount of player dissatisfaction, and this game can't afford that hit. 
---
If your purpose is afk and hiding, as long as the really passive healing is countered that should be enough. 
---
Using stim is an item with limited supplies if they are afk. 
---
I never said I didn't like the complexity in fact other than the cooking oil all the other ingredients seem worth it to me because you really have to go out of your way to make this item.
---
So they already accept game input, put something in game so more people in game can give input, even if solid things aren’t given by the votes it’ll keep pesky people who haven’t played for a while brewing trouble.
---
There is cooking  oil in flatwoods next to the cooking bench outside the responder bar, and one in the trailer with the ammo bag and safe. There are also 3-4 in Morgantown high school, and they can usually be found in random unmarked houses 
---
I keep my camp unlocked so anyone can come by and use the benches beds whatever, 6 purifiers and open too. I spend most of my time exploring so would be a shame for them to go to waste
---
Yes, I read it all, and no, I'm not trying to invalidate your position.  
---
I'm just pointing out it is very likely there are many more out there we don't know about, for the reason(s) I stated.
---
Yup. It is actually called "Ultrazit" like that. But it is "unobtainium" in Avatar like in the english version. I might just have called it that if I didn't know it better.. xD
---
But the suffix -it... most of those stones are labeled with it but I believe there are exeptions.. -tin and -thrin are used as well there.
---
So Scorch instead of Scourge. I guess my World of Warcraft brain did this.. like.. "the scourge"... derp. :P
---
Thank you very much!
---
That’s why giving input in game would be valuable, people who complain and don’t play wouldn’t get that much of a say, and the polls don’t have to be solid decisions.
---
Well I didn't say you didn't like the complexity. I said it was more complex because. I used that word, because my way of thinking is that items that aren't that common make recipes more complex, because you have to do a lot more work in find the ingredients. Like knowing places to find cooking oil
---
I am myself hoping that the Purveyor(?) guy will help the game and put it in right direction.
---
I think the role of RNG is as follows. Lets say you want a piece of great armor. Lets say its assasin cavalier. You should be able to reliably get control of two legendary perks through some expensive crafting. Lets say you wanted a perfect roll, assasin cavalier ap-refresh. Now to go from great gear to perfect gear you need RNGesus.
---
I don't think duped gear is such a problem as many people believe it is. Its not the gear that is thr greatest advantage of no-lifes, its access to time and game-related knowledge. Within this post you'll find a guy who discussed builds with me and started from calling what I say bullshit. That guy knew some stuff and after some discussion he realised I can back my stuff up, he retracted his 'its bs' statement. Please believe me that if I loose access to my precious gear, my situation compared to my opponents will be better than it was day before.
---
Thats how it works for new people in any launched mmorpg man.
---
Bethesda shouldn't have mentioned they look at Reddit for suggestions lol
---
I know right same thing is happening to me it stopped happening when i had to restart my xbox so try to do that
---
"Oops, they only oppened a cache that wasn't for them. I'll let them BE." \*cough cough\*
---
And even if you had zero atoms and there was a PA skin you wanted, you still wouldn’t be “required” to spend any money. You just wouldn’t get the skin you wanted.
---
Well, I guess it depends on how well any person can remember where to find certain things. I have always had way too much pepper, salt and spices in my stash, because some of the food I like to make calls for them. 
---
Other than cooking oil, the only thing I see being a speed bump are frog eggs. But again, where to find rad toads are all fixed locations as well. 
---
I hope they eventually add ammo dropping on death. If we're losing our aid and junk, ammo should be included
---
i would take some off that nuclear radiated weed plz!!!!!
---
I agree - I don’t even have any super heavy OP weapons I could have dragged out of my stash!! 😆
---
how do you farm fusion cores? I have difficulty finding a lot of them. 
---
Even so, out of a sample size such as this, 20 is abysmal. And, even if there are many others out there, the drop chance is 0.03%. This means you either need unnatural luck, or you need to be a robot to get even a _single_ rare mask.
---
I know there could be hundreds of rare ones floating around, but the stats are still very unfair.
---
Server disconnects are back big time since the last patch on Xbox. I don't like the snail paced load in times either. It takes my camp up to two minutes to load in.
---
I think they should do a poll in game or something and see what everyone wants. Honestly I could go either way, but in the long term, I think a fresh start survival would be the way to keep the game alive, entertaining, and having something to work towards.
---
Saw the funniest thing yesterday, jiucehead made a video about how outer worlds is an epic games exclusive for the first 12 months, so this absolute saviour of everything that fo76 should have been blah blah blah is turning out to be... Wait for it... Over hyped
---
I cant stand the suggestions anymore. People want their own personalized dream game. shut uppppp
---
So that's why my secondary melee was missing in my favourites! Now it makes sense. Thank you.. I just got mad every time that would happen. It's since that new update was out, was it?
---
Nuke zones are pretty big, start farming in the opposite direction
---
Ikr it is really annoying you know trying to decorate and this stupid game will not let us
---
Dang thanks
---
It wasnt you. But where did you get those 
---
I used to do kind of similar things like this in fallout. Put all my explosives in an explosive crate. Put all my clothes in my dresser 
---
It doesn't always have to be about making money or caps.  Some people just want to play the game.
---
Hell yea, democracy!
---
Complaining about people complaining. 
---
People who will try to afk-win are not competetive. They will be cheating. I know of one duping method - reported it to Bethesda, stepped into it like you step into shit, rolled back my spoiled meat several times, havent used it since, destroyed the item that was causing it, never explained the details to anybody besides Beth employees. Maybe somebody else found it too. Maybe there are others. I assume whoever decides to break the worlds record on longest live-time will have 18000 stims on them when they go AFK (thats about the maximum amount of they will be able to carry together with their gear). Thats 150 hours of auto-stimpacking. Good luck.
---
Would you rather only being able to grab select items from select boxes and have to run around everywhere for your stuff?
---
I agree with your point about immersion but it’s easy to figure why they did it.
---
What if grenades worked like fo3 pick pocket and they would blow up mid air. Thatd be dope.
---
Well it was more explaining my issue, and then asking a question based on my issue, so, a debate/discussion, if you will.
---
I think survival mode would be infinitely better with having Seasons, and each new season would retire your last season character to a 'Legacy Survival' mode and a new character would join the current season, with a couple new perks/items/enemies each season to keep people wanting to play.
---
Polling booths are for a quest to make you president for future dlc.
---
This is a ultra-rare mask to acquire and I imagine most folks are not willing to part with it fi they've managed to get it.  I am extremely interested in the gargoyle looking mask but haven't even caught wind of anyone acquiring it.  Some possible confirmation of the sun mask being owned by ONE player.    
---
I wonder if we could get u/Valseek or u/Ladydevann to comment on this. 
---
I never said it was impossible to find cooking oil I said it was very hard to. Also it gets Mass scraped which is bad. I'm up for any kind of fix remove it from the recipe or added to some container drop tables or whatever but I think we can both agree it needs to be removed from the scrap everything option in workshop.
---
who gives a shit, in a couple of days it'll be full of level 200+ characters anyway
---
I was so sure you’d do something at the parade haha. I for one think this is better :) A+ like always 
---
I think we are going to start to see different boxes holding different subsections of stuff from our shared stash. The fermenter is a good example of that. It holds only alcohol but it takes room in the stash. I’ve also seen a photo of a refrigerator stash box that will probably operate the same way, but it will keep your food better longer. 
---
I have done the event 60+ times now and have never seen a single rare mask but the possibility of getting one is enough to keep me doing the event. I find grinding in video games enjoyable for some reason and with the added chance of getting something that basically no one else on earth has will keep me going until the event is over. 
---
For me it’s the opposite, until the recent Survivor mode stuff this subreddit has been very pleasant and enjoyable. 
---
You just get the odd memetard or ‘dead game’ idiot that appears to have nothing better to do with their time than troll.
---
Do this! The trick to a more enjoyable reddit experience is to subscribe to more sub-reddits.  R/filthycasuals is always upbeat.
---
There’s a 20% xp boost, if they make it a fresh start they should just make it like 30% and then if you really wanna level that quickly get that perk that gives 15% more while on a team. Level ups left and right
---
easily? what a fucking joke. Obviously you don't mod. That shit is hundreds of hours of HARD WORK
---
Do any of the Powering Up power plant events. Once you complete you can fire up a generator that makes one fusion core every 10ish minutes. I farmed 15 cores one night and have been stocked even since. 
---
Alternatively, players sell 100% charged fusion cores for around 30-50 caps is you’ve got extra money. 
---
I want custom severs to do stuff like this.
---
Tbh not trying to be a jerk. I understand what you are saying but you cannot countered a cheat by using a legit method. It will make that method overpower. 
---
Wouldn't work for me.  being colorblind I would still have to turn off all quests but the one I'm actively working on to de-clutter the HUD
---
Awesome. Thanks for the tip. 
---
It's not easy though. I had the old mod but now you have to know all your perks by heart or wrote them down or whatever in order to use the nukes and dragons or whatever, I got confused and gave up 
---
What platform are you on? If Xbox I can give you 5-7 cores later today. 
---
I ran it solo last night all the way through.  I was on a server that only had one other person on it when the event started. I tried to add them to a team to get them to join in, but they never came.  It was a pain gathering everything for the parade, but there was plenty of time to get it all done.  I ended up getting 4 of the robots back alive (damn mutant suicider snuck through and got one).  At the end, I got the toothy man mask which I didn't have yet, so it was worth it. It is definitely more challenging alone.
---
Yeah I totally understand that this might be difficult from a technical standpoint, but its easy enough to differentiate between your STASH BOX stash (i.e. the one that literally says "STASH") and other more world-appropriate forms of stash.
---
Maybe the coming vendor updates will improve this...
---
Just move on bro. Some like it some don’t. Don’t work yourself up any more than you already have 
---
Maybe click on the player on the map and be shown a wanted poster with the player's icon, and a list of offences.
---
He’s shown up a few times during my parades but unfortunately I haven’t been the one insulted :(
---
Switching the cooking oil from being auto scrapped to not being auto-scrapped would also suffice I believe.  
---
You can find a decent ammount if you know where to look out for.  
---
Waiting to see how 'decorate your camp with stash items' is going to work.  Have the idea of wall mounting the ones i have
---
What times are you generally online? I'd like to pop in and check out your plan selection.
---
So there's hope! That's awesome news!
---
The last 2 SBQ events I have gone to since patch 7 I have either been kicked by the server or the game froze.
---
This game is painful.
---
Probably don't care about you at all, and not about pvp. That's my guess.
---
LET ME PLAY THE SIMS FALLOUT DAMNIT
---
Since patch 5 so it's been a problem for a while now
---
&gt;Please cease spamming this topic with irrelevant names of objects from different games. Please also cease explaining obvious things and for once try to analyse the incoming message.
---
Just because you don't have a clue about what I say isn't my fault. Google exists and it can provide the supplemental data needed.  
---
&gt; Also, quit connecting the dot bullshit, because so far you haven't shown yourself to be the expert.  
---
Pretty ironic coming from someone making snide remarks about people being ignorant while at the same time literally arguing against the very concept of the game mode.
---
&gt; No camp staying on server = no possibility of controling the ground. No  controlling the ground = no chances of loosing the control of the ground  due to other player activities. No risks of loosing stuff while not  playing = the game is not designed around controlling something you  worked for hard and loosing it. 
---
Yes in the base game how ever the entire reason Survial exists is because players complained about the lack of loss and how weak PvP is in the main game. The entire point of Survival and the change to how you lose items is based around adding more depth and risk to PvP to make it more fun and and enjoyable for people who like PvP.  Your argument is literally the reason why this game mode exists in the first place.  If people were happy with the state of PvP in the game the Survival game mode wouldn't exist.  
---
&gt;All this makes the ARK example irrelevant, and in F76 it will be a  hide-and-seek for people who want a tense Fallout exploration  experience, not yet another ARK-Rust. 
---
No it makes it quite relevant because you complained about losing gear you had to grind to get access to. Well in Ark you lose gear you grinded to have access to as well.  In fact the grind on Ark is 10x more harsh then it is on 76 even if you are playing on a PvE server.   
---
So it is entirely relevant to talk about when you complain about how long it will take to replace a quad shot explosive harpoon and try to use the logic that people joining 6 months down the road will be at a disadvantage over people playing it since the game mode was launched. 
---
&gt; I do believe that you confuse starting out from zero with starting out  this same and this is so fundamentally wrong that I don't know what else  to tell you if you don't see it. If you separate thr servers, it will  not favor the majority of the minority and you admitted it to be natural  for PvP environments. If you are elitists that want to take advantage  of your knowledge, admit it, and dont hide yourself under the "fairness"  label because you are not representing it. 
---
So knowing how to play the game makes you elitist now? That is some interesting logic there.  Learning is part of the game. Struggling against other players is part of PvP.  Players who put more time and effort into the game having the advantage over you is par the course for PvP games of any kind.  You are literally arguing for a loop hole that allows you to avoid dealing with those things and literally undermines the entire point of having the game mode exist in the first place.
---
I quit after a 9 hour first day, not worth it at all. Great event but this is crazy! Most people would be lucky to get 9 hours throughout the entire event but when an entire sub has almost no photos of a rare masks, no trades, no nothing why would anyone do it. Crazy 
---
Counterpoint: the minute Bethesda gave details about PVP in the base game, people suggested creating separate PVP and PVE servers. Then about 6 months later Bethesda (essentially) did this.
---
Bethesda's job, as you put it, is to make a game that *other people like*. Think about a hairdresser - surely a customer might have *something* useful to say before the hairdresser starts cutting? There's telling someone how to do their job, and then there's a customer giving feedback regarding their preferences.
---
Given the lead time on responding to feedback (game development is a slower process than people seem to realize), I don't see the problem with giving the devs a heads up on possible issues before they go live so they can at least start thinking about the matter.
---
Everyone starts from the same spot is how you make fair PvP. 
---
IKR RIGHT COME ON NOW BETHESDA
---
Ditto. I can't figure out perk load out manager anymore 
---
You indeed can counter a cheats by giving the players appropriate tools. I hardly believe suggesting adding a weapon with the single lowest DPS variable will be overpowered.
---
TSE lever action with perception.  
---
The problems people are describing are a result of the changes they made last patch, nothing you can do about it.  FO76 and most online games use very little bandwidth and don't require high mb/s connections.   Doing a speed test for diagnosis isn't very helpful because the servers and routing used is going to be different than your connection to the Amazon datacenters FO76 uses.  While you need to meet be the minimum bandwidth required for the game, latency is the important measurement (time it takes for your packets to reach their destination).  You can have a gigabit fiber connection but your experience will be terrible if it has high latency.  
---
Your username is relevant. 
---
Literally thousands of players are still enjoying the hell out of this game. Nobody said it's perfect. And no game is going to be right for every player.
---
Find something else you can enjoy. 
---
Wow, what an inconvenience, now i have to store the workbench, place it somewhere else and lock the door so he can't get in. Or block him and change servers. This is probably the worst griefing I've ever heard of, this is such a non problem it's ridiculous. Takes 3 seconds to render his griefing pointless and if you place one more workbench of the same type he can only occupy one, and he's not gonna spend hours upon hours just sitting there regardless so.
---
17 in lewisburg?
---
What critters are you running across?
---
Agreed... I know I can choose to stay out of the new PVP mode, however, I spend a ton of time on workshops because it’s a great way to collect resources quickly. In my opinion, with the new mode, it seems like PvP players will come back into the less aggressive mode to restock their resources and will go after workshops in every lobby. With rewards and bonuses they’ll get from being in survival, they’ll be even more OP than most of the high level players...gonna make it difficult for the average player to take advantage of workshops.
---
I think people just want to keep the duped weapons and armor out of the PVP server to give those who didn't dupe or buy duped stuff a fair chance.
---
You are awesome! 
---
Just out of curiosity: how did you get all the serum plans? I'm trying to get some for me, at least for the mutations i use constantly 
---
I don't often have spare low level armor or guns to share (though I guess I could craft some stuff up). But I always leave everything unlocked and welcome anyone to pop by and use any of the workbenches, beds, water, etc. that they want.  I don't see any reason to lcok it all down.
---
Will absolutely be getting the Brace thing and the Hoodie, both look awesome
---
Don't forget Brahmin milk it's a coin flip on how much you'll get from them. It's a recipe that requires 6 to 7 different ingredients all with varying amounts needed. That takes some elbow grease the time to gather.
---
Don't try to reason with them, when you see someone saying we shouldn't make suggestions to Bethesda because their devs clearly know what they are doing it is obvious they must have arrived from a different timeline.
---
It's more about the gear than the levels.  
---
I'm not assuming that.   I'm saying the ones who don't play a lot are the majority
---
I’m enjoying it. Been a fan of the franchise for like 20 years and am honestly having lots of fun in 76. 
---
I make my own fun, and don’t dwell too much on ‘popular opinion’. 
---
I’ve noticed a lot of lag this week, but otherwise I’ve been almost entirely unaffected by all the chaos people say is affecting the game. 
---
How did you get it?
---
"Bethesda please!" Anyone who starts a post like this can fucking drop dead.
---
right that makes more sense.
---
I swear no one plays the games they review nor do they even do the tiniest bit of research into them. They just post garbage rave and rant style reviews or copy and paste from reddit. There is no such thing as an honest unbiased review in the gaming world anymore.
---
Polygon aka the worst of the worst said "A two-shot explosive (or TSE) rifle means what it says: It kills in two shots and has an explosive damage modifier." 
---
Lmao they've never even played a Fallout game. I'd link the article but fuck them no free clicks. However I will provide a screen shot.
---
Polygon TSE lmao https://imgur.com/a/KgW174P
---
Lvl 134, never heard of it. 
---
Obtaining A set would be pretty quick, but you're right that the huge amount is due to duping. Still will be easy to get a somewhat good set a couple of days after release with some RMT.
---
I would say jetpack + AP refreshes, but you still have a limited height you can fly to before you have to land again before going higher
---
Sorry.   You're not going to dictate for me what I can play.  The game mode is going to allow us to go into it with our current characters.   
---
How does one find it?
---
You can get it for free by going to the brotherhood terminals after completing there quests 
---
It was tucked behind a locker kinda in fort defiance. Im a very in depth searcher lol 
---
I'm kind of happy with the owl mask. It matches my outfit.
---
I am almost always on between 5:15-6:30pm EDT during the week and then often 8-10:30pm EDT with more time during the weekends usually.  My username here is same as my gamertag.  Anything specific you are looking for that I could look through my inventory?
---
Yeah right now it's either complaining about the yet to be released survival mode(Wait until it's dropped) or the event that has an abysmal drop rate for the "rarer" masks.  
---
Not always. Ive done 3 charecters and only got the ultracite plans. Maybe theres a drop rate? Not sure
---
Also they're calling it survival beta so this first iteration is supposed to be testing ground
---
I dont think so because they will think that you are in europe not in the U.S.
---
Make it a fresh start.
---
Remove legendaries from Survival. No legendaries means that it will be a lot more skill-based.
---
Make Survival teams have a cap of 2 players. Groups of multiple teams can still happen but they wont be able to share perk cards with each other. 
---
Try ebay anyways there are used fallout 76 games in gamestop for the same price 
---
Yeah the 20% exp seems to be designed to lure "prey" into pvp worlds which will in turn increase ranking (or whatever they call it) for PvP enthusiasts. Which will inevitably increase their bounty. I can see what Bethesda is aiming at.
---
But still there are people with gear that has 40% reduced damage from players PLUS 75% damage reduce when moving or standing still, these people exist because of dupe trading and they will have godly VATS weapons that 1 shot people.
---
So it will be like "do you want to play as a rabbit"? For most peoples. 
---
Focus on a few weight reduction perks;  Ballistic Ammo or Batteries Included are something you should get right away.
---
Weight reduction perk for Junk its great.
---
Set self-limits on number of components to keep in your stash, sell the rest. (i.e.  100 of each, except 1000 steel, 300 screws, 300 springs, ect)
---
Pick up everything, but only keep components based on your limit.
---
Do not tote around a weapon that is +5/+10 levels over you.  You will find another when the time comes.
---
Make/scrap Leather armors until you get the Studded mod.  Make a full set of studded leathers and have some of the highest resists for armors on the server.  Heavy leathers are best but light also has good numbers.
---
I was whimiscal and took perks as I felt as I leveled and found that I now have to get 40+ levels after level 140 to respec my character to how I want.  There are some sites out there that let you plan the perk cards yourself, so you can get the character you want without being in my situation.  
---
Pay attention to your weight. You dont need to carry around 30+ soups and 50+ water.   About 10 soups and maybe 5 additional water should work for an hour or two, then just hit your camp up for more.   Plant some corn/carrots/mutfruit at your camp so you can make the soups easily.  One purifier is enough to really get all the water you need.   Make a CAMP early, you can make it ... decently.  Dont wait until level 40 to finally build your camp.    Even if its just a small shack on the side of the road, go ahead and make your life easier.  Its free fast travel too!   Move your CAMP to new locations when your quests move you.
---
Also the +durability perks for armor/gun smithing improves them quite a bit.   With leathers, when they break, just recraft them.  Dont bother repairing.  But they fixed the repair costs in the last patch so maybe thats better?

To be proper here, wouldn't it be appropriate to put this polling in survival mode? A lot of players have no intention of playing survival mode. Last I remember, less than 10% of the PSN players had completed the challenge to kill 20 people. Should 90% of the player base that won't ever touch this game mode decide what happens for the other 10%?
---
But yeah, I really wish Bethesda would stop over-relying on reddit for feedback. Find some more avenues to get feedback
---
It's good for leveling, because it's fully modded version of Hunting Rifle. But it's the same as you mod it by yourself, just faster ;)
---
Its crafted with a recon scope. Its actually a nice rifle! If it was legendary it would be pretty awesome but ive never seen one drop
---
I see well it's true you could memorize where to find cooking oil. I myself in my experience don't run into it that often and when I do they're very far apart and usually only find one per location. 
---
I'm not really arguing that I don't like the choice that they put cooking oil in but the fact I myself feel that cooking oil in the recipe it's like the last straw in making it not worth pursuing.
---
Also please please remove it from the scrap all list if you're going to have it be an ingredient.
---
You can go to each quest and turn them off.  Definitely makes life easier.  On your Pipboy under Data you can toggle each on/off.
---
Forgive me if I am misunderstanding but wouldn't radiation still kill them? Afaik there isn't an afk rad removal method.
---
Technically you can do that by de-selecting the quests you aren't focused on in your Pip-Boy, and then re-select then again later.
---
It's a little convoluted but if you only want to see one quest on your screen that will do it!
---
Lol i dont need to fake shit pull your head otu your ass and look at the date that was posted and think what lvl i would be now :/ idiot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EmjWEyA6BY&amp;lc=z23zzhjxrzvxihqmyacdp43bhjdadt0ejxtm0zgsielw03c010c
---
Bought them from other players. They are a RNG drop from the Scorched Beast Queen.
---
i could say they got scammed probably worth only 660 caps but i mean it seems that a lvl 134 never has heard of it which i guess means people think it is rare and accept paying 1000 caps for it.
---
It's a vast right wing conspiracy.
---
Not necessarily. Small political ads, like the garrahan mining or brewing, could be narrative devices... "Vote for me, I'll make Fasnacht more fun!" "Support me, the Grafton Mayor, I'll ban the hunting quest" Head off to a voting booth, vote at a terminal, get a ballot item/per character that prevents voter fraud, and move along. There could be a Super Mutant Horde that threatens election integrity. Modus could say things that make you think it's all been rigged. 
---
The one on top of the Bunker rear door garage was missing for me the other day.
---
Then 2 days ago I picked it up and 60(!) caps, went inside and BOOM server rollback.  I reconnected and it had 18 caps.  :(
---
That makes sense. Giving this to a very low level would give them an exceptional advantage!
---
Hm maybe im just unlucky in finding them.
---
I would say it is a fairly rare drop. I have done the event 60+ times and only gotten it twice.
---
I had insult bot show up one time then graham another. Half the group during the parade ran over to him and two bots ended up dieing lol
---
Yes, but there's 10 brahmin in flatwoods, that refresh like every 10 minutes, so at 2-6 milk per. So a couple of minutes will get you easily enough milk. 
---
I don't know how anyone in here is claiming to know what the "most duped" weapons were. Literally nobody knows, maybe someone who does the numbers at Bethesda could find out.
---
You're all just speculating.
---
Anyone else able to complete his daily quest of Drink Fresh Rum, Test your agility by performing sneak attack?
---
I have crafted several Rums with fermentation, drank, and had multiple sneak attacks without it seeming to register. Next online session it resets back to drink fresh rum again and the loop continues. I am not sure if I am missing something with this daily quest?
---
Maybe different shapes?  At least for main, side, daily, and misc.
---
They offered it lol. They were all on a team and i think around level 35ish. I had one in my inventory and the one guy offered 1000 caps. Then his buddies asked if i could make them one as well. Of course i did it for them.
---
A concert isn't the same thing as programing. You can use that concert example to talk about enjoyment of the game. But not about the bugs, glitches and server issues. 
---
stealth boy says what?
---
    Wasting your breath.  I tried using the same logic yesterday on another sub...that if they were more common they wouldn't be rare and was washed away in a tsunami of down votes
---
It's still a random variable also I think you counting the two dead ones.
---
I didn't say anything about game communities. The game sales are from sales charts, the achievement percentages are from stuff like the PS4 sharing that. Very few people bought this game and very few people played it to even reach level 25, or did much game past the opening. This game did very poorly. (rightfully so)
---
I think your personal spawn location is always north of the current camp device location.  I've placed my camp down 4 times in the same general area facing different directions and it's always north of the camp.
---
I'm a Beserker Myself, love the kit as a stealth sniper and heavy damage dealer, but can't do much against groups of enemies or hordes of robots in well lit areas (hint hint, all of the nuke silos) 
---
Maybe the markers could have little shapes that tell which kind of quest it is? That might help more! Or pointing in the direction of it shows a name of the quest or something....
---
Bethesda please posts are against the rules.  These are issues that have already been addressed by devs.  
---
Eh you confuse shit so hard I loose my belief in reasonableness of this discussion.
---
You wont loose any meaningful items in F76 due to PvP, unlike you would in ARK or Rust. Its junk and aid, nothing else. Comparing full loot drop game to partial loot drop game is indeed irrelevant, because these two games are fundamentally different. If Bethesda announced you'd be loosing your gear on death, then we'd be discussing about completely different game mode and irrelevant points would become relevant. We're not discussing other game mode, we are discussing F76 survival. The point with quad explosive harpoon was that you just can't go somewhere where quad explosive harpoons drop and farm it for ten eternities until you got the perfect one, as its not how the game is designed. Don't shove item examples out of your ass, look at the actual game, what are its mechanics, and what the consequences will be.
---
There are some sites online for PC where you pay like £7 (about $9) and they give you a code and you use the code to obtain the game.
---
Haven’t used it myself but some of my friends use it for a lot of their games.
---
Not sure what platform you’d like it on though but as other people have said, try eBay for physical copies for PS and XB1
---
Oh I agree, a poll when you log in would be fine. I'm just saying, people shouldn't worry to much about what people say the game should be from this forum. 
---
PS4. Thanks for the offer though!
---
Honestly don't trust this post, there's no evidence here they probably haven't even tested them all. Anyway, they listed non-hostile animals which would include Foxes.
---
Once you get the military I'd card, to to the terminal in front of the front door to fort Defiance and you can get the plan there
---
I still encounter bugs that have existed from beta. I still regularly get disconnected and have only played in the last month to do the special event and I didn’t particularly enjoy it because there were 10 people doing it at the same time. 
---
Fallout 76 is currently my favorite game and I’ll still play it regardless of how buggy and lacking content it is.  I do find the community really frustrating though. It’s either one extreme or the other. 
---
You should know I'm reporting you as spam every time you advertise that other sub.
---
Valid point that further justifies me having lots of weapons despite the fact one trick does the job most of the time.
---
The survival mode will be different, but what’s the fastest way for those guys to come back and resupply and prepare to go back into survival? Come in to adventure and take over workshops with their OP asses. I think it’s gonna be torture! 
---
He just turned up at a parade I just did. Not sure who he was after, just kept yelling to stop at someone then got smashed at the last bit lol
---
will you need to complete the belly of the beast quest to get it?
---
Maybe have it between PS4 and Xbox versions but i wouldn't want it with PC due to the different input methods, different settings and hackers/cheaters.
---
People, don’t pay for this weapon! Go to Fort Defiance and use the terminal right outside the front door. I think it’s called Artillery Battery Terminal or something like that. Then it will have an option to register new user and you can get the plans for yourself.
---
You are easily my entire family’s favorite You Tuber. Last night my little nephew visited, and he said “whatever you do, don’t fall for a maze that says ‘beat the maze, win prizes!’
---
I showed him your video last week.
---
there's is a 3 new skins for handmade coming, 1 full gold, 1 full silver and 1 with a mixture of gold and silver, i want the last one, looks so good :)
---
Yeah no issue on Xbox. I’ve seen 8 bikes go off since the event.  None at the parade.  
---
Someone did nuke Charleston last night.   Interesting. ( there were two owned workshops in the circle.  I wonder if that Gad anything to do with it. ) 
---
I just havent found a better rhyme to 'head', dont interpet that seriously ;)
---
From what I can tell, several improvements to the game are the result of discussions and changes requested here. I find that encouraging rather than depressing.
---
Entitled could mean you deserve it but it could be used in a context of you think you deserve it but don't.  "You are acting like an entitled moron" vs "you're entitled to 3 years of benefits"
---
Now now, we are cultured wastelanders.
---
Nukacoke, Fluxajuana, Quantum Caps, Blood Leaf Bacco, Snaptail Cigars, Blight Buttons, etc.
---
Ditto 
---
Where did Bethesda say "The rare Fasnacht Masks are attainable, they are just very rare. Thanks to your feedback, we're looking into improvments we can make to the drop rates in the future for rare item rewards associated with time limited events." ?? Can you link that source? 
---
Well that was dramatic...🤨
---
I like those ideas.  When I was still fairly fresh from the vault, I had no clue how to turn my quest markers off and tried to do Powering Up Poseidon.  I got  frustrated once I was inside the plant because I kept following quest markers that took me to a door leading back outside.  After 10 minutes or so, I just gave up on the event.  
---
Oohhh sorry
---
I placed my camp 4 stories up in a tree.  Visitors appear either on the ground next to the tree or in midair and fall.  When I travel to my camp alone, I materialize north of the camp device.  If friends are at my camp, sometimes I spawn above the original camp on the 8th floor.  When I log in to the world initially I always start north of the camp device and fall from the height of the camp (currently 6 stories in the air).
---
&gt; Also please please remove it from the scrap all list if you're going to have it be an ingredient.
---
This. Everytime Bethesda makes an item that is junk which is now needed to be used to make something, it should always be moved off the auto scrap list. 
---
The need for cooking oil is also offset by the fact that the doughnuts don't spoil. So as you find cooking oil (and remember to NOT scrap it) you can make them, then store them. 
---
They really are more of a fun food, for those that like such things, since they really don't do much. Where as the sausage are great way to use up spoiled meat. 
---
Yeah those sites only have it for those prices for European regions. When it comes to US, the prices are still around $45.
---
Wow, those guys sound like real winners ... I'm sorry that happened to you dude. :(
---
Just to be on the safe side I would advise you to record it.
---
No worries at all! I’ll be on some tonight, more tomorrow. We will catch each other some time!
---
Ah okay that’s a bit poo. Sorry man
---
Can’t hurt
---
Myself I'd prefer the legendary items are completely removed and the game featured fool loot drop. But they won't remove legendaries and include full loot drop so lets discuss reality.
---
They turn into red hot bloom.
---
omg :/
---
Ok the, anyone have a spare, or maybe 2 spare bonfire plans to trade for caps ? :D  (Xbox)
---
The gear can be gotten easily too.
---
I've also found that if teammates are at my camp, I sometimes spawn near the original camp location.
---
It is an interesting dichotomy. If you don't use a clean slate the people joining Survival Mode, then you are faced with the fact that you will have a lot of OP players with builds that can kill you with one shot. It becomes a roll of the dice who gets the first shot to win. 
---
Allowing people to bring their builds over from PvE does allow players to get their PvP on which clearly some folks want. I am not in that camp, but I can see the allure for some players.
---
The downside to not allowing people to bring over their current rig is that they may not want to leave PvE. Some have already mentioned that. This could be for various reasons: time, cheats, etc.
---
My concern is that if you don't allow the Griefers to bring their rig to Survival, they will continue to remain in the PvE environment and be a nuisance to those who want to play casually. You will always have some who will remain. The reasons are varied; public nuisance, or like to grief but can't win against real competition as examples.
---
I am torn on the approach. Someone mentioned death match. That might be a suitable alternative, but is not on the table as far as I know. If it did exist, then the point about tabula rasa (clean slate) wouldn't matter for starting the Survival mode as a new character. 
---
In any case, it will be highly unlikely I will play Survival mode anyway. I have no interest in it. I would rather have better content for casual play. The Fasnacht parade was a good start, but as noted in other posts. I have yet to see a rare mask like old man winter, and I have done the event about 50 times. You will see me dropping extra masks that I get at the parade. I pick them up after everyone leaves and drop them at the next event so new players can get them if they like. 
---
There are multiple voting locations across the map if I’m not mistaken.
---
Then they get you on duping supplies with no proof 
---
There are four that wander near the tents where the two ghouls are just trying to nap. Three behind the buildings near the east side of the overpass, and two that wander behind the restaurant on that little incline. The two that are dead, you can't milk. 
---
recreational outrage
---
If it removes each respective markers on my compass..that would be great!!!
---
Jesus Christ, my sides...
---
Next meme *claps*
---
It sure does!
---
You may as well tell us where it is, because you're NEVER going to be able to camp there again.  It will let you build it there but on the next login...
---
(And I'm really curious where it was.)
---
Yes. It gets wrecked.
---
what changes did they make between the original BETA and the launched game (none). 
---
He's legit, I'm signing on now for another purchase.
---
You would have to acquire 100.000 for them to consider banning you, but if you are going to feel safer recording it, do it.
---
I believe they’ll end up fixing it but it’ll be a No Man’s Sky situation where it probably won’t be a full game for another year or so. 
---
I’ve been playing since the beta and I’ve completed most quest lines and most of the content. Everyone is super excited about this special event which is done in 10 mins and one more quest line with some additional crafting options. 
---
It’s not nearly enough to keep me going and the things I’m excited about, that they said would be out in December/Jan, aren’t coming for a month at the earliest. 
---
Again, I’m sure they’ll fix it but it’ll be a long time till then and I probably won’t really play until then. 
---
I was a little surprised that dancing wasn't in the game from the start. 
---
I know that since we can drink and make booze, and it's even encouraged. But I get why not smoking. 
---
Definetly will try that. Hope it removes the markers on the compass too!
---
I'm 40 and on Xbox with the gamer tag Individuationis. Due to my current schedule of life responsibilities I am not online as often as I'd like to be. Feel free to send a message or friend request. While Fallout 76 is my primary game right now, I have numerous others I play. I've also got a small group of friends that I play with and join in party chats when possible. 
---
My gamer tag is Lady Rot Roh - the “rot roh” is meant to sound like how Scooby Doo says “uh oh” haha
---
You should get help 😁
---
Thanks Todd someone made a proper post about this.
---
Everything in the camp is destroyed. However if you have enough materials you can just repair it all to exactly the way it was before.
---
What are you talking about? There is no "industry standard" on what those terms mean. You're literally just spreading misinformation.
---
The drop rates are literally whatever the hell they want, then they just pick a word that somebody felt most appropriately represented that chance. Given that there's probably at most 10 terms that mean "rare" and *literally infinite* different possible specific rarities, do you not think that there might be a little variance?
---
Anecdotal evidence incoming - but yesterday we killed the legendary sloth in Fasnacht daily, and only I was able to loot it. For me it was lying on the ground dead. For others in my party it was floating.  
---
They are just masks ?! Why everyone cares that much ?   
---
I mean the drop rate is terrible and all i agree, but in the end i don't care to obtain them all anyway.
---
I'm still going to get people trying to tear me a new hole for saying this. But just the ones that seem overly buttsore about not getting a shiney new toy. Strangely my life won't change when that happens. But their lives are already wrecked, WRECKED I tell you, because Bethesda denied them the rare mask!
---
Not really, you get the plan for free when you do the BOS quest line, after finishing fort defiance you can use a terminal outside it to learn the plan. 
---
They are basically a hunting rifle with all the best mods pre-attached, and they cost the same to craft as a base hunting rifle. 
---
It IS a great weapon both for starting (level 1 usable) as well as viable late game as you craft higher level versions. 
---
I would not say however that it is rare, and the fact you found some people interested in getting one for 1k caps is good on you, though those players must either A. Not know it is a quest tree reward, or B. Do not want to do the DMV that quest tree needs XD. 
---
Either way enjoy your awesome craft-able rifle!
---
You are right and a delicate big-aoe rad grenade could do the trick aswell.
---
i don't get it why people think that it is somehow  justified that you have to pay for something that should have been part of the game from the start.
---
well, it should have been part of the game BEFORE it started. maybe during a closed BETA? ...
---
the perk card cluttering is just a mess and there should be an option to get rid of it and YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT ...
---
Well I assumed there would be some civil minded people here.  I like the idea of there being "rare" items and maybe even server unique items.  Something to encourage people to attend events.  Whats the point if you can get everything in a much easier way.  Natural human instincts to to take the easier path.
---
But your right, sadly.
---
I have a list of wants, but honestly any plan I don't yet know is of interest. I'm in your timezone, so I'll pop in when I see you're online.
---
Ah you sure? I only ever count 8 but then again flatwoods has a lot of foot traffic so maybe you're right.
---
Guess he was too lazy to get his own junk :/ what a jerk...
---
Didn't work for me 
---
There's other people who have already done this and proved that you don't get banned for it. Nobody gets banned for crafting anyone who says otherwise is a cheat... If their happy enough to cheat the game and dupe do you really think they wouldn't lie to try and get unbanned? 
---
Bro then there you go. It’s a game. If you don’t have time to play it, because of responsibilities, how is that mine, this guys, or the games fault? It’s not. That’s on you. The multiple pros to having it be a fresh start outweigh the literal “one” pro you have for it not (which doesn’t really count, as your pro is subjective). As it stands, the game is catering to you right now by allowing. We just happen to think that it shouldn’t. 
---
It’s sopposed to be when ur addicted and goin thru the withdrawals but now that u say this I’m not 100% sure.
---
This has to be one of the most asinine things I've ever read on the internet. 
---
Including YouTube comments. 
---
The evil genius we need 
---
I mean, technically even if they didn't do anything wrong the person still needs to die in order to NOT be wanted, so it's kind of needed regardless.
---
I found amazon to have some base games for $28 USD from bestbuy and Tricent editions for \~$45
---
Fallout hasn't been truly fallout since fallout 2. It has evolved into something else for better or worse. I don't hate the path the games have taken, and I recognize that they are just different games now. They are going to keep on changing until the series dies. My suggestion is that if you don't like Fallout 76, Fallout 4,  Fallout NV or Fallout 3, then stick to playing the ones you like.
---
I do the same thing with Final Fantasy Games. I have been playing since I was 7 years old, and Final Fantasy 4 was my jam on SNES. I went on to love the way the combat evolved with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but once 12 came out with a different battle system I started to like the series less. They keep steering away from traditional battle system, and I don't like it, but that is ok, they don't make the games for me specifically. I play them, if I like them enough I beat them, then I never really go back.
---
All that being said, I love my old game series, but games evolve. I recently just beat Fallout 1 and man I forgot about how bad it felt to finish that game. There was no real winning and I miss that dire and dark feeling of the original fallout games that the new ones don't seem to grasp as well. I recently beat Final Fantasy 15 and thought to myself that I would never play it again, but was happy to experience the story. In the end, I guess it really comes down to what you take away from your experience. If fallout 76 isn't for you, that's ok. Honestly I have my days where I hate the game too.
---
I will be on in ten mins my friend. Another awesome deal coming your way. 
---
I had the same thing happen when the quest marker popped up indicating that I should get the Supply Drop after Bethesda changed the Supply Drop. They used to be for everyone, then it was changed for just the person who requested the drop. That sucked. Luckily I had someone I knew who could just mercy kill me to get the 5 caps.
---
A lot of the assets I want already exist ingame though, so it really isn't that much a workload increase (like the kegs, barrels, racks, etc.)
---
Well I did not try it yet. But I might.  Some youtubers who streamed it at the time, felt like it was a completely different game and added much suspense and intrigue to the game.  It also made him focus on more camping in the woods and paying attention to foods/waters... Where they were just junk before.    So it really changed the game for him.  So if you have already done your 4-5th play through FO4 and want a different experience, that will give it to you.   They did say it was quite annoying to adjust to that initially but once they got the hang of it and recognizing certain foods and recipies, it got very fun.
---
It’s simple... I spend an hour setting up resources in workshops around the map and before I can benefit from all of my hard work I get disconnected from the server or taken over by a much higher ranked OP player... it’s extremely unbalanced and unstable. I love the game, it is just really hard to casually play.
---
Is this still a thing? :(
---
Yeah I found the same ones. I guess it doesn't get any cheaper when it comes to the US.
---
I harvest the cows every day. And I stand corrected, there's 9 Brahmin in Flatwoods. Still, that's makes getting the milk super easy. 
---
GT Lady Rot Roh
---
Oh I hear you. I'm stuck on a biv quest that requires strangler blooms. I've been server hopping for the heart of the swamp event for three days now so that I can get one with no luck.
---
As I understand it, it affects whether you get a mask at all, not the mask you get.
---
I'm probably going to get the specifics slightly wrong, but there are two conditions that govern masks:
---
1. The robots are basically worth 20 points apiece.  If all 5 survive, that's a 100.  If only 2 do, that's 40.  They roll a random number between 0 and 100.  If the random value is less than the sum of the surviving robots, then you will get a mask.  The reason that sometimes no mask is rewarded, despite saving all five robots, is because 0 counts as a number in their random function, which is a silly oversight on their part.
---
2. There is an additional random roll for whether or not a rare mask should be rewarded.  They roll a value between 0 and 1 and check to see if it is &gt;= 1.  This means that to get a rare mask, you need to get a random number to land at exactly 1.  How unlikely that is depends on how many decimal places their random function goes, but we're talking about some odds in the thousands here.
---
You're not wrong that crits are incredibly powerful in PvP, but stealth boys negate VATS entirely. There's other ways around it, but there are certain builds and tactics that are quite broken without the threat of losing aid items on death. You really should drop everything from aid except stims and radaway on death. Stealth boy spam is going to kill the game
---
Not as easily in an open pvp zone.  
---
Alternatively a good thing to note is that fast travel is always free to your own camp OR to vault 76!
---
Mainly liberators and mole miners 
---
Yes I agree, however when they need to come back and restock, the first thing they will do is go for workshops because it’s a fast restock to get the resources they need to go back in to PVP
---
Well there is the pumpkin grenade though that won't solve the issues you outlined in the op. Camps honestly have me less concerned as a nuke should handle those (hopefully you can nuke 76 otherwise this point is moot). I'm more concerned about instances such as getting in the ceiling of the nuke silos. I'm sure that can be done in more spots indoors.
---
Weighing in on people who don't know about a thing advising me, a person who does the thing, on what to do.
---
I work in IT, and I just love when people say "Oh I don't know anything about computers!" in one breath, and then in the next dismiss every suggestion or fix I give them, because their neighbor's 15 year old nephew said it could be done for free. 
---
Mainly liberators and mole miners
---
They have said over and over, crafting won't get you banned. 10,000 bullets doesn't even fall in the range of quantities they have been talking about. And bullets aren't considered rare.
---
Maybe if you made 10,000 ultracite bullets, that might raise some eyebrows. 
---
I don't have much faith in Bethesda making this happen. I can see the modder community doing it though eventually. Although Bethesda has not officially implemented mods, some people use them. It takes a bit of shoehorning to get them setup and they are known to cause bugs in the game after each new patch.
---
Online for trading now.
---
Haha yeah I jumped in an empty server and looked I guess we were both close
---
I'm pretty sure you're right that it's just other players selling the equipment.
---
Yep.
---
It's different if someone who's an actual expert on a topic has a YouTube channel about that topic as a side gig or something.  Lately I've been watching some vocal coaches' channels where they analyze the technique in rock/metal music.  I find that stuff to be interesting and informative.  There's a difference between "expert who happens to have a channel" and "someone who wants to be a professional YouTuber but doesn't have a day job."
---
But I look at these gamer channels and think:  Who cares what he thinks?  What makes him an expert on games?  I've been playing video games for longer than he's been alive.  Is he a professional developer/designer explaining game theory?  Did he get his hands on the uncompiled server-side code, and he's pointing out stuff that we couldn't know otherwise?  Where is his expertise?  
---
Oh, it's just in hosting a channel and getting views?  Yeah, no thanks.  I don't look to Jenny McCarthy for medical information either. 
---
I have zero problem with even full aid drop. That would actually be cool - before each action you would have to think how many of these you should take with you, and thats survivalish.
---
Good post. 
---
The answer really is... if you want the rare mask,  keep doing the event.  Ya gotta pay to play,  friends!
---
I'm enjoying doing the event a couple times per session,  and I love the group mentality of it!
---
Last night at WS I hacked into a ghoul and hit another player by accident and he went red. He one shotted me and I was just gobsmacked because I hadn't taken pacifist off. I checked my settings, yup pacifist was off. I never, ever take it off. It took itself off somehow. Now I check it all the time 
---
I like it, it encourages fun, goofiness, trading and working together (somewhat). I dont even know what the rare masks are, but I have been dropping or vendoring any doubles for your exact reason. In two weeks, it’ll just be stash space
---
It is sad. I know it’ll never happen but taking the PvP aspect out of workshops would be amazing. We already have to battle npc’s while we own it. I farm resources so I can have better builds and be stronger when i run through my missions or battle High level npc’s. I would rather never encounter another player battle. Even if you win the PvP battle you still end up draining so many vital resources... not fun.
---
It's pretty bad as an illustrator. People always offer me 20% of the profits if I do all the work to develop their idea. LOL. 
---
But IT, Lawyers, and Doctors get it way worse. SO MUCH WORSE. 
---
Sadly, there isn't a way to get it back short of trading with another player or starting a new character and finding a way to transfer it to another one.
---
Which is a pretty cruel joke when you consider that "Scrap a piece of Responders equipment" is a common Daily challenge.
---
I had 2 nuked yesterday just as I was starting to play.  Stuck around to see what happened for the first one (reset the parade timer, so I didn't wait around to see), bailed on the second one.
---
The nice thing was that for the rest for the evening, finding active parades wasn't hard.  The day before it was pretty bleak, had to jump around a lot to find one that was active, but yesterday only a hop or two before I found one.
---
Agreed. Unless it's just play normally like I'm worried about. That means the drop rate is duper low. 
---
When i was level 3 an high level gave to me 15 purified waters...for me a gold mine lol, now i'm 57 and even if i'm not so high and have few time to play i try to return the favor to others. Got a small "village" moving around (actually near Watoga) with separate building with workshops and hotel, adhesive farm and water purifiers open to everyone. I just have a little locked building for me just for some privacy lol 
---
Pleasure.
---
I'd rather there just be a warning for characters under level 50 suggesting they level up in adventure before going into survival mode. Give the masochists that want to join as a level two the option to do so but explain bluntly that they are fodder. J think splitting the player base any further than the two game modes is a mistake.
---
Exactly, this is what the event is about. Go have some fun. Maybe you will get really lucky. 
---
Stop building your life around owning digital items. 
---
RNG will be RNG 
---
Had a guy last night using racial slurs and calling women bit** etc. I think every single person at the parade reported him right then and there 
---
Mine was never destroyed lol
---
This would be great because then people wouldn't get away with destroying my entire camp while other people get killed and looted by accidentally clipping something else. 
---
I also second the "Pardon" option for the owner of the camp, or even have something pop up that asks if you want to set a bounty for the player after they hurt your camp?
---
What would be really cool is if it asked, and if you said no the person got to go free, and if you said yes, then you can fill out a small note of WHY the person should be taken down and also offer the option to add your own caps to the bounty price if desired.
---
I will be in artisans corner in hotel if you want to trade for next half hr 
---
I should be able to help you out. I have no Violet Flux or Coal at the moment so Chameleon, Plague Walker and Scaly Skin could be hit or miss depending on how the day goes. But bring the flux and materials you do have and I'll see what I can do.
---
They won't, that's like shooting your foot.
---
J currently have 32k 556, 15k308 and 27k 45... you wont get banned 
---
Under my scenario the outcome you experienced would fit. Everyone at the event pulls from the same loot table.  So you would get whatever everyone else gets at the event with rng of course. The only way a rare might pop up is if someone is accidentally doing the turn ins perfectly and then it would change either the loot table or the % chances on the loot table for the whole group. 
---
It’s a different terminal 
---
Sounds good.  Look forward to having you stop by.
---
They already did. They are very rare. Run the event to get a chance. That's it. That's all you need to know and what to do. There's not cheat code or special thing you can do. Save show up and have fun. 
---
Not sure quick and fallout can be said in te same sentence :)
---
I've got about 180 hrs in to get to L44. 
---
But I don't fast travel, and I tend to explore every nook and cranny..
---
Following the overseers quest line will give you the backstory on the realm (to understand why you are doing what you are doing), give you level appropriate enemies, and help build your character.
---
  Teaming up may also help, in that you can get XP faster.  Do events in the forest, lather, rinse, repeat.  
---
  Leaving forest and toxic valley too early will put you in areas with higher level enemies - which give more XP, but until about L20, you will die frequently if you go to far east or south.
---
  Make sure you check the map when you hear the warning about a nuke - verify you are not in the zone - if you are, you'll likely die in the initial blast, or the rads will get you in a hurry.
---
Loot your enemies, scrap everything for mods, mats, and XP.   
---
It is low. They told us that. You already know what to do. 
---
Thats what im understanding now. I found an old sub on someone explaining the process. Which makes me wonder more how i found the plan on the floor lol. 
---
That’s not how statistics work...
---
That isn't working. 
---
&gt; You wont loose any meaningful items in F76 due to PvP, unlike you would  in ARK or Rust. Its junk and aid, nothing else. Comparing full loot drop  game to partial loot drop game is indeed irrelevant, because these two  games are fundamentally different. 
---
And yet you complain about the time it will take to regrind to get a quad explosive harpoon gun.  
---
&gt;  The point with quad explosive harpoon was that you just can't go  somewhere where quad explosive harpoons drop and farm it for ten  eternities until you got the perfect one, as its not how the game is  designed.  
---
Yes and everyone will have the same chance so your argument means absolutely jack shit.  Even if it dropped from Mirelurk Queens only high level players would be able to farm for it anyways. Which means your entire argument is undermined by how the game works.  
---
Everyone has the same equal chance to get the weapon. That is the definition of fair in PvP. 
---
&gt; Don't shove item examples out of your ass, look at the actual game, what are its mechanics, and what the consequences will be. 
---
I do you are literally saying that everyone having the same chance to get an item isn't fair. You ignore that non legendary weapons are more then capable of killing other players.  Particularly since they will be adjusting the game damage to specifically prevent instant kills.   
---
More then likely there will be a cap to the amount of damage that can be done. In Mass Effect 3 we called this a shield gate because no matter how powerful you made your gun you would never do any more damage then just enough to pop the shield of the enemy targeted.  Which would mean a lever action rifle would be just as effective as a quad explosive harpoon gun for PvP.  For PvE the harpoon gun would still be better in some cases but no PvP which is the primary focus of this game mode.
---
I’ve been looking for this info. 
---
I Can’t find recipe info anywhere. 
---
&gt; Level scaling won’t do jack if a group of 2-4 roll in with matching sentinel/cavalier armor,
---
Okay so you are moving goalposts now. The main argument was that people just starting out would have an unfair disadvantage. That's the only one that anyone can really agree upon. Level scaling fixes THAT ONE.
---
Nothing fixes groups vs single, nor does groups vs single  have anything to do with whether or not we should be able to move our characters between modes, which is all this is about.
---
Agreed!  I really dont think it will even launch well.  People will go there for an hour and then go back to adventure mode once they realize its just who sees who first.   1 shot TSEs or BDCs
---
People will use assassin's sentinel of course, others will stagger them and 1 shot.  Its just a matter of who presses the button faster.  There will be little to no quests or exploration being done.   But if characters had to born on the server? Different story... Lots of incentive to get quests done, gives rewards and xp for leveling.
---
True like the mag you were using not your entire load lol.
---
Ok I'm glad you know it's broken. Can you provide a verifiable link for that information? 
---
Come now, you cannot see the comedy of 20 people in blue suits all punching each other while scrabbling to get away and hide in the forests?
---
Or two people ducking behind trees shooting their little 10 mm pistol at each other.
---
I bet those fights are much funner than someone coming up to you and TSE to the face.  You are down.
---
What's wrong by sharing an awsome sub to a friendly player ? I never tell him to quit this sub or something ....
---
Good one, I was going to suggest that.
---
Statistics work by people adjusting the numbers in their favor to convince another party that their view is correct. That's how they work.  Happens every day in my job.
---
If you watch the twitch stream that shows the community managers talking to the devs about the faschnaut event you can see that these masks were intended to drop. These drop rates are clearly not working as intended from what WE KNOW. No responses or clarification from Bethesda leads us to this conclusion. So many of us wanted to grind for those rare masks. We are just disappointed.
---
I believe that they are for sale from the vendorbot in Harpers Ferry, but depending on what platform you are on (I'm on xbox) I might have a plan for them as well and I will undersell any vendorbot.
---
I had a similar problem. I had so many quests it was covering some of my HUD. 
---
"Bethesda pls call me"
---
Keep up the good work, man.
---
You could consider statistics to work that way. Numbers can always be viewed through a different lens. The issue here is that your odds do not improve each time you run the event and do not get a rare mask. It remains the same.
---
&gt; These drop rates are clearly not working as intended from what WE KNOW.
---
Only, you don't actually know anything. You are using your lack of any evidence to say that proves you are right. Yet people have gotten masks. 
---
They have responded to people's conclusions, and people just don't want to accept what they are told, because they feel they are owed this. 
---
And they tell them months before an update too.
---
Tell that to the lovely developers who purposely didn't put in push-to-talk at launch. Just because it's their job doesn't mean they are always right.
---
Not so much 'cooperating' as 'allowing'.  It's Sony's thing, to stand in the way of people having fun.
---
I agree to an extent with the controller vs. mouse thing, though other games don't have an issue with it.  Might be an issue in PvP, but for regular gameplay mixing the 2 shouldn't really be an issue.
---
Like addictions and junkie's weapons? Like how mutations and strange in numbers just keep rotating on how they're broken? Herd mentality, magnetic personality, and unyielding armor all sever shared perk cards after a minute at most. Or are we talking about how armor pen and anti-armor doesn't apply to energy and rad damage? 
---
There's still plenty wrong with the game.
---
It removes every one that you choose to de-select! :)
---
Thats a great phrase! 
---
That's not the same thing. But nice try, and thanks for playing. We don't have a part gift for you, because the RNG is too low for you win anything. 
---
this dumbass OP should be against the rules. It does nothing for anything.
---
Yay!!
---
I just bought 76 off Amazon, used for $18. That's probably your best bet. 
---
I don't understand the thought process behind contesting me on this issue. I'm a part of many fallout 76 communities and play with a lot of people and I know ONE woman who had the sun mask. As far as I've seen, she's the only person who has a rare mask. That's across all platforms. Show me 10 more people who have rare Fasnacht masks, and I'll take this down and move on. 
---
I don't think people are angry, just voicing their 2 cents, but I believe the event is amazing due to actually seeing a large number of people for the firs time 
---
Unlike you, they are capable in phrasing things in a way that isn't rude.
---
just keep scrapping you get it eventually, if you wanna hunt pipe guns down Morgantown airport and railroad generally have a pretty healthy amount of scorched with them in my experience 
---
There's a survival server next week. Now go play in that kids sandbox.
---
That is a good idea but due keep in mind as most online games do this, they may more than likely have it next year too. Events may be up for limited time but based on popularity they will do it again next year.
---
SUPER GREAT POST, OP.
---
I love this event, and I can tell a lot of other players do as well. When I was on last night, I pretty much stayed in Helvetia the entire time to wait for the event. Not the whole time, obviously, but a great deal of it I spent there waiting, and I wasn't the only one! We always had a LOT of people show up for it, wearing the mask or beret that they've gotten already, and we all had fun. I especially loved watching everyone running up ahead to wait and kill the suiciders that spawn. It's such a fun event, and I love how it brings people together. Bethesda did well with it :)
---
Yes we know nothing. Nothing. I have done the event 60+ times. No rare masks. Maybe these masks will drop on the weekend. Maybe they only drop at a specific time. Maybe the do not drop at all. The point is, we have NO clue because no response. Any response would be better than none 
---
Made me laugh out loud at work
---
Inconceivably low. When they announced this event they used the words "some masks will be exceedingly rare", which is fine. But at this rate, 5 people across all three platforms will have rare masks before the event ends. That isn't acceptable. 
---
Maybe Bethesda said to themselves: "Maybe all the pvp hungry annoying people will just transfer their characters to PVP mode and leave our Adventurer players alone".  Some might like that but I feel it would be better to let people start on the same level of playing field and not being in all those high level weapon from the start.
---
&gt;where is the problem?
---
PvP isn't bad, PvP is dead. I'm sure many are rejoicing, and some even pretending to like PvP in an attempt to shield the game from any change that might improve PvP because they hate it that much.
---
LOL. How entitled of you. By the way, questioning why I would contest you on this issue. That's exactly what entitlement is. You believe you are right. You have no facts or evidence to support your belief. 
---
So you know someone that has a mask. So it's not broken. 
---
By your OWN WORDS, it's working. Rare masks are possible to get.
---
Thanks for playing, we'd give you a parting gift, but the computer RNG said No. 
---
I bought it used from Amazon for $18.
---
No link since it got caught in the automod filter, but I just looked as some are right around that price point if you don't mind waiting for a physical disc.
---
That’s the very definition of rare. Smh
---
PS4 here unfortunately! but thanks, will give him a check
---
Really only semi serious. I still love FO76, this is one event for only a week. Just frustrated with the "all or nothing" aspect of the event. 
---
I'll just go back to running Forest events for the Forest Camo lol.
---
I've played games with RNG and rare items before. This is something else. Not so much rare as it is nearly impossible. 
---
It's either that or just change how they work. Make it so if you shoot or attack anything the stealth field drops. They cost over 100 caps, so you better kill someone over level 100 so you break even.
---
Exactly.  
---
You know I watched several of those "voice experts" as well and seems they are starting to get some of the "self proclaimed experts" too.   One posted a reaction video about Disturbed's cover of Sound Of Silence.   I am guessing she had no clue this group was a 20 year veteran group of platinum selling artists and started critiquing his "technique".  She got blasted by thousands upon thousands of comments...  I had to add my own little poke in there too!   
---
I wish higher level people would let lower levels at least tag the sloth. A three star showed up at the Fastnacht I ran last night and none of the lower levels was able to tag the sloth before the higher levels had gangbanged it to death. 
---
With green thumb, I got about 130 in about 30 mins, I could have gotten more but... got close to being encumbered so quit.
---
It depends on how many people are looking as well. I was only one there.  (I think?) I don't think you can loot a plant after someone else does?
---
Calling the devs liars and other such comments sound like angry people to me. I mean, I seldom make a post with caps, and use words like Bullshit, and this is fucking ridiculous when I'm not angry. 
---
The possibilities: 
---
1. If it is true that the rare masks are tied to not allowing some robots to live, how can you expect the community to co-ordinate in such a way?
---
Private servers are not available and the amount of people participating in these events average between 5 - 10 people at a time. Teamwork of this level is not possible with what is available.
---
2. If the rare mask drop rate is just extraordinarily low. Lets put it this way: ITS TOO LOW. This possibility is evil. 
---
3. If noone is receiving the "rare masks" due to a bug: FIX IT.
---
4. I really hope that the reason noone is receiving the "rare masks" is for this: Bethesda is deliberately withholding them for a later date. This makes sense and would almost make fools out of people like me who've been grinding at the game to keep our options open.
---
Obviously we would find out sooner or later, but some clarity/transparency on this would be a NICE THING TO DO, given that the community is under pressure because this event will eventually end.
---
I’ve only been addicted one time. The chance is super low for some reason. But after the effect of the chem wears off, you’ll get the junkies buff. 
---
Idk if you can have multiple addictions, as mine was only from a beer. But it made my Gatling gun go from 144 to 159 per shot
---
Wuff! Great job!
---
yeah okay not a full deck you're playing with clearly.
---
I know what you mean. 
---
no joy, still on the hunt. thanks though!
---
Yes it is. These masks are Rare not "rare".
---
Glad to hear that!
---
I've only been to Lewisburg a couple times - first time in the teens, I got swarmed by mid level mutants with sledges and 38s... and a wendigo.  
---
  Second time in the low 30s in T45 power armor, again swarms of mutants - this time they had full auto assault weapons.  (where swarm = 8 or more at once)
---
Never made it more than a few paces beyond the respawn point on the edge of town.
---
Thought I would never get out of there....and I still haven't been back to complete that part of the quest.
---
Have Super Duper and Ammo Smith equipped I craft between 4-6k 5mm at a time and no problems yet I have over 20k 5mm.
---
I think everyone is missing the point on what survival mode actually is.. if you've ever played a MMO, then you've at least dabbled in PvP. Every MMO allows you to swap from PVE to PvP with the same characters. There's certain abilities and gear that are superior for PvP builds, and certain gear good for PVE. 76 is a little different, but it's the same premise. 
---
If you want everyone to have a fresh start, then you're still going to have people who grind to 50 in the first 2 days. There will always be people much much more powerful than you. That's the point of any game that requires you to grind for the best equipment. Within 2 months you'd have the same issue, new players jumping into survivor mode and bitching that they're not powerful..
---
This isn't call of duty. There isn't, and will never be, an equal playing field. 
---
I'm going to take such great pleasure in hunting you all. 
---
I'm not entitled to anything. Some people should be receiving rare mask, doesn't have to be me. It's not working if one person across 3 platforms since Tuesday has received one. 
---
Yes. Rad would be good.  Not going to be overpower unless you are afk and need active rad away. 
---
No they do not improve with each run, when comparing them back to back sure.
---
But if you Throw 1000 pennies off a building at a manhole, you got a much greater chance of landing one of those than throwing a single penny.
---
it deals with the number of chances you got to make that random roll.  
---
So yes, its not "guaranteed" but its significantly increased.
---
Can you use a camp there?
---
God forbid if people want something else out of the event than just fun, and any event loses it's fun factor when the rewards become ever so diminishing. The only rare hat I've seen a few times along with other people is the Fashnact Barrette, and I haven't seen anyone wearing any of the other rare masks after doing this 40 times. No one cares that it's rare, but how INSANELY rare they seem to be. Not everyone cares about bragging rights either, plenty of people just want things for the sake of having it, especially if it's rare and requires a lot of time to get. Or if they do want to brag about it, they likely only wan to do so amongst their friends (I don't mind bragging a little, but I could care less about bragging amongst strangers). People like goals to work towards, and so far the goal of obtaining all or even most of the rare masks seems impossible, and with a time limit of 1 week, that's just an egregiously stingy drop chance. These aren't rare. These are borderline mythical.
---
Thank you for ruining the rest of my day with...
---
LOL, I couldn't finish it. Oh no! I have been insulted by someone on reddit!
---
Tl;dr
---
Have fun with the event. It’s a game. Don’t be a dick
---
a... a lot of brahmin were harmed... like... a lot
---
I'm not actually against them working as they do now. There's a scrissor for every paper and a paper for every rock.
---
... profound. 
---
currently holding 150k 5mm, still going up ..
---
all looted from super mutants
---
Sad they didn't put anything up there as a reward for players that make it that far. Bethesda is usually good at things like that.
---
I'm at well over 100 runs and I've given up. The drops are so low and less and less people are showing up. If the chance was higher I would still be going because I like grinding. But this grind is completely unrewarding and I have a pretty good chance to not ever get one even with all the grinding. 
---
*insert 'why do i hear boss music?' image here*
---
It's worth it. Some fun lore, more crafting recipes, \~\~get addicted to Alcohol\~\~ try some new things!
---
They don't fly as far if they're alive... I kill them so they're more aerodynamic
---
My friend, keep on keeping on. Thanks for taking the time to post something positive. May your Fusion Cores be 100/100, and your SBQ never stop taking damage at 72%. 
---
The point of that weapon was to be smoke to non-afkers and a weapon against afkers.
---
\&gt; But Fasnacht will most likely be a yearly event.  
---
So one more before servers go offline?
---
Everyone I know who has a full set of sentinel assassins armor has the exact same set, still available on ebay for 50 bucks. I have a set I traded mats for, checked it against everyone else's, they're all the same set 
---
I hit the sloth ONCE, then back away. Everyone should get a shot.
---
Last night we had a douchebag running around with a Fatman. Smdh
---
But you are essentially throwing one penny off at a time, with each toss being the same odds. They do not increase with each toss.
---
I still don't know why they didn't include a summary confirmation for transactions netween players. It seems like such a simple fix that would alleviate a lot of the trading anxiety.
---
Don't know why you were downvoted, this should be the top post. It smells like spoiled brat in here. 
---
A rare drop should well and truly feel *rare*, timed event or not. There's nary any bragging rights or coolness factor about a mask that anyone with an hour or two of spare time to run the event over and over again can aquire, yet it's gotta feel pretty great to be one person out of tens of thousands to run the event once or twice and recieve a rare mask from it. Such is the way of a *rare* drop.
---
I’ve been able to only do it once. It was awesome. We had like 15 people. It was freaking crazy. It was a lot of fun and I ended up getting the “Party in the Back” mask.
---
God forbid, having fun is the main reason for doing something! 
---
I feel bad for anyone that hangs their self esteem on owning a digital item in a digital world that they will forget about in a few weeks after getting it.
---
Hopefully you will get your star belly someday. 
---
100% agree 
---
and while you are at it, craft a load of leather and scrap those until you get studded mod.
---
Valid point is valid...🤔
---
LOl, party in the back. 
---
Also, im not asking for a cheat or a code. You're making things up that have nothing to do with this. 
---
I don't mean to sound insenstive but this person has clearly been dead a while given the desicated appearance.  I really don't suggest holding their corpse like that.
---
Kinda wish **all** dailies (including Vendor Caps) reset at the same time. Would make it easier for me to just do stuff when I wanted, rather than "Shit, it's late, if I do this now, I won't be able to do it until (now) tomorrow."
---
Blocker, Fireproof, Serendipity, Nerd Rage, and Dodgy make you unbelievably tanky. Also, with Psychobuff on top of that, I hardly ever die.
---
I played Brahmin Toss with a lot of randoms while I was making this and they were all able to see/launch the bodies
---
Another happy customer and another cheap sale on a bloodied pitchfork. 
---
You know where to come..PS4 and pirateglenn1...add me people for top deals.
---
Maturity like your's is like a fasnacht rare mask. An illusion. 
---
do you have the bonfire, i need 2 ?  :)
---
A level 400 player simple means 800 caps for my wallet. Y'all are freaking out over nothing.
---
Sorry. 
---
Oh and don't by any plans from vendors unless you want to waste tons of caps only to discover you already owned that plan...
---
Oh wait, they patched that finally, only the earlier FO76 gen got screwed.
---
&gt;Stop building your life around owning digital items.
---
Ironically we have built an entire society around digital electronic dollars that are traded by AI back and forth for scraps of digital paper 
---
I saw them at Harpers ferry and watoga
---
Does it flag them as wanted?
---
I did an event and there were Scortched Concorer (sp) and irradiated flowers - same mask results, however I did not poll the entire group. However no one put on a "rare" (aka impossible) mask ;)
---
I've run Fasnacht several times, I enjoy it. 100% agree with the absurdity of people becoming so angry over such a small thing. 
---
LOL. Maybe we need to make some Wastelands colloquialisms. 
---
May your travels be Mole rat free. Whos' got some?
---
That makes me sad...
---
I've been saving up to buy the Marsupial plan but this is a pretty amazing charity you're running. Thank you for your service!
---
It’s been fun!
---
programing is only giving the developer the ability to provide you an environment. it is still the individual player that is defining how he is using this environment. some player might never see any bugs based on the way the play within the environment and others might see one bug after the other.
---
you choose to be the audience or the actor when you play.
---
on another note. my example was not related to bugs in games. it was related to majorities and minorities beeing part of the same event and having fundamentally different experiences.
---
Not me. I built my life around experiences. Yes some of them are digital. Like this parade. I have fun. I don't care about how rare some of the masks are. 
---
&gt;Donut recipe
---
ok, pm'd you about the  Donut recipe ...
---
You wait until April 9th like everyone else
---
That would be great. 
---
I want windowed brick half-walls! 
---
They're not in the game yet. Coming next month, check the roadmap. 
---
Thanks for this! I saw a cat in the Ash Heap region the other day and wished I had had that perk.
---
Sadly no. :(  Get 1 at a time and turn that one in before picking up another.  Otherwise your 2 technical data turn into 1.  There is a bug where they stack before you go through the BoS quest line.  If you have them on your inventory and turn them in, it acts as only 1 technical data however.  I stored my data in my stash before I did the BoS quest line.  When I took them out, they all turned into 1 technical data.  I was so bummed.  I had 19 saved up.
---
It goes great with my Greaser outfit. 
---
Just hand him a Pickaxe Pilsner and the quest is done (and you still have the recipe).
---
Personally I only pick as many as I can stabilize but I’ve had a friend pull over 180 out of fissure prime with green thumb of course.
---
Oh that’s weird. I got a daily challenge to sell an item to another player through the vending machine. 
---
Sorry for the crappy post!
---
But level 5000 will lose 10k caps on death and level 50 will loose 0.1k caps.
---
Hence, if I were level 5000 (lol) player, I'd prefer to play on a server where the people are similarly high.
---
Dances would be super cool.
---
With all the cigarettes and cigars in the game smoking would be cool, but I doubt the govt would let us have that kind of fun in a game world.
---
Perk loadouts and event timers on the world map are the two QOL changes I most desire. 
---
Yeah I climbed to this super high mountain in the savage divide via marsupial (before the enclave quest locked me in a rad spray chamber and sprayed me. I’ll never forget the feeling of sad hopelessness as I got locked in a hallway and forced to loose the best mutation in the game) and there was a panda and something else
---
I've done it 50 or 60 times too and that's the only plan I haven't gotten yet. 
---
Stop trying to delegitimize the people who want those rare masks by saying that it’s a “digital item in a digital world”. We just want to be able to have them. Again, if you watch that twitch stream, these rare masks were actually talked about by the devs. The rare masks were intended to actually drop, and if they are dropping then the rate is not high enough 
---
No problem mate
---
I feel bad for anyone that hangs their self esteem on owning a digital item 
---
In what world does this have to do with self esteem...? Have you convinced yourself that there's literally no other possible reason? People have different ideas of fun and satisfaction. I guess you're simply not capable of understanding that.
---
  If you are not interested in PvP, best best is make sure you have pacifist on, and server hop as soon as you relize you are under attack.
---
Sometimes they'll chase, but at least hopping (can) save your stuff.
---
Since it takes a bit of time for them to follow on a server hop, if you recalled thier name(s) once your screen loads, open the map, R2, and the block function is in there somewhere.
---
Just want to say that I got bored of FO76 quite quickly &amp; moved onto other games. I have subsequently come back and I'm loving the game. I'm level 90 and have yet to launch a nuke, so if anyone on PS4 fancies helping me out that would be great. 
---
Which is always the down side anytime you do all inclusive things, even in real life. The trick is to gird your loins and not let them get to under your skin. 
---
I'm happy with my three common masks and I think it's silly to be angry, but I think you're too dismissive of the information we have. 
---
Careful observation can achieve remarkable statistical power and accurate probability predictions out of a pretty limited number of trials. The combination of  rigorous testing by individuals and our case reports make it **probable that the rare masks are exceedingly rare**. 
---
Even as someone who doesn't care much about getting a rare mask, these masks are so rare that I don't even seem others wearing them at the event. That seems like a missed opportunity.   
---
What behavior Bethesda is trying to encourage? How many times does Bethesda want the average rare-mask seeker to run the event? Is the probability right to achieve their goals? 
---
Lastly, I think it's worth mentioning the game's history of bugs. At what low-probability does the developer risk players perceiving this as yet-another-broken-feature, even if it's merely a properly-working-but-rare-drop? I hate to cater to a mob, but when you have a history of transgressions, you really have to keep your nose clean to repair your reputation. 
---
do a trade with someone, that should do the trick
---
I'm tired of these posts acting like it's somehow our responsibility to convince people to play the game or justify why we play it...
---
Haha, that's awesome! Tell your nephew I said hi!
---
May have already been bought on that server is my guess.  Agree with below that it might be for sale at one of the Watoga vendors as well.
---
Thanks for being such a polite and friendly player! Wish more people were like you. It was the first time I had ever seen the sloth spawn (does it get misty and foggy in the surronding environs everytime it does?). I was like "Oh!" and then 10 seconds later it was dead and I was like "Oh."
---
The strangest part is the most difficult fight of the whole event is when the sloth appears, but isn't the sloth. The wolves and stingwings spawn in close, fast, and will take down bots. Ironically, this mucks with the mask drop rates. The high levels need to cover the swarm , and let the noobs hold the sloth until the swarm is cooked. Same for the suiciders, the high levels need to engage far away from the parade, absorb the agro and damage and let the noobs deal with the skirmishers. 
---
I have done the parade over 8 times. Got a non glitched sloth only 2 times.
---
Well, I was in photo mode sitting on top of the bonfire like a douche when I headed that all too familiar whistle of a mini nuke coming down.  So, I rushed out of photo mode and leaped for my life.  It was funny to me because I was being a dick myself...irony of the whole thing.
---
My pc can run it, but no video card yet. So i play on xbox, the land of no mods.
---
I've heard (but can't verify) if you server hop, it may not be destroyed on the new server....
---
I've had similar ideas. Like what if we could go into builder mode, and take various elements to construct how pieces of camp would look. Like why can't my walls look barn outside, but drywall inside? 
---
Nah they don't work... I tried a bunch of stuff with land mines and explosive bait too but couldn't get anything interesting to happen.
---
Mine have been spawning behind me when I drop items onto the ground with a short delay after i close my pip boy.
---
It was introduced in Fallout 4 in the Underground Railroad (as in smuggling slaves to freedom) quest line. 
---
May your Logs Always Be Harvestable and Your Purifiers Always Full? :D
---
Yeah. Shopping cart for shopping cart, with a lock-and-confirm function to avoid switching shenanigans. We can hope. 
---
Yes. You won't see a hit marker, but you will hear the sound effect. It will eventually explode with bloody mess.
---
Did this event last night on Xbox at level 25 with a level 8, nobody else showed up. We made it until the legendary sloth showed up and all the wolves destroyed the robots and it took so much ammo to kill the sloth lol. After that the level 8 said goodbye and went to his camp nearby he was starting to build, so I followed and gave him a hazmat suit, 25+ recipes, a bunch of purified water, etc. I guess I am saying, I appreciate all the help from high levels and people with good gear and weapons.
---
I would say the majority of them never played. One great way to tell is when they mention that it's a pay-to-win game.
---
Haven't tried building there yet but was wondering how close you could put a C.A.M.P.
---
pls
---
You're my new favorite person 
---
I like it.
---
If you don't have pacifist enabled they can run in front of your shots to make you wanted. It's the only legitimate way outside of workshop contesting I can think of to force you into pvp.
---
Mark III Stealth boys and related perk can make you invisible for 6 minutes at a time.
---
I agree it's an RPG series but for me the RPG aspects are reaching that level where you have all the perks you want. I'm (currently lvl 40) I have another 10 levels before my Stealth/Sniper build is complete I'm focusing on obtaining the perk cards that deal damage, and the utility cards that complement damage and stealth first. I then have another 25 to 30 levels to get all the crafting/utility cards I want to be able to craft exceptional armor and weapons and camps. 
---
SO when I'm perfect, I'll be Lvl 75 - 80, thats a lot of RPGing and you still have to make a conscious choices on your loadouts and how you play the game at lower levels. 
---
Yes, especially since since that particular loot is so random. I don't how the sloth levels its drops, but with the mix of player levels that's always in that event for me, i've never gotten anything that i didn't immediately paper bag on the street right there.
---
There is a tactic I've encountered where the only counter is the exact same build, weapons/armor, and same tactic. If you encounter someone with a stealth boy using a medium range weapon that shreds anyone with the best damage mitigation with 100% hit probability without the assistance of VATS, then there isn't much a counter. You can't take them at distance very well because they're invisible and even with 30 perception their arrow drops off. You can't rely on area of effect weapons because everyone's running dense and fireproof. The only thing you can do is employ the same tactic. I used to think there was a lot of balance in PvP as long as you learned the mechanics, but with 4 round-15 person hunter v hunted match it seemed like the only counter to this build was people using nearly the same build. 
---
Can u dm me the link thx
---
Maybe they drop when you are solo'ing the event. Has anyone tried that?
---
Figures the jester is the one I wanted and it’s a rare 
---
you sir are a dick, downvoted.
---
Nothing in the atom shop has been obtainable ingame, and vice versa. There isn't one example of this.
---
I can be in a full group use escape artist against a queen and have every melee attack is hidden 
---
Have you checked the Whitespring vendors inside the resort? I don't know that I've seen those specific ones there, but the resort robots had lots of the furniture I was missing. 
---
Oh, it's like, it's like whole generations of those things have died at my hands, and... mothers, fathers, grandfathers, little baby brahmin. (scoffs)
---
Yeah I was busy taking out the wolves and bugs and was wondering why only the other lower level was helping me (I was 59 and they were 38). All the higher levels were killing the sloth. If it always spawns opposite the church entrance in will hang out there and hopefully get a hit in next time.
---
Plenty of people have tried soloing the event but if they drop from that then why bother? It’s supposed to be a event that most of the server shows up for. We just do not know.
---
I don’t know if there was a change but I just ran it and the mutants were all level 68 this time and there was a ton of them. 
---
There was only a few of us. First time I’ve seen it get failed. Maybe if you find one of those it has better drops. 
---
Did you shoot back? How did you get cap farmed?
---
Thrre's a delay they put in that seems to be related to the "fix" for bags not spawning. You have to stand still for a second after you leave your pip boy. Look down and you'll see it appear.
---
I laughed so hard at all the conspiracy theorists yesterday when the moon mask was in the Atom Shop...
---
Well, they did say that it would be available.......... LOL
---
&gt; Careful observation can achieve remarkable statistical power and accurate probability predictions out of a pretty limited number of trials. The combination of rigorous testing by individuals and our case reports make it probable that the rare masks are exceedingly rare.
---
Only, we haven't had any careful observation. That one poll someone did was based on unverifiable data. 
---
We have already had confirmation from Bethesda that the rare masks are indeed very rare. So the people that made the game have told us that fact. How rare, well, they aren't going to give us numbers, and they shouldn't. 
---
It showed at my last parade too. It called me a coward for entering Vault 76 when the nukes fell, turn back and went up the road. I hope it comes back again for real insults and will not kill him intentionally until Fallout Philly.
---
I still want some of the masks and I’m gonna try to get some but it’s not worth being sad or upset about, I wish more people cared more for what fasnacht is about, celebrating the end of winter and spending time with friends and family. It’s asinine people are more worried about masks than celebrating the end of the metaphorical winter fallout 76 has experienced and the beginning of its new age of content.
---
Can you craft stealth boy III?
---
i am im at work, and my ps4 is at home :(
---
Hmm... someone might have nuked Helvetia earlier in that server's life? Interesting. 
---
Cooking oil is all over the place.  Look for kitchens and especially diners.  For example, the diner in Watoga spawns it.
---
Just don't scrap all...
---
Doesn't say anything about the vending machine in the challenge
---
&gt; I especially loved watching everyone running up ahead to wait and kill the suiciders that spawn.
---
No need to run around, actually. I'm the one that always sits atop the photo wall and V.A.T.S. one-shots the suiciders from that vantage point. With  a pistol.
---
People have now taken to running to the forest to get the sloth before he even gets near the town. The last 3 runs I did thought there was no sloth till I found his dead body behind the candle maker building. 
---
It’s s huge bummer when one guy goes off and takes it alone.
---
I agree that this isn't necessarily what the event is about, but the reason that most people are doing it more than a few times is because they are after the prizes.  I absolutely had a blast the first few times and then it is the exact same thing over and over with absolutely no challenge.  I literally would have no trouble doing the event alone and out of the 50 or so times that I've run it I haven't seen a robot die.  I have no idea how people are having that happen with the groups that I've been seeing.  The event was light hearted and fun though and that is what I enjoyed about it.  I would love to see more things like this added.
---
I disagree that the whole survey post shows nothing.  It shows that a ton of people are doing the event a bunch of times and not even seeing anyone with a rare mask, let alone getting one.  If that is the way it is intended I'd say that I feel like time was wasted even creating the things as I am not expecting to even see one in the game.
---
Bethesda could do a lot better at communication if there is anything to the drop rates changing as the week goes on.  The reason that we know nothing is because we are told nothing, so it would be silly to assume that the event is going to change at all as the week goes on.
---
I get the point of your post though and agree with a lot of it, however I don't fault people in a game like this for wanting to collect loot.  How rare is too rare is a subject for debate.  I personally think that if someone is grinding the event all week long that they should have a realistic chance of getting one of the rare masks.
---
The people that were on a team in the workshop got cap farmed. I wasn’t on the team, was just there and got one-shotted several times but still no “Wanted” notification for any of the attackers. 
---
I understand owning the workshop immediately throws you into PVP. Does just being there and not on a team do the same?
---
The easiest way to gain an addiction is to alternate between two chems...pop one, leave pip boy menu, go back into pip boy menu, repeat...in my exp it takes about 5 chems to gain the addiction, you HAVE to alternate b/c chems don’t stack, and popping a bunch in a row just wastes chems
---
I think in most cases it's less about "we demand the item because we played the event" and more a series of steps that frustrate many players.
---
Someone datamined the event and seemed to discover that the chance of getting a mask might be the closest thing to a statistical zero percent chance because of buggy/poor code rather than an intended effect. "We think they meant to do *this* but really this is what's happening" 
---
A poll was run and seems to validate the datamining. The issue is raised with Bethesda and they say "no everything is fine" but did they actually check or just assume?
---
There's a huge difference between "we looked at the code, tested it and realize the drop rate is correct/incorrect, working as intended/sorry about that" and "checked the code, item is in it and the condition is theoretically possible for it to drop, item is therefore dropping as intended"
---
We know Bethesda is capable of making these mistakes (recall the issue with fusion core production dropping from 12 to .8 rather than 8.0, for example) and that's the big issue with faschnacht right now for some players: did Bethesda screw up or is the rate intended to be what it is. If they screwed up they might fix it and therefore there's a valid reason to complain (for those who actually want the hat) so there's merit to being vocal. If they really wanted the hats to be one in a hundred thousand, then us being loud hopefully helps shape their decisions in the future. 
---
There are countless studies showing that success in video games is tied to a person's self esteem. You are talking to me on the internet, so please google for those studies. Because no I will not post links. You are able to use the internet, so I expect you to be able to find things yourself. 
---
No. Maybe if you're making 100,000 at a time. You're not the only one making thousands of ammo at a time, they will not ban you for it.
---
It's been rolling in corpses like a dog.
---
Just a tip, as it sounds like you might be spending more time than necessary taking them all off and back on..
---
If you go into your wheel and go to the slot, you can just assign it from there by hitting 'Change'.  
---
Thought this might help if you didn't already know.
---
There's nothing wrong with wanting it. The tantrums are getting old, though. They are rare. That means sometimes, you won't get them. At all. EVER. To say the drop rate is too low, means you've decided the threshhold, and  the devs must be wrong. In the 400+ hours I've played, I haven't gotten a single explosive anything. I've purchased several from folks luckier than I am. I've never once posted complaining that legendaries don't drop enough of what I want.
---
juicehead is useless, he recycles reddit posts and people believe him and repeat him like a parrot, his whole shtick is controversy, nothing constructive or creative.
---
People have forgotten what the term 'rare' means. Masks are not rare if everyone has one. People are upset that the "average" player can't get one. Well yes... that's the point. It's going to be a badge of honor that you got one, and anyone able to get multiples is going to get to sell them at premium prices (which should be the case for rare items).
---
The reasoning behind your post that defends the rare drop rates reflects your maturity. Why can’t we have a fun event and actual feasible rare mask drops at the same time? 
---
What makes them an idiot for using in-game items?
---
I dig it. Trying to sneak in a little gaming before i head to work 
---
Cdkeys . Com
---
Or just give us a camp preset that can only be accessed when in camp
---
I got marsupial as a fluke in my 40s and it really changes the game in such a positive way. My sympathies and I hope you were able to reacquire it.
---
Yeah I changed my mind on it though I still think it's a bit much tell me look at the recipe for the donut does it look does it look like something you would bother to make?
---
Not that I'm aware of, but I think it has some set world spawns that are farmed, and was probably prone to duping before.
---
*BUT MY ENTITLEMENT*
---
I'd say let us "repack" cards. Once you've got 4 cards you don't want, you can use a crafting recipe (maybe requires something like Flux to keep it end-game), to convert them into a fresh pack of random perk cards.
---
Right, and our group has blocked them, I’m just curious about how they avoided wanted status. 
---
well said bro
---
I haven't looked at f76-specific numbers, but it seems similar enough to f4/3/skyrim, the concept is pretty much the same. It is however scaled down and capped at lvl 50, which is better and alleviates the issue, but at the same time it introduces things like levelled equipment. 
---
I was sure I knew it all then yesterday I learned completely new tactic. Never dismiss the possibility of there being a new trick.
---
&gt; I agree that this isn't necessarily what the event is about, but the reason that most people are doing it more than a few times is because they are after the prizes.
---
The word I find interesting in that sentence is the world most. I would say it seems like most people are interested in doing the event is because when they don't get what they want, they are the most vocal.
---
Considering the response to this thread, I would say there's a good chance that MOST people are doing it for fun, and only speaking up on this thread, because it's a positive one that makes them feel they can express themselves openly. 
---
Or the person that must be putting their mic inside their mouth so that all can hear every labored breath.
---
Or the person that must make as much chewing noises as possible for the longest time possible.
---
Some mutations and equipment may put you into PvP inadvertently. See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amsncf/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_power/) and search for "reactive" for example.
---
Or, which I've been afraid of since the announcement of the Survival mode, the rule changes somehow started bleeding into the standard (Adventure) mode so the game/server thinks you are in unrestricted PvP due to some glitch/bug condition.
---
yeah, and half of us didn't want the servers separated, they didn't need to, all they had to do was rework pacifist.  but they did add some things other than PvP that make the Survival server appealing and I like that.
---
This is the mentality everywhere, it's sad how this reaction has seeped into every area, politics, games, movies, music. It's extremes or nothing. While I'm  it happy at shitty drop rates I'm  it furious per say, but this has also been  a build up for years for plenty of players dealing with the same rare drops game after game only to have this game with a bad track record already just do the same thing. Annoying but my life isn't really affected
---
I have recently evolved my thoughts on the chance for rare masks. I am now wondering if the bots have to have 100% health to get a chance at the rare masks.
---
Yeah I'm trying to figure it out because I noticed no difference in the damage output even going through  an addiction... so I didnt know if it grows the the withdrawal effect or even how to check the level of said withdrawal 
---
I haven't participated yet in the events but the world has many more players now, that's always good!
---
\&gt; masks are so rare that I don't even seem others wearing them at the event 
---
  It is also possible wearing a rare mask at the even would open you to being one shotted by one of the angy people you point out who wants, but hasn't gotten.
---
  So if I got one, it would be get out of dodge, avoiding the trading frenzy, etc
---
I like this phrase, I am going to start using this if you don't mind. It is a very accurate description for a lot of posts and videos about FO76.
---
I think it’s related to their duped item removal action. They either truncated the objects’ ID or made the system unable to recognize the entire ID. Thus the wheel can’t correctly differentiate the same weapon with different legendary effects. 
---
It’s actually not just the wheel. Every time I pull something from my stash, it would display a random wrong item of the same type that I also own. I have three different kinds of Gatling, when I pull a Two-shot version from the stash, the system will display the Bloodied version on the screen. It’s very annoying because when I need to sell something to the vendor, it keeps me wondering whether I’m pulling the wrong item. 
---
Yes Bethesda please please fix this, it’s should be way higher on the priority list than funny masks. 
---
We've all forgotten the real meaning of **Fasnacht.**
---
I’ve thrown no tantrums. It is clear that these are not dropping for most players 99% of them that post. These are not legendary items, they are limited time event rewards that will not drop after  Monday ends. We have no clue on what is going on because of Bethesda’s silence. Defending these drop rates by comparing them to legendaries is a mistake.
---
I've done the event 30+ times at this point. I've lost count.
---
I enjoyed it at first. It was a lot of fun and was nice to get the rewards. However, once you get all the common stuff and are doing it over and over again in an attempt to get the rarer items... I've lost interest in doing it any more.
---
If there was more of a chance to get the rare masks, I'd keep at it. However, when there's such a low possibility that I may not even get one doing it multiple times every day, what's the point?
---
Awesome I'll give this a shot 
---
If the drop rate is as we've seen and it's really that low, I don't want them anymore.  I'll probably finish up the recipes and ignore the event until it passes.  
---
None of the people posting about the drop rates are an "average" player in my opinion.
---
everyone: starts shooting the duper hung up on the effigy and throwing molitovs at him
---
me:guys all you have to do is press e to light it
---
The worst thing about dealing with entitlement, is how it's so grounded in belief over fact. Belief is something you feel, it's like some uber emotion. 
---
I believe this, so it's true and how the world works. And disagreeing with my belief is basically telling me that my core being is wrong.
---
it's really terrible. 
---
Have you thought about building a player microwave using radiation emitters?
---
I'm gonna give survival a go, fuck it. I think it's going to suck because of the magical weapons and armor but I've been wrong before. Maybe it'll be fun. I'd really like to see something to make Power Armor viable. It breaks my heart what they've done to it. 
---
It is really funny to me that people can still be saying "the devs know what they are doing" after the first 4 months of this game tho. They fuckin' Y2K'd themselves in 2019 FFS. 
---
Isn't the PvP community just a bunch of people who think they have it all figured out and make their UNSTOPPABLE BUILD^TM and then get absolutely wrecked because there's something they didn't plan for? Tell you what. I'll slip into your DMs. I'll tell you about this build and then you tell me yours. I'm interested in yours, but I'm skeptical since dodgy's easy af to defeat.
---
&gt;  and anyone able to get multiples is going to get to sell them at premium prices (which should be the case for rare items).
---
Which is what I suspect is fueling a lot of the anger. They want it for it's monetary value. In game or real currency. 
---
Hey Mr "Raider" guy, calm down lol.  Are you at work too? I am, otherwise I'd be server hopping at Wes tech to get more legendary gear for survival.  Also I'm sticking up on chems, got about 40 of everything so far lol.  (Especially since they might drop on death now, so I'm putting many in stash).  
---
Anyway it won't be so bad.  We are getting a legend vedor soon too, so even new players will be able to find the "op" gear shortly.   Unlike battle Royale game such as fortnite, the boundary will not constantly be shrinking, forcing us to engage each other.  We can literally go invisible with stealth boy modification to power armor, stealth boy consumables, or chameleon legendary effect found in 1* gear.  If someone wants to avoid the assassins sentinal guy, they can.  (And shoot him from snesk when he walks because he gets no damage reduction from sentinel when he does).  It's not going to play out like deathmatch or some bloodbath, trust me. But if not trust me then at less try it first lol.   
---
I've been a tad on the wary side after someone destroyed the entire camp I made outside Helvetia so that people could use my stuff, but other than that run-in I have met SO many nice and giving people it makes me emotional!! LOL. Every time someone gives me stuff or helps me in some way I fill up with so much gratitude I can't even handle it haha! I'm only level 16 now, but hopefully in the future I can do the same for others.
---
I'm on the verge of that as well. The event is great. I'll keep playing it, I just wish there was MORE evidence of rare masks dropping so that it can stay exciting. 
---
Not today. 
---
I used to lock everything but now I don't think I will. I don't think there's really a point since if someone wants to wreck your place they'll do it whether the door is locked or NOT... anyone else who wants in probably just needs a stash box or workbench lol...
---
This sub has been a battleground since it was started. Compared to the actual disinformation campaigns and false flagging game "journalists" we had for months it's in a much better place 
---
I agree, but also disagree,  if they say they are attainable, and we are 4 days into the event, without a single verified legitimate reward of one of the "rare" ones,  somethings broken.  
---
When they’re nuked? Or normally 
---
You can have both. I've been enjoying the events. Seeing all the players marching along. But it would make it a lot more rewarding to have a better chance at something rare. More incentive to keep grinding out the event. 
---
I like the event too, but not enough to play it 100+ times to maybe get a mask.  I understand rarity, but this is absurd.
---
Ah, the ol' party pooper theory. Now that I think about it, this is obviously the most likely scenario. Ha! 
---
If you were able to get it then it wouldnt be so rare therefore you wouldnt want to wear it. HAHAHA
---
What platform are you on

---
Here's the thing I see. I'm able to do all the content just as well as anyone else, without the rare drops. Certainly the rare cosmetic clothing does nothing to help be in the game. Not having uber weapons and armor doesn't stop me from progressing and beating the game. 
---
Honestly, when a game gets to the point that the gear I have makes everything to easy, I get bored with a game. I play games for the fun, experience and challenge. 
---
PS4, one nuked parade so far.  
---
Nuking the parade even too early can make it impossbile to complete, in that the critters needed for one of the prerequisites wont respawn.
---
I've seen an unexploded nuke in charlestown.  Wonder if someone tried to defuse it and picked the wrong wire?
---
Correct, but you have 1000 rolls of the dice vs 1 roll of the dice.
---
Much greater odds on the whole.
---
What? Pheonix resets regularly. At least Ime he does. 
---
Sorry but while being interested in learning anything to learn I will not send out the details until greenlighted by the owner.

Regarding my current build, I dont use dodgy, I need all the AP I can get elsewhere.
---
Someone did the first day and reported, nothing changed expect the small animals like squirrels didn't spawn. So they had to leave the event to collect the intestines. 
---
dude people are complaining after running the event 5-10 times. Even running it 50 times means a 2% drop rate for a single mask. I wasn't expecting to run less than 100 before I get a first rare drop. I knew there'd be no way the drop rate would be above 1%. Then when this get presented people complain about having jobs/school/families and can't run it that often. Yes that sucks overall, but its analogous to any type of limited release product (pip boy FO4/PA FO76 comes to mind) in the real world.
---
&gt;You don't have any real information about the rate at which the rare masks can drop. 
---
There are multiple posts and comments about numbers of trials and outcomes. You may choose to discount those reports, but I don't see good reason to ignore that information since it's very easy for players to count their non-rare masks to get a denominator of observations. There's little to no recall bias.   
---
We also have Bethesda's own statements, so we **have real information** that rare masks are rare. 
---
I'm not sure what you are on about, but my concerns have nothing to do with my own survivability. I have no interest in playing on a server where the ONLY thing people do is skulk around hoping to come across an unexpecting player to gank.
---
If you read this thread someone say they saw one, in game. So that would mean verified to me. Also, if I got a rare mask. At this point, I'd be Charlie Bucket and not tell anyone and run home. 
---
Because most players would rather have a goofy mask.  LOL, what a game.
---
Interesting. I know whatever they were using was enough to kill me with “slap damage” at points. Or what should have been slap damage.
---
I'd also just fight against it if you're on PC. Sounds like an interesting encounter
---
Technically it is, due to ebay, but that's not really Bethesda's fault and happens in many games.
---
I am stealing this.
---
Thank you.  It feels good to see there are people how there who don't feel like they are "entitled" to have every single thing in an online game available to them.  Single games, sure.   Online games?  They need more of the rare items especially from timed events!  They are 1 week long and I am positive all casuals (like me) can squeak in enough time to get some goodies, but maybe not 100% of them.
---
Nothing in the game files indicates that it's more rare than the items. It drops from a list of 16 items including the beret, 2 recipes, and 12 other plans so you have roughly a 6% chance of getting it provided all robots survive. Happy hunting! 
---
I don't think we have anything that says foxes CAN'T be tamed yet though!
---
They weren’t doing the run in front of shots trick. They were attacking from range.
---
Yep it's really annoying having to add my second handmade every time I log in to the game.
---
Sausages made from spoiled meat and sugar donuts. And drinking. And oumpah pah pah.
---
Maybe some hanky panky behind the Honey Haus. 
---
Could you please delete your last paragraph? ;)
---
My fiancé found a black cat right out of the vault and I wish either of us could have tamed it ;0;
---
Me and a couple friends built a really nice camp just outside of town with a bed trap, electric chair, and a cosy bar. I was just hanging out on a bench watching as the event was supposed to start, we server hopped to see if it triggered but surprise can’t be placed haha 
---
Ok I'll be on after 7 PM 
---
lol good luck bud. everyone and their mom is running this event into the ground in hopes of one. they are obscenely rare. the few people that have posted them have been bombarded with insane offers, allegedly up to $50 even.
---
The responses to your entire post are the people who are either defending the stupid rare drop rates that either drop at so small of a rate that’s comparable to zero or the ones that actually believe that if you do the event enough you will get a rare mask. Why can we not have BOTH? ( 1-5% mask drop rates and a fun community event) why!!? I want to know
---
It's survival, not deathmatch.  
---
Yea, i'd be willing to bet that a decent portion of the complainers had these grand plans to grind all week getting 30+ copies of all masks and plans and had visions of millions of caps, and now they're realizing its not gonna happen and somehow are interpreting it as losing out on all those caps
---
It's such a cute event! From the conductor at the front, to the marching band music you're marching to, to the robots someone programmed, with little masks on. I love it so much. I have mostly been doing it to collect the plans, home decor items are always a win for me. If I don't get them all, I'm not sweating it; maybe I'll get them next year. :) 
---
I had an issue twice. After the very first run through I got dropped right after the event ended and it took a few minutes to get back into a server because it kept timing out. And then the second time I ran the whole event but it was really jumpy. But I left the server after the event and the next place was fine. 
---
no u
---
damn... i need those 308 and 45 counts haha
---
We have a ton of anecdotal evidence.  I personally see it as verifying my experience of running the event around 50 times and that most people have a similar experience.  These masks are so rare that you are likely to never even see one in the game.  
---
People seem to agree that this is more rare than it should be and I personally agree. People shouldn't be getting upset about it if they are, but it is what it is.
---
there are two pics of a sighting of the Goblin mask. [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3ghvv/dataminer_here_list_of_all_fasnacht_rewards_and/)
---
When they're nuked
---
Yup, that's why I make it a point to fire back on the dumb and / or selfish suggestions people make.  Some people act like they speak for the entire player base.  When the game attracts a diverse crowd.
---
Such a great idea! Is the golf outfit the official outfit for the Brahmin Toss or is the golf skirt acceptable as well? 
---
Oh wow! I have a draft about perk cards presets that I was just about to post! I’ll post it anyway because I put time into writing something for once haha. Good to know others have the same idea. More possibility that it will be implemented!
---
last time i checked that thread the ones that were acquired were done through the dev room... but to be honest i haven't checked back in a bit.
---
either way, there is rare... and then there is what it seems to be at currently, where there have probably been millions of quest completions, and so few of them.  with the games history, would not surprise me if there is a decimal in the wrong place somewhere 
---
For a post telling other people to "not be a dick" about it, your comments sure do make you seem like one.
---
I hope you got lots of upvotes to assuage your self-esteem. But please, kindly take your misplaced condescension and shove it.
---
There is some wackiness going on with the current build. I have been rocking my x01 with the owl mask for the parade, but yesterday, I went into the PA chassis transfer menu and equipped my x01 helmet, exited the menu, then got into my power armor. I immediately notice that I’m still wearing my owl mask, and the helmet is nowhere to be found in my inventory. Pretty sure it’s just gone now.

I tried it and the server crashed. What happens if the event completes?
---
Look up all the flux plants, most don't make sense, blackberry turns into yellowcake
---
PC, I'm respecced elsewhere but my friend is currently sporting that particular build. I am also always open for some PvP testing and sparings so feel free to add me and I'll try to summon the guy to show you his defensive capabilities if you'll be both online. ign is imprezobus 
---
It’s called the Hunter’s Longcoat in 76, it can only be acquired from responder traveling vendorbot, and even then I’ve never seen it in his inventory. You can try to spawn said not by server hopping at Charleston Train Station and running across the bridge and back
---
Upvote for the chuckle. Lol. 
---
that I dont know, unless ... You may have to hit them back before the wanted flag appears. 
---
Standard steathboy would do as you described - if you played other FOs you know about those - 
---
and there are some armors that provide stealth.
---
Great info ty. I hope junkies gets a buff ,as per your research , but I still intend on trying this
---
Good lord are you condescending. I was getting a bit of off your original post, but not you're just confirming it. I wasn't denying self esteem and video games can be linked, but this specific situation hardly intertwines those two things. People want to have fun. Wth some people, fun and goals are interlinked (like me). Keep rewarding me, and I'll keep having fun. You don't have to reward me at every corner as that'll have the opposite effect. The problem with these drop rates is that for a none-too-insignificant number of people, getting the exact same reward time and time again is... disappointing. Is it a "going to ruin my day" kind of disappointing? Not remotely. No event that lasts for such a short amount of time should have rewards with this low of a drop chance. These masks more than likely have the same droprate as items that you could grind for month and still not get, like special outfits that are basically legendary as the amount of effort and time required is just insane, and they're only obtainable via events that spawn in the zones like the Forest, Toxic Valley, Cranberry Bog, etc. One of those items is a Whitesprings jumpsuit that can only be obtain in the Savage Divide via playing events. People don't care that they're rare, but the fact that they're this rare within such a tiny time frame.
---
Again AND again, if you watch that twitch stream with the devs and community managers these masks were actually intended to drop. I do not have any explanations to those with the rare masks but I know that these masks needs a higher drop rate to 1-5%
---
So you lost 250 caps because you captured a workshop and got merced?  LOL
---
Platform? Game last updated 10 days ago, so if you're just now seeing this behavior it's more likely a change in your machine (drivers, etc) than in the game.
---
Or make it actually include sugar instead of salt... which we can actually craft.
---
Sorry, wasn't implying you specifically threw a tantrum. That comment was in reference to the posts complaining about, well, everything, but specifically this topic. And you are right. It's over Monday, and we know everything we need. The event is Fasnacht, occurs regularly. The event is time limited. There are rare masks, and common masks, and recipes and plans. And a recurring legendary. It is fun for many.  What else do you NEED to know?
---
&gt;  it’s verdant season at BethesdaGameStudios my friends.
---
Nice metaphor
---
In NV the Female guards had on these sick outfits with fishnets and I would really like to see something like that - my inner Catwoman needs to purr while sneaking!
---
I lost two radtoads and a death claw when I let them go home alone. By the time I found my megasloth I said fuck it got my friend to help my walk it from the mire to twin lakes 
---
You’re dragging on now. You just posted an opinion of what you think the event should be after reading a bunch of drop rate post. These are just as annoying. Bitching about people bitching. 
---
This here is reddit where your opinion means jack shit unless the collective agrees and your post hits 5k. 
---
Do like you say, stop worrying about what people think and go outside. 
---
Let me guess, you took that spot cause no one else was covering it  that's because they were waiting for the sloth  I did the same thing
---
Is this jeopardy? Did i need to phrase things just so? Tse was the go to for dupers, whether handmade, gatling gun, or shotguns, the affix two shot explosive is whay became notorious. 
---
Yea... It's ridiculous too because it's only lv 30... It's not like anybody over lv 40 will get anything useful from it...
---
A low level 3 intelligence gets you in 
---
Yes you need to get really lucky with your spawns tho
---
Both outfits are regulation approved!
---
I ran into him while out exploring yesterday! Nice guy, would buy from him again.
---
Nope! 
---
I made a post about this the other day. The problem is there's no reason to do the event past rue point at which you unlock everything. I've done the event just over 65 times (I work from home and have been idle farming the event while I work, keeping tally of how many it took for me to get the 5 normal masks and all of the plans) and at this point I'm sick enough of the event to not even fast travel over for the march part itself when I'm actually playing. 
---
I think the big problem is there's no middle rarity masks. You get into a situation where you have 10 each of the easy drops but nothing to differentiate yourself from the average person who did the event 5 times.
---
Like I said, I idled through most of the events so it doesn't really feel like I wasted my time, but if I had actually grinded the event for 30+ hours I'd be fairly mad too since I could've gotten the same result with a couple hours of running it. Some people powergame, and others like us are more casual. Our playstyle doesn't negate the fact that they'd be frustrated for "wasting" more than a day irl doing one event in a videogame.
---
Well you need to find a random spawn area and hope to God you get a cat to spawn 
---
...That's not how a debate works. Burden of proof is on the person who made the claims.
---
Nope, even if it kills a player it doesn't, though it does give you a server message that your nuke killed a player.
---
Wow, does he spawn everytime? I thought it was just a rare spawn and he doesnt appear everytime, but maybe it's people killing him solo. 
---
if a player is wanted, yes.
---
I'm honestly confused. Hasn't the game always been survival? You need to drink and eat.
---
No, it's definitely deathmatch. Why would you do anything else there when you can just do it in adventure mode and then come back to deathmatch mode?
---
You don't have any way of verifying those posts and observations. For something to be valid, you have to be able to verify the results. How do you verify someone who says they have done the event over 40 times, when the event had only been going for 24 hours and runs every hours. Sure there's server hoping. But that would mean being really lucky, and spending 24 hours playing and getting 2-3 events in an hour with really lucky server hopping. Or maybe the more likely explanation is the person lost track, or is exaggerating.   
---
If the information and data used can't be verified, no one should accept it as fact. 
---
As for what Bethesda has said. I already said that. So to go back to my point about things that you can verify, and what people say. Notice how you used something I said to try and discredit what I said, even though I agree with that being the only real information we have to work with?
---
That sounds like you dealt with an online troll.  It happens, no need to be salty over 250 caps.  Welcome to online video games!
---
If he's not in his shop, listen for gunfire. Once you've found the protectrons, look in the direction they're aiming. Then take them out and do your shopping. 
---
Cool but like I said you need to have it spawn in a random spawn area to be able to tame it
---
May your med kits always contain a stimpack and your nuke zones be lag free!
---
Anything with explosive changes the shots. Tesla rifles dont fire electricity and lazer wepons dont fire lazers. That's why they removed them from the loot table until they come up with a way to change them. I have a TSE tesla and its basily a ballistic rifle 
---
Why aren’t the rare masks dropping. THATS what I need to know. Why is the drop rate so low that 99.99% of players do not have them. 
---
I love all the secret places you can find with it. Bethesda really shines at that stuff. 
---
Not for much longer. :)
---
Seriously, this guy says a video game company should make a decision on their gane, based on his Reddit post? Get fucking real!
---
Only this isn't some debate. So go do your own research. 
---
Because that's just some attempt to be lazy in my view. 
---
May your legendary drops match the stars of your enemies 
---
Upon completion you load in to fallout 3
---
That's what I try to do, have fun, and then worry about rewards.
---
Plus, I don't even want those masks, I want the camp items and recipes. 
---
Cranberry relish + 10% for one hour
---
Another compromise option. You can transfer characters back and forth, but not items.
---
20% exp buff at all times, 3* unique legendary rewards for challenges, etc etc.  Any other questions? Obviously you didn't read any of the articles so feel free to ask me. I don't want to work right now anyway :P
---
Yeah, I just had never seen someone stay completely invisible for so long at once. I figured there were ways, though.
---
I"ve seen a bunch, so I guess it is you.  Do not tag those robots with melee though... they suicide :-P
---
tl;dr Make the rare masks not rare.
---
Sounds like not, the dude probably shot them and kept intentionally walking in front of them to start pvp.  It's called dealing with trolls online.  Happens to all of us.  Some of us just move past it.
---
The problem with the post I linked is that I was doing all my testing w/ a melee weapon which means all the neg str withdrawls affected the dmg, also I need to try and verify if the buffs stop, I’ve read that folks think 5 is the limit for dmg buff even though you can be addicted to everything...also the longevity of addictions seems buggy, I’ve lost all my addictions after 24hrs and also had them last for weeks.
---
Currently I'm trying to get a foxes and other animals i didnt post I using 3 characters and 2 are for testing purposes.
---
"Hey smoothface where are you looking?!"
---
I don’t think it’s a mistake. Even when you force everyone to start fresh, within a month you’ll be at level 80 and new players joined then will cry unfair because their level 1 pipes won’t stand a chance.
---
Bring in old characters into new pvp mode is NOT a problem. The real problem is the level restrictions and fancy legendary effects. In order to play it fair, all those should be stripped on the dedicated PVP servers in PVP situations. Your level 50 .308 will have the same damage as a level 1 weapon of the same caliber when players shoot each other. Your fancy magic armors don’t count in PVP. Simply put, make it like COD and Battlefield in Hardcore mode. In those games nobody every cried unfair because a 9mm bullet is a 9mm bullet whether you’re a freshman or veteran, where in FO your legendary explosive bloodied quad two-shot and your ‘stand still and never die’ fantasy armor will leave new players no chance. This is just silly and won’t attract any real shooter gamers. 
---
I feel like I was in this server, it was annoying. 
---
I use marsupial, and grab over watch. My suppressors combat sniper is perfect for it... one tag on sloth doesn't kill it, and I can VATS fairly quickly across the wolves. My main complaint is that VATS targets friendlies and neutrals. I have to be careful.
---
I consider the event a great way of meeting new players. Once the event is over I offer help to any group who would want me. Been on some fun adventures helping fresh out of the vault characters. 
---
Your welcome 
---
Yea but I just spoke with someone on Facebook who says his explosive Tesla works fine
---
So you didn't have a mature reply, so opted for insults and put downs?
---
So glad I don't have your life. 
---
Looks like its getting worse. 2 weeks ago it was doing the same thing, but if you had 2 armors in your inventory it could dupe one of your armors onto the other one and I lost all the lvl 15 pieces I was going to transfer to my alt.
---
If you've kept enough robots alive, you get masks, maybe a beret, and plans/recipes. Plus the end of the event always features a legendary megasloth. If your event doesn't have a level 200 that one-shots him, everyone that manages to get in a shot gets a legendary.
---
After I did Mayor For A Day, legendaries started spawning for me last night. I learned not to melee them the hard way lol.
---
I've dropped 100% of the star items I get from the sloth as they are not high levels - so even if someone misses the tag, there is usually quite a few bags.
---
BUT - get your microphones working folks!  This is a great opportunity to communicate to other players and trade/ask for assistance/bullshit.  Last night - I was the only one babbling during the whole parade - was somewhat frustrating.  Have done it \~8 times now - all good fun. 
---
It’s not mob mentality
---
A lot of us long time Bethesda fans got a joke of a game and tried passing off plastic bags instead of the canvas ones
---
Game also went on sale for I believe half price 9-10 days after release and was an absolute mess
---
They should absolutely be ashamed and hopefully learn from this, sure it’s 5 months later and the game is in a much better state
---
They did some absolutely skeezy shit and deserve the reactions they created
---
Wow, I was on your side initially in this thread, but clearly you don't understand the way grown-ups interact in a forum setting. Especially since you called the polls someone else took are "without proof," this is a bold card for you to be playing. 
---
It spawns on both sides of the road. Kinda seems random. Higher levels should be taking the trash tbh, tse melts through those guys. Dont think ive gotten a sloth drop in 10 runs because I'm always hanging back.
---
What is it about the level 52 gutsies that makes them so hard?  The first 3 I ran against I thought "gutsie, this will be easy" but nooooo...  It's like an assaultron with a gutsie skin.
---
&gt;Most ideas I read here are actually pretty good
---
Most I read here go against the design of the game. I wish we could go a day without people asking for perk card decks or something. When FO4 came out fans didn't like how everyone could essentially be a master of everything like Skyrim and wished it was more like FO3. Now they went back to more unique from player to player perks and everyone wants all the perks again.
---
Other ideas sound like they were thought about for a whole minute by someone who clearly doesn't think about game design or development. 
---
I doubt that as the scorched enemy variant of many animals are not possible to tame will keep testing tho
---
I saw 2 on XB yesterday
---
I can’t find the info on the perk cards, but isn’t there a perk card that allows chems to last twice as long or reduces negative effects or something... and would they be beneficial to use with this type of build? 
---
Weird flex, but okay
---
I think both Xbox and PS4 limit the amount of linked accounts you can have. But I am not 100% on the amount. 
---
Everything that you have said and defended had already been discredited by me and many others. These drop rates need to be raised or actually implemented.
---
what I know is that I have not yet seen a single person with a rare mask anywhere
---
I tend to think that MOST of the people dismissing the concerns of other players have probably not been grinding for the masks as they don't really care about that.  Different strokes for different folks.  I don't think that too many people are running it 30+ times just because it is fun.
---
Why would it be any different ?
---
You can also find a world spawn for the illusive Royal Jelly which can be used for Royal Jelly Taffy or Black Berry Crisps.
---
I genuinely believe that the haters believe the same thing about mob mentality about the people who still enjoy it. 
---
For me personally, 76 was such a disappointment. And Bethesda themselves - canvas bag disaster, then making everyone personal data available who submitted a support ticket. Building updates based previous broken versions. It’s been a terrible release. 
---
I think people get so animated and aggressive because they really love the Fallout franchise and it’s a disappointment. 
---
This is only my opinion and I’m not saying you’re wrong because it’s so unconstructive to just whine about how bad it is. And plain rude to mock someone else for enjoying it. 
---
But they're allowing us to bring current toons?!?!??!?! ( Fake outrage howl )
---
Oof. Yeah, a buddy was saying it’s got something to do with anti duping mechanisms, and that the missing stuff should appear on relog.. but I haven’t seen it reappear yet. At least the helmet is craftable. Really sucks to lose legendary armor
---
[Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) strikes again.
---
First of all, I'm not mad about it in the slightest, but I do have some issues with your post here.  Mainly that the event isn't really all that special in terms of having fun, it's a few fetch quests and a few mostly very low level enemies.  Not much in terms of any of the organic adventure stories that people have are going to pop up here (outside of a place to chat with strangers if that's what you are into), and that's where most of the games fun lies IMO.  It's just a few fairly mundane if flavorful tasks that they expect you to do 10-20 times.    The rewards ARE the fun part.  
---
So once you do the quest once or twice, there's no real reason to keep doing it... outside of the drops, or the caps.  
---
While I agree it's a very skinner box-ish experiment to grind out events to get rare cosmetics so you can feel special, but yeah, that is the core MMO experience.    
---
Do I think the drop rates are too high?  Mostly.  Not because I'm so horny to get one, I'm actually more into the camp items and those are easy enough to get.  I just think it's poorly thought out.  You show people something cool, technically 5 cool things and basically say to them "you can try to get these, but in all honestly you won't get one." in a timed event, even if it is yearly.  Like you should know from the get go people are going to be salty about it.  That's why in these kind of games I really prefer a consistent reward structure (like special currency so you are always moving toward earning the reward you want) to rng drops.    
---
I think the event would have been much better received if the 5 masks dropping at that insanely low rate dropped more like 5% of the time, and maybe leave one secret one that drops at the absurd rate that no one see unless a player gets it.  That way people will have the feeling of accomplishment for putting in the grind, and there would still be that mythic uber rate lotto ticket mask out there to chase. 
---
Also, the complaint about the poll not being accurate, I disagree, it's probably pretty accurate.  1k sample size is basically enough to get a pretty accurate representation of any number of people (99% confidence level with a 3% margin or error).  Sure the info gathering method was haphazard, and were looking at drop rates not opinions, but I'm pretty confident that the number the poll showed is not far off from the actual number.    
---
I could but it would pretty much just be the player oven again
---
yeah but if there are like two skull masks in existence and he gets the third one that suckers still rare af
---
There were 6 robots at the start of the parade, do more join?
---
Hes just fighting the good fight, keeping Watoga secure.
---
Oh I meant to say that if you move your camp piece around inside of the camp area the pet will follow it around to a certain extent, you just have to move it and then wait a couple minutes before moving it again :) 
---
And I totally agree you can run them home, but you’ll have to deal with everything that spawns :) as long as the area around is clear I think they should make it back mostly because they themselves won’t spawn enemies. I’ve also seen a lot of animals get stuck walking, seems to affect bigger stuff more often. It’s sure not easy to get anything with any method tho haha
---
This. Judging by posts in recent months:
---
We'd all have TSE miniguns that 1 shot all creatures.
---
Scorched beasts would be nerfed to never fly, hardly use their attack and die quickly.
---
We'd be reporting other users for griefing, for instant bans. Even though people playing this have no idea what griefing actually is.
---
There's by no rare items because we'd all have everything.
---
Disease would go because it's an inconvience. Food wouldn't go bad.
---
This game would be too damn eazy and die in a week if they made all the changes people want from here.
---
Although I would still want more stash space and camp build limit if I ruled the world.
---
Well for one turrets may be auto hostile. 
---
Yesterday had the sloth appear by the church, when everyone was by the truck across the street, so it does happen....
---
This sounds bad. They effectively remove lite pvp elements from Adventure and now if you want to do any PvP you have to go Survival mode for the hardcore pvp.
---
I give no cares about upvotes. Like I already said, I fully expect a lot of downvotes and to be attacked. Well before you tossed in your insult. 
---
Yes, I'm a dick to some people. Just like you're being a dick now. 
---
Absolutely. A 1% drop rate does not mean that  if you run it 100 times you will get 1. It means that you could run it 10,000 times and never hit that 1% chance that you have each and every time. If everyone got a rare item, it would not be...rare. 
---
Thanks didn’t think about respawns I’m at work right now so can’t check but which perks go with stealth?
---
But the rare masks are not dropping. A lot of players want to grind for them.
---
Ahh i have no idea if it was in one of those or not.
---
I guess it's mostly schadenfreude (the joy of seeing something go wrong). Nowadays people love to be negative, to see someone else go through misery and quite often they also love to pile on with their own negative comment. People simply can't watch something go wrong, they need to become invested in the negativity. And when they are invested in something, they won't admit that they can be wrong. Any idea that Fo76 is not that bad is a personal attack on their effort put into meming, trolling and hating the game. They can't allow that. They'd rather hate on you too than change their mind...
---
I don’t know how well this would work since all the factions are dead...
---
Please don't lump everyone into one pot. I've been doing YouTube for 2 years. I have a small channel with only 15k subs. All I've ever done is make hundreds of lets play videos and tutorials to help people who play Fallout 4 and the FROST and Horizon mods for Fallout 4. It's a very small amount of youtubers that do what you are describing. I took journalism classes in high school and wrote for both my high school and college newspapers. The FIRST thing we learned is how importing objective reporting is.
---
Personally imo all your comments come off as somewhat “know it all”.  Kind of like your opinion must be fact. Again this is reddit.. what did you expect?
---
Also way to finish off with an insult of your own. Ya hypocrite.
---
There is a card that effects chem use duration but nothing that mitigates withdrawls...only thing that’s close is the one that outright prevents addiction to alcohol...both r in the endurance tree
---
Th...there’s a sloth?
---
Circle gotta jerk.
---
Im making a map with all known possible random spawn locations 
---
But what about the people who want to farm for them. Why can’t we actually do the fun event and then get a chance for a rare mask? Why can’t we have both? 
---
Agreed 
---
Thanks for your reply. Looks like I’ll have to go hunting for him.
---
This. They should look at how other MMOs handle trading and mimic that system. 
---
yerp, the 76 reddit community is fairly capricious in its temper tantrums!
---
Pretty sure there's only supposed to be 5 at a time.
---
But why? We are the ones that paid for the game, and I believe we should have some direct say on what happens in the game. 
---
Nope. You're escorting those (and the master of ceremonies doesn't count; there are just 5 you need to concern yourself with). You \*do\* get joined by a bunch of radtoads, supermutants, and sometimes scorched and wolves, though.
---
At this point for me I got 3 outfits I swap from. 
---
Enclave Drill Sargent 
---
Forest Ranger turned Raider
---
Vault Cultist
---
So I don't really have a need for that sorta thing. But I can understand your point.
---
&gt; We have a ton of anecdotal evidence.
---
You realize that anecdotal evidence means stories based on experience, rather than facts? For example, the first day of the event people said it ended with either the sloth of the wolves and stingwings. But that was anecdotal, because it can end with just the sloth, just the wolves and stingwings or both.
---
If someone only does the event a few times, and only gets two out of three of the ending outcomes, they will tell you it end one of two ways.
---
But that's wrong, isn't it?
---
Where did this person insult you or put you down?  I believe it is a mature reply.  What I think is not mature is your numerous comments telling people they aren’t living their life correctly as opposed to you. 
---
“I build my life around experiences”. Fuck right off with that nonsense, it makes you sound really preachy.  
---
Don't answer my question with another question lol.  Has there been any info or not? XD
---
After writing a lengthy post trolling people upset with the event's drop rates?
---
I hope getting lots of posts helps your self-esteem, i truly do.
---
The irony is not lost on OP. I think they are aware and that's why they said it like that. Sorry, Yurd, as much as I like your username... I think this is a woosh.
---
I play the way these guys do. Ita legit. Not griefing. Im happy to answer any questions you have. Heres what could have happened:
---
Someone on your team owned a workshop. Pvpers can tag it and fast travel to you.
---
Someone on your team slapped the PvPers back. 
---
Someone on your team has a mutation that slaps players back. 
---
If they slap you to death they get a 50 cap bounty.
---
Stealth boys allow them to be invisible, moving and unVATsable. Take a berry mentats to counter it. 
---
So after Red Skull guided Thanos and Gamora to the Soul Stone on planet Vormir he vanished and ended up in Appalachia?! 
---
Wow. It all makes sense now. 
---
And after Thanos snapped his fingers, every human NPC disappeared. 😱
---
Who is Grahm?
---
Makes sense, but I think I'll pass playing through again. I'll focus on that in FO76 instead, although I'll prob just end up eating shit loads of dogfood and cram instead of crafting recipes haha. I'm a slightly lazy gamer tbh. 
---
Asking the important questions.
---
Thanks!!! :D
---
I’ve never tried it, is that pretty good? What’s its benefits?
---
While Poe's Law is most certainly true, I honestly don't think that's the case. OP made his soapbox to stand on, and seems to think because his post got upvotes, it gives support to his position. 
---
Finally got it last night, after my 15th or so parade. 
---
hah are we still talking about this?  Who cares if people hate it, there's literally nothing to be done, it won't effect your gameplay, so just ignore it.  
---
I think people have the wrong concept about this event and how items work in fallout 76. This isn't a solo collect em all game. Its a semi MMO/survival. The rarer masks are like super rare mounts from wow or that AQ event where one person on the entire server gets one. Throwing hissy fits because you aren't beating the .03 odds is on you. Get over it, you cant have it all in this game. 
---
And if we all got all the rare masks that kinda defeats the purpose of being *rare*
---
I understand completionism and all that, I enjoy having unique items, but I won't be bummed if I don't get everything available. Hell they'll probably do it again next year anyway. I'd rather look forward to the joy of getting something that's surprising.
---
Only options are to run Class Freak to reduce it to -1 strength or cleanse and get your mutation build back with either serums or rads.  
---
There’s a chance using radaways may take it off first or relatively early and you won’t need to spend too much on serums.
---
It seems like this last week since the update I have seen more NPC bots than ever.
---
Insult bot, recruiter bot, gutsy lemonade stand,  and I think there was one more. might have been a free roaming vendor bot.
---
This is my guess too. Dozens of items that refill AP. Consuming them on the way up.
---
Also send this to your friends if they want to know about it and dont forget to upvote it so other can see it to
---
They are dropping. There are photos of them on Reddit. Why do 99.99% of Redditors who take the time to create posts that include photos of in-game items not have them? 
---
I'll not insult you by posting the Googled definition of rare, but I'll point out that Reddit is a microcosm of the FO76 community. 
---
And Pics or it didn't happen!
---
Hang around after the event - most people gather by the fire for group photos.  Get out of your power armor and face the same direction as everyone else too.  I don't want pictures of your ass when everyone is posing, but do want you in my photos!
---
Same
---
I was just saying to my friend the other day, that it would be nice if markers were colored by proximity.  Close up bright, far away dull.  
---
So much whining that they actually made something rare. Just keep grinding. Thats the point. Ive done it close to 50 times. Nothing rare yet, but the more I do it the more of a chance I have to get one.
---
Dang
---
Lol getting down voted for asking a question you though was legitimate and peoples snarky answers getting upvoted. People are so rude on the internet.
---
Than you don’t have to vote. I don’t advocate making it mandatory. But I think we should have the option. 
---
Some game changes can not be rolled back easy once they have been put in the game. I am trying to suggest a way that they could prevent choices that would cause backlash. 
---
You have a better chance of finding the golden ticket and winning the chocolate factory from Willy Wonka. But don’t let me discourage you
---
It seems simple, just enact the level based killing rules that most PVP things have.  You can only attack people +/- 10 (15, whatever) levels or so of you. Maybe until 100 then anyone that level and higher can gank each other.
---
You will never have smokables. I'm willing to stake... well... I dunno… one stimpak on it to the first person who says "HAH, they put smokables in game"
---
They just won't.
---
half of your  post explains that bethesda delivered something for the people you later blame that they are playing the game.
---
your post does not make any sense whatsoever.
---
if you truly believe that player that grind for exclusive stuff are to blame then why you praise that bethesda implemented something rare?
---
doesn't make sense ...
---
After studying only the comments of a single negative bitch thread on this sub (not even going as far as looking through comment histories which would have been even more glaring) I counted dozens of people complaining about the game in a single thread that literally don't even play it anymore. A couple of hardy souls joining the circle jerk had literally never played it before.
---
I wouldn't take it too seriously. 
---
All players will be automatically tagged as hostile in Survival Mode.  So, in theory, CAMPs will become fortresses.  Should completely change the building design and need to address any weak points in defense.  I’m sure aesthetics will be tossed out the window in favor of concrete walls, fortified power generators, and as many turrets as possible. 
---
As in they killed the Insult Bot?
---
&gt;r/Fallout: Don't ever go there. It's a cesspool of hate towards anything which is a) not turn-based combat in 2d or b) not from Obsidian
---
Actually, since Fo76 released their stance on Fo4 has eased quite a lot. Usually when I visit r/Fallout the narrative is that Fo4 is not that bad and only Fo76 sucks. Which is funny because right before Fo76 release Fo4 was a child of satan to them. While I admit they are still capable of hating on Bethesda as a whole, they seem to be incapable of hating on more than one Fallout game... It reminds me of WoW players. WoW players can also hate on only one expansion and usually it's the current one...
---
I bought it last night from the Watoga train vendor.  It seems to randomly show up.
---
It's Secret Agent in INT. 3* give stealth boys 4x duration.
---
This is a conversation. Not a debate. I'm not debating you. I'm also not interested in handing anyone links and information, that I know from experience has a very low chance of them reading. As low as rare mask from Fasnacht. 
---
Something did, yeah. Not me, I like the guy.
---
Maybe, yeah. That's an interesting idea.
---
That's not what those words mean
---
Well, that's all the proof we all need. I guess the guy in this thread that said he saw one was lying. 
---
I could be wrong, I'll admit it. It's been a weird 24 hours for me in this game. A BoS group kicked me out right after I joined because they didn't like my name. When I said "yep, just call me turd" the guy was like "I most certainly will not".
---
People are just taking this game way too seriously, I don't get it.  
---
Workshop ganking is almost always the real culprit here.
---
Bethestards will literally defend anything smh
---
If  Bethesda would massacre a school this sub would be the first to say they did nothing wrong lmao
---
need a new thread for this - won't steal you Karma....
---
Kinda like how the data miner was asking for other's experiences? Mhm. Hey Pot, meet my friend Kettle over here.
---
They stack up to two but will still only look like one in your inventory. If you turn in two you get 400 XP instead of 350 and the rewards are supposed to be better but I don't know what the specific differences are.
---
That's all I wanted too, because I find those more useful all the time. 
---
Did you ever play Everquest? The first one. Some quests you only had one time in a year to get the item you needed to complete it. And there was always a que for those items. 
---
i switch to my  non explosive sniper and vats target it a couple times then back away so others can too.  Only think i drop quick during the parade is the suiciders
---
I usually drop everything i get. Sausage plan is the only thing i still need.
---
After the event, i want to run around leaving gift bags with 1 donut, 1 sausage, and 1 beer.
---
Or the opposite.
---
I curse all your fist aid kits to have dirty water~!
---
To be fair, I ALSO want assn/sentinel godmode builds nerfed. But until then, I guess I'll just carry a gamma gun.
---
And if they are dropping (as I have said in many many replies) it is so close to zero that the event is not worth doing. The masks are so rare that they are not dropping and those few rare mask people got them from the dev room or they have a drop rate close to 0. It’s like in borderlands 2 where farming terramorphous for the grounded hide of terra has a 1 in 1,000,000 chance
---
Yup same, that's exactly what I wanted.  
---
&gt;They took a really beloved series and made an asset flip cash grab that cost 60 bucks, had barely any content, crashed constantly, and is rife with 'microtransactions' where things like gun skins cost 20 dollars (including attempts at doing pay to win microtransactions where you can buy more HP temporarily). 
---
This paragraph means you are either a troll or seriously misinformed.
---
His ai is tethered to that spot so he really can't leave watoga so if he's gone you could just wait for him or listen for robots shooting
---
Making everything a grind is just mmo 101.  Since you have to keep adding in new content to keep people interested you have to make every bit you add stretch as far as possible so you have time to make the next one.
---
Ah hes alright most the time, i know he panders to the "everythng bethesda does is wrong" crowd a lot but he does show both sides of a story 95% of the time, even if its just a little late with another video
---
I've run the event 25 or so times, because I'd like to get as much of the camp plans. So I am grinding it for something. When the event is over, I'll more than likely start hiding my extra masks around the world, for people to find. For people that might have missed out or started the game after the event. 
---
Following as I need serums but also need to farm the mats.
---
Why is it that every time the devs screw up dozens of people make shill posts telling the player base to just be grateful for what we have? 
---
I've got a couple max lvl berserk rifles-what sort of perks were you looking for-I'm pretty sure one is 2* and the other 3*
---
I thought I was going to be added for the parade with the way they said to trade masks. 
---
But when I first went to do it I ended up locked in a game of attrition with another player, were we both requested masks, but neither of us wanted to put up caps in fear of being ripped off lol. 
---
&gt; [Faschnacht Topic] Bethesda, when you said the masks were "exceedingly rare" we didn't know it would literally be exceedingly rare.
---
We didn't?
---
Watching Mad Max 2 will be a far better education on the matter, or playing any other fallout game and observing raider behavior.
---
And I absolutely mean that if you ignore things like the workshop popup and freak out because you got ganked while questing that you are absolutely at fault. Also pacifist mode is not a "no pvp ever" option. It never has been. This is not a pure PVE game and never was designed to be.
---
Those robots attack him because they want all their crappy legendaries back, and he just goes ape on them.  
---
I totally agree. All this "they should have made them start with fresh character!!' don't realize all they'd be doing it putting a delay button on it...
---
Ah righ ok
---
You can make level 1, 5, 10 and all the rest all the way up! Giving one to a newer player is like Christmas morning! 
---
I thought they fixed the mutation/armor passive slapping back in the latest patch? It’s still a thing? 
---
Lock the damn things. Screw this "I can be whatever build I want with a  couple seconds effort" crap.
---
Lock them down. Allow respect at every 30 levels.
---
Oh, my girl needed that coat. She is Jackie O with a chaingun.
---
Hmm, this is something different.  Maybe related to mutations or something that hits back after impact?  I know some mutations hit things that are near you without provocation.
---
Didn't runescape use an in game polling system to help decide on features users wanted added?
---
Any effects really, I'd need to take a look at them.
---
I think he's spawned half the time I've done the even some 25 times. A couple of times he was unlootable. 
---
I got a couple decent items. Nothing I think I would use, but maybe hold onto when the Legendary merchant is put in game. 
---
This has literally been posted since the beta. It's not going to happen. They don't want you speed swapping through perks on the fly. If they did, it would already be in the game. 
---
Man thats really good thanks
---
The rare masks circulating are due to exploiters, those masks aren’t legit. No one has had a confirmed drop from this event yet. 
---
Yea. Its Bethesda's sick little experiment in impulse control. 
---
Simpme fact is PvP is FUCKED in the current game and if characters change over it will be FUCKED there too. I quit...for many reasons, but was thinking of coming back to try survival. I wont be back if its not a clean slate. 
---
Mr. Sloth glitched out on me and gave me nada. Pretty sure I hit it too :(
---
Which vendor in was bunker has the mods on them?
---
Everyone did start from the same spot...
---
I'll make it over in the Filthy Casuals reddit. 
---
If you're on PC:
---
Step 1: Go to [Nukes &amp; Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=) and model out all your loadouts, bookmarking the results
---
Step 2: Install [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) and toss all those bookmarks into perkloadoutmanager.ini, e.g.
---
`SLOT1=`[`https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=NO%20CARDS`](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=NO%20CARDS)
---
`SLOT2=blah, blah, blah`
---
Step 3: PROFIT!
---
If you're not on PC, submit tickets naging Bethesda until they implement Perk Loadout Manager in game.
---
Charleston is a great place for a nuke. White springs just isn't the same anymore. 
---
I hope so. 
---
Any player will be treated as a threat until either they're out of shooting distance or dead as a doornail. 
---
/u/ladydevann  can you confirm 100% that there are masks that only drop if there is less then 5 robots alive.  because that is counter to another bethesda stream clip that's been floating about that says your best bet is to keep them all alive.
---
i've never had a robot die, and i keep getting giant and owl masks, but none of the others.
---
&gt; [Faschnacht Topic] Bethesda, when you said the masks were "exceedingly rare" we didn't know it would literally be below zero
---
If the drop rate is "literally below zero" you mean you started the event with a mask and it took it away from you?
---
I would like to hang my event masks on my cabin wall taxidermy-style. 
---
With the lattice system it changed a lot, cool 3 way fights became more rare, but the faction as a whole could still be fighting 2 fronts from each faction.
---
Planetside 2 learned a lot along the way, and if Fallout 76 tried a factional war system they might also need a lattice system to focus combat in certain area because Appalachia is even bigger and there are no vehicles. Or you just have everyone running around eachother capturing territory in stealth and not fighting.
---
I think though that the persistent equipment in Fallout 76 also poses another challenge for balancing. Players  are a lot less equal in Fallout and that makes PVP tough to balance.
---
You have to tag it quick. Because some of the higher level guys will literally kill it in 2 seconds
---
It was so very blatantly an ironic joke, friend. I think it's time to let this one go, everyone else got it.
---
You do know that most people in the game are not no lifers, so odds are that most people will be encountering mainly other regular people.  People who do nothing but game will always have the advantage, not matter what, in any scenario where time invested is relevant, they make up a fairly small fraction of the whole playerbase.    
---
Starting fresh won't 100% level the playing field, but it would make it far more level than letting everyone just log on with whatever character they have fully leveled and geared.  
---
We can slam Psycho, but can't grow that sticky glowing green?
---
Beth pls
---
With PA, I suggest the following
---
-Stealth boy modification.
---
-Heavy weapon
---
-Perk for stagger chance using heavy weapon (forget name, using phone and at work)
---
Secondly, this will be an open pvp situation so if you sneak around and don't fire until you see them walking you'll do full damage (minus reductions from assassin set).  Because sentinel requires standing and not moving and cavalier requires sprinting not walking and not standing still.  With stealth boy you can be quite sneaky in PA 
---
I'm surprised to see that drinking emotes weren't added
---
How much for it?
---
Haha, yeah i see, i wish my 2 shot minigun killed in 2 shots
---
Everyone keeps lighting up red I'm assuming it's a random bug? 
---
Well, then they shouldn't explode into confetti. 
---
Hit tip: if you're quick enough, you can repair the balloons as they pop. (Melee only)
---
I have wondered if the health of the bots plays a role in the chance for rare masks. No damage at all to the bots = increased chance of rare masks.
---
I bet when they add in the ability to make stuff in your stash boxes displayable in your camp, you will be able to do this. I want to do this. 
---
Same. And if I use someone else’s camp I try to leave a decent present behind. 
---
The issue for me is that there's really not much incentive to play on the server unless you are specifically hunting other players. We can farm in safety on adventure mode, store the majority of our aid items, our junk, xfer off our caps to a friend or mule account, fast travel to where we want to go in adventure mode, then load up on survival (unless they made it so you start at Vault 76 no matter what when you switch from adventure to survival?). It removes the risk. Anyone with half a brain will play mostly in adventure and just go player hunting in survival. That's not the pvp experience that I want. I want real danger, real fear, real risk and reward.
---
The fresh start thing is cool, because I get really sick of seeing everyone with full assn/sent gear that they bought off of ebay or got from a duper 99% of the time. Dupes probably aren't 100% fixed though, so you're right it's a temporary fix.
---
Another thing - bounties in survival are pointless. You're literally just giving the guy who killed you free caps, when they have their friend kill them for the bounty. Hell you could tell a random stranger to kill you and split the bounty. The people with 'godmode' builds will probably kill a friend just to have the friend give them a bounty, so they can have more pvp.
---
There are just too many ways to exploit switching between the game modes right now, and too many ways to remove risk. This is why they should be separated.
---
Drop 1 bullet if u can't see it nearby and the lot will all re appear in new bag
---
I don't want it nerfed because there's no point to that. I'd prefer different game design with no legendary items but thats not relevant to F76. I do suggest having a gamma gun at all times.
---
Only 4 were on a team. The rest of us were just there and not aggro’d, didn’t own a workshop, nothing. Even if I can’t say that with certainty for anybody else that was there, I know that I didn’t own a workshop. I also died twice before I fired a shot. I understand that once you return fire all bets are off and I’m fine with that. I got my licks in with a mini nuke. 
---
And I’m honestly not even upset about it. It comes with online gaming. To me the “griefing” aspect of it comes from attacking people repeatedly that aren’t wanted, aren’t PVP, don’t own a workshop. 
---
Just genuinely curious about how you attack a peaceful player with no workshop connection without becoming wanted.
---
Do you have proof they aren't legit. because I remember reading those items were removed from the game. 
---
I’ll believe it when I see spring, for now we are still stuck in a long cold winter. 
---
Pretty sure they've stated numerous times that they want feedback and will develop the game according to the feedback they receive.  Are you suggesting players say nothing, because you seem to be upset.
---
All of your proposed reactions are totally right in line with the reward they are looking for with the exception of blocking and changing servers, which is really the only effective response to griefing that we have at our disposal.
---
You have never been properly griefed if you don't think that someone would do something like that for hours.
---
It’s awesome, isn’t it :)
---
I said maybe like 50times but them advertising the rare masks in the picture and nobody believes that they are in there isn't cool. I have been having fun while doing it Ive invited lots of new people to my xbox party and talked with them. 
---
That makes sense as to why I got 2 quests one day relatively close to each other. 
---
I am well aware of the irony of my post. 
---
It'd be nice to have stash sorted by function, but having player stash vs world stash opens it up to abuse and deliberately going beyond the stash limits. 
---
Eh. I played The Division when it came out and the Dark Zone was a free for all where if you encountered more than one person, the odds were extremely high that they were going to try to gank you or steal your extraction bag as you attempted to get it out. 
---
You shouldn't be playing a game where parties can form against you solo in any game, straight up. It's not worth the heartache and endless bitching from people that can't hack it. You can stay in your lane in safety but don't put on your big boy pants and then complain when you get the big boy treatment. 
---
You literally smoke drugs out of a broken lightbulb in the last numbered Saints Row game. 
---
Just make 7000 lol
---
That depends on the mod, the mod to stop you from selling your gun or armor you use during lag spikes is literally only 3 lines long. Yet Bethesda still hasn't implemented that fix, even though its been around since the beta.
---
Its just a fully modded hunting rifle (I think).
---
omg only 1 more to go!
---
Why is when someone doesn't get what they feel they are owed and deserved, they assume it's because someone made a mistake. Oh yes, because Bethesda has made mistakes before.
---
Just like literally every single person every born or will be born in this world, and probably every where in the universe. 
---
I mean, really what kind of reasoning is that. Someone made a mistake so I will use that as a reason every time I am displeased at my own life. 
---
Sheesh. 
---
every part of that is true. This game uses majority reused assets, costs 60 dollars, had legendary poor stability,  has basic skins at 16+ dollars and has a cash shop that has at times sold temporary HP increasing items along with the cosmetics. 
---
Oh that would explain why I always thought I had more than one to turn in, but my inventory only showed one. 
---
I don't want to I really like the game but they just made my $80 that I was fine with spending feel like crap. Sorry
---
Pretty much! I just thought it was cool as ive never seen people with them. Giving this to a low level would be the best thing that ever happened to them lol. 
---
That is exploitable too though unless there is dome kind of a flag timer attached, like you are flagged hostile for 5 minutes if you set foot in the place. But I agree, you wander in and you are flagged for pvp.
---
I got it on my second time 
---
you can get in the enclave vendor in whitesprings bunker, but you need to complete the enclave quets first
---
Wow, you don't know seem to know the difference between a debate or a conversation. And you don't seem to know how to have a conversation, because you just jump around. You are why block was invented. I'm sure theres lots thinking the same about me. I encourage being blocked. 
---
Finally we'll TAKE BACK CONTROL from the Scorched and without the EU, we'll be able to invest an additional 350 million pounds into the NHS! Per week! We'll make AVR Medical Center great again!
---
VATS
---
Duper's crutch is pretty much anything TSE. I'd love a TS The Dragon but I don't want to in any way resemble the kids that don't play the game with anything except one shot capable weaponry. 
---
Sounds good! 
---
It's better than it had been. I think Wild Appalachia renewed people's hopes that the game would become something good, and they've allowed their imaginations to roam free on other enhancements they'd like to see. Fun stories and cool pictures are much more commonly found in r/fo76FilthyCasuals, though.
---
5 plus the parade master, so 6 total.  The 5 can be killed, those are the ones that you need to protect.
---
Unless the suiciders get through or everyone ignores the wolves at the end in favor of the sloth, it should be pretty easy to complete with all the bots alive.
---
The game started off pretty shaky. Not to mention over the years of Fallout games we have seen Bethesda gradually build the series up into a more enjoyable game. We started getting content that made the Fallout universe more playable and believable. 
---
Once Fallout 76 came out, many players realized it went a step backwards on many levels and did not appreciate it. I will be back one day for more Fallout 76 but as of now I am having much more fun playing Fallout 4 survival mode with some graphics and texture overhauls. 
---
Any item you sell will show up in the vendors.  But you have to close the vendor window and reopen it for the new items to appear.  And any player can see the items you sell to a vendor.
---
Aw man, unfortunately not on PC but it might be time to get one for reasons like these!
---
Like I said, I've been wrong before. 
---
I just... look, putting polling booths into the game... there's just *no way* they'd ever be used to get player feedback for updates. There's so many posts every week with extremely outlandish ideas here, and anytime you post in the negative about one of them the OP gets all up in arms and people defend it, downvote you into oblivion because they agree with it... Bethesda is giving very little validation to posts like this. Why would anyone think their "bright idea" will be implemented, when they've released a roadmap saying what's coming and also have small bugs and whatnot to fix? We don't have the power here, the devs do. 
---
If you don't like the reality of raiders in fallout play another franchise. 
---
You have done a great job of promoting your sub. And you have brought others to downvote me. Who here is the real dick? Methinks you.
---
Wow, is that like the lowest thing a person could say. How nice you can be so casual about people being murdered. You need therapy if you go right to that and an example. 
---
Smoking crater.
---
Scrap ever one you find
---
Let me know what your looking for. I can probably help. 
---
Isn’t the old man effigy the bonfire?
---
This sounds like a fun idea. I hope we can have two different camps for adventure and survival cause rn my camp is based solely on decoration. But it’s also glitched inside a skyscraper so no one can get to it so I guess that could serve as an impenetrable defense
---
Ya the beret is a good example I've gotten like 2 or 3 of those that's the only thing I like getting now. 
---
Which vender. There's multiple in the bunket
---
Yeah, but where it lands may have to be honors system, at least in some situations. 
---
That could work as long as it would cease to work past level 50.
---
Could you share?
---
I hear ya, happened to me several times. When you see the majority of the crowd is lower than level 100, just save your ammo and go back to farming at WS lol. Someone said the queen adds 50k hp per player, imagine yourself doing not just your part but also five brownie knife guys’ share. Technically impossible. 
---
They never did. Slap damage was never a problem. People taking workshops and not realizing they could be ganked on the other side of the world and freaking out when it happens os the real problem.
---
Interesting, I'll test it out more!
---
This matches with my current camp - I always end up exactly on the north edge of the build area!
---
Lmao, that just says so much right there. GG lol
---
The effigy? I got it first try gave it to my friend but they built it at my camp at least
---
I actually think he does spawn every time. I thought there were a few times where he didn’t but a short walk around discovered his dead body outside of town behind buildings. Once I noticed I kept an eye out and found out there are a few people who have been running out ahead and trying to solo it before he enters town. 
---
It’s not like you get a better reward for killing it yourself so it really makes no sense other than those people being dicks.
---
Had a 150+ idiot with a TSE combat shotty, he killed 4/5 robots from splash damage by the time the suiciders showed up,killed the last one shooting at a stingwing. Thanks!
---
Enjoy indestructible rocket turret camps on Whitesprings.
---
Dude, that's fair. Like I said elsewhere, a group wouldn't admit me because I call myself Turd yesterday. 
---
I CAN'T TELL WHAT'S REAL ANYMORE. 
---
I'll post details when I can
---
Oh look someone who gets it!
---
I mean don't get me wrong, if you want the masks and fun, go ahead, I'm just stating what I like to do. Just because I like fun and camp items doesn't mean I don't server hop and farm like the rest of ye. 
---
That isn't how that works. You bought a game with heavily advertised pvp elements, it is on you when you hit the play button.
---
The fact that no redditors have reported earning the masks in any legit manner after 4 days into the event is very strong evidence that the masks aren’t being rewarded from the event, couple that with exploiters bragging about getting the masks by glitching into the dev room. 
---
I don't think the brahmin think this new venture is less nefarious  :P.
---
In Adventure Mode I absolutely agree, because that makes the game easier from an RPG standpoint, and that's rewarding. But what I'm looking forward to in Survival Mode is balanced, squad-based combat. In that context, I wouldn't want/need legendaries to enjoy playing any more than I would in any other team-based shooter.  I think there needs to be new incentives to keep players interested in this new play style, but between perk synergy and team strategy it will be a whole new ball game. 
---
I'd be happy if loot in Survival Mode dropped legendaries that were inert in that game mode, but given the world dynamic the general incentives for squad-based shooters should be more in line with what players in BRs and traditional FPS would appreciate: ranking systems (think prestige ranks rather than leaderboards), and access to exclusive cosmetics.
---
No no,  i agree. On the fly could be potentially game breaking. Lock it to a camp or stash box out of combat only.
---
If he is unlootable I think it has something t to do with larger groups of high level players doing massive damage. If you have bloody mess or a bladed weapon you should be able to attack the body and loot the pieces. 
---
Next time you think he doesn’t show up walk around the back of the candlemakers building see if his body is back there.
---
Agree with the Placement theory especially because I'm B/U Sniper - if V9 isn't clear I won't bother.
---
I'm really not a fan of "rock, paper, scissors" gameplay design. That's why I dislike the "I'm a god UNLESS you have __insert counter here__". It forces meta builds and meta strats on everyone.
---
The more people screaming for it the better!
---
I would argue that since it is something a group can work around that it is also a challenge. I see no difference between the nuke and the robots. Both are obstacles that another player initiate that can be worked around.
---
The MODUS terminal in the armory. Upstairs near the terminal that gives you code card and key card locations
---
The only mask I wanted was the owl, and I got it on my first run. Now my Melee Mothman Cultist build fashion is complete. Owl Mask (Since it looks like mothman due to the eyebrows and big red eyes) and the Cultist outfit found northeast of Vault 76 in a basement of a red building behind a gas station.
---
Green thumb is the best
---
I'm actually really happy with this. I think it allows an outlet for people who want to fight. The adventure mode change WRT slap dmg solves a lot of my issues in that mode.
---
Sure, people who have god-mode builds will do well in survival, but I think we'll adapt. I'm already a bit of sneaky sniper and crouch everywhere I go anyway. I like the tension associated with this. I can totally see someone following me through Harper's Ferry and waiting until I'm overwhelmed and just one hitting me. It might suck in the moment, but that's the level of challenge I want. I want to have to be aware of my surroundings at all times because the world is dangerous.
---
And yes, I think you'll have silly scenarios where people run in circles jumping and shooting each other, but for those of us who just want more of a challenge, this seems to provide it. I think it'll actually force real teamwork too. Meeting someone and opening up your mic and saying, "Hey, this is dangerous. Want to team up?" might actually mean something now.
---
We're so quick to shoot down what Bethesda passes out now, but the last few patches have been positive. So, I dunno, I'm positive here.
---
oh, most definitely. Impossible without it, at least for an old guy like me. As I noted elsewhere, I try to grab Overwatch, ping the sloth on vats, and then VATS my way through the wave. I have to be careful, VATS will target both bots and friendlies. At best its inefficient to shoot allies/escorts, and at worst, I can down something unintentionally.
---
Military wing?
---
Do you know if Pipe Pistol w/Rifle stock works with the automatic perks such as guerrilla and commando?
---
Bethesda isn’t a person, it’s a triple A multimillion dollar company. They screwed up on the drop rates for the rare masks and no one has reported getting a single one after 4 days. This isn’t being entitled this is giving honest and deserved criticism for a game that consistently screws up every patch. 
---
&gt; I understand completionism and all that, I enjoy having unique items, but I won't be bummed if I don't get everything available. Hell they'll probably do it again next year anyway. I'd rather look forward to the joy of getting something that's surprising.
---
I know some people play to collect and are completionist. This isn't about if that's right or wrong. 
---
The real question becomes, is this how the game/event was designed? It's not, really. There's no reward, trophy or anything of that nature for getting all the masks. 
---
So in this case, wanting to collect them all, is a personal choice. That's fine. Put then complaining the game isn't giving you want you want, when it wasn't designed or meant to be played that way. Yes, you can play it for that end goal. But chances are, you are going to be disappointed when it doesn't happen. 
---
From an outside perspective you are the one acting like an idiot and getting downvoted to hell and back for your ignorance. Maybe try stop acting like a petulant child?
---
It'd be nice if the game didn't let you pick an additional one up.  Just left it there so you could come back later.
---
Just wanna chime in here and say I love your username BAYBEEEEE!
---
CAMP defenses are a bit of a joke against lvl 60 enemy npcs though. Can’t see them doing much to someone in power armour, let alone a sniper in stealth picking off bits.
---
Proposed solution, long in the necessity: Upgradeable camp defenses to the point that even X-01s have to consider the heavy lasers carefully.
---
Perhaps implementing a variation of a GTA V Online mechanic might be in order? If enough people vote to kick someone from a server for that type of behavior?  This particular event is supposed to be a collaborative event for for ALL levels in attendance.
---
Just shooting from the hip here, so to speak. 
---
My issue is. I understand the point of the rare masks. But for the percentage to be so low that they will grind all week and not be able to get a rare mask. That's some pretty big bullshit. And stupid from the Devs really, how unbelievabley disheartening to grind like crazy for nothing.
---
They have literally asked for feedback (even in the most recent inside the vault about survival). 
---
Telling people not to share their perspectives on reddit or any other forum doesn't make sense to me - what else is it for? 
---
I'd agree with that in survival mode maybe. 
---
My level 15 character was doing fine yesterday. The level 999 power armor guys were all clustered at the robots while I was out sniping supermutant suiciders single handedly. Leg shot first, kids.
---
Yes, that is the idea actually (I think).  You can finish the "end-game" quest line and get rewarded with ability to craft a fully modded hunting rifle for use by your next character and give you an edge.  But alas, the TSE Duping made the rifle obsolete.   People just buy a TSE for their alt.  Kinda sad.
---
damn even the trolls whine
---
God, could you imagine the game if they took and used all the suggestions? Everybody flying around in vertibirds, or tamed scorchbeasts, cars, and trains. Everybody's weapons both buffed and nerfed at the same time. Players getting immediately banned because they looked at another player the wrong way, yet immediately unbanned if they make a post on Reddit. Three separate camps, a larger town one, the normal one, and a smaller mobile one. Three star legendary drops on every kill so that by level 5 everybody has end game gear. And of course each and every vendor has a separate 10,000 cap pool that resets every hour- so I have to spend most of my time crafting top hats just to raise the required 100,000,000 caps needed to buy a baked bloatfly recipe. Ha!
---
Sure there are a lot of silly suggestions, and a lot of good ones. But sometimes it's best to have one person or group have the vision or direction, rather than a game founded by committee and popular opinion.
---
I Agree with you 100%
---
I do the same except I leave 1 water purifier locked so I have something XD besides that everything is open to everybody!
---
Until the community, which is excellent at exploiting the various metas to their advantage, finds a way around that. We've already seen a lot of people pitch ideas for how to get around this build. I think we'll be fine. I just see those gods as big challenges now.
---
I've found him spawned in the wall behind where he normally stands on multiple occasions. Had to target the wall at just the right spot to trade with him. 
---
Wow. Now I'm really kind of annoyed at everyone doing this. I'll see if anyone runs off into the woods next time just the before the beginning of the event and follow them. 
---
In an homage to Bluebeard I hope!
---
Glad you're doing this for people. If you are still doing this in a week, I can donate flux and other supplies.
---
Reminds me of the hats on TF2 and how salty some players used to get.
---
I've given up on the masks and just doing it for the camp items now.
---
There are two main approaches to this problem. One is trying to make it fair so that the numbers that back up each different players are similar. The other type of games allow you to increase and allocate the numbers yourself and build something that fits your needs.
---
Its not "forcing meta", its forced evolution virus, adapt or die, be good or be loot. If you want a game where the math aligns and is fair I suggest traditional FPS genre. In RPGs its always advanced rock paper scissors.
---
Raw is not the problem, Hardened Mass is. Seems like the drop rate has been greatly reduced. In several nuked WS events I barely got any, maybe 1 out of ten meat piles. Majority are just ionized meat. Dear Bethesda could you give us less meat and more mass so we can keep working? 
---
I have to second the preachy bit. 
---
I get what he was saying (I guess) but he didnt even understand the comment that he was being snide towards. 
---
I get so annoyed when people climb up on a high horse that they dont even comprehend 
---
Truth!
---
smoking is bad, don't you know? XD
---
Maybe? I’m not sure. The only mutation I have is speed demon. Makes The Dragon more efficient. As far as stealth goes, I figured it was just a combination of stuff that I hadn’t used yet myself. 
---
I’m stumped on the lack of wanted status for them.
---
You believe what you want. You think your belief is better than facts. You think that what you know is the only truth. Have fun with that. 
---
Then tagspam  [u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann) [u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek) et al and beg them to push Bethesda for this feature. I'm under the impression that every PC user has it installed; it's amazing being able to swap from animal-taming rifleman to scrounging, super-duping crafter with two keystrokes.
---
Haha absolutely! 
---
I've had major performance problems on PC since the last patch including disconnects. It can take at least 10 minutes for the game world to finish loading everything. So I can't just server hop for find plastic because I have no idea if the stuff is actually there or not.
---
I spawned in at the start of a parade and could not participate until the parade was almost over. I saw all the other players. No robots though. I could tell what tasks the players were performing, but could not help out.
---
I'm not asking for assn/sent to be removed form the game, just toned down so that I do more than 1 damage per shot. That's just absurd.
---
The legendary vendor will probably make it more likely to get TSE, but they should still be far more scarce than how it is today with all of the shoes ones around. You’d still have to rely on chance with that vendor and hopefully it’s balanced well. I just want to avoid past exploiters 
---
I like the glitched ones that just randomly appear on the ground near my camp. Can't pick em up tho 😑
---
How braindead does someone have to be to think "Two-Shot Explosive" means it 2 shots everything. The writer of that article has clearly never played Fallout 4, the game that introduced legendaries.
---
You seem to be upset that people are suggesting a fresh start to a new game mode,  it's pretty clear you have items that you have obtained from exploits.  Sorry champion but I don't cheat in any game so 'buying items' isn't an option, I wouldn't know where to go nor would I even if I did.  I play a video game as they're intended to be played. 
---
If you don't want to start a character again then don't.  You can enjoy playing your whatever level character with your exploited gear as it is right now.  There is nothing that you have said anywhere that makes any sense at all.  Sorry.
---
So many beautiful stories because there was not push to talk. But yeah it was satanic move!! Die bethesda for making us talk with random people!
---
I laughed
---
'You don't have any way of verifying those posts and observations. For something to be valid, you have to be able to verify the results. How do you verify someone who says they have done the event over 40 times, when the event had only been going for 24 hours and runs every hours. Sure there's server hoping. But that would mean being really lucky, and spending 24 hours playing and getting 2-3 events in an hour with really lucky server hopping. Or maybe the more likely explanation is the person lost track, or is exaggerating.   
---
As for what Bethesda has said. I already said that. So to go back to my point about things that you can verify, and what people say. Notice how you used something I said to try and discredit what I said, even though I agree with that being the only real information we have to work with?'
---
This comment of yours found just above, seems to contradict the one that I am replying to. Am I missing something?
---
Agreed. People are too reactive and only think of their current predicament or how they think it should work.  This is why I support things like PVP even though I rarely engage in it.  I learned a long time ago the importance of playing devil's advocate and trying to understand all perspectives, not just my own biases.  Not just in this game but in life in general.

He's more of a fallout news channel in my eyes. Plus some of his videos go over new content and lists reasons why you should or shouldn't get back into FO76.

Why would I need to verify all posts, particularly where the shared evidence aligns with data mining reports, my own experience, my friends' experience and the developer's own statements? Most all of every human's knowledge is sourced (not primary experience). 
---
I'm sorry, but that's not how validity works in statistics or analytics. 
---
I’ve gotten three of the old man winter effigy plans so far, have done the event about 25 times. It’s more rare, but not super rare. I’m on PS4 or is sell you one

Any pieces of armor that transfer damage to attackers?

but why tho? Just a nigga having some fun

Awesome! I hope to be. It’s been great meeting people!
---
Pretty sure they were referring to the Unstoppables Atomic Shop event, where if someone in your team had an unstoppables outfit on, you would get a small AP buff, up to 60 max iirc.
---
Very minimum, I honestly cant tell a difference in accuracy  between the mutation with maxed class freak and no mutation.
---
Just wanted to say I’m sorry. After reading through all the posts, I see that I was mistaken in assuming you were trying to scam people out of caps when they could make their own for free. I didn’t know you had found the plan in another spot and that someone had offered to buy it from you for 1k caps. 
---
Also, it’s really none of my business what you do with your game. I could’ve made a separate post telling people where to get the plans if I was that concerned about it. 🤷‍♀️ 
---
Everything I said is factually accurate. Bethesda is not a person = fact.
---
They introduce new glitches and bugs every single patch = fact. 
---
So what am I wrong about? 
---
I absolutely will do that
---
not if you stack up 6 different power armors in a row 
---
Someone saying they saw one without anything to back it up is like the exact opposite of verified. Sure, some of the fervor is uncalled for, but I don't think it's unreasonable at all for people to be getting tired of unfulfilled promises or outright lies.

Yes. Very annoying for people who actually play the game past level 50

Not for me. I use deep pocketed leather chest piece and legs with life saving ultra light leather arms. Basic stuff.
---
The game doesn't resonate well with youth I have found. They do not enjoy preparation and burdensome systems and reading. I bring the game up at work and the younglings have all the same bullet points the hate click media exacerbated back in november and refuse to play for themselves. The one good thing is that it opened my eyes to the situation that hate meta can generate. Now game news or media can fuck right off, ZERO clicks for you. Now that any douche with a cell phone and reddit account can basically slander for clicks as an "affiliate." 
---
Right?  I've run into a few of those.  Probably that damn prize bot dropping them.  I can see him giving out a useless tech data.
---
Most of oopsies were done by marketing, not developers.
---
Journalism isn't even journalism anymore. It's always just black and white, whether it be Left vs. Right, or bandwagoning on hating a game, or even calling people racists or sexists or transphobic or whatever they want to try at getting clicks and scratching up someone's rep.
---
I open my browser before starting the game then with the perks open in the game I Alt + Tab between them. When I want to alter a loadout I copy the web address from the perkloadout.ini  into the browser so it loads it then make changes and copy new address back to the .ini file. It is a bit more trouble than in game saves but it works pretty good once you get it down.
---
Why are you so sure about that?
---
 Well, you know, it’s perfectly understandable people don’t understand what the game is. I mean, Bethesda only released a making of a documentary, explained it in detail at last 3E3, and provided more pre-release info and extensive interv play footage than with any other game in their history. 
---
Yup, totally agree.  I get item rarity and it's importance.  But taking 5 of 10 masks and making them near impossible to get during a one week event is just ludicrous design.  If they picked 1-2 masks, especially old man winter, and made it Uber rare.  Cool.  But half the masks being this way is strange.
---
This event makes me _really_ wish VATS wouldn’t target friendlies. I’m pretty sure _I_ took down some of the robots in recent runs.
---
You still dont have it? I can craft it on PC and you can cheaply buy serums on reddit if you are not PC

Interested in this conspiracy theory 🧐 let’s hear it 👂

SLAP system is fo76's equivalent to a duel challenge. Requesting a duel is acceptable behavior.
---
Yeah, mothers always listen to your great ideas! (Jokin)
---
You need to first tame a creature and then get a Scorchbest to attack your Camp with its green radioactive mist. This turns regular creatures into scorched versions. I haven't tested this myself yet, but it should work on pets aswell. 
---
Just don't let Peta find out...
---
Hello copycat!
---
Nah I'm  joking. Support this 100% The more people yelling the better.
---
I'll add this to yours tho. I'd also like to be able to disable the PICK A CARD thing when I level up. I'm 136 now and i just don't need to do that every time or be reminded each of the 30 times I'll swap on a Friday night.
---
Everyone saying its not hard, i know, i get it. Its kinda quick when your used to it. The problem is when your farming and crafting, then fighting, you spend a LOT of time looking at your pip boy instead of going on adventures. 3 minutes in camp doing a few swaps to craft and repair isn't anything. It probably takes longer to go grab a drink and take a whiz. After 136 levels though that time has added up drastically.
---
Just lock it to camp and out of combat, a stash box you can access at most. That should really help keep it fair.
---
I wasn't blocking on purpose. I was just showing everyone my six sets up power armor 
---
"20-30 minutes"
---
My point is that who cares if he is in your bworkbench wasting his own time? Pop down another one and do your thing, let him stand there. "The reward they are looking for" is people getting angry like you.
---
I have rto agree on that. It is the best mod out there. Bethesda needs to add it to the game for everyone.
---
You don't need a high level to take out the suiciders. I one shot them with an under level 30 toon I'm rolling. I use a level 25 lever action.
---
So you are pissing off others and then get annoyed by them being angry at you?
---
and the entire playerbase
---
Usually use a mini nuke on that wave and the scattered remains shotty 
---
They are usually PVP traps.   Those players are cap farming you.   Yeah, they could be wearing full suit of Sentinel armors and unless you know about critting/staggering them, you could not do much damage at all to them.
---
Your Character gets better and stronger as it's leveled however, it's not a race and your only real competition is with your own problem solving skills. For example if Food and Water is your issue then think about where placing your CAMP will best solve that problem. When I needed more Critical Damage as I was leveling my budding Sniper I placed my CAMP in a place where Firecracker Berries were abundant. 
---
Start in the Military Wing at the Armory, but be sure to check the Production Wing also, once a GREAT while something useful shows up there.
---
The issue is, that same assn/sent guy can on shot me if i don't have full assn/sent. So if you DON'T run full assn/sent, you're just a free kill.
---

There is an xp boost in survival for everyone, fast travel is limited to vault76, camp, workstations and train stations. look up "inside the vault"

Thanks for the tip
---
Agree.  I’m probably quite alone in this, but if I were lead designer on this game, I wouldn’t have included legendary weapons at first. 
---
This is not feedback in most cases, but anoying spam, thats my problem. Also comenting something you didn't experienced is stupid.
---
"Shark taste like cow, because i did eat smurf, so i know." - see? There is no logic
---
I'm not one for personal attacks or telling bethesda to die, even if you meant it to be a joke. If the best you have is make up a scenario that anyone who criticizes bethesda is like telling them to die, then you don't really have a good  point to make, do you?
---
Suggestions and criticisms should we always fine, they are meant for bethesda, even if  you, or the op, is tired of reading them. I haven't seen any pvp criticisms personally attacking bethesda, nor telling them to die - you claiming as such is FAR worse. 
---
There's a mod that does this way better than what BTSD could ever implement. Just use it.
---
Agreed OP, some will get lucky and others are going to walk away with nothing more than memories of fun, but no one is entitled to a freaking cosmetic skin just because they showed up.
---
So if you weren't in a group, didn't have a workshop captured, no aoe mutations or armor, had pacifist on and the player didn't walk in front if your shots, this sounds like something new.  Especially since there was no wanted level attached, which is even more confusing.  This sounds like a legitimate issue if all the criteria I mentioned is correct ( and I didn't miss anything ) .  I'd recommend filing a bug report with Bethesda, if you haven't already.
---
How do you tag them? Or could you just do it on mine as well? I think mines up there on the Hot Chart.
---
Thanks code_monkey

ALSO. I only have 1 beret my bad lol I thought I got one last night before I got off.

where is the hook up for poseidon in the Charleston scrap yard?
---
I agree with you about the event designed to be fun for all.   It reminds me of days gone by from growing up in a small town.  This game is fun, and  clever.
---
It is such a great mask
---
Yesterday I had tons of issues. All since the last updated I get kicked 2-3 a session. PS4.
---
So you’re comparing misinformation to a title that doesn’t give the entire picture and saying those are the same? I’m honestly not even sure which video title you’re talking about, after looking I didn’t see it. This of course all being from over 2 months ago 
---
I think my content has changed, but if you don’t I understand as to why you would feel that way 
---
Apparently it was fixed , do thanks anyway
---
I.. may know of this group.  Send me a PM?  I'd like to compare notes.
---
kinda like FO4.   say you liked it and FONV fanboys would swarm ya for liking a "not RPG"
---
I asked this before when I realized that the shack windows with the broken glass hinder your vision but allow bullets pass through.
---
Ok and 6 months from now? And a year from now when it’s all back should we wipe for a few new players? They won’t ever solve duping. full stop. 
---
 There are already new duping methods for the existing patch. Accept it. 
---
It could be disputably named harrasment if you slap-spam-killed the player, followed them wherever they go and continued slap-spam-killing them while throwing insults.
---
What you did was perfectly acceptable.
---
The guy on the other hand should be muted.
---
Again it’s like you’re just reiterating everything I say. I know all this dude, I’ve got over 1k hours logged, there’s nothing new you can tell me.
---
Then by this statement, people are saying they have seen a mask in game. So that means the masks drop. They are just very rare. Like Bethesda said. 
---
So you only validate that which you personally experience. And anyone else's statements are false. Especially if they disagree with what you want to think. 
---
Which is very key. What you want to think. And so you are going to do is find that which supports what you want to think, and dismiss anything that doesn't support. 
---
And you are probably thinking, that's what I'm doing too. 
---
But I'm not. I'm saying, I don't have any information that is can be verified. Even what Bethesda has said, I can't verify. But they have only said that the masks are in game. There's just a really low chance of them dropping. Which was as they designed it. 
---
The guy that datamined. How do you know he was correct? How do you know he told the truth? I mean, you don't even know who he is. You know nothing about him. But you are willing to believe what he tells you. 
---
And yet, you are telling how validity and statistics and analytics work? You just said you accepted what someone you don't know told you as the truth. Why? Because it supports what you want to believe. 
---
So you've seen the rare masks then? Of course you haven't.
---
You must be new to the internet if you've never used the work bullshit or ridiculous when you weren't angry lol.
---
Honestly I think the best thing for workshop PvP woud be a prompt for the owner saying "x is under attack, do you wish to defend it? Yes No
---
Maybe you should read around the post a bit, no point in repeating myself.
---
Well just a tip then since you sooo invested...They are non-existent. 
---
I was wondering if that was a glitch or what. Honestly hope it isn't fixed. Would love to rock it.
---
I hope if they do that there is a way to flag friends to prevent it 
---
I'm truly shocked that Bethesda would of had the for thought to consider adding that mechanic in
---
Also pretty short range ICBMs :)
---
You are completely right, this subreddit is either run by Bethesda employees or shills. 
---
Even when they are supposed too
---
Wildly inappropriate reference: Check
---
Insulting name for people enjoying the game: Check
---
"lmao" at their own 'wit': Check
---
Troll confirmed. Do not feed.
---
Your point goes both ways. Someone can't say, I haven't seen one so that means I'm right, and then when someone says they have, say, well that can't be true because I didn't see it personally.
---
Performance, is my guess. Trust me, I like architecting "real-world" as possible (no floating platforms or unsupported structures, homes need interior walls, bathrooms, plumbing shares the wetwall, etc. ) but this suggestion would make the texture maps variable, and as a programmer, that make me shudder a little. 
---
This game will never be modded fo 4, unfortunately!
---
VATS is useless because it targets all the **players** around the event. By the time I can pick out one of the wolves or bugs, someone else has killed them.
---
I’ve been asking for that for every game foeer
---
😊haha violet flux was so elusive to me for the longest time. It was the bane of my existence. Then I found out stabilizing it was even worse and then I realized I should’ve made my username hardened mass instead lol.
---
Didn't realize Bethesda made the last SR game.
---
And my statement was about bugs. What specifically are they doing to trigger bugs and server disconnects.  How could I possibly be playing differently to have almost no bugs while others apparently run into so many. How can my shitty internet that is part of a shared box in an apartment complex which limits our internet speed significantly to the point if we are both watching youtube at the same time the download speed on my PS4 will drop to below 1mbps download.   
---
Dude, if the drill still works after nuclear bomb, that \*is\* legendary.
---
It lets you vats someone using a stealthboy.
---
Advantage if you can trick your enemy into your murder shack, but if you intend to live there not so great
---
Post it in the "find a group" channel on the /r/market76 discord. I come to all of those if I'm on, and I can solo the queen easily.
---
I traded two god items I dropped so far to get my god-gear. Two of my armor pieces I bought from reddit for less than 3k caps combined, yet I'd never sell them for less than 25k or a god-item. Not every god out there is a dupe lord and its insulting to dedicated players to say so.
---
They need to add more build pieces or it is going to be an ugly mess
---
I'd be ok with that. 
---
Might have to figure out where he spawns and toss down a low damage mine or something, just to get a tag in.
---
Oh shit! Mute! 
---
I shoulda thought of that lol. 
---
Im an idiot.
---
Yeah, there are definitely more TSE weapons out there than should be.  However the current meta "boomed" after the duping ban. People are paying out the ass for bloodied handmade rifles now.  Imaging being in stealth I the woods, stalking a player with a bounty, you have 2 hp left for Max bloodied damage, and shoot his head from sneak as soon as he starts walking (to make sure he has no bonus from sentinel and cavalier). I think that will be much more deadly than two shot or explosive.  (I recently gave up a TSE for bloodied rifle myself lol) 
---
I'm not clear on how you expect more scientific evidence than we have.  It is what we have and it clearly backs up the experiences being shared by those on the forum.  I agree that people should lighten up and just have fun, but I also agree that the drops are clearly TOO rare.  In the end I honestly don't even care about getting them, but it isn't my job to tell other people what they should care about.
---
You run no armor? How much is the damage increase?
---
I feel your pain! Same thing is happening to me! 
---
That would be great
---
Yes it does.  If one person in group is spotted, everyone is spotted, regardless of who is stealth.
---
Ahhhh, I think I mis-interpreted your comment. I thought you were saying that OP's "Except this one" comment was asinine, as you replied to that instead of the actual post - and to me it was clear that the "Except this one" comment was a joke.
---
Having read your comments I think your "asinine" was directed at OP's idea of in-game polling booths rather than their "Except this one" comment. I certainly don't believe the polling booth idea was written ironically.
---
With that clarification out of the way, I agree that polling booths might be a bit silly. But the fundamental issue - that places like Reddit represent a subset of the user base that is likely not representative of the entire population of people playing the game, and hence may not give feedback representative of what the entire user base wants - seems like a very real one to me. A feedback mechanism built into the game (or game menu before you click "play", or even just the launcher) doesn't strike me as an absurd way of dealing with that issue.
---
Of course, some basic training in statistics introduces the idea of the law of large numbers: a few hundred or few thousand observations, as long as they are appropriately sampled, tells you about as much as you would get from surveying the entire population. So Bethesda can probably get information almost as reliable as a full in-game survey feature just from a well designed email survey.
---
My game runs fine and so do most people’s, they increased stability bulky 300%, probably your internet
---
If these masks are actually dropping then we would see proof, it would be easy to verify, there would be videos. Instead we have you mindlessly chanting that someone’s friend’s cousin’s brother’s dog saw someone with a rare mask. 
---
Finally someone on PC :) I’ll be adding you tonight. 
---
Number the list of active quests in the upper right, and put those numbers in the compass.
---
Lol, I am pure decoration. I havent even bothered with learning to make turrets tougher than heavy mg, myself.
---
Surely the cursing makes it more immersive for you as a raider? I guess at the end of the day if you can’t take the heat join the Responders lol
---
Yeah the thing is 90% of the time, I dont even want to defend the workshop, its either been left to me by a teammate who is not playing now or I claimed for a challenge or something
---
Want me be honest? I forgot about in-game mute too. What I said was a "ban light" version where a player is allowed to play but not to use area chat.
---
Sounds good!
---
It's two shot assassins I'll take 250
---
Nope. But my lack of seeing something doesn't mean I'm right anymore than it makes you right. Get it? I doubt you do. 
---
&gt;No one is owed a rare mask. That's not the point of this event. It's to have fun.
---
This type of mindset is exactly what makes it NOT FUN.   There's a difference between rare and virtually non-existent. 
---
For a good while, the T51 jetpack plans  didn't exist, for all intents and purposes.   A recent patch made the plans a permanent item at the Watoga vendor that costs over 6,000 caps and requires stable flux to build. 
---
Did making it a permanent item at the vendor make it a common item that you see everywhere?  
---
No.  
---
I never see ***anyone*** wearing them.   The high cost and uncommon materials require an amount of grinding that most people are not willing to do.
---
So the item is now rare, whereas it was previously  unobtainable. 
---
The irony is that this kind of RNG crap is what lead to rampant duping and selling items for real- world currency on ebay, in which case items intended to be 'rare' were suddenly not rare at all. 
---
Thing is, AQ was a unique event, as in after the first person to complete on a server it was no longer obtainable. Thats not even close to the same thing as having a drop rate so low that most players will never see it. Not to mention AQ had incredibly challenging fun time investments and prerequisites, whereas this is about the equivalent to the WoW easter event or some shit.
---
Misread your comment to mean first game, not specifically Bethesda, my bad.
---
I think this shot is much better. [https://imgur.com/QmE3EwZ](https://imgur.com/QmE3EwZ)
---
Sadly you're right. It's all opinion pieces designed to drum up hate disguised as news. Impartial and bipartisan news reporting is a thing of the past.
---
Nah, that's ok. I've dealt with worse than you, lol. Sorry to burst your badass bubble there, sport.
---
ITT: User asks people not to be jerks; is in fact a jerk. 
---
I saw one, personally, in game.  I posted as much and hot down voted.  I seriously don't care enough to "provide proof," because even if I do everyone will just say that they got it from the dev room.  There is literally no proof that people will accept, short of actually getting the drop themselves.
---
Honestly, he may not know it's a thing. I didn't. Now I know if I get slapped there's a reason. I thought it was just because I'm a girl gamer lol.
---
Max is 50% from what I've heard, not confirmed tho
---
Well why was he standing there? Everyone else left. This was 10 minutes after the event. Trades were over. 
---
People don't seem to realize that sometimes limitations can make things better. A rare drop is a rare drop for a reason. When I first started one of my goals was to collect every plan and recipe. I abandoned that when they made it so every vendor always had every plan they sold. There was no point in collecting them- if I wanted I could walk in and buy it any time. The fun of a game comes from being able to figure out how to get around obstacles and limitations. 
---
What if....
---
The secret Chinese spy base in Appalachia held the Chinese Liberty Prime (yes it's a thing, it's on propaganda posters). There could be events based around taking it down. Just the image of a towering robot speaking Chinese while liberators fill the air around it. 
---
I gotten rid of the beserkers one and found this one two shot assassins 
---
My group killed a 3* star sloth at the event, I tagged it multiple times, nothing dropped at all. Not mad, just chuckled and went on my way. 
---
I think having the option to bring in existing will make the mode more interesting.  It seems built for drop in / drop out fighting.
---
Oh yeah I guess the Mr. Handy IS a robot isn't he? LOL. I didn't even think about that part.
---
Flagging the whole team was a fix to other problems caused by how it was, which is what you are suggesting they go back to.
---
Shit 90% of the time I get my plan rewards and server hop for more workshops and plans that is unless I'm farming fusion cores.
---
I never said that I accepted reports as truth. I take them as evidence. Some evidence is stronger. Some evidence is weaker. You say that you don't take reports as evidence. I find that scientifically unsound, but it seems we're at an impasse. 
---
Well, the not spoiling is nice, but whenever I run low, I take over the Sunshine Meadows industrial farm and make (no-rad) Salisbury Steaks.  I do it in the middle of the night when nobody is going to kill me for the workshop and harvest about 100 or so and then I'm good for a few weeks.
---
i think I have an extra sausage plan, are you on PC by chance?
---
Good idea, however, it's not achievable with the 'current technology' available in the Fallout world. Only monochromatic displays are invented there. 
---
That takes away the risk element
---
Ok maybe if you want to be pedantic, but we haven't seen any confirmation as a community. Kinda sways the devil's advocacy toward the far fetched realm.
---
At this point where the event is basically half over, there should be at least one confirmed drop of a rare mask, and I can't see how that's an unreasonable stance. No one's talking about right or wrong, people just want to see a feature that was promised actually come to fruition.
---
Well then I'm sure you know someone who has at least seen someone with those 5 masks right?
---
Agreed
---
You got extremely lucky then. In 400 hours I've found 2 good weapons - a bloody / 25% / 90% wt reduction cryolator and a bloody / explosive / vats harpoon gun. It took farming 5,000+ legendaries to get those. I could maybe get a single assn/sent piece for each, and then I'd have no good pvp guns.
---
This is exactly what I mean. When presented with evidence, if it goes against what people WANT to believe. 
---
Thanks for saying this. Be prepared for people to say it was a duped mask from the dev room. 
---
Oh, I hit every meat pile in every nuke zone and hoard that stuff. So I have a large stockpile. But that does seem a lot less than I am getting, for sure!
---
Perfect and yes that was my inference. 
---
Wish I could, I don't think any of my friends would care about the game enough to bother with the reddit... orz... part of why I came here to discuss the game more LOL
---
This may be a dumb question but how do you lock/unlock them I never see a prompt for it
---
Same here 
---
Best spent single point in the game!
---
I have that mod installed, it made my experience much much more enjoyable, and I refuse to play without it.
---
I need you in my Appalachian life.
---
Can you wait a day before you start to drone against feedback?
---
Anytime you get a bunch of people in one place in this game everyone has to prove something. It's a low level sloth, it only gives level 30 legendaries, why are the high levels dead set on obliterating it within two seconds?  I'm high level and I don't feel the need to obliterate it immediately. I do feel the need to get shots in because I always want to loot stuff but it's become a thing to see how fast you can kill it and it makes no sense
---
Given that me alone, I've done the quest one after another on 10hr plays at a time and I have not one rare mask, neither has anyone else with tangible proof, I you DO get a rare one you would have to be demented to sell it for caps, I think bethesdas idea was to create a buzz around trade in the market place. 
---
Did he? As far as I can tell, the Marchers are immune to player damage. I've shot them in vats (accidentally and on purpose), thrown grenades right in the middle of them, etc., and not noticed any damage.
---
Your right.  I felt relieved ( no pun intended ) when I found the toilet plans after looking forever for them.  Now most plans are easy buys.  Less satisfaction.  People just want what they want, consequences be damned.
---
well. Considering every part of this even is collecting things and turning them in I had the idea that after the event, you'll be able to turn in a full set of the common masks for a rare one. This is based on nothing and probably not gonna happen. But it crossed my mind so Im keeping all of them for now.
---
Personally, I think this is better than when someone built a working computer in Minecraft.
---
So what you’re telling me is that you sat there slapping this guy after he told you to get bent and then got your feelings hurt when he was annoyed by it? Ok buddy 
---
I'm the asshole that secures every door ;) gotta keep the balance in check haha
---
What if it's more about the robots health level at the end? I have yet to play a round where they each have 100% health. Did lose one though and still got a mask. I'd like to hear about someone getting them through at full health.
---
a cooldown to swapping is an easy fix to that fam
---
If you are on PC and the harpoon is for sale then I'm interested xD
---
OP is @L12, I would recommend avoiding whitesprings.  Nuked to often, and too easy to lose all the junk hes working hard to collect.
---
No just true PvP not PvTeam. Anyone with a few buddies can rake in caps through these methods. Note I didn't say exploits it's a perfectly fine way of playing and getting caps and is completely within the current ruleset.
---
Took the words right out of my mouth, thank you good sir. 
---
Damn that actually makes sense 
---
Awesome I have to check over there and look for it.
---
I have one.  Took 3 days of (granted, pretty light) farming to find it in his inventory.  Not sure it was worth the ~900 caps though.
---
I think he spawned about 15 times before the coat was there.
---
But yeah, load/fast travel to Charleston, run south to the bridge (you only need to go a little ways onto the bridge, just past the telephone pols), and turn around to see what spawned, if anything.
---
To break up the monotony, and get a few caps for the trouble, go across the bridge and kill the Grafton (?) monster that spawns nearby.  ~15-20 caps and a few supplies x 200 respawns makes the pain a little more bearable.
---
What if it's the opposite? I've played a few rounds not seeing anyone hit any balloons and nothing special. Need to do a test each way and see. Wouldn't hurt.
---
Mine do but then have to be way close.
---
See I can get behind this kind of Raider Play, it fits thematically and allows others to opt in or out, hell if I saw you I would have given you the stimpaks to keep the RP going lol!
---
What system are you on? I have an extra I wouldn't mind letting go for cheap
---
You obviously do not use a minigun, or those would be gone in an hour.  JK
---
That's beeswax and there are actually 5 in the front room and 5 in the side room.  Hut actual honeycomb drops from the honeybeasts
---
Disclaimer:  600+ hours in game, but don't plan on doing survival.
---
With that said I agree 100% that this new game mode should require you to start with a lvl 1 and not be able to share gear or anything else from your account.  This new would needs to be just that, NEW.  This would allow a fair and somewhat balanced start for everyone and reset the economy for that mode.   Diablo 3 does this sorta with "seasons".  Each season you start from scratch.  Each season there is always some sort of goal "equipment bonus", blah blah blah.  This keeps a game well over 4 years old FRESH.  I'm afraid that if they do not require a restart then it's going to get old soon as all the geared out guys run around slaying everything.  
---
I just assumed, as who'd make such things intended for their own continent? ;)
---
Nice try Mega Sloth
---
Wow. Smh
---
Ugh. Wish you were on PS4. Or I had a gaming PC set up. #goals
---
Imagine if this was your reaction to literally anything in life. Dude needs a therapist.
---
To call the low droprate unverifiable and everything surrounding it false might be a bit of a stretch. I get the sentiment of not really caring so much about it - it *is* just an in-game item in the end - but the datamined numbers were backed considerably well by the poll, and the low droprate displayed by both of them verified by a [comment from Bethesda themselves.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3r5hr/fasnacht_mask_drop_rate_poll_results/ej2kouz/)
---
It being less fun is a bit subjective. Your stance on that is valid, and I won't knock it, but I don't hold it to be any more reasonable than the point that being told that the rare masks are so rare that they're nearly unobtainable even if you nolife the parade for the entire week kind of takes a bit of the fun out of coming back once you've got the common masks and plans.
---
There's still time for it to be changed, yeah - personally, I hope they do.
---
I can't believe the first 3 replies were nice. I'm very disappointed.
---
I barely ever get Kicker from the server. The problem must be with you somewhere.
---
That’s how I was with Skyrim back in the day. Got tired of hearing about all the great mods so I went and built myself a gaming pc. Best decision I could have made. 
---
Oh ok cool
---
Well it's a good thing "here" isn't their job is it? Good lord man, it's a fucking discussion forum. What the hell do you think people are going to do?
---
I want Shutters for my Brick Walls and Metal Walls. Also glass windowed walls, curtains, garden plots for a hanging garden on the edge of my windows, interior wallpaper options (cover the ugly wood/metal frames and not have wall mounted objects clip through), Non-broken glass windows walls and roofing (I want a skylight to stargaze).
---
And no I’ve never really thought about their health being a certain amount maybe could affect RNG. 
---
Hmm.  Does radiation go through foundation walls?
---
\^ Troof. I've never seen it, myself. 
---
People want the narrative spoonfed into their mouths.
---
"tHiS GaMe Is A JoKe"
---
It's a joke if you have no imagination.
---
Is it just me or are scariest bits in the game the notes and terminal logs after operation touchdown, in which the people report hundreds of scorchbeasts in the sky?
---
Like if I saw that in real life I'd freeze out of shock, probably have a heart attack. Picturing the fear they experienced gives me chills. 
---
But isn't that every online game? Even the core of this game?
---
 Extra points for the golf motif.  This,  sir,  might be your finest role play immersive citation.  However,  my favorite still remains your most evil,  the oven.  You're awesome! 
---
Exactly how I'm feeling with Fallout. Read thru here sometimes and I'm like "you can do what!?!?"
---
Because the majority of people on reddit are just haters... is there a new game? in reddit you will see a few days of Joy and then Hate Hate Hate...  because most people will be playing instead of complaining or hating in reddit
---
You seem to forget that “rare” is not the same thing as “nearly unobtainable”. 
---
I disagree. I think it's cool that there's something that you can't guarantee getting just from grinding. Some people will just get lucky and most won't. I'm okay with that.
---
Player hubs. Player hubs as far as the eye can see.
---
No worries. 
---
I stand on top of that truck over by where the  sloth spawns spamming the "Come here" emote so at least the low level players and newbies know where to go so they can tag the sloth. Usually works.
---
friend do you think I'm talking about stuff like the friggin' nylon bag? LOL come on now.
---
I am referring to the myriad of bugged quests, glitched enemies and weapons, events that can't be completed, loot that can't be collected, server instability, valuable items lost from inventories, just the whole raft of problems that plagued this game and still do to a lesser extent, months after launch. Marketing lol smh
---
All I’ll say is “Perk Loadout Manager” :)
---
I finally hit 60. I don't play melee, but showed up to the event with a melee weapon. stayed in the back of the parade and I only remember killing 2 toads and meleeing the sloth. Never shot it and I hope others got to tag it. 
---
here is a screen cap of what happened [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b46761/someone\_was\_blocking\_the\_fasnacht\_parade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b46761/someone_was_blocking_the_fasnacht_parade/)
---
I heard if you block all the boys but the mr handy then the other bots don’t take damage, but the handy still triggers the progression 
---
Oh, certainly. Most of the mobs are lvl 10 ish , and I'm a huge fan of the .45 caliber machined guns.  But I've seen dynamics where the 100+ lvls all want to stand on the parade, and if noobs miss a suicider... a mini nuke in the parade is rough on the bots. From a strategy perspective, letting the low levels deal with the skirmishers while the high levels keep the real damage on the outskirts gives the bots a better chance to survive the final wave. 
---
Just make the entire map a player hub and we can all emote each other and mingle with scorched.  Ain't no party like a post apocalyptic party!
---
Item rarity is fine. But if you're grinding an event for dozens of hours with absolutely no pay off that's simply not fair. Making something hard to get unless you invest tons of time is ok if you actually get the reward for it. But people have been grinding for days now and nothing. Its absurd.
---
If they actually are in game and it's all random that means someone could do one parade and get a rare drop and someone else can grind 50 parades and never see one. It's the wrong way to go about it. 
---
Oh... my... gawd... 0.o
---
That seems like a possibility. I’ll file a bug report with Bethesda when I’m off work. We have videos from the attack giving different perspectives. This post was mostly just hoping that someone here would be able to explain it. 
---
If it’s an exploit that’s bled over from Survival, they were familiar with it. They were super confident in the approach and didn’t let up. 
---
/r/whoosh
---
Totally worth it
---
After the dev room scandal and no one else in the world having one? I've got my screenshot hotkey ready for when the quest ends and the loot is being dished out. 
---
I'm on Xbox. I'd be so grateful.
---
They updated the map with a bunch of new "no-build zones" as those areas are more than likely going to be used in future content releases. You guys were probably set-up in one of those zones.
---
I'm sorry, I'm not actually sure what you're getting at here... Can you clarify?
---
I am confused. The proposed fix is to return back to how things were, where only the owner and the person claiming the workshop flag correct?
---
&gt; Yes i know i egged him on
---
So who was the adult in this conversation exactly? It doesn't sound like anyone was.
---
The problem with tobacco is you stink after using it. Heavy smokers smell disgusting. They might not know it but they do. 
---
Haha!
---
Click on the actual challenge. It will give you a list of specific locations you have to take the photos at. The other regions it was anywhere but I know at least the Forrest was specific places.
---
Servers aren't the problem. I would likely suggest the problem is with either your Internet or your specs if you're on pc. 
---
What the FRAG?
---
Yeah, there's a big difference between some masks and half the masks.  My biggest issue isn't that some of them are rare, it's that 2 of them are supposed to be rare, and 3 of then unommon, and 5 common.  There is clearly something wrong with the drop rates, because of everything I've seen there are one or two players with old man winter, one or two with the sun mask, and exactly ZERO with any of the 3 supposedly uncommon masks. If these drop rates make any sense at all, shouldn't there be a significant number of uncommon drops even if the super rare ones are super rare?  That's fine, make one or two impossible to get.  But where are the other three masks?  Literally none have dropped that I have seen even a shred of evidence for.
---
I have no issues at all. Running on 100 Mbps internet, standard PS4 that's about 3 years old.
---
Occasional stuttering in high populated areas, a few bugs here and there (nothing game breaking or overly frustrating) and I haven't been disconnected from a server in about the last 25 hours of play
---
Ah, yeah hadn’t seen that on the others, but will have a look on the forest one, thanks.. easy atoms.
---
I've seen this a few times, and you are correct.  Mr Handy cant be stopped!
---
Dang,sucks it take away such a good spot for a newb. 
---
Not to say your opinion doesn't matter. But as a company generally, you would want to make the majority of your consumer base happy. And in this case I'd say majority of people would be happy with a healthy middle. Where your grinding guarantees maybe 1 or 2 rare masks (depending on how lucky you were). Compared the dramatic polar opposites. It being so easy, everyone gets everything, nothing has meaning. Or right now, where grinding feels like more work actually going to work and it's likely I'll blow my brains out at the end when I don't even get something out of it. 
---
I play games to escape from work. Not to find it 
---
yeah and alt+f4 so you couldn't get my trash. Pro tip if you also want to be bitch after showing some friends your cool power armor just drink some nukashine and run.
---
according to some people it’s because people were unbanned, and then the server stability got better after they were re banned. lol
---
Yeah, I've accidentally targeted them with my 50 cal and never did a bit of damage
---
Its weird having so many people in one place with their random outfits on usually its powerarmor while fighting the scorch queen but its nice
---
This event is not fun in the slightest. It was poorly done, they do have a good hype team though the screen caps.of it in the road maps and the announcements made me excited. I've done it 3 times and probably won't do it again. Get this get that escort the slowest robot type in a circle. I was expecting more. Make the attack waves scale with how many people are there. If they can scale the SBQ resistance by how many people ate there they can increase the number of mobs or difficulty of the mobs. This was a very disappointing event.
---
Not completely.  
---
Player A finds defender and hides nearby.
---
Player B contests workshop and fast travels to Player A, then kills defender.
---
How about: attacker and team and defender and team are only flagged for PVP after they each enter the PVP area?
---
 l u l 
---
Regardless of how it started, no wanted level, no vats targeting and lack of revenge spawning are huge red flags.
---
Take the plunge and upgrade from your 56k modem to some kind of broadband package
---
I want to just paint the hair on like those weird old today with the bald guy
---
Wait it already started? Was it In the WA update?
---
Are you me?  I'm a melee mothman cultist with an owl mask.
---
I probably do, won't be able to check until after 5pm EDT.  I have the All Rise already, so not sure which will be better, but would gladly trade away some 5mm ammo.
---
Username the same as my reddit.
---
I feel bad for the guy. But also annoyed by him. 
---
Raider vs raider people curse and gloat all the time. Thats different. Its good natured. 
---
You can tell when its nasty and someones upset. Most players left the area when he started screaming. They didnt leave because of a slap duel challenge...
---
I'm not angry...
---
You're correct, they are looking to get a rise out of people. The above situation would absolutely get a rise out of some people. If you are not one of them more power to you, but it is still an example of habbo hotel nonsense that griefers love.
---
did that last night to one of the runs.. he died, but just stood there.. Dropped nothing
---
Maybe we should upvote pvp posts..
---
I've been told by doctors that I need a kidney. Interested?
---
At least you're honest about what you are?
---
I've done it 4 times.. and I'm happier to get the recipes/plans.. Though I like the idea of the beret... To me the masks are just.. there. 
---
I'll be testing impenetrable builds this evening to learn that
---
Recipe drop is random and no robots need to be destroyed
---
Bethesda should've bumped up the health pool dependent on players within a certain proximity. That way it doesnt feel halfassed.
---
I'm starting a new character on survival for kicks. With 20%xp bonus I'll be able to reach my desired level quickly and have a new character fully specced for pvp and will hopefully get some sweet survival rewards along the way too. I think limiting fast travel and the added intensity will make survival just a more fun type of game to play
---
it is a mutation that basically works like a bloodied weapon.  the lower your health, the more damage you do.  it also stacks with the same benefit from a bloodied weapon.  the downside is that it lowers your max health.  not a big issue since my bloodied build runs at low HP all the time.
---
maybe the game was designed for subpar internet connections and has problems on good connections ...
---
...  what do i know ...
---
it is also not our job to find this out. bethesda has to deliver a product which satisfies the majority of the players and there are well known methods to gather the required data.
---
First week I played, My power armor disappeared when I got out of it.  That's why lol.  Not saying it's bad now, but it left a bad first impression for sure
---
You could probably use the pumpkin grenades, you get them from a daily quest at the pumpkin house.
---
It’s a combination of people who think they’re important not getting what they envisioned and being entitled brats, and weak people being easily influenced by strong people who know how to influence them.  You end up with all bias, few facts, haters who just need attention, lovers who just need attention, and no real objective dialogue.  It’s not just 76,  it’s all over, but 76 got abused hard for sure.
---
Look at rdr2 online comments these days,  even they’re getting roasted.  It blows my mind, all these amazing games I could only dream about as a kid and an entire community spends more time debating them, and arguing about them, and crying about them, than actually just playing them.  If they don’t like them, how about just not playing them and go away? It’s a video game.
---
People with HUNDREDS of hours of gameplay on a game whining about “not enough End Game” and “waste of my money.”   I can’t imagine how insufferable they must be when they see a movie they don’t like.  My advise to them is to get over themselves, don’t be so easily influenced by strangers with a YouTube channel, and to get bent, 
---
I was just showing everyone that Todd  needs to fix his game
---
I went to go pop a balloon last night, but it turned out to be a tick  
---
If you nuke whitesprings and farm the golf club over and over by rejoining on a friend or alt account, sometimes it breaks the spawns in the golf club and weird things will spawn. I've had liberators, high level robots, and lvl 1 eyebots. Yes, they drop level 1-5 legendaries. Unfortunately I couldn't get any 2-3 star eyebots, just singles, and they only dropped one star stuff. Still pretty nifty though. I used my level 1 bloodied basebat with a rocket mod to great effect while leveling my recent alt.
---
ooh I got the civil war body spawn that was awesome, he had plans for the civil war outfit on him that I can sell for 25 caps each, costs 3 cloth and 1 gold to make.
---
When only one person gets it legit you know it's working as intended. 
---
It's to give the players a sense of Pride and Accomplishment that they know only 1 person can possibly acquire all of the masks. 
---
Just go back to the same spot and try to move it a bit further from any main structures. It might be okay after that. I got kicked from the cat lady house, then I moved it a bit further away and it's fine.
---
The command area vendor terminal has this.  You must make the rank of General to get access to the area first.
---
If that were true then whomever we saw with the rare mask, the entire team helping in that parade should have had them too right? But as of now there was one confirmed spotting of a mas. 
---
So I checked w/ nukes n dragons: Max Hydrofix and Munchy Resistance will eliminate all additional food and drink negs when useing chems, Max chem fiend doubles chem length, Max Chem resistance means you can’t get new addictions, and professional drinker means you won’t get addicted to alcohol.  There are a few perks in charisma that effect alcohol.
---
The perk we don’t have should be something like:  
---
addictions are now permanent but withdrawal effects are mitigated for X amount of time when you take a chem you are addicted to.
---
This would allow us to maintain addictions in an immersive “Junky” way and allow us to stack the “timers” of all addiction withdrawal mitigations.
---
ive been on so few serves on xbox where the sloth doesnt totally glitch just because of the pileup
---
I'm only getting player targeting when there are no enemies. Works well otherwise.
---
Will do, couldnt hurt to try
---
Hey now! Those vendorbots have baby eyebots at home to feed! Typical. A big box competitor comes in and puts all the mom and popbot shops out of business. 
---
IT gives me a waypoint thats out of the map, this game sometimes ffs. Repaired poseidon for shit
---
There are a couple proofs. Goblin and old man winter (x2) we're spotted, and one player shared the sun mask they earned on twitter. 
---
You are correct about value though. These things are stupid rare. These people have allegedly gotten offers up to $50 usd
---
Oh! I usually get a mask and a camp plan every time no robots were destroyed and only recipes when robots were destroyed. Might’ve been coincidental! Still looking to trade for the recipe if anybody is interested but thank you for the info(: 
---
I think it has to be melee. As in sneak up, still in hidden, and hit something. With a projectile would be too easy. I had this one with bourbon a couple days ago and had to use a stealth boy to complete the requirement. 
---
The one up the stairs in military wing right?
---
I have the problem all the time if the player is closer to me than the enemy is.
---
pretty please
---
This is great stuff. Pretty sure I've seen you in game too.
---
I keep hearing this but I'm not seeing it at all in my runs. The enemies don't spawn until the last bot gets to its place. I had the beekeeper get hung up by the church and we didn't realize it but couldn't figure out why the radtoads weren't spawning. Finally he got all the way down and the spawns started as soon as he got to his place and stopped walking.
---
What a useless thing to say. Sheesh
---
Oh my gosh, "gift bags?" That's great.
---
I think it can yes, if it's being contested.
---
The risk of being ass fucked while your trading nearby yeah, theyre releasing survival mode who love a bit of buggery but I'd rather not
---
Thanks 
---
There are three proofs across a couple posts on the front page. One came directly from the person who won the sun mask, and they've posted multiple photos.
---
I’ve been having this issue a lot and it’s really cut down on the time I play. If the servers weren’t so unstable I would definitely be playing a lot more. 
---
But people HAVE said they seen masks personally. In this tread. 
---
I’m not being pedantic. 
---
You are because you refuse any evidence someone else presents. 
---
In the words of the dude, that's just like, your opinion.
---
I noticed when this happens, if someone shoots the glitched sloth until he falls to pieces you can loot him!
---
Lol I spent stupid amounts of time in FO4 trying to lit cigarettes into ashtrays juuuuust right 
---
data miners have determined that this is a maths glitch
---
I'm not a pessimistic person, I promise, and anyone that has got them from a drop I wish them the best, but those screen shots are dodgy taken by other players and there was the dev room scandal, as major proof I'm going to screenshot the drop from when the quest ends and the loot is being dished out. 
---
If i work on some big project and someone want 30min work from me, when i am in middle of my job, it may cause i make error in it later, because i get out of context for while.
---
But yeah typical human can work on 6 things same time.
---
Yeah, I’m not mad. This stuff happens when you play online. Just trying to figure out the part that seems off.
---
I got the Responders bot, and the longcoat. It only took 50 or 100 tries. That's reasonable, right?
---
My problem is that this event is a demonstration on why we need scaling for events.  The only reward I have a bone to pick with is the Fasnacht donut for the stupid amount of ingredients you need to make it, and how little it offers in return. And not spoiling hardly even counts as a benefit with how little it heals and sates hunger.
---
Anyway, while everybody can do events, I am not a fan of the free-for-all nature of an event like this where one person can trivialize the whole thing with their overpowered legendary weapon and just wipe out all the enemies as soon as they spawn.
---
Some people might be satisfied by "player interaction" just meaning   you're around somebody talking into their mic, but that doesn't satisfy me. I come to events to do things, and when everything the  event spawns can be obliterated by one player and require me to just walk around in a circle bored for 4 minutes, that's not really an enjoyable experience.
---
Bethesda needs to consider very large groups in future events, or they're all going to end up like this when nearly everybody on the server jumps to the newest event, and there will be so much dead air when everything you fight is killed almost immediately.
---
If you know all these, why you keep saying hoarders have nothing to do with server instability? they impact servers even more than those dupers, since none of their items stack now 
---
And those masks were featured on the marketing materials sent via email.
---
Not yet at least. Still gotta make my melee character.
---
I found a mask in the asylum a few weeks ago, but it is a Fasnacht mask I am pretty sure. 
---
&gt;majority reused assets
---
This isn't a bad thing. Just because a company makes a new game doesn't mean that every single resource has to be remade. 
---
&gt;costs 60 dollars
---
As do most other AAA games nowadays. This is more of a comparison of whether the content is balanced with the cost, which can be debated based on everyone's personal opinion.
---
&gt;had legendary poor stability
---
I'll give you part of this. The game did have notable server issues, especially when in nuke zones, but it's far from "legendary".
---
&gt;has basic skins at 16+ dollars
---
This is true to an extent, but very disingenuously posed. The main issue is that the dollar to atom ratio is a bit too high; reduce it a bit and you'll have more people outside of whales buying atoms. Regardless, players are still able to earn a fair amount of atoms by doing daily/weekly/character challenges.
---
&gt;has a cash shop that has at times sold temporary HP increasing items along with the cosmetics.
---
I've been playing since beta, and this has NEVER been the case. 76 has never sold anything other than cosmetics in the atom store. Even the CAMP object skins (Purifiers, Crafting Stations, etc.) require you to have the schematic learned and buildable before it will even let you use the skinned object; you can't use the atom store to shortcut into things you don't have learned yet.
---
It's more about the lack of risk because you can just do all of your farming on adventure, fast travel to where you want to be on survival, and relog to survival. You can drop off your valuable aid  items to an mule or friend, as well as your caps. Got a bounty after killing someone? Have a friend kill you. Free money.
---
VATS really should only target players if you have pacifist turned off imo.
---
Yup, pass where you learn about how to launch the nukes.
---
Ok lol, good luck with that
---
Yeah, though not as long as WoW.  Truly, people seem to not understand rarity in an online game.  They're still under the impression they're playing F4 where everything is guaranteed.
---
Just as a way to show you the cool stuff that you'll never get.  I imagine the person that built those models is sad right now.  
---
That's too bad you feel that way. 
---
I agree. Somehow it's not doing that though.
---
Someone told me akin to a two shot’s accuracy (penalty). And if you ADS instead of hip fire all the time it won’t affect you at all really. 
---
is this comment inclusive of vats or just shooting? 
---
Interesting.  I can say that this happened to me twice. Both times, the guy kept the bots at the bridge, after the rad toads, for the rest of the event.  The mutants, sloth, and wolves all still spawned and the event completed with them still stuck on the bridge.  I haven't seen anyone successfully block the robots prior to the toads.  
---
I would argue that most know they are putting a delay button on it. There is more too it though, getting gear reliably is going to be more difficult in survival mode. You will never see the number of well geared toons in survival with a reset than you will in adventure mode because of it.
---
They will totally exist, but they will be more rare.
---
What about maxing everyone at lvl 50 to start and allowing for respec of their current perks?    
---
Only caveat would be if you haven’t reached lvl 50 then you play “as is”
---
Exactly how everyone should do it, get a tag on it and let others get their hits in too.
---
If they allow for players to bring in adventure characters and unlimited migration back and forth I won't bother. I was pumped for this - It was the game mode I was hoping for from the start.  With unlimited migration between servers then what's the point? It's not new or refreshing.
---
I asked in the other thread. You can't, as Watoga is a no build bubble
---
Plans/recipes drop everytime if you complete the event (not all the robots die)
---
Masks have a lower chance to drop the more robots die so it's not guaranteed.
---
Plans/recipes/beret are all in the same pool so they have an equal chance to drop which means it's harder to get a specific one.
---
I can see why you'd get value out of that.  For me though, that would be awesome immersion breaking and hurt the experience.
---
Trying to get shocks x2 and emergency protocols
---
There isn't a "wrong way" to play, IMHO. 
---
 I've got about 180 hours in and just made L44.  
---
But I take my time, dont fast travel (carrying too much junk), fully exploring everything, appreciating the graphics...and the visual gags, homages to various IRL movies, books, and events...
---
I'm kinda following the main questline, but not really....
---
OP, if you follow the overseer quest, it'll take you though level appropriate areas and enemies, leveling will come with that progression.  You'll get the backstory and learn why you are there.  
---
If you haven't done FO before, you'll also get some backstory.
---
Stay in the green area of the map for a while. Once you get to about L20, go to toxic valley.
---
You'll be able to do some stuff along the divide (center of the map mountain range). 
---
Go to far east or south @ low level and you'll die a lot.
---
I hopped on from not playing for a month to grab some bounties and then slink away. Only fun part about the event.
---
it's mathematically impossible to get the rare masks, they screwed up the maths in the code
---
It doesn't matter who took the survey or why, as it's not an opinion, so there's nothing to bias the data.  It's just 1000 people who rolled a particular set of metaphoric dice, and theres no reason to expect that because they a) care to report, or b) all reported on the same site that it would impact that data.    
---
As for the rare proof, I don't know how many people claimed to have gotten a mask, or how many of those people showed proof or were removed from the tally, but unless it was like 100 people, I don't see how it would greatly effect the outcome.    
---
I think the results are probably within the margin of error.  
---
just refer to them by username with u/, as in u/RocheClip81 . Creates a notification for them that they've been mentioned in a thread. I call it "tagspamming", because if it's abused they're going to start ignoring them, but if you want to do it, go ahead. 
---
I posted pics yesterday. He joined one of mine and ran the whole parade with the other bots.
---
\~the horror, oh gods the horror\~
---
But you're not offering any evidence dude. You're expecting people to take your word for it. That's not what evidence is. Like, dictionary direct, that's not what evidence is.
---
"I am the inventor of the internet so what I say goes."
---
I said it. In this thread. If you choose not to believe me, you're just shunning my evidence.
---
Sounds fucking dumb, right?
---
lol
---
Not necessarily. I said that I think the chance may increase. Even then it is probably a rare chance rather than impossible and is determined at the he individual level.
---
I have not been able to try the theory out though because it is extremely difficult to organize strangers on a random server to help figure things out.
---
*insert thank you gif
---
I think that's a great way to go about it, honestly.  I know I've got an unpopular opinion here, but I like that there's something that even dedicated grinding can't guarantee.  
---
&gt;How is this game still unplayable
---
It's not.
---
This is the sole reason i had to stop playing.  I’m going to try the game out again when they add the legendary vendor, but if this and the melee stop swinging bug arent fixed by then it was all for not. 
---
600+ levels across my characters. But to have stuff like this START happening when they add content or make fixes really makes me pessimistic about the potential for such spaghetti code
---
Hell I bet. Going at it ATM and just shit drops 
---
I agree there needs to be something.
---
Like negative mutation side effects have class freak to make them better.
---
I hope junkies get some love in a future patch. Seems like a fun way to play the game but sadly it just don't seem viable as an alternative yet....the additional damage output seem men compared to other weapons of its class.
---
side note same thing with nocturnal. I understand the buff at night but the negative durring the day with no perks to negate or minimize during the day make the modifier,  useless. Maybe if they had some sort of perk to normalize day time damage,  or got ride of the daytime negative effects all together, might make that class of weapons something to try as well.
---
nstoppable costumes, +15 temporary HP. 
---
You can say "well that isn't a big deal, 15 HP isn't much and it went away after a week!" but like, the cosmetic only thing already turned to "well, mostly cosmetic" two months after launch. And all the loot box stuff is still in the code. Even if it's not launched yet. 
---
Did anyone on your team hit them or own a workshop? Were you in or near a versus area?
---
It’s nice playing other roles from time to time. Helps give you something to do lol. As a melee main, I find it fun sneak criting unsuspecting enemies from safety occasionally. 
---
Welcome to the dark side!
---
I'll have you know I built my business from the ground up.  I literally placed it piece by piece.  And then when it wouldn't allow me to move it due the severe CAMP bugs I rebuilt it time and time again in each different location.  If those vendorbots want to compete they will have to collect junk just like the rest of us!
---
It's like the pve crowd wanted a separate server ( which I think is dumb ), they got that.  Now they want to dictate what happens there, when they will probably never step foot on them.
---
Until they completely wipe out any duped weapons or armor it will never be an equal playing field. 
---
That’s where they should start.  You can keep your character build and allow for a perk respec but get rid of the dupes for once and for all.  
---
Ok, what are the things doing the flinging called and where are the plans? 
---
I got the dreaded "controls disabled" and disconnected twice last Wednesday but then played fine for over three hours. Then again this morning I was disconnected, but once reconnected played fine for over an hour. I have 100Mbps internet and play on PC ( not wireless ). So I think that there are still some issues with stability, but it is vastly improved from where it was.
---
I didn't make my point clear enough, sorry.  
---
What I was driving at is that people who answer that survey are more likely to have not gotten rare masks and came to Reddit to gripe about it, and the burden of proof is such that even someone who actually got one may have been discarded as a liar/troll because they didn't care enough to provide "proof"
---
Right i agree aq isn't this event. This is def more like a wow holiday event. Hell ill even say that aside from the first few runs its charm wears off. But rare items are pretty much in every game ever these days. From TF2,LoL,dota,Counterstrike,wow,runescape,the list goes  on and on.
---
You can do this 20 minute event as many times as you want for a decent amount of masks, patterns and recipes. So your walking away with plenty.  Personally i love the idea that only a few people will be able to boast a particular item. This of course causes a case of the have and have not's. 
---
How do you post a ticket?
---
I have run the parade about 30 times. I've lost a bot twice so far. I've paid careful attention to their health bars. While I havent seen all of them at 100%, one time only one bot had a sliver of health taken out. Same drops as when all 5 had half health. 
---
\*sniff\* you keep holding that body as long as you need to... \*sob\*
---
No you don't, that's the point.
---
  IIRC an earlier discussion, I think anectotal evidence says patch 7 introduced about a 20 hour IRL since last visit timer for respawing (at least) things like PA and cores...and it seems to carry across servers.
---
Lvl 150+ and I don’t even shoot the sloth anymore. I’v dropped tons of double owl, toothy, soldier, and double plans I’ve gotten so far. Just want the skeleton mask if it exist. This is about having the server come together to celebrate a hourly event that it easy on the low levels while giving higher level players like myself a chance at a rare mask drop. Consider the mask drops like it is a god roll piece of armor or weapon. It’s rare for a reason. 
---
Those who say they have no one to play with during their adventure in Appalachia haven’t given it chance to meet and greet with your fellow Fasnacht  paraders. Made a lot of friends just taking pictures with players and chatting while waiting for the hourly event reset to happen. 
---
Overall it is a great event and I am happily enjoying myself. 
---
Why are you being so anal-retentive about a person saying that their game is buggy? You can literally read posts on this sub every day of people still experiencing bugs/glitches/crashes etc. 
---
Just because YOU don't personally see them doesn't mean it's your job to keyboard warrior against everyone else that says they do. Does Bethesda pay your bills, or something?
---
How long will you be on today? In need of a few serums.
---
6 things at once? Where the hell did you get that number?
---
Yes 
---
2 stubborn entitled jackasses who both believe they are rightious in their behavior. (Im one of them)
---
Just thought it was a story worth sharing. Happens alot, dont see alot of posts from the raiders pov.
---
The only mask that’s rare for me is the giant. Maybe got like 5 of him when I have like 10 of all others 
---
Do the whitesprings run over and over again. Even at level 200 it's the best way to level. Even better when it's a nuke zone. 
---
it never has for anything else than lead and aluminum
---
I agree with most of this, other than the implication that people digging and analysing  are not also enacting a form of fun.
---
A while yet. Just let me know what you need. 
---
yea, expect this time, its gonna take around 3000 tries and limited for a week.
---
I bulked 300 aluminium and saved 10 pounds so yes it works well
---
In the latest Inside the Vault they made it seem that all other aspects of survival will be the same as adventure. That was after they explained the XP boost and PvP rules etc. So, I am assuming C.A.M.P.s will be unchanged. However, keep in mind this is a BETA so it is subject to change. If you want to know for certain you may just have to wait until the 26th.
---
Yeah that would be awesome. Now if they would fix the lag and freezing  
---
I find it annoying spending 20 caps going to a location and because some one else looted the location I have no idea when the loot re-spawns. If we take lead for example we know there is 4 lead spawns / silo's / fire department. It's unhealthy that players do not know when they can go back to these locations and them not being able to know when it respawns is kinda crap.   
---
If you take Old School Runescape usually everything is timer based and the timers are usually public.
---
When I found my first Deathclaw tameable it was pre-scorched. Also, have not found once since.
---
Tip: Indicate your platform so others might know if they can assist
---
\- Do any events you find
---
\- Hit the power plants and do the startup quests
---
\- Usually tons of monsters outside of Whitespring
---
\- Invite others to a team (or ask to join). Easier to kill things when grouped.
---
I didn't say that. i said those doing so, aren't able to verify what they are saying. 
---
I'm level 152, and found going through Harper's Ferry gave me a level almost every time at your level. I have to do it 5 times to get a level now. Try that, and possibly find a friend above your level to make level 64 enemies spawn for more experience, just tag the enemies and let them kill.

Manually swap Lone Wanderer for Hard Bargain in my Sneaky Boi loadout when I go on vendor runs. Before Perk Loadout Manager went to 12, I did a manual swap from sneaky boi to wild kingdom as well.
---
Dude you can make 1400 caps a day from vendors and there are constant posts of mutations being sold for 100 caps each... 
---
Really not trying to be flippant but, kill  stuff, craft stuff, cook stuff, find new places, challenges, etc.?
---
If all else fails, pummel stuff at whitesprings until dead? Hell, I went to whitesprings just to get that damned sword and kept dying against a high level ghoul, but I just came back and back until it was dead.
---
Very much this. I'm not sure why anyone thinks it's a good idea to make it possible to screw yourself over in such a spectacular manner.
---
Yesterday some Level 200+ one shot (i think) the sloth with a power fist before anyone else could get a shot in. Everyone was doing the thumbs down emote and was obviously annoyed with him.
---
&gt; But you're not offering any evidence dude.
---
I never said I had evidence. I've been saying that we DON'T have any evidence to back up peoples claims. All we can work off is what Bethesda tells us. 
---
People have said they aren't in game, and that it's a lie. The devs have said otherwise. You either believe them or don't. 
---
That’s cool. I like bein melee for the sneak deaths I can get on enimeies with the sneak perk and the  escape artist. Plus if u put Ninja on as well ur killin everything before they even kno ur behind them. I heard it works on SBQ as well but I’ve never seen someone do it, but a guy on here.  
---
Thanks I will give melee a shot. I was using a rifle for the sneak attack
---
I multiple the weight of one piece of scrap by the amount of scrap in the bulk. Then compare the weights, if the number you calulate is higher then the weight of the bulked version then it is worth bulking.
---
One thing I’d recommend is waiting around a bit after the event to see if anyone will drop off some things. Somebody dropped a bunch of their duplicates and I got like 5 masks, 3 plans, the donut recipe and a beret.
---
My mistake I re-read your comment I goofed. Sorry about my complete lack of reading comprehension there.
---
And this is how the great duped vote controversy began
---
The beret is supposedly hard to get too. 
---
I hunt down wanted players and always say "it's for your own good" before plasma minigunning them to death. I then walk away so they can take their junk back
---
10/10
---
Amen, brother!
---
I was very pleased with the beret, because there's not many hats ingame that look good on my character. 
---
And according to studies, not enough people are wearing hats these days. 
---
Yeah, it's so obvious this should be a thing that I forgot this wasn't already a thing.
---
wish the max picture limit was &gt; 50, and/or there was a way to xfer pictures from the game to the console hard drive.  
---
I've had to go back and delete multiple times.....
---
Yeah dude, everyone who hates on this game is just regurgitating clickbait reports, there's no WAY that this game was a buggy unfinished mess at launch that could've influenced opinions in that way. You show those youngsters, old-timer.
---
/s
---
Probably is different for lead etc.. and I am only theory crafting.
---
Typical expression of a caste system.
---
I was in that parade too! I've never seen so many random players in one place, which was cool. But it also seemed like a ton of high levels being annoying like the fat man player.  
---
I think it would minimally (because of the plastic usage) but never worth doing.
---
I tend to bulk just because it makes everything look more organized, but I never paid enough attention to the weight difference occuring. 
---
And I need space badly at this point.
---
How about smelting? Does that change weight?
---
All I ask is that just put one shot into the end boss and let everyone get in a shot.  No need to kill him instantly, let the low level players (not me) get a shot in to get the reward as well.
---
I wasn’t on a team, and we were near a workshop but they weren’t contesting the workshop. Several of us were outside the team that did own the workshop, and respawns put me well outside the workshop area, near a landmark well north. Was killed coming back into camp well before entering the typical PvP zone.
---
"You are because you're refusing any evidence anyone presents."
---
This conversation has gotten too full of shit even for me. Far thee well, white knight
---
Yep done the event like 50+ only got 1 beret and that was on my first day! Which was as soon as event went live!
---
I think a lot of people would be into that.
---
Okay! Will try next time :)
---
Ill be on around 6 so ill just add you and wait
---
Now I have something to hope for :)
---
In build mode look at the door or item you want to lock. On PC the key is F to lock, then you choose the lock level.
---
the hell are you talking about?  I haven't seen that since like Dec, this sub has been mostly positive for the past couple months.  I mean the game does still have issues but anyone pointing out those issues isn't bashing the game.  it's ok to like a game *despite* it's issues.  what's not ok is pretending the game doesn't have any issues at all, and I see way more of that than bashing.
---
Well I mean you could just not use the card, it's a perk card.
---
&gt;I’m running on 8 hours of sleep
---
Sooo the healthy amount? 
---
No the picture of the guy trading it says its worth 10 caps. If you sold it to a vendor it would be worth like 4 caps. Fallout economy. 
---
&gt;  Just stop, i got my job because i know how to do it. Those lovely developers must have same feelings. 
---
I mean I agree with the sentiment, but I also think if they should themselves as competent devs in the first place you wouldn't encounter as many of these situations. There are design decisions in this game that absolutely baffle me, and as someone who is not a professional in this field, even I could come up with a better solution. Things like weapon balance patches, how stats stack and interact, in game economy. There are so many games to learn from and its as if they said fuck that, we are going in head first and will learn as we go. 
---
The twist is that you turn into one
---
That's actually really true, I think I read too fast on that point.  I'd be on board with that perk.
---
&gt;Performance says no.
---
Depends on your rig.
---
&gt;It would be trivial to make lights cast shadows 
---
Not all lights have to cast shadows dynamically. In an interior environment with static fixtures, you can bake the shadows to improve performance. While not perfect, it's better than just having a directional or point light wash over everything, which is common in the game, and it looks terrible. Let's not forget that isolated interior environments run faster anyway, because the entire world isn't rendered in the background, giving more headroom for better lighting effects.
---
Pipboy shadowcasting wouldn't affect performance at all if the only light casting shadows was your own, meaning other player's Pipboys wouldn't do the same. It's the same method used in Left 4 Dead, a game that's 10 years old.
---
Why even say something like this. Out of 3 systems..1000s of players....what happened to the big sale they gave us...Run the parade as many times as u want and trade with fellow players. You can’t even trade with ppl.
---
i agree, the shots coming from sightings were questionable. i did not believe them myself at the time. the one that made me start to change my mind was the sun mask guy. granted, this could still be a dev room copy and i don't blame you for your skepticism. i really don't know what to think at this point. I've done about 30 runs, and others have done double that. it doesn't make sense to me that millions of runs of this event has been done and we can barely scrape together some screen shots. even after seeing the "proofs" im starting to feel like im completely wasting my time.
---
i think it's necessary to demand a screenshot of the mask drop, but is it realistic? a ton of people have no clue that this is even a scandal. Sun guy allegedly didn't realize the mask was worth anything until he got bombarded on social media after he posted the pic. then again, there are people out there more dedicated than you or I, and i think it is statistically impossible for not one of them to be able to get that screenshot after days of grinding.
---
i think Bethesda needs to come forward and be transparent on these drops. if there is something special we need to do, we should know that. if im spending 20+ hours running these events with only a .001 % chance, we should know that too. 
---
people keep trying to allege the rate is around .03%, which is the rate for certain other (non limited) rare items in the game, but i don't think the evidence presented thus far reflects that. 4 reports out of literally millions of runs is definitely lower than .03% these are also the only reports across the entirety of reddit, twitter, and facebook. it really isn't adding up and it's bullshit that we do not know for a fact if we are wasting our time or not.
---
And remember that actually there is a bug, dunno is already fixed, that prevent you to place the camp when you log again even if you build it after the patch.
---
The problem is in the C.A.M.P. device itself, if you move it after you finished building (as i often do and i think everyone do too) you can put it in any place of your camp zone, but when you log again, if the radius from the new position is in a place that prevetn building of new camp, the server mark it as not placeable even if it's not the case.
---
For example mine was near the map border in south east (when it says that you can go further), i placed the device with the green circle near the border and builded the camp, after that i moved the device in a room near the border so when i logged again it said the my camp is in a no build zone, so it didn't consider the real place of the camp but the radius with the actual place of the device as center.
---
Hope they will solve this and hope you understand what i wrote since english is not my native language...
---
I agree. 
---
Your attempts to defend these shit drop rates are getting more and more pathetic. They are way to low. Until I see a video of someone completing the event and getting a rare mask I won’t believe 
---
Understand your point, but wearing PA, the viel, bandanas, gas masks, to full head masks, I don't see players full faces (ergo, expressions) very often.
---
Enjoy the abundance! 
---
See, I've done that.. But have also read about how perk cards regarding weight don't apply to stash box. So the weight shown might not be the same when it's in the stash.
---
I might just take all my perks off and do the math that way 
---
It is an unfortunately common thing now, this outrage. The thing is, it does come from something - Bethesda did fuck up with the launch of the game, it was a buggy mess, the beta exposed a lot of issues that weren't addressed at launch, which added fuel to the fire, warranted or not. Players I felt did over-react, but bethesda came across as tone-deaf by releasing the buggy mess, charging full price for it, dropping the price soon after, all the while being quiet about everything. Don't forget the canvas bad, lol. From a PR perspective, it was a disaster, and for the gaming community at large, who really don't care about the game, the bad PR is all they know about the game.
---
I'd just be happy to view the character's name instead of just their account name
---
Power Armor fall immunity time
---
or you could turn off the quests you aren't doing like a normal person, when I see screenshots and the player has like 50 active quests I get anxiety, just turn them off...  I personally like the monochromatic hud and do not want that to change.
---
I won't stop until the Atom Shop fulfills my request of lingerie, and clean funky underwear for my Appalachian Strip Club!
---
I love this game, the quests and events are fun, but for me the role-playing is my favorite part!
---
Same and I felt excited when I keep getting it, if the other masks are just rarer than that, that would be fun. 
---
First, a HUGE thanks for this list. I had made my own checklist off of various sources but was still having trouble weeding out some Atomic shop and just plain misnamed items from it. It appears I have 221 of the 245 available outfit items.  
---
Second, do you have any clues where you get the Cappy Jacket &amp; Jeans? Every place I look online for help either brings up info about the Bottle and Cappy outfits or about Fallout 4 outfits. I'm just guessing it is a Responder Vendor Bot item that I haven't seen yet?
---
First time I joined someone threw an orbital strike down on the effigy after we'd lit it, that was awesome
---
Sent you a friend invite last night when I originally saw the post. I need to double check on my materials, but I'm interested in getting ahold of the carnivore, herd mentality, and speed demon serums. I don't get off work for another few hours (4pm CST), but after that I'll be able to take a look at what I've got. If I don't have the flux required, but I have other fluxes, would I be able to give you those in place perhaps?
---
6senses!
---
Lmao ive gotten 4 owl masks in a row
---
no.  Fallout has always had a monochromatic hud, don't change that.
---
I’d totally agree, however with this being a limited time event, I see most people giving them a price hike after the event rather than trashing them and/or giving them away ): 
---
Good luck!
---
Between 2 nights now I'm on 11 between 3.
---
Ah, may bad, I get you now, that is a valid point.  Though, I would also expect if the rate was something noticeably better than sub 1% a good handful of reddit posters would have gotten them, and would have proof, and willingness to brag.  :P    
---
I personally have only seen one in game, and it was the same mask as the one you can see on the free player icon, with the frizzy hair and big nose.  Saw it this morning, and I never even heard talk of it.  Could it have come from somewhere else?   
---
Ps4?
---
Time-limited event without an ability to get every single item that this event has to offer is just a bad design. I dunno how anyone in their right mind can argue with that. Personally i'm glad it's just a bunch of ugly masks this time. If it were plans or skins i'd be very salty. However such situations in general shouldn't be a thing. End of story.
---
So what you are saying is you got something from it, just not what you were expecting.
---
It would be cool too if while sitting you can actually open your pipboy and have a drink. 
---
I saw this yesterday repeatedly on one server last night there was a level 26 that couldn't get close to the sloth because of level 100+ individuals killing it in two seconds. I proceeded on the following run to one shot the sloth before anyone had a chance and dropped the loot off to the level 26 that had been trying so hard to get a look in, he was thankful for it, the others... not so pleased.
---
I am level 107 and as soon as I did one run through the event and realised even my worst weapon was one shotting the majority of enemies I crafted a new pistol level 10 specifically for the event so that I can only tag enemies giving the lower levels chance to get there shots in.
---
 It's a shame about the higher levels all attacking the legendary before any lower levels have the chance, it's only a level 30 and the drops arnt the best for the high levels and is much more beneficial  for the lower levels to be able to loot the sloth.
---
you can also click on the marker on the map and select stop tracking
---
Ahh build mode
---
You might want to reaffirm that it is for caps rather then giving away.
---
Not a problem. Shoot me a message when you get on. 
---
I like the Goblin mask though. 
---
no, some other way sure, but don't change the monochromatic hud, all Fallout's have a monochromatic hud and that shouldn't change.
---
Its not a participation mask. If you want it that bad put in the work. Kudos to the devs to make people actually work for something when duping has spoiled everyone.
---
Grab the starched genes perk! It's worth it. Then it's easy to farm inside the Blackwater mine. Run into water with the barrels, take rads until you get it or die, respawn and use the decontamination chamber at the mine entrance, repeat.
---
Yeah, I frogot to mention that. Also remove any armor pieces that reduce junk weight. If I'm not mistaking, lead and aluminum are the only ones worth bulking.
---
I have zero self control during the parade, I probably pop more balloons than help out in the event. Unless... OOH SQUIRREL! 
---
What do you want for the 3* tesla? I would make an offer, but I have no idea what it goes for.
---
Isn’t 12 on the effects page? 
---
The reward they are looking for by nuking it still totally there 
---
I'm gonna start a new character because my current lvl 81 character is not built to fight at all.
---
Meh, it just dies without animation and solidifies and becomes unlootable most of the time anyways.
---
Btw, first time i ran the even (lvl 77) i got the beret too.  I have 4 of the masks, and i purchased the summer mask from the atom store (with earned atoms). I am enjoying this event.
---
Good point, thanks! 
---
Asking before I go out of my way to get it.
---
Oh that's crazy, I didn't even know that was a drop.
---
I'm inclined to think it's legit.
---
I know I saw someone wearing an Old Man Winter mask during a parade two days ago. People either call me aliar or say that they must have gotten it from the dev room though 🙄
---
Honestly me either, I don't use energy weapons. 1.5k? 
---
Stealth is my go to playstyle.  However, with this character my stealth is more like a megaphone. The type you use when you roll up to some mobs, and are all like...
---
"Attention.   Attention.   All you bloated, glowy ghouls and your little pet Deathclaw too.  You see this axe?  It's coming.  Coming for you.  Just lemme get my buzz going, then we can dance. LEEEEROY JENKINS!"
---
It's all about the subtleties. 
---
I can do that.
---
Agree 100%. We need _something_ to use glass on. It has very few uses in game. I was hoarding bottles for the brewing update but apparently we can make glass bottles from wood. Makes perfect sense.
---
Well put, well said. Your english is fine. 
---
Ok cool, GT BelgianBeerLuvr 
---
Yeah. It looks like it comes out pretty even for everything else.
---
I just have so much junk, I need to stop hoarding.
---
Like, does anyone ACTUALLY need 2400 cloth?
---
With that, I need to bulk it to sell it though, correct?
---
I think expectations to get just one of the masks is pretty reasonable for those grinding all week at least.  I’m mostly disappointed that the event doesn’t scale to higher levels, but I’m not sure the best solution there.
---
In the end the event is charming and was pretty fun for the first day.
---
UPDATE just got my second beret that’s crazy!
---
$11
---
What do you want for the Gatling gun?
---
We're all out of the same vault, we should be helping each other.
---
Bullshit they never did.
---
I had three guys come after me,  no workshops,  they just didn’t like that I was trying to farm in the same spot.
---
All three opening up on me dealing slap damage with high ROF two shot weapons made my bar drop pretty damn steadily.
---
I haven't really used them either, but I've done a rifle build, melee, and shotgun, so I thought I would give energy weapons a shot.
---
Literally just got another Beret! It’s crazy!
---
If you're following the marchers he'll spawn in the trees to your left, around the time they reach the final stopping point and the wolves attack. He's a level 35 legendary, so you won't get any max level loot, but it might be something you can gift to a lowbie, or if you get lucky it'll be a lightweight 3* item you can stash until the new vendor appears.
---
As much as I loved having a perfectly square house with way to many windows next to each other (/s) I would LOVE window plans.
---
I think that if someone is wanted, their whole team should be flagged as wanted. 
---
I recently read a saying that goes: "As we say in Germany, if there’s a Nazi at the table and 10 other people sitting there talking to him, you got a table with 11 Nazis."
---
Great name. I will be on in about 15 min. GT dydamas
---
"They need this to brag about, and use it to raise their self esteem."
---
You're being pretty self-righteous about this, aren't you?
---
You are making blanket statements about about people you don't even know. I know many players who are enjoying the event and would really like to get at least one rare Mask by putting in the effort... because that's what Bethesda used as the "selling point" to encourage people to participate.
---
Its at the end when your coming onto the main street, likely across the street to the right some.
---
No, you didn't. Implications are often not outright statements. That said I mean no ill will, I am merely drawing attention to the fact that people enjoy puzzles. In this case, possibly perceived puzzles.
---
I’m sorry, I see what you’re saying, but you’re just so very wrong my dude. Your two points (the event is inclusive, stop bitching about not having the masks) have no connection to each other at all, and every single complaint about the rare masks is totally valid because its frankly 100% pure grade A bullshit that they advertised items that are functionally impossible to acquire. 
---
1k? 
---
Best practices for limited time events is to ensure drop rates are reasonable for casual players.
---
of course it is about the masks.... that is the main appeal.
---
i appreciate your stance of appreciating the event for what it is, because i feel that way too. this is a super fun event and the event itself is a cool concept and should be taken lightly.
---
that being said, that absolutely does not undermine what's going on with these drops. that's great that *you* don't care about masks, but some of us are putting crazy hours into getting them and we cant even tell for certain if they are actually dropping. that's bullshit- plain and simple. pointing out flaws and issues isn't "throwing a temper tantrum" and just accepting that things will always be broken so we should just enjoy what we have is such a shitty stance, especially when Bethesda has been pushing for community feedback.
---
seriously it is ridiculous that every time some kind of scandal happens, there is some apologist crowing about how everything is roses and nothing is wrong. it's fucked up and it undermines those of us that have valid complaints and insights. quit acting holier-than-thou because you have different goals and priorities in the game.
---
I’d love glass walls lol super low durability but beautiful
---
There is a lot of the game left for you to experience. I don’t understand what you mean. You get exp for finding locations, crafting, building, killing, doing events, ect. 
---
Do literally anything. You must have a ton of the map left.
---
Same.  Only thing I keep locked in my camp is the door to the Fusion Reactor room.  Even that probably doesn't need to be locked, but I do it.  All my crops, water purifiers, bed, decon shower, and workbenches are freely available to anyone who wants to use them.
---
Yeah I have no proof that I did see the guy, but I did.  I was like... woah wtf is that?  hah.  At first I assumed it was a shop item because I had not heard anyone mention it, and no robots wear it, but I see no way to get it other than the event, and I saw them doing the event.  
---
I have really good defense, in terms of giving damage I'm not that great. I'm mostly the food and medic guy. I have a few sniper perks to stay back so I don't aggro enemies while my team is engaging. Im definitely a support guy
---
Nice! 
---
Happy to hear that and hope this will help
---
It is just basic science.
---
I've done it 2 or 3 times, and because I never know where the Sloth is going to spawn, it's down before I've ever had a chance to damage it.
---
I was picturing just different shades of the same hue, so it's pretty close.  
---
Ah, on PC, so not an issue..
---
You should start by sleeping first to get the extra 5% xp bonus then craft and eat cranberry cobbler for another 5% xp bonus then do whitesprings , west tek, events . 
---
We need a Mr. T haircut
---
I know your feels ... 3 giants in a row 2 soldiers and 3 owl and 1 toothy man.
---
Set a rolling time limit on it though.  Lika month.  You don't want to have to carry around a scar of destroying a CAMP with a nuke by accident.  Or if you have changed your ways, you shouldn't be shunned forever.  This is coming from someone that has never destroyed a CAMP item or killed another player.
---
Yeah
---
&gt;Might have to figure out where he spawns 
---
He almost always spawns in one of the 2 trees next to the parking lot that's across the street from the church. 
---
yes, yes we do. 
---
All i have is soldier owl and toothy
---
I meant just shooting in general, I dont use vats much.
---
Deal. Can you hold it for a few hours? 
---
Gt: boppo363
---
smelting reduces the weight a lot, each ore weighs like 0.1 or something and that piles up really fast. some materials only weigh 0.05 per piece so definitely smelt what you can
---
Which mods are you looking for?
---
People nuke it to be funny, and be dicks!
---
I have like 80% of this map done
---
Yeah, it is fallout, so there are raiders. It is beyond me how people don't expect this. I bet you even completed the Rose line of quests.
---
You got it, it's tucked away in my STASH until you get on. 
---
It should be cool now that energy weapons got a buff. 
---
Yeah the last one I saw didn't have an accessible corpse, it was just kinda frozen there.  I got the exp but no loot gump appeared on mouse over.
---
yes, your comment does indicate that, sorry, and parts of this hud are different hues, I do like that idea.  I actually like this hud the best, it's like NV but updated, I do like the different hues.  I even made my pip boy the amber from NV and it matches so nice, also the pip boy light is now amber, so that's a plus!
---
Heh, "the good stuff"
---
You're 100% right OP, and when it comes down to it? It's all a matter of some deluded, false sense of entitlement. Just because you have endured the hardships of the game (much like a lot of us have), or made the personal decision to grind the event until your eyes are burning and you can't stay awake any longer, does not make you entitled to just be given the rare item. It's like the lottery. Are you going to get angry at the lottery because you bought an immense number of tickets and got nothing? No. Because you know it's not guaranteed. A majority of the people behaving so poorly around this matter are even adults. Making the problem that much worse.
---
That said, all of the people taking it in stride? You guys rock. Fuck all that focus on the rare items. Just have fun and enjoy yourself.
---
Yeah, that's one of the reasons I want to check them out.
---
@39 with PA with a decent melee weapon, you should be able to to a WS run.  
---
Been playing since January - with 180 hr in game, I just made L44 a couple days ago - have not been to the bog or mire, but I have been doing WS runs w/ a L15 vampire machete for a while now.  
---
  Helps to be with a buddy in case you get overwhelmed (bloated ones tend to gang  up on you) but you'll get lots of XP when you kill them...annd usually, some decent gear.
---
Go back and follow the overseers quest - you'll get lots of backstory and discover why you are there.  Roaming through the towns, read the various notes, listen to the holos.  You'll eventually figure out why the ash heap is the ash heap.   The excavator quest will teach you why exavator armor even exists.
---
Oh...forgot...maybe it's obvious but, as a workaround you can check if the new position of the device is good using the "place camp" button and check if the new position is "green" so you may be sure that the server mark your camp as "good" when you relog next time.
---
Just make sure you press "cancel" after checking and not "place" lol, i always fear to do that and have to rebuild again...
---
The level in Fo76 only indicates amount of time played. Maybe by "skill"?
---
Matchmaking tends to suck for the higher end players too. The higher you go the longer the matchmaking takes. If it takes too long, they just get lumped into a lower bracket.
---
Always nice to see others enjoying the melee play style as well. If you're not already doing it, going into a low health, "bloodied" build with radicool is amazing, as you dish out massive amounts of damage while you tap dance on the line between life and death.
---
Also, as an addition to that fifth of whiskey and fury chaser we all love so much, don't forget to eat an occasional glowing meat steak for a well rounded meal, and an additional 10% melee damage, double that, if you have the carnivore mutation.
---
I've noticed this very recently, when I bought a TSE handy and made it my second option weapon, alongside my Troubleshooter's handy. Really annoying to have to fix that every time.
---
I honestly don’t know how you are such a low level. You must be not doing events and quickly skimming over everything. Are you fast travelling everywhere? That’s a waste of caps and a waste of a chance to get exp. 
---
Do events, defend workshops. Go to some super mutant strongholds and clear the areas. 
---
It started around 3pm est on 3-19, the event last for roughly 20 minutes, and restarts on the same server an hour after the previous one was started...so about a 40min wait in between. You can always play the "server shuffle" and hop around looking for an active event and join in.
---
I'd be happy if they would add Jet (from previous Fallout games). I realize they can't slow time, but they could at least give the character a very brief (i.e. 5 sec) speed boost to movement, attack/reload speed
---
Really? I was never sure of that and I have so much ore. Thanks for the tip!
---
...yeah, hit a stimpack, you wont die.
---
Adding that high level players camping at the sloth and staying AFK during the event is kind of cheesing the experience.
---
My last event let three robots die from the wolves to pummel the sloth.
---
Sloth should be more tanky and span after wolves.
---
I ran the event 20 times and didn’t even know the sloth spawned.
---
May try and find you later for the marsupial!
---
Please do!
---
Well, you were flagged somehow for sure. Itbmay be a mystery for ever.
---
No. The more times you complete the quest, the less likely you are rewarded with apparel/items. I think they've tweaked this tho. I had a long dry spell pre-patch 7. Now, I've since gotten the BOS Knight Paint, the engineer's outfit, &amp; Army Fatigues (nothing special but the principle is there).
---
I'm on xbox
---
Yes I am. But no more than you are. Happy?
---
Yep, it's been in the game since launch and is fairly common. 
---
THis has happened to me at Whitesprings. There were 2, and both ran away and hid behind cars, building, sprinted through the broken concrete fence behind the summer homes across from the firehouse. Very strange! I thought I was the only one this happened to. My friend who is a 189 level never has seen this and thought I was making it up. I think. 
---
Hey I do that too, I appreciate your candor.
---
It’s hard till 50, then it becomes a chore 
---
If these masks are dropping provide video proof of the completion of the event with the reward of a rare mask. Then I will buy into this mentality.
---
Sweet, hopping on now, IGN: ThatStencilGuy
---
Well most of those people got re banned at least a day ago so this wouldn’t effect the OP, I think it has to do with the massive amounts of people in one place but feel free to speculate 
---
I have an extra one
---
What platform are you on?
---
Are you seriously telling me that the client can directly trigger a cell change instead of activating an object and the server doing the cell change?
---
I keep a tesla rifle and a 10mm pistol around for these types of things.  Great for tagging enemies without doing much damage.
---
Join me. Fast travel to me. 
---
Just checked and you are indeed correct, many thanks!
---
Yeah, when you troll reddit threads for content, you can find any kind of opinion or fact that you want.
---
Lol. Seriously.
---
For example I am level 41 and haven’t even been to the cranberry bog at all. Or the top right are of the map either. 
---
That’s a good idea...as I posted at the end of my little synopsis, just comparing my J/E Combat Shotty to my old TSE Shotty it seems like the dmg is actually superior on J/E without the negative accuracy that comes w/ two shot.
---
This doesn't fall under the definition of impossible, just improbable, which is the nature of rare drops.
---
I was not aware that ass fucking was part of the game. Is there a toggle for that in settings somewhere?
---
What happens if the Chinese LP isn't destroyed? It just dematerializes (like the robots in Fasnacht)?
---
Seeing someone with one. Seeing one pop up for sale on the market. Otherwise these could be old screenshots from dev room items. It's just too clear that people want more proof. Someone with one would come out with video or try to sell it.  
---
Join me fast travel to me. 
---
You can get the rare mask when player vending is available.... Makes sense right?
---
Yup.
---
I'm personally excited to bring my main character into the new survival mode. He's well built for a fight, as I've wanted to use him for PvP since the game launched, but there unfortunately wasn't a lot of opportunity to do so in the current adventure mode, at least not without being a jerk.
---
I don't plan on going around killing lower level characters, where's the challenge in that? But I also don't have the time, or honestly the desire, to regrind through the whole game on another character. The main storyline of 76 was not that interesting, and I don't especially feel like playing through it all again.
---
I'm travelling with my PS4, playing with my cellphone 4G and have yet to be disconnected from the server. Maybe you're having problems with your internet?
---
And then some level 2 spawned him and walked right past it on a different server lol. It's all so random 
---
I was referencing the party hats from Runescape. Now worth several billions of runescape gold.
---
At event end and your screen is splashed with the rewards, saying what mask you got, and what plan you got.  A screen shot of that is more definitive proof of the masks being able to come from the event itself and not a dev room.
---
What you are referring to is called the P.I.G effect or Personal Instantaneous Gratification.   It is prevalent in society now.    
---
It is summed up with, "I want my rare mask and I want it now."  These are the people that want loot boxes also.  
---
If you're looking for another death claw, there's a guaranteed spawn point at the power substation just north of Watoga. There's usually a few ants that spawn as well, so hang back and let him take care of them before you run in and try to take him.
---
Maybe, but I’m going to reach out to Bethesda and try to figure it out.
---
i have 3 days with 4 hours sleep in total and i have done the event 100+ times and have like 80 common masks and 10 berets. That s simply a bad move
---
Hello fellow enclave general. Now if only I could launch a nuke. I have two key cards but no way to nuke anything.
---
10000% agree that survival and adventure mode should be separate. I have no idea why Bethesda is sticking to their guns on this one when it was very clear that the vocal majority didn't like this idea at all when it was announced... and also considering this just isn't really done in the industry. It completely compromises the tough survival experience they're trying to create. They might as well call it a battleground and be done with the whole original concept, because that's what they've created. 
---
That said, I don't really agree with the criticism of the leaderboards. I think bragging rights will be enough of an incentive-- and don't forget, a lot of people will actually get a kick out of being chased as the big dog. I don't think it needs to be incentivized with gear or anything like that.
---
Usually people are in parties so won't be in area chat. A group I run with is usually 4-6 of us, so to jump out in to area chat with 10 other people would be overwhelming. 
---
I call it being Veruca Salt but yes
---
Interesting I'll keep testing and let you know
---
Xo1 emergency protocols  and calibrated shocks
---
Indeed death has so few consequences that you can brute force things when needed. 
---
You're missing the point entirely dude. The masks, shouldn't matter. All the obsession with them, as OP stated, is ruining the event and making a good chunk of this Reddit take an ugly approach to the matter, all because of drop rates and what not. It's like waking up on Christmas morning and being upset you didn't get the gifts you wanted, like a spoiled child. It's not about the gifts.
---
Yes.  But the wild flowers nearby will be fine and perhaps even better than before.
---
I would not be surprised if it was more brutal in survival mode. They recently changed it so you had to fully destroy a camp object to become wanted. Perhaps they might change it back in survival to trigger wanted when damaging instead of destroying camp objects. who knows... We will find out soon.
---
It is not endless. I usually get three and then someone else has to come reset the spawn. It is a great way to farm xp if you need to power level. 
---
Well we'll whoosh that one cause it went right over me. Honestly, I barely know what that even is. 
---
I've been home with the flu for 3 days. It's the only reason I've been able to run it as much as I have.
---
I cant even get the witches mask. I'll give 200 plastic for one!
---
You seem to be missing the point. Nobody wants a participation mask, they just want a fair chance at the rare ones. What do you consider 'putting in the work' if 3 days of grinding/server hopping doesn't cover it? This far into the event there should be more than 4 or 5 drops over every platform. It's got nothing to do with effort, just bad statistics.
---
Yep, One Gun Army is the answer here. One guy once told me it doesn't stagger very much, even on level 3- but at 12% *per bullet* with the fire rate of a .50 Cal or a Gatling Laser- keep em staggered. I'm thinking 11 Luck is going to be necessary on my Heavy Weapon build now, for fully maxed Starched Genes, Class Freak, Bloody Mess, and One Gun Army. 
---
Thank you very much for this service and going the extra mile by posting the corresponding materials. 
---
There is hope for humanity! I'll be adding you next time I login.
---
&gt; Depends on your rig.
---
It would be a game wide change for everyone, so performance hits would effect everyone, and they have to keep things in line with the least common denominator, which is typically console hardware.
---
Nuclear Planetside 2
---
Imagine playing the game and still thinking they have any idea how to do their job in regards to PvP or balance.
---
Maybe. We'll see. It's still a bad design. I could understand if grand prize was some expensive stuff from Atomic Store like they do in ESO but a bunch of masks that you can't get any other way but from this event should drop often enough for your average player to be able to get them all in time. That's the basic design of time limited events for everyone.
---
Good to know. I run around with my Blade of Bastet so if I see it happen I'll hack the sucker into chunks. Thanks for the tip.
---
I heard that you have to put your best legendary item in a paper bag at the base of the statue in the church. Then you have to run to the other end of town and walk back. Then you are guaranteed a rare mask. Add me so I can verify you are putting the bag in the right place. 
---
That's not a bad idea, idk why there would be a problem with it 
---
I also keep everything unlocked and open.my vamp is ways up on the mountains and I rarely get visitors so if they make it there have at whatever u need
---
Its all good. Can't expect everyone to get references.
---
what is ``Puzzle Solver``?
---
I honestly haven't seen all that much outrage over it.  Disappointment, sure.  Calls to change it, sure, but very few people are foaming at the mouth about it honestly.  The only posts about it on the front page are all very civil.  
---
Thank you! 
---
As long as they hide Poll results..... I don't want to catch crabs... 
---
Only a few days left I think, better jump in.
---
I play on PC with a controller. It’s not really a handicap. We’re not playing a competitive tier FPS here, lol.
---
I simply find a controller more immersive for role playing games. Even in PVP in FO76 much is left to gear and strategy. 
---
That said. If two people were psychotically into PVP, and each made dedicated PVP builds with the best gear and weapons imaginable (and they were equal builds), and they were each equally comfortable with their input medium; then a keyboard+mouse user would probably have a very very slight advantage when aiming their crosshairs on a vertical plane. 
---
I don’t believe input method has much weight in a cross platform argument for RPGs. Certainly not ones with Bethesda flair (I also use a controller when playing ESO with no complaints).
---
Sure can!
---
It also makes it a lot harder to complete even if you don't have to do the butcher part. I was in a group and we had like 20 wolves spawn. We couldn't take them out fast enough and they destroyed all the bots in about 5 seconds. First time I've ever seen a failed event.
---
There’s a lot of misperception about the game. To many people are watching YouTube commenters who barely understand their own lives but have the nerve to make false accusations about Bethesda. For example, all the blue screens and server crashes. How many of them apologized for slandering Bethesda when it was the duping and exploiting groups that caused the server stability issue? How do I know this is a fact? 7 million stash weight characters were banned and their items deleted. All of a sudden, players that play the game how it was intended, can actually play. Gotta love you tubers. They seem to think that they are reporting the news but fail to actually report anything true. A good example is that dumbass Asian guy that sounds like the Asian woman reporter on family guy. Not one game play video but nothing but negativity being told.
---
Bethesda has their issues and they should own up to it. But those who messed up the game beyond playable status should man up. You can claim 900 hours of gameplay but when your account holds several items that were never released, it’s hard to prove your case. Some people will never be happy but those same people seem to want to stick to bashing a game vs. moving to another. Sounds like they are playing follow the leader for YouTube clicks. 
---
I...I'm going to regret this, but my MPH is making me bite on this. Do you have a link to this study?
---
I am 39 and am general of the US army and I am trying to get to level 40 at least so I can make the xo1 power armor and then drop the bombs. I have discovered watoga and done everything in the bog except successfully kill a scorchbeast
---
Other than ammo, and maybe another person, those key cards are all you need! Get out there and show Appalachia that the US government is still here and with absolute power we can protect them!
---
Preach brother PREACH!!!!!!!
---
Why do people flair up and declare that I'm trying to completely disregard their problems when I mention how it is odd that I don't experience it and wonder why they do?
---
&gt; You can literally read posts on this sub every day of people still experiencing bugs/glitches/crashes etc. 
---
What is causing those bugs, glitchs and crashes?  They generally have something that triggers them. What are players doing to trigger then that I am not doing? Literally the only thing I've not done yet on the game is launch a nuke and fight SBQ and that is just because I'm waiting for my wife who doesn't play it as much to catch up.    
---
How can my server experiences have no problems in South Florida yet someone in Central Florida can't seem to stay connected to the same game on the same console? Are the servers just better in Miami then in Tallahassee? How is my bottom of the barrel barely 4 mbps download and 400 kbps upload speed able to stay connected to the servers better then people with far better internet service speeds? How can 2 people play the game at the same time on that internet speed without a problem but 1 person with a high speed comcast 10 mbps download and 2 mbps upload can't seem to stay on the server consistently?
---
&gt; Just because YOU don't personally see them doesn't mean it's your job to  keyboard warrior against everyone else that says they do. Does Bethesda  pay your bills, or something? 
---
The snap back from people is far over the top for the issue and for the comment. It honestly comes across as if you are trying to hide something by reacting so strongly to a benign comment.   
---
I read what people say are happening. I repeat it  in game and the same issues do not happen to me. So what is the difference. What am I doing differently or set up my character differently for someone to have those issues? How can I do a uranium event and kill 3 or 4 legendary mole guys and get a legendary weapon with proper number of bonuses to the star rating on the mole miner. Yet others will do similar and they will not get a legendary at all?
---
What could I possibly be doing differently to never have experienced that problem? And more importantly what in the hell could other people be doing to trigger that bug/glitch that doesn't drop a legendary weapon when they kill a legendary mob?
---
I do wish we could pick the pip boy light.  Or get some mods at least.  I miss that from 4.  
---
I uh, respectfully disagree. xD
---
If people are being rude and doomsaying then that's one thing. But being critical and offering feedback before the mode launches is a GREAT thing. You're trying to throw out the baby with the bathwater here. Bethesda allowing free passage between these modes is a terrible idea that compromises the entire premise of a tough survival experience. They need to be aware of how much pushback exists against this concept because it could end up undermining the mode launch and turn it into another Hunters Hunted. 
---
I don't know about you, but I certainly don't want to see that happen. It's specifically \~because\~ the devs are putting so much time into this that they need pre-release feedback. It would be a real shame if Survival Mode ends up being another underplayed, largely ignored game feature that wasted the devs' time.
---
The gut reaction to being attacked by another player when you are minding your own business is to get angry. It's an emotional response that's part of what kept us alive in the ealry days of our existence in the wild. Something hurts you - you go hulk mode and destroy that thing. Supressing it and thinking rationally takes practice and experience. I've also noticed, not so much in 76, but in other pvp oriented survival games, that I have a severe fight / flight response to pvp where I could lose my entire gear set / inventory. It's to the point where I get a huge adrenaline rush, my heart pounds, I start to sweat a little, and my hands shake. The only thing that's given me a more severe reaction is when I was in my early teens, deer hunting with my dad. The first time I saw / shot / tracked and killed a deer by myself... oh man, the adrenaline. Nothing prepares you for that. It takes time and experience to master. I believe they refer to that as "buck fever". I can see why it's addictive, though for me, it was overwhelming. My legs felt like jelly, my hands shook so bad I had a hard time field dressing the deer. 
---
As for the cursing and stuff - I'm a systems admin IRL. I work in an office at a public library. I'm a pretty nice guy. I've also resorted to calling people names and saying things that I am not proud of in the heat of the moment. I think we don't really deal with situations IRL that cause such extreme anger, and when it bubbles to the surface through pvp in a video game, it brings out the absolute worst in us. I try to reign it in, but man sometimes it's hard. 
---
My apologies for assuming your gender. I should know better.
---
Been trying toake this happen but haven't been successful. The stingwings and wolves always get something in for me
---
I play often and never had the Scaly Skin mutation until 2 days ago. 
---
The first drop after patch 7 for me was the knight plans and then since then it’s been stimpaks and ammo. But that’s good to hear that you are still getting them. 
---
We need some deadlocks in the hair category. Even a decent afro. But yes I would throw all my atoms at character customization stuff
---
I make level 1 versions and leave them at the overseerers camp.
---
Sssshhh. Circumstantial evidence which reinforces your unfounded opinions is the best evidence
---
This is why I carry a Tesla rife. Not to much damage and can tag multiple targets at once.
---
That's where my events fail too. 
---
I don’t find it hard to find.
---
Man folks just require shit to be angry about with this fucking game. CALM DOWN YA DINKS
---
Yeah, I mean there has to be some differences.  As of right now camp turrets can't even kill mole rats lol
---
&gt;At level up time, I can't select new cards in S because it's already maxed
---
You can pick a card from any skill tree, regardless of whether the special stat is maxed. Go to the level up screen, put a point into an unmaxed special stat, and when the card selection screen comes up you can filter through the list (LB/RB on xbox) to see cards from different skill trees.
---
OP user names checks out
---
Haha what’s up again man that was no problem. I was the guy that spawned in and saw you soloing the event, couldn’t let a fellow vault dweller down, especially one in a Manta Man costume! And sorry I wasn’t trading and dropped the plans/recipe instead, trading with no mic can be rough so I figured dropping them would be better. But If you ever need any more of those recipes/hats add me! Psn Welcometothefunk
---
I wish we had more events where we all come together and fight one common goal. I actually was bummed when the event was over because everyone disappeared..
---
Pvp is good, i enjoyed it since beta. People playing this are only noobs in terms of rpg based pvp. No offence guys, you can't know how be best in everything.
---
Thats the event mask in monster mash in watoga, it used to be glitched out
---
Right right
---
Forgot that 
---
My alt is level 48 I can show u how I level..I'll be on most of the day tomorrow 
---
This is my one main argument with using my current character. I just got up to level 41 and access to the nukes. I don't have as much time to game as I used to. I don't plan on just shooting up other players. But if they attack me I'll fight back.
---
If you want to reduce weight in your stash, cell circuits, raw anticptic, silver scrap, fiberglass, raw asbestos for one for one on caps ( with no trade perks or grape mentats). Gold scrap sells for 2 CPS per one scrap. I find that these non bulkable junk items build up in my stash a lot.
---
Right on, I don’t have the most time either but I think there must be some things you are missing. Huntersville and West-Tek are filled with super mutans (and an interesting bit of lore). That’s my favourite place to go to just kill for some exp. they also are good for dropping caps. Other than that I’m going to guess that you haven’t done a lot of events or workshops. They usually contain high level monsters and you get exp at the end for completing them too.
---
Good luck out there brother.
---
It'd be beneficial to join the enclave instead because we definitely didn't put those giant mutant bats in the sky or anything /s
---
It's Nickelback Syndrome. 
---
It's a combination of low hanging fruit and people who love to jump on bandwagons. Hate against certain things can quickly jump to memedom because it's an easy thing to dislike -- be it games, movies, TV shows, or music. Once something becomes viewed as an easy target to hate by the majority everybody jumps on board with it.
---
Is Nickelback the worst band in history? No, but browse the web for long enough and you'll see massive hate directed their way.
---
Internet Explorer hasn't really existed as a web browser for years, and was outright replaced by Microsoft Edge four years ago... but you'll still see constant memes of how "Internet Explorer is only useful for installing other web browsers." But really, who's running IE in 2019? Certain things just become easy targets for hate and memes, and unfortunately Fallout 76 has become one of them.
---
The game has its issues, don't get me wrong. The entire launch was problematic, and the game should have been delayed for bug fixes and refinements, but... yeah.
---
People love bandwagons.
---
Thas nice, but imagine 1000ppl tell you something about your unfinished job and they don't know how this thing even work. 
---
I don't give a fuck about npc's but lots of people do care hence this post
---
Ah, that explains it!  
---
Yea, those are one of many random encounters. Also I don’t think you can redeem the certification based on my experiences.
---
Filthy Milk Drinker! Awesome builds!
---
Smart move - I will switch to my Tesla as well.
---
More like 25k caps to 5k caps
---
&gt;it’s probably for the best that Bethesda gets all this hate so they don’t release an unfinished game again
---
Yep. If 76 were released today it'd still be viewed as disappointing by Fallout enthusiasts but a good majority of bugs and issues with the game have been patched out. It's in a fairly decent state now, but Bethesda released it early and released it broken. There's zero excuse for the game to have shipped with as many major exploits as it had.
---
I was gonna try and do the event this weekend before it ended but it sounds like it's not even worth it.
---
When fighting THE Scorchbeast Queen in the Scorched Earth Event, the option to 'TAME' her appeared on Screen. Didn't attempt to try my luck though as the other players would probably get slightly annoyed if succeeded! :) Doubt it would work. A Shame though world domination was in my grasp...….
---
Sentinel armor, and with sentinel assassin its hard to take damage in pvp
---
This post and the comments are literally the first place I've learned that the sloth apparently spawns every time. I've only seen him once in 10 runs. :(
---
unfortunately I believe he’s talking about me, we basically duo’d the event because no one was around, and while waiting dropped some stuff for him, The parade is meant to bring us together! Gotta spread the love to fellow dwellers. 
---
Ik I was joking
---
The beret is rare?
---
&gt; But yeah typical human can work on 6 things same time.
---
&gt;6senses!
---
Uuh... no, humans are incapable of multitasking. We can track multiple things, but we can not actively do multiple things without fucking up. This has been proven many many times.
---
I dunno. I have two. Maybe uncommon 
---
I lost a lot of respect for EA/Bioware and Andromeda. The game had its issues but the fact they didn't stand by their product and abandoned it overnight was a massive let down to fans. Yeah, the product was mediocre, but the basically just shrugged off all the fans and walked away.
---
It is the middle of a workday 
---
On ps4 its always crowded
---
I remember getting that too. 
---
Are you selling one of it?
---
How much do people usually sell that for
---
A reference to the original Mitch Hedberg joke.
---
I personally found them at the Watoga Shopping Plaza.  I'm pretty sure they are there regularly.  You might have to server hop, but I think that is your best bet of all the vendors.  
---
Shit is boring as all hell. A 30 minute escort mission with the least challenging enemies possible. No clue how people can farm this.
---
What about the encryption?
---
But this is different. The masks should be possible to get. They simply are not. If they are unobtainable then why say they are? Why can’t we have a fun event with the rare rewards. Why can’t we have both? I’m not saying give it to me right away I’m saying I should be able to grind for it.
---
on PC you can edit the ini
---
was that a couple days ago by any chance?
---
Yeah paciFIST mode
---
&gt; I just hate that everybody can do everything. 
---
yes, I feel same way, but once they've decided to design the game this way, it is a crime to make us to waste so much time and humour with the perk swapping routines. 
---
One of those "oversights" because someone apparently wants this to be battle royale more than Fallout.
---
I see it go from anywhere from 18-25k but it has its counter just like everything, it’s not a one stop fix all for pvp 
---
Depends on what the sentinel is paired with, but each piece upwards of 5k, with unyielding sentinel costing 15-20k per piece
---
There was a low level that got sneak attacked by a supermutant suicider and no one would pick him up so I stimpaked him dropped some food and caught up with the March before they lit the fire. Some people are just asses.
---
I like your opinion.  I do however think you might have the wrong idea.  It's fine to have differences of opinion.  Obviously with any game or event there in whether it's limited or not, the intent is to have fun.  That's a given.  Why would a game developer create special events or game in general if the intent is not to have fun.  With that being said, the intent of this game is specifically to get loot.  Here's a quote from Valseek, a Bethesda Community manager posted 3 days ago:
---
" As mentioned in our recent [**Inside the Vault article**](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Pt0vzS8LLqzvSsNw3n98/inside-the-vault-fasnacht-seasonal-event-and-patch-7-preview), this is a limited-time event that takes place in the town of Helvetia and you can join in to earn fantastic (and rare!) Fasnacht masks, new C.A.M.P. plans, and other rewards. This event is also on a one-hour timer from the last time it was started in your current world, so even though it's only available for a week you should have lots of chances to take part in the parade and collect some loot.  "
---
Emphasis here is to do this event to earn fantastic masks, plans, and other rewards.  
---
Even just take a look at the roadmap they released.  They specifically state "complete this limited-time event to earn unique rewards."
---
So while I understand that this is a unique event in which people of all levels can participate in and have fun, which should be the general goal of the entire game, to demean those that are upset with the constant farming and lack of those drops is quite irrelevant.  They are entitled to those feelings.  While some may view that poll that was created as senseless, it clearly wasn't senseless to BGS as they have replied to that post stating: " The rare Fasnacht masks are attainable, they are just very rare. Thanks to your feedback, we’re looking into improvements we can make to the drop rate..."
---
Let's keep in mind that FO76 is an ever growing game.  A lot of these online only games grow based on community feedback.  Some will like changes and others won't.  The game devs might listen to a specific suggestion or they won't.  In the end, they will choose to do what they deem fair or necessary for the further growth of this game.  It is the community manger's job to listen to feedback from the community and be that liaison between consumers and developers delivering both the good and the bad.  I don't think you have the wrong idea about the event in regards to helping others but I also don't think those that are upset with the drop rates have the wrong idea either as this was an event specifically marketed at getting these "rare" drops.  
---
I am leaving a thumbs up for the heartfelt post though.  Your point was well stated.   
---
I don't think you really understand some of the complaints you address. :-p
---
Starting off with a level playing field is just that. It doesn't mean the game will be fair forever, that's obviously not how PVP servers work. But it's still an important first consideration. You seem to conveniently ignore the fact that starting off with a hugely imbalanced playing field is going to further compromise the mode's integrity, and will result in things like people being camped immediately, and people running back to the crib server to farm meds and items that will let them go to town on the PVP server. It's really a farce.
---
On top of windows, I'd really like some more wall plans in general.
---
I would pay real-world gold doubloons for many, varied wall plans.
---
And Roof plans, I need to throw money at a better roof.
---
Thanks, that's what I've been trying but will make a concerted effort tonight. So much fun server hopping for plans :p
---
Also there have been proven fact, some kind of people don't understand irony.
---
Thanks for being such a mensch. Wish more higher levels were like you. I will drag out my mike and ask people to please let everyone tag the sloth the next time I run this and hopefully people will cooperate.
---
I second shutters on brick and large glass walls/roofs.
---
Actually I would like more building materials in general. 
---
These comma splices hurt my bones ;_; 
---
That may happen during day as people are at work. On PC though I always see people turn up eventually, although the crowd is a bit thin when it's day in US/Europe.
---
Youre assuming every single fallout player is on reddit. That is insanely off base. There are people who have these masks. Youre either not on the right boards or like a few people I know are keeping their mouths shut to not be constantly harassed with trade requests. 
---
Nukacrypt.com updates weekly usually by Monday night with the new silo codes for the week. No need to manually guess them, unless you like the personal challenge of doing them yourself.
---
What makes it sentinel?
---
We need more Grahm's! :)
---
This is currently planned to be fixed in an update scheduled for early April. 
---
Ahhh, that would be good proof of you can get it.  That requires everyone to be really on the ball to get it though.  Makes the burden of proof pretty high
---
I don't want to get too into it but do you have proof that there have been real drops? You are right in your assessment that proving a negative (in this case that masks aren't dropping) is difficult. I believe the dev statements that they can drop. Honestly I do. But I think we are justified in wanting more proof. Presumably, the people on this sub are the most dedicated fans. For none of us  to have verified a mask drop (not just the presence of one, I've seen the pics) just seems strange to me. Circumstantial yes, but not baseless.
---
Its a legendary effect, -15% damage when standing still
---
The screen goes black and you wake up in a wagon facing a long haired blond man 
---
Yeah I hate it, too.  But it's far better than it used to be when there was only a slight chance a vendor may have a certain plan.  Good luck, man!
---
Just have it pull a Iron Gaint and fly off into the sky. Like a bugged Scorchbeast Queen but intended.

As long as it doesn't blow my ass up, I'm good with it.  I love mayhem and explosions 
---
Reduced damage by 15% while standing and not moving.
---
Enjoy the abundance.
---
That's all pretty fair.  Pretty high burden though. Can't imagine what I'd even want for trade if I got one though.... Sure wouldn't be caps.
---
Yesterday night, a random player just gave my girlfriend the dress off her back because my girlfriend liked it after the parade ended. The majority of people we've encountered in this game are good people. 
---
What are you going on about now? English please.
---
Oh ok ik it’s not a fix I just want something to help me in the new survival mode :)
---
I guess we're talking into deaf ears. I was hoping for a more productive discussion. 
---
It shows their inexperience with multiplayer games - trading, pvp, so many other games have done it, few have done it well, and bethesda doesn't have any of it. Launching without push-to-talk shows this exactly.
---
But it could also be they are handicapped by their engine. I see a lot of the ui limitations are because they are building on what they had in FO4. The trade window works like the vendor trade previously. You could only sell items to vendors for caps, not items. Having it work online in a multiplayer environment probably complicates it further.

I saw someone yesterday with the [Winter Mask](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/558684854103834635/unknown.png) but he said he bought it from someone. ;s
---
He was encouraging us to let all but 1 Robot die to get rare mask but no one listened. I assumed that was a fake rumor anyways but he seemed to believe it.
---
I got a white russian recipe but I forgot what it does
---
This 😬
---
i do it there or at the end when the sloth spawns because everyone ignores the small mobs when pubbing, i have yet to get cussed about it so i guess its fine
---
Yeah past few days
---
Its better that the rare masks are actually super rare, otherwise they wouldn't be that cool. If they raise the drop rate then everyone will have em. Quit crying cause you didn't get one, most of us haven't. 
---
Im corrected and its much bleaker lolol
---
You can only tame animals that spawn from random event spawns, not fixed spawns. Its a nice thought though ^^
---
+3 stats on low health lol
---
Do you know if there are any ways to get it in game where there’s an increased chance
---
Thats pretty decent of you. Its basically a hardened rifle straight from build. Usually i give people all the grenades on me, max upgraded pipe rifles and melee weapons, and health. This rifle will actually save me some crafting components.  
---
You assume they are not. Any "proof" they aren't obtainable is circumstantial at best. The "evidence" is just people banding together in a poll and what not. Many could be lying about whether they got it or not, even. Just to rile the community up. Wouldn't be the first time.
---
Point is, the point you're still missing. It shouldn't matter. Because, shit happens. If it isn't possible to get? Well, at least you got the event itself and likely got a lot of other awesome stuff. And if Bethesda finds out that 'oh shit l, we did fuck up here and make it literally impossible to get'? They've been pretty damned good lately for owning up to it and making amends somehow. Instead of dwelling on all the negative aspects of it? Quit ruining it for yourself and others by feeding into said negativity growing around the topic. Just be patient, and either you'll learn that you just had shitty luck, or Bethesda messed up and something will likely be done about it.
---
Lol ik but like what does that mean. What does it do for you 
---
Did you ever find the plans? I don't know which vendor to look in.
---
It's laughable to think that you are good in autoaim PvP.
---
I do that with my nephew at level 30. He tags everything then I one shot kill after I see he's registered damage. I share inspirational perk for the added xp. He gets at least 4 levels every time we play. 
---
The sloth glitches 90% of the the time anyway
---
&gt;Youtubers are in the business to make money only
---
This is why I unsubbed to all the Fallout 76 youtubers, even guys like Juicehead. The *constant need* to pump out almost near daily videos reporting on every little rumor or speculation starting getting questionable.
---
Exactly how many videos does somebody need of the banning of the guy with 900+ hours playtime? Every video was like "Weeeeell, I don't know if he was telling the truth or lying..." Dude, why report on pure speculation of what some random Reddit user said? There were so many questionable "facts" in that banning it made no sense in the first place. Everybody ran with it.
---
Hell, sometimes even the videos of the people defending the game are just as bad as the people who hate it.
---
I do give props to Widgeon TV though. His 76 lore videos are pretty good.
---
Sure while we are at this subject let's add cancer as one of the disease, Perm Disease effect: -100 AP, HP -200, CHR +1.
---
Anywhere that has legendary enemies, no armor has a specific place
---
Only people who have shit bild weapons and armore whant that...
---
ADS?
---
They're not gonna listen to them. Survival will be released as announced and changed around as Beth feels is needed. Whiny folks on reddit won't change that.
---
Awesome I'm on Xbox. My name on there is Putz4321, just leave me a message
---
Can't verify, because I've only seen him once. 
---
I always, always check the map before dropping a nuke. I look for clusters of high level people who are usually in a party together, and send one of them a quick message like "Queen fight?" If I get an affirmative I'll give them a 10 minute warning before dropping it on prime. If I get a negative (or no response) I'll just drop somewhere else like Morgantown.
---
&gt;I still encounter bugs that have existed from beta.
---
They only recently fixed the Momma Dolce's bug which could potentially wipe out your entire ammo stashes (as happened to me several times in beta). The game's improved a lot, but there's a lot of serious issues which still need to be fixed.
---
I enjoyed reading the commment. Great contribution. Thank you. 
---
Good to hear thanks for the work!
---
No issues here.  PC East coast usa 
---
Which would be great if we all had PC's. I do but need a video card and theres no way I'm starting over. This is for all the console players out there until they enable UI mods on console. 
---
It's currently rare to the point where you can't even buy/trade them among the community. ;/
---
Yeah I was trying chameleon armor and an explosive .50 cal and that wasn't working lol
---
aim down sights
---
The Beret is one of 16 items (together with the Plans and Recipes) in the secondary rewards list.
---
Ive done it about 8 times, 7 times he froze when he died and became unlootable, i was able to loot him once.
---
Ok thanks for the help :)
---
I have a skeleton mask... are there two different kinds of skeleton masks? Did I get a really rare one without knowing it?
---
Thank you for the explanation, I appreciate it. 
---
If you are on PC id like to buy your cloth
---
Cappy jacket and jeans at dome TNT 2 where you find the paint for t-51b. Patched suit is a static reward at mayor for a day mission, you can obtain that only here. 
---
it sucks that some people have to be as common as the rest of us. 
---
Like in any multiplayer game, lower tier items lose value as higher tier items become more readily available.
---
They need to do whatever the community wants right now. The amount of players they've lost is no secret and cannot afford to keep losing players with division 2 doing so well. 
---
They are letting existing characters roll over to the PVP servers. Because of that I am not going to even give those servers "a day"
---
 If everybody started fresh on even footing I would be fine. I would probly play on that those servers.
---
 As it stands right now I have absolutely no intrest.
---
Can we have an emote that says take your toxic shit else where? And fyi you do realize this is what bethesda intended the market to be like. 3 star legendaries are supposed to be hard to obtain and not cheap. So dont be suprised when someone hits you with an unreal offer as the creators of this game intended it to be this way
---
Out of interest, can you name one single online game that doesn't introduce new bugs every patch?
---
Solution:. Leave folks alone.  PVP workshops and your friends instead.  
---
Problem solved.  
---
Where do u have a source saying it's working as intended? If so, take the hint. They don't want anyone to have one so don't bother trying. 
---
Stay in the forest till you are around level 15.
---
Its been announced. Its over. They lost. We get to keep our toons and gear. 
---
Beth did the right thing
---
I’ve been lucky so far on Xbox because all the events I’ve been apart of have been pretty awesome. Everyone’s on mic and trading masks back and forth (low and high levels), dancing with the parade bots and being just overall pretty chill. Hardly any toxicity really, there was one guy I saw get pretty mad because he lost all his junk to other players. But he killed himself in the house on the first wave because he was using a tse weapon close range indoors so he should’ve known that would happen. But other than that from what I’ve played the event seems to have been a success, I did have a good laugh when someone dropped a nuke halfway through the event one time. I even started saving dup masks now so I could give them away to people after the event is over. Hopefully they do more events like this that brings everyone together and isn’t too tough because it’s been a fun time doing this event over and over. 
---
That is literally impossible any system designed for  an internet connection that is literally just a mouse on a wheel running would improve with greater internet connection.
---
&gt; it is also not our job to find this out. bethesda has to deliver a  product which satisfies the majority of the players and there are well  known methods to gather the required data. 
---
Yes it is because if we can figure it out it can speed up their fixing of the problem. Other wise they are forced to look though literally millions of lines of code to find the problem.  Which severely delays any fixes and in return keeps the game in an unsatisfactory state for much longer. 
---
Even just narrowing it down to number of legendary a person carries or specific combat style.  If a player has nothing but legendary equipment maybe the game errors for a moment when loading the loot so they can look into that specific thing. Maybe you kill them to fast so the server can't keep up and it simply lags when loading the loot causing it to be skipped because it thinks it is just a standard mob. 
---
Anyone who says it isn't player's job to help find bugs and glitches to help get them fixed doesn't know jack shit about game programing. 1 hour of game play by the community is more iterations and variations of the same simple action then Bethesda could do in the studio in 1 month working 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  Games are incredibly complex and the simplistic things can make or break parts of it. 
---
Remember Alien Colonial Marines?  Remember how hilariously bad the Xenomorph AI's were in the game?  A few years after it was released a data miner was going though the game code. Turns out the developer mixed up some punctuation. If I remember right a ; was placed instead of : that little mistake screwed over the AI. The AI was no longer tied to an area or knew were the player was.  The AI was fully programed and according to the guy once he fixed the issue it become a passable game.  But without that minor correction the AI had no idea what to do so it just wondered about. 
---
sorry my sarcasm might have been to vague. it was a gab at all the people complaining about the people getting unbanned and suddenly the game is unstable. but when they got rebanned everything is fine. honestly when im not at the parade i have 0 issues with lag or frame rate. its definitely because of the parade area
---
I didn't mean you are angry now, i meant when they occupy the workbench. I think we can all at least agree griefers suck, if the griefer is a minor inconvenience great, at least he's not wrecking my camp.
---
Yes you do need to bulk it to be able to sell it to vendors
---
Hope that i'll find it, is the only thing that i care about this event
---
1 star legendaries can still be quite good. Some great examples are Furious, Instigating, Vampire's (in some cases). But yeah, when compared to Fallout 4, they've definitely lost that 'premium' aspect since weapons can now have between 1 and 3 effects.
---
Regarding the price of a TSE Shotgun, I'm no expert but those don't sell for that much anymore. 9k was quite a nice offer considering that I got my TSE shotguns for 4-6k.
---
I wish I felt as entitled as you. It would make life so much easier always blaming someone else for what I feel I lack in life. 
---
People in this thread talk about how Bethesda released an unfinished game. Ironic considering that they wanted to push the release back, but they decided to stay the course on their release date because of backlash about "preorders/duty to your release date" nonsense coming from (primarily where?) ... REDDIT. do people have goldfish memories?
---
Agreed.   Beat me to it 😁
---
Nice! I never thought about the cultist outfit but I have the owl mask and the ritual robes and it looked awesome. Maybe not so much as Mothman style rather than an interesting "wise old forest spirit" look...with a giant head 😁
---
Presets is honestly the cleanest solution for the problem. It's something everyone could tailor to their spec needs: a CAMP build, Workshop build, Nuke Zone build, PVP melee build, etc.
---
Or just buy the serum in the white springs bunker
---
Thanks.
---
Yep. I’ve done that event 4 times and all 4 times the sloth was unlootable. 
---
&gt;The main problem with 76 is that good rewards are literally never the result of you being good at the game. Instead, they are totally random. 
---
The problem with most/all online games nowadays.
---
Yes, it's horrible sometimes. Once everyone ignored the dogs and bugs coming from behind, which spawns together with the sloth, I took'em down as fast as possible but still got one bot destroyed and rngsus decided to not give me a mask as a result, it's really annoying.
---
Blackbird Paint... so sexy.
---
It's true. I said that I enjoyed Battle for Azeroth and got told to play Classic which is the "True WoW" 
---
Oh shit, that just happened to me too about an hour or two ago. I play on X box 
---
same reason there are ads for alcohol on tv but no ads for cigarettes...
---
If i have the chance to get on, i can just make you the serum. 
---
Outrage gets the most clicks on YouTube.  You get the people who agree with your outrage, and you get the people who are outraged by your outrage.
---
So, if you're running a YouTube channel about gaming, you're going to be outraged by every new release, because that gets you the most viewers.  Your outrage, combined with every other YouTuber's outrage paints a picture of mass outrage.  Which then affects the people who haven't played the game.  
---
And when someone who's actually played the game shows up and says "actually, it's not that bad....", they're going to be attacked because it's out-of-step and disagreeing with their favorite YouTube "creators".
---
I hate children
---
With specific builds unyielding is the best armor ingame. It pretty mutch increases everthing, dmg, chance to dodge ect. Works with ranged ir melee and every variant of a bloodied build.
---
Are there two different types of skull masks? Did I get a rare one without knowing?
---
Should be the same exact one that the robot has on during the parade. 
---
Interesting will make sure to test thoroughly 
---
I know how to glitch inside of the map... Under a mountain theres a big space you can run around in. 
---
You can shoot out. People cant shoot in. . .
---
When's the tournament? I'm confident I'll be crowned champion 
---
Dont know whats going on exactly.. I have joined in 2 Fa. Events, first one did not go well all robots dead and we got nothing but second one gone well and I  won a mask... so I dont think the drop rate is soo low.
---
ever heard of mouth cancer?  just because you don't inhale doesn't mean it's not harmful.  I would also like to see a link to this cdc study...
---
Hold up a tick...you're upset that after doing the even 65 times it's gotten boring?
---
Like, what?
---
Whomever told you that is entirely wrong. Now if you had 5 Winter Masks/Sun/Jester/Goblin/ Pirate Skull/ it’s a different story. But you’ll be fine 
---
Pvp is really fun in this game,  its actually one of my favorite parts. I'm looking forward to this survival mode! I have a full set of assassin armor all sentinal except my right leg, working on that last peice. Gank city
---
Chances are, I'll give it to a friend if they want one, and don't get one from the event over selling it. 
---
you smell disgusting
---
All of the red dots on [this map](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png) represent junk piles that you can camp next to and harvest resources from.  Pick one, put your camp thingamajig near it, build a junk extractor, and then hook up some power. It will fill up every 20-30 minutes with 20 random pieces of junk, so be sure to stop back frequently and empty it.
---
At your level, the best spots are the one along the highway roughly halfway between Flatwoods and Point Pleasant or the one further up the road, just northeast of the pig on the map.
---
More tattoos already. Who the fuck gets a biohazard tattoo on the forehead
---
I tell you something I do, hopefully it’ll help some new players. I had issues squeezing off a shot at the beginning of the event. Now, I get on the roof of the post office next to the church, it gives me a good sight line to tag the sloth wherever he spawns. I always shoot it once or twice with a low level weapon so others can
---
If you’re low level, and haven’t killed the sloth, try this technique!
---
Also doesn't cure mutations so you can drink it to remove rads if you don't have starched genes
---
You guys want me to go to zenimax and complain? I live in Rockville 
---
Haha thanks, I know what I'm doing this weekend! Lol. First nuke time!! Thank you.
---
&gt;...many of these posts really come down to trying to shame Bethesda into changing something.
---
Welcome to this subreddit. Half the posts are people being intentionally hyperbolic in order to get Bethesda to change something they don't like.
---
it didn't even slow time until FO4, they could totally have jet
---
Before launching at prime, it's best to take a look at who is in the server.   You want to have 5-6  people in the server  who are past level 100.   That's because players past \`100 are sick of white springs nukes, have good gear, and are likely farming the very rare ultracite plans that only the queen drops. And they are probably beyond sick of shooting ghouls at white springs.
---
The key to beating her is keeping her on the ground.  I find that the "One gun army" perk stacked with heavy weapons is very effective for this, as it provides a crippling effect. 
---
We've beaten her the last 4-5 times we fought her using these tactics. 
---
Certain things beyond your control can fuck things up though.  If players with Marsupial mutations and jet packs are standing on the roof a  nearby building, or if someone has a C.A.M.P. built, she will barely land at all, and killing her when she's airborne is virtually impossible. 
---
Sorry :( I am, but my cloth is all on my Xbox account
---
That would be cool, however I am not on at the moment. I will be on in 3 hours so if you get the chance to get on then hit me up. (Psn- LP_Lombardozzi7)
---
Well, there is the Valid Ballot item, and if those were locked to a 1/account vote, and you got to fill out the form and stuff, then submitted it, that'd add alot more immersion.
---
I do know that one of the 'boundry breakers' got into a vault with a 'yay/nay' card swipe thing, and the ability to vote and such.
---
TL:DR; ballots would let us vote on alot of things at once, and if only the first 'ballot' per account was counted, this would allow a way to poll the ACTUAL player base and not get a flood of trollbot votes
---
&gt;uses the Gatling gun
---
I guess there goes 1/4 of my ammo *shrug*
---
Good on you!
---
The colors just match so well. Also the branches kinda look like bug bits
---
While I agree that the event isn't all about the masks, I still think the drop rate is way too low. For reference, raid drop mounts in WoW are generally around a 2% chance to drop, with a reset on the instance once a week. This is fair because players can try for it as long as they are playing the game, but that is not the case here with the parade event as it only LASTS a week with these insane drop chances.
---
The way a lot of MMOs reward players in limited time events (I know 76 isn't an MMO, but these games share a lot of DNA) is by having a reputation system. You get more reputation the more you do the event, kill enemies inside the event, etc. When you reach max reputation rank, there are rewards to purchase with your ingame money. 
---
Perhaps not the answer the game is looking for, but something to think about nonetheless.
---
On thanks
---
You can turn cloth into gunpowder with acid at a chemistry station. Whenever I run out of gunpowder while crafting ammo I usually have enough cloth and acid to get me back to 1000 gunpowder. 
---
The pve community is spiteful. They want revenge for being farmed for caps and junk for months. Even tho they are too scared to hit "seek revenge".
---
Thats why they suggest to reset builds for survival. Bethesda isnt listening. 
---
......he literally just said what it does 
---
I was there!  And can confirm. Did not get to tag the sloth. Also, 1st one I saw!
---
Yes. Sell all that cloth or dump it. You don't need that much ever. I don't keep anything over 50 except lead, adhesive, screws, plastic and ballistic fiber(never sell this). 
---
However, if your a camp builder, your needs for kick will be different. I just use my junk for bullets, armor and weapons. 
---
Its not the rarity that makes me want to wear it, it's the design. If it looks cool I will wear it.
---
I spend over 400hours on my character. Should i dump him because of you?
---
I do enjoy pvp and pve raids at same time, why should we have different charactera for both? 
---
They might be farming legendaries for when the Legendary Vendor is put in the game. 
---
&gt;The masks should be possible to get. They simply are not.
---
If they aren't obtainable, how do you know that the are actually a reward for the event?
---
Great Idea! Lit cigarettes and cigars as a wearable  item in place of the mask would be great... And if BGS is affraid that it promotes tobacco use they could add an effect like pollution from the Ash heap and gives you debuff if you get sick from using it. 
---
GG jamflex
---
You get a trophy, you get a trophy, everybody’s a winner and gets a trophy. This is what happens! 
---
&gt; I don't think you can loot a plant after someone else does?
---
Plant spawns are instanced, so everyone can pick the same flowers/logs/mushrooms/etc...
---
This tip should be pinned to the top of the sub haha. I been doing this forever now. Problem solved with this tip.  
---
Hope i don't meet you out there.
---
Fallout 76 came out at a time where big gaming companies dropped the thin veil that they were making games for any reason other than to make money. It's a time where "games as a service" is reading more and more like "how little work can we do to get money coming in", and "better with friends" might be better read as "the game itself isn't that fun". They launched a multiplayer game into this environment, to a community that was largely hoping for a single player experience. 
---
I don't think the game itself deserves half the hate it receives. I played it, feel like I got my moneys worth, and really only lost interest when the single player experience started to break down, (treadmill quests, and perk cards). I think my biggest criticism with it is they didn't fully commit to what it wanted to be.
---
Fallout 76 is, I think for a lot of people, a fall from grace; a jumping of the shark. It can be seen as part of the problem with the game development as it stands. Bethesda missteps in the first few months of release only fueled that, and 76 becomes the whipping boy.
---
Yeah, I know. It's kind of sad. Like, I don't expect a single person to change their view from my post. But I wanted to say something. 
---
Why do you need to die? I step out before the rads kill me, wash off in the shower inside the mine, then try again. Don't forget to tun on starched genes when you shower off, and turn the perk off again to acquire mutations.
---
Those slots have soo punchable face!.. bastards. Two of them dropped 0.
---
Power armor is weak in pvp. 
---
I generally don't get angry even when something like this is happening. If I can mitigate it I do, or I move on, but you and I both know there are people who don't and it fuels the whole phenomenon.
---
Wrecking the camp didn't bother me, it was super cheap to repair, it is worse when they stick around imo.
---
I’m lvl 240 I hit it once for the caps and screws it drops. I have no interest in a lvl 40 anything especially 1*. 
---
Whitesprings is still the best place for that...
---
I'm honestly surprised how people had any respect left for them at all after DA2 and ME3. IMO It was pretty clear back then that Bioware are done and the fact that Bioware foundrs left company after ME3 only reinforced that opinion.
---
Rare Super Mutant vendor
---
The devs on the twitch stream talked about it. They talked about rarer masks. 
---
Oh man how did I miss that
---
Ok thanks thats pretty damn nice
---
Did I say it needed to be cosmetic? In fact I suggested it to be a weapon mod that adds an interesting variant to two relatively static weapon types.
---
That mutated fern
---
&gt;Moreover lots of lies about the game were told upfront by Bethesda.
---
I'm curious what lies you're referring to. The only "lie" I know of had to do with the canvas bags.
---
To be honest I would not be surprised if there were different conditions for getting the different masks. Not just "all 5 robots survive" but *which* robots survive. I haven't been following the drama closely enough but I haven't so far seen evidence of people trying different combinations of robots. Mostly it's just TSE / bloodied powerplayers grinding 20 events in a day and complaining about not getting their rare drop by day 2.
---
And an ethereal voice says: 
---
 Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
---
Someone was doing this yesterday.  During g the frogs and the Wolves/Sloth, it was fine.
---
During the suiciders though, the smoke caused issues seeing the mobs until they came through and were much closer to the bots.
---
Very nice now I understand the popularity of that gear thanks
---
With 1\* they have to be just the right effects. 
---
Bloodied (most anything that people use), Instigating (on high damage semi-autos), Furious (on full autos), and Vampire all have value. The right max lvl weapon will go for 1-2k caps.
---
TSE is still a good combo and in my opinion a better combo for getting the most out of explosive. Best on low damage fast fire rate weapons where the static 15 extra damage is actually a very high percentage increase.
---
I'm pretty sure the mask drop rate is directly tied to the sloth. he is actually there to happily pass out the masks to everyone but before i can explain himself he gets killed. 
---
It obliterates the camp.  And leaves behind a frame.  But you can just run up and hit repair all.  
---
Make sure though if you have plants. Hit “scrap” and it used to give you back your plants so you can replant.  Idk about now. Haven’t tested this since all these updates.  
---
It has never let me or anyone vats me when I or they used it. It just reveals their location. No idea where you got that from.
---
I'm not telling you to dump anything. I was just stating my opinion that I will not be playing the survival mode as it stands right now. I have just as many hours if not more than you with this game.  Wouldn't bother me one bit to start a new character on survival mode.
---
The way this is set up seems like it gives PVP players the run of both servers. I've already seen people take an unfair advantage of going through workshops to kill other players where they won't get Wanted for it, basically just using them as hunting grounds before moving on to attack other workshops. Kind of annoying when they're after the fight and not the workshop. Imagine when they can do it with these new legendary weapons and some extra experience in stalking other players specifically to kill them. 
---
Legal reasons, id imagine 
---
Right! Like who cares about the scorched plague when we are all dying of dysentery
---
On ps4 press l2 while in construction menu and choose which lock level You wish to implement.
---
NP! Get out there and start blowing these bats back to Hell
---
adding you for some Excavator PA mods. 
---
btw do you do weapon mods?
---
I have a ton of mats, should be able to cover the mat cost.
---
I’m just tired of people defending Bethesda. There is something clearly off here.
---
Same thing happened to me. Turned 1 quest in, spoke with him 2 minutes later, got a new quest.
---
Very nice thanks
---
Very nice!
---
I ended up re downloading the game when the event came out to not miss out on the masks but after the doing the event one or two time i realized this was the most fun i had since release. Being able to participate in a fun oeaceful event with new people was a great experience that i hope happens again when the event is over
---
My friend killed my radtoad in February 
---
I would think that an extremely rare mask would bring greater diversity to the game, and that's probably what Besthesda wants. 
---
With class freak, one point in long shot perk, and using hip-fire increasing mods on your guns, the accuracy loss is completely neglible. I'm a rifle/melee hybrid and twisted muscles is definitely worth it.
---
ME3 was a great game overall... 'til the ending. The multiplayer was genuinely amazing, too. DA2, however... oi. Horrible. Re-using the same maps almost a dozen times in some areas, plus having dozens of quests which were literally unfinished or missing VO was inexcusable. At least DA2's story was compelling enough for me to finish the game, but as a game itself it was legit one of the worst I've played.
---
Part of me kept hoping they'd patch in major fixes and maps along with the DLC and fix the game. I'm genuinely surprised it didn't kill the franchise, especially after Origins was one of the best RPGs in its class. 
---
The majority of the times I've done it, it's been similar experience. I just did it, and at the end, everyone focused on the Sloth, letting the wolves and stingwings tear the robots apart. Still got the soldier mask, and a plan I didn't have. Which is what I'm after mostly. Plans. 
---
I just want a clean place to take Phsycho 
---
Yeah this should be further up. There's no rarity curve at all if we can only get 5 of them, and the other 5 are locked out essentially.
---
I've yet to see any players wearing rare masks ingame.
---
Just need a buttload of Acid to smelt it all down. 
---
I have a couple 1* Furious Heavy Searing Sharp Rocket Sledgehammers. Great example of a 1* being great. I get a great amount of damage (340 and growing i believe) from said weapons and I'm not even fully carded for them. I use them on silo runs solo as i can 1 shot turrets, robobrains and bots, 2 or 3 on gutsy and so on. A max fixed 200% one will last the whole way through the silo and still have life for 3-5 laps of white springs or whatever. It takes like 8 steel, 1 gear and some adhesive to fix.
---
It would take a nice 4 digit offer before I was willing to part with either. They're 1*, but for what i use them for they may as well be 3*. Guess thats like saying they're not pretty but they have a great personality.
---
And there is no proof they are obtainable. If it is please provide. Any proof by you or Bethesda would be very welcome. 
---
Overwatch, Killing Floor 2, TF2, Warframe (very rarely might introduce a new bug that they fix within a week). 
---
What is even the point of creating an item SO RARE that the ingame economy cannot function around it?  It just begs to be sold for real cash, ridiculous amounts, and likely 99% of us will never even see someone wearing it let alone have one.  Doesn't that just seem kinda stupid?
---
Be like the couch.
---
Pull out.
---
Cool. I have some weapon mods. I can check your weapon. But I don’t have a list of what I know. 
---
Got one with 10% whilst aiming. Can't wait to use it as well :-)
---
Having played all of those except killing floor 2 I can say for certain that you are wrong...
---
Read the comments over. There are people who have claimed to have seen people get masks. Like one or two people.
---
And in fairness, I can't prove they are anymore right then the people who are claiming there are no masks or other opinions. 
---
I saw a picture posted a day back with someone wearing old man winter mask, the blue one. That's the closest I've seen to any kind of evidence. Others have said they have seen the Sun mask. 
---
&gt;unstoppable costumes, +15 temporary HP.
---
I stand corrected then, my apologies. I was thinking about something more along the lines of a stat-boost consumable, but I do agree the Unstoppables event was problematic. Something like that does go against the spirit of a cosmetic cash store.
---
In regards to loot boxes though, I'm hesitant to judge yet since there are still the raids that haven't been released yet. It's possible that raid completion could give a lunchbox, but even that's just similar speculation.
---
Lock picker and hacker perks. Most of the other builds make better use of Intelligence and Perception, so I dedicated one slot to those two crippling speed bumps. Especially useful in those either/or situations like the upstairs room at the converted munitions factory where you can hack the terminal or pick the door lock.
---
They would look nice in a train station suitcase that's where all my ammo I don't use goes 
---
(Strictly speaking based off lore at this time) We have no beef, I admit it was the mistake of those who came before us! But we are different and have risen from the ashes to stop this threat! Even if it means working together with the enclave
---
Lies, show us the proof. 
---
Depends partially on level. Not pointless to me as I'm level 32. I don't farm xp, and other than quest rewards (e.g. Voice of Set), I have no legendary weapons. Got a bloodied level 5 pipe gun off a mutt once, so I gave it to a level 5.
---
An AA handmade would be a great step up from my no star heavily modded handmade I'm guessing. Hell, so would a vampire one.
---
I've been using this level 10 vampire fishing hook for the past 30 levels. There are decent one star legendaries out there.
---
IMO it doesn't matter. You can go spend 50+k caps on a full set of sentinel assassin armor and it will protect you from taking damage from most of a normal 200-300 damage hit in pvp but you will still be one shot by a stealth sniper with max AP using a crit sneak attack head shot.
---
True that. I forgot about consoles.
---
Well ok.
---
There are various in-game locations that allow this :|
---
True, but to suggest current gen hardware couldn't handle what I'm proposing is absurd.
---
Exactly this! Had a Furious Handmade for the longest time and it's been great. Felt a bit sad when I found a replacement... But what do we know... 1 star items are pointless.
---
I like the idea of a counter serum. But it should a separate serum.
---
I run all 3 star. 
---
I love my 1 star bloody buzz blade. I use it in PvP when players aren't as well geared as i am. 
---
Its fun and a little humiliating for whoever i kill with it. 475 dmg VFast speed.m @ 200% repair &amp; 10% health.
---
Most of the Survival mode weapons are specifically for PVP, do they really have a place in Adventure servers where a lot of people aren't looking for that as much?
---
Hardly defending them. I clearly just stated, there is the chance they fucked up. Giving the benefit of the doubt is not defending. At all. But at the end of the day, they themselves said it is possible to get the masks. That it was looked into.
---
So, there is no defending. There is no attacking. It's a matter of taking someone on their word, and in this case? They've been fairly forthcoming as of late so believing that statement and giving said benefit of the doubt has been earned to some degree.
---
My point is not to just openly accept things how they are, but to be patient and quit dwelling on the negative. Trying to find issues where there might not actually be any. It is likely just way too rare, but hell. Who cares? This isn't some participation award.
---
Ultimately, there is proof they see obtainable though. Even that bullshit poll did something right. According to that thing, five people were removed from the statistics for an inability to prove they had the rare mask. Whereas one person, did not get removed. Ergo, evidence was given. The mask is possible. Just unlikely. Either way, I'm done going in circles here. I do hope you can get your mask, honestly. But if not? I also hope you can enjoy yourself anyways.
---
I'm not a camp builder really, I just give people all my mats to build mine.
---
I agree with you when the feedback is rude or overreaching or insists on itself or is otherwise unhelpful. But when the feedback is a well articulated, polite expression of concerns about design decisions, that's an entirely different situation. 
---
Remember, the devs are making a 'game as service' with 76, and that necessitates listening to feedback constantly. And clearly Bethesda agrees because they've made a lot of changes based on that feedback over the last couple of months. ;-)
---
The biggest debate right now concerns allowing traffic between adventure mode and survival mode. This is a critical time to offer feedback on this aspect of the mode and will have a big impact on its reception and how active it is.
---
Basically I think your point is a good one but you're applying it as a blanket statement and that's kind of silly, hehe.
---
Pretty sure you can disconnect during the monster mash event to get that mask. Not supposed to but you can,
---
Yep. Considering how often we have to do naked photos for daily and weekly challenges they absolutely should add some sexy good looking underwear in atom shop. Default ones are downright ugly.
---
Exactly, that's what I've been saying. And on top of that they made it sound like it was possible to get all of the masks(and it sure as hell isn't).
---
They occasionally introduce new bugs, but certainly not every patch and not anywhere near the volume and frequency of this game.
---
Santa beard headless is my fav.
---
&gt;But really, who's running IE in 2019?
---
My employer sets the default browser to IE in the Windows 10 image distributed on all machines.
---
We use it to download Chrome, keeping the meta alive.
---
Read the fine print they are very funny. The terms and conditions are great.
---
&gt; affraid that it promotes tobacco use
---
We already have daily challenges to drink 25 bottles of alcohol, brew 50 bottles of alcohol, nukashine that causes hallucinations, blackouts, and your character wakes up in a random place. A little bit of tobacco use is negligible in comparison...
---
Plus there's even a legendary effect called Junkie that gets stronger the more chems you're addicted to.  
---
That's exactly it. It's not that I didnt get a reward. Its that I cant ever obtain it no matter what I have to trade because it's so ultra rare youd literally be a fo76 celebrity walking around with it on. I'll likely never even see someone else with one. 
---
The number of stars is meaningless. Exterminator's double barrel shotgun, 40 percent  more bash damage, 50 percent damage resistance while aiming... that's a three star legendary weapon. 
---
And it's garbage compared to my 1 star, anti armor .50 cal
---
Which are the rare ones? 
---
I did find the fasnacht mask in fort defiance before I knew about the fasnacht event. I saw the event , put on the mask with the straight jacket outfit and everybody was wearing a powerarmor on this event...if you have a mask , put it on... That's the point of fasnacht..
---
Fasnacht is often referred to as die drey scheenschte Dääg ("the three most beautiful days"). Wiki
---
So let's go out all together and have fun... Don't be greedy , let everyone enjoy the parade . 
---
2 days ago the parade got nuked.... It was quiet in the streets of Helvetia.The parade was ongoing but there was no one marching the parade....
---
If my camp gets destroyed, do i lose everything i stored in it?
---
Hey I don't know what platform you are on but I have a friendly bunch of players on PC that I met ingame, we have a discord channel and you are more than welcome to join. We are a group of europeans (slovenians, romanians and swedes) who like to play PvE casually. You have no business playing with a person like that, if he treats his friends like that imagine how he treats other people.  
---
I know the feeling of not wanting to throw away a friendship but realize it is not you doing it, it's him. He has no right to any of your stuff, I personally only share my stuff with people who are appreciative and would do the same if I was out,  
---
Let me know if you wanna play, I'll show you the ropes :)
---
Ill be smashing camps in survival. Gotta let people know where to find me!
---
The event is about the collectibles I don’t know where your getting your information from, the description of the event even states “participate in the fasnacht parade for a chance to win a festive mask!” Or something along those lines, don’t say people shouldn’t be mad because they can’t get the rare masks which that pole with the 6000 rounds of the event states you have a .03% chance of getting, that same one you said had inaccurate data even though the guy took out the ones which couldn’t provide proof. I can agree that those aren’t the only 3 masks in the game ( I know of 5 ) but it’s still too low a chance for a week long event. Then when you brought up that they’ll just sit in people’s stashes you forgot to thing about the fact that these are the rarest items in the game, why would you not wear them? My point is don’t come here to complain that people are mad about an almost impossible to get item.
---
Thanks for the service. I need the Scaly Skin serum. Believe I already have the mats for it.
---
I guess my idea of survival differs from others.
---
 I don't see how importing everybody's over level 100 maxed out characters with all quests finished is survival.
---
 My idea of Survival is starting over fresh and doing the story and quests with the added danger of full on pvp.
---
 Do people team up to do the quests and complete a story mission? Or is it in all out war to see who gets the quest finished? 
---
 Will factions emerge out of it or groups or guilds?
---
Right now all it is is putting a bunch of maxed out characters into A PVP free for all... I'll pass.
---
Lol, that might be harder than it sounds. I plan on using a minimalistic camp myself.  Essentials only :P 
---
Cool!! Add me, Join me, fast travel to me. IGN: jims1973
---
Prizebot sounds like Patrick Stewart.
---
That's not a bad idea.
---
You haven't ? That's weird, I would have thought you would have with how easily you dismissed the personal stories of all of those people in the survey that the ONE guy did (which you so quickly dismissed as nonsense for...reasons).
---
I have to wonder, why is it despite literally all the evidence pointing to the fact that something is very odd about the drop rates of 5/10 masks you decided to just completely ignore everything about the evidence and made this thread? Is it that you don't believe the people telling their story? Or merely that you just don't give a fuck and don't really care about the masks?
---
&gt; Emphasis here is to do this event to earn fantastic masks, plans, and other rewards.
---
However, this doesn't say, you are gaurenteed to earn a rare mask. And they have also been very clear. The chance to get a mask as a reward, is based on how many robots are at the end. So. It's already built in that you could possible get no mask. 
---
They further went on to explain that some of the masks, are very rare. Saying very rare means, that you aren't guaranteed that mask. 
---
To me, it seems like you are taking what they said about the event and presenting it as the goal of the event was to get the masks as the main feature. Like how you quote the complete this limited-time event to earn unique rewards. 
---
Well you can only get any of the masks as a reward from doing this event. Same of the plans and recipes. Once the event is over, you cant earn them as rewards any other way in the game, unlike the standard ingame loot. 
---
The event was never presented as, try and collect all Fasnacht masks for a special reward! Or Only the most luckiest or skilled of all players will be able to collect all the masks! 
---
The rare masks were offered as special unique possible item. 
---
Have friends. 
---
Break 1 wall. Get bounty. Then join their team
---
Do you run a suppressor or anything on the muzzle for recoil? I have a tse that has some wild recoil and spread during automatic fire. That being said I haven't used it in vats during PvP.
---
I've seen dogs walk up to my unresponsive rocket turrets and tear them apart, without the turret firing a single shot...while next to a light turret. 
---
Will do
---
I still have a furious combat rifle i use to save the ultracite rounds in my tse automatic prime handmade. Its actually one of my favorite buffs to find on a weapon!
---
Great story. Two days ago, a low-level player came running frantically into my camp area. Went out to see what was going on, and sure enough he was being chased by the Flatwoods Monster. I thought it was an odd spawn since my camp is near the ponds east of Top of the World, but I killed it for him and offered him refuge. A lot of crazy stuff happens in this game -- just learning how things work can take many hours -- and it's always good to go out of your way to help low-level players. And since BGS is making some great improvements lately hopefully there will be a lot more new players coming.
---
&gt;but like, the cosmetic only thing already turned to "well, mostly cosmetic" two months after launch
---
Except it did only last a week.
---
&gt;And all the loot box stuff is still in the code. Even if it's not launched yet.
---
And you believe it will be launched because............?
---
They're doing far better with the "flash sale" mechanic they've been using.  No need for lootboxes and the legal entanglements surrounding them.
---
If you haven't seen yet, here's what's been datamined for hairstyles. Most of these have been in the files since launch, so I'm not sure if we'll ever see them. Although the curly bun hairstyle is visible in a preview image for one of the new shop releases. So, that one seems likely.
---
[Hairstyles](https://imgur.com/a/U17jgNa)
---
Hope it serves you well! +karma 
---
Nah I doubt it the stash is a different Universal container
---
You’re welcome.
---
Well, their ballistic gun is either extremely powerful or has built-in armor penetration. They're also a lot tankier than the level 50 gutsies, so if you run into a pack of them you're going to get wrecked.
---
They don't have particularly good vision though, so stealth works ok. With my rifle character I used to just crouch in the middle and pop them three times each with a lever rifle. Dropped to two shots after a couple of kills with adrenaline. I'm currently levelling up a shotgun character and that's more of a pain.
---
I found a scorched toad all alone, I was able to tame him, but his level went from 30 to 5 after a relog.
---
Technically speaking this is still considered a beta release of the mode, so who knows what could happen if people whine enough. 
---
I got the invisible face beer helmet, looks pretty cool. 
---
I know two people that claim they fate 76, yet neither of them have played it.  They loved the previous game.
---
It seems to always drop screws, though.
---
Thank you. I appreciate it.  +karma
---
Yeah but it's low level legendaries
---
I'm only half master race. My Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram can handle it, but on board 1gb video cries.
---
Wow first time I’ve seen anything else! Was it a legendary still? I wonder if that appeared because you had more high level players?
---
Tesla stuff actually benefits from Rifleman. 
---
Those same people you say I am dismissing, are also dismissing anyone that claims to have seen the mask for themselves. 
---
I didn't dismiss the survey as nonsense. I said none of its data can be verified. 
---
Since you are pulling this, typical internet attitude of rewording everything someone says so you can change its meaning. I'm going to dismiss you and block you. Ta. 
---
My problem with this event isn’t the loot but the content itself, it just isn’t enough after all this time and it’s such a boring and tedious event to go through. I enjoy the idea but honestly I don’t see how people can praise this so much with just how boring it is. I am hopeful for what is to come (even though I wished it was all released together instead of being so spaced out, even if it meant we had to wait longer to get it all).
---
&gt;Game also went on sale for I believe half price 9-10 days after release and was an absolute mess
---
You've got odd "beliefs".  The game released at $60 and has never been priced below $40-something.
---
A whole lot of this outrage is based on a lot of people's "beliefs" which are just as accurate.
---
I am level...130 something. Every time ive done fashnacht (10 times now). I spend the majority ofthe time "dancing"around, swinging my tambourine and spamming wave emojis.
---
JOIN THE PARADE!
---
So far i have had this happen to me twice and both times my teammates would stay at the sloth and then i would jump to camp then back and the sloth would be lootable. The one time took two jumps but worked, if that helps.
---
do u have multiples of the same mask in your inventory?
---
True lol
---
LOL. This is the best theory. I support the friendly haberdasher sloth. 
---
I try to do this, but sometimes the newbies run away.  Its not like I'm a super high level, not even 60 yet.  Maybe its my cultist attire?
---
I feel you, but as an officer in the Enclave I have access to a shit, shave, and shower in the Whitesprings bunker.
---
Buddy this sub is NOT the fucking community!! It’s is a very very tiny part and far away from being representative of the whole FO76 playerbase. You know that, right?
---
i learned after the fact smh lolol
---
ive lost modded weapons and ammo this way didnt know i could make another bag and everything would reappear
---
And you see, I think that's cool, even if I don't get one 
---
Fast travel to Helvetia for free and it will be fixed immediately.
---
After hearing about all these fancy updates I decided to reinstall the game and try ot out again. Took 15 mins of in game lag, screen stutters and enemy bugs to make me uninstall again.
---
I'd love to see an event of this nature once per month be added to the game over time. Every month, a week long event. 
---
I'd also like to see much bigger events, that span more than a week, and takes a lot of work from everyone to beat the event. Not sure how it would look or function. 
---
Really snuck up on ya from behind
---
I've got that mask too. I found it in the wrecked train station in the savage divide. 
---
Yup but in a few of them you must own a camp to get thru... Via fast travel or a workshop object like a cooking station... Which you can then delete from the inside
---
I have the Bloody Mess perk card.  If it freezes like this, several swipes of my All Rise cause the sloth to explode. Then it becomes lootable. 
---
You can't know what it is right now, because you didnt played it, nobody does. Thats my main point here, i get you don't like their concept, but you also didn't make post about it like hundrets of other people i am speaking to.
---
I have 9 giants, 6 witches, 3 soldiers, 2 berets, 3 toothy mans and 3 owls
---
Really? That is good to know. Thank you. But the ammo weight is affected by the batterys included perk. Bethesda is all over the place.
---
Happened to me on PS4 too. Run a good distance away from the body. I had it once turn into a fly swarm and another time the body had moved and was accessible again. 
---
Because people are sick of games ending up this way.
---
I'd like more camp functionality as well. You get the sleeping buff and the instrument buff... how about if you use a tub or sink to clean yourself you get a temporary disease resistance buff? Why can't we collect fertilizer out of the portajohn LOL Why can't a fridge or freezer keep food in our stash fresh for longer? Some upgrades to CAMPs that aren't purely cosmetic would be greatly appreciated. 
---
&gt; are also dismissing anyone that claims to have seen the mask for themselves. 
---
Where are these people? I've seen exactly ONE person that said they saw a rare mask and they're not a redditor. You'd think that by now there'd be a decent group of redditors that had found and are actively working to dispel the notion that those 5 masks are simply unavailable, and yet..silence.
---
&gt;I'm going to dismiss you and block you
---
If I misrepresented your argument, please tell me how I did so, it wasn't my intention. I'm not trying to trick you into accepting my point.
---
Which ones did they say were rarer? If you recall.
---
System?
---
I've thought the same thing and it surprised me that it didn't already exist, since as you say, the photomode demonstrates that it's possible.
---
Nah. Im a bad guy
---
It’s not a popular opinion but I respect your honesty. I too was a bit disappointed after all the hype for the event, when I finally got to go to the event after work I was less than impressed. I feel that a lot of people felt the same disappointment, they just don’t voice it.
---
Aim for the arm holding the mini-nuke, they'll explode in 1 hit and leave nuclear material instead of an intact mini-nuke.
---
Seems to be a trend in nuke zones as well. I've missed tagging the sloth a few times during the event because a few people kill it as soon as it appears
---
We all learned this from one or more mistakes haha.  I was making ammo for a friend once because I had ammosmith and super duper. Guy gave me 1000s of steel and tons of lead.  I made 1000s of rounds of 5.56 and then dropped it all and lost it on the balcony of my camp hahah
---
Man was my friend upset.  And he was going to let me keep some ammo so I was sad too.  
---
We’ve all done it once.
---
&gt;Counterpoint: the minute Bethesda gave details about PVP in the base game, people suggested creating separate PVP and PVE servers. Then about 6 months later Bethesda (essentially) did this.
---
IMO, Fallout 76 is a test platform.  They're trying out ways to run an "online" game so that they can integrate multiplayer into future Elder Scrolls and Fallout (and Starfield) games.
---
So, PVP "gated" by slap damage.  Let's see how it works.  Hmmm...did not work as well as we hoped.  Ok, PVP servers it is.
---
Would you want to sell the flamer?
---
I run two accounts on two PCs. I notice that the paper bag does not appear until after the brief delay, but just after my character moves.
---
Honestly you are being the biggest jerk in the thread.  It's a shame because I agree with a lot of what you are trying to say, although it isn't your place to tell people that they shouldn't care that the masks are pretty much impossible to get.  The majority of people posting on the subject have been pretty civil and reasonable.
---
The ones that no one  is getting besides the 5 that everybody has 
---
Lol, good one
---
Yeah, it sucks. I'm actually one of the people who unsubbed here and subbed to filthy casuals instead. I stop by every now and again to see how this sub is doing, if it's still the trainwreck of entitlement it was when I unsubbed...and, yeah. It's getting better but that element is still pretty prevalent.
---
Launch was amazing bro. wtf are talking about?
---
&gt; The event is about the collectibles I don’t know where your getting your information from, the description of the event even states “participate in the fasnacht parade for a chance to win a festive mask!” Or something along those lines, 
---
it says unique rewards, like plans for your camp or fantastic masks (even rare). The event delivers exactly that. You can't have a mask be a rare reward if it's a guarantee. 
---
So yes, the event is about getting rewards for successfully completing it. I went for the recipes and camp stuff. I have all the regular masks and the beret each at least twice. I've given masks away. 
---
You are quoting a flawed, unverifiable one day survey about a 7 day event as proof. It's not proof. It's not accurate. 
---
Saying people's experience is proof is not the same thing as facts. 
---
Op's user name checks out.
---
LOL not is OSRS. The only runescape that actually matters :p
---
Depends on the user and what they are doing. If I have a surplus of 5.56 I like my 1* TS Handmade. I'll burn through those rounds as I'm doing cap stash runs or exploring until I use up that ammo (I primarily use shotgun/TSE lever action). That 1* is very effective but when I do Wes Tek or Harpers ferry I like my lever action with vats. 
---
Yeah, that's really helpful, thanks.
---
Awesome, thanks for pointing this out.  I'll try this next time.
---
:-)
---
Dare I say it? Lol
---
Snowflakes. 
---
Nice try Bethesda.
---
I can only loot him about half of the time. 
---
It's a inside joke. Vault dweller meat.
---
There’s a note just outside the brotherhood of steel base stating they were going to fix the scanner so “civies” can enter the base and possibly join the brotherhood, but they were far too busy with other more important projects that they didn’t bother. 
---
I am new to the fallout franchise, so the brotherhood is still a mystery to me, but I believed the Appalachian faction was friendly towards civilians, but after reading your post I think my idea of them has changed from “friendly” to desperate for recruits.
---
Regardless the note is still just outside there base stating they were trying to fix the scanners so civies can enter, the reason behind it is still a mystery to me!
---
(Please no spoilers for 4 or 76 as I recently bought both and would like to playthrough them and learn the more myself!) 
---
new Vegas is fine I guess, but I’d prefer fo1-3 spoilers if anything 
---
You just did to me what you say I am doing to others. 
---
I was investigating this as part of my camp design. Been looking for really really safe place for my power generator and my shower. 
---
It should be a separate **antidote** recipe, in my opinion
---
what are you offering?
---
Ah ok, understand
---
If you sell the straight jackets you find at fort defiance , the vendors give 20 to 30 caps a  piece. You easily find 4 or 5 ,maybe more
---
So now you're calling us fearmongers. Might as well call us alt-right while you're at it. Anyway, I don't think it really matters much what they do because of the legandary vendor they plan on adding. If they require new characters, maybe some will get lucky enough to get god-tier gear for RNG. But it's all just going to balance out in the end when they introduce the legandary vendor. With that said, they probably should just allow characters to crossover since the results will be the same months down the road. And I don't think anyone wants a weekly wipe unless they did a faction based battleroyle/ deathmatch mode.
---
Agree -- as many others have said, the rare masks are just way too rare. Even if they were a 1% drop chance, we would've seen dozens of people with rare masks by now, and we haven't. The game overall has improved a lot in the last couple updates, but once again BGS shoots itself in the foot with poor execution of a great idea. 
---
I hit the sloth once as well then step back and let everyone else go at it while I try to take out the wolves etc. It's ridiculous how many people are frenzying over the sloth that they can't let everyone get at least one shot in. Come on people!
---
store the extra ones and see if that fixes it
---
You want me to head west to heed the call? Or heed the call and head west? Or, do you just want me to head towards a call... even if I don't want to heed it?
---
You sit on that filthy toilet and like it!
---
You what I find so puzzling about every self-proclaimed "Raider" in this sub?
---
This unshakeable need to be "liked" by other players.
---
If this is genuine, I suggest creating a Survey Monkey survey and posting the link. It'll be easier for people to respond and complete. 
---
Being an ass?  Yep, that's still the reward.
---
(I know some people were/are experimenting to see what happens and how it changes the event, nothing wrong with that.)
---
How?  I am telling you that it isn't your right to tell people how to have fun in the game.  The topic on the masks being too rare is totally worthy of debate.
---
But it will take away the fun of survival if everyone is there and has god rolled weapons and can one shot and grief the lower levels or just casuals. They need to make you start a new character to balance it. If you don’t have the time to “grind” on a new character for a new game mode, then I would just stick to the regular servers until you have the time. 
---
Its one of those bugs that I hope we wont se removed. Its hard to roleplay a headless rider with a head :(
---
My Xbox goes back to the main home screen as soon as i enter the "National Radio Astronomy Research Center." I'm trying to finish an enclave quest, but it keeps happening. Not sure if this is on my end, or theirs. 
---
Good point, but as someone pointed out in another thread, the best part of the festival is even new players can take part. I wasn't thrilled to get my level 30 bloodied rolling pin, but it might have made someone very happy. I look at it as getting free candy thrown at me from a parade float. Bit O Honey? Ew... toss it to that kid over there, maybe he likes disgusting "candy".
---
Pippi Longstocking braids would be great! 
---
Hahahaha I died at this comment.
---
Interested in any trade? Otherwise if you can show it’s explosive and shoots flames 3k 
---
I’d give ya 2.5k for the tattered, but it could prolly fetch 5 to 10. Lol. 
---
Bomber is 500 or less. 
---
Reminds me of when my level 26 was finishing the Glassed Cavern. When I took the lift to the surface, there were two SBQ's. Had to server hop twice to escape them.
---
This applies to many star trek fans as well. Enterprise is good now, Discovery sucks until the next series is out.
---
Jet wasn’t invented before the war, it was invented over 100 years after the war, on the other side of the country.
---
Started with [this guy](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Iguana_Bob_Frazier) in the original Fallout.  It's people meat.  Iguana Bits are people, Iguana on a Stick is iguana meat.
---
Im just doing this for an essay. I can prove it.  The queen landing is taking off is like an autistic child throwing a ball in the air.

1 star legendaries were mostly pointless always. 9k for TSE shotty is a regular PC price.
---
I think I might have been in your vicinity recently:  [https://i.imgur.com/7V5dORQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7V5dORQ.jpg)
---
Was that poor sarcasm. I am not very invested, but i have done the even 8 times.
---
Well actshually,
---
Something that is "nearly unobtainable" is in fact meeting the definition of "rare." If it were easily unobtainable," say a 1 in 20 oddr simply unobtainable, it would not be rare.
---
Queen cannot be tamed, nor can hermits or foggies (they are too large apparently) 
---
Another thing to note is that 'garunteed spawns' aren't tamable, such as the Deathclaw of Deathclaw island, or the one that spawns in a certain mutation farming place.
---
Scorched cannot be tamed/pacified as they are infected with the scorch disease that causes a 'hive mind' effect, allowing Sierra Bravo's and Sieara Bravo Q's to controll them and such.
---
So, they're like hats in tf2? Unusuals are truly rare and people don't really complain about it 
---
Fair. 
---
I am currently a VATS, gun-fu, adrenline type build. I totally accidentally tagged a bot when I cleared out some enemies, and with a fully loaded gun-fu and adrenline blasted the poor fella in the face for like 350 damage. 
---
gotta be careful on that trigger finger!
---
It seems you people have forgotten the true meaning of Fasnacht. Its not about receiving rare masks or even plans but about giving grief to low level turds.
---
What level are you? With Ammo Smith and Super Duper you can craft a bunch of ammo.
---
It will always be at the Point Pleasant trader in the cabin near the Top of the World
---
I have been running the event on Xbox for many hours now still lots of played server hoping for it.
---
“Static 15 extra damage”.... what now? You talking about Explosive it 2-shot? Both are percentage-of-base-damage effects. 20% for explosive, 25% for 2-shot
---
&gt; And by that point sure, the people who have been playing for those weeks are on equal footing... but the same can not be said for all of the poor souls who only start playing Survival weeks after it's release or even months later. 
---
Frankly, I think that this was always the plan for those insisting that survival mode be started with new characters. 
---
"I'm gonna grind 12 hours a day and build myself into a god and then after a week I'm gonna stomp on level 20 characters for EZ caps!" 
---
First you have to travel in the wrong way then head up the right way and make your way back around to heed the call and pick up the phone. On another note I fixed it so thanks.
---
On my third run we couldn't loot ot because those motherfuckers killed it before it did it spawn animation lol. 
---
Its just aggressive business Tactics. Sorry you arent a mutant anymore, but we do have any mutation you want available... for a price
---
Yet u feel the need comment on a topic that others have done 100s of time. But ya good u picked up on the sarcasm. 
---
&gt;get your microphones working folks!
---
As I've said in another thread: I got kids, and y'all got filthy mouths.
---
rare means rare. 
---
maybe not everybody is supposed to get everything....
---
I had helped someone out last night didn't remember the name lol
---
Yes i am, i use this getup on my main rifleman  with a gauss, and my secondary char which is a low level melee
---
Gotta kill em with slap damage. Without them firing back to get a bounty.
---
They baited you fair and square. I do it to people all the time
---
Flagging both the attacker and defender for PVP when a workshop is contested made sense back when workshops could only be contested from within a tiny area around the control panel, but now that workshops can be contested from anywhere within the entire workshop area, the mechanics completely favor the attacker.
---
But addressing this doesn't require more complicated rules. Just change it so that contesting the workshop only flags the attacker for PVP—the equivalent of slapping the defender. The defender could choose to slap back to defend their workshop, or ignore and allow the attacker to take over the workshop. This would allow all PVP to follow the same, consistent set of rules, instead of having another, completely different set of rules for workshops.
---
What is that cap called?  I'm def jealous, as I've never even seen that before.
---
I see it a bit differently. I think it's people who have too much time on their hands, who can very quickly level themselves into a god like state where they can prey upon lower level players for easy caps. 
---
Oh Yh well ok thx 
---
Then I might've met you 
---
I love winter.
---
I hate spring.
---
I hate waiting.
---
Fuck Fasnacht!
---
The real reward is friendship. :)

They're made of 100% all-natural free-range organic non-GMO Soylent Green.

Bad design decisions you can identify on paper, you don't have to wait to know.
---
\-No human NPC
---
\-No text
---
\-No weight limit (who would have thought unlimited weight would not have cause issues?  Would have reduced duping impact too)
---
One of the basic premise of planning: reduce mistakes.  Beth takes months to resolve issues, why wait if they can prevent it now?
---
Lolz a last minute honeydo.. while you’re out getting milk and bread, go get some tampons and diapers.
---
Unless you are there to do the event and not related to the experiment, the result is the same
---
Nah dude, the begining is just hard like that.
---
I've done it 65+ times and then realized with the help of that reddit post I'm just as likely to die in a car crash vs. get 1 mask. With such bad odds I stopped doing them. I have like 3-7 of each plan and like 10+ of every real mask. 
---
Furious Sledgehammer is a pretty bad combo, no offense. Furious is good on low damage, fast attacking weapons. High damage, slow attacking weapons (especially melee) would want Instigating. Anti-armor is negligible when you have Incisor, Bloodied is amazing if you are a low health build (but even then may situationally be not as good as Instigating on a sledgehammer), and Vampire is also a wants-high-RoF effect because it’s a set value per attack, so faster attacks=faster healing.
---
No there's a MEGAsloth. 
---
Where do I go? ...Where do you go?! You follow the one fucking road you're on to me! Where do you Ok you're gonna go to the Texaco station. Take a right. Go 5 and a half miles south west. You're gonna see a guy in a yellow poncho. His name is Hank. He'll take you to the whopper Lair.
---
I appreciate that. Unfortunately, im on PS4.
---
But its the thought that counts. :)
---
You don’t understand our mindset. Most of these people (including me) see something interesting and want it, we’ll try everything to get it and if we find out it’s near impossible we complain but keep going your looking at the event with a different mindset, goals etc.
---
Sweet, now I can take a break, since I have no faith in getting any of the ultra rare masks. What do you want for it? 
---
Got the Extra hooks mod? It’s a good damage boost!
---
Ive got a bunch, but i want more
---
Yeah, the Tesla weapons are oddities in a lot of ways.
---
And a Bethesda employee confirmed to rarity of these masks 
---
"it only lasts a week" is what "temporary stat boosts for money" means. 
---
Is mods allowed though since it is online? I have stayed away from mods so far because I am afraid it could get one banned wrongfully.
---
Agreed, still disruptive, but I can understand wanting to know.  It still only takes a couple, and since several people have tried it already, there's no longer any point to it.
---
Well, its supposed to be a party. Who wouldnt want to walk around munchin donuts, sausages, and beer at a parade?
---
Besides, the beer and donuts dont spoil. (Dont know about the sausages yet)
---
If you have bloody mess, shooting the body may pop it, and you can loot the chunks.
---
Otherwise, you can wait until he becomes a meat pile and loot that.
---
That looks like my work
---
&gt; I have 5 characters to deal with 
---
Is your argument that you don't have time to level up another toon in survival, but you already have 5 in adventure? I could see if you had only 1 and not wanting to level a second, but it seems you are an alt-oholic already.

Not if you have pacifist on. 
---
I saw a quote the other day on IGN or PCWorld or something where the author said that upon release "the game had no story and was literally an unplayable mess with zero upgrades from Fallout 4". It's like all they did was watch YouTube videos. The game has a story, was absolutely playable (albeit with bugs), and sure it's similar to Fallout 4 but mutations, new guns, new location, what do you mean it had no upgrades?
---
It's the Fasnacht beret!
---
I have used the event to drop legendaries and stuff I don't want for free. Most things disappear after a while so I guess someone gets a gift at least. 
---
Clean everything really.  I want clean versions of everything we would build in the CAMP.  I would like a clean Nuka Cola machine too.
---
I don't know if you are still using the tesla but I found another instigating 1*. You can have it free of charge if you want it
---
Might have to follow suit. 
---
Just to be clear, by "get around 60% of defensive capabilities" you're referring to increasing your own defense and not negating (or getting around) 60% of another player's ass/sent armor, correct?
---
Andromeda definitely had issues but I really enjoyed it was was pissed when they said they weren't doing anymore with it. Just like with Andromeda it seemed a lot more of the complaining seemed to be based on that it wasn't what people wanted and wasn't enough like the original series same as a lot of the complaints I see about 76 is it isn't enough like NV or old fallouts. 
---
I too have kids and use my microphone so they don't hear the profanity through my TV. 
---
I can agree on that. Or just throw some caps around and buy their way. 
---
As did you captain witty. Also proudly taunted a stranger on the internet for having differing views and trying to have a discussion on something 100s of people commented on. Real psychological growth there bud. Glad you are keeping a level head in the face of adversity. I won't be responding  further to you. I consider this well of intellect dry and feel no need to validate it further.
---
Haha, I want to but my power supply for my XB1 exploded and melted. Hit me up again on Sunday or around that time because my replacement is arrive it Sunday.
---
You can loot him when he becomes a meat pile.  Or if you have bloody mess, you can shoot the corpse and loot the resulting chunks.
---
Nice 
---
How?? 
---
i appreciate the interest but i think im going to hold onto it. it's a legacy item, so im not really comfortable with letting it go for 3k. 
---
Is the event already over or?
---
Total bullshit 
---
You didn't get nothing. You just didnt get what you want. You'll have masks and plans coming out your ears if you grind all week
---
He turned into a meatpile once for me, other times i just wait and it doesnt happen.
---
I’m available. 
---
i definitely like the concept 
---
Something I'd request  before Summer is displaying the name of your character as it appears on the Vault-Tec ID. It's one of those little immersion things I think people would enjoy. And hey, if you come across somebody named 'shitfucker' or something oh well but I know I''m a person that wants their character to be a character, not just a gamertag!
---
So the other day I was up and about doing some events when suddenly ive noticed a little player dot in close procimity my georgeus little cottage. As I wasnt sure if that player is friendly or not, I fast traveled quickly to check who that might be. 
---
My build sneak, range, vats, chameleon. So I sneaked to have a peak and there he was. Lvl 35 with his own little wooden shack. Campfire, couple workstations and materace on the floor. He was minding his bussines crafting something, obviously not aware of my presence.
---
Quickly I moved back to my house, picked it up some leggies, stims, (icluding my first TSE drop Fat Man) and I aproached him droping all this stuff in paper bag. 
---
I startled him suddenly and I bet he wasnt sure what my intensions towards him are. I was pointing with my gun on the bag (they really could make them more visible) waving at him. It took a while of convincing him Im not dangerous and ive got something for him. In the end he wave at me and Ive went back to minding my own bussiness.
---
The event is really fun but be prepared to run after the event. Griefers have been attacking lower level players the last couple of times I did the event. I wish they kept the PvE active for a few minutes after the event concludes so photos and trading can take place without being grief'd.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what Bethesda intended on how rare they should be.  I want rare items in the game, so personally I don't think that it bothers me that everyone won't have EVERYTHING.  I think it is too rare that I probably will never even see one of the masks in the game though based on how things have gone so far.  If someone spends all week grinding this event they probably should end up with 1 of them.
---
Do your events and daily quests. Some people are really high level because at launch super Mutants and Glowing Gouls gave likr 500-600 xp per kill. They nerfed that right away because all I had to do to level up was go somewhere and kill a bunch of enemies with some friends and boom like 2-3 levels. Now it's take a lot longer and I've found doing the events helps pass the time and some are really easy for 300xp.
---
Problem is I need to hear the kids.  Or more precisely, I need to know when I can't hear the kids since that's when they're causing trouble.  So, headset isn't a good option.
---
TLDR: I made a poor assessment and joined the power armor blockers in the name of science!
---
While some cunts truly do seem to want nothing but to break shit and drag you through their misery, we looked into this exact activity yesterday and found that in this case, that’s not what these guys are up to. In fact I was totally wrong to call it like I seen it and learned a lot about how some methods for loot appear to look 100% like trolling. 
---
After running into this a few times yesterday and after an extensive discussion with these people I ended up joining the ranks instead of opposing.
---
What’s happening here looks like trolling but turns out that’s not the deal here. 
---
Some people have been testing the parade loot pool by nuking the Event while others are looking for other successful ways to get ultra rare masks. In this particular case we are blocking one select bot (usually Death) to the back of the line away from the rest and allow the other 4 bots to be destroyed by the frogs, mutants, etc. 
---
Yes, failing to survive 5 bots gets less chance at masks but less of a chance at the same common5 everyone has already. By allowing one bot to live we are attempt to trigger the loot pool in a different fashion. It appears surviving a single bot would trigger only a 15% chance at a mask. Sure, a fair amount of the time some of us don’t receive a mask at the end. The idea is that with five bots alive equals a 100% success to get a common mask, so we wondered if only trying to be awarded from the 15% chance (most difficult odds to win against) might trigger access to the “full pool”. 
---
We saw no visual confirmation of anyone getting any ultra rare masks from completing the event this way as of yet. Though single guy (or maybe a troll-man hybrid)  spoke up at the end of one run like this and said he got the Death mask but then declined to share it with anyone so its yet to be confirmed if this could be a success. 
---
How many rounds are you looking for?
---
That sounds like a bug to be honest. A fun bug, but a bug =).
---
It still shocking to me you will find some people that will try and say the original ending to ME3 wasn't that bad. I wouldn't have been mad if they killed Sheppard off and that was that but the expectation that I am investing the time I am to save everything and I the end it doesn't matter everyone will ultimately die is lazy and shit writing. 
---
Yea I feel you. I have a bloody explosive flamer but it shoots slugs, not flames. Actually I have every explosive energy weapon. So what would you feel comfortable trading it or selling it for?
---
Tru dat
---
No :(  I haven't found a single mod for it, or gotten any from scrapping random hooks that I have found in the wild.
---
Its been like that since day one,  so i am used to it
---
Oh, I use a Sony headset. It just goes in one ear. 
---
Yeah, this is what I'm pretty sure 76 is. They reused most assets to keep the budget low allowing them to make money off testing how the engine can be improved/used online.
---
Ditto
---
Wow frashgakt sounds fun
---
Even trade for whatever you have
---
When you were at his level they hadn't nerfed the xp gain from high level Super Mutants... You used to get 500-600 xp from each super mutant. I't like 1/3 of that now. 
---
I am only referring to own defensive stats and effects, and 60% is a roughly estimate. Lets assume I have full assasin sentinel set build and this guy. Lets assume no healing effects and 100% hit ratio. It means that it will take around 60% of what'd down sentinel to kill my PA guy once you depleted his AP.
---
This is assuming nonVats regular shooting of a stationary target. Vats is different beast.
---
Which call do I heed? The one where Maxson sais he trusts Taggerdys judgement or the one where he said no nukes ever?
---
Do you think they're holding off on some customization like the grease fore heard to avoid a blackface scandal?
---
Got the same with a Tesla. Shoots slugs. Most people tell me that’s how they are but a few say they have one that shoots electricity. 
---
Did you want sleeves? Or more face tats?
---
Seeing all these posts about how people can’t get the masks It feels as if lots of people don’t understand the meaning of rare.
---
I’d rather wear no underwear than that underwear. The infections my lady bits would get from them dirty assed things. *shudder
---
Under what category? I can’t find it. 
---
Just fast travel to Helvetia. It'll fix it.
---
Try it some more, you’ll see, it’s not exactly easy,  I usually spray my explosive Tesla shotgun around them, then there’s a brief moment after that they are staggered by the hit that you can vats them.
---
am still looking for a good one to dump all those ammo :)
---
That’s asinine, I only do it near the house because I know their spawns and I can keep it away from the boys.
---
Claiming all workshops is good xp. Leeching at the queen event is the fastest leveler I found for low levels. You can collect cranberries there to make juice, sleep. There's no penalties dying so have at it.
---
Now put on some sunglasses or a Santa beard to complete the look
---
The problem is isn’t that their pointless. The market is over saturated with both 2-3* items and everyone (nearly) have an abundance of caps. 
---
Sleeve tattoos is needed 😁 and giant beards 
---
Oh good.
---
Usually?  Not on PC then.  I think ive come across 2 or 3 parties since I started playing about 2.5 weeks ago.
---
It's annoying, but unpopular opinion is that it is that much more exciting to get a max level 3 star piece even though it's a TSE quad pool cue. 
---
You’re pretty accurate there. We completed the event several times yesterday with only one bar virtually putting it in a 15% chance of getting a mask. A lot of the time some of us didn’t get a mask but we weren’t sweating it given we have so many duplicates of the common five already at this point. By only trying to access the weakest or most difficult loot pool of 15% people are trying to discover if the ultra rare masks might be triggered here. 
---
Given the majority of people running the event are finishing with five bots constantly given the lack of difficulty, Polls have been taken and no one seems to be getting an ultra rare from completing with five, so Like yesterday we will continue testing completion at the weaker end of things in hopes to find a breakthrough for the community.

Keep your shower stashed/stored. Drop it when you need to use it.
---
Gotta keep placing your camp in spot halfway down a mountain. Drop a cooking station.. See if it sends u thru the wall.. Fast travel in and out. Test. 
---
Drop a camp again. And repeat.
---
oh well then maybe im mistaken on how it operates? i haven't used it since i got it, so i could be wrong, though i could have sworn it shoots flames. would have put money on it. but if yours doesn't work that way, i don't see why mine would be different.. I can check when i get home in a few hours and let you know.
---
Actually, I do understand your mindset. I used to collect toys with my husband. We had a whole room filled with our toys, and friends often joked our place looked like two 9 year olds had gotten an apartment together. 
---
We still have toys around the place. We don't collect anymore, but we do buy stuff from time to time because the subject matter holds special meaning to us. 
---
I get there are people that like to collect all of stuff in games. But this event, in fact this whole game isn't designed around doing that. So right there, there's a clash of of want vs design. 
---
the lore was retconned, forget which terminal but in FO4 there is a terminal entry that indicates it was pre war
---
The one you find in Garrahan never was usable, it loses the skin as soon as you pick it up. The one that drops from SBQ is the only one that retains the skin when you get it and it's always lvl 35 and non-legendary unfortunately
---
I hit him one time with my combat knife to let others hit. I’m level 114 and have seen others hit it with explosives. 
---
 "No real added bonus except more time playing the game to grab rare weapons. "
---
That is a real and huge difference.  The level 50 who has a pea shooter and bad armor has no chance against top guns and armor.
---
well, in this day and age, it seems being able to understand is rare itself. 
---
thank you.  I am looking for people to present issues with it so i can co sider how they would be avoided or mitigated.
---
It depends on the effect and how you want to use it. 
---
For example, I have a 1* Zealot’s Handmade that I modded with an auto prime receiver and armor piercing magazine. It’s an amazing weapon for hunting around Fissure Site Prime. 
---
As for selling value? I think they’ll have some value in player vending machines. Most players aren’t scouring trading subs to get top tier gear. I imagine a 1* weapon with an appropriate effect—like an instigating sniper rifle—will sell in that scenario. 
---
How rare is too rare though?  That is the big question.
---
Cool read thanks!
---
I use speakers and headphones.  The headphones dont stop me hearding the kids and ive got a bloody nice set.  Also, you can have one ear half off.  Honestly, in the words of Tod Howard... It just works.
---
I've heard that if you're on top of the launch tube when it opens, you fall in. The missile itself has no clipping so it doesn't push you out of the way. You'd have to know there's going to be launch because the launch notification and the opening of the tube are almost simultaneous. My camp is right next to one and the combined alert and launch sounds usually give me quite a startle. 
---
You took this epic journey and then the game asks you "How do you want to fuck over everything you've fought so hard to save?" Not a single ending was remotely satisfying. It'd be like eating the best pizza you ever had in your life, and at the very last bite, you spontaneously vomit. Sure, the rest of the pizza was great, but all you're going to remember is that last bite.
---
May your server be stable and your lag be unnoticeable. 
---
I don't think the game engine can handle sleeve tat or that it's coded. Hence only face tats.
---
There are a couple thick beards tho. Unless you want a ZZ top thing?
---
Everyone.  It's always been that way.  The stars only mean there is a chance for a weapon of that star quality to drop, it's just as possible to get 1 and 2 star items from a 3 star kill.  Just like those killing the SBQ getting a 1 star wooden leg, it just happens.
---
I just did it again and got rewarded!
---
&gt; There's also no reason that they couldn't add a toggle in the graphics settings on PC
---
Implementation time and not really being worth it.
---
&gt; The engine is completely capable of doing it, as demonstrated in the plethora of shadowcasting mods created for Fallout 4.
---
I am well aware the engine can do it, but can it do it on a per user basis? I don't think so, they would have to take the time and work that into the engine, which really isn't worth it when they have other things to work on.
---
Is the quick swap planned to be fixed as well?
---
We need longer hairstyles for female characters! Just because we're living in a post-apocalyptic world, doesn't mean we don't wanna look pretty with long, shiny hair!
---
LOL!  In F2 I think you discover iguana its is people!
---
That may be yes, yeah zz style beards 👍
---
Kids have filthy mouths. I heard one swearing up a storm and accusing the robots of doing drugs. 
---
Again, what I need to hear is the silence.  ‘Cause that’s when they know they are doing something they shouldn’t.  Like covering the couch with flour.
---
at least its not a drill or syringer ...
---

---
The sloth must always appear.  A top legendary appeared toward the end of the two parades ive taken part it.  Great fun.  Appeared at the same place too, which is helpful if you didnt get a hit on it before...
---
Ah, ok...the one thing I don't have from the parade.  Thanks!
---
Yeah, figured as much. It would be nice if he did sell it though. Modus sells Enclave apparel I believe, so it would be nice if each location/faction vendor sold their corresponding gear. That way you could get a new uniform from the fire station vendor. Or the police uniform from the vendor at the airport for example.
---
1. Will we still be able to join up into teams? **Yes, but I don't know if friendly fire will be a thing or not.**
---
2. Will there be new PVP only events in locations (Deathmatch, King of the Hill)? **Maybe, don't know yet, would be cool though!**
---
3. Will I lose caps on death based on my level if I were to be killed by another player? **AFAIK yes, so don't bring your level 300.**
---
4. If yes to 3, then will it be doubled because of double the reward that’s stated or just stay at the value of my level? **Yes, it will be doubled, and you will lose double the caps.**
---
5. Will I earn double caps reward every time I kill a dweller, even repeatedly? **Yes, and they will lose double.**
---
6. If Questions 3 and 5 apply then couldn’t this lead to a really bad exploit? (Two buddies same level taking turns killing each other earning double while only losing half of what was just earned) **See answers to 4 and 5.**
---
7. What’s keeping griefers from Standing in front of vault 76 waiting for someone to respawn there if players that are new and haven’t discovered their first train station or set up camp yet to respawn anywhere else? **Boredom and the fact that you gain an invulnerability period when respawning.**
---
8. What is keeping grouped players and high levels from just griefing the entire map? **Nothing, and that's kind of the point. You can't see other players unless they have a bounty though, so hunting them will be tough.**
---
9. If CAMPs are attacked do you still incur a bounty? **Not sure, but hopefully not since this is supposed to be all out pvp.**
---
10. Does our CAMP turret defenses automatically target other players if they come into range? **I'd assume it works just like normal game. If you attack them, they attack you.**
---
11. If 9 and 10 apply, how will you be able to rightfully defend yourself if you become attacked by CAMP defenses without occurring a bounty? **Don't shoot the camp.**
---
12. If destroying CAMP objects does not incur a bounty, what’s keeping people from destroying everyone’s CAMP they cross? **Nothing, and that's the point of pvp server. Go nuts.**
---
13. To achieve leaderboard status and then become a target on the map for survival time, what’s keeping me from walling myself inside of a cave, or hiding inside my CAMP where to need to destroy my structures possibly getting a bounty placed on your head for doing so? **Nothing but bored and the fact that once you're on the top spots of the leaderboard, you're visible to everyone.**
---
14. Will trading still be allowed, and if so can we be killed during trade window? **Yep, I'd do it in adventure or only with someone you trust.**
---
15. Will there be safe zones? During teamed events (SBQ) or when trading with bot vendors? **Doubtful on both. Watch your friendly fire or don't do those events, or bring a really strong team.**
---
16. Does each challenge in the weekly provide a new weapon, or just one new weapon from completing all the weeklies and waiting the next week for the next weapon associated with those weeklies? **Sounds like it's a max of one item per week, and the item changes every week.**
---
17. Will the bloodied explosive sentinel unyielding builds be nerfed? **Assn/sent will hopefully be nerfed, because although there are ways around it, it's basically godmode right now. Bloodied explosive shouldn't one shot as easily, but then again, if someone is at 19% HP, they're also vulnerable.**
---
18. What happens to the mode when people get fed up with being destroyed by those builds and unable to do damage to them that the mode is only full of those builds trying to kill each other? **They will quit, no one will play it, which is what I've been saying for a while. The current pvp meta is garbage and changes need to be made for this mode to be successful.** 
---
19. If question 18 occurs how will I know if anyone is in the server or if it’s dead, will I automatically become top 3 for that server? **Social menu will still show players on the map with you I think, just not their position, level, etc.**
---
20. If and once I complete all the challenges to earn the new weapons, what’s going to encourage me to continue survival mode? **A sense of pride and accomplishment.**
---

---
Pm me il get you the info for my discord group.
---
What about when picking up items on f the same type they are sometimes automatically favorited? Happens a ton to me with hunting rifles
---
Yep I was pissed for a good week over that ending. I could not fathom how they came up with that ending and thought this is a good end to the series. 
---
Sent the message mine is Kingisback1313
---
True. 
---
Feel free to let the “community” know if u actually see a rare mask. 😂😂
---
Same principle no? Maybe it’s the location. I mean I’m on pc, in the living room while the kids are mucking about the other end of the room. I know what they’re doing. But then I also know I don’t have to worry about them doing shit like covering the room with flour or some stupid shit like that. 
---
You on PS4 You can keep your plastic I think I have 2.
---
But the question is, do they miraculously have working plumbing as well, or are they just for show?
---
I agree. It's been an issue when I join the event with my wife who is low level. Fortunately for those who never tag the Sloth it usually drops crappy legendary trash gear so the masks and plans are much more valuable.
---
I have a bomber jacket for 500.  PSN: rip67 
---
Should be on later tonight and definitely over the weekend.  
---
Well from my understanding, you only get a bounty if a player dies, and that player chooses to pay for putting a bounty on you in this new system.  Did I read that incorrectly?
---
Yeah this is a 60 bucks mmo out for 5month now. Either you've had your money's worth or it's time to quit anyway, but don't come on new events pretending it's unfair that as a paying customer you don't get all rare items immediately.
---
So you only need the cannibal perk when you “know” it’s human meat lol but if you just think it’s iguana no perk required dig in. 
---
I’m personally continuing to run it for the exclusive CAMP plans. I’m holding onto the plans I’m collecting because I know that I’ll just make someone’s day allowing them access to a piece they won’t have for months (if this is a repeat event) or possibly never.
---
As a CAMP fanatic, I just know that if I didn’t have it, I would sincerely want the Old Man Effigy. And one day, I’ll be able to make that come true for someone else.
---
I would be happy to pay 9k for a TSE Combat Shotgun only because I want to try that gun out, dearly, and 9k can be farmed in a few days of vendor rotation which I would do anyway. Perhaps people like myself are to blame. I say that because I don't understand the value assigned to weapons and armor being that it fluctuates seemingling on a whim. As for 1 star Legendary items, I usually vendor them or leave them in overseer chests. That's also probably hurting the market.  
---
You cant, i tried.
---
So... you're saying FO76 was never intended as a pure game but was, in fact, a vehicle for experimentation and study, regardless of the feelings of the players...  
---
That is incredibly meta of Bethesda...
---
No. I think this is extremely representative of the part of the fan base that matters. The one that cares and wants 76 to be exactly what it deserves to be - a great game.
---
May i have you sausage plan good sir?
---
As an scholar in such matters I would say that Maxson's trust of Taggerdys judgement is a malleable endeavor. As such when Taggerdy brings up the nuclear option Maxson's trust is shaken. One can infer that the nuclear option should never be chosen as it is one of the things Maxson blames for the fallout happening. Now if you where orthodox the answer would be clear and nukes never be used, but if you are a realist you know that it is the best option to deal with the scorched. Therefore the answer is to chose where you stand in belief and interpret the holos from there.  
---
Holding out for a non creeper slicked back hairstyle 
---
Then why post here? Clearly the feeling is that posting where you believe the community is was less appealing. If you view the sub as such a tiny representation then why even feel threatened by what it says? 
---
Regarding the drop rates. I think if they had more tiers of rareness on the rare masks it might be more compelling to grind this event beyond about 46 runs (around that many runs you're very likely to have all the plans/beret and common masks.)
---
So if some rare masks had a higher drop rate and some had a lower, you'd still have hyper rare masks, but maybe have some rare masks with a higher drop rate that make it more likely you'll be rewarded for your efforts if you run this event many many times in the short window of time it is available. Right now with the guestimated drop rates on the rares, it's really unlikely you'll get anything even if you grind this event constantly in the limited time it is available, which can be viewed as a waste of time after getting all the common stuff and disappointing for people considering grinding it to get cool masks they're interested in.
---
Minor complaints about the drop rates aside, I like the caps, XP and participating with other people in the event. I like to tag the sloth (not nuke it) and hope for a good weapon I can drop for a lower level player. I'm very happy with all the cool CAMP plans. Overall I'm very happy with the event and glad to see a lot of people participating in an event together.
---
(Also, they're are always(?) a ton of critters around the fast travel point in the NE wooded area by the road if you're looking for intestines for the event. You can use VATS or berry mentats to locate them if you're having trouble finding them.)
---
She approved it. It’s a community college.
---
Ark is extremely different than Fallout.
---
Fallout 76 is taking the traditional MMO path and is just giving us a pvp queue so to say. 
---
So you watched the same youtube video I did huh?  Well I didn't drink his kool-aid myself.  Every game is a test in a way though, but to say 76 was made for the sole purpose of testing how multiplayer could work in their other games is a bit of a stretch.  
---
Nowhere did I say anything was guaranteed.  I'd encourage you to reread what I said.  All I did was simply quote what BGS and it's community managers have said and explained the reason people are upset with drop rates.  The goal of the event as per them is to earn fantastic masks, plans and other rewards.  That's what they are saying.  Show me something from stating that the event is to play with low level people and have fun.  That's not what this event is about one bit.  With that being said, earning a soldier mask, owl mask, or witch mask in my opinion still satisfies what they are stating simply because it is a time limited event and once it's over you can't get those masks again.  I have no problem with what rewards are dropping.  I simply understand other people's frustrations with the lack of rare mask drops which again, I never once said in my post it's a guaranteed drop.  If that's what you assume I said, then you're taking that from the quotes that I posted.  Quotes coming from game devs and community managers.  
---
**(something controversal happens)**
---
The verdant season in BethesdaGameStudios is now over
---
I think you might have messed something up sir.
---
Decisions by committee are not the ideal solution, either. They don't take into account that bethesda has their roadmap, they have a lot of design elements probably in place already. I think the current way is the best compromise - the community gives it's feedback and criticisms, bethesda takes it (with a grain of salt I hope), and makes decisions that factors in their own reasons (resources/unannounced design features/metrics, etc.).
---
Case it point, their dealing with the duping. They got rid of a lot of the egregious stuff, but left one copy for everyone who had it. Was it the best solution? Probably not. But it was the best compromise, as it didn't punish non-dupers who traded for their item, while punishing the worst dupers. I think bethesda can do what's right and best for the game as a whole, but it is important for everyone to give their feedback in a constructive, and respectful manner. It's not the fastest way, but it's the best compromise all around.
---
You can also now tame mole miners as of the most recent patch
---
You're welcome.
---
It took a catapult trap set up on cliff at elevator, 3 mutated members of party for strange in numbers.. jet pack.. stand on catapult hit launch move forward mash jet til out.. then button spam jetpack so it keeps activating as it gets ap.. enter into watoga limits slow down on jet pack and glide in to roof.. no chems involved. Took me about 10 tries to land on it.
---
Can we not have both a fun AND rewarding event? Crazy thought, I know, but it just might work 
---
But even the Enclave can appreciate simple creature comforts while out in the field. 
---
Just formatting for easier use.  I haven't answered yet.
---
You
---
Nah, I came up with that thought all on my own.   The game is smaller in development scale than FO4 or Skyrim.  It’s their first online game that isn’t just licensing the IP.  And it’s trying out a bunch of new mechanics to see how we play them.
---
That doesn’t mean FO76 isn’t its own game or a partial game or anything.  It means that there is an additional goal behind the dev’s decisions.
---
Coming soon: bring your Fasnacht masks to the Purveyor to exchange for a rare mask!
---
 But people are getting rewards. They are getting masks, plans, recipes and sometimes legendaries. 
---
So true...
---
Yes, or if plans to create it were available from scrapping or from the vendor.
---
Yep, shotgun builds have to get so close it's almost melee...  As a rifle user, I find it really frustrating.  I do rifle / melee... if I'm going to get close, I might as well be swinging :-D
---
Damn Stormcloaks
---
The fact they were rushed by their company to push something out does not really mean the devs suck.  They had a lot of people to please and a lot of pressure to release at the time they did.  NOW the company might suck, but so far they have suprised me with how they have been handling problems so far. Remember not too long ago how everyone was flipping out about the "duped item removal" and it turned out that in fact most of us were indeed not affected despite the 300000000 posts with 300000000000 upvotes claiming all sorts of doomsaying about how horrible it was going to be and how many innocents were  going to be affected.  Since that massive drama, I've completly stopped listening to the doom-sayers lol
---
I remember when I was willing to sell one of my Hunter's Long Coats for 1000 caps to a high level and then he messaged me saying it's overpriced and tried to attack me 
---
I think I’m missing the balloon plans and that’s it, then of course the maps. As for the wolves as long as the sloth is killed before one of the robots fall you’re good. I was in one last night where the wolves tore apart all the robots right after the sloth died and we still got the mask. 
---
Nope, seems good :-)
---
Just use normal rum, I think you have to be under the effect of alcohol. Fermented doesnt seem to count or last long enough. I had a similat issue trying to do one of the dailies where you had to take a pic while intoxicated.
---
Extremely different in some ways but very similar in other ways. Particularly the grind and RNG needed to get high level gear. 
---
Thus my question. We have two different BoS camps already in Appalachia, although I believe that most will break with Maxson on this until a better option is presented.
---
mine are _REALLY_ good at picking fights with scorchbeasts that are wayyyy out of range, atleast :P but mole rats and mongrels? not a chance :P
---
Survival mode only. 
---
So there isnt slap dmg and they can come up and wreck you with no consequence. 
---
Untill someone puts a 10k bounty to bankrupt them
---
Turrets are a very effective form of defense. If you try to play hunter/hunted and someone manages to get their camp up and running wherever they’re at, it makes it very difficult to get to them and put them down.  As it is right now for Griefers, all they have to do is destroy the turrets while in friendly mode and then they can easily start destroying the camp.
---
It was the catapult trap that launched us off the cliff in the direction of watoga that made the distance happen.. full burn at launch then just rapid button mashing to get jets to fire soon as they got ap kept height lvl constant
---
During the parade, I had a player ask me if I had any spare shotgun shells. I had a lot because a high level player way back when had gifted me a bunch before I switched to melee. I gave him 1k shotgun shells for free. After the event, another player was saying he needed plastic. The same player I gifted the shotgun shells gifted this other player some free bulked plastic.
---
There is a strong sense of paying it forward in this community and it really makes the game that much better. 
---
Clickbait for days...
---
No, it’s more that the devs have an additional goal behind their decisions.   So they’re more likely to pick the new way of doing things to see what happens.
---
It’s not that FO76 isn’t a game in its own right.  They’re just going to take riskier design decisions like slap damage instead of PVP servers/flagging.
---
Nope i tried to place it.
---
The problem I have is that the armour pieces in the stash take up most of the weight allowance. So how do you place a second or third or more on power armour frames. When I try to use two frames it just won't let me!!
---
I never said you said that. I explained how the event is structured, what a person could expect. I never quoted you, 
---
Sorry that you failed to understand what I said. 
---
I have only done this event three times lol 
---
I think we should not identify them as "the boys". They might just like the title of Mister but not the gender associated with it. We have to be more progressive.
---
Either find a server that doesn't have many people on it, or wait until someone nukes the prime site (most of the server will be over there for loot, ignoring you).
---
I've claimed exactly 1 workshop ever, just to see what happened.  Really no reason to do it again unless I want to try to farm plans of some sort.  There's plenty of other things to keep me busy.  And you'll find easier ways to farm materials with a little more experience, so there's really no need to worry about that.
---
In my opinion, fresh start would only prevent the inevitable. Sooner or later people would have their OP characters back and transfer the legendary equipment between them. Only time will tell what works better for the mode.
---
Yeah, the things are already in teh code to boot. Yoink 'em out of teh Vault and let us have a decent bathroom in peace! I mean, for Pete's sake, I just want a nice shower and a place to do my bidness.  
---
People. Iguana bits are People!
---
Yeah. Go back to jerking off and complaining about Half-Life 3, kiddos
---
I was only salty because it got nuked twice, when I had no access to power armor or even a hazmat suit
---
For some people. For others, the passion of their Fo76 life is helping them ignore the pain of a post surgical recovery life.
---
Exactly.  Bethesda is like "here's the mask you will get!" And then people play the mission 100 times and don't get them once. 
---
Yeah the story is really interesting its just not spoon fed to you 
---
dang
---
&gt; Seeing as this mode is brand new, a level playing field to means rolling up a new character and starting from scratch. 
---
... for about a week. At which point you're in the same un-level boat but you've both pissed off and fragmented the player base.
---
Good replies thanks! Still a little worrisome, but I hope it dosnt turning into dry dwelerless wasteland because everyone is capless and prefer adventure mode.
---
Survival?? What’s that I play on Xbox is this like a pc thing or am I blind af
---
Diluted Radaways remove one mutation at a time, right?
---
just did a 3 start super mutant horde. got 0 legendary items
---
I mean, I enjoyed the event, and I have not made any negative posts or comments about the event.  I have joined with others in wondering if the rare hats can drop and tried to help find out.  HOWEVER since you're directly assaulting the IDEAS in my head, I must now defend myself.  lol 
---
I WANT RARE COSMETIC ITEM DAMN IT!!!!!! /S-erious
---
I used the Lever two times. I worked. Just ft to WS and shot several enemies beforr getting sober
---
Well, you and I have traded before in the past, any interest in selling me a couple plans I'm missing?  I'm tired of that damn parade and the music is driving me insane... 
---
Sad but very true. 
---
Yeah, happened to me a little less than ten times in the last 3 days of running the event non-stop. I just keep at it. 
---
Really? I don't suppose you recorded your epic journey did you?
---
I did not fail to understand you.  You are justifying your opinion just like I am doing the same on mine and that's fine with me.  In either case, people have a right to be upset with the rare drop rates and the reddit poll is valid as it warranted a response from Bethesda.  That's really the only points I need to emphasize.  I do hope you have fun with the event though.  
---
I think you may have missed where I was going with that...
---
I'll add my 2 cents in. I'm pretty sure luck plays a part in the drop server side. When I'm low luck, get the witches and giants mask. 42 luck get soldiers mainly and some toothy man so I can see a pattern. The beret got 3 times in upper 30's. Giants and owl is common around 30-35. Tried a lot of different luck numbers. If I can get some luck bobbles can do 45 but that's my limit with the gear I currently have.  
---
Kind of burned out at the event. I did my cap run and biv last night, logged out. I'd be interested to see what guys at 45-48 get. I ran a lot at 41 and got a lot of toothy and a couple soldiers, easy to make awesome opossom for that.
---
Thats possible too
---
I have gotten two quests from BIV at the exact same time
---
Not Legendary, it was a level 30. 
---
Ok awesome I’m eager to hear your results. 
---
I've never had more than 3 but they don't even produce one for me since I hit 100.  I honestly miss it.  I actually had it occur two days ago when a couple of lower level characters were in the area. I believe I killed 13 that trip through the bog and I found it actually fun.  I still haven't found a way to drop my weight enough to fast travel and so I run everywhere stopping at the 5 small fissures in the bog on my way north every day and since I hit 100 most of the time the scorched beasts just fly on by leaving me to pilfer their Ultracite.  
---
This! The tattoos feel so out of place. They are all basically navy tattoos, and no one gets navy tattoos on their face. The only one thats any good is the throat stitch and that is a face paint. They need some gritty wastelandish face tattoos.
---
What the heck are you talking about? I (not you) saw it on a post about Fasnacht on r/gaming yesterday 
---
I would settle for them actually being more accurate, mine seem to be skewed from the actual direction, not a lot, but noticeable.
---
You are way too confident in Bethesda's ability to prevent future duplication exploits. All it takes is one new feature or code regression - which by the way has already happened multiple times - and your precious clean slate is ruined.
---
At that point there is no upside and only the downside of a fragmented player base.

Yes and I'm part of a large group doing the same.  Could use some help if it interested.  Great telling of you GP, and if the intent if the game. If course PVP is also part ih f that reality as it would be IRL.  Let's pray and hope that more if good is connected and passed as those looking for self gain are leaving some a bit raw. So thanks for the positive, I really appreciated the read.
---
Nope just quite a few screenshots and some pics with my phone, i wouldnt even know where or how to start recording to share it on ps4.
---
I need that mohawk
---
Do events. Don't worry about dying 
---
This game is designed for that, look at all the people bragging about their masks and their rare outfits all kinds of rare bits and bobs are taken and sold because of rarity, look at the Mr. Fuzzy outfit or the Whitesprings jumpsuit these outfits show dedication.
---
I completely agree, they're amazing!  They just need actual captions, it's kind of ridiculous that they just say, "(Radio Drama Plays)" the whole time.
---
I love that word! 
---
I have done the event about 15 times now. I don't care about the masks. The ones I got, I dropped in the road for others, along with some Nukashine. What I thought was fascinating was seeing all these people together. It's like they all came out of the woodwork. I never see these many people on the map at once, let alone in one place at the same time. I do think the event is too short-lived however. It starts and then it's done. Anticlimatic even.

fast travel spawn location for camp is based on your little overhead projector thingy.

Thanks dude! I’m only level 31, I just don’t have as many hours to play ( I also play anthem too, when it works right) so it’s great to play around higher levels players who understand the struggle of the little guys!
---
This game is designed for that, look at all the people bragging about all their cool outfits and weapons, all sorts of bits and bobs are sold for no other reason besides rarity, look at the Mr. Fuzzy outfit or the Whitespring jumpsuit, these outfits show dedication to this game.
---
Hey man, based upon recent Inside the Vaults, I'd say over the next couple weeks we will be told info on player vending, item displays, and the new camera. Just have patience, they have had a ITV about each feature released so far and doubt this will change.
---
I've done the event 4 times and never even noticed the sloth! That explains where everyone went today. I was rushed by oodles of wolves and bugs but everyone else had vanished. 
---
cool, while there may still be a few people bashing the game it is far less prevalent than it was a few months ago, and the literal one example you cite isn't even from this sub...  as I stated there is a bigger issue of people completely ignoring the many bugs this game has.
---
Exactly. One should also note that Taggerdy's chapter did not have the immunity to the scorched plague. So in a battle of attrition they would lose. But post-reclamation day the vault dwellers have the option to finding the vaccine and from there a war of attrition is possible. But the nuclear option still closes up the fissures and may be the smarter option if one is not willing to sacrifices numbers. I myself do break with Maxson. What is your opinion.  
---
Gaaary...
---
Yeah and I get the initial hate, but still hating it months in? Just move on to the next one already, just feels like an energy waste at this time
---
There are times when I think "man I really wish I could just straight up kill this person", but then I see someone in full pvp gear and i know how easily they can destroy a pve player like me in power armor, and I'm thankful that they can't lol.
---
Just came in here to say I upvoted this thread based on the name only.
---
Gotta say you're the only person who makes any sense on this post. It's a parade meant to bring gamers of all levels together and have fun first and foremost. If you want to grind go ahead but hell if you have the right to complain about drop rates.
---
if you wait until it meatpiles you can loot it, and if everyone leaves you can fast travel back to the location to make that happen faster. I have done this a few times. I also read that if you have "bloody mess" you can hit it a bunch of times and it will explode into meatpile, but I can't confirm that method.
---
I don't think you know what "in the field" means, there wouldn't be a clean bathroom in the field, that's why they appreciate it all the more when the return from field work.
---
That thing was my ace in the hole. Pretty much a guaranteed one shot. Doesn't work all that well on full pvp geared players though =(. But yeah, it's one of those ultra rare things that I'll probably always keep because it's rare.
---
I have nightmares that look like the bathrooms in most of Fallout.  \*\*shudder\*\*
---
I like how you had to edit your original comment about launch being "fucking amazing" because you knew it was bullshit. Lol 
---
I wasn't referring to this sub in the initial post, I was talking generally, just though people would have moves on by now if its such a failure, you know? 
---
I’d say that’s an exception 
---
The concrete barriers need to connect better to the ground to form a true perimeter.  They are about the only form of defense that can trump Marsupial at this point if I recall correctly.  They also need a powered door with keypad access piece to make it a viable form of defense/access.
---
[fidgets eagerly]
---
I've had the parade music stuck in my head for days and I've only done it 4x. I can't imagine 65x
---
I never said alcohol wasn't also bad, but that guy said not inhaling makes tobacco safer, and that is just not true.
---
Yup. Its more rediquette. Its not really the same in game. Its not a need to be liked, just how people communicate on reddit when you know most of the community disagrees with your opinion. It has to *appear* to be coming from sincere and wholesome view.
---
Gotta be polite and shill our playstyle as non aggressive. Nasty raiders get banned from here pretty quick. 
---
We can argue our points but because we are against the grain as far as opinions go, we know it and we are catering to the community standards. By having this attitude that screams "come on guys, were just playing the game too"
---
Plus its been my personal crusade to have this subreddit acknowledge raiders as a legit playstyle. It's not going so well.. Lol
---
Otherwise the mods ban us. Its just a reddit thing.
---
Thank You! I ended up finding it thanks to your advice, feeling kinda stupid now.
---
Seriously!
---
Yeah, to simply put it, there's no rush 
---
As long as it flags you for PvP if you do it anywhere besides within your own CAMP.
---
You can build a water purifier and a fusion generator, but you can't string some pipes together?
---
it's worse than Fallout 4 guys building on that engine, it's the guys from doom building on that engine.
---
They have no experience with it, and are dealing with it's insane limitations. I'm impressed they were able to do as much as they were before release, they shouldve pushed back its release date after the betas just so they could add and work on more, nobody is trashing Red Dead 2 because it got delayed so much, they are praising because it's good, and detailed, and the few hiccups it does have doesnt ruin the systems around that hiccup 
---
I’m a “higher” level (at 82) and I always take one shot then allow others to shoot. I learned to do this from the frustration I was having as a “high” level at 82 with 150-200+ leveled people killing in 2 shots. Life lesson: there is always someone bigger and better than you. 
---
Cmon. You’re saying Level 50’s are rocking pea shooters? You have some damn good weapons by level 50. 
---
It'd be nice to smoke all those cigerretes I find out in the world
---
Oh, woe. Some chud on Reddit has a negative number near his name. What a dreadful, unfair word we share. 
---
Does the SBQ not drop rare “junk?” So they just did that for caps? Even worse :P
---
Haha, Gary!
---
+karma 
---
did I fucking say it was a failure you ignorant fuck!  no, I didn't, in fact I said despite it's bugs people, myself included, still like the game, but to ignore the MANY bugs is fucking ignorant.  DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH, instead fucking READ and try comprehending my words before you word vomit some bullshit.
---
The thing is all of the things I mentioned, wouldn't be fixed with more time. The performance issues and bugs which turned a lot of people away would be fixed, but my point is there is a lack of experience in this game genre at this studio. I'm going to rephrase my statement, because the devs are definitely competent, they just don't know how to make an multiplayer open world rpg. But they are learning and doing a good job improving their product so I have faith they can improve.
---

---
You can get one from the Pumpkin House easily that's not related to this even in anyway. 
---
What. The. Fuck. Calm down babe
---
It's a good idea, I think the problem you run into is that this, to me, sounds more like a completely separate game set in the fallout universe, as opposed to an extension of FO76.  I think for your ideas to really succeed you would need more players on each server, and if Bethesda did not up the player cap I think an idea like this, while awesome on paper, may fall flat in terms of execution.    
---
Obviously the roadmap says some sort of faction system is coming in the fall,,,,but I would be surprised if it is as robust as this concept.     
---
I will send you a friend request when I get home from work it will have fatguy in the name. I should have enough bulk lead to craft 3-5k rounds. What level are you.
---
kill yourself
---
If you are on Xbox I have an extra Cappy jacket free to a good home.
---
Good to know, I've had this happen 2 of 5 times I've ran the event.
---
Really? this guy did like a 2 hour video just talking about that theory lol - I forget who it was, came up in my video suggestions on youtube.
---
I also break with Maxson, he doesn't know what we know, and not breaking with Maxson sooner ended Taggerdy's Thunder.
---
49
---
I’m not sure yet how that will work.  Teams wasn’t a discussion point for the new servers, IIRC.
---
Only real use other than alum and lead is that you can sell it to vendors for caps.  Most junk can't be sold to vendors unless it has been bulked.  And yes be careful not to unbulk it by auto scraping your junk or you will just unbulk your newly bulked items.
---
Hi jims1973. Thanks so much for the help. Just got up before 5am to try and join you. Looking for Healing Factor. Just have to check my materials...
---
I just want some hair that's longer than shoulder length.
---
This would be amazing. 😍
---
I got you. 
---
the road to hell is paved with good common fasnacht masks.
---
Oh, that's perfect! I had no idea that existed, thanks
---
I hoard them all on a mule char in anticipation for the legendary vendor. Other than that most of them are trash
---
pull Todd Howard's cock out of your mouth and then we can talk.
---
I had the same issue, would always see the plans with the Watoga Brotherhood bot but then when I had enough caps I could never find them. Finally found them with Grahm, though it is not a guarantee he will have them every time and his inventory is different for each player.
---
If PvP servers tried to group players by level (1-10 ,2-20, etc.) It would be slightly more fair (but still not a level playing field by any stretch of the imagination.) 
---
Watching my hits on the enemies health bar would argue that point. By hit 2 its doing quite well.
---
You're just keeping this going for the sake of arguing. I'm done. There is nothing wrong with data mining. If people didn't do that, we wouldn't know about the stealth nerfs and such that have happened. End of story.
---
Not a problem! I'm so glad I was introduced to this myself! 
---
Wait for them to be prepared 
---
It was truly one of my most fun experiences in the game so far since it put pretty much every player on the map playing together.  We definitely need more of this.  My biggest gripe is that the game has been out for a while now and I wish that we had some type of raid event that got everyone working together.  It seems like the game is headed in the right direction overall though.
---
You wait. It runs once an hour. Go do other things and check your map frequently. 
---
The perimeter defense pieces need work too. The camp system is woefully prepared for defense
---
Strong advice
---
Bethesda knew about duping and let it happen for months before they did anything about it, and let most people off the hook to prevent collateral damage. Now they're actually punishing people who continue trying to dupe. Now they have the tools in place to do something about it. Unless they handle it as poorly as they did the first time, any future duping won't even come close to having the effect this first iteration did
---
This makes a TON of sense; great tip! I've just started to notice that this can happen. Did you end up restarting the level 27? I've thought about rolling with another character now that I've got the hang of things and am not just winging it.
---
It starts automatically...once an hour I think?  Just wait, it will start eventually. 
---
yeah perhaps true.  I think the open world survival genre in general is still....lacking.  There have been major flaws in pretty much all of them, and most of the ones on the market today have local save files that are easily edited/exploited.  So I dunno, it's still a bit of an experiment to get it "right".  You have to predict the unpredictable, human nature :P  Unfortunately, it's often safer to just kill the guy walking by before he sees you, than to chance it and risk making a friend.  So full on survival is hard to make it appeal to people, and even harder to make it work.  Anyway, we will see :P
---
If you want, I can make you a build just tell me what style you want to play
---
I literally saved a rolling pin with vampiric and swing speed just in case this exact update came 
---
Which ones do you need and what would you pay for them? I can probably raise prices on these once the event closes so at least my time wont be 100% wasted. 
---
I've probably done close to 50.  I'm about done, since after 50 your odds of getting even 1 of the rare masks is a little over 1%.
---
The event is available again an hour after the last event started on any particular server.  Hopping servers will increase your odds, but it's not guaranteed.  Also, you'll generally find a lot more groups doing them during peak hours, so save up your play time for then.
---
The concrete walls are the only thing of value in a PVP environment.  Everything else is a carryover from Fallout 4 and not ever remotely realistic for actual defense.
---
Sausages do unfortunately.
---
You’ve provided such amazing thoughts and ideas, it’s hard to counter any of them.
---
Yes!  Tub, shower, toilet, sink, soap dish, and towel hanger.  All clean.  
---
Oooh, I'll keep an eye out for those weapons -- like the Medic effect from FO4 but way more useful. I wonder if it stacks with the Friendly Fire perk, where your burn damage heals allies.
---
They did mention somewhere that any players in your party or on your team wouldnt be marked as hostile for you.
---
Oh I once built a glitched camp that was inaccessible if you did not know the ridiculous glitched foundation stairs path needed to get to the enterance. Security is something I've been extensively researching but barely use besides experimenting. My current base has it all both hidden from monsters and exposed to players.
---
Did you make this adorable picture??
---
Wasn't the indistructable camps only in adventure? I don't mind about that.
---
I don't mind the survival scoreboard. 
---
The part I don't like is the part where top 3 living time players will show up on the map.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/wDVGwMt.png](https://i.imgur.com/wDVGwMt.png)
---
***Soon***.
---
It will show up like other events on your screen and will tell you to first talking to the mister handy on the bridge then will have you find five protectrons and do thier missions before you start the parade . 
---
Yes, I'm sick of taking my chems in a filthy bathroom stall.
---
I am willing to pay 9K for a TSE weapon. More exactly for a Handmade. Anyone selling on PC?
---
Lung cancer 
---
Mh sry, "Riverside manor", where you start the questline. Up north by the riverbed with a slope leading up the wall.  Been near beckley befire that but moved so i could reach uranium fever and the whitespring plus raider traders easyer.
---
I would love this.  There are times that I don't care about the workshop after claiming it and would be completely OK with giving ownership to someone else without having to be hostile to them.
---
when you finish turning in the steins and the robot gos to leave the final report will be on the printer next to him 
---
Thank you, I see some don't like what I've said. Oh well. Hopefully the next "big event" won't be this disappointing.
---
Like Batman, Godzilla leaves his meat all over town 
---
What I dislike about the event is how stupid easy it is. The line in the sand and heart of the swamp events, events that were present since launch, are much more challenging and entertaining. I can literally punch all enemies in the parade to death as a high level. Considering this is NEW content, it should be catered to people who are done with all other content, instead of new players who still haven't finished the main quest-line. Also, making something challenging would create a greater sense of teamwork, even for low-levels and it would be an accomplishment for them to complete a very challenging event (Much better than sleeping through a 15min event and waking up for a reward).
---
Maybe only select containter type allow for the option. For the pharma perk its only dcotor bags chem boxes or firat aid boxes
---
Personally, I see not accidentally drinking from the toilet while scavenging a big upgrade already.
---
There are special “cap stash” boxes around the world. Those are the only containers with caps and those are the only ones you can search for extra 
---
There are glitches that allow you to make a structure out of foundations, which are indestructible. There are also ways to glitch inside of impervious world structures using crafting elements. Once inside you're invulnerable. The number one survivals stat Beth has mentioned is survival time.
---
*whispers 'rare mask'*
---
Oh I have nothing against creating toons personally. If they would release two survival modes, one interchangable with adventure, and one hardcore - fresh start or regular wipes - I would play the hardcore version.
---
My point and my agenda is that I want more people to be ready to enter and enjoy survival mode so I'd have broad spectrum of opponents. What I support brings me disadvantages. Separating the toons would give me advantage.
---
What is your play style?
---
There are many primate builds out there that have been used by lots of people and thoes people tweak them to suit there needs.
---
If you have a specific play style you wish to use people can help you by making a build catered to you. And from there you just follow it and if you don't like a sort of it just swap it out for something new.
---
You can get liver cancer from drinking as well.
---
Are you looting cap stashes? It only works on cap stashes!
---
with animal friend you are able to tame: brahmin, cat, deathclaw, rabbit, radrat, hound, fox, frog, megasloth, mirelurk (hunter,king,queen,spawn), mole rat, wolf, opossum, owl (never seen one but they evidently exist), beaver, chicken, squirrel, radstag, radtoad, attack dog, scorchbeast, wild mongrel, yao guai, sheepsquatch.
---
with wasteland whisperer you can tame:  snallygaster, honey beast, mole miner, wendigo, super mutant(what), deathclaw, mirelurk, bloodbug, bloatfly, radroach, stingwing, radscorpion (previous comment makes sense now), mirelurk hunter, feral ghoul, fev hound(what), glowing one, behemoth, non feral ghoul (EVEN MORE WHAT), angler, hermit crab, gulper, small gulper (i don't know the difference?), cave crickets, ants, an unused race called quantum deathclaw, tick, firefly, sheepsquatch, mirelurk spawn, and an unused ghoul super mutant race.
---
Source: I'm a dataminer and these are the races allowed. there is no condition for having only 1 spawn or having it be a totally random spawn. guaranteed spawns as long as they are not event driven are also eligible as well as glowing/diseased/legendary and other types.
---
I regularly stock the Overseer's camp locker with disease cures, dog food, and ammo of all calibers.  That's where I dump dupe plans as well.
---
Not beyond adding a nice little arrow to indicate my location.  I have to credit the folks at West Virginia Tourism for the main image.
---
No worries, im not on either. Ill add and message you a bit later and see if youre on. If anything ill just hop on for 5 min to hook you up 👍👌
---
There are plenty of prizes that make it worth it. But the coolest half of the masks aren't dropping which kind of sucks!
---
Sarcasm is a hard thing for you isnt it?
---
Liver Disease.  Do people seriously think alchohol is safe? FUCK you can die from drinking too much you cant die from being too high!
---
It will be out next thursday or how is spelled day after monday (lol).
---
Ppl complain about things that are not even out.
---
Leveling to 50 is fast.  Getting max level good tier weapons and armor takes a very long time.  Not to mention superstim packs and other aids.  Also you probably don’t have all the perk cards you want at L50 so lose out on damage.  Unless the L300 person is a complete idiot it will be a lopsided advantage.
---
I may not have trashed my cappy jacket and jeans on PC if you want them (the damned cuffed jeans just ruin it for me). IGN same as reddit sans underscores.
---
Yawn. 
---
People are going g to complain. Going on a rant and reiterating what they’re saying may get you gold, but it doesn’t make you “right”
---
Maybe you should just let people play the game as they wish? Yeah. 
---
Yeah i read alot about that already. 
---
Explore the game, learn as you go, trial and error.  I find following too many guides lessens my enjoyment of the game.
---
In sign language: 
---
*rare mask*
---
Suggestion: film-set mode; build CAMPs as sets, no PVP, posable/animated NPC creatures and bots as extras, floating lighting options, moving camera rails, day/night/weather toggling etc.
---
 I do the opposite. I got a big ass castle in a high traffic area. Please come fight at my cadtle, tear it down. Ive got thousands of steel/wood
---
Thanks, sounds good.
---
What’s crazy is up until earlier this morning the sloth never dropped loot for me. 
---
Look. Everyone who did the event multiple times is getting the same exact 5. I do not know all the rare ones off of my head but a few are the jester and old man winter.
---
Or someone nuked the area sometime prior, then level 60 scorched conquerors, higher level rad roads, and higher level super mutants spawn.
---
I can make T60 jet packs and calibrated shocks.  I'm on pc. Don't have mat list handy.
---
I've had trouble since the patch, but that may be because I don't equip it until I see a cap stash. I don't interact with it, but still - no "Search" option given when I try to interact with it.
---
Ooops, catually snowflakes are people who whining about char transfer. This people scared, not me.
---
I'm ready to play in PVP and i'm ready to die from hands of some overpowered guy. This is better to me than start game from zero again.
---
Does that apply to letting people post what they want? I mean that’s your whole point isn’t? 
---
Infrequent mask 
---
I be quiet. When he leave...I be talking again!
---
Yea, once i realized i could pick a different card from the stat i just increased, i just restarted. I also had a good idea of what i wanted my base stats to be by the time i hit level 50. Worked out well. Im happy enough that i wont ever change my base stats, though i wish i had 5-10 that i could add. Just a few more wanted in CHA, END, and LCK haha
---
I fully expected something creepier and grittier from what I read. I think i found a note or tape that mention the programming or the parade bots being sketchy or not holding up. I thought we were going to discover the robots took over the town and we have to fight them to get it back or something. Misinterpretation I guess. 
---
Thelania is just cleaning up your poor format.
---
Nice. I’m not looking personally to get those made, but if you have extra plans to learn them, I’d be happy to take/buy them. 
---
I don't have extra plans for them sorry.  
---
Just played the event again. Popped every balloon I could find and didn't got any enemies. Lost one robot. Awarded with Toothy &amp; Old Man Winter. I'm sure there were some balloons down in the creek. Gonna try it again. 
---
Well look at this. Responders and raiders finally getting along....
---
*Gimme junk and stimpaks or ill break your decon shower*
---
So we're going totally Star-bellied sneetches, where the bumblebees and schoolbuses become gray and blue, while ultracite turns into a crash test dummy.  To each his own, I suppose.
---
That seriously crossed my mind too. Like someone got payed to design these and now no one gets to even see someone else wearing one, let alone themselves 
---
I especially don't get the hate against top of the leaderboard visibility thing. Pvp is  the main part of survival. And encouraging it with giving people rewards for killing longest life players is a good move. If you want to avoid pvp  just go play adventure, like me.
---
The character lock suggestions I see is too early as well I think. People just might not want to start over to play the pvp mode. This way the pvp servers are populated enough.
---
+1 for Friday reference. 
---
Zihuatanejo?
---
You are a drop in the sea of cries for this to happen.
---
Yep.  Only event I've failed was because some level 60-ish suicide bombers showed up and surprised the few of us that were actually paying attention.
---
Funny thing is, I don't think the rad toads were higher level, thought it's hard to tell sometimes with all the firepower that was showing up the first day.
---
&gt;I do not know all the rare ones off of my head...
---
That's fine, I was just trying to get a better idea of what exactly the rare ones are.
---
I've had pharma work on supply drops if there is already a med or chem in it when unlocking it.
---
I miss that spot. I had a house for a while on the hill with a copper extractor there. My camp was just east of the 87 on the map by summersville. Super mutants for days! 
---
That being said, further south than that and youll run a higher chance of scorched beasts flying around. It was extremely rare for me to see them at my house. A higher level would spawn higher mutants but nothing too bad. I can't imagine why you'd be getting swarms of them there. You are pretty close to the savage divide though, so it could be some sort of spillover.
---
Do you remember what time by chance?

Yesterday around like 7 maybe at Fasnacht event

I Tesla the hell out of the event. I can one shot a suicider which is convenient.

Your girl will be fantasizing about the wonderful man who took off his dress for her ;)
---
Irony:noun
---
 a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result. 
---
That sounds coo, Id love to see it, PC?
---
No problem. 
---
It's a bug sometimes if you die when encumbered.
---
And 10 stimpacks later they’ve still got a win.
---
I am so tired of these posts. 
---
Yeah, in Fallout 4 folks have to actually mod the base player skin to get arm tattoos. Though if I recall correctly, there was a complicated way of giving the player a different base body than other characters. If Bethesda continues to take inspiration from what successful modders have done, we *may* see more body customization at some point!
---
These posts are tired of you too. 
---
“...the part of the fanbase that matters.” This is exactly what I am talking about you conceited idiot.
---
Just like the rest of us
---
Sorry. Your right.
---
I ran with a muzzle braked 2 shot assault rifle for a while and I agree the recoil is extremely mild. Fire rate wasn’t anything outstanding though. 
---
Were you over encumbered? In a rare circumstance, after dying, I only had the option to respawn at Vault 76. If that doesn't work, I'm thinking a server hop may be the only solution. 
---

---
This happens with every cap stash I check with cap collector 3, if you check the stash then walk away a few feet then walk back to it the search option will then show up, if you have fortune finder equipped a good distance to walk away before returning to it  is the distance it takes not to hear the pinging, it’s been like that for me for what feels like eternity now lol
---
And with vendors!
---
I'm torn between upvoting and reporting this post, good job
---
Well said, I was totally dismayed by the event after 3 attempts at it not because of the event but because of the players.
---
My first try I got the Owl mask and was very happy with it, the second one had only 1 robot survive and the third failed. The last 2 attempts went south very quickly as high level players that were not even helping the parade along its path but instead were waiting for the Sloth left the moment a Robot went down.
---
It's people like this that make gaming crap and I wish them the worst in life if this is the attitude they take into life as well.
---
I got this too. The attackers spawned as Anglers.
---
I'll have to farm a bit of coal (didn't even know it existed in the game till yesterday), but otherwise I have everything else except enough of one or two flux that I'm short one or two (I'll have to double check again which ones, though I'm pretty sure I'm good on violet). I'll be on a bit later as I'm at work, but I'll be free tomorrow if that works better for you? 
---
That's not bad ass at all. That's just awful, that's like hey let's take the most used PA (excavator) and the least (ultracite) and have them swap paint jobs.
---
Personally - I am looking for the Dog Food manufacturing plant since I seem to find that everywhere.
---
This subreddit is ignorant to the opinions of the pvp community. 
---
The pvp community isnt represented here as the pve community deemed them "toxic".
---
Imo its the jedi who are evil. PvE players are toxic carebears here on reddit.
---
I’m not feeling threatened, I’m feeling annoyed by the sheer amount of people in here who think they are the center of the f076 community.
---
Get. Help. People like you are voting and that's scary. 
---
Starched Gene's perk
---
I hope we can get pics off the PS4 easier.......
---
Looks good 
---
Hell yeah my man, we need more nice people out there. I’m on my 5th character right now with over 700 hours and you would not believe how many people I meet that need help. I’ve gotten roughly everything I want in this game, but nothing makes me feel better than helping out someone else and getting that heart emote. I stopped doing quests long ago and take over a bunch of workshops, and after every 1-1.5 hours pick everything up and drop it in front of vault 76. You should hear some of the people when their first experience is being handed plans and junk by a half naked man (no pun intended) 
---
This is the only thing I'm doing in the game right now and I have to be honest it is a really fun event bringing the whole server together for a common goal but the drop rate is so stupid the event takes to long to reset so you have no choice but to keep server hopping just to increase your odds of getting something good
---
I have collected so many of the same mask but I think the odds should have been set different I'm working so hard right now just to try and get at least one rare mask but with such a short time period in the event I'm sure I will never get one
---
Well done Bethesda for ruining what could have been a great event and forgetting only a small minority of players have no real world commitments and can play day and night to get the game to work
---
You can sit in the porta potty. It’s fairly clean for a portapotty 
---
I actually just had this happen. It only counted down 1 out of the 3 blast zones on the map
---
Ok so it has been a month since me being banned. Finally let me login. But now I don’t give a shi*!!! They never sent an email saying my account is unlocked like they said they would in the email. They never responded to ANY of my tickets I sent In disputing my locked account. I am still mad because I never duped anything, never exploited weight glitches or xp boosts. I never got any emails from them except telling me I’m locked out of my account.  Because the “game data” shows I duped weapons. Once again I don’t even know how to do that. I only saw one person in my friends list whom also got banned. And I know some of them were dupers. No apology... nothing. They wouldn’t even respond to my emails. All I wrote was that they made a mistake and not to take my word for it just simply look at my item history or account. Just look!!! They didn’t. They didn’t do anything. Anything at all. F*ck Bethesda f*ck them up their stupid asses!!!! I’ve always loved every game they made including 76. No more!!
---
While your advice might generally work, OP is right. I once found Phoenix clear out in the fields outside Watoga, due Northwest, past the water and trenches, fighting absolutely nothing, and making no effort to walk back.
---
My husband and I looked everywhere for an hour, gave up, left, and found him by accident. It was infuriating. There’s no reason to let him attack and wander like that.
---
No problem. Though I am out of coal at the moment. 
---
I can pick that up. Can get on around 6pm est
---
There's an Endurance(I think) card perk that prevents Rad-Away from removing mutations
---
Oh no really????? Lmao
---
you're not crazy. this has been happening for me as well. I thought maybe they switched it so that you couldn't just activate the perk when you were two feet away, but I would enable it then fast travel to a new location and it still wouldn't show the y button option. I figured it was just broken now and I don't bother.
---
Sounds good I'll be on all day 
---
you bet.
---
I can be on tonight around 6pm mst if you want to pm me your username!
---
no problem!
---
Also this event goes on for a long span of time. I'm guessing they'll spread it out evenly or blah blah blah. 
---
It'd be cool to see a party where the majority of players march weapon-less with the robots 
---
Is that an issue on PS4? Game DVR and capture on Xbox works perfectly, quickly and easily shared to OneDrive so I can pick up and edit offline. Didn’t know PS4 had any limitations in that regard
---
Starched Gene (Luck), Class Freak (Luck), Stranger in Numbers (CHA) a great combo for mutations

Youtube jug
---
It's only until next week, that's not a long span of time.
---
I would like to get some of those other masks. Beth has heard and will make them more obtainable at some point. It's not rocket appliances. Just enjoy the event tho, or don't do it at all.
---
By the sound of it, you've played other survival games :) Most people claiming that a fresh start is optimal simply have not played other survival games like ark or rust. I still think the optimal scenario is keep levels intact but separating inventory between the two modes.
---
It is reminiscent of the prototype X-01 with a little BOS flair
---
I thought the "To whoever..." posts would be done for FO76 by now...
---
Sure man.  I’ll hold it for you.  
---
&gt; Bethesda knew about duping and let it happen for months before they did anything about it
---
Exactly, the first method was published on YouTube during BETA and required nothing more than two players and an artillery CAMP item. It persisted for weeks when this kind of issue in another online game would have warranted taking the servers down, patching and rolling back all progress. That would even have been very justifiable during the BETA test.
---
&gt; Unless they handle it as poorly as they did the first time
---
Bethesda has not yet earned any trust in this regard. 
---
Weird, every parade I've been in, the high-level players have been handling the wolves so others can tag the sloth.
---
After like 8-10 runs on the event I can say I have found decent rewards, nothing fancy and duplicates of masks but it's still fun to do and work with other player, made a few friends thru the event.
---
Onky ONE time there was a douche who went straight ti the spawn spot of the sloth after the Super Mutants and one shoted the sloth (not cool!)
---
The other high lvl players I saw, punched that thing unarmed and backed away to let everyone get a shot
---
What I like the most about it is interacting with other people, on one run we all coordinated who was doing what and was so quick and easy, we all felt so accomplished by working together
---
This event is about that, bringing people together
---
Until you can get the starched genes perk, get a brahmin pen and drink lotsa milk. (Or hang around Flatwoods milking the public brahmin). It reduces rads without taking away mutations.
---
Is the owl rare? I got two. One for me, the other for someone i met that wanted to buy my first one. It will be free.
---
So you can indiscriminately kill people who aren’t engaged in pvp and not be wanted?
---
all we know is what was in the roadmap regarding stars and mechanics:
---
&gt;Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your choice.
---
So what about these indestructible foundation bases everybody's building?
---
It's the battlefront 2 of 2018.  Some really bad pr around launch made it hated by every capital G gamer around, and fallout fans already hated it, so it was like a perfect storm of angry boys.  Personally I'm glad, let bandwagoners hate the game and not play it, community's great without them.
---
Class freak is probably a must inless you want to buy serums or spend a ton of time trying to get the perfect mutation combo also I feel like blocker isn’t very useful I use portable pharmacy instead because I carry a ton of chems 
---
Can you still glitch through certain windows? I stopped using them when I ran into a stranger in my house who glitched through a window.
---
Well said
---
Donut recipe?
---
&gt; expensive  
---
If you're willing to pay for an expensive solution, you can already RadAway your mutations until you lose the correct one and re-purchase the serums. Players sell them for around 500 caps.
---
There are effectively 17 mutations so the potential cost is 500-8500 caps depending how (un)lucky you are and how willing you are to roll RNG to re-acquire some of your mutations via radiation first.
---
Yeah!! After all of the "there's no NPCs, just note scraps" hate, I wasn't expecting the stories and tapes to be so... chilling. I keep stumbling upon audio narratives that keep me enraptured. 
---
I also like that I can listen and continue to play, come back to stories later, and the voice acting isn't constrained by the limits of the virtual actor and dialogue tree budgets.
---
No one knows really. I’ll be surprised if you can exchange multiple 1 stars for a 3 star. 1 stars are fairly common as far as legendaries go. 
---
*Fallout 76 has joined The Elder Scrolls universe* 
---
Bethesda: wait wut
---
1. Nothing suggests otherwise
---
2. Datamined files indicate so
---
3. Two times the caps lost two times the reward given
---
4. and 6. Solved by 3.
---
5. Nothing suggests otherwise
---
7. and 8. Nothing
---
9. New bounty system will allow any attacked (killed?) player to place a bounty. I believe its reasonable to assume manual bounty placing upon attack on camp
---
10. Unclear, setting this up via terminal seems best solution
---
11. and 12. and 13. Still seems unclear
---
14. Nothing suggests otherwise, be smart
---
15. Current game design strongly suggest so
---
Further questions are more of an expression of opinion than questions. Allow me to disagree with these opinions and refrain from answering them. Have a nice day.
---
1. I don't own any of these sub
---
2. I never ask anyone to dislike your comment.  
---
I know the fact that whatever I say you still won't trust me and I respect your opinion. Just want to let you know... I'm not here for a fight, I'm here to share the joy of simply enjoying a game.
---
According to the info Bethesda put out i can only see it being one of 3 things or a mix of all.
---
1. Item for item exchange. so a 1 star item will swap for a 1 star item, 2 star for 2 star etc
---
2. Grants the ability to finally scrap legendary items and potentially get some good junk.
---
3. Will buy legendary items for more caps and also sell legendary items.
---
I would bet top money that it will be a mix of all 3. 
---
Bethesda stated on their roadmap that you can exchange, scrap and get legendary gear so I am currently saving all legendary gear regardless of how many stars just incase.
---
I also Buy and Sell from my shop next to Whitesprings station too. 
---
Sounds fine to me. 
---
That’s what I ended up doing. Thanks!
---
That would explain a lot...thanks!
---
This comment is from 4 hours ago on a thread over a day old??? lmao 
---
Are you still on about this? Jesus christ man, get off Reddit and get a life. 
---
This is yesterday shit. I don't even care anymore because I have other things going on in my life besides some shit going on in a game.
---
As far as i'm concerned this conversation is over.  
---
I just did one with two low level players and myself and they handled the wolves like pro's, I was very impressed (and waited for them to tag the sloth too.) No bots died either, it was a good run.
---
Unusual face cover
---
Are you wearing Power Armor? Cause the Power Armor compass has been broken for as long as I've seen it in Fallout 76.
---
Barely, for Ark you get a certain level and you're able to craft anything and have an even playing field with others. On Fallout the RNG is much more needed for gear and not having certain things on there against people with them would just be a horrible experience for people who are just coming to the game. Such as gear and even mutations. People have to realize this is basically an MMO. This is how pvp on most MMOs work, your character you've been playing with all along will be able to participate in pvp if they wish. 
---
(If people are worried about the dupers having crazy gear just simply don't play until you know Bethesda has fixed that issue, or do what I do and just farm pvp gear.)
---
If people really wanna sit in a glitched area and do nothing just so they can be on the top of a scoreboard then I will let them. I’ll be busy playing the game and having fun. 
---
The event drops a recipe for one.
---
To be honest,  I love these kinds of bugs. I take pictures in photo mode every time I  find one I haven't seen before.
---
There's a bug that freezes enemies sometimes that I also like to see.  I will try and find ways to get close up photos with the monster and the background that look great or I'll pose next to them and take a photo. This seems to happen most with ghouls.
---
I heard if you get 12 stars on your pokemon trainer card, you can get a ticket that allows you to take a rocket to the moon. Once there you fight Jirachi and once you catch him there's a 0.03% chance he'll be holding a rare Fasnacht mask.
---
It's super rare. Apparently only 5 are actually allowed to exist in the game at any time.
---
I dunno, what's fair?  Mainly I'm looking for the donut recipe and the bonfire plan.  If you have a bunch of spares, would you take 500 caps for those two?  What are you looking for on those
---
None of the duped items stack either. Duper’s are doubling everything they have in a very small amount of time. A duper could produce what a hoarder hoards in 1 month, in 1 night. There’s a significant difference there, if you can’t see it, maybe open your eyes.
---
But the original guy did, his video is around here somewhere.
---
I don't know if people have said this, but I can recall similar outrages when Oblivion and Skyrim first launched. Bethesda's games tend to launch with hitches by the very nature of what they create: a massive open world with very few guard rails on what the player can do. It's impossible for them to internally test every variable, so the first few launch weeks end up being a mass beta test.
---
Which sucks. But time passes, they smooth out the worst bugs, introduce new content and patches, and the games start to shine.
---
I’m on now for the next couple hours if you’re available.
---
Go into Social and respawn on a teammate or team invite everyone in Recent if you're solo. It's worked for me on xb1 at least if I'm remembering correctly. 
---
I’ve always been relatively a use anything I find mainly focusing on rifles but in my time and experience playing I’ve found out that melee is super good in this game so I’d like to try to have a melee build but not horrible at using weapons when necessary 
---
GAH I want an owl mask so bad! I keep getting Toothy.
---
Yes and No. If they understand the overly complex rules around engaging PvP... They cane easily avoid being killed. Slap dmg takes over a minute to kill someone with.
---
You gotta trick them into accepting the PvP engagement. Slap them then step infront of a bullet, tag a wotkshop they own, take advantage of a mutation that they have, destroy their camp to get them to shoot at you...
---
Pacifist mode and knowledge of how PvP initiates are your best friends if you wanna avoid PvP.
---
Thank you for the advice !
---
Yeah, but you're calling it a pattern so I was confused. Regardless, I can hop on tonight and just drop one for you. 
---
Groovy, thanks. Apologies for the bluntness, too many supposedlys and apparentlys in one sitting was making me grumpy. I did actually come across that on twitter earlier so that's 2 confirmed drops in 3 days. Not great really for a week long event.
---
I haven't put nearly as much hours in any other game as I put in FOnline which is an old unofficial fallout game with no PvP restrictions and full loot drop.
---
Fresh start can be cool experience. I love wipes. Just quit (not you personally, its just a figure of speech) the level the playing field if you want it to be done once, its bullshit if its not regular seasonal thing.
---
I kept it muted. All I did qas server hop and turn in wood if the lumberjack was there as my "contribution." Then , I'd go take a seat and wait to see what I got.
---
Well I want to create a new play style and focus on melee weapons , but thank you for the advice ! 
---
Not here. Pc
---
Ooo thx for the info I'll update 
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
Wait, the shower in the mine actually works? Never found a way to activate it, just used Enclave.
---
Ah, different one, ok.
---
I've seen 4 people, adults whining about not getting a mask like a 3 year old in the toy at walmart who's momma said no to buying a toy. It was hilarious
---
Did this happen last night by any chance?
---
The PS4 controller has a share button that when pressed will give you the option to share/save the last 15 minutes of gameplay. 
---
Both me and my SO (on the same LAN) has intermittent disconnects from the Fallout servers on PC.
---
The game first says "controls has been temporally disabled" and then a short while after we disconnect. Not both of us at the same but rather it seems completely random and we can't figure out what is wrong.
---
Every time we disconnect we loose the latest stuff we've found, like if I find and read a recipe or plan I didn't have and then disconnect when I come back I don't have it in my inventory and I haven't learned it either. If doing a daily quest and disconnecting the daily dissapears and can't be taken again that day.
---
This is extremely frustrating and we can't seem to figure out what is wrong.
---
If anyone has any ideas I am all ears.
---
Til
---
How is taking 45% less damage at maximum level less useful than carrying more chems? 45% is a huge reduction in damage, especially for people who are going to be within melee range 100% of the time!
---
If you do not need to heal as often, you do not need to carry all those chems.
---
Always pick blocker.
---
More of a flash fern, really.
---
Melee or heavy weapons or sneak
---
Hell just give a description next to it to help out.
---
Side note my excavator PA is named "Power Armor Chassis (2)" so it makes it easy to differentiate between my sets.
---
Did not know that will have to try it.
---
Thx man 
---
It’s alright, Ye I must agree saw a lot of ppl saying they’ve gotten the old man winter as well but no solid proof, and yes so far those are the only concrete confirmed drops out of all people right now which isn’t the greatest for a limited time event apparently like a 0.03% drop rate 
---
/side-eyes Biv
---
...he's not wrong.
---
itd make simple things like voting for what you want in the game overly complicated for no reason
---
I saw him once . On the river road just north of the race track.
---
Instigating is fun
---
What platform?
---
I understand all of that. What I’m saying is that at least one person (me) was killed multiple times by “slap” damage from what we’ve pieced together as probably being a bloodied build TSE handmade before I ever fired back. I have no perks or armor that causes reflected slap damage. I didn’t shoot back (bc one shotted) and the aggressor still had no wanted tag. 
---
If I had fired back, I would understand why he wasn’t wanted. That makes sense. 
---
Killing me multiple times with no retaliation whatsoever on my part without getting tagged doesn’t make sense to me or to other people in the thread.
---
If you use a stealth boy while crafting/repairing are you still invisible and do you still have to crouch when using a stealth boy?
---
Long Pig
---
You might be thinking of the skeleton mask you get at the pumpkin house. The plan spawns randomly as well so you can craft it.
---
Xbox, apologies, edited the post 
---
Maybe stealth commando for DPS 
---
It seems like what is common and rare etc. differs from player to player. I almost always get witch, or toothy. ( i leave those in brown bags) I have seen other players who say they always get soldier , owl or Giant. Yesterday I finally got a Giant, and then took an owl from a brown paper bag. I see some think that the luck stat plays a part, but I have been using the same gear from the get. (i did switch to exc pa, for weight reasons) I think "Working as intended" means that we are spending lots of time grinding these masks, that we will likely toss when our stash is full. lol
---
I've found him next to the crashed plane up north. Didn't know he was rare and just thought that was his permanent spawn with the new update. 
---
Just scrub with Abraxo.  
---
There's a mod to fix that.
---
I found him today at the front of the house, by Relay Tower EM-B1-27 in flatwoods.
---
Alternatively, 
---
How can i mute it without muting sfx? I wish it was tied to the radio volume tab so i can get the torturous music away from my brain. 
---
BAMBADOMBOM BOM BAB BOM BA  BAMDAMBOMBODUM DUM DIMD DUM
---
NOOOOOOOOOOO MOOOOORRREEE
---
I was always wondering what purpose the insult bot serves in this game other than 1 steel and 2 lead.
---
Not very common Headwear
---
I appreciate the offer. Just traded for one a bit ago though. Very nice of you though!
---
There is a big red button on the wall, on both ends of the showers. You take a little bit of damage though, so don't use it at one HP :)
---
Depends on your purpose. AAE is used often for pvp. It's reasonable for pve as well, but bloodied builds blow it out of the water (due to nerd rage, adrenal reaction mutation, and bloodied all stacking and doing max damage at 19% HP). For pure damage, probably bloodied swing speed meathook with an unyielding set is the highest dps, so I guess you could go with AA + swing speed meathook. 
---
IMO you're losing so much damage in pve by not going bloodied, and the downsides are very minimal with the right gear and build. 
---
On Xbox but I just got one anyways. Very generous offer. Thank you!
---
Main difference is no slap damage. Just full damage all the time between characters. 
---
Idk what faction a flannel shirt and jeans combo bought from the item shop belong too. I don’t think it has stat bonuses either.
---
If I just wanna read notes and logs, I can go read the fallout wiki.
---
holding out hope that the prestige system will make this obsolete somehow
---
IT WAS ME
---
But for us people who don’t really do pvp much they take up way too much budget. And we need as much budget as possible to build our overly detailed bases. But in survival I bet rocket turrets and the sort will dominate home defense
---
I found him at the front of the house by EM-B1-27 in flatwoods.
---
Plead with Bethesda? But besides that no. 
---
Also, fragmenting the player base isn't a good idea for a struggling game.
---
Let's say I want to play in Survival but my friend who doesn't like PvP prefers to play in Adventure mode. If characters can't freely transition then there's no compromise - one of us has to give up our preference or not play together. On the other hand if I can switch freely then I can play in Adventure with my friend and in Survival by myself.
---
Oh boy :(
---
Yeah this is exactly what I feared about Fallout 76 backslash: they could just leave the game as a failure and move on. Thankfully they did release a detailed roadmap and, despite the issues and bugs that still need fixing, this last update has been great. They could have just ignored FO76 and move on to their next game to avoid spending resources because as long as their next game is really good and polished they will keep selling.
---
I also played Andromeda and it surely was different and had it's flaws, but I didn't understand the hate until I saw a video with the original facial animations. I'm surprised they managed to fix them all in a single update. I had some complains about the story, I really disliked the main villain and the kett design (race concept was good but they looked kinda bad imo), there was no real final boss and the story felt lacking in some rewards. But yeah it did not deserve all the hate either, it was not the same but that doesn't mean it was bad. Canceling post launch content after all that work was just outrageous.
---
You bulk for selling to vendors.
---
I think it was done to prevent melee from having an even greater resource advantage.
---
20% more exp too 
---
Im devastated
---
Mine works but not always. Not sure why.
---
Shoot, we need a mod for that in FO4, and half the NPCs smoke like forest fires...
---
I know... Bethesda would have to decide to increase the stash limit again. Do you scrap your junk before storing it? That'll massively cut down on how much space is being taken up.
---
If you're on PC I'll give you one.
---
You're not changing anyone's mind here.
---
I agree.  The difficulty is obviously geared towards lower levels which is fine, but a bit of a missed opportunity.  Hopefully some of the upcoming content will satisfy people that want more of a challenge and not just a fun distraction.
---
If only the world actually worked that way. "I dun got problems, so they not real!!1!!"
---
I want ghoul skin.  I don't want to be a smoothie. 
---
Yes I know. I said that in a reply.
---
Literally the opposite of what Fasnacht is supposed to be lol. I dont understand why people cry about virtual masks. 
---
Offtopic: Fasnacht is all about getting together, have fun, play Instruments(usually a Piccolo and and a drum) to make loud noises to evict the winter so spring can begin. Thats what the original purpose of fasnacht was(and still is to a degree) here in Switzerland. 
---
yes the amount of players on a map was also a concern.  I hoped this idea battles that by providing events that would be highly populated like the current fasnacht event, drawing people to certain locations.  as the events will hop around you could be fighting in your location or theirs.  It would be interesting to see how it played out.  But you are correct, without the players it would not be as effective as it could be, i guess this reason is why it fully fits fallout 76 because as great as it is, it if far from reaching its full potential.
---
Ghoul skin would be sick!
---
My guess is that the drop rate is bugged but Bethesda doesn't want to admit it because a) patching console versions cost money and b) they get slammed for every bug that comes up. There's no way they intended every rare mask to be obtained by at most one or two players throughout the event. 
---
Easier just to say "working as intended" because it's not like they're going to lose money over folks not getting the new masks.
---
It sounds like the Mr Blobby song. -_-
---
Booze. 
---
You can bum rush a rocket turret. Machine guns relentlessly firing on you is a totally different ballgame.
---
He’s definitely my favourite..
---
“The band didn’t show... e-ohhh”
---
I believe quad harpoon to be the best weapon I used and I used quite a bit of them.
---
The build must supplement the gear. The best gear is contextual and must be used appropriately. The perks that works great for sentinel builds can be hinderance for cavaliers. Some of the mutations mandatory for bloodied builds are optional or problematic for non-bloodieds. It may be very effective to mix melee and ranged. My PvP character can't melee at all.
---
Think of it as complicated rock paper scissors. You can't ask which one is the best (obviously scissors lol), its more relevant to ask 'which is the best rock'. It takes some hours of deep research before you grasp the wonderfull mess this game is.
---
I find the mix of cavalier and sentinel armor to be the most effective in real PvP not math tests done on stationary targets.
---
Yeah, I do. The problem is that I don't have a fixed camp, I only use the camp thing when I need to store or repair something, I'm low level but already working on my power armor parts and resources, so I have stored 800 already :(
---
You won’t hear the warning unless you’re online when the nuke is launched

I have not played in several weeks, \[like 5 or 6\] I see the disconnect issues have not been resolved.

We downvote you because you're an asshole who no one likes. If anyone should be banned in this chain it's you for your negativity. He is in no shape or form a moderator of that sub, so it isn't promoting, he's recommending. If you get a lot of downvotes it means you're doing something wrong.

It’s gonna be fun seeing the different types of defenses people come up with in survival
---
I think the cult shrine in the Helvetia church uses the owl head and sloth toes. 
---
I like the ammo crafting system that New Vegas uses. Sometimes ill go and drop unusable ammo in front of Vault 76, overseers camp, flatwoods, etc.
---
Gotcha. Do you store your power armor pieces (like, arms, torso, etc) directly in the stash box or do you put them on PA frames and then store them?

Someone claimed to have seen him at Charleston Train station, which is the same location that the secret protectron vendor can spawn. That vendor sells rare outfits like the the clean spacesuit and helmet, hunters longcoat, etc.
---
The spawnpoint is on the left of where you spawn at the station, just in front of the red shed. To get mobs to spawn there (including vendors), you run to the red bridge in front of you, go halfway across it and wait. You can look back where the mobs spawn (look, not walk over there yet). Can take a few seconds because the world is still loading to a degree. Keep in mind it can take anywhere between 3 server hops or 50+. Sometimes the rng is just horrendous.
---
I had that happen and I lost my loot bag and the legendary weapon I was using. Bethesda's answer was sorry about your luck. It's not a new bug. Has been going on for a while.
---
A set time entrance delay for old characters could also work.
---

Please yes
---
1. That person would be suffering a fate worse than death just leaving the game running while inside a foundation or rock. Where's the fun?
---
1. You can always nuke them.
---
If you sit there and get shot for 10 stimpacks you have no one to blame but yourself
---
I can fuel my alcoholism by making booze in game while I drink irl? That’s all I needed to know. 
---
I agree, however it would probably cause a ton of clipping issues with outfits. That’s why we see short hair/hair that is always up :/
---
Solution I found in a youtube video (I'll link later for credit) but you just walk away (if you have the noise perk so you can hear it, just walk away until you cant hear it) then walk back and search will appear.  It has worked for me every time.
---
TLDR: Walk away from cap stash, walk back
---
Watoga vendors had on yesterday. 
---
Your detailed explanation really make you the library IT guy. I don’t like the low health part of bloodied. What would be the best gear against PvE, and what bloodied weapon to use? Mainly ranged, instead of melee. I am considering a new build and have enough perk points stacked to completely reconfigure my character. I’m not much into PvE. I will lose against other players because I am not that good. Also the negative stereotype I have that PvP players are toxic or trolls because i’ve encountered too many players like this makes PvP a no-go for me.
---
Exacly
---
You werent slapped to death. 
---
If you died quick, it was full damage. 
---
Slaps deal 1% dmg . its very slow and always results in wanted levels. They got you somehow else. 
---
Did someone "seek revenge"?
---
If a teamate initated PvP by returning a slap (by accident or on  purpose) it will then initiate PvP for both teams. All players. 
---
I thought it was boring
---
Ok cool I can hop on now, I’ll join your game
---
Damn, that would've been great! I've been hunting violet flux for some PA upgrades for a while, lol.
---
Still in the process of being able to use those. Did the dmv stuff last night to join the BOS.
---
Uncommon cowl
---
Truth. I really wish we would get more, abd I wish the concrete walls didn't clip as hard as they do. They are a bitch to place
---
Ehh. I run into more than enough characters with their faces exposed.
---

---
That's an under-armor and isn't an Atom Shop item.

Expect well crafted booby traps.  Because if someone gets into your fortress, unless you have a way out...you’ll need them.
---
That's Overseer material right there.
---
Do you have starched genes equipped?

Take a look at this and see what you think

Somebody once whacked the scorch beats queen with a sledge after hours of prep and launching a nuke
---
I didn't see a sloth when I played. Now I'm seeing in the comments that it comes out of the woods, so all of the high level players probably got it before I even saw it. Had no idea. 
---
That’s just wrong. 
---
Hmm I guess I was mistaken. It was right after the beta anyway.
---
New set of quests that lets you make your own alcohol, limited-time events, and I think survival mode.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXSwR8FFBf0
---
Pick one of those locations and server hop until you get it. It's what i did to get the recipes
---
I think your wrong..Bethesda has alot of player kissing butt to do...they don't need anymore knee jerk crap shows...fallout 76 has turned me off from playing any other Bethesda game..or want of even a new one...the event showed they cant even handle doing a event worth the rewards much like they cant handle doing a game vs the cost
---
Human meat is the normal answer, but even that doesn't work for this game. As all the humans have been dead for months or years before this game. All the raiders were dead in like 2096 
---
If they did that it would take away from the grind.
---
Even if these masks are out there at all, they're so rare they may as well be one of a kind.  Someone would probably trade 100k caps worth of rare items for one.. trade for the other masks my ass
---
I would suggest the Overseer’s Camp. If you look up the road to flatwoods past the truck, see if there are balloons to the side of the road. If so, you have the lemonade stand. It doesn’t take too long to see if you need to server hop. 
---
I've ran into it a couple of times. I never want to kill it. The MothFather is the best. 
---
I saw the Lemonade stand by the Rusty Pick on the road South of Charleston Fire department
---
What about PvE? Anything you would recommended? Is bloodied even the most powerful build to go for in PvE? Besides. Scissors are made out of rock. It’s metal. Which came from the rock itself. The original material is better. Say you have obsidian. It’s impossible to melt down properly irl. But I don’t know how strong an obsidian rock would be irl. Also diamond. Rocks beat everything!
---
Im out for a meal for the next few hours or so but its MrGlayden
---
Each piece separately, but I have like 10 pieces in total
---
I just figured most of them didn’t know what they were getting into. They probably just saw a nuke zone and wants to get some loot. I was just dissapointed becausenthe first one was so much fun but the second one was 30 minutes of bullshit lol
---
I have a level 75 that you I'm using and I've found the best way for everyone to get involved is for the high lvl characters should have a stopping point on the sloth. Drain it to half or even three quarters health and let the lower levels have at it unless they are getting ganged. 
---
Did they change it in a patch, or was ut always like that?
---
I like that these threads never agree on "best". 
---
There is no best. Balance is pretty decent rignt now.
---
Excellent. Glad you found one.
---
I'm on Xbox, but thanks internet stranger, I appreciate the thought!
---
I think it's always been like that. If not, then one of the first few patches I'm pretty sure. 
---
Haha yeah that'll be a big find for you
---
&gt; Imagine the challenge in starting from scratch in Survival mode!
---
Imagine repeating exactly what you can already do any time you want, except some guys who started a few hours sooner are spawn camping at Overseer's CAMP for the first few days.
---
PREACH!
---
You should be able to use them. Only vendor you cannot access without finishing a quest is the whitesprings bunker vendor.
---
I would be fine with even 10 .38 rounds breaking down into 1 steal 1 lead  
---
Lol butt kissing. Do you need your duck washed too?
---
Just hit it enough until bloody mess activates then lootable
---
If there was a bed there you'd pretty much be set. If I ever make a new character he is gonna be living there and sleeping on the couches.
---
You should put the pieces on frames, as they will drastically reduce your stash weight
---
Platform is PC.  
---
Been playing pretty regularly when I can.  This is the first time in weeks I had any rashes to desktop.  
---
I thought the vendor in watoga was only accessible to people that did the BOS stuff?
---
Also, do I need to complete mayor for a day? 
---
Are there any BoS chapters on the PC recruiting?
---
Stimpacks are rare my dude fuck I look like giving my packs out to some rando
---
Heavy BOS I’m pretty sure because marine falls under sturdy armor.
---
Bob dropped the waffle on Saturday named monkey fish. How do you dance the tango.
---
this is my last statement. no reason to answer.
---
you just said that it is ***impossible*** to ***design*** a system which would run better on smaller connections then on bigger connections.
---
that is nonsense.
---
goodbye.
---
That’s why powerful, Not best in title :)
---
Thanks for that. Seen 100-200, becuase event, but never seen the wise version in the wild
---
Simple solution. Allow character transfer for bonuses and new rewards, nerf god rolled PvP builds or increase PvP damage on other builds. Level the playing field out so I don’t hop in and lose 300caps every time I get merc’ed
---
Put them on the frames then store. Saves so much stash space.
---
You totally get it!!
---
And if you want to quickly undo the effect, put on a mask you only have one of, then take it off. 
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2vh4g/new_research_complete_guide_to_the_best_armor_sets/)
---
This has great info as to what the best armor is for each category (DR, ER, RR)
---
I haven't gotten any messages, just a momentary hesitation then the game disappears entirely.  
---
I like it mostly because it's not hard enough to need PA. I don't know why, but the sounds PA makes while walking, running or doing literally anything urks me to no end..
---
I was solo. Was with a group of people but not linked on a team. His indicator didn’t turn red. I hadn’t engaged in any PvP, mostly farming the parades. Had not shot at or been shot at by anyone else. Had spent the few minutes prior trading extra masks. Then I saw bullets and got the death animation. I was given no opportunity to seek revenge. I just had to respawn and hike back. More than once. Even if I had been wanted, killing me would have erased that.
---
This is why I’m so confused. I understand PvP and avoid it because it’s just not a part of the game I want to engage in. I understand why it’s there and I understand the appeal, it’s just not for me. But how it went last night isn’t how it’s supposed to work.
---
A whole new world of camp building...I’m giddy with excitement at the various ways I can be killed!
---
Beer 20 hour refresh recipes. I do them on my alts and pass to my main. I have all but 1 unlocked now. 
---
You get to also tryout new builds. 
---
There's been a couple of posts where people have found where he's located. The building he'll be in is boarded up but there's gaps you can see inside and someone's used a vats glitch to get inside. That's all I've seen or heard so far. 
---
Maybe?  It's looking like it was just me so far, and I hadn;t had similar problems for a few weeks now.
---
Loved the back to the roots analysis!
---
Anything thats PvP-aligned makes you ignore PvE challenges almost completely. The exception is bloodied, while its effective in PvE it makes your PvE life hard simultanously. I highly recommend cavalier leaning cavalier-sentinel mix as the most all-around powerful build. Not the most powerful. The most versatile. 
---
Ahh, if you can try to store your pieces on power armor frames. The frames only weigh 10lbs even if they have every power armor piece on them. Makes storing em a lot easier. 10lbs vs like 50lbs lol.
---
Oh alright.
---
We crash to main menu, not to desktop :/
---
mule account to carry excess stuff.
---
get quest rewards your scraped or tossed before you realized you couldnt remake them.
---
get a higher lvl version of said rewards since you now know about them.
---
things like that.
---
Yeah, the load time is terrible. 
---
Vendors, people who sell online need ALOT more space than 800. No where near enough to trade aswell as have a personal gear set with backup materials.
---
People buy upwards of 100’s lbs worth of weight, no way you can store than on your main, with ammo/clothing/gear/aid/junk etc.
---
I have a 2nd account just for my spare items, items i want to keep... but can’r store, because y’know... extremely limiting stash limits are ridiculous.
---
It's a nice message and all, but like
---
I dream about organized factional wars. 
---
diff builds
---
So long as it isn’t this one shot, explosive, god touch crap.  I want everyone to have standard weapons and armor if I’ll even entertain playing this mode.
---
It says you’re offline. Btw my GT is BelgianBeerLuvr 
---
I just finished my heavy build. [Here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f554b69&amp;d=ls2lt2a04c72ib4ip2pq1sq2s82sr2s32eh2ic2er1a80lu2pl2ss1s00&amp;w=&amp;n=) is the build. I still want to tweak it some but it’s such a blast to use. I run a TSE .50cal and it melts everything in its path. 
---
that would defeat the purpose of a more "hardcore" survival mode....
---
So, how do you stop non rotting food from just making the game extremely easy as you always have a library of all the best recipes, collected at minimum urgency?    
---
Like nothing is hard about collecting all the recipe ingredients, the only limit to any of them is it's hard to collect and use it in a time frame. If you can just keep things consequence free you can just have scorch beast stew whenever. collected leisurely.   
---
This game isn't exactly hard as it is, do they need an even more softcore mode? 
---
Yeah, food is so easy to get/craft and it has multiple advantages. You can heal anywhere, anytime, and at a lot faster rate than sleeping in a bed. Plus they come with stat bonuses and other benefits
---
I'm on PS4 and I've had a very different experience.  Sucks it's been bad for you.  I play late evening maybe that makes a difference?  
---
I have the skull mask which not seen others wearing
---
You HAVE to post a video of you getting there.
---
Grinding Dailies and being a mule. 
---
just dont log out there if you are not in power armor.
---
it is a popular nuke site.
---
It’s gonna be allowed to use ur previous character so most of the fighting will be one shot assassin sentinel builds :(
---
I don't know why Bethesda didn't just offer an extra 200 pounds of stash for let's say 500 caps per month. They would make money and please (most) people. 
---
While I do think that these masks are probably too rare for the event, I also think that most true thing I've read in this thread is that nobody is going to really care in a week.  The rare ones aren't even that great and its just the rarity and urge to collect.  That and we've just been dying for new content.  
---
My favorite rewards are the beret and burning effigy for our CAMPs.  What I would have liked is lederhosen and one of the hats with a feather in it.
---
What would you go for, pure from a PvE perspective if you’d ignore PvP completely?
---
Oh noooo. To be fair, my brother told me about that entire Mall before I'd really explored WS, so who knows how long it would have taken me to find it on my own lol. I remember I went upstairs once and got lost in there and just fast traveled out. 
---
Upstairs somewhere is a bar that sells booze, and near the bar another drink area that sells Nuka Cola products.
---
Hey Nymith
---
I too was looking for a BoS chapter, sadly most are defunct or privet, so I decided to start my own chapter. At the moment its just me but I am pushing to grow it. I would be happy to recruit you into the ranks, I would offer you an expedited track on the rank you want if you chose to join at this stage of the chapter. 
---
This. For all we know, legendary trading might be like the vendor machines in the game that require specific tokens to buy things from the terminal, and you might get more tokens per star.  And  you  get  to decide  between  buying  a  random  legendary item for  a low token cost, or a guaranteed  type of legendary  item (weapon or armor) with a much higher cost.
---
Check when Windows and/or your video drivers last updated. I haven't had problems in a while, but for a time every time Windows would update it would put in its own wifi drivers that overrode the manufacturer-recommended ones. Same with video.
---
But it's ok, because spoiled meat is one of the ingredients. So if they go bad, you can recycle them. Just grind them up with some more spices and stuff then into a new intestine!
---
Nice! I have a TSE 50 cal tucked away for now.
---
Why did you kill me bröther
---
I thought that the first day was pretty fun.  Especially because you had more players participating.  It kind of just became grinderino and too easy after that.
---
Don’t pick them up if you don’t use them. Survival. 
---
Were you looking for one in particular? Lots of people sell them, I am opening shop next week at 150/per, but if you're desperate I can sell you one or two in a few hours after work.  
---
Is that confirmed?  Or just speculation at this point.
---
If you didn't give ballistic fibre I would have lefr you in peace
---
Dual box both accounts.  Use main with all unlocked CAMP Plans to build cool houses/bases on alts.
---
Level a high Charisma alt, then Team Share a very useful Perk with main.  Frees up perk slots on main.
---
Okay, I am down. Lets do it!
---
Or a battle royale. 
---
I saw lots of posts about it being transferable and them offering a full restart of characters. I’m not personally sure but I would like the full reset so the grinders would be rewarded instead of everyone flooding in with one shot builds
---
Goose
---
Power Armor Helmet Mod. Highlights all living targets. 
---
+karma
---
Cavalier sentinel mix the same. No assassin perks within the armor, instead: chameleon, regenerating, and any three that you manage to get that would contain -15% dmg when standing/sprintjng.
---
I had no issues until the last update, since then I have been having similar issues. I know it’s not my internet. I’ve also been getting an error message sometimes on the front screen saying it can’t find a game mode for me at the moment which is new.
---
I totally agree and think it would be sensible for a large chunk of ESO gameplay chunks to make it into 76.
---
However I assume the voting stuff around the map is to rig an election to become president for some Enclave quest line in the future.
---
I will dm you further instructions. Welcome, ad victoram.
---
God. These whiteknight posts are getting out of hand. 
---
I mean, with all due respect if that's the case then you guys may want to reconsider what you think is an acceptable drop rate for a time-limited event. Fully half the mask rewards are SO rare that a sub with over 100,000 people can find very few credible reports of even seeing them in person, much less gotten one of their own. Maybe it makes sense for ONE of the masks to be that rare, but five? Where's the sense is spending development money on art assets most players will never even see? 
---
You can say "not everyone who plays is in this sub" and that's true- but it's still a huge sample size. Ignoring the fact that this many people are saying "is it even dropping?" should be a huge red flag. 
---
I am pretty sure I through mine away because I did camp mccormick long before I even knew the dvm quest was a thing. but was still able to do it. but I might be wrong.
---
have you tried going back and seeing if you can get a new copy?
---
Unless Bethesda actually said so somewhere and I missed it, I’ll remain a skeptic.
---
Thanks buddy! Much appreciated
---
I'm hoping now that they've cracked down on the duping they'll increase our stash. 
---
Yeah he just says lines about the commies
---
Booo booo booo most of the pvp player base won't play the survival mode if we can't have our characters we have been leveling and grinding put ass off since the release since we all new there would eventually be pvp servers we didn't go through all this hard work so you fucking who want a harder pve with a small side of pvp can bitch about them however I do think some effects do need to be nerfed before the servers go up such as sentinel and assassin because not being able to kill a man because hes standing is stupid
---
Thank you so much buddy!
---
 I can usually make it in the door. ;)
---
Nah, you can go to Watoga whenever you want and use their vendor. Mayor for a Day def helps keep the hostile robots off your back tho.
---
Were you on a team earlier... With someone who owned a workshop? It would have reverted to your ownership when that person logged out. 
---
You could own workshops without even knowing You own a workshop. Lol.
---
The pvp engagement system is messy. People like me who farm players for caps seem to know it the best  we are always trying to see what we can get away with. 
---
I kill people at the parade event. You gotta abandon the event and tag their work shop. People are always confused about how i do it. 
---
Thats why im happy to troubleshoot what got you into the engagement. Just need kore info from you. 
---
Do you have any mutations that proc when you are hit? Was a melee player hitting you first? Was your health at 4% or lower?  Did you throw any gernades? Did you have pacifist on?
---
did you check the printer?
---
The ability to go back and forth between both modes on a whim already defeats the purpose of it. So whats the difference?
---
Happy hunting
---
I build my C.A.M.P. in high traffic areas. I have a "house", "Outdoor bar/stage with all the instruments", and "garage". I have 3 of the big water purifiers and a full garden of corn and razorgrain for anyone to take. Hearing your story makes me happy to know I'm not alone. I like to think I'm a free lance Responder working for the Free States.
---
You thought it was fun? 
---
I think the only way for the for the masks to drop is to let the Sloth kill a robot.  There is a note in the Church that mentions something about a "sacrifice to the Harvester".   Unfortunately,  in a group of random people, that is not something easily tested
---
Where’s the printer?
---
Yeah i been running an event for years in another game and havent got that item. Rng is rng and i bet some people get these masks, not even half the community that plays goes on here. So the poll that was made is not fact
---
And besides, spoiled meat is not exactly rare these days. :)
---
Ranged or melee? 
---
Pve or pvp?
---
Word. There are some decent people out there
---
I think your right in regards to it being a quest tied to the enclave, but it would be very cool to see it work with other factions. Imagine the responders having a faction and getting a president. It could make the sever change for a few hours to fit more with the responders way of life. 
---
it use to only be 200. be happy.
---
I dont really remember. I want to say behind him, but I think I remember going upstairs to get it.
---
Freezer full of people meat up in Boston, though. 
---
Ranged and PvE
---
Its almost the same logic that makes you wonder why people work so hard to post about hating the game. 
---
I think that would make it too easy to bypass serums and use rads to get most of the mutations and then delete the few you don’t want. 
---
&gt; The ability to go back and forth between both modes on a whim already defeats the purpose of it.
---
I too enjoy bitching about a feature that has yet to be released and as such have no idea how it actually affects the game.
---
How do you transfer stuff from one character to another? 
---
I think it would be cool if they let you exchange, say, 10 one star legendaries  for a two star legendary. And then do 10 two stars for a three star. That way one three star legendary is worth a hundred one stars. Or even do it by a factor of a hundred, so one 3 star is worth 10,000 one stars. I guess we will just have to wait and see what the mechanics will be like though.
---
Cause I like it, I think it's fun, and you can fuck right off with your stupid ass bullshit post
---
No sooner I said it another pic popped up on the filthy casuals sub lol. I spend a lot of time farming dailies ( when they work! ) trying for the rare outfits and running the asylum for the nurse outfits so I'm used to riduculouly low odds but seems very harsh on a time limit. It's a shame as other than that the new content has been awesome.
---
no freezers
---
1 was able to make @ 25 stable violet and a like 5 of a few others. This was only the 3rd time I've been in a non White Springs / SBQ fissure nuke zone. It was nice change of pace.
---
You should consider laying down in traffic
---
A lot of them didn't. I was on another forum where there was so many that would hop in and say "hurr I just saw me a video saying your game sucks" optional they'd leave a link. I got into an extensive argument on how your opinion didn't matter if you didn't play the game. Seriously, in what other place could you say "I have no experience with said subject but here is my opinion."
---
Hard to get back in when you've been re banned... oh well. I got I think 4 of the masks. And had a little fun. And I really enjoyed everyone working together. 
---
Yea but that appears for me all the time and I don't wear pa. Everyone can see it even if you don't have it?
---
Because "survival" isn't adventure mode? about the only thing survival mode has is harsher penalties for death. take those away and it become pointless.
---
I agree and disagree. You say it's not about the masks, but it kind of is. If there was no reward no one would do it. But I agree that its about having fun. People are mad that the event doesn't scale, which I get, but it lets the noobs have a fighting chance.
---
For reference I am a level 13
---
When does this dumb event end? I haven't played this game in like 2 months cuz it sucks dick ass, but clothing items are like the only reason I give a crowd about anything related to it.
---
On ticks. The logging facility near vault 76
---
Idk man u wasted your time on this steaming pile of crap post so I guess you can figure it out yourself
---
People wanted New Vegas 2 
---
That shack just down from vault 76 has 4 ticks.
---
 Then continue down to the lumber mill and that also has 4 ticks.
---
Other then that the mire has alot of ticks.
---
Define power. Do you only care about damage per hit? Damage per second? For which situation? Ranged weapons get a head start on their damage verses melee. Are we talking PVE only or PVP considerations too. There are a variety of situations where certain builds are more "powerful" than others.
---
I love unyielding armor with low health, rarely use my PA anymore.
---
Everyone in the party had to have the outfits. 
---
Point pleasant. Moonshiners shack, the lumber mill. Equip the butchers bounty perk.
---
I found blood packs of them but when i try to craft the tequila from biv’s it says that i need blood, not blood packs
---
It's easy to tag the sloth. Just wait for it to spawn. I'm a level 13 and I hit it every time because I sit there and stare at its 3 spawn trees
---
It is totally badass if you want to show the world your inner banana 
---
sorry to read that but my overall experience is different. Have made the Fastnacht event 4 time now and the people there where mostly nice. Also in other events, the one who see the legendary hit it once and then emotied the others to come.
---
Compared to the real life the people in fallout are nicer. .oO( what does this says about my real life? ) ;)
---
It's easy to tag the sloth. Just camp and wait for it to spawn. I'm a level 13 and I hit it every time
---
Damn, had no idea people still played this game. 
---
How are you even finding the event active I've gone to helvetia several times and server hopped for up to an hour without finding any active events on any servers. I've only managed to actually do the event twice the first was as soon as it went live and the second I joined just as the event was ending but got roped into the event and got a mask and plans anyways.
---
honestly joining at the last minute and getting the rewards even though I didn't have to do anything isn't that bad a scenario I just wish I could find active events more often.
---
why waste time making a troll account for games you dont like?
---
its not our fault you have terrible taste in games.
---
The owl mask is rare? That's the only one I have. 
---
It happens about once every hour... Just wait 😁
---
Agreed, why is there not a BoS skin for this or anything but T-60
---
Why are there not more faction items and paint in the game! This is easy mode art department stuff man. 
---
That’s what I thought from doing math from the tooltip weight but the tooltip is wrong. Test it. You’ll see immediately. Bulking saves weight in nearly all cases. It’s hard to be precise because there aren’t enough significant digits on your personal or stash weight numbers. 
---
There’s cryolators and whole fridges/milk dispensers.  Someone could figure out what to do. 
---
Pack it up, gentlemen, he got us 
---
"The masks are purely cosemetic" lol wussies
---
I've only ventured in there a coupe times,might have to take another look,not sure where to start.
---
Yeah I figured I might just have to sit on a server and wait around for up to an hour. If only there was more to do in that area. I guess it's one of the prices I pay for being permanently over encumbered and not having fast traveled from level 4 to 202.
---
Only PvE, can’t say anything about damage. I do know my play style is either combat or stealth

The Phoenix Vendor in Watoga usually sells a ultracite laser plan
---
I've assumed 2 or more people could circumvent the vendor cap limits by having multiple characters to sell from. 
---
Maybe use a main to farm lots of loot. Reach vendor cap limit. Trade remaining loot to friends alt. They sell and reach vendor cap limit on that alt. Player 1s Main then sells whatever trash laying around for all the caps Player 2 alt has just made. Rinse and repeat across multiple toons until you have nothing to sell. 
---
Now that Player 1s main is all looted out. Player 2 gets their turn and on P1s swaps to alts to repeat the process for P2. 
---
Seems time consuming and boring but I'm sure there are some try-hards willing to wring every last cap from their trash collections. 
---
I think it is called "The Interloper". It is what all those cultists are worshipping. 
---
That thing is horrifying. Honestly, the less I know about it the better.
---
Yeah it's kind of weird how we "make" tubs, toilets, etc from "scratch" but somehow a brand new fixture is dirty, rusty, and falling apart? 
---
It's like how you put a paint job on your power armor and it's already scratched and dinged up. 
---
It'd be cool if everything you made started new and shiny, and with wear got dirty. We have soap, we have water, why can't we clean our houses! And our clothes! I'd rather be naked then wear that underwear lol.

I need help building a church for my gang of wasteland preachers.
---
Could always be from the dev room tho
---
I snuck up on one on a highway in the Bog and one tapped him. Don’t rightly know what he was doing there but whatevs.
---
Tbh not really sure The Dragon is worth it at all unless it's Instigating, as the dps is so low.  
---
Don’t know that it fires enough to benefit like and automatic does.
---
Maybe do weapons artisan so you can repair it up to 200%?  Also that’s a passive one so you can swap out when not using.
---
Pacifist is my default setting. I rarely exit it. I checked, and it was on. 
---
Was solo. No teammates for me. Just happened to be in a cluster of people but wasn’t on a team and hadn’t been all evening. 
---
My only mutation is speed demon. 
---
Armor is all variations of basic leather. 
---
No grenades.
---
Health was probably 85%. 
---
And no melee. First engagement was getting shot and dying.
---
wow, that is pretty eye-opening, having to work with such a custom engine and its limitations, it is impressive they've been able to do what they have. Still, for the players, knowing the backstory doesn't help that a 2019 game doesn't have 2019 features. Heck, it doesn't have 2009 features.
---
I wonder what phenomenon drove you to post here and be so bothered 
---
If you're above 50lvl he will attack you. Under 50 he should be friendly or neutral 
---
He likes to sleep.
---
Yeah, each player of the game should collect a "Valid Ballot" item (common near some voting locations) Use it to see if there a pending vote. if there is one they can vote for future updates/patches

Lol... 😃

---
Says the person who actually plays fo76 😂
---
Yeah! Except for Bob. He used to steal my Nuka-Colas. So screw Bob!
---
I checked last night still at 550 but not sure how I am getting it. I also only have a level 3 strong back and 14 strength. Didn’t see any other perks that stood out. Also have a bunch of mutations with -4 strength which makes this a little more interesting. Not using class freak. Pretty sure my second character on a different account/Xbox has a similar carry weight maybe a little less. 
---
I believe someone went through thoroughly and explained exactly how it works it went along the lines of lod works with how many times the trigger is pulled. But hey who am I or original op. Take this as you will
---
I killed a bunch of them and there wasn't any blood offered,I'm stuck as well.
---
At least I didn't waste money on it
---
Dude use this map.
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
The guys post history is all trolling. He is deff jerking off to this right now.
---
I was in a team and dropped all my stuff to transfer on the ground at my camp then switched characters, joined with team and picked it up
---
P.S. this is a little risky and having a trusted friend hold them is a lot better idea
---
Lore police would be after you saying that Jet couldn't have been invented yet
---
When you fast travel to WS, if you go to the right of the main entrance, down some stairs, there is a door that spawns you in the shopping plaza, instead of the top of the stairs inside. Not a huge deal, but saves a few seconds usually.
---
What difference does it make? duper's carry weight is limited as well and cannot carry any more than hoarders. Which means hoarders stress the servers as much as any dupers.
---
This is why I only select one at a time. Even if they were color coded I would still only have one quest active at a time.
---
Luck of the draw is decent for anything non-automatic. I am not sure about the interaction with luck of the draw and multiple projectiles in terms of activation rate, but it could be amazing if it has a chance to activate per ball.
---
Weapon Artisan may be more worthwhile as it allows you to repair your weapon up to 200% durability.
---
This is beautiful :) Thank you!

Highly limited ugly mug shields

Ooh I dig it, pitched roof and a shrine to the vault Tec gods I’m thinking of ideas already, shoot me a message on XBL, we can talk it through

I hate killing the sloths, they're usually just bros minding their own business :(
---
Get rekt losers 
---
Pro tip:
---
Don't forget to use the Per Perk, Butcher's Bounty on ticks.
---
I like AAE &amp; Furious explosive, 
---
&amp; instigating &amp; TSE. Vats effects are nice too.  
---
I know people who carry around 7 Dragons. Cycle thru them instead of reloading.  Start with instigating, then bloody, then aae etc...
---
PvE is easy mode. You can handle most content in this game with a water pistol. Dont worry bout it. Have fun
---
People like what they like.  Also, asking people to explain something to you while coming off as an asshole isnt the right move.
---
Or they know how rare it is and want IRL cash to trade for it. 
---
Nothing wrong with playing a good game.
---
Some people just have better taste than you.
---
yeap more beards, eyebrows, hair maybe stuff like piercings, tattoes, body scars and overall more of anything.
---
Luck of the draw is crap. I’ve tried using both rank 1 and rank 3 for significant amounts and have more or less given up on the perk.
---
Rank 3 repairs a lot (more than half, maybe 75%) but procs so, so, so rarely
---
Rank 1 barely repairs any condition but procs a little more often. Still not frequent enough to be very helpful though.
---
Only exception is with shotguns since apparently each pellet has a chance to proc the repair.  
---
Rank 2 at one point was broken and never worked at all. So idk if that’s been fixed
---
Make sure you're scrapping all of your junk before stashing it
---
Narcissism
---
No you need to learn an engram to craft it. And there are not enough engram points to learn everything.  And you can only craft the base versions of those weapons without blue prints that are RNG. 
---
&gt;  This is how pvp on most MMOs work 
---
Then why even introduce the game mode?
---
I’m not so much mad about the rarity of some of the masks as I am just puzzled by it. It’s only a week long event. There are only so many events anyone is going to be able to participate in. That extreme or high rarity just makes the event less worthwhile to participate. Once people have the four or five masks that are easiest they’ll give up. No reason to be at the party for something near impossible to get. It’s a fun event that’s getting tarnished by some poorly thought out rarity scheme. 
---
Thanks buddy, I remember the water pistol from Fallout 4 :p
---
But you were on the workshop. .. Hmm. 
---
My guess is you accendentily hit center mouse and contested the workshop initiating PvP. Ir you sprinted thru someone with power armor and the power armor sprint dmg perk.
---
Other than that i have no idea. 
---
For me, it's not about the armor type.  It's all about the legendary effects the armor has.
---
You're wrestling with these player's sense of entitlement. They post here to get reinforcement for their cognitive bias. Good on you for fighting the good fight. Keep having fun!
---
Human waste isn't really a good fertilizer AFAIK, it's just fine to me that we can't get fertilizer from the Porto. 
---
Oh, good to know, I'll look into that
---
I'm new and people get mad when I just sit there in trade because I'm trying to figure out the awful interface. I'm sorry I don't understand it, but give me a second when we trade so I can figure it out. However, the community is usually very nice to us newcomers. Honestly I like the comradery more than the game
---
Well, in terms of stealth, combining the perks concentrated fire, covert operative, and mister sandman will increase your total non-critical hit damage by x7.5 provided you are shooting something in the weak spot, at night, with a silenced weapon. So, that is pretty powerful.
---
Looks great ! Thanks for the guidance 
---
I didn’t sit there,  I was over encumbered and walking away from them from McClintock,  they pursued me the entire way to Sutton station shooting me the whole way.   
---
I shouldn’t have to jump servers because assholes don’t want other people to “steal their farms”.
---
I just want the randos that drop by my camp to stop leaving the door to the Nuka Cola machine open. Bunch of damn savages. 
---
PS4. feel free to add me if your also on PS4 :)
---
100% this. Or you can wait for him to become a puddle of blood and get the same. 
---
Watch your stats effects tab.
---
If you have Radaway debuff, it is next to impossible to get a mutation.
---
Wait it out, or use a decon shower.
---
I'm sure they have, but few people have such a bad taste that they actually buy fo76 😂
---
Complicated wasn't the point, immersion was. 
---
you on PS4? 
---
&gt; anoying spam, thats my problem
---
You're on the internet, friend. You might as well try to run through the rain and not get wet. 
---
Hey, you are the one playing fo76, not me
---
There’s also the part where it can scale you down on a low level server
---
I mean I wouldnt turn it down...the bath houses in klamath seemed like a good time..especially if Becky has super squeaky clean all around the world services
---
Ton of issues since last update as well 
---
I have way lower luck than all that and I've gotten all of those lol 
---
That is because I have better taste in games.
---
Not currently
---
It makes more sense for ammo to be the going currency then caps, so they don’t want to give it a start.
---
I found him outside the Red Rocket at the Mall in the Mire.
---
200 cap vendor and sold recipies for lemonade and hard lemonade recipe. 
---
Ive already built a church of sorts with a steeple and the Vault Boy statue up above the altar (a dresser), but Im only around lvl 20 and dont have all the blueprints I need. Which Gamertag is yours? 
---
It's stupid they're making no build zones on top of resource nodes. Why the heck have a node there if no one can build on it?
---
Equip the butchers bounty and “search” the tick before you loot it 
---
Why? 
---
Can't something be rare? 
---
Yeah, right, 😂 whatever helps you sleep at night
---
moonshiners hut just near vault 76 
---
Awesome, I should be on around 6est.
---
The event is fun the first like 10 times. Then it's just "Oh another Fasnacht ? ugh ok." go over there and get the same crap.
---
Because the game WAS really bad. I played the beta and day one. The game was a buggy, unplayable mess. I quit until now because the game finally can handle rain. The state of the game at launch was inexcusable. And I know people will get pissed at me for saying this, but it was a cash grab. I know you don't like to hear it, but Bethesda scammed their most loyal customers and I'm still mad about it. That being said, I am enjoying the game now, but it still lacks basic mmo features 
---
Looks like you are in denial. You really should try playing better games.
---
Bad manners, you'd think Vault Tech indoctrination would have taught them better.
---
Well, one thing we've figured out is _where_ he's going to be. There's a shuttered train station in the Mire at the end of the railline by Berkley Springs whose interior matches the clips we've  seen of the Purveyor.
---
The other thing we know is vague which is that there's going to be some ability to trade legendary weapons and armor for other legendary weapons and armor.
---
Now I would like to think the Purveyor will essentially be advanced weapon scrapping. If you have a 1\* legendary he can, for a price, destroy it for scraps with a small chance at receiving a legendary mod that you can apply to an item of your choosing, with 2\* and 3\* items offering greater chances to receive more legendary statuses. Similarly he may offer standalone legendary mods and/or crafting recipes to craft legendary mods as many times as you like but will necessitate extremely rare items like flux, titanium and ultracite. And of course he'll probably sell straight up legendary items.
---
But we'll see!
---
Exactly, all it is is an annoyance but eventually the people who play Survival from the beginning outpace the people who join survival later, and you still end up with the same problems
---
No one has it. 
---
Best and Brightest, indeed 
---
I would not be surprised after the event ends the rare masks go up in the Atom store, for 1 day too. 
---
I haven't seen a nuked one yet and I'm on PC. 
---
Not if only 5 people have the masks...
---
Criticizing a game glitches and bugs based on facts is same for fanatic fans as angry and talking crap about the game.
---
Imagine if Bethesda would sell cars for people. What kind of car would you expect to get if comparing to FO76 release? A brand new car with four different size of tires fitted below and when turning steering wheel to right car turns to left. The doors of the car would only open inward etc. What fanatic fans would think about this kind of car? They would be really happy after 2 year of hot fixing when Bethesda would promise that at least one of the car door is going to open to outward in the near future. Almost perfect car! Why are people still complaining?
---
I don't think the OP's "anger" assessment is fair.  As has become typical lately in this reddit, there seems to be a real vilification of anybody who has any criticism to offer the game.  Fortunately this OP is quite so sycophantic as some of the posts, but still, criticism shouldn't be dismissed.
---
I agree with the idea that there is more to this event than loot, but loot is a big part of games.  The RNG tendency of Fallout 76 has been that of mobile game ridiculousness since the start.  In some ways, they've backed away from the approach (plans), and in others, not so much (X01 Mods).  The introduction of another super rare loot (for a limited time no less) is just off-putting, and I think people should voice their frustration.
---
If frustration isn't voiced developers don't know which way to go in the future.  I'm glad the optimism is amped up as of late, but we have to quit making dissenters the villains.  Are some of them a little over the top...  maybe.  Still, feedback is always great (good or bad).
---
yup, that has been suggested, and I tried that last 2 times I leveled up - The only cards I could pick were the 2 S cards I already had.
---
I've seen him there, but the spawn point was on the other side of the lake (east?).  Sometimes there's a dead person or brahmin, or an unexploded nuke in that location.  Usually accompanied by a few low-level mobs.  If it's the stand, you can see the balloons from a ways away, but it's best to hop the lake and go up the hill to check.
---
If you see a CAMP anywhere near the spawn point, just log out and try again.  Any camp near the location seems to prevent the random events from triggering.
---
Well you do have a point there.
---
Do you have mutation recipes?
---
Sanitary...  Ain't nobody got time for that!!!  :)
---
What was so bad about Fatman?
---
there needs to be more high level gated events or encounters. I am hoping they are coming down the pipe.
---
Before you kill them you have to let them bite you - they'll swell up and turn red. Then let them sit for a second and their redness and swelling will go down. Now you can kill them and they'll usually drop blood. If you kill them while they're swollen, they'll explode and give no blood. If you kill them before you let them bite you they'll have no blood. 
---
I played eso pretty heavily. PvP focused. 
---
DREADLORDS!
---
Player per server, no mounts, long distances become an issue. 
---
But workshops are essentially the castles. Gameplay will be more like it was in the sewers of ESO. 
---
Id like some capture the flag events tho.
---
He did the same to me, I just destroyed it
---
Tea Pot Quest will spawn ticks (as well as ants, and other items.) 
---
Also, SW of Harper's Ferry, there is a shed near the river source with 5-6 ticks in it.
---
I'll take you up on your offer some time this weekend perhaps, a bit of pest extermination so I can get into the abandoned bunker.
---
I’ve heard reports about him popping up last weekish with the recent update.
---
The problem with that would be people playing music that is not appropriate. I know we could just not tune to their stations, but people let their children play this game and those children could be introduced to music that is not appropriate for them.
---
🍆
---
No printer
---
This is tremendous. Spent nearly an hour Fucking around with the Xbox, clearing cache, reset about 6 times. .. changed the dns and first time got logged in. Thank you sir.
---
How much would you want for that 
---
Can only get 1 per server
---
That’s a little out of my pay grade 
---
Thanks to all people! 
---
This is how I’m currently doing it just time consuming (albeit not a lot) would prefer not to do it :) 
---
It’s not misleading,it tells you exactly what your sneak attack bonus is.This is more of a comprehension issue.
---
I've stayed on the same server for about 3-4, I know that's not a lot but I just got the regular stuff. 
---
Wouldnt make a difference. Id still be OP. Dmg output wont matter when im the only one in sentinals/cavaliers/assasins. 
---
Low levels dont have gear with 90% dmg mitigation
---
Same thing happened to me. They obliterated it right at its spawn. Never made it to the street. 
---
Lag, when loading (which can take several minutes lately) is absolutely horrible.  I can see on some systems where you might disconnect from that, so it's certainly possible.  I'm on PC, and disconnects are rare (but it's happened once or twice).
---
Depending on your hardware, it's possible your system isn't handling the lag well and is booting you a lot.  I'm not sure there's a a solution for that though, as the lag *appears* to be a problem with the servers themselves.
---
You get blood about one for every three or four ticks but of course you can get on an unlucky streak. Use butcher's bounty to better your odds.
---
hmmm I must have kept it. the wiki says " This item is not actually designated as a required quest item, so it is  possible to transfer it out of the player character's inventory, which  will prevent advancement of the next quest.  "
---
but it also says " It is possible to return to the Master Sargent and get another certificate if you have lost/dropped yours and have completed [Back to Basic](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Back_to_Basic).  "
---
so you should be able to get another one. no idea why you cant.
---
Oh my god I hate that
---
Oh! Is that why my damage went up? I noticed that but just thought it was something I ate. I too never bothered trying to fix adrenal reaction once it broke.
---
What's worse is someone launching a nuke on Helvetia, rendering the event null until the blast zone goes away. 
---
Work shop is the most common way but if you did not own one or were on a team with someone owning one there are still ways. Also keep in mind you do not have to be near the work shop you can be attacked any where on the map if they attack with a team tactic. The big one that no one thinks about is mutations there are a few that do dmg, this counts for flagging pvp. If one of your mutations does even 1 dmg you are flagged. As for the no vats that one is easy stealth boys, that's specifically what they are for.
---
I mean. Seems like most groups still haven’t figured it out after 210 years on the East coast, so...
---
Are cazadors those fucking death moths from new Vegas
---
If so then I’d literally die
---
Still your fault for going overencumbered. Hit a stimpack, drop something, fast travel away, sneak, block them all and your worries are over.
---
If they made the workshops have a bigger impact or made completely new objectives that ties into the whole faction experience.
---
Full damage all the time
---
Fast travel only on certain locations  
---
20% more exp
---
Quests/events with guaranteed Legendary item (they even show you which item will drop)
---
I mean yeah they have a pretty low value because they are "easily" farmable, but my 1\* bloodied meathook hits for 2k dmg without nukashine so I wouldn't call them useless...
---
It’s hardly a theory. Todd literally describes it that way in a making of video interview. That’s why they didn’t panic over a “failed” game. It hadn’t failed. Because delivering a static perfect product on day one was never even close to the goal. 
---
&gt;is is more of a comprehension issue.
---
lol there is truth to that, but I guess somewhere along the line of 100 levels I forgot that before level 27 I got the 2x sneak attack anyway. 
---
Check your notes. I think he sneaks an insult into notes on your pipboy
---
Also, the even bigger issue of copyright
---
ps4? i ll trad a giant for a witch mask which i have double of
---
I have a second character because  I found some legendary rifles that I like that I didn't want  to give up but aren't useful for my heavy weapons character.  
---
So I transferred the rifles to what is no my rifle character. 
---
But in truth, my second character is really just for messing around and feeding my other character. I was able to find one X01 calibrated shock for one leg on my first character.  I found a second on on my second character, and had a friend help me transfer it. 
---
Your second character's RNG experience may be different and can find things that your first character wanted.
---
You aren't wrong about it being a bit silly to upset about not getting a rare virtual item but it is also a bit silly and meta to be upset with people for being upset over silly things. YMMV. Enjoy your weekend, fellow wastelanders. :D
---
Ha
---
That would be amazing if it did! 😂
---
The whole power armor gift at the end felt weird honestly
---
As stated, this poses the issue of inappropriate things being broadcasted, anywhere from explicit music to pornography audio.
---
Also, there is an even bigger issue of copyrights.
---
Give it to someone you know that can be trusted, then log out, and get your other character, and have your team mate give it to your other character. 
---
Try reading? They explain it at fallout.bethesda.net
---
I've gotten more Witch masks than anything, and I got a Beret on my 5th try. Bro got beret first try. They aren't that rare.

I was on around 7 my time so there is a good chance we did meet lol
---
Spooky lol
---
SO I had a conference call and jumped in. After 15 minutes, just hitting the safes in the cemetery outside Lewisburg (Pleasant Hills?), crashed picking up a bottle of Vodka.  
---
I tried validating my files and they came back OK, so  I guess I check my GeForce drivers next
---
Will do!

Looks like bethesda
---
This alone keeps me from coming back.

My minigun hits at around 80 give or take 3-5 damage if I’m using bobble heads, and I ignore half their armor. So yeah heavy is pretty nice

this happened to me like 4 or 5 times. Sucks nothing notifies you that you are in a new no build zone.

i lost water p urifiers, farms, and rad shower.
---
Hmm, this could explain another player that posted earlier about getting targeted for PVP and they mentioned not being able to target them in VATs.  Also said that the attackers never got wanted levels and they couldn't revenge spawn.
---
No problem! Just PM me when you need me to clear em out!
---
He can spawn on either side of the road and a little up to the left as well if you are looking towards the bonfire. I am not sure if it is random or because now people know where he spawns and are now standing on the spawn point. 
---
I don’t know whether I support you or not
---
So evil. Just like how they added new creatures and mechanics to see whether people would like them! And doing it for free after we had already bought the game!
---
Then those sickos had the audacity to be open to our feedback and add more stuff!  They were tricking us into playing a game that they intended to tune and make content for this test game after it came out by tricking us into thinking it was a real game! Fiends!
---
Say I invited 3 random people who aren't doing the queen raid to a group but I myself was fighting the queen. Since most people melee her you're saying I wouldn't be able to proc my sneak attacks with my rifle even though they're outside my group?
---
Totally anecdotal, since I haven't tested it myself or seen any official word, but someone posted that it was 10% per consecutive shot, likely up to 50% max.  Totally second hand info though, so take it with a grain of salt.
---
It’s ok. I support myself. I am all that matters 😂
---
You bet it's awesome,  I shoot all the biggest guns I have where enemy's aren't at. Just for the fireworks.

Well for me I have lvl 230 character and because of the way PvP works I lose a lot more caps on that character than my other lvl 70 character. Even if I manage to kill an enemy 3 times I’ll usually just break even if they kill me once, imo this is a flaw and should be addressed with the new survival mode coming out. 
---
I basically feel like I can’t bring my lvl 230 over because a few deaths and I’ve depleted my entire vendor run for the day. Imo it should cap out at lvl 100 or so. But yeah that’s one reason for having an alt. 
---
I would have said because why not to why’d you help me
---
Not gonna lie
---
The one great thing about this game is that no one can tell you how to have your fun. So if they want to nuke it, that's what they're gonna do. Other people are trying to have fun too lol.
---
Found the goddamned commie.

'unused ghoul super mutant race'

This could be nothing but it really peaks my interest, could be related to future content? Would love to hear the lore on it if so

Im sorry but this was a rollercoaster of emotions
---
As a few replies have stated. Butcher's Bounty is your best way to get tick blood. Drop rates are terrible but BB rates are really nice. The ranger's place with the Mole man mascot helm has 2-3 spawns. Hunter's shack has a few spawns.
---
Well, this is a bit sad but I can relate to that.
---
I may be interested in helping the Brotherhood. (I’m on PS4 btw)
---
I thought the cultists were worshipping the Mothman? 
---
Canadian internet argument: who helped them
---
He's popped up in about 25-30% of the runs I've done. Always the last wave of baddies.
---
I have a lvl 40 hunters 3* explosive prime
---
The games finally getting updated and all you get on insta is geniuses going "why u add stuff to game no one plays?" they asked for it to be better, they're getting it, and they're still being douchebags
---
Yeah, that's pretty craptacular of someone. 
---
He was launching at anything and everything. The blasts continued to make it hard to see and also dealt unreasonable damage to the spawned enemies.  Made it tough for anyone else to garner XP.
---
174-75.
---
Stealth rifle is fun but squishy if you get detected. 
---
There are some things in the data that are labeled cut and when you see them you get sad because it could have been so cool

Ticks, mostly.

Bootleggers shack near 76, logging facility near 76. 
---
Near 76.
---
Man if I was on when that happened my camp would be fucked
---
It’s just south of there
---
Good post. If everyone gets a Rare item, then it's not really rare, seems more common to me then.
---
Same. I want to make my house small let but can’t.  Not without half floors or wha it of the whitespring carpet or dark laminate wood. 
---
A few NPCs in Flatwoods would be nice (since I basically live there and I'm super lonely there). Besides, it's basically the safest town in the game besides the interior of Whitespring Resort. 
---
Check this link out.  He does a pretty good job digging up a lot of background info.  Interesting stuff.

No use asking these people, they got their blinders on. We've tested it on our fiber line at work and still got DC at random. This is on PC and PS4 pro. Some are more lucky than others I guess.
---
Maybe it’s time to invest in a console :(
---
I dunno. I have 4 characters. 
---
Just, for when the mood strikes me to "play a different way". I don't have mules, don't transfer stuff. Each character is 100% independent of all others.
---
That’s really their only defense of keeping the rates that low on purpose. They want us to buy them, I bet. 
---
There’s a little glitch with it and mister sandman. Make sure sandman is first and then covert. 
---
same for me
---
You get a mask? I've just been popping balloons all this time and yelling, "squirrel!" on my mic. 
---
Nope, one character has it but unequipped, the other is new, level 3. Curious how far i can take it. All day just been sitting in water and respawning on death, no mutations
---
Didn't know you can buy em, no mic though for my pc, so not sure how to buy from others
---
Yes it is incredibly consitent.  I have never been to Helvetia but I have been to Harpers Ferry and I will say that many elements there are pretty consistent as well.  Though it is MUCH hillier in real life than in the game and while the firehouse museum is there the building that make up the armory location in the game are a musem as the armory was leveled a long time ago and is only a footing now.
---
Haven't even gotten 1
---
I’m starting a new character because I want to get a fresh start and also I couldn’t be f*cked to move my camp to a more secluded area.
---
You monster 
---
*Insert love emote here*
---
Yeah I have several atom shop floors I love to mix and match and I love putting a modern design overhang on my houses and half floor plans are essential to make it look nice.
---
I think that board with take  an AMD Phenom II X4 965 Black Edition, which ain't bad.  
---
Insult Bot came to me in Helvetia and he will follow you relentlessly, casting random insults. Option 1: a note reading "You have been insulted" is deposited into your PipBoy after awhile. Option 2: you get mad and kill him...then the note is in his inventory. 
---
Either way, you got Owned.
---
I own and play on an XBox 1 (also old, bought the day FO4 released) but literally none of my friends play on it, they're all on PC. 😭
---
I am glad, we are friends. &lt;3
---
Yeah, that really sucks. Had it happen once too.
---
I now blueprint everything not attached to the foundation. Crops are a pain (at least on PC) because you have to select just one and then grow the selection to one near it, and that one to the next one, etc. Takes forever.
---
My stupid water hand pump can go to hell though. I just build a new one hoping they've upgraded the model to the Mark IV version.
---
Ol Dirty gums! I’d be happy to help out with some decorating yeah! Shoot me a message 
---
I’ve grinded maybe 100-200 events these past few weeks and haven’t got a single outfit as a reward. What are other people’s averages like to get outfits as rewards from doing events?
---
i would be happy if the game would stop to ctd randomly when I use the favourite wheel.
---
There's a Forest Camo Jumpsuit that's similar to what you're describing in-game
---
Ooooh found a candidate for parent of the year here! 
---
Ya I think most in the apparel in the shop is just terrible,they are trying too hard to look like fortnight or something instead of being true to their own franchise.My atoms just keep building up,because every week it’s the same nonsense. Pink too toos,Wack pants suits etc
---
First in the perk card list? 
---
If we could sell it, caps would be way too easy to come by.  Plain and simple.
---
Kinda wonder how much processing it's been through though, ya know? They couldn't possibly be selling buckets of raw shit.
---
I’m going with Bethesda is planning to sell the masks themselves on the black market for a quick injection of  cash. 
---
I would hope so. My camp in survival is probably going to be the bare basics though, hidden somewhere far from a train station where I only stay a few minutes before dipping out for fear someone will locate it and destroy it
---
Does speed demon do that? It’s the only mutation I have and I assumed not but could be wrong. Definitely didn’t sprint through anyone, no party for me to be connected to.
---
It does not need to be "fixed" it's not broken. It clearly states by taking a work shop you are opening your self up for pvp. You literally have to look at it and click yes to take one. As for wanted traps once again your literally going after another player for pvp, just because they are better or have a team and you do don't get an I win pass its broke? It's the challenge that makes pvp fun. If you want to win 100% of the time and face roll through the game with no challenge or skill play pve.
---
Yeah, no...
---
Thanks for the info. Just starting the game.
---
Here’s hoping for future atom shop pieces. That would cost less than the original 
---
I play all 5 characters. It only takes a week to hit level 50 on each one when its your goal. Most days i only play on maybe 2 or 3 of the accounts. Daily timed events reset.
---
Main advantages: 7k vendor caps available per day. Huge storage space. Different builds. 
---
Main disadvantages: you level up 5x slower and you need 5x the arsenal.
---
10/10 would reccomend leveling all 5 to level 50. I have 2 mules, 1 pvp, 2 well rounded fighters. 
---
You belong in /r/fo76FilthyCasuals with the rest of us non-triggered peeps
---
I've been eyeing the Phenom, but the price is the main reason I shied away, and then the GigaByte website was giving me mixed messages regarding its compatibility. Thanks though, it looks like I'll be going with that one. ❤️
---
Oh yes you are correct. I replied to someone else about this very thing. Dealing with entitlement is so hard, because entitlement is based in emotions and belief, and not facts. 
---
But they see it as fact. I believe this about the world, therefore it's true. Anyone saying differently is attacking my being. 
---
He comes up tells you to halt and then insults you, he then gives you a card telling you that it was a college experiment but unfortunately the card does not tell you what the insult was so of you didnt hear him say it then you wont know what was said. Mine was " Vault Dweller, the 2070's called and would like their vault suite back."
---
Does your friend own the normal cooking stove?
---
The red one is a skin, not an actual item.
---
so you'd rather grind for plans in adventure than to grind in adventure for appropriat gear
---
also you need certain perks to build certain shit. so all low int playerbuilds are fucked 
---
So wherever they are in your active perks. Always have sandman come first and covert after it. Doesn’t matter where. Just in that order. Should hit 3.75x on a sneak 
---
No. You can pacify it, but you cannot tame a diseased hive mind. Basically you can't tame zombies.
---
Saw him at the random encounter spot on road 65 (where you can find the Trick-or-Treater with the witch costume plan). Only saw him there once tho. 
---
Or wear a hazmat suit. Thats my go to when server hopping White Springs. 
---
Such is the downfall of the rich man. Caps cometh, caps taken. 
---
Higher Level = More time played, more gear found.
---
Higher Level = More Maxed out Perk Cards and a better "finely tuned" build.
---
All Levels over 50 are EndGame, but not all are equal. 
---
It’s going to be a fresh start forever, because everyone with duped items will have to start over. Letting people bring their duped items into new modes simply bleeds that issue over. Yes, you’re right, after a few weeks the survival hype will die down and people will get their builds set up, and the playing field won’t be level any more. But that’s not really why characters being locked to modes is important... it’s the duped items ruining any sense of competition. Why would I play a competitive mode when I know people will be there who cheated their way to being powerful? 
---
&gt; Not everyone plays for hours everyday. Not everyone can grind new characters out. Not everyone has friends that want to play in Survival too.
---
If you don’t have the time or motivation to play the new game mode, it doesn’t really make sense to compromise the entire point of the mode just so you can have your cake and eat it too. Survival is, essentially, pvp mode. Cheating has already been a huge issue in the primarily pve base game, and letting it seep into pvp mode is a big mistake imo. And if that means that people who don’t have time to play the game don’t get to spend time playing the game... what’s the issue with that? 
---
This ^^ its only a variant not a standalone item in the item shop, youll still need the plans for the original dirty version
---
If someone was standing in the doorway, would the Brahmin knock them out of it?
---
&gt; The dupes are gone.
---
No they're not. Stacks of dupes are gone, the ones that got distributed are still there. Tens of thousands of dupes were distributed, so that's a pretty big fucking issue.
---
&gt; Ah, so you know how much free time my schedule allows for too? You sure know a lot about me for someone who's never met me or even spoken to me before. Are you stalking me?
---
Look. I'm glad you don't have to work and don't have any bills to pay, and can sit around and grind for 12+ hours a day, but not all of us are so lucky.
---
Ahhh the irony. Are you this stupid all the time?
---
&gt; Try talking to me when you have some actual responsibilities in life.
---
I'm 32, I'd wager I have just as many responsibilities as you, perhaps more. I'm just through the phase of my life where I had to work 18 hours a day to get somewhere.
---
I don't mean to alarm you but if you think human shit isn't being sprayed on fields in the United States you are mistaken. Communities sell their solid waste for just such enterprises all the time, it's just not something that gets made a big deal of. 
---
What platform are you on? I have the door and am on XB1
---
That would be lovely and a good idea.
---
Find some good runs that give lots of XP.
---
Anywhere with lots of supermutants is good , in fact anywhere with lots of mobs can help.
---
I’m level 87 and can still level up every day or 2 days if I only play for a couple of hours
---
Depends. What's your favorite dinosaur?
---
You might be bugged or something. As far as I can tell I'm at the max that you can get without using chems or food for temporary bonuses
---
These past few days I haven't been able to make stimpacks for my guild. All of my water is gone. My camp is a very short walk from Helvetia . I leave two unlocked and two locked . Players spit on that kindness by picking the locks and stealing my water. My turrets never attack a lock picker. So some of the lower levels in my guild haven't been logging on the last two days because they depend on my water supply. 
---
You think you are stealing from a level 220, no big deal. But you are actually hurting those that I help. So please think twice before stealing water , I have two unlocked for passerby. Don't steal from locked ones. There is usually a reason it's locked. 
---
Fair enough, I just discovered the taming system recently and was unsure of it's limits.
---
Wes-tek and watoga robot runs for legendaries works for me.
---
Yeah it looks awful tbh. It's the same camo as the combat armor camo in the shop, as well as the camo suit. Legitimately looks like wal-mart camo.
---
I too have been insulted. Didn't see or hear a thing, and then a notification came up saying Note added: You have been insulted.
---
Checked my notes and sure enough there it was.
---
The note itself is interesting because it says something about being a prototype. 
---
Are we EVER gonna get a fix for the level scaling BS? It really ruins the game. 
---
I work in a creative field. I often talk to people about how and what it takes to be a professional illustrator, and more importantly, I critique peoples work and provide feedback.
---
There's criticism. There's constructive criticism and then there's complaining.
---
This forum has way more of the complaining. And a fair amount of that complaining goes well into obnoxious and abusive. 
---
Example, people often say the game is unplayable. That's a complaint and a criticism but it's not constructive. And it's also not true from a general point. It's only unplayable by what they want out of a game. Clearly, the game is playable. So what value does that criticism give the Devs? More so if the person never says what it is about the game that turns them off. Because that's what's really being said. The game mechanics are a turn off for them. 
---
Here's an example. Back when the stash box was 400. One guy wanted an increase because he wanted to hoard bobble heads. He had 20. They are one pound each. A stash limit increase is valid. But if it's to just hoard bobble heads, that's where things get harder to assess. Since bobble heads are unlimited in this game, compared to FO4, there will never be a big enough stash for that player, because he will keep hoarding bobble heads as he finds them. 
---
What there's a lot of in this forum is the kind of criticism that doesn't do much to help the devs understand. Another large section are people that like certain things over other things. We all have personal preferences, and the devs actually try and accommodate as much as they can. But going in one direction often limits the ability to go in another direction.
---
This game really did put a stronger emphasis on grouping over solo play. Which was very risky, since the built in Fallout Fan base is used to single player games. As such, when you play solo, you have to do a little more work and maintenance, like managing perks, if you just can't bring yourself to pass up every locked container, but also have other Perception perks that matter to you. 
---
So it's not that people that have criticism about the game are villians. It's more how they present those. I have criticisms about the game. 
---
I want them to clean up the names for all the plans. Some are still to vague. Since Cooking Oil is now and ingredient in making fasnacht donuts, shouldn't they have remembered to remove it from the auto scrap? Perk decks should have been a thing from the start. 
---
All of these I've posted about. But not with rants and raves and insults and accusations and weird conspiracies ideas.
---
Also, I don't see in any other reddit forum for this game, people literally bragging how they drove out anyone that expressed something good about the game. I mean, look around, every few days, you'll see someone ask why saying something good about the game gets downvoted and people have to call you names. 
---
Again, you don't see that in other forums about this game. 
---
Those cost a fortune!
---
Look at your scrap totals. You might way more of a specific one. 
---
For the longest I had over 5k and steel and didn’t notice. 
---
&gt; Except all those stacks of duped weapons were deleted.
---
The stacks were deleted, yes. But the tens of thousands of dupes that were distributed to the mass over several months? Those are all still around.
---
&gt; Aaaaaand that doesn't change the fact that within two weeks the leaderboards will be filled with players who have tons of TSE and god-tier equipment anyhow. It won't be "balanced" then, either.
---
If it gets reset, then it'll take a few months for this to happen. You're severely underestimating the amount of time it takes to farm up god-tier equipment. Even for people who do nothing but play games for 12 hours a day.
---
I like this. Two questions:
---
1. Why Martial Artist vs say Blocker? Do you really use melee much? I would think the 30% damage protection might be nicer than the melee speed but perhaps you have one heavy melee weapon to clean up things or when out of ammo?
---
2. No concentrated fire on Endurance line for VATS? I would think you might want to target the wings on SBQ or heads on other folks?
---
 I don't have a heavy build so more discussion type questions than any real knowledge. Thanks.
---
I suspect they have more faction stuff planned in the future, so they're holding off on it.  I am sure as the game progresses we will see more faction related items and content -- it is after all a huge part of Fallout, and I am sure they are not blind to it.
---
Yeah you can save them but you have to hook up a separate storage unit to get them off and then onto a computer
---
Nuka grape also removes rads. It can be bought from Bubbles at the White Springs. 
---
We actually don't. We make up things to talk about, then vote which one we like the best, and that's what we talk about during the week. Then we repeat that all over again. 
---
Yeah bit what I'm saying is it's usually processed, it's not straight from the septic tank. 
---
Okay well they're not doing it that way so I'm bringing my character over to survival
---
It has no BOS flair at all.
---
I would suggest Deathclaw,  or Mirelurk King for your camp. Both are bosses.
---
Then rush up the stairs, along the corridor through the secret entrance into the Enclave bunker, 
---
Do you actually take damage? I thought it was just playing the "takes damage" grunt as the rads leave... never actually seen my HP bar go down.
---
Legendary Headwear
---
Teams, and that charisma card that gives you more xp when on a team.
---
I ran into him during Fasnacht. He said something like 'please wait, generating insult' and then it took awhile before he came back with something like 'want to improve Appalachia, try nuking vault 76 for a good start.' The funniest part was after that he said, in his broken robotic English, something like 'contacting local burn unit'. I seriously lol'd. 
---
It's still happening. 
---
You can't, either you server hop until you find it or you wait until it starts.
---
Helps to have friends. My Community just server hops until one of us have an Event, then we pile in to that server. Try adding some people?
---
A couple of times I misjudged the timing ;)
---
Biv is a terrible example to let your babybots grow up to be.
---
Also I feel like that would incentivize people to further cheese the build system. 
---
Go to Harper's ferry free states vendor but they are expensive tho
---
Wait were you with 2 others last night at the ammo factory ?  With deathclaw gauntlets?...
---
It’s more just the sound of them picking up a target. I’m not worried about turrets doing the dirty work. I just don’t want someone to sneak within range, know what I mean?
---
k
---
Honestly, I've never even joined a team in my entire playthrough, I should look into that.
---
This is a good go to. Shoot vertibirds down every time you see them. Great experience with zero risk.
---
I saw a paper bag blowing across the parking lot and almost stopped to check the contents...
---
I’m on XB1 too, what do you want for it??
---
Probably not me then. I have only been nuking players and bots.
---
I mean I addressed that in my comments about duping and being able to buy gear on the marketplace and thru player vending once that becomes a thing. 
---
I guess one thing I failed to consider and I’ll add it into the post is the new prestige system as I’ll definitely be prestiging my higher lvl characters anyways. Thanks for the input tho!
---
I'm there. 
---
Rare masks don’t exist. Go ahead, end my pathetic existence. I’m done
---
The optimist in me wants to think that way. This game launched in November and there really isn't the volume of content that I was expecting.
---
I always have trouble keeping enough ammo on me for large adventures. For my level 60 perk I chose the ammosmith, which should help, but for some reason, I'm always low on steel.
---
LOL!
---
There isn't a turret in the game that can out range a long-scoped rifle. I'm thinking you build your perimeter wall, put the turrets on a switch and mount them on the INSIDE of the walls. Draw em in, make think the turrets are napping, then all at once... (probably won't work without some sort of bunker for the switch...). 
---
You win some and you loose some. Kinda like real life lol. 
---
Yeah I’ve made some camp blueprints that are about mobile defense and functionality for this mode. No need for frills. 
---
How do you mean?
---
Ah I see, thanks!
---
Dont buy it used. Codes will likely be bogus. Buy it new. Its cheaper than ever. Id give you mine but i used the code. Its pretty easy to find a cheap copy. Most places were trying to give it away damn near free. Never buy a code off ebay unless its unopened. I bout the Tricentennial edition for 80... Wish i would have waited. 
---
Does regular armor stack with PA?
---
F
---
found the mask AGES ago.
---
First off, this isn't an mmo. It's more akin to ark rust or perhaps even if you do want to go down the mmo route, the division.
---
Second, duped gear being baseline is bullshit. You're making excuses for people who have taken part in exploiting the system like it doesn't matter now because in the future they **might** role out better top end gear. Even if they did, who gives a shit, they'd have to drastically change how mobs work and add in mobs way harder for the SBQ for new gear to truly make a difference here. You're way too naive, just because they add in new more powerful weapons doesn't make the current ones less OP. They're still just as strong, still just as capable of 1 shotting 99% of mobs and players.
---
Rare as rare does there should never be a garrantee for a rare item
---
Oh and i dont know what "bonus codes"  are but mine only came with one. The main one. Thats it. The special items are in game you dont need a code to unlock them. At least i didn't. 
---
Excellent rebuttal, I’m glad we could even attempt to have a reasonable conversation. Have a great day.
---
You can always do the "just fucking run" option, too. And don't take junk with you, so if you die it doesn't matter. 
---
No, I don't think so. Once something dies the physics of it go wonky... has no real weight. The only thing a corpse seems to interact with is other corpses and loose objects like desk fans and the like.
---
WoW raid/dungeon mounts are always 1% for latest boss, 4% for mid raid mount bosses. Events don't follow this rule, there are events like halloween that have a 1%, others like Love is in the Air that have 0.03%, in fact the Big Love Rocket is still one of the rarest mounts in game, because you have an abysmal chance 14 days per year.. I know people doind that with 50 characters per account without luck. Every year.
---
The more you know, the more it crawls into your brain.  The more its vines entwine around your mind. 
---
Then the Firstborn of the Wood will mark you as His, and His Blood will shelter you. 
---
I can usually server hop and have it in 5-10 min. It resets hourly as well. Not super hard to get into. 
---
The kicker is when you fail one b/c the group in whole has no idea what they are doing. I server hopped last night to have this happen to me. We couldnt find the last robot.
---
Everyone can do it but they still haven't fixed the level scaling? Bethesda Austin is utterly terrible.  All I've wanted to do is PLAY THE GAME. It's been almost 5 months and the game still has day 1 bugs. This is what they get for giving a studio that specializes in MTX games a fallout title. 
---
yeah she does and she can't place that one either, I've also had issues with the vault tec bed and the whitespring signs 
---
Honestly I will just wait for community feedback and than decide shall I join survival or not. 
---
Friend or ex friend?
---
I’ll sink some of your caps for you I’ve never been over 2k caps and I’m lv 74 lmfao 
---
If there’s normalization then maybe this won’t be bad but there are pros and cons to both having it and not. 
---
Then let's make it stupid simple. If you kill a level 68 3star legendary scorched do you want the same reward as a level 68 1star scorched. I mean, they are both endgame and have the same potential for gear, right? You are not punished for being a higher level, you become the TARGET for low levels in this system of cap / reward. It is intentional and the same mechanic as legendary.
---
It helps if you ha e a friend to play with. I've been on 3 stranger teams 2 we're great the other just wanted free stuff. My friend and I though team all the time and have a great time.
---
Stop encouraging MTX when the game is still a mess. 
---
Honestly, xp farming nuke zones before they nerfed it... but still easy. Kill and quest.
---
It sounds good. Only problem is with the influx for farming and at fast rate it’ll just cause more damage. This would work well if there was an internal timer preventing spamming. 
---
I was even thinking of a item of the day thing. The vendor asks for say a 1 Star executioner’s weapon and in turn it/he/they can give a two star and chance x. 
---
**Build:**

---
The main build is slotted in, and all the crafting stuff / melee swap is on the swap out cards. 
---
**Mutations:**
---
Adrenal Reaction
---
Marsupial
---
Speed Demon
---
Carnivore
---
There are others you can take as well, but they are situational. Those are the big 4 that pretty much anyone would want with this build.
---
**Weapons**
---
A single star bloodied variant of either the .50 cal Machine gun (max dps, can be costly to maintain ammo for though) or the Gatling Gun (less dps, but extremely ammo efficient, can one shot bloated glowing ghouls and max level super mutants, still does good dps on SBQ). The Gatling Laser and Gatling Plasma are also options, but only once they fix armor penetration on energy weapons. Stabilized perk card and Anti-Armor don't currently work on energy weapons. They are at least aware of this issue now (finally), so I'd say look for a fix on those in the coming month or two. Gatling Plasma is also very very ammo efficient, but only suitable for sustained DPS in my opinion due to the spinup time. If you're crafting Plasma Cores, make sure to max out your int at 20 (max for crafting) to get overcharged cores, which can give you up 350 shots per core instead of 250. Especially if you're making Prime Plasma cores!
---
**Armor**
---
Go with whatever power armor floats your boat. Calibrated shocks, and maybe most importantly, Emergency Protocols on the chest. Emergency Protocols gives you 50% DR when below 20% HP, which will be at all times.
---
**Consumables**
---
Managing your health is the biggest pain with this build. The best way to do that is by keeping your rads at 81% of your HP, meaning that you can never heal past 19% HP. This will ensure that you're getting max damage through Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction, and Bloodied.
---
If you're at full hp, just hop out of your power armor and gather some dirty water. You'll get down to 19% hp pretty quickly. For managing your health in the field, you'll want...
---
**Ionized Meat**. Found from nuked enemies fairly commonly. Doing circuits of Whitesprings will get you lots. With Carnivore, you get 80% food from this as well, and no disease chance.
---
**Purified Water**. Kind of a no brainer. Drink when thirsty. I have 8 large water purifiers at my base. When I go back after a few hours of farming, they're full, and I never need to worry about water.
---
**Psychotats**. Probably the most useful chem for this build, since Pyschobuff messes up your hp - your hp goes above your rad bar and the only way to get it to come down is if it wears off or you take a ton of damage. I only use these for SBQ.
---
**Diluted Stimpacks** \- Make sure you use Super Duper and Chemist perk to craft these. You'll be swimming in them and never need to actually hunt for them. Just normal farming will yield plenty. You only need to heal 15% of your HP or so at very most, and these will do the job just fine.
---
**Diluted Radaway** \- Only needed to be used in nuke zones really. Again, you'll be swimming in these if you farm nuked whitesprings.
---
**Ballistic Bock** \- Alcohol from Biv daily. Currently bugged, doesn't work for heavy weapons (why Bethesda!!!). adds 15% ballistic damage. 
---
For reference, I one shot most common max level enemies with the gatling gun. Max level glowing / scorched mirelurk queens, kings, fog crawlers, etc., evaporate when using this build with the .50 Cal Machine Gun. I can take down SBQ in less than 1,000 .50 Cal rounds even if 8 other people are there not really contributing. The only thing better than this for pve dps would be an Unyielding Bloodied Meathook / power fist build. The downside of those builds is that you need to take off power armor and you likely WILL die in one hit unless you have unyielding / sentinel gear. Those builds can theoretically do about 2x the dps of this build, however, they can't get the queen to land and stay landed. This build will cripple the queen quickly and force her to land. In theory you could even use the perk swap mod and keep a full set of unyielding gear on you, get her to land and cripple her with the heavy weapons build, then swap in a bloodied swing speed meat hook and unyielding gear to decimate her once she lands.

Are you able to craft an assaultron helmet? I’ve hunted down so many Watoga assaultrons, but have yet to get the helmet plan from scrapping their heads. Fml.

---
I'm not basically calling you a liar, I'm flat out calling you full of bullshit. I've got shitloads of time in this game and in this forum. I've seen very very very very little griefing and evidence of it happening to others. Instead I see and do **lots** of people helping and offering help to each other and those who're struggling.

First internet post to make me lol in real life in a long time . 2nd that
---
That happens to me all the time! I think they get more nervous the higher the level you are, which I totally understand. Even level 60 is intimidating when you’ve barely cracked level 10. High levels are either really good or really bad and it’s hard to tell which one you’ve encountered at first.
---
Fallout 76 is ass mate, will have to wait ages till it’s a clean game. If that happens at all. I still have the glitch where enemies health doesn’t go down.  I was trying to enter belching Betty mine to complete fire breather quest and it kept crashing.  Hopefully Bethesda sorts the game out. 
---
I had a similar idea, but it would be tied to your stash and it would filter all perishables. That way you don't have to move anything, just build it in your camp and it starts working. Either way, it's a great idea. 
---
Ok, this is the new metric on which I base friendship. 
---
(Mine is triceratops, btw.)  
---
The “scrap” scares me. What if it scraps the items in question and forces us to find specific parts to make it our selves. 
---
I've had this happen plenty unfortunately. My only advise is to play on the server for a while, before going nuclear. Does interacting with objects lag? Enter an area and see enemies drop dead for no reason? Time to hop servers, run those checks again, if things seem normal, give it a go.
---
Try and always find someone to team with. If you crash you can join back to the same world with ease.
---
Really? Wow, I had no idea. That’s poor.
---
Are there other third party DVR options..?
---
Because it was a train wreck. It was made by a new studio that clearly is incapable of handling a game of this type. 5 months in and the level scaling is still fucked. There are day 1 bugs still everywhere. They seemingly have no testing team whatsoever. They just throw broken updates out. Bethesda Maryland should have been making this game, not some MTX specialist studio in Austin. 
---
Remember the whole one foundation supports many floors not supported by walls issue. That. 
---
What a wonderful idea! That’s an incredible thing to do, especially considering how costly the plans will be following the event.
---
Old article but I've been getting this nonstop, it only started with the nukashine patch which is frustrating, a quick fix that works most of the time is changing your shadows to ultra and then restarting the game and changing them to high and restarting again, it's really annoying but it does seem to help me.
---
Lol I'll come on for hire as someone who follows you around and carries your stuff. I've never been over maybe 500 caps lol. I'm only level 40 though. 
---
Adderall?
---
Cocaine?
---
Most likely combined with a pair of Depends.
---
Pretty sure I have one in my stash I can give to you!
---
If you interact with other you should get a note titled "You've been insulted" I haven't actually looked at the note itself. I totally spaced, but I plan to check when I hop on in an hour
---
&gt; No, you'll get that finger the fuck out of my face and stop wagging it now.
---
Grrr, I'm big and I can be scawwy on an anonymous internet forum. I get to tell people what to do not the other way around.. Rawr, be afraid of me, I am big boy.
---
The real issue is caps aren’t worth anything in the game.You should reconsider taking caps in trade,theres really not much use for them after buying plans and they pretty much rain from the sky in this game.
---
You are misunderstanding the problem. There are 5 masks probably everyone has already. Then there are 5 masks with a mythologicaly tiny chance of rolling. 
---
Well a great many server hops tonight didn't change the vendor inventory at all, it was identical and with the lights plan.
---
Looks like I'm going hunting for Graham. I did however get the Greek characters from Biv before I started my hops so silver lining. 
---
Ahh I had stopped playing for a bit while that was going on. I completely forgot about it.🙂
---
Heyo! If you ever catch me again drop by and say “hi”. I’ll help you out with resources if you need them. 
---
Your post is the EXACT reason they do it. Try not letting every person on the internet control your emotions. It's all just pixels on a screen.
---
Just play another 40 hours today and you’ll get there. 
---
Good luck with that.  Sarcasm aside, just do laps around the golf course tagging enemies. 
---
Find a high level group and do nuke zone a lot
---
I think that argument is a little disingenuous, PvE and PvP are two totally separate scenarios. 
---
I just don’t see the difference between me killing a lvl 100 player and a lvl 100 character killing me, we both have our builds “fine tuned” and yet I have to kill them 2.5x as much as they kill me to break even. 
---
After writing it all out and posting it I realized that the new prestige system will fix this issue so I thank you for your comments, although I do think they’re a little misleading when you try to compare PvE and PvP, a ghouls not taking my caps lol. Thanks for the input tho! 
---
It'll be years before they solve this issue. Bethesda Austin are terrible at developing this game. 
---
Lol, I'll give it to you, you're way more mature about this than I am. That guy is fucking hilarious, I can't help but taunt him and all the irony dripping from his comments.
---
I'll take a look
---
I am more concerned about Bethesda secretly and slowly nerfing everything to do with my PVP centric build. No more additional critical hits for automatic weapons; no more vats targeting on crouched opponents.
---
Caps are not too big a deal, I feel. I understand some people abused an exp glitch to get themselves up over level 500. They kinda deserve to lose 1k caps at that point.
---
See, I don't think that all perishables should be affected, the container definitely needs a max item number like how the fermentor has 10
---
Cause Bethesda Austin has no idea what they're doing. 
---
My tip is to not rush through leveling. Do some exploring and side missions while completing the main story
---
No one noticed it says "Beta" on the front of it.... Beta means things can still change. 
---
I was playing GTA 5 again for a first time in w while and damn did they add some fun things to the apartments. I never knew I wanted my fo76 character to shower until I remembered that you can do it in GTA 5. It'd be nice to add some creature comforts like that in fo76.
---
No one said the food is non rotting. I clearly said it slows the decay time.
---
Its bugged. walk about 20-30 ft away then come back and you can search the box then. Works 100% of the time for me.
---
You can get 1400 caps every day by spending 15 minutes hitting up all the vendors.
---
I did the exact same thing with my outhouse and the cardboard cut out. You are obviously a man of good taste!
---
ok thanks
---
I was just talking with someone about this minutes ago. We need something but not a huge thing. Say 10 or so pounds of food/drink. No scraps or others just food. 
---
Best of all atom shop skins. Win-win for everyone. 
---
YOOOO! I definitely appreciated the help! I usually have a mic but I’m out of town right now so I’m keeping it off at night. I think I have just about all of the plans from the parade at this point, except for the lantern pole and the mounted flags. Feel free to join up on me anytime! I’ve got plenty of resources to give you should you need them. :)
---
I have so much of all kind of ammo in my stash. I use 308, 44 and 10. I'm to the point i don't always pick up the one i don't use. I really hope to be able to sell them when player vending drop.
---
Sometimes I wonder though, if our lives are really more valuable than theirs. You know?
---
Yes.
---
If I really wanted to PVP, I'd make a new character to level to about 65 and only play on that character when I was PVPing. I'd do all of my practicing on my main--level 208, atm.
---
Assuming that I'm not an undiscovered genius who came up with a really novel way to minimize caps losses, why shouldn't we assume that other players also have PVP builds that they know how to play from already, and recognize that there should be a ceiling to the amount of caps you can lose?
---
I think 15 items would be a nice sustainable amount
---
Not that I am aware of.
---
I got that from the nuclear plant for defending it. You could try that.
---
Mine is brontosaurus, but some scientists^^ claimed he didn't exist :(
---
I know. I just like hobbling them better. 🙂 My enemies are unworthy of quick deaths.
---
Yeah I just played the game a lot lol. I remember there being that Battle Bot glitch and thinking about the PvP implications at the time, I never participated in XP glitches just enjoyed questing. I had too much fun on this character to stop leveling and now feel like that was a little bit of a mistake as I’ve been anticipating survival mode for quite a while. 
---
Right?? It would be a nice change. You can usually pick up a mod on the scorchbeast queen though! I don’t know if you know this or not
---
How much can a mini fridge hold in weight? Keeping mind the bulky fallout design. 5-10 would be better. 
---
I’ll definitely check it out when I get on! I’d always wondered if there was a difference, but hadn’t studied them enough to tell. 
---
Well there a lot of voice filles gimme a min
---
You are a LEGEND!
---
I begged people to help me complete the "Sell an item to another player" daily challenge. I offered lucrative bounties. I got the cold shoulder. WTF. 
---
Also, well said OP. This event is hella fun. 
---
See, I'm picturing something like what the butcher has in the parade event
---
Why not just go play the game, and do the event when it pops up?
---
Lol I came across him too, scared me at first "HALT" The other bot that screams you won and he's been looking for me has had the worst timing lol..
---
I’m sure there are options but not out-of-the-box, as you might expect...
---
Anytime. Drop your GT and I'll gladly take some Caps with my level 230 and not complain one bit if you beat me. Good luck to you not losing so much...
---
The secret unethical Vault experiment was the friends we made along the way! 
---
Ok then. Whats so special about those masks besides their rarity?

You can actually stick the electrical sign on the nuclear generator, as a heads up.

I had two stuck in black loading screens today and just shut it off. I like the fallout series and enjoy playing 76 but the bugs/connection problems have wore me down. It's better than it was but thats not saying much 
---
Had same thing happen I’m on PS4 dude was server hopping and shooting mini nukes at damn super mustants 
---
Yeah that’s not really what this post was about but I appreciate your enthusiasm it definitely makes for vibrant discussions!
---
What is tagging enemies? Is that just slang for using vats? 
---
Literally nothing. But if you do manage to get one it's basically a blank check for any trade you could possibly want. 
---
At that size it better take a chunk of your budget with it. 
---
The garage door plan spawns on the ground (on the concrete) by silo Charlie. 
---
The garage door plan can be had free - it's on the ground between the main building and the garage (I think R&amp;G ?) at Silo Charlie. If it's not there, server hop, it will be there.
---
I’ve been running the Parade event ad infinum, killing time by asking people locally to tell me their best jokes. I tell ‘em, “If you can get me chuckling, I’ll give you 500c.” Handed out maybe 4000c so far, give or take. Bad jokes, dad jokes, and everything in between, have a few on hand; never know if our paths will cross.
---
There's a pink tutu?!
---
SOLD!
---
Yeah at the end or wolves it’s random 
---
I felt the exact same way till I started constantly hitting max caps. Now I feel like it's a benefit it temps more people into trying to farm me. It really is currently hard to find pvp in this game, I'll take it even if they are only after my caps. What concerns me more are the intentional low cap pvpers. They have everything to gain and nothing to lose literally. 
---
This kind of shit is exactly what I was trying to avoid.
---
Don't put more than 3 points into any SPECIAL (so total 4) and you can still decide which direction you want to take your build once you have some levels under your belt.
---
The Robots of Watoga in fact morph into legendaries, too bad this post was removed because of lazy trolls, but maybe it's for the better, the trolls don't deserve this info anyways.

You are encouraged to keep any Legendary you have if you want to trade them. We will have more information on the Legendary Vendor and Scrapping closer to that release. Most likely in an Inside the Vault.
---
If it's on XBOX could be the 500 atoms
---
Oh boy, you sure told me! I'll just change my opinion right now!
---
Last time I checked, you weren't among the official Bethesda staff, so how the hell do you even know that people have it "wrong"?
---
Go be bossy somewhere else.
---
No, it just means you hit them one time and let higher level players kill them. If you hit them one time you get the exp and loot.
---
I stabbed him on accident :( 
---
I bought the power Armour edition for £275... I regret it too, wish I just got base game

Not to mention, having just a few water purifiers in your base will make this happen quite easily. I run five small ones and collect regularly. On top of that, I use Herbivore + Melons, and as such, I don’t really have a need for water in general. Might have 500 Purified on me at all times.

I just had no one show up at all for the event.

There are hundreds of people with stories like this, I've done the event 20+ times, 10-20 players were there every time, I've not seen a rare mask.

I was more implying about faction population imbalance rather than trying to say that that it wasn't a near constant 2v1.

As much as you told me and changed my opinion. 
---
Last tone i checked I wasn’t either and made no such claim.
---
I love how bossy you’re being and yet lack any self perception.
---
Please keep going on it’s hilarious your attempts.
---
Yeah a part of this post is probably me being greedy about my caps lol, I can definitely understand why the system functions how it does currently. I do think Bethesda has recognized that it gets a little out of hand once you’re past lvl 300 tho and that’s part of the reasoning behind the prestige system. 
---
I definitely agree with your concern about zero cap PvP exploiters, hopefully Bethesda has figured out a better system than just -50% damage because it really ruins the fun of PvP for me.
---
Weird ok, but flex
---
Well.. in the end ungratefuls are whining :)
---
Oh shit wow I never knew that that happened, thanks for telling me my dude
---
tbh, I probably wouldn't.  The Phenom is still hugely overpriced.  The FX8350 8 core is cheap and outperforms it.  
---
It's AM3+ architecture.
---
Just play the game for the next 24 hours.  I recommend diapers with your time frame.  Dont rush the game man.  Thats not the purpose.  Immerse yourself with the game.  
---
To the top comment:  ideas are worthless, execution is what matters.
---
Leader boards are a huge component for a certain types of player, and from early on this game has tried to draw in all 4 types of players.  (Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, and Killers.). 
---
Thankyou for telling me, I didn’t know haha
---
💪
---
"We?" If you server hop for the event don't you know where everyone is by now? I've only done the parade maybe eight times, and I'm confident I could get it started with one other person. On my own, if it'd spawn (ha) enough eggs.

---
Wow. Hundreds you say. Well that’s certain the clincher isn’t it!
---
No problem, happy to share.
---
If you can do it with a buddy. That way once you find him you can take turns hopping on and off the server. Each time one of you comes back in his inventory will change, pretty much guaranteeing you will eventually get what you want. The Responder Bot that walks around works the same way if you are ever searching for something like the Hunters Longcoat.
---
no way to verify but i use a furious handmade and that seems about right
---
I've noticed something fishy going on with the map and compass too. I'd try to orient my direction by looking where I wanted to go on the map, but I'd walk a short way, look again, and somehow I had gone the complete wrong direction. I didn't know if something was bugged, or if I was just being an idiot somehow.
---
I guess I don't understand who made you or any other reddit user judge and jury about whether or not somebody has a valid criticism (or complaint to use your vernacular).  To a degree, you're judging other people's critiques as complaining because you either don't agree with the complaint or you don't agree with its merit.  Look at your example.
---
So what if a guy wants a bigger stash to store a bunch of bobble heads.  You and I don't have to agree with it for it to be a user story.  In fact I disagree that he needs even one bobble head because their benefit is meh at best.  But he paid for the game, and that's what he wants.  As you alluded to, the product owners will decide if it merits development or not.  Not every suggestion will come to bear fruit, but let them be made.  I would also agree with you that not storing a million bobbleheads doesn't make the game unplayable, but hey, maybe for that guy, it does.  I don't know.
---
I definitely understand that there are plenty of people delivering criticism in the form of complaining or ranting, but that doesn't make it not relevant.  Every bit of feedback can lead to something (even if that something wasn't the goal of the feedback).  The only time I consider criticism irrelevant is when, as you point out, people get personal.  Insulting others doesn't help prove a point.  
---
Disagreement is okay...  For example, I disagree with you they made this a more group based game than single player one.  I think they actually made it more half and half (at best), and that is a big driver for many of their ongoing headaches.  However, I won't beat that dead horse here.
---
Regardless, I digress, I too work in a creative field and soliciting feedback is one of my primary jobs.  To do that effectively, I often have to wheedle through plenty of complaining to get to the meat of the feedback.  My point is that a good community team would find a way to work with the complainers to sift useful feedback from the complaining like a prospector sifting for gold.  Video games attract all types, and nobody knows that better than developers.  As the old saying goes, if you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen.  You may write more constructively than some, but you're trained to do so.  Don't hold it against them that they are not.  
---
And if they seem over the top sometimes, who cares?  Passion is a good thing.  Sure it gets annoying, but it shows that deep down, they want the product to work!
---
TL; DR - All feedback is good feedback unless it includes personal attacks.  A good community team would navigate through all the complaining and ranting to determine the strengths and weaknesses of their product and set their road-map accordingly.  Reddit isn't a place for just professional video game critics, so we really shouldn't expect everybody to write professional reports/reviews.  As you say, people need to chill (but it isn't just "complainers).
---
It would need to take no more than the fermentor. It is the same size of a stash box
---
Why not use the Xbox one basic headset that comes with the unit? Same as the Sony, only 1 ear..

i can agree. my sentinel gear ive accumulated over like 3 months now. if i started fresh, you would want to build marine/combat armor.

I like it. Toads are meh enemies.

Ah I see, thanks.

Have had a few buddies talking about how to fix the issue: we’d love to see gambling added in communal areas. Black Jack, Slot Machines, whatever. Have the winning prizes be rare/ultra-rare Plans (cosmetic, CAMP). One of the guys even mocked up an underground Casino run by Mole Miners, with rock/ground/earth theme to it all. Unique beverages and recipes found only there. Giving that they’re miners, you can also wager ores/metals (because those, too, are quickly becoming obsolete).

Go into any thread talking about this, there are hundreds of people saying the same thing. Is there a single video of someone recieving any of these masks?

Lol. Judging is what being human is about.

And can feel kinda weird if your the only one talking .....
---
&gt; One person did a one day poll, and then concluded there was only a .03% chance of a rare mask. The data in that poll is not accurate, can't be verified, and so any results from it, are wrong. But people are using it to push their own views and opinions. Which is basically, give us a rare mask, because we want it.
---
You are assuming that the chance is different based on whether it is the first day or any other day of the event while in truth with such a mechanic the only thing that matters is sample size, as in how many runs of the events one did. Regardless of whether it is the first day or not.
---
And people not getting a mask in more than 50 or so events, using a lot of server hopping while the even clearly was intended to be able to be done once every hour and not just one after another, means that the drop rates are just absurdly low which can not be justified. If one assumes 50 runs meaning 50 hours of gameplay since server hopping clearly can not and should not ever be an intended part of gameplay, that means in an entire business weak of playing you dont get a fucking mask to drop and that is fucking insane. Do you get that ?
---
Now get off your high horse and stop sucking your own dick. 
---
Either you dont understand statistics, cant come to a logical conclusion from data or are just unwilling to accept that the design of this event whether it is by its spawn timer or its drop rates is just flawed.
---
Maybe yellow is an industry standard for prototype?

if your on PS4 add me alternon_command I have a shop next to Whitesprings station and love to meet other traders 
---
HA!  I called that 8 months ago.  They love to bitch about the last game.

Fallout (n-1) was great, but DAE Fallout (n) just SUCKS?!
---
I was server hopping last night and I couldn't start two of the parades because the MC was stuck in the bridge and you couldn't speak to him at all.
---
Well, there's almost a THOUSAND people that agree with me. And the post even go 3 awards! So if you are using your standards of how many people say something. I win. I have more than you do. Thanks for playing. 
---
Yes, please fix this! I have this problems, though I don't have multiple versions in the wheel. For example I have two handmade rifles. The wheel always reverts to the one I only use on occasion. The worst part is there is no easy way (that I know of) when I select the weapon in wheel position 3, which handmade I am actually using. Am I missing something, or does the UI not tell you which weapon you are currently using without going into the Pipboy inventory system?
---
If this is you play whatever you want, then Bethesda would run into copyright issues
---
You dont find insult bot, he finds you. 
---
I do the parade once or twice a day just to have fun and see what kinds of drops I can get to decorate my camp. The masks while awesome don’t protect from toxic stuff and so I would not wear them much. Does that mean I don’t wish I could get the Owl mask? No, but it does mean that I understand that it isn’t the end of the world if I don’t get it. This is supposed to become an annual event. This means they will either be the same masks next year or a new set every year to have fun collecting and trading with friends.
---
I swear to god if they put radcentepedes in this game....
---
Nope! There is a legit way to get stuck inside!
---
That sucks.  It won't even support the FX6300.  You could probably dump the MB and go with a new MB and CPU cheaper than going Phenom.
---
If you happen to run the Targeting HUD and or the Chem that marks enemies, get rid of it. I don’t know if they ever fixed the issue properly, but a month or two back, there was a bug that would overload your CPU, causing a crash, due to your Targeting HUD interacting with other player’s. Effectively, your HUD would mark the enemies and ALL players around you: no big deal, right? But if another player were around, their HUD would remark the enemies and players. Yours, seeing that the enemies and players were NOT marked by you, would remark them. Back and forth, back and forth. Happened most prominently at Queen fights due to the massive amount of adds and other players.
---
Throw some vacuum tubes and exposed mechanical bits on it and good
---
It's got to be a new bug. If they are  crouched with a chameleon peice on you should not be able to hit in vats when they move or chameleon breaks you should be able to vats them crouched. Going to look into this, if this is the case we are going to see every ranged in game crouching very soon.
---
He never insulted me. He was my friend, and now he is dead. He just wanted to march with his friends.
---
Also, while expensive, Vendor Bot Phoenix (The BoS vedor bot) in Watoga regularly has the metal building plans - I think they're around 2400c.
---
Oh ok thanks.
---
I got mine fairly early but that had to be good luck. Havent gotten another and have done the quest alot since.
---
Velociraptor ftw
---
If I ever come across a PS4 and a copy of the game, I’ll be sure to do so! Currently playing on PC at the moment.
---
I have a bloody explosive poon gun. I want to get a quad explosive for pvp. That bloody explosive one does reach absurd damage, though the sustained dps is pretty bad. I supposed quad explosive would fair a lot better for sustain.
---
Yes you are an idiot
---
Event failed
---
That would be useful 
---
Nothing on the muzzle, piercing mag, aligned long barrel,  aligned stock.
---
Sometimes I will be on a server for hours with no issues, not even the issue where the mainframe cores are laggy. Also it doesn't help to have a friend on when the entire server crashes. Im almost irritated enough to find a way to quickly crash servers out of spite. So much work put in for nothing when Bethesda could easily make things a little more fair.
---
Bye Felicia...
---
Im still trying to find an ultracite gatling laser. I see the mods but i have never seen this gun.
---
I kitted out a laser rifle yesterday,base damage was about 100.My toon has all the rifle perks and vats stuff,concentrated fire etc.Attacking super mutants in vats only took about 25% or less of their health per shot.But if I aimed through the scope I was consistently 1 or 2 shotting them.This is the exact opposite of what I would expect,something definitely seems off with vats lately.
---
The run I played last night was the same thing. I verified my audio was set to Area and everything. Its way more fun when people talk to each other.
---
I did the event for some easy xp. Got the owl mask but really I have no use for it. I'll prolly do it again of course but again, just for some easy xp and the level up that comes with it. Better than farming at least and I guess I'll get a trophy for the effort. 
---
Yeah I hear you!  With the current trend in games being live service, it is always disappointing when a game releases with disappointing content.  But I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt -- they really do want to produce the best game they can.  Most game devs work in the industry because they love games, after all.  In the end it boils down to what they can accomplish with the crazy number of limitations they are restricted by, whether it is headcount, funds, or behind the scenes rules they have to abide by.
---
Then people who havent will have no reason to play survival mode. It'll be dead on arrival. Literally every game that's done some sort of mode like this hasn't been dumb enough to try this (PoE, etc. and most notably Runescape). 
---
There are foods that have bonus XP boosts but it depends what you have the recipes for, for canned meat stew do the “feed the people event” at Mama Dolce in Morgan town, there’s a quest at the lighthouse that summons the mothman, if you “commune” (button press) with the mothman you get bonus xp for a limited time. If you find or have the recipes for them cranberry juice is a bonus of 2% xp for limited time, cranberry cobbler 5%, cranberry relish 10% tasty squirrel stew I think is 5%, but basically if your cooking work station will let you cook any of those or you can do those events it will give you more bang for your buck when your completing quests, doing events and killing enemies
---
Can we change the text colour somehow? I miss the old green one from fallout 3..
---
You're a broken record saying "thanks for playing" over and over.
---
Tell me, is there a single video on the internet showing the event rewards screen with one of the rare masks? There's almost no images of it online. You and people who agree with you clutch to like 2 or 3 images proving that it can drop. 
---
Xbox. Thanks though. Will just offer after a parade tonight. I need the set.. have a dozen owls. Lol
---
 Go play with it. They are not especially intuitive. ;)
---
Another under nuked spot (I feel) is around the pumpkin house. There’s a small farm with many crops to the west, a fissure, and hopewell cave nearby. 
---
Thanks for playing 
---
It’d be like metal gear solid,
---
Life slowly depletes when you have the cigar equipped.
---
I think the auto-handmade may be better from range but close in the better recoil if the assault rifle probably adds some accuracy. In close it has a good punch.
---
Man this is sooo lovely. And this is understatement of the year! Imdon’t know what to say except thank you sooo much!
---
So if I were to just do trade, I'd not lose anything right?
---
It takes so much longer... But if that's what it takes hah
---
Survival mode might just become that. If given enough time. 
---
I'll be in in a couple hours. Just caps 
---
I hated the thing anyway
---
Yeah since the update this do everything while drunk or make alcohol is out of hand. I get the theme of it but theyre not worth the effort for 10 atoms.
---
To be honest I usually don't try to revive people anymore unless we are in a cave or large building. The can usually just spawn back without much of an issue. Though the main reason is that 95% of the time i get no option when I try to revive them. 
---
Sweet!! I’m currently at work, but I’ll PM you later on today if that’s cool.
---
You know there are other challenges to do right? I had a challenge where all I had to do was kill 76 scorched with a sword and got 80 atoms. That’s more than leveling up 3 times for only 10. 
---
Sweet! I’m currently at work right now, but I’ll PM you later if that’s cool?
---
I think a faction based deathmatch would be better. Maybe with week long raids with limited lives if you wanted a permadeath aspect. 
---
Well I don’t know about you, but I do greatly enjoy pvp encounters in this game so on the rare chance it’s available I will take them when I can get them. 
---
Oh my golly, this is brilliant!!!
---
So vats seems to do less damage than aiming, that plus a x4 bullet weapon doing same damage than normal version, both on vats. It´s a pitty, I feel vats kinda fun.
---
voted no, only gonna log into survival on my heavy gunner for that special M2 and fatman then go back to adventure (or go for a weekly pipe gun if they ever have one), pvp isnt my thing in this style of game
---
On the plus side, shotguns with Enforcer are ridiculously strong against melee enemies. Pop them in the legs once and you can do what you like. Want to solo nuked whitesprings with a level 35 character? No problem.
---
PvP just doesn’t work for me.
---
Yea or spam 20 pics in each zone (forest, more, etc) for 40 and 50 atoms.
---
Wait, the responder bot is something special? I assumed he was like the stupid lumberjack bots.
---
Imagine these masks are being distributed to people oblivious to their rarity... Playing like once every few days. Chance is inversely proportional to play time over the last month. 
---

---
THIS!!!! most important post on these forums IMO. All games with good economies have tons of caps/credit sinks. More caps leave the game than flow in each day, it's the only way for ingame currency to hold value. Tons of ways too tax for trading selling and buying items with player vendors. Some must have food or crafting components that are player bound and you can only buy from verndors. End game instances that you can only enter by paying a large sum of caps to the game. Any content you need caps to do really, the list goes on. This game only has only one cap sink and its fast travel and even then it's an option.
---
Pretty sure that's a weapon skin

So you’re saying you can’t have your armor equipped while wearing the hooded rags? 
---
The other 5 were people with no link at all, or troll statements.
---
Isn't Hunter vs. Hunted the battle royale mode already?
---
Just look into terminals? Derp around helvetia?
---
no, get out 
---
Its starts on a set timer,you can’t start it yourself
---
 Well, I'm just there for the fun, not the goodies so I agree with the OP.  Being that I'm just over level 100 and have spent a total of maybe an hour playing with others, its different, colorful and like I said, fun. 
---
Sleep every two hours if you can remember for the well rested xp bonus. 
---
A team when you are running, or someone is sharing the Inspirational perk is also good.
---
Events like Uranium Fever (bonus 3 legendaries), Census Violence, BOS Line in the Sand, and the Enclave event Bots on Parade, and frankly, any Enclave event in Harper's Ferry spawn lots of enemies in a short amount of time and grant xp for completing the event. Plus you get the event reward.
---
Uranium Fever will costs steel to repair the extractors while you're doing it, but you will net a ton of steel looting the area and all of the dead mole miners. Sell 200 caps worth of stuff at Whitesprings Station and 200 caps worth at Enclave Bunker if you can and break the rest down for scrap. You should still come out ahead.
---
ive done the event (without crashing near the end three times) and ive gotten the owl mask twice
---
Residual nerve damage from a stroke two years ago is a virtual guarantee that anything requiring split-second precise movement of my left hand is going to be pure frustration. Took me \~5 minutes and three offers by the guy last week to accept a team request from a dude I was fighting next to in a nuke zone. No way I'm gonna make it in survival.
---
I put maybe. I don't like PvP, but after the initial slaughter, and communities start forming, it might not be so bad. Then the extra XP and weapons would be nice.
---
Did you manage it alone? I've been wondering how it'd work by yourself. 
---
Theories suggest that's what Nuclear Winter is.  
---
Sounds like your build may be the issue. Early on I chose the scrounged perk and never had an issue with any ammo. 
---
Like others are saying completing events, killing enemies, and crafting a lot.
---
Good call.
---
I mean, you could always start a new character and level up 3 times in like 10 minutes if you really want the atoms.  
---
Personally I'm sick and tired of so many of the challenges being drinking-related. I get they're happy with the new content and want to promote it but I'm a recovering alcoholic and don't normally drink in game either. Don't mind doing the Biv quests but all the other drinking challenges are a bit much. One per day and week would be more than enough.
---
I rather stay on adventure mode and help newbies in need. I'm not a pvp player. 
---
Yes! And some shower curtains to add around said shower/tub! 
---
I often see short pew plans at the Flatwoods and Sutton vendors.
---
Cranberry Relish for +10% Exp!
---
Yeah, they pulled the "level three times while intoxicated" one last Friday as well. Maybe on a Saturday with nothing else to do, but there's no way I'm gonna down 50 alcoholic beverages or level three times in the 1-2 hrs I'll have free between finishing dinner and turning into a pumpkin.
---
Darn. There has to be some way to use this to make a dunk tank style game, where you taunt players to knock you down. 
---
Yeah at least the owls are cool
---
if I remember rightly, I have seen short pews in either charleston train station or the flatwoods vendor and have seen the cafe table in grafton or sutton train stations.
---
Let the downvotes begin!
---
TS one to the face last night. Much enjoyable 
---
Make a new character,run to flatwood and do the first 2 quests. That are 2 levels already.
---
I do this everytime i can't level up with my main.
---
Old Man Winter, Goblin, Jester, Skull, and Sun. I'm not sure of the actual names because they are that rare lol.
---
I’ve checked Flatwoods and haven’t seen any maybe I’ll try Charleston and Grafton
---
I liked it. Watched the whole thing lol. 
---
Nope. Ive played enough PvP games. That im just over them. Trying to kill the same person over and over just isnt fun at all anymore. 
---
Defensive landscaping. I like it.
---
Is it Nuka-Cola Quantum-colored yet? Is there a Nuka-Cola themed T-51 next to it in your inventory yet? Pitter patter, let's get at 'er.
---
I agree, if it had some sort of special boost then I'd understand but it is purely cosmetic and should be worn over armor
---
I just want a bonfire and a sausage recipe lol 
---
I'm crossing my fingers for an insect swarm to invade.  
---
Responders parametic jumpsuit isn't an event exclusive outfit, you find it from a quest.. LOL
---
After you complete it, it can be triggered again after one hour but someone has to go to Helvetia to trigger it. It won't trigger on its own
---
Longshot, but try Lewisburg Station
---
Fast travel to Helvetia, then server hop there til it starts. Alternately, wait a bit on the server you're on. It goes every hour and there is a server-wide notice when the event starts.
---

---
You must hate your ears
---
I'm on PS4 and I use the one that came with it. I even bought some spares from amazon for $6 each because I misplaced it and they work well
---
Congrats! Got mine a couple of weeks ago. Even though I don't play in power armor except for SBQ fights, it still felt good.  
---
You have to create your own endgame. Mine is collecting every outfit in the game. Down to nine more out of 243.
---
Your first two sentences contradict eachother.  Was the PvP before, during or after the event?
---
I like killing everyone after the event. SLAP SLAP SLAP everyone gets a SLAP!
---
Some people like to party! 🎉
---
i got 3 doughnuts, but no hanging snowflake or mounted ribbons. 
---
On a side note, are you on PS4 by chance? I would like to buy some of your duplicate plans.
---
What system you on ?
---
I suggested a mod that launches bees instead of the normal fire and frost spray respectively. With the mod changing the damage type as well to make sense for it launching a biological agent. That is not a skin.
---
I was able to talk to people this time on Xbox. It's amazing, so many people, populated. I bring my low-tier weapons (except for the bombers, I want to one shot those things before hell) so everyone hits proper
---
I haven't kept records but I'm guessing in the 40-45 range of events completed and still don't have sausage recipe. 
---
Forgot to put that I’m on Xbox
---
I have the the short pew plans
---
My group has this problem intermittently, and usually whomever we can't invite ends up closing the app and relogging until we can invite them. It is such a pain. At first, it seemed like it was some kind of problem between the game and party chat, but that's not it, as it happens other times. I really, really hope this is on their radar to fix because it sucks so hard. Worst bug by far!
---
pc sorry
---
Aren't the mutation recipes around 20,000 each?
---
No shit man not being able to see that stuff is insane. I keep dropping ammo at the flatwoods church to help new players. Like I'll bet iv dropped over a thousand rounds of .38, .44, and plasma stuff as I dont use non ballistic ammo. 
---
&gt;Got a bloodied level 50 Gatling laser off him last night three star must have got lucky 
---
I got a gamma gun with assassin, +50% limb damage, and something else I can't remember. Not great for normal use, but it could be a fucking awesome PvP weapon. 
---
WTF?? entitlement is the right to have something. Use a dictionary before you quote the meaning of something. 
---
The only thing I will buy is the fact from your argument is we don't know what the true drop rate is. However, if you know anything about statistics and data it's pretty good empirical evidence unless you are saying people are literally putting in false data to troll. 
---
Who threw a tantrum? I asked what's the point in my original question. I am not the OP. 
---
You on Xbox?
---
Thanks anyways!
---
I’m so dumb...lately I’ve been popping into whitesprings and it’s only now dawned on me that it’s a nuking site..how I’ve not be irradiated from that is beyond me..I’ll be bring my hazmat suit from now on lol hmm but what’s better ..excavator pa or hazmat? 
---
No, il be giving P.V.P a miss, it’s just not my cup of tea
---
If you're on PS4, let's trade. I've got a spare donut recipe, and you've got some duplicate plans I'm still missing.
---
Make some booze, sure. But make or drink 50? And more than that, the “kill a rabbit while drunk on a booze you can’t make or buy” is totally out of control. 
---
Yep, Gt Staticchmbr1 I can't fast travel, but at the tattoo parlor
---
I've seen him three times in the last two days. Twice at the parade when he was looking for someone else. Once up by Crevasse Dam he was going to insult me but then told me my life was pathetic enough without him adding to my misery.
---
What have I done
---
Only during high population times. I think it is everyone fast travelling in at the end to get the rewards without doing the whole event.
---
It kinda freaked me out because I never seen it nor heard of it before and it just kept following me telling me to hold up lol. I was only thinking of stabbing it and then before I could stop myself it was over and I was 3 peices of steel richer. 
---
Rushing around with Speed Demon and my bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet, slaying almost any enemie with one hit, makes me feel almost like i’m an Deathclaw by myself. Just amazing!
---
This is awesome.
---
Anyone have any news on this? I've sent a ticket to bethesda the day it happened but they have not responded...
---
I really don't want to mae this known,but i noticed today the if a player attacks and kills your pet, they no longer get wanted.
---
A moron lvl 133 today strolled in my camp.
---
My petclaw strangely didn't bother him at all. i waved with no response,then he attcked and killed clawy in no time( not hard).
---
I obviously went full jhon wick in a second,but my pet now is gone.
---
I gotta say, making my Nuka Cola T-51b was a great time.  Finding the plans for the paint was fun on it's own, but then I realized that to actually want to wear it I was going to want to have a jetpack and calibrated shocks at the absolute least.  Sensing helmet, some... kind of arms that I forget, and I was looking at spending 15k caps for just the plans.  That took a while to work towards with all sorts of fun along the way, and then I found out how much flux those modded T-51b parts actually need at max level and I was off on another series of adventures to nuke the area up by the water park.
---
It wasn't easy, but it was damn sure worth it.  I look badass and I built it from scratch!
---
This game has never maxed out my cpu and yes, I do use monitoring programs. Idk if your saying that this could cause a game crash or a server crash but the crashes Im having are the server.
---
Except you get that once. I do all challenges but the dailies add up really fast, and they are meant to be the kind of thing every player can do with an hour or two of time. You know, daily...
---
Rare facial covering...
---
*whispers* Massssskkkkk
---
All been duped to pieces so you can buy them for 1,000-1,200 caps each here on Reddit. 
---
randomly, yes
---
I'd recommend going to r/fo76market
---
Any chance you’ll be on in like 3 hours? I need to hire a mule escort to discover vendors. 
---
Entitlement has multiple meanings. Like this one which is how I am using it:
---
the belief that one is inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment.
---
Perhaps you should be more educated about how words have multiple meanings. It stops people from embarrassing themselves.
---
I think you could look in the mirror and see who is having a tantrum right now. But I also expect you to deny that you are having one. 
---
This feedback has been repeatedly posted since the first announcement of a new mode for pvp focus--
---
Transfer should not be available for back and forth, and any transfer implemented should be a port that rerolls the character to start at 40 or 50 but with full clean perk card choice slate and no equipment, a new vault exit, just with more levels.
---
Dude I hate griefers also I'm so sorry for your loss.
---
That’s when I grab the Pastor’s Vestments and scrap those for the challenge.
---
They started out worshipping the mothman, he was their gateway cult. The Interloper is the thing in the cave.
---
I don't think im even going to participate, but part of me also wants to fist fight people in my underwear. 
---
Well I just found short pews even tho I already checked the Grafton vendor but thanks anyways
---
I've been stockpiling all my duplicate plans since day one in preparation for player vending. Someone will get some very nice cheap plans once it's in the game! Lol
---
Perfect! Cant wait to have you on board. I’ll DM you the link. 🤝
---
I'll have to start put stuff in front of 76
---
It's not that it's a rare item, I wouldnt mind if I didnt get one, even though I've ran it at least 40 times, it's more that for 2 days "no one" got any of the 5 rares, so between everyone on this sub pretty much no one even saw a rare mask. So that's half of the masks just non existent.
---
I was expecting at least 2 of the masks to be super rare, but half of them so rare that no one can tell if they're even in the game is a little too rare for me
---
I run a strength melee build. Bird bones has little impact on this, with class freak in place. And the reduced fall damage coupled with goat legs, means a non PA build is immune-ish to fall damage without needing to waste armor slots.
---
It can be both, actually. And I have to agree, it does feel a bit like a sandbox. Compared to other multiplayer games, the stakes for the player are rather low. Death doesn't really have any penality attached to it. There's new stuff. It's their first game where they go a completely unexplored direction. And I love it. I hope they take what they learned from it and apply it to new Elder Scrolls and Fallout games. That alone makes this game absolutely legit to me, no matter the content and effort involved. I would kill for being able to play together with my brother exploring Fallout 5 or Elder Scrolls 6. 
---
No prob
---
Sort of but no one does it because you get nothing out of it and you have to spend caps to fast travel around to find the other players. And there is only 3 enemies
---
i’ve messaged you 
---
lol troll me more troll. Get a life.
---
Just did it. Incredibly boring to be honest.
---
Sounds like you need to git good! (slightly /s but then again...) I usually dump radaway and stims for fresh out of the vault players when I pass them in game. it would feel wrong to pass by a downed noob at fastnacht! Where's the holiday spirit? 
---
Uh, they really can't make them that much uglier :P.
---
I'll be adding you this evening hopefully, to snag that sweet sweet marsupial serum - time to jump all over and accidentally kill myself a billion times! :D my ign is ladywillow!

on PC, just select and hold E till it tells you to quit that.

Well now I feel bad. :c

Preaching to the choir here.

It was cute the first time. After that, it's really dull.

This is such a great idea.
---
Hmm, I think I read a piece that said 3% per shot up to 30%. It was sciencey, but it made me sad. I like the other guy's answer. 
---
Been playing Anthem. Came back to 76 to realize the game looks like it was made in 2005.
---
Excellent!  I’m not on now but just shoot me a message when you’re ready.
---
I asked for insects not the Apocalypse again
---
Nah just use it for cloth -- unless you want to hoard it for when we can decorate our homes
---
Nothing. It's literally useless in this game. The safe full of money gag is getting kinda tired lol
---
Yeah, this is right. It's not the same spawn where the Vendor spawns. It's east of there, past the lake. There is a flat, bare dirt area behind the houses. Has a chance to spawn corpses, containers, crashed satellites and vertibirds, etc. in the same spot.
---
I’ll take it. I use cloth all the time. 
---
To be fair, seeing a tic for the first time while in the wasteland was a little traumatic. Spiders are nope.
---
What about snakes? That could work.
---
Awesome, thank you for that! Good to know it's one code. :)
---
From what i hear there are different barrels you can unlock by scrapping. I have not myself yet and am unsure if Karma is one of them. I would imagine it is though
---
Lol! I’m sorry you lacked knowledge about the meaning of the word entitlement.
---
I’m sorry I ruined your life.
---
He spawns in at least three different places so this isn't always accurate. I find he spawns where ever I'm not looking at first so I'm always trying to look around.
---
Instigating shotgun coupled with Concentrated Fire for headshots. Not as powerful as some builds but far less complicated.
---
You don’t build anything new. You only move pre war stuff to your camp. And because only robots know how to clean everything stays dirty. That is what happens when you rely on technology too much.
---
You could easily make a case that he was a lying douchebag who found and reworked some prewar jet he got his hands on or read in a chemistry text in area that hadn’t had a steady supply in 100 years. The whole area is a blasted wasteland filled with people looking for an escape. Prewar jet probably got used up in the first decade. Of course he’s going to tell you it was all him- he’s a totally selfish asshole. Plus his jet addiction was almost incurable and very debilitating while east coast (prewar) jet really isn’t (cleaner product, probably).
---
Anyway, the idea that Jet is made from cow shit is ridiculous and should be retconned anyway. 
---
Yup, it automatically unequip all armor :/
---
whitespring vendor which sells plans
---
Scrap it for Cloth.
---
Learn a Civil War Hat plan.
---
Make a hat for 1 cloth.
---
Sell it for 15 caps.
---
Voila, prewar money is worth 15 caps/each!
---
i'm on pc, sorry, i was lucky enough to find the donut recipe in a random paper bag tho. 
---
The funny thing is, that mask isn't a drop. It is from the event Monster Mash and can sometimes bug out and let you keep it. 
---
we can still play in teams for survival?
---
I know but it's where it's originally placed and it's always in the centre of the build area, meaning it's useless if you build anything large. 
---
If they stop transfers.. Op builds will stay in adventure. They made survival mode for those people. Let them go in peace.
---
Op do you even plan on playing survival?
---
I got 1 disconnect about 5 seconds before the rewards. Lol
---
That's interesting... I think to do this you'd need to use a living object, like a living brahmin or another player. Not sure how much "push" you'd actually get from the impact though.
---
\^ This. Though I will say: 15 caps? Do you have -1 charisma? I'm getting 38 caps for each one and aren't even close to being a charisma character.
---
I just missed the recent sale which is why I was thinking of picking up a used version at this point. Whilst looking around for reputable sellers, I did find out Amazon Warehouse also sells used copies.
---
I read their description and it just said "Item may come repackaged" with no mention of missing content. I think I'll be good. I'll also be able to refund it if turns out false.
---
Also can we get a steel plate and concrete version while we are at it
---
😱
---
use molotovs. cheap, large spread so you tag every ghoul in a group, and with pacifist mode on has zero impact on other players. No scattered bodies to try and find for looting like grenades do.
---
I powerlevelled a buddy this way. Grouped, he followed at a distance. I rounded up a group, he'd molotov, and I'd mow them down. He went from 5 or so to 50 in two game sessions. And this was after the exp nerf at the golf course.
---
I got the giants mask... 3 times. 3 times. But this event is so much fun. From the interaction I had last night. So worth it. Got two New ps4 buddies who did the event two more times with me. When we were open Mic we tried to get everyone to ease up on the sloth but there is always that one guy who can't settle down. Truly a fun experience overall. 
---
i feel like the bug is due to the fact that it covers all slots of gear except for your face (body and head etc),  and in fo4 it couldn't be equipped with anything else, and they likely forgot to update it to be purely cosmetic, cuz it's "different" from the other outfits that just cover the body slot. but yeah, it's been a known bug since day one, just unfortunately not fixed yet. it's one of my faves too, so i'd love to wear it!
---
Thanks, that's what I'm hoping for. :)

This is the route I take. My camp is basically at the bottom of this line. It usually has mutants on the way to  and in Huntersville, sometimes supers fighting a Dethclaw/sentrybot/ yao guai and of course Wet Tek is full of them. I get a ton of guns to breakdown too. Works well for me and my squad. 
---
Just got the skiing red and green outfit from the Charleston vendor bot as well last night -- wasn't sure if it was rare, but hadn't seen it before, and it was cheap, so I grabbed it. Looks cool with the green Fasnacht mask too. 
---
Also, tip on the vendor bot spawn: I've had success (like 10% rate) fast-traveling to Charleston station, and heading north on the tracks across the train trestle; he'll then spawn on the far side. (Tho the other nine times I get attacked by a horde of dogs or scorched, but hey, it's the wasteland, s\*\*t happens.)

I'm a raider
---
Wait I missed something, can you fill me in?
---
Well I mean 10 atoms isn’t all that much if you can’t level up 3 times. You could create a new character for it if the 10 atoms mean that much to you. 
---
&gt;usually 
---
That's comforting.
---
Hopefully the Tricentennial is different, but it's interesting it came separately.
---
20 atoms for jangle icon
---
Does tobacco smoke cause lung cancer or the shitty fiberglass filters they used to use cause it in the boomers that gave us this preconception? I’ve known more people to die from pancreatic cancer than lung cancer. And I blame diet soda. Diet soda is x100 worse than cigarettes. Don’t believe me? Look at your average diet soda drinker compared to the average smoker.
---
Also clean loofahs and scented candles! 
---
There should be a FOV detriment for wearing the power armor. There is now. The HUD is awful and you can't see. 
---
server crashed, or you crashed? I have not seen a server crash in ages.
---
I have been hording all my ammo since I'm doing a melee build, plus I have been crafting loads of 5.56 for the XP and to use resources. I had over 15k 5.56 at one point. 
---
Over half my stash weight was ammo until my friends started playing and I gave most of it away to them.
---
So the cap sink exists. Just don't buy stuff from cheaters.
---
It's never been 200 as far as I can remember
---
PC for me. I did not see mention of 500 atoms included, so perhaps I'll be good.
---
I thought rdr2 online was a total mess
---
I can’t, sorry about that dude. Name a time tomorrow and I’m all yours tho
---
I’ve only saw myself wear it on PS4. No one really wears it so I like to think it’s rare even if it isn’t. The only time I’ve ever saw it was on the fallout wiki page 
---
What's the power armour paint?
---
It looks awesome.
---
I'm saving up duplicate plans and masks for player vending but if I get a rare one (at least the one rare one I really want), no way am I selling it. If only 5 people get one, what are the chances any of them will sell it? 
---
Hate isn't a problem. Whiteknighting and forced positivity is
---
I like the invisible head feature.
---
My spot moves when I move mine. I got tired of spawning off the cliff so moved that thing and kept testing. Now I spawn at my door step every time
---
The point here is: Don’t have kids folks, they ruin the gaming experience of living in a post apocalyptic world... 
---
On a serious note, why are you playing Fallout in front of your kids? I get you might be a stay at home parent but, you’re playing a game that has profanity, violence , sexual themes and nightmarish creatures. If you actually want to shelter your kids like most parents in this PC nation, then play Minecraft. Not sorry.
---
No link?
---
nuke zones, wes-tek runs are where my levels flowed fast. Large groups of mobs in the 50's to 90's are what you want.
---
I keep scrapping syringers and have yet to get a karma barrel. Best bet is to find someone doing that quest and have them craft one for you. 
---
Two cannibals are eating a clown. One says to the other "Does this taste funny to you?"
---
You sound conflicted lol 😂
---
Upgraded to two stars though. If you only have one star it only reduces the chances. "Class Freak" can be a good card too. At max it reduces the negative effects of mutations by 75%.
---
Maybe..... Iguana Bob's finest
---
Yeah ive wanted this since F4. Hate that HUD and depending on what gun you use almost half the screens obstructed.
---
At least you have good taste in shows!
---
I like to hunt you
---
It isn't feedback though, they haven't even played the mode yet. It's just them saying what they want for a mode that hasn't even been released. I'd understand if people complained about things AFTER playing it but they're basically complaining about something before playing it. It's rather silly honestly.
---
on the weapons? the survival mode will have a weekly challenge reward of a legendary weapon for each week apparently.  iirc the first 6 weeks are in the last "inside the vault"
---
Enjoy the harvest!
---
True, but should still be an option. 
---
I bulk to sell excess. To save time, I just do "show craftable" and then bulk everything. Then I take all the excess and sell it to vendors.
---
If you are a shotgunner, this may not be as viable a plan. I always have plenty of plastic by my shotgun friend does not.
---
I missed that, thanks for the heads up.
---
That doesn't change where others spawn at your base though and that's the main issue, whenever anyone fast travels to my base they end up in the floor. 
---
Martial Artist is left over from when I had a melee/Rifle build. I don’t use blocker bc I haven’t felt like I needed extra damage reduction. Concentrated Fire I still have a few more levels to go to switch points around. 
---
Once I had all the damage buffs I didn’t want to wait any longer to play with my heavy weapons as I spent about 20 levels getting all the cards for what I wanted to do. 
---
Cough..OCD....cough
---
I hear your double date and raise you to a double dog dare you. 
---
I mainly dislike it cos it occludes some of my gun lol. I like seeing my big guns.

Might be able to grind with you Sunday
---
I’ll help when I’m on maxpowers_69
---
Your amazing
---
Define a lot
---
Cans and fall out miracle preservative
---
Last time I told Todd to bring home tampons he got pads 
---
No, people who had to throw away every thing wouldn't play. This way people from before will play and some new as well
---
I’ll take whatever you have, whether it be 5, 10, 100, 1000 lol! I need a lot dude 
---
Do they even drop ? Or is it just a hype thing lately people don’t even want to this anymore
---
I mean.  I still kinda want to see some cool skins for Excavator.  2 options is better than 1, but how about some cool helmets or something.  
---
Gee thanks guys.
---
Can we get an increase in flamer fuel production? That’s a neat useless perk at 5/9 per 10 acid. You have to farm oil and acid all day just for one full flamer tank. The cryolator crafts 25. Why the difference? 
---
This is what killed H1Z1 on PC. 
---
I'll add you.
---
Ill message you
---
Even worse if you have a Grognak axe
---
Use them in order.. first hoard all type of ammo until it gets 1500, then use it with proper gun... and store others to stash.. 308 is for hunting rifle, 38 for modded receiver for other rifle,.. etc
---
Yeah it's over 6500$ for sure. No joke.
---
Hey dog, I heard you like Excavator armor....
---
Which cave? Have you seen it?
---
I’m from ps4 and the other day I was talking to someone who plays on pc, he said that any high high end items don’t go for caps, he said u get a 3rd party involved, u decide b4 what u trade for and the 3rd guy takes both items and drops for each person.
---
He said there’s like a whole barter group on here somewhere for that. 
---
It involves a lot of trust. 
---
Actually crash wise I would say patch 6 was better, the most recent patch has brought back 2/3 of the crash scenarios that were present before patch 6. Load in times have doubled too, which is extremely frustrating.
---
Super Fruit &gt; Super Soldier
---
Instead of going to parades, you should confront your hoarding issues.
---
This looks like the hottest album of 2102. 
---
Also giant insects! Everyone knows when you irradiate an insect it becomes giant! 
---
I think Bethesda is running a sort of load test with the event.  I've run the event about 15 times now.  What I've noticed is when more then 15-ish people show up the sloth battle seems to overwhelm the server.   As the number of players goes up we get a bag lag spike when we all open fire on the Sloth.   At that point its a 50/50 shot if we disconnect or not.  
---
The amount of things the server has to keep track of in a single "map block" (not sure what term to use) and get updates out to all the clients for this event isn't like anything else, except maybe the queen fight.  During the entire parade we're all spread out and targeting different mobs, the items to track aren't as rapid fire.  At the end its everybody in a small area focused on a single Sloth.   I don't think I've seen a sloth battle that lasted longer then 10 seconds.
---
Yeah🤔
---
That's fair. I think they need to bump up their paint output in general. There's lots of things they could do
---
If you repaired only the pen you could set down two series of the Fasnacht balloons and pop them to indicate scoring.   
---
I don’t mind grinding for sweet gear, I just don’t know how to do it in 76. I wish there were clearer instances, maybe some dungeons to run or raids. I’ve played every Fallout, but I’ve only really experienced MMOs through FFXIV. I might just be missing something, but after 120 hours or so and launching my first nuke I just didn’t see what was worth sticking around for. 
---
Though if you have tips or some insider suggestions I would gladly hear them, my fiancé and I both want to return to playing, we just feel like there’s nothing for us to do (other than repeat dailies and events.)
---
With that logic why can I sell stimpacks and water. Its far too easy to get far too much.
---
Having a cap on the vendors inventories and just in general how the vendors are handled / exchange rates is a shit stain on this game. 
---
you're right im buggin. it was 400 then 600 then 800. i had 200 in my head cause of how much it increased. 
---
I saw the sloth on my first run, and completely butchered it my gut sank when I gave it to cents of thought of the the scenario afterwards. It drops trash anyways. I've been covering the rear flank , blowing holes in wolves and big ol' skeeters since then.  But I loved how it dropped out of the tree, I hadn't seen that animation before, and it was fantastically unexpected.  
---
Where do you get that plan?
---
It's really about time someone wrote something like this. After all the duping of old world f76 cosmetic items, I agree that the drop rate is perfectly fine as is
---
Meh, I just bought a TSE Gatling gun for caps about 30 minutes ago on PC.
---
Walls for me, I hate the dirty walls and would pay real money for atoms to get it if needed. Perhaps that's Bethesdas idea, they've done it with generators (The one thing I don't care about being clean) 
---
Any news on anything yet? I submitted a ticket but have yet to receive anything back. Not even an automated response. Its weird because my husband and I were both banned with the first ban wave in February and we both got our accounts back on the 16th or 17th and then 2 days later I'm banned again but he isn't and we both hadn't played the fasnacht event nor had we exploited the game in any way. So apparently they didn't re ban everyone...
---
Yes but if you’re following someone making an attempt to avoid you then you’re an asshole. Just because there *is* pvp doesn’t mean you have to kill everybody you come across. Don’t make this game gta online. 
---
Where is this easy mode talk coming from? Only talks of loot I’ve seen is people asking for the loot they’ve worked for. I’ve done 6 SBQ fights and each queen has dropped me absolutely nothing. An empty carcass. 
---
If you feel the game is too easy. Survival mode is around the corner and waiting for you on release. 
---
I see humans running around pretty frequently...
---
Not true at all, looksmenu adds all these things and more
---
I want an unsanitary bathroom that is completely disgusting because I'm a filthy raider 
---
ok 
---
It’s still a nice idea I think, being able to trade item for item.
---
Like in fallout 4 u could add a bunch of stuff from your inventory and the vendors so it was one big transaction
---
Everyone knows sheepsquaches aren't real. 
---
nope, the only thing you see from me before you die are red eyes
---
Only if your role playing a banker or mobster. Mostly needed for armour and few weapons. 
---
Dude, do your research! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview#gid=63173560
---
Its on the droplist! Its not event exclusive but its a possible "rare" reward from events. In the end I got the Paramedic Jumpsuit two times from doing events, I had a lot of bad luck.
---
So you can get rewards from events that arent exclusive to events. You migjt get some shit that you can find in the horld or is a quest reward already. The event reward system is horse shit.
---
owl is not rare
---
And Todd by himself said F76 is experiment. So it's old news
---
Nah,y well managed hoarding is awesome and has significant advantages for both me and people I run into.
---
That's where I looked and across from it IT DOESN'T SAY EVENT ONLY. I got one from a quest myself.. LOL
---
Should be Responders, BOS, and Enclave. Free States were mostly fried with the Responders.
---
it's the mothmen paint, is/was in atom store
---
I am guilty of doing that accidentally once... but pull out a less powerful gun now. I felt bad after hitting it with a two shot exploding dragon, and seeing it drop while people were still trying to get to it 😕
---
Pretty sure I have all the mods for the syringer. I think I may make an alt and trade one karma over and see. Thanks for the replies!
---
Is a mask meant to drop every time you compete the event?
---
And the small water purifier.  I'm happy to have that one.
---
You stay invisible through the life of the timer regardless of what your doing. No crouching necessary.
---
West Tek, then Whitesprings, server hop, repeat. I’m Level 103 and used this to climb from 55 in barely  2 weeks and I only play about 2 hours a day. Plus the mutants drop lots of caps so you make some dough while you’re at it. 
---
Never noticed it was broken. Works perfectly fine for me and I never had any problems.
---
Getcha, had me questioning it myself since I played from beta haha
---
Pro tip: no one gives a flying fuck about why you (or anyone else) is "quitting the game." 
---
I am starting to feel like all these ppl making “this” post really haven’t even truly played the game or let alone watched the promo for the fasnacht event.
---
No prob. Any interest in the occasional paid gig that I hate asking friends for? Simple stuff like quick transfers or holding a server. 
---
Grinding is exactly what it is. There’s no real big tips other than as you guys play and level up, you’ll find better places to farm junk, legendaries and unlock other features. If ammo is an issue, which seems to be one of the many complaints that I’ve seen. Go into your Pip-Boy, scroll to junk and hit the button that shows you what materials that you have gathered so far. From there, just tag what you’re looking for and it will make it much easier to not accidentally skip something that has it. Such as plastic. Golf clubs and pool sticks have plastic. I didn’t know that when I started. Golf balls are another. Whitesprings is literally a plastic fest for gathering.
---
From there it’s just picking perks and gear. I’d suggest staying away from googled examples of builds. Most of them are highly flawed and those who use them, don’t really understand the build, so they end up subpar because it doesn’t actually suit their play style. 
---
Cranium concealer
---
It's just for my power armor :)))
---
The railway rifle was in 3 and NV too
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Railway_rifle
---
Pc, Xbox or Ps4 ???
---
Totally
---
Yeah sure, name a time
---
You can make gunpowder with it. Or with the cloth after you scrapped it, to be more precise.
---
Well, they already should be crouching in order to juke melee users.
---
 It's kinda lame my low damage, low clip size pistol, which relies on vats headshots to do any meaningful damage is completely broken by this new update.
---
Xbox
---
Who needs the see the right side of their screen‽
---
I'm not rushing, I just want to use my power armor :)
---
Am lawn care. Our biggest seller is baked human poo. Great for the garden, safe for the kids!
---
And I hope it stays that way (not getting shit after 6 sbq fights). Ain't rare if you can get it at less than 1 in 10 odds
---
Congratulations! I havent even fought a scorch beast yet, so I cant even imagine taking on the SBQ, I'm lv 24 ya know, but I'm looking forward to it.
---
Leahm_Grove. I'll be on tomorrow evening. Got a hazmat suit you can have, maybe we can find a nuke zone. Tag some shit and I'll drop them.
---
Yes its not event only, but you can still get it from events.
---
I'm not looking for a responders jumpsuit sorry but I already threw mine away because it's dogshit. 
---
You can guaranteed find plans at Welch Station once you get to a high enough level
---
Yes, will give birth to a newb and take advantage of the 20% XP bonus.
---
Alot of people were talking about it being broken after the latest patch and I didn't notice it until recently 
---
Get in the habit of launching a nuke at the water park in the Toxic valley. Violet flux for days. 
---
Got it, :)
---
I won't be home from work for a couple hours yet, but if tonight doesn't work for you I'll be around this weekend too! :)
---
Try again next year 
---
Pro tip: use a gamma gun with deep dish to do rad damage.
---
You will one shot those bloodied builds so easily.
---
Can sitting on the toilet also start an idle animation of opening a newspaper and after 1 minute you get a buff that slows hunger and needing drink for like 20 minutes. The buff can be called "staying regular". 
---
I dont care if you look for a jumpsuit. I didnt try to sell one. This post is just about info on how to get event exclusives.
---
I nuke hemlock holes for violets all the time dude. It’s having the materials to make it stable what’s the problem. Plus I’m level 220, I’d rather just buy it than put the effort in haha! 
---
She should drop something. Not getting anything is a slap in the face. 
---
How do you put a tag like yours? The name that appear in blue like yours 'Responders'
---
Not a problem. I’ll be around. 
---
Why would you want a grognaks ax when you can’t even over repair it? Great, another new player who buys caps with cash, buys the cheesiest weapon and becomes viable in pvp with no effort. This game has been pay to win for a certain crowd from the first day. 
---
Nice man.  That fight is fun as hell when everything comes together.
---
It's baked. You would attain much of the same process by emptying your portajohn, mixing the contents with mud, and baking the result on a metal sheet over an open fire, turning occasionally. Of course, this is a world where we eat the tumors that sometimes appear as a side effect of instantaneously healing syringes, I imagine you could like, point a laser at it or something. Hit it with a a radray maybe?
---
havent played online so I wouldnt know, but as I recall it was rushed out so I would believe it.
---
You don’t want to know how many times I farm her a day then. The game has bugs. This post isn’t in regards to bugs. Loot missing is usually because how many people are at the location and how many dead bodies are around. It clogs everything up. If it happens to me, I just wait until people leave and the loot pops up.
---
Difficulty in general is what I’m talking about. I still have interest in the queen because I know I have a CHANCE at a good drop. I know it will more than likely be a bad drop but it still keeps some of us interested. I like the idea that I don’t have the best gear in the game but I do also like knowing that the gear that I do have, I’ve earned vs. being a freebie drop. I like hard games. That’s why I say that they could consider multiple difficulty modes. Each mode can have a different drop rate on items. So rather than giving into someone who wants easy mode, or someone like you that just wants a better chance. The game can be tailored to the whole community and not just a section of the community. As for bugs, every game has them. Yea they are annoying and they need fixed but the post isn’t about bugs. 
---
For real?! Daggum, TIL. :O I need to stop being so trigger-happy, lol.
---
Anyone notice how there hasn't been a Bethesda response in days? 
---
Awesome sounds good, got called in for another shift so I won’t be on until later tonight. But I’m almost positive I have both of those, when I get on tonight if you don’t have them I can drop some for you! 
---
Thx for the tip, I'll look for someone willing to do that, thx again :)
---
Thought you meant like *3s. Did you try to manually search it like with X (Xbox) or waiting a bit? Happens to me all the time with any enemy :/
---
Despite Bethesda saying all legendaries will drop a legendary 
---
Ok, I feel dumb. What Sloth? I've done the event a few times, and I have never seen a sloth appear. Does it have some kind of special drop?
---
You can’t put paint jobs on other players PA, it doesn’t let you drop or trade it.
---
I have a bunch 
---
You can paint non-Atom stir paints. 
---
Ok that’s what I thought you meant just checking 
---
Most ofyall just need to visit fasnacht irl to calm down
---
Oh yeah, I'm not making excuses here, they need a new engine, but I'm trying to examine and share why its SO bad, not just bad engine problems but devs that accidentally go back a version with an update, and struggle to get updates and features out, it's almost like asking a person who can code in python to start working with java, it's just not going to end well, and it didnt, I enjoy the game but it needs more to keep me really entertained and I'm going to let it get to that point and revisit it, I have plenty of options to explore while I wait for it to get there.
---
Keep your .308, the mg42 uses it 
---
Ah I see, I assumed Atom shop paint jobs. Carry on then
---
Nice, I've been thinking of nuking up there. Was there enough things to kill for other mats though? I've found some places are great if you already have plenty of mass/fluids but terrible without. 
---
I have all the civil war era plans and the TOP Hat is the one you want and it's a rare drop, but worth it, 1 hat 1 cloth for ~35c. The only places I found for the random drop are Cravasse Dam and New Gad, just server hop.
---
Creation club is present in previous fallout games. But just a point to ad. If we have this creation club active on 76 it would make the bans for exploits pointless. Theres mods in fallout 4 that were specifically for gear and weapons so probably wouldnt be a good idea considering the witch hunts people stsrt over seeing more then one item in somone inventory. This community is a bit too sensitive for such great things lol
---
Thank u I'll add u now
---
For the \*hats\*? They're "worth" 60, and vendors never give you more than 25% the value.
---
I specifically know the Union &amp; confederate hats. Is there another with a crazy value for 1 cloth?
---
To know if it's broken like adrenalin reaction was check your pip-boy then check your stats if you see the positives then it works of not it don't work. Take this with a grant of salt because I have not confirmed this but this was the way to check if adrenal reaction was working.
---
this happened today 
---
nobody got any loot or mask 
---
Mrs. Bishop contradicts Myron's claims anyway. Also, I'm not *super* inclined to trust a drug-dealing rapist when he makes claims about the drug he's trying to offload. 
---
Awesome. I’ll add you in a bit. For the most part it would be if I find a body and see your online I’ll pay you to stand there a couple minutes. 
---
I can always do the same types of things if you ever need someone. My psn is sneazel btw. 
---
What are you talking about I just want to buy weapons calm down, and no I don’t ‘buy caps with cash’. I just haven’t been very lucky with legendary drops. Chill the fuck out and stop getting angry for no reason.
---
Well I’m not saying it’d be something players would have to pay for or that there are any items/mods just creations within the vanilla game. I was thinking it’d be something free because the $60 is already so lack luster they might as well take that into account.
---
I enjoy playing for something. If I got everything I wanted too easily I wouldn’t even know what to do anymore and would probably stop playing. 
---
what is your psn username 
---
Are there any new enemies?
---
Are there any new weapons?
---
Any new armor? Any new quest objectives we haven't seen before?
---
Any new *anything* besides some masks???
---
I see these all the time at vendors. Check each one daily
---
I guess Bethesda doesn’t realize some of us have jobs 
---
I give away unused ammo all the time. I usually run .45, 5.56, and .50, but I recently switched from .308 to .50 for micro-optimizing my weight management. I’ve probably given away over 40k combined since the game started.
---
I drop almost all energy ammo b/c I plan on going with the grounded mutation soon.
---
Dropping 300 .308 on a lv10 sure makes them happy! Nice way to make someone’s day 😎
---
Honestly if it gets to 'dump the motherboard' levels it'll probably be more affordable in the long run for me to just replace the entire system. I'm looking for 'not perfect but it'll do', not necessarily tip top of the line. I found the CPU and RAM I need for $150 total on NewEgg, the Phenom runs about $250 while I have no idea if I can even find a new motherboard that will fit my case, or that will work with the parts i already have. 😕
---
Well at least it’s not a multiplayer game and the bug shouldn’t affect you that m....... wait a minute...
---
I’d also like to level up existing legendaries, I have some that are really good but not level 50. 
---
The concept of leveling up existing weapons does  exist in the game so it shouldn’t be that much of a stretch. 
---
You have a point. It would add play value to the game for sure. But the people who play would have to get over the fact theres going to be exploits and so on. Its bethesda all of their games are like this. And people have made great use of em in the past. In fact creation clud and its use of exploits made fo4 so much fun to play even after a year of grinding
---
I’d even settle for the hud disappearing when I take my helmet off,  especially as it’s something I quite often do.
---
Exploring and grinding
---
A related note - in the last patch they added Stash boxes to the bunker.   
---
I could care little for good loot. My current stuff is a mixed bag of nuts. I enjoy it and will enjoy tomorrow. It’s a survival style game for the moment. Dog eat dog. Strongest survive blah blah blah. If someone didn’t hit that legendary down the way oh well move faster. 
---
But making a multi mode difficultly system is just bad. All that it does is hold people back and create multi power curves that aren’t going to included in the checks and balances. 
---
Also I never said anything about bugs. If queenie has drop issues that’s a sever stability issue. 
---
There is the word "astropanda" as well as a panda and jangles the moon monkey up there. Thats where my camp front door is. If you got that far without a jetpack AND marsupial I commend you for your efforts.
---
What? Where’s the sexual themes? The profanity is non existent, and the violence is cartoon like. I take it you don’t have kids so you don’t understand? I’d hardly say a super mutant or a scorched is anything worse than what’s in kids cartoons! Anyway it’s not like they sit there watching. They’ve got better things to do. And no, I’m not a stay at home dad I’m not sure how you came to that conclusion lol. 
---
I agree even though I do wish CC was significantly cheaper.
---
I completely agree. I miss when games were about the challenge and less of, how can we accommodate those who basically wants the game to play itself. I remember games before blizzard put their hands on the concept. You actually had to read a quest, explore and find what you had to do vs. now you have quest markers, quest circles and to top it off, there’s no actual objective to the quest. No strategy or sequence of triggering events to make the quest interesting. Now, so many games just go from point A to point B. That’s about it. Of course it’s just my opinion. 
---
Get good..jk bruh seriously
---
I agree entirely 
---
Easy: Targeting HUD was (and still is, I suppose, as the effect is still visible to anyone nearby, so it's obviously not fixed) the number one answer to people asking why their game kept crashing. Removing the mod does reliably fix that. Not doing a simple search and continue crashing your own game is your choice, but as the effect bleeds out and crashes others' clients as well, that's what makes them a douchebag. Unwittingly or not.  
---
I have to check. I did not feel a difference till now. Still felt pretty fast. Is the word that it’s not working at all or are you just a bit slower?
---
What do you use all this flux for, saw you looking for a load of yellow cake the other day. You must be chewing through the stuff, especially as you seem to be sir nuke a lot 😜
---
Definitely agree on the auto-handmade.
---
One other thing I noticed with the assault rifle is that the reload (of a perforating magazine) seemed faster than the combat rifle and handmade. Maybe it was just my imagination though.
---
The speed increase seems to still be in place.  The increased thirst/hunger *definitely* seems to be in place.  The reload speed is definitely not there any more.
---
If all the robots make it to the end you’ll get s mask. If one or more die, the chance goes down. 
---
Just saw that myself. It was a level 25 using an empty power armor frame, at the end of the event everyone was shooting at them, turns out they had a full party of level 200+ people with them and they just slaughtered everyone, mocked them and took their junk.
---
Nah I waited near an hour zoned in and out four or five times and checked for body and pile. Nothing. Everything else dropped but not her. Walked away 500 rounds less and a 2* explosive crippling level 20 black powder pistol from a diseased radrat. 
---
Sounds good, dude! Be safe getting to work, and I’ll see you tonight. :) 
---
Extra benefits for Travel Agent sound good!  I do t have much complaints for TA by itself though.  I wish they had a perk card that would slow down thirst and hunger though.
---
Build it where Graham and Chally can cross and make it the ChallyChuck 9000.
---
I am going to start posting this on everyone of these posts.

It’s annoying but it’s a good way to review your perks before going boldly.

I kind of wish more people would chant Burn Him as we gather around the effigy

For the first time last night and today I noticed an on-screen notification when Fasnacht starts -- a box appears in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Huge help -- don't have to keep checking the map constantly for the yellow event icon. But maybe this is on console only? (I'm PS4) I didn't see the notification at all earlier in the week during the first couple days of Fasnacht. Seems unusual for BGS to roll out a change like that w/o a patch, but at least it was a helpful one.
---
same  here 
---
got killed after I shot him up  and he explored like a super nuke  
---
Would be nice. Also All Night Long does that. 
---
Bloodied, all the way..
---
Ahhhh That explains it. I haven't learned the tophat, just the soldier ones. Those are only worth 15
---
Hey idk if you ever found the plan that you needed but I know how you can get it for free. When you team up with someone who hasn't done the Belly of the Beast quest before, beating it with them awards you the plans again for completing the mission, as well as another suit of ultracite armor. Cheers 
---
Haha ammo bro! I have a team behind me that all use violet flux.. We are all lazy and would rather buy the stuff than go and get it ourselves 😂 I’ve done in 200 stable violet alone this week! 
---
You can milk the Brahmin?!? How? 
---
Either will do the trick. I use PA so I can keep the rest of my equipment on and easily accessible instead of digging through my Apparel tab each time.
---
Also helps in the rare case there’s something like a grafton monster playing tag with the robots.
---
Wouldn’t that require a specific build though? It would take me a while to level enough to move all my points around
---
So I'm still pretty new to this game. Do people who run bloodied builds have the stereotype of being toxic? Pretty much every post I've read calls them out for being dickheads.
---
god I hate that dammed thing  
---
Do you have the flux's needed to build a decontamination shower?
---
HarveyOsbourne
---
Killer, what's your PSN?
---
Stand off the back side of where it spawns or on the corner of the roof for a easy shot. 
---
This is actually good information, because now you know if you can’t get playtime the next da, if you time your quests right you can still get your chance at the crafting recipes 
---
PC, the "E" key. XB/PS4, whatever button you use to open doors, I'd assume. New since the Wild Appalachia update.
---
Ah I see. I did not pay attention to this detail to be honest. Have to check. Thanks!
---
Makes me wonder how in the hell they manage to fuck up another mutation with every update.
---
I know it works for a team, if only one person is wearing it. It might work for everyone in the vicinity, but I'm not sure. 
---
What? I have around 7 nuke cards. Getting in there to do the nuke is no biggie. I may do this tonight. 
---
You can drop the HUD out in Settings, right? 
---
Stalkers, go for stalkers! /s
---
It depends a little on play style. Bloodied would be right up at the top for a lot of people.  Anti armor would be a close second. 
---
I do! I might charge you for that though, that shit’s not cheap.
---
I was beginning to wonder if it was multiplayer or not.
---
Oh ok. Yea I guess I never re check, I just sell and get the hell out of dodge to the next one on my run
---
Only turn off the entire hud, HP, crosshair, ap, everything.... 
---
Wouldn’t bloodied take a specific build for bloodied? It would take me a while to move points around and I don’t know how I feel having little to no health lol
---
Like claiming Dolly Sods for the weekly challenge. 
---
Yeah, I totally need a wood farm in the middle of a high level zone to defend constantly.  Nah man, just give me my Atoms and nature or whoever else can keep the place. 
---
I want better underwear.
---
Kazamati 
---
Pacifist mode exists. For. A. Reason.
---
it really bugs me that clean toilets exist in the world but I can't have one and the lack of any kind of sink for our camps is especially confusing. 
---
I was just wondering that same thing. Got the armor for the first time today and was wondering if this was a thing. I'm sure the future patches will keep shelling out new paintjobs.(hopefully cooler ones than they have been putting out)
---
I don't want to throw shade at Sony. But... They do have a history of being 'fun police', so to speak.
---
As for PvP, it could be an issue, true. I don't know how Bethesda could fix that, but I'm sure there's a way.
---
Exactly... you want to strip the power armour overlay but keep quest tips etc?
---
A quick way to check is run around a bit, reload your weapon to get a baseline then take some Rad-X then run around again and reload weapons. 
---
Seconded. #bethesdaplz
---
It's because it was common in 4 for melee builds to be ammo millionaires breaking the economy. 
---
I do think we should be able to break down ammo so we can create other types. 
---
This is a terrible idea! 
---
Just straight up without messing with any perks I think instigating, swing speed, +1 strength. Without a build around it I think this would be your strongest.
---
Charleston has short pews. I camp close buy and I go there to sell stuff everyday.
---
I did this last night though? Guy "sold me" 800 .45 ammo for 0 caps, and I "sold" him some plans for 0 caps.
---
Not possible on console.  
---
  So it seems that if you move your C.A.M.P unit inside a restricted build area after initial placement (regardless if it is placed on ground, foundation or upperfloor), your camp will be blocked after logging in a second time.  Tried this a couple of times and it works for me as long as the C.A.M.P unit is outside the restricted area. My initial placement of C.A.M.P unit is right along the edge of the allowed/restricted building area at Solumon's Pond.
---
I have had the exact same experience. I used to run around the map looking for people who would want to pvp but lately for some reason they have all just been 1 shotting me. It doesn't matter what weapon they use or what level they are at. 
---
If they attack first then the first time I hit them is still slap damage but if I attack first they do full damage the first time they hit.
---
Shit. I knew my universal acceptance of robot gender dysphagia would get me in trouble one day.
---
Not fighting, and don’t really have a problem with data mining. Just think there’s a logic gap in your argument. But we’ll agree to disagree. Enjoy the weekend!
---
The invisible head is cause u have 2 of the same mask in your inventory
---
Usually they have every single "below 25% health" buff active, including Serendipity's 100% damage avoidance going off every second. So most people who run those builds can get away with screwing over a person's base with no fear of getting killed
---
Get out of here with your logic! 
---
Well, our CAMPS are mobile home bases that you use in the field. Whitesprings is the HQ, CAMPs are used when you're hoofing it. 
---
In case you still don't know. You smelt it at a chem station.
---
New thing. Go to one and see the prompt
---
Their base got destroyed, so I don't think pacifist mode is gonna really gonna help here
---
Stopped reading after the hyperbolic bullshit first sentence. 
---
I wonder if new recipes will need that milk ..are mothman eggs new too? Found some of those...half expected one to attack me while I was stealing eggs lol

I have 3 relatives who have died from lung cancer from cigarettes which is a proven cause. Second cigarettes have arsenic, cyanide, and literal rocket fuel in it... and those aren’t even 1/100 of the list of things in them that don’t belong in your body.
---
Pancreatic cancer is usually caused by the inability to process certain chemicals so it’s a build up over time and you would need a fuckton of Diet Coke over 100 years of drinking it ages 20-75 to cause it so diet soda is a factor not a culprit.
---
Lungs from smoking look like this:

It’s ok son we all make mistakes, remain where you are and prepare for re-education, this may hurt.
---
That's not a problem
---
I was referring to the individuals "killing everyone," however, you are 100% correct regarding the camp-trashing. 
---
Re: edit.. had no idea PA HUD was persistent

Isn't this the exact same thing Epic Games has recently done with fortnite?
---
In my opinion Fallout 4 was just a test game to see what would and would not work in Fallout 76.
---
Name your price
---
Neither did I.
---
I try to build a full max set of each armor with the mods I want. It took a while but I finished my T60 now waiting on the next skins to come out. I already had a daily X01 so when I got the quantum paint I made another set for that paint scheme. It's never ending....
---
I finally came across a player like this 1 shots me in full PA. nearly 540def+rank 2 Fireproof+med x  &amp; still 1 shots, makes me want to try this build to fightback.
---
I'm looking at the cafe tables plan at Sunnytop Station right now - unfortunately I'm on PS4, but just server hop a few times there and you should get it. That vendor tends to have a lot of the less common camp plans.
---
True. I keep hearing how this was the case even for TNG and DS9 so I think that trekkies were ahead of time back them... Anyway I think that "true" Trekkies (as they love to call themselves) and "true" Fallout fans mirror themselves in one more aspect. "The Outer Worlds is the proper Fallout game" sounds very much like "The Orville is the proper Trek".
---
It's been a bug since beta. Many reports have been sent by many people. I know I got a reply saying "they'd look into it and report to the right people" so apparently Bethesda just doesnt give a shit.
---
server, for a moment before everyone is disconnected I can hear everyone saying "god damn server", also it notifies me that I was disconnected and just takes me to the main menu. Joining a server right after also doesn't place me back into the same server.
---
Sounds like you have passive/pacifist mode on in the settings. Which would not allow you to do damage to any players. 
---
She looked I hope it turns out that everything's good and you can actually use it keep us updated yeah?
---
Or they can give fair feedback and you not get upset that someone wants something ridiculous to be improved upon. 
---
I guess like 500c for a decontam shower? Like I’ll build it for ya as well
---
It doesn't require a special build. The only perk you'll want that you might not already be using is Radicool. 
---
I thought you had to run a build that keeps you at super low health?
---
Lol, genius
---
These ones I enjoy, because I actually like having a reason to take good pictures. 
---
i just did my 60th parade with a goal of doing at least 100 to see if maybe i get a rare mask. the thing is that its a game and it shouldnt be this ridiculous to obtain these things. and my concern with the current rarity is that people will abuse the ones that are obtained or acquired by other means. 
---
You say the poll results are wrong but because we can't verify the results, we can't prove that they are wrong and as it stands the poll is the most accurate piece of data regarding the drop rates we have, therefore, until we get verifiable data, ie actual drop rates from the devs, the data is accurate and can be used as a point of reference
---
TF2 would be an impossible play for a lot of you. 
---
This is an add-on. It's an extra thing. 
---
the masks will actually be RARE!! ERR NERR!!! 
---
Just enjoy the event if you enjoy it, if you don't enjoy the event you don't have to play it. 
---
These masks will have almost 0 importance in a week or so. 
---
Oh it is beyond out of hand i used to really enjoy doing dailies challenges now i dont even really glance at them. I understand they want peeps to buy atoms cause they didnt sell enough copies of game most of my friends refuse to buy talked half of them into it and i love the game and they do as well now but the dailies are super quests at this point
---
I second this. I want a display case for armor or weapons that actually works. I also wouldn’t mind the trophy-like head-mounts. 
---
There's no reason for this to be a thing. 
---
I’ll try sunnytop I forgot about that one all the way up there thanks
---
Ideally there’d be sliders for both but seems strange that just the PA HUD remains (don’t have experience as I’m a non-PA build)
---
I definitely do too it’s like 90% of what I post. But it takes 3 minutes maybe to take and erase 20 photos.
---
Then you have your free space back.
---
I've got nothing against it... ._. it's just longer than I expected
---
I've checked that endlessly and it's off. I thought that's what my problem is but every time I check it's turned off.
---
I have the plans. Just need the flux. But either way, I can do 500
---
Working fine for me.
---
Never said it was good 
---
The invisible head glitch is on PS4
---
Yes, but you just use radiation to keep yourself low on health. Everything about your  SPECIAL wouldn't need to change that much. As I said just Radicool, and probably Nerd Rage if you're not using them. For gear you'll want Unyielding.
---
Why did you replied then???
---
Cool, glad to hear it works. As a bonus, you get smaller patches too \^\^
---
It is not effected by the HUD opacity at all. 
---
Forget all that stuff, find yourself a bloodied combat knife.
---
Try it. If you don't like it, walk away or don't do it again.  It's a game... A digital item will not make a person happy that gets so amped up about the rarest masks. They'll just get over-amped about the next 5 rare masks that pop up, rare masks in this instance being whatever the next "big" thing is. 
---
I’ll definitely look into it, thanks! Sounds pretty beefy lol
---
There is 'canned coffee' in the game already.  Its a component in the new 'White Russian'  I just got the recipe last night from Biv.
---
Lol prove you wrong so you say get help hahaha get help your self instantly jump to conclusions with no idea what your talking about now your have nothing else to say you get afensive :/ people like you that give internet a bad name 
---
Found him once in the random encounter spot in front of the church (the one with the spooky organ that plays by itself) in The Mire.
---
What level are you and what are you normally attacking with? 
---
It’s been awhile since I’ve seen the no damage bugs. So I’m just wondering if your loadouts not good pvp wise. 
---
A lot of people have joined the marketplace and saved the caps to buy sentinel assassins armor and that shit is legit. Fired full TSE handmade clip into guy and got 1 shorted.
---
It's also the only place I know to get the toolbox and cooler.
---
I don't agree that it's a test. I think they wanted an online Fallout game filled with microtransactions simply because it's a great business model.
---
Yep single handily kill a schorchbeast queen 
---
you see the issue is that i was at work. My ps4 is at home. that means i couldn't play fallout 76. i couldn't connect. it was a joke you see?
---
Are you talk about their health not moving or your not deal any damage? 
---
Someone on a discord I’m in was explaining how they are able to get 139% damage resist and basically take negative damage. No proof on the claim but yeah. 
---
The problem with that is the converted munitions  factory would be called a cap factory from then on lol
---
Why do they include fasnacht, which is a southern german carneval tradition, into the game?
---
That is faulty reasoning. 
---
My method that had me lv up from 1 to 25 in about 4 hrs.
---
Go to Watoga, north of Watoga is Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02.
---
Check this map https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Watoga
---
In the Substation is your new friend, a Deathclaw! This deathclaw will constantly spawn at this location if you server hop, the deathclaw level will fluctuate between lv 41-91, with xp from 212-512 give or take.
---
Make a camp, make sure it is 2-3 floors high, place 5-6 turrets on the 2-3 floor, not ground level cause the Deathclaw WILL destroy them and then you. Always make sure you do some type of damage to the Deathclaw or you wont get xp, personally I make steel knives and throw 2 or 3 at it and let the turrets handle the rest.
---
You will get so much loot, especially Black Titanium Ore. Please be sure to put the unwanted loot in the blue suitcase in Watoga train station for ppl that might need it, pay it forward brother.
---
Only the last one seems worth buying to me, personally. I like my character looking high class and fashionable.
---
I want a million dollars; some things are easier than others.
---
players sell serums for 500 caps? 
---
So my 20k cap investment might be worth it? 
---
Precisely it's not difficult if everyone takes part but when you have higher levels that won't help then leave if any bots go down is beyond selfish.
---
Here's a conspiracy.  The prize bot shows up on the last day and awards random attendee a rare mask.
---
Because the game is based on West Virgins and that’s an actual town in WV with an actual Fasnacht festival 
---
I can see where you're coming from but people hunt for rare stiff in this game. If you're a high level there isn't really much for you to really do so you try to get rare stuff. And in pretty sure the loot pool is bugged for the rare mask. 
---
Ah, I see. So an error that should be fixed by the game designers makes someone a douchebag even tho they may have never heard of this. Like me. First I've heard of it. Never had an issue for game stability. Interesting "logic"
---
Atoms are a worse deal than GTAO Shark Cards tbh
---
$20AUD for 1000 Atoms can get you... One or two of the more expensive items. It's ridiculous that skins and CAMP items are somehow worth as much as the entire Nuka-World or Far Harbor expansion.
---
I love everything in the Atomic shop, but I'm finding it easier to grind Combat challenges (scrapping random stuff for 40 atoms) than to do dailies or buy atoms.
---
You're right. Cheaper atoms means more people buy atoms, and more people get what they want from the store. Bethesda makes more money, players are happy, win-win.
---
I put the fertilizer thing in a tight spot between the house, a fence and a water purifier so she's usually walking up in the air outside the fence. 
---
The truth of the matter is, that low level would have done the same thing.
---
PSN -  THE_RAGIN_CAJUN_

Just your name alone is enough proof for me to say that it wasn't you
---
Someone has to go to trigger it in Helvetia
---
Are you going to be on tonight? I’d like to buy a marsupial from you.
---
Is that just a written out southern german dialect or is that some other language like dutch?
---
I’m on atm
---
I'm lvl 180. I don't attack players unprovoked so 99% of my pvp was started by the other party. 
---
Well their bar doesn't move which I take as I'm dealing no damage. 
---
Its no different for a build using one type of gun tho. Lmao. I agree though 100%.
---
Should be able to craft flechette and dragons breath rounds
---
The real thing is even crazier and more fun, believe me
---
Thx a lot man, I will try that as soon as possible. But I have one question, the blue box in all stations are my stash, no? I mean, everything I put there, only I can get, or am I wrong?
---
I had a similar occurrence, same location. Seeming following a nuke event that had cleared. The club house only had Protectrons in it and surrounding it were only Eyebots. The oddity was that every single Protectron and Eyebot I killed, regardless of type, dropped a legendary item. There wasn't much that was very interesting about the legendary drops, but there was one on every enemy without fail. I did not do the loop of The Whitespring or attempt at waiting for a respawn to see if it continued. I was overencumbered enough and headed for The Whitespring and Bunker vendors to offload.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Doesn’t really matter it’s almost always unlootable, every time I ran the parade i couldn’t loot it.
---
Aight cool, all add you in a sec
---
Well if you keep hitting seek revenge they can keep killing you. Can’t really blame them for keeping it up when some noobs offer them hundreds of caps for basically free. 
---
Worship, lmao.
---
New survival mode coming next week,along with the standard accompanying glitches and bugs.Should be a hot mess,I’m excited.
---
Nope i didnt see.
---
Personally I like Vampire's. But that's just because I love the idea of feeling better after punching a super mutant in the dong.
---
Sad that its over, cant wait for next year
---
(Insert meme of waiting skeleton)
---
You outta read the inside vaults you missed and the road map. We're just getting started with the content. The Brewing quest and items where introduced, the Fasnacht event is going on right now, pick up the mask. If you aren't interested in the Market then you're missing a big part of the game. All the content you're talking about wont be here for a while other than Survival. Check the Road Map they made it explains everything with dates.
---
So wholesome. 
---
Agreed, it's painful. I moved my camp to an oil resource just for flamer fuel 
---
That looks awesome! I also enjoy building. Sometimes I move my camp just for the heck of it. New scenery, new design, I love it. I just really want the brick wall plans and then I will really be set!
---
Just go to the subreddit and hit the little dots. Pick your flair!
---
I absolutely love it! I have gotten so many pictures of my character with everyone. Lots of fun memories too. It's even given me the chance to make first ever player sale too. So what if a few neigh sayers wanna complain. The rest of us can have fun with it. ^.^
---
oof
---
Not the Blue STASH box, that's YOURS!
---
Theres a blue SUITCASE next to the robot vender in the train station, place your unwanted loot in there, you might get lucky and find other loot from ppl that put theirs in there as well.
---
Haha yeah it's a maintenance heavy build for sure. And needs some serious perk investment if you don't want to die constantly. 
---
You really need a good set of unyielding and/or bolstering for it to really shine.  And mutations like adrenal reaction.  
---
You don't necessarily have to run around low health all the time either.  I usually run about 40% health and am fine.  Though I still die pretty fast when something surprises me :)
---
"PvP with no restrictions". So earn your way to power in this new mode. I strongly suspect most of the people who don't want to have to start over have insanely strong builds and just want to bully everyone day 1 without risk.
---
what is an unarmed weapon?
---
I wish this gun  didn't  get  removed after  the quest. I was under the  impression  we'd get  to  make our  own after,   but I  guess not. Bethesda should really make it a syringer mod so people can use it again.
---
Well seeing your making up some bullshit just to hop on the train that is this post, “oh screw these people, their really isn’t much at all to the game when your high level except try to build wealth but f it right” , your pathetic. 
---
And gigantic costume parties in the light of day behind loud, music blasting wagons that go through a small village
---
Yea, you have a very healthy take on the game. I myself held off from launch, the first price drop got me into it, and I'm enjoying myself. I agree, there's not much to get into, at least at endgame. But I enjoyed the world exploration, and am currently having fun trying out new builds. But once that stops being fun, I'm hoping the new roadmap content keeps me interested, otherwise I'll take a page out of  your book.
---
High lvls like me need to put on a weak lvl 5 fire axe and just use that with our cards mutations that should be plenty of DMG and still allow the lower lvls to hit and enjoy at the same time. Hell any low lvl weapon will work just be kind and let people get a hit. Dont be running in there with your exploding peew peeew acting like all us high lvls need that xp or kill or loot we all know we have what we need and want dam near. 
---
Hey, sorry to bother you, but after what quest line did you get the artillery plane? Do you remember the name of it? I have completed Recruitment Blues, Belly of the Beast, and another one that slips my mind at the moment. But I still haven't found it and have gone as far getting up to trying to rise in rank for the Enclave to access the military wing. Did I just screwed over by chance do you think?
---
Yea that sucks. I was server followed by someone who took a friend's (level 12) workshop, and the invaders didn't even want our workshop. 
---
This has happen to me before, but the only option you get is Respawn or Ignore. Either one you choose they can still kill you, so the two times this has happen i just leave the server. I only claim workshops when the Challenges require it, other than that i avoid them. 
---
Got it
---
Oh wow, didnt know that WV adapted that.
---
You can flip that around easily. Players don't want to have to earn their power in a new mode and just want to one-shot everyone starting Day 1 without risk using their duped gear from previous sloppiness in the game.
---
Ammo is way easier to get than both of those.
---
Oh right, thank you
---
By Market you mean the player market for weapons and armour? 
---
Where is the money Lebowski?!
---
They follow the YouTube crowd. YouTube said the game sucks, therefore it must suck. Rarely do you see positive feedback for efforts. Bethesda has accommodated the majority of them and sadly, it’s going to hurt the population and the game. Just look at all the duper’s. Nothing but bitching and complaining. They tried to destroy the game with exploiting but expect bethesda to unban them so they can tarnish their name more and have another go at cheating. Bethesda has done some messed up stuff but they were forced to soak the blame for something that a portion of the players were doing. The players knew what they were doing. They knew it was wrong and they knew it was just a matter of time until the ban hammer hit. Now that it did, you hear excuses saying it’s Bethesda’s fault for them exploiting and Bethesda’s fault on why the servers crash. Even though it was them with 7 mil weight in their stash. Bethesda doesn’t owe them crap. Make them buy the game again to cover the cost of labor to fix the issue.
---
The game is fun. It needs more content but if people stop exploiting, Bethesda can shift their attention to actually fixing reported bugs and add content. Rather than being a babysitter to children that want to break crap or corrupt what little economy that exists. 
---
Very nice.
---
If you mean you bought a serum recipe from the Enclave vendor... well yeah. That was kind of silly though since it drops from the SBQ and players sell them for 5-10K.
---
Oh yeah I killed him the other day, raped his corpse too
---
Workshops are pvp zones. It’s sad to say this but if you are a I’ve player stay on pacifist and away from workshops. There are other ways to get aluminum and materials if you think outside of the box. I get my aluminum from silos. I go into a silo not to set off a nuke but to farm aluminum lead and steel. Most people blaze through silos not realizing the wealth of rare resources a silo has. Search every room fight every robot collect every bit of scrap. When you are at the end set off a nuke if you wish or scrap your junk and head home with your valuables 
---
Well that particular town did because it’s original settlers from Sweden I think, brought the tradition with them.
---
This just happened to me yesterday, it was super weird. The eyebots were diseased / gangrenous / etc. Got a lot of crappy max lvl 1\*'s off the bloated ones though 
---
You're welcome, also since your aim is power armor, save those Black Titanium Ore you get from the Deathclaw, you will need them for the Excavator Power Armor you see everyone wearing. Its 1 of the materials needed to make it plus making it more damage resistant.
---
Good luck.
---
I mean no that shouldn’t be a thing. Do you know how much bullshit would happen with that in the game? Not to mention, it doesn’t matter what level you are. You can join the event, play it, and earn a reward with the same EXACT chance of getting a rare mask like the other high level players. When you need to defend the marchers, they don’t have to participate in that seeing it’s defending, vs finding and collecting things to ready the event. No matter what level of players, no matter how many players are there, they can participate the same as everyone else. “Oh but I want XP and loot!” Then go to white spring and tag some enemies there, not to mention they are just leeching of high levels at that point. Get a friend to kill shit while you tag it then. That’s not the focus or the fun of the event and seeing that’s the only thing they wouldn’t be able to “attend” in the event, when they still kinda can, your wrong.
---
I think giving players a creation kit lite that can only use default assets and not make new ones would be good for a community quest/locations submission type thing 
---
Yeah, so I think it's a smart idea and have no issue with it. You're pretty good at that sarcasm stuff though.
---
I haven't ran into/don't have the time to wait for the right people to take on a SBQ regularly and I wasn't aware people were selling them for 5-10k. 
---
I've never gotten a serum recipe off of a SBQ, either. 
---
Yes, i never dwell in Armor, but weapons, plans, aid, maps, ammo, junk i sell all the time. It gives it a whole new layer to the game that frankly is one of the main reasons i enjoy Fallout, but now instead of selling to NPCs like in previous games i sell to real players.
---
Sounds about right. Since you guys were delivered a broken game. 
---
Fist type weapons like death claw gauntlet, power fist, death tambo, etc
---
I believe it just changes the graphics when you fire. It's a glitch. 
---
If you spent 500+ hours earning the gear ton1 shotnthen you deserve it
---
Do you load into ur camp being attacked by scorchbeasts in that location?
---
Got it, I don't know if I want that excavator armor, but thx for the tip :)
---
I thought about priming my explosive minigun, but considering it wouldn't be difficult to generate 2k or more a day with super duper and the ammunition perk, I decided it wasn't worth the risk.  Sucks, but that is what we're dealing with.
---
Nothing wrong with enjoying that. Very nice BTW
---
From the response to this thread, your right. There’s way more people that want these kind of things in game. 
---
Given the PA buffs, I’m supportive of a HUD hinderance but hadn’t realised it was unavoidable (in first person, at least)
---
Like ones you can get in game or atom shop because that flame x01 is atom shop
---
No problem, you can get the armor at lv 25, you can use it till you get the power armor you want, it will definitely come in handy for those tough fights, especially if you're underpowered.
---
I agree, but for those like me we should be able to turn it off. 
---
But they dont celebrate it in sweden. And fasnacht or fasnet is a form of carneval that originated in southern germany in the 13th century. Nowadays its am awesome gigantic costume party in the middle of a small village all across the region. Its different from the karneval which is celebrated north of here
---
Lol I've never seen Insult Bot in the game!
---
Username is Aishizaru when you're on.
---
No, but I do get some dogs from time to time
---
You realize how...ignorant you sound saying
---
Thing this? First we all know your doing it to upset people. 
---
Second we all know the game has bugs and issues but not broken. Saying that is really childish.
---
But I’m not going to talk you out of your views or the right to be like that.
---
I got some pieces of the level 25 armor, I aim for the t60, but I know it's a far dream right now. 
---
I'm good with the hunting rifle, but in the open I'm a sitting duck lol
---
Right on! I have 2 characters... one moves a lot, but this one stays put
---
You can join on my friend and I if you see us on. We like helping new people out.  Gamertag is Coltron3108
---
Have I didn't know about that one. Nor about the mothman one. I hardly check the atom store cuz I forget about it. Do you know if you can still buy the mothman paint?
---
Thanks! It kinda is
---
I do not see this posted about often but dense mod on the chest piece really helps against scorchbeasts and tses
---
I'm looking forward to the next big event they have planned. Maybe a "summer time/school's out" event?
---
I'm gonna have to pick one of those up
---
Had this happen to me last night. Except i  lost my turrets. They were not under the stored tab at all. Had about 5 or 6 heavy ones and it seems i wasted materials there. 
---
Thank you. it's of Swiss German origin for the town in WV. I wasn't sure if it was Swiss of Sweden so I googled it. 
---

---
Are you on PS4?
---
500 is a lot. I never pay more than 250, seen them as low as 175.
---
Imagine your favourite fasnacht event item was the one with broken textures on it, oh wait.
---
Wtf? I've never had it hit 3.75. this is nuts.
---
Lol I've been holding on to the swimsuit forever now. I'd love a lake side BBQ event.
---
ohh cool thanks. I just read the "inside the vault" articles you referred to. The legendary loot vendor where you trade legendaries for new ones sounds awesome.  I'm really looking foward to the PvP servers, can't wait!
---
Why do you say that
---
I’m not saying anything to piss anyone off. If I waned to troll or make someone upset I would start a thread, or constantly post on this subreddit. I happen to come across his post on the main page. What’s childish is people like you who defend a company for releasing a game that was in alpha at best. Game was a complete slap in the face to the gaming community. 
---
Thanks a load. I tried it and got chameleon 
---
This kind of thing is only going to get worse in Survival Mode. 
---
Players need to band together to destroy the raider scum!!!
---
I want to say yes
---
I'm sad I haven't come across it yet :(
---
I'm usually in a party with people on a Discord server, so I'll still be in area chat in the game, since Discord deals with the party chat (which is often of more than 4 people, split over multiple in-game parties).
---
Because folks will just dump thier caps and aid into adventure and then grief with no consequence. It's a terrible idea.
---
Are they jocks or jerks? Also, I feel like you are projecting some bad high school interactions here. 
---
Man its been 2 weeks since its over and i already fucking miss it
---
Probably online seller accounts
---
The sloth spawns when the parade leading robot kind of breaks down and the music fizzles out.
---
On the fence. I would like to have further details on what you lose in pvp other than caps and junk. Apparently you also lose a random amount of first aid items???
---
The path of the righteous mask hunter is beset on all sides by the
---
Inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of low drop rate events.
---
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will 
---
shepherds the weak and grinds through the valley of Helvita
---
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of rare plans
---
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious
---
Anger those who attempt to nuke this event and destroy my chances of a rare mother fucking mask
---
And you will know
---
My name is Atom when I lay my vengeance upon thee
---
I hangout after the event and find people to PVP with. Sometimes I win sometimes I lose but everyone seems to be having fun! One guy got me with a gamma gun lol he got his lost caps and split so fast... Then I picked a fight with a group of 3 guys that got in their power armor and proceeded to mow me down with mini and gatling guns lol I didn't have stims but still it was funny watching them team up against me. Support your local rader we add a fun and exciting element to the game... PVP can be a lot of fun if everyone is cool. No grief No BS just fun! 
---
If on PC let me know. I'm not on, but I can escort you around if you want later
---
My 5 water purifiers and 40 stimpacks sitting unused in my stash say otherwise lol. Withthe chemist perk multiply those 40 by 4 diluted, and i believe super duper can get some effect to
---
Sweet I'll have to grind out some challenges to buy it. Hadn't noticed it was cool looking until today
---
LOL. You keep believing what you want. Most of us see you for what you are and what you are doing. From your posts, I'd wager a guess you aren't even playing the game. Which makes this even lamer. 
---
Slap in the face. Get over yourself. Seriously. Take all your stuff. Put in a bag and get over it. All of it. In a bag. 
---
I think it mostly has to do with not getting what we wanted. Most of us wanted another singleplayer or coop, not fully online. 
---
I have many gripes about the game. I don't think it's great in any way, but it's enjoyable for what it is when playing with friends. I would not play it solo, put it that way.
---
I think more hate should directed at Bethesda than the game itself, for their PR disasters.
---
I feel like even without speed demon the hunger and thirst bars drop much faster since the last patch
---
Yeah, not going to argue with you.
---
Yeah some of them  seem like a tonne of work for 10 atoms
---
I wish the event was longer.. I have been on holidays since March 12 and don't get home until March 29, just in time to miss the entire thing.. I didn't even know there were recipes and plans you could get as rewards and I was already bummed about not getting a chance to get a mask.. unfortunate timing :( but I feel it should have been at least 4 weeks if not the entirety of Wild Appalachia.
---
Xbox one. It just ended I think. Sorry to bug y'all. I'm new to 76 and I feel a bit dumb not bring avle to make my way around a fallout game. Lol
---
Ive had guys with fatmen and explosive weapons. Come on guys. One even had a mirv he kept setting off. Really ruins it for the rest of the players. 
---
But it isnt so much the weapons pissing me off about this event but the bots themselves. Some of them take for. ev. er. I was standing on top of the gazebo to snipe suiciders and after that was done we were just standing there. Like, ok? Then in the distance I see a damn bot still on the bridge. That wasted so much time waiting for him to show up with the rest of the group and he ended up dying at the end. No one knew he was there and a super mutant was just pounding on him until someone saw him and went over and killed the SM but not before he nearly killed him. The bot became a victim of the wolves and stingwings at the end. 
---
Well im not hateful, im just frustrated. I can't play because i was suspended, then unsuspend, now im resuspended for no reason. I can't play at all.
---
😂 
---
Maybe someone will be selling things afterwards, or giving away extra masks. From the positive response to this post, there's a lot of decent people out there. 
---
Who’s upset? 
---
Because this is similar to Elder Scrolls Online where you're going to have people hating it simply because it exists.  
---
Just added you
---
&gt;I was thinking it’d be something free because the $60 is already so lack luster they might as well take that into account.
---
Really? Tons of players with over 100hrs and it's lack luster yeah ok. Not to mention all the free upcoming content. 
---
BTW I like the creation club idea just not sure how they'd implement it? I'd start with giving access to well known modders and probably no one else. No offense but when people are already good why change it.
---
 Pretty simple, workshops are pvp. Sorry for your frustrations but that's the way they made the game
---
Have fun. 
---
Not saying that some of the challenges aren't overtuned, but craft/drink 50 are actually pretty easy. Beer is very cheap to make and you can make tons by gathering up razorgrain/corn from Silva Homestead. Watoga also has tons of booze all over the tables/rooftops. Also you can still drink the non-fermented versions of booze, they count for the drinking challenges. 
---
Well that’s fine, with the total lack of damage in Adventure, they can all go shove off into psycho hermit murder land, and I’ll be in friendly invincible god hermit land  
---
I thought it just lowered the negative effects of thirst and hunger, not the rate at those bars decreased?
---
Damn, touchy subject for you I see. Take care bud. 
---
No problem: also, when 'guiding' them back home to your base, you only have to travel with them a small distance and protect them, eventually they'll get to a point that they are 'walking in place' and that's your heads up that they'll be at your camp (that's what happened with my red and gold kingyboi)
---
Just my frustration with not being able to just enjoy the game without having to deal with someone following you around the map killing and then taunting you. Will be glad when the new dual game system starts even though it will not fix this issue. Server hopping I guess is the only fix.
---
Ok thx
---
possibly, someone may of sniped it off the server before you got there, it was in the office on top of the desk at the end of "belly of the beast" top floor of defiance behind the laser grid near the terminal with the ultricite plans on it.  it wasnt a "quest" plan but an open world plan.
---
if you server hop or visit back there at a later day it may respawn
---
You know what would make everything pose a more interesting challenge for you. Put away your OP weapon and give the game a go with some stock level 50 gear. You'd stop one-shotting everything then. It'd be more of a challenge if you'd let it, but everyone is so obsessed with the my gun is the best gun or who has the best legendaries, they don't play with style. It's just boom... dead. I'm not criticizing OP weapons or that game, you should be able to play it if you want, but if you want more of a challenge, then lose your OP weapons. 
---
There's a difference between taking a workshop from someone because you actually want it and just being a dick because the game let's you though. 
---
Thanks for the smooth transaction!
---
Yeah... Well, they are, so...
---
Yeah that is annoying.  Only thing you can do is hop servers.
---
Just start a new character for the leveling ones.
---
I'm all for shit blowing up, as long as it isn't me. 
---
Right on brother. Too many people get bent out of shape over nothing. I did the parade once. Got some loot of the creatures I killed but got no mask at all. Do I care? Not a bit.
---
I've only gotten in 2 parades, first time crashed, second time completed it and got the owl mask
---
Fight back! Team up with others and fight back seriously. Need help ask and people will guide you etc. I am always down for a fight even with friends lol 
---
Wow. Yeah no that's pretty damn aids. Here I was feeling like an asshole for wanting to run a piercing, crippling launcher build. Well, at least I know I'm not the worst kind of person.
---
I didnt mean fir It to end so soon lol, sorry about the asking for help, id have a partner but roomates not complying. Im on xbox one, just in case my other comment didnt make it through 
---
Bet you just light up a room.
---
I've gotten ever mask but the rares at least 4 times and countless plans as well. I keep server hopping and the amount of servers that don't have the event going on is staggering. So I'm spending most of my time just server hopping and not actually doing the event!
---
Very true 
---
There’s no such thing as liking building too much! Looks great!
---
Are you using an inventory mod? This started to occasionally happen to me after I installed the Save My Stuff mod to fix the “inspect” bug that seemed to have crept in with the last patch.
---
The game randomly turns chat volume back to zero, so you might want to check that again. It's a bug. Max is best on my PS4. 
---
How quickly does it drain cores?
---

---
I had an inventory mod but I think I removed it. Maybe I left some file?
---
If you have the caps the. Of course ..9k is immaterial but caps is all the high levels have these days as they most of the weapons they need...pays ya money and takes ya choice. I'm not paying that extortionate price tho
---
Mule char?
---
Checked the STASH, did a little digging and I may need to start recruitment blues to get it again wish me luck 
---
When I see him, he always comes up to me and does literally nothing. After a minute or so of just standing there, he hands me the “You’ve Been Insulted!” note, but never actually insults me.
---
Nope,  their fault for being griefing dicks.
---
I feel you're trying to portray bloodied builds in a negative light Sir! It sounds more like you got sucked into the rage-based PVP revenge trap!  
---
I would also question how you knew they were bloodied and using TSE's. This reddit has a habit of fixating on Boogeymen builds often incorrectly. I run a bloodied build almost exclusively because it costs me fewer resources i.e. bullets during long PVE play times. I'm pretty much purely doing it to save my bullets!  
---
We're not all bullies and monsters, I'd wager you'd find the same type of person in every build type. So please don't blame the build, blame anti social players instead!
---
The scorchbeast doesn't attack unless you shoot it, focus on the scorched. 
---
With the water park At the north tip center of zone there was enough stuff to kill ( Super mut's , scorched, mirelurks and snallygasters ) i was able to collect 20/25 high rad fluids / glowing mass / hardened mass. Same with the 2 others in my squad. We banked violet like crazy.
---
If I vendored 1 k weapons..I would never be playing the game lol..storage wise it's a headache
---
Yeah that's a possibility too.
---
Hunger and thirst grow 60% more slowly at night.
---
Level 3 card. 
---
Only at night. 
---
Great response, this is a post I like, thank you 
---
Brahmin Plinko would also be hilarious. 
---
Gosh, I wish I could build as nice as you.
---
I can't even find a location I like. Where is that one at? It's quite pretty.
---
Again, this is a post that is spot on, thank you..I agree
---
Played with a group on PC yesterday, higher levels made sure everyone got a chance by announcing it over mics. 
---
I had already run the event 2-3 times and didn't even know the mega-sloth existed. It was pretty cool! 
---
It's waaaaay worth it if you have the resources to turn raw into stable.
---
Thank you for advising on explosives on 2 star only 
---
They can’t as the vault shuts down 24 hours after we leave. Meaning no new people could come from the vault. 
---
Is that one rare? I have 2
---
You choose ignore. You are still able to respawn. 
---
Really? I’m surprised I’m not being raved at like a said the wrong thing. 
---
Just do more events?
---
Didn't they data-mine the drop rates? 
---
Oh man... I was just commenting somewhere how I suck at building.
---
Is the 7500 caps only, or would you take some of the the payment in trade?
---
This is DEFINITELY something I want to get this weekend..
---
Even of there are new duping methods if they had to start from scratch trying to get those op stuff to dupe would take awhile even no lifing and since duping is = to getting ban it would be too hard to make a big duping circle with randoms.
---
What kind of retard gold's this shit
---
Meh, for me it's a middle place of sorts. Been southwest near the park for a while cause leveling down there is kinda nice and most people seem to avoid it but i'm trying go get my hands on the mole miner gauntlet print before the level gap to my current gets too big and it's been quite a walk or costy for a while so i choose that place beeing in between the both of them, the park southwest and uranium fever northeast. That there's 3 different trader fractions nearby isn't bad eather.
---
Haven't had any scorchbeasts there so far but that's probably because it's in the green area... and let me be clear there, neather did the other aeras pose any threath until a highlevel set foot there. When they did, a peacefull building in the middle of nowhere suddenly turned to hell and that's the thing i have an issue with... it's not the locations per se. Most of the map is kinda midlevel by default and simply scales up according to your level, it's the influence of high leveled players that's messing with them. 
---
That the mechanic behind this simply ignores low level players in favor for high levels with such a big radius and no system behind the pairing, what makes high leveled a imminent threat is a pretty overwhelming flaw by design. Any area that isn't green turns hostile on a leveling player eventually and that the xp was nerfed and nothing else didn't exactly help eather.
---
Which is an entire bank of servers now.
---
Ask if anyone wants to trade at the end of the parade?
---
Not point rationalising with an idiot 
---
Nexusmods has a few old mods for underwear. VT is best one. But I don't know, why modders don't create a lot more...
---
You linked me a comment where the guy literally says he doesn’t have any proof and won’t be providing any... did you even read it before linking it? 
---
The majority of every gaming community these days suffers from instant gratification.
---
But you can't name change who would buy that account?
---
late reply but question, does having tesla bracers on both arms stack? How does using hydraulic bracers on one of the two arms work equally as well?  Just curious.  
---
I more mean an in game duper account selling items online. Its the same name style as the gold seller bots in ESO
---
There’s that perspective too and a valid point. I’d still lean toward other available difficulties that could bring more challenges. Even with high end gear. I kind of see it as accommodating the community as a whole. From casual players, to serious players and then the players that still live in their mothers basement. 
---
Doesn’t provide proof, says he isn’t going to provide proof... hmmmm.... but let’s still believe him anyways? 
---
Lots of new camp items, and the trailer shows you what’s on the way, the seasons just begun dearie.
---
When you take a workshop, set up the resource extractors any defenses and then leave. People take it as a sign you want to PVP if you hang out there. Just swing by to collect resources every once in awhile and defend. Do not linger, and you, too, can take workshops with few problems. 
---
Dupers
---
Yeah at high luck though I'm not seeing witches, owl, giant anymore. It's all toothy and soldier I noticed. I really want higher luck to see if I can get one. Have to find/buy some luck bobbles.

Very humble abode Drax!

Last night I got a lvl 50 3* AA machine gun from it :thumbsup
---
Look up your build and needs in advance. 
---
They all had 20% hp and when they shot at me their bullets exploded lol
---
I'll sell it 
---
U on ps4? If u r i will look out for it
---
Oh boy here comes the insults

Yeah it's pretty fun..the minions that come along with her can get pretty annoying tho
---
Bruh it was $14 you can’t just ask for it free
---
He’s a random encounter.
---
What platform you play on?
---
Oh wait lol u cant sell or drop atom shop items 
---
I wanted to see what the offers were
---
The latest patch fixed speed demon for me ..before all I was getting was fast reload
---
For what?
---
there is a difference yes, but both are reasons that draw people to the pvp environment.  
---
liberators and honeybeasts are bad enough please no spiders. 
---
Wouldnt mind giant centepedes. As they are on covers of magazines in the game.
---
I’d even go as far that locking a camp gives a potential griefer more incentive to damage your stuff. 
---
This isnt possible lmao, you cant give atom store stuff in the game
---
I rock a two star furious dragon with explosive bullets...it's banging!
---
Or you can use your radiation arch as a shower.
---
If you're on PS4 I have a spare one I think. If you want it I'll sell it to you
---
Wow that's a bit much aggression there friendo. I'm just reporting what happened when I played.
---
Can you trade it?
---
Haven’t gotten one but I’ve seen someone on twitter with the Sun mask.
---
I think he was farming you for caps too, had a noob try doing that with me, Bethesda doesn't notice people exploiting workshops for other reasons then just fighting over resources.
---
Thankfully Atoms  don't lock you away from the latest content if you don't have as much.  Shark Cards in Online actually offer  in-game  money  that you can spend on vehicles, equipment, and property.   Property determining whether you can play some of the newest content.
---
Atoms might be slower to gain manually than GTA:O cash, but you shouldn't be in any rush to spend them because it's not like some shiny new anti-materiel rifle is behind an Atom wall.  It's just scraps  of cosmetics that I doubt everybody thinks all look good.
---
Interesting I’ve only seen people with the Winter mask
---
rad resist perk should be % based.
---
Theres a home near the fire station thats open to build in that has a cute bathroom. I just added plants and candles and voila. It's just down the road east from the station, left side. It also has an attic space that if you stack enough junk, like chairs and grills, you can climb up to build in there too.
---
Real quickly. You can see the needle moving when you get on it.
---
I would enjoy going through and taking quality photos in each zone, but constant photo challenges mixed with the gallery size cap makes it a spam and delete deal.
---
Depends on who is in that room...
---
PS4.
---
Yeah I had one event we had all robots survive and all I got was plans.
---
Ok I’m on Xbox 
---
Haven't gotten one yet. Did the event 86 times so far (counted the number of masks I have)... Was optimistic but i am losing hope.
---
They were on PlayStation btw.
---
Hey thats my location :D
---
Yeah seems to be the case with what’s going on
---
If you're on XBox, I have a spare.
---
+karma  thanks to you too
---
If you take a workshop you have to expect that someone might take it from you. Whether they want mats or caps is irrelevant
---
No when someone talks sense, I listen, when they insult or talk smack, in shutdown. Good post
---
Well thanks. 
---
Scrap a lot and when there’s an event going on join it. Also do faschnacht it’s pretty good
---
I like that sweet Muzak from the Whitesprings mall. Nothing beats 10 minutes of crafting while rockin to that beat. 
---
i had a great place in Whitesprings just like that until it was nuked every hour and the repair costs got a little out of control 
---
Yeah that was an exploit I was trying to say on reddit but bunch idiots saying no that just pvp with workshop. Those jerks were farming you for caps without getting penalized for being wanted, lowest scum ever. Bethesda should change it were you don't lose caps only one death to avoid the farming of players.
---
Looks awesome
---
I'll buy it
---
Have your audio come through your headset? That way you can communicate with other players and not expose your kids to that kind of language.
---
Dreads please!
---
Saw someone wearing the red old man looking one last night while doing the event. Also saw someone with the missile on the eye one. 
---
thanks!! :D
---
I think you replied to the wrong thread. 
---
Thanks for reaching out! What kind of ideas do you have flowing for your base? 
---
7500 is the minimum price we go on a full build, we would absolutely consider trades!!! Sounds great, we can get that done 
---
Check if you have the quest deactivated, I had the same issue and had to make the quest active to see the countdown again.
---
Lol anyone upset about anything in a video game needs to grow up.  This one guy I heard at the event sounded like he was 30 or something and so mad and almost sounded like he was going to cry about a stupid mask lol it's a game and ppl take it too seriously.  Ppl think they can bash and shame game companys on the internet and get what they want but the truth probably is these companies are laffing at those ppl and still taking in millions of monies. I think that's the real tactic. Game companies let ppl think they can moan and whine all they want to make the game companies think there losing money and they jump in to cater to the whiners but that's what the companies probably do on purpose.  See if the ppl think they can control and make the game companies do what they want, then they'll keep playing. Although this is just what I'm thinking, I have no real idea how it works and don't really care lol I just like to push buttons and hope for the best and enjoy my game because it's just a game 
---
Ignore my last comment. I just saw this one. The default PS4 headset is a good option though as it only goes in one ear and you can still mute chat audio as needed.
---
Thanks for the feedback, so far everyone has just seen someone wearing one and nobody has had one
---
Events are important. Loot almost everything, scrap even more. Don't waste caps on gear, horde caps till level 50 if you can. Know there will be random server problems, but stay positive. Above all, have fun with it!
---
Sorry, you didn’t deserve all that sarcasm, but I’m glad you appreciated it. 
---
I wouldn’t say a barely visible BoS logo on he shoulder is enough for me to call it a badass BoS skin. Let me put my knight paint on it with me proudly displaying BoS on my chest
---
That's happened to me too lol
---
Pretty sure the initial argument was actually that allowing current characters also allows a flood of duped items into pvp.  There will always be someone with better gear or higher level in pvp games; forcing a fresh start for everyone would force out all that duped gear.
---
I think we'd riot if people could purchase caps. I'd argue that Shark Cards are probably worse, but also more bang for your buck, so to speak (although as things get more expensive, shark cards become less of a good deal). 
---
The idea that cosmetics are inherently less valuable to gameplay than weapons confuses me. Plenty of people in Fallout 3 wore the pre-War dresses and hit people with rolling pins while sacrificing their damage and armour. In Fallout:New Vegas, a lot of people wore Vera's Dress or the tuxedo for a White Glove Society look, which gave them terrible DR. In Fallout 4, people wore suits, tuxedos, dresses, lab coats etc.
---
Cosmetics clearly matter to players just as much as weapons and armour, so "It's just a cosmetic" confuses me.
---
I was considering trying to get a jetpack, but I guess not anymore. I have 2 fusion cores left in total. I have no clue how to get more of them and I’m not really gonna be able to do anymore nuke zone stuff until I do.
---
There is a few different types of clean beds you just gotta find the plans for them
---
I didn't think to take a screenshot because I have been late to the event and didn't think anything of it. 
---
Yep,  lots of pesky companions. 
---
(I've knee-capped as many as I could)
---
Yeah that make 50 booze should of been a weekly. That's a huge amount of Razorgrain for one day, which is very limited, even with my large farm of it in camp and green thumb perk.
---
I have been saying this same thing... it's frustrating trying to help people or get help if they won't even thumb-up or thumb-down a question like: "would you like  a hand doing _____ " I had a guy send me 2 group req's last evening so I grouped with him. He then proceeded to completely ignore me as I asked what he needed or what quest he was working on. I got frustrated, left the group, and he then tried shooting at me... but honestly, it was not my fault he wouldn't acknowledge me! I even asked if he would at least give me a thumbs up or down to tell me if he meant to group with me... no response... seriously, I love grouping, meeting people, learning or teaching stuff, the game IS made for it. Hopefully more people get into "the swing of things" soon. Headsets are as cheap as $5 at your local gas station, you don't have to have a $2000 imported from Japan headset guys! Lol --- "this isn't rocket surgery..." as 'they' say... 
---
Don’t worry I believe you
---
Gorgeous! Love the lighting effects at night, and then little fenced area for your crops. 
---
Most likely the player had pacifist on and even without the damage is fairly low.
---
thats nuts i never realized or tried
---
Seeing they have been immune to damage since the very first parade, “friendo” your just making up some BS to hop on the wagon
---
I agree. I've heard people are offering pay pal to the users who have posted their masks because of how rare they are. It's very concerning, especially for future time limited events like this where it could throw the in game economy for a loop with 
---
any of the new items they add.
---
I would like to buy marsupial. Frizatronics is gamertag.
---
I hate the picture ones. I want my album filled with pics I actually want in there, not a buncha daily spam I have to delete.
---
Same on Xbox for armor and weapons. Going to Stash and then looking at item makes the info appear. 
---
Dude port over to PS4 so I can get in on this.
---
So I've rebuilt my crappy bass like 10 times looking for a good location. I want something picturesque, near water, and also somewhere that would be relatively well traveled by players either new or veteran. I would very much like my house to go with the landscape rather than stick out like an eyesore.
---
I would like a homey style decorated home, wiyh a large vegetable garden. Obviously I would want all the different basic crafting tables. I've always had trouble fitting the crafting portions of the house into the house and making it look good. I would also like to be forward-thinking for player vending and either have some kind of next door module or shop where I can place the vending machine in. Along with some signing or lighting indicating that.
---
I'm not imagining something with a whole ton of defenses, but I would like a minimal amount that would enable me to keep lower-level mobs away from my vegetable garden what not. I would also like them to kind of blend in so they don't look like a total eyesore.
---
What do you think that would run? I could get my hands on almost 7500 caps by tomorrow night if I do my vendor run soon.
---
i saw a level 130 picking on a level 12 after the event yesterday. i tried to help out and kept getting murdered by the 130 and his friends. it was still fun trying to help tho 
---
I’d go to a SBQ BBQ. Defeat the queen then fire up the coals. 
---
What do you call a family of ducks crossing a road?
---
Speed bumps. 
---
My wife got upset after I showed that to her. I laughed because I'm dark like that. 
---
Both of those are atom shop items btw.
---
I don't know the numbers but it's one of my greatest AP regen items and i'm a rifle/vats/ap build.
---
I prefer it over the jet pack or any other mods. It's also pretty common and cheap, you could just give it a try
---
Did u jump servers?
---
Well, if I get doubles of those, you'll be the first I message to offer them to. Wishing you luck!
---
Yeah pretty sure all the ones I’ve seen are left overs that Bethesda missed from the dev rooms. Especially given that every time I see a post with a picture of a mask mask it a almost always
---
I do have the canopy, and the modern and the military style but I want more options.
---
Where’s the “Staying in adeventure mode” selection?
---
Or. OR. The one time someone used TSE shotguns near the robots, we managed to lose all 4 of them, and the other 6 times I have run the event, and no one shot near the robots with explosives, we only lost one the entire rest of the times. So I put two and two together and made an assumption. I'm sorry that 76 is this important to you.
---
Best loot I've gotten from the event was from the sloth meat pile. I felt kinda bad because there was someone waiting for it to meat but I yoinked it. So it drops loot twice - once on it's body and once in it's meat pile??
---
[https://imgur.com/a/QorbJLs](https://imgur.com/a/QorbJLs)
---
You can generate them at several workshops, they are very easy to get.
---
Naw man Im not tryin to argue or be a douche Im just saying its not super hard to stockpile anything in this game. Ready for player vending tbh. 
---
Xbox sorry, amended post
---
Indubitably.
---
Quick kills!
---
Ah, only at night.  Bummer.  Well I guess it's better than nothing.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
Since I don’t care about the masks i stopped participating after my third run. It’s just boring to be honest.
---
I love it. It's like 10 of my most worthwhile playing minutes.
---
This happened to me earlier, the guy had a bounty so I waited until the sloth was about to come and I killed him
---
Do not store junk in your stash without scrapping it first. It does not automatically break down when you craft or build something. If you have junk in stash, pull everything out, scrap it all at a bench, and the store it back in the stash. This will reduce your stash space considerably. 
---
Strange. On xbox, been there multiple times today and has been at least 10 people at every event.
---
Possibly? Theyre in launch control now
---
Some of the perks like that are really good. I use sun kissed and really don’t have to carry rad drugs. 
---
It's the middle of the week. It'll pick up in the last couple of days as people scramble to get in before it ends.
---
I just need the Owl Mask on one of my characters, and then I'll keep farming the event for CAMP plans and recipes. I'm just assuming the "rare" masks are a lost cause. 
---
Got it on first parade. Didn't realize it was rare.
---
Just joined server
---
Well then people would be making more caps and be able to buy things. I don’t even bother with vendors because everything is outrageously expensive. It’s thousands of caps for some things 
---
Also, use this tool to plan out your build and use perks efficiently. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
I really don’t like the event you have to complete  (Powering Up _______) in order to claim said workshops. 
---
Beautiful! I love the elevated walkways and the way you used the trees.
---
Ooh, that's good to know! Thank you! 
---
You know explosive is a secondary prefix, right? And Tse's are no longer as powerful as they were? Unless you saw their build fully you can't just make assumptions.
---
The Vault-tec 2 bed plans are for sale in the Whitespring resort. That's what I needed. 
---
when i found out the drop rates and such i immediately thought about the rare things that got duped and put on ebay, now that the duping stuff is handled i can only imagine what people would be charging for these items. itll be horrible, and i think thats what people arent understanding when defending these horrible drop rates 
---
The economy is just fine to me, it shouldn't be easy to get money in a post-apocalyptic world.
---
U suck bro
---
Totally agree, I'm lucky to get 3 of the daily challenges on a work night now. Craft 50 beverages? That is way too much for a daily. By all means make it an item that requires some effort to make, but the amounts are excessive.
---
Also would like to echo what others are saying about having to level up multiple times in a day. If you calculate how much playtime that would take the average level player you would quickly realise how unobtainable the challenge is for most normal people.
---
Daily quests can be a great way of keeping your player base engaged, but there is a delicate balance required here.
---
This sounds awful.
---
THIS! Especially for the craft boiled water to make beer challenges. Would take under an hour if this was implemented.
---
lawl at people who take workshops then complain about getting killed over them. grind other events or just take the workshops for the rewards and server hop. if you take one and stick around, expect to get killed. doesn't matter the level difference between you and who is killing you.
---
Revenge is for normal pvp deaths, workshop deaths is no punishment pvp, hence why people abuse it like in his story.
---
Scumbags: dupers, griefers, exploiters...
---
they use absurd ultralong names, impossible to memorize by other ones, so they are harder to report or to find...
---
They could have it change for every individual player. It might be difficult, but I'd rather they completely remove the date from the Pip-Boy than keep it at Oct 23rd
---
Ditto, they don’t share the attack so we don’t get any loot from it.
---
Some tips for you, in no particular order:
---
READ all notes and terminal entries, listen to all holotapes.  Not only does this give the back story and clues it can spawn quests of their own. 
---
Scrap junk at benches as often as you can! Put scraped junk into your stash. If, when, you die, the only thing you'll lose is your junk. Dying is inconvenient but not necessarily bad. 
---
DO the initial quests!!!! You'll go through a series of small quests that are designed to tutor and to give you plans and items that will give you a good foundation. I'd suggest doing the quests up to and including joining the responders... after that, take a break from quests and just explore for a while. There are a lot more things to find than just the places with map markers. When you find/get recepies and plans, learn them, dont let them take up valuable weight just sitting in your inventory. 
---
 Stay in the forest region until you've reached at least level 15 -20, especially if playing solo. Yes, you CAN live through other areas at low level but it's not going to be a lot of fun and most of what you find for weapons and armor will be way above your level. The forest area is vast, go explore! 
---
Finally, have FUN. If it's too much of struggle or you're dying constantly it probably means you are pushing too hard, back of and just be for a while. 
---
He wandered through the parade while I was doing the event the other day. Lol
---
Ok text me when ur on,I’m on atm
---
...It's Friday.
---
Friday is *not* "The middle of the week"
---
I turned around last week and soon as I seen him he started to say something. What ever it was he didn't get to finish the second word because I done shot his ass. I felt bad because as I shot I noticed his name in white. I guess he spawned in as I turned around because you can usually hear them way before you see them. Scared the Cram out of me! 
---
Tbh while they’re at it they really oughta add BoS paint for T-51, since every single power armored BoS corpse in-game is wearing that and not T-60.
---
When this happens sometimes he becomes a meat pile and is lootable
---
When I've done it, it had a lot show up
---
Step one: make an alt
---
I only really say so because there are plenty of default options available.  If players feel obligated to everything, they're going to have a bad time grinding for it.  But if players decide to prioritize buy the thing  that  is most  appealing, then 76 already throws you enough easy Atom points for that just  from completing the easy challenges everybody completes in the first few hours.
---
Same sometimes I just block the whole server when I claim too, I never use it to get resources because of the abuse some jerks do with it.
---
[Pic of poll results](https://imgur.com/a/f023zEq) there were 3-5 more entries that had said yes to getting a mask but no to providing proof.
---
I agree.  Do not transfer my characters or anyone else 
---
They add an event with rare mask drops and not only make them too rare for anyone to get but they don't even have item for item trades so people can swap masks. -.-
---
No it wont allow it 
---
I've been thinking about starting a 2nd character, but I really want to keep progressing my first one so I think I'm gonna wait a bit
---
It's the proprietary spice blend
---
Make friends and don’t shoot unless they do
---
Also when you are doing the enclave quest you can hide under the elevator platform 
---
That's not a dead body in the corner, it's me passed out . I can't hang with Biv....
---
I'm sitting this one out to let others get in on it  but yall are awesome for doing this so often!
---
I am a lowbie who has done the event 4 times. 2 times the sloth showed up. Each time I got a shot in. One time I got a legendary armor piece that actually looks pretty good, but I can't use it for another 15 levels. The other time, I got 6 .45 ammo. 
---
But, fun was had. Not angry. 
---
Ooohhhh it's a spawn. Ok. That's good to hear. I'll go check back in a bit. Thanks!
---
Love the feeling of killing a lvl 50+ 3* legendary and getting a 1* bolstering wood leg piece 
---
I’m down to put together a team for regular queen battles 
---
Well for me it worked when I took off my chameleon armour piece. I have the mutation too, so not allowing that to proc would probably be important. I wasted a lot of booze on this ‘test’ until someone suggested this. 
---
You can
---
I think this was to be expected.  They want you to buy Atoms.  They don't make any money off the ones you earn in the normal course of the game.  The Spring Cleaning event was timed to try to clear as as many of those free, earned Atoms as possible before they started making them really esoteric.
---
Another unfortunate part is that this came right after they added the Challenge tracker to the map, which means that anyone who just learned about the challenge now will be like "Wow, these are terrible, how did other players earn all these Atoms?"  Simple.  We did it back when the challenge was something like "Kill 5 Mirelurks," not "Craft and drink 50 cans of liquor."
---
I can make it if you need some (I'm on xbox)
---
don't approach the hookers in New Reno.
---
Hmm that would be kinda cool :P
---
Because the lowest price would be 1 bullet a cap, so caps would be too easy to get
---
I spent my fallout life savings on getting a mutation.
---
I ran with it for a while and had starched genes at 2*
---
I unequipped it to craft some stims with super duper (i have 4 luck) and logged off.
---
Logged back on to find I was being destroyed by radiation(my home is in Whitesprings i need that level ground, man)
---
Popped some radaway, completely forgetting I unequipped Starched genes and watched as my 5k cap mutation flew away.
---
I cried that day.
---
I just want the bonfire plan and i'll be done since I can't get the jester mask 
---
I'll add you!
---
I will try this, and report back. Thank you for the suggestion!
---
Yeah, and the event started on *Tuesday*. It's the fourth day of a seven day event. That's the middle. 
---
But it’s not money. They’re bottle caps. Why wouldn’t there be a bunch of garbage bottle caps when there is literally every other kind of trash. It’s easier to come across solid gold pocket watches than bottle caps in a world full of garbage? Give me a break man.
---
I was inside the church by the bonfire, after the event, and outside lit up like, well a nuke. It was... Pretty cool. I ran out a moment later and it was clearing up. Was that an orbital strike? (At level 18, I ain't getting one of my own any time soon.)
---
Ah, okay. I misunderstood. I thought you were saying that the entire atom shop was entirely worth less due to only stocking cosmetics.
---
My bad :)
---
Thank you for clarifying! Maintaining the definition of rare.  Everyone is so caught up in the rewards they're forgetting to have fun on their way to the rare destination. I'd prefer to see a few people with it than every single person having it and destroying the fact that they are supposed to be rare. Don't let the crybabies bully you.
---
It's a no from me
---
My most recent camp design is an extremely open trading post with only 2 locked rooms. My bedroom and generator room
---
Please give me a flushing toilet.
---
world full dammit
---
Its a great spot!
---
Handmade rifle,lever action rifle
---
Just did it twice. Atleast 5-8 people on xbox. Sometimes alittle more.
---
I just finished my 2nd go around and with at least 10 other players, after the event we'll trade duplicates.
---
Thanks, its at Whitesprings
---
Thanks for feedback 
---
Lol, "dearie" 😆 dude, I just read that you fight a sloth during the parade or whatever. A sloth? Again?!? That's literally the one thing I'm worried will happen during this season - that it's just gonna be a rehash. Same enemies, same weapons, same quest types, same rewards. I don't know, it just doesn't seem that exciting, if I have to kill *more* ghouls, sloths and super mutants.
---
Yeah, one gets neglected for sure
---
you're trash bro. entitled whiny trash. makes me sick reading the crap that comes out of the mouths of people like you. jesus
---
Heh that'd be pretty crazy. Though a bit high level though. I could see a legendary mirelurk queen though. 
---
Gotta get the mole rat burgers too. A couple of ribeyes, and plenty of booze. 
---
What system? I kust had an awesome fight in the same circumstance where at least half of the server joined in. I was on ps4
---
On that note, I wish that the Plans were distributed more intelligently.  We know from the Powered Up events that it's possible to set up rewards so that a player gets a unique one from the pool every time.  I'm not sure how often Bethesda thought the average player would run Fasnacht, but there are an awful lot of tiny plans you can get that start repeating themselves quite a bit.
---
Who the fuck has 100k caps. I’m level 105 and usually have 3 or 4 k......
---
yeah just don't click seek revenge and they wont be able to fight you again
---
Server hop to fix
---
I used to claim as many workshops as I could when I played but if I do that now then I get someone show up almost instantly and 1 shot me using a death claw gauntlet. 
---
I understand the PvP risk when claiming workshops and don’t mind it but this is getting out of hand. Anytime it happens now I just leave the lobby. 
---
I really like the handmade. I'm in a pinch for 5.56 ammo at the moment but I definitely like it the best of all the ones I have tried so far. I also have a lever action that isn't too bad. It's just kind of become obsolete as I have progressed because it is pretty low level. A higher level one might be worth a try 
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Rifles have more variety, for what that's worth. If you go shotgun you've got the Double-Barrel, Pump-Action, and Combat Shotgun, and they all take the same ammo. Looking at the best rifles you've got the Handmade, the Gauss, the Lever-Action, and more, and they can all fill a different role. 
---
Ill wait for prestige system and then play survival exclusively
---
Goblin/Devil, Old Man Winter, Sun, Jester, and Skull
---
But personally, I like rifles better because of range. But that's just me 
---
I can see them changing it after every main dlc. But not individually. Servers are just kinda holding up. 
---
Did a couple today and a similar number for each. More than I saw on the first day
---
I’m in but my availability is based on the whims of a six-month old.
---
Your all good. 
---
I think that’s gonna be a seasonal thing they’re gonna do this year tbh. The first few years after the bombs drop weather patterns would be more intense 
---
What's the point? 
---
Yes. There's a hidden path on a hidden path in the Lucky Hole mine (walk through some vines that look solid). It's tentacles shift slightly if you watch it for a few minutes.
---
I prefer to think of it more as the "Unyielding" build than the Bloodied one.  For Bloodied to work best, you need to keep your HP quite low, but there are perks like Radicool and the Unyielding armor that don't require you to be that low to see a STR benefit that benefits all melee weapons.
---
Grinding the same event over and over is just boring in any game.
---
I've got a   2\*\* L40 Stalker’s Grognak’s Axe: 40% Faster Swing Speed if you're interested.
---
Thanks for the offer but it’s only lvl 40
---
Are challenges the same across characters? It might be easier to do the 3 while drunk with a new character. Don't know if it's intended.
---
Xbone... it was a good fight!
---
Aaronholt Farm (I believe that's the name), upper northwest on the map, has several razorgrain that can be doubly harvested with green thumb. Still won't get you 50 in a shot, but it's significant. Also I should note, they are a bit hard to spot in the field. There are a lot of other things to harvest there as well, including honey. 
---
If he isn’t on Xbox, I am and would be interested in purchasing this from you. Do you have a price in mind? 
---
Sorry for the delayed response, resolving some homeowner issues (adulting sucks)  
---
Seen that as well a couple times, usually indicates a problem with the template OR the NPC didn't properly load for you.  
---
Had instances where an NPC is invis for me, but everyone else can see it.
---
What crap was coming out of my mouth. 
---
But he needs to time the alcohol with the leveling up. Where is a common beer spot in those early levels?
---
got my serums today, thanks a lot for your help.
---
it was nice talking to you.
---
In alpha now, &gt;20 min til round 2
---
Man PLEASE, that’d give me even more incentive to go hunting various wasteland critters. Especially if they included mounted stuff for some of the cryptids. Lemme mount a Mothman head on my wall
---
Does anyone know what poses are in the pose bundle? I might be interested, but not without a preview of what I'm buying.
